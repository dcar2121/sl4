    Welcome to SL4!
    <br>
    <br> The SL4 mailing list is a refuge for discussion of advanced topics in <a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/">transhumanism</a> and the <a href="http://intelligence.org/">Singularity</a>, including but not limited to topics such as <a href="http://intelligence.org/friendly/">Friendly AI</a>, strategies for handling the emergence of ultra-powerful technologies, handling <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html">existential risks</a> (planetary risks), strategies to accelerate the Singularity or protect its integrity, avoiding the military use of nanotechnology and <a href="http://www.foresight.org/NanoRev/Ecophagy.html">grey goo accidents</a>, methods of human intelligence enhancement, <a href="http://intelligence.org/seedAI/">self-improving Artificial Intelligence</a>, contemporary AI projects that are explicitly trying for genuine Artificial Intelligence or even a Singularity, rapid Singularities versus slow Singularities,
    <a href="http://sysopmind.com/sing/principles.html">Singularitarian</a> activism, and more.
    <br>
    <br> The SL4 list is moderated to maintain list quality (moderation takes place on a poster-by-poster basis, rather than post-by-post). &nbsp;As SL4 is intended to cover new territory in advanced topics, new posters may wish to browse the archives before making their first posts. &nbsp;We explicitly aim to avoid endlessly rehashing the basics. &nbsp;We realize the importance of having forums where newcomers can ask basic questions, but SL4 is <i>not
</i>such a forum; some transhumanist lists that are more newcomer-friendly include <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-talk/">wta-talk</a> and
    <a href="http://www.extropy.org/forums/listrules.html">Extropians</a>. &nbsp;However, all list <i>readers</i> are welcome (you don't have to be familiar with the topics to subscribe - just to post).
    <br>
    <br> The SL4 list maintains <a href="archive/">online archives</a>, an <a href="chat/">IRC chat room</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/">Wiki</a>.
    <br>
    <br> The phrase SL4 stands for "Shock Level Four", referring to a set of categories for grouping technologies and ideas according to the amount of future shock they generate. &nbsp;(See the <a href="shocklevels.html">original essay on
levels of future shock</a>.)
    <br>
    <p>The list moderator is <a href="http://sysopmind.com/beyond.html">Eliezer
Yudkowsky</a>. &nbsp;The SL4 list is owned and moderated by Eliezer Yudkowsky in his capacity as a private individual, and no other person or organization should be held responsible for his actions in that capacity. </p>
    <p>People interested in subscribing to SL4 may also be interested in subscribing to <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-talk/">wta-talk</a>, <a href="http://www.extropy.org/forums/listrules.html">Extropians</a>, <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/transhumantech/">transhumantech</a>, the <a href="http://intelligence.org/lists/sing.html">Singularitarian</a> list, or the <a href="http://www.posthuman.com/mailman/listinfo/posthumanlounge">Posthuman
Lounge</a>. &nbsp;(This is especially true since some topics are more appropriate to these lists than SL4. &nbsp;Political discussion is more appropriate to the&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.extropy.org/forums/listrules.html">Extropians</a> or&nbsp;
        <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wta-talk/">wta-talk</a> lists; the&nbsp;
        <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/transhumantech/">transhumantech</a> list is more appropriate for posting technology news articles; et cetera.)</p>
