</head>
<body>
Declaring yourself to be operating by "Crocker's Rules"
means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information,
not for being nice to you.&nbsp; Crocker's Rules means that you have accepted
full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you're offended,
it's your fault.&nbsp; Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim
to be doing you a favor.&nbsp; (Which, in point of fact, they would be.&nbsp;
One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone's afraid to
tell you you're wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)&nbsp;
Two people using Crocker's Rules should be able to communicate all relevant
information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social
formatting.&nbsp; Obviously, don't declare yourself to be operating by
Crocker's Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.
<p><b>Note that Crocker's Rules does <i>not</i> mean you can insult people;
it means that <i>other</i> people don't have to worry about whether <i>they</i>
are insulting <i>you</i>.</b>&nbsp; Crocker's Rules are a discipline, not
a privilege.&nbsp; Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker's Rules does
not imply reciprocity.&nbsp; How could it?&nbsp; Crocker's Rules are something
you do for yourself, to maximize information received - <i>not</i> something
you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.
<p>"Crocker's Rules" are named after Lee Daniel Crocker.
