<h1>SL4 Chat</h1>
<p>The <a href="irc://sl4.org/sl4">SL4 chat room</a><b>&#8212;<font
 color="#cc0000">#sl4</font></b> on the server <font color="#663366"><b>sl4.org</b></font>, 
 port <font color="#330099"><b>6667</b></font>&#8212;is a place for people interested 
 in SL4 topics to hang out. As a general rule, the chat room is a lot less formal 
 than the mailing list. Friendly chat is not only permitted, but encouraged. Unlike 
 the SL4 mailing list, the #sl4 room is sometimes newbie-friendly. (Sometimes.) 
 However, we make no guarantee that the helpful person answering your questions 
 is an experienced SL4 poster, as opposed to someone who wandered in from a different 
 chatroom and thinks the Singularity is a kind of fish.<br>
 <br>
 The chat is always open and a dozen or more people are always there (usually 
 more). If the channel is empty, you've probably arrived immediately after a network 
 error cleared.</p>
<h2>Etiquette</h2>
<ul>
 <li> Although #sl4 doesn't need to stick to SL4 topics as the mailing list does, 
  it is the policy of #sl4 <i>not</i> to have certain kinds of discussions that 
  appear on other IRC channels. In particular, #sl4 does not allow discussion 
  of l33t w4r3z, sex jokes, or other "pack of junior males" behavior.</li>
 <li> Please speak like a civilized human being.  L33t sp33k, excessive use of
  smilies and vapid acronyms, and other forms of degenerate communication will not
  be met with approval (unless used in tasteful humor).  We will, however, do our best
  to accomodate non-native English speakers.</li>
 <li> If someone brings in a person new to SL4 issues for an introduction, please 
  don't interrupt the conversation with that person unless you have something 
  relevant to say, or unless the newcomer seems to be looking for random friendly 
  chat.</li>
 <li>Don't be offended if you ask a factual question and the answer is &quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>&quot;. 
  Unlike other IRC channels, we give you enough credit to be able to perform a 
  simple Web search.</li>
 <li>Just start talking. If you keep saying &quot;hi&quot; and no one is responding, 
  it's because &quot;hi&quot; isn't a very interesting topic. If you want to talk 
  about something, start talking about it and see if anyone responds. Most people 
  in #sl4 keep an eye on the channel while they work on other things and will 
  return to chat if they have the time and interest.</li>
 <li> No bots.  One need only recall the time google-bot visisted to understand how quickly a bot can destory the channel.</li>
 <li>The #sl4 channel is not logged. &nbsp;This is a matter of deliberate policy; 
  <strong>please do not put logs of #sl4 online!</strong>&nbsp;Some individuals 
  <i>may </i>keep private logs and <i>may </i>be willing to share.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scheduled Chats</h2>
<p>The following is a list of upcoming, scheduled SL4 chats. All dates and times 
 are valid for Atlanta, Georgia (aka Singularity Standard Time); go <a href="http://www.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Eastern/d/-5/java">here</a> 
 to see the current time. Note that Atlanta observes daylight savings time, so 
 depending on the date the time is either GMT-0400 or GMT-0500.</p>

 the wiki</a>.</p>
<h2>Connecting</h2>
<p>You may see a message that says "Checking Ident" that persists for around a 
 minute before the chat connection goes through. &nbsp;This is normal for that 
 machine's IRC server. &nbsp;(It isn't looking up your credit history or anything.)</p>
<p>Note that sl4.org runs on the same machine as the <a
 href="http://extropy.org/">Extropy Institute</a> and several other organizations, 
 whose chat rooms will also appear if you connect to "sl4.org" as your IRC server. 
 Similarly, the #sl4 chat room will appear if you connect to "extropy.org" as 
 your IRC server. These other organizations and their chat rooms are not affiliated 
 with sl4.org or #sl4. (Although there is considerable overlap between the people 
 who hang out in, for example, <a href="irc://sl4.org/sl4">#sl4</a>, <a
 href="irc://extropy.org/extropy">#extropy</a>, and <a
 href="irc://lucifer.com/immortal">#immortal</a>.)<br>
 <br>
 You can connect to #sl4 using any IRC client (see a <a href="http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/">partial 
 list of IRC clients by environment</a>). The following applet should also let 
 you connect to #sl4 directly if you are using a Java-enabled browser:</p>
