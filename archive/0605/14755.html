<em>&gt; Kurzweil's TSIN is not a tiger.  It is a book.  Flaws that hit people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who read books are relevant - regardless of whether the biases arise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from heuristics shaped more by regularities of the ancestral environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than by cognitive limitations.
</em><br>
<p>Regarding this point, I would need a lot more convincing to agree that
<br>
Kurzweil has succumbed to the conjunction fallacy in his book.
<br>
<p>I understand your point that he argues for &quot;AI will be realized soon&quot;
<br>
via arguing for &quot;AI will be realized soon via understanding and then
<br>
mimicking human brain structure&quot; ---- but taking this line of argument
<br>
does not immediately imply making a conjunction fallacy.   The book
<br>
had to have a finite length, and so he chose to present detailed
<br>
arguments for only some of the possible ways that &quot;AI will be realized
<br>
soon&quot; might be validated.  I personally would have made different
<br>
choices regarding which possible pathways to AI to present, but I
<br>
don't think it was wrong of him to choose to present **some**
<br>
particular representative ways that AI might be realized in moderate
<br>
depth, rather than giving a lighter and shallower treatment to a
<br>
broader variety of possible routes.  In any event this was an
<br>
expositional choice rather than an inferential error, so far as I can
<br>
recall from my reading of the book...
<br>
<p>Of course, you may be able to point out places in the book where he
<br>
made actual inference mistakes, but I don't happen to recall any...
<br>
<p>I found that book frustrating in some ways, but not due to any actual
<br>
erroneousness, just due to his choices of emphasis.  However,
<br>
Kurzweil's choices were likely made based on sound marketing-style
<br>
thinking, a kind of thinking he is better at than I am....
<br>
