<em>&gt;The Simulation Argument is a rather intriguing argument made by Nick 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bostrom. It states that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;At least one of the following propositions is true:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;“posthuman” stage;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof);
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are currently living in a simulation.&quot;

<em>&gt;(&lt;<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a>&gt;<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--------------------------------------------------
</em><br>
<p>You might be amused by a bit of history.  The modern concept of simulations 
<br>
goes back at least as far as _Simulacron-3_, 1964 by Daniel F. Galouye 
<br>
which I read when it first came out in paperback.  (It was required reading 
<br>
for all those involved in _The Matrix_.)
<br>
<p>&quot;Probably influenced directly by Philip K. Dick's Truman Show-esque novel 
<br>
Time out of Joint, Simulacron-3 can be rightly regarded as the first 
<br>
description of virtual reality, even if the topic was already treated more 
<br>
than two thousand years ago in Plato's allegory of the cave.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacron-3">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacron-3</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I had heard this argument awhile back and, at first, thought there was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good deal of sense in it.
</em><br>
<p>Stated in the above form it dates back to a specific time and place, the 
<br>
1986 Artificial Life Conference in Los Alamos.  Richard Dawkins was there 
<br>
and it was the first time I met him.  Hans Moravec was there and though it 
<br>
was probably only the second time I met him in person, he has long been one 
<br>
of my favorite people.  At the time he had a draft of _Mind Children_, 
<br>
thick as a city phone directory with him.  We were outside the main lecture 
<br>
room and Hans was rapping about the ever falling price of computation.
<br>
<p>In one of those flashes that form long term memory, I interrupted him and 
<br>
on the spur of the moment said, &quot;Hans, do you realize how unlikely it is 
<br>
that this is the first time we had this conversation?&quot;  Hans is one of 
<br>
those truly bright people in the world, I am sure the blank expression on 
<br>
his face was not a common sight!  I went on to explain that at some point 
<br>
in the future computation would be cheap enough to simulate history and all 
<br>
the people in it, and not once, but over and over like reenacting civil war 
<br>
battles or the Society for Creative Anachronism.
<br>
<p>Therefore the chances were next to zero this was the first time we had this 
<br>
conversation.
<br>
<p>This conversation at that conference was discussed between Hans and me back 
<br>
in the early 90s on the private Extropian mailing list.  Hans expanded the 
<br>
concept into a humorous article &quot;Pigs In Cyberspace&quot; 
<br>
<a href="http://www.primitivism.com/pigs.htm">http://www.primitivism.com/pigs.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now I am looking at it from a more skeptical viewpoint. It seems like the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basic premise is a common logical fallacy: a false dichotomy, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trichotomy in this case.
</em><br>
<p>Considering it started out as a *joke* . . . .
<br>
<p><em>&gt;First and foremost, it seems to focus too much on humans. It is very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely that there are countless intelligent species, assuming the Drake 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equation is accurate.
</em><br>
<p>Which it almost certainly is not.  When Drexler figured out nanotechnology, 
<br>
one of the first things he did was to look through a huge catalog of 
<br>
unusual galaxies.  He was looking for one where the stars were dimmed 
<br>
behind a front of expanding technophiles,  a galaxy that looked like a bite 
<br>
had been taken out of it.  He didn't find any.  There is no evidence I am 
<br>
aware of that any part inside our light cone is other than &quot;wild 
<br>
state.&quot;  This is based on the assumption that matter and energy would 
<br>
valuable to life forms and would not be wasted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is also likely that among those species, some would be very strange.
</em><br>
<p>Limited by physical reality and evolution of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So strange in-fact that one cannot make statements about the likelihood of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what posthuman/post-ET civilizations would be like.  Statement #2 reaks of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a Modernist perspective that there is just one course that progress 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;takes.  Why does he lump all advanced civilizations into one group?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The nature of the singularity makes the entire premises unknowable or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrelevant. It is possible that some of these post-singularity advanced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilizations progress so quickly that they breeze right through any times 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at which it might have been useful to create simulations... and continue 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to progress into some unknowable Omega Point. And others might take a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completely different path that requires many simulations.
</em><br>
<p>It is not &quot;useful&quot; in general to create historical simulations.  People 
<br>
reenact civil war battle for other reasons.  I would find it very 
<br>
distasteful to rerun the 20th century, death camps and all, but I can't say 
<br>
that's a universal feeling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So we cant say anything about the likelihood of advanced civilizations in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relation to creation of simulated worlds. Maybe only one civilization 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;created them, maybe most, maybe none, it is impossible to know with even a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shred of accuracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is also impossible to know if you take into consideration the lack of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge we have. It is quite possible that there are many different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universes/dimensions/whatever that just make this whole notion of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Simulation Argument absurd. It is entirely possible that there is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infinite amount of nested universes/dimensions/simulations that there will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;always be one more realm that is just beyond our grasp and comprehension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In these other realms or far-away galaxies, who knows how things work? The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most basic principles of time, cause and effect, logic, etc might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;radically different.  We have been learning that even some of the supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;universal constants&quot; actually change over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This Simulation Argument borders on the metaphysical,
</em><br>
<p>I wonder how many other metaphysical arguments started as a joke?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and I side whole-heartedly with Wittgenstein in believing that no position 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at all is the best position on metaphysical matters. Sure, we can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speculate and theorize but we should really do it whilst keeping in mind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our extremely limited knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Additionally, the conclusion drawn from the first three can be proven 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;false using basic symbolic logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unless we are currently living in a simulation.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It said at the beginning that &quot;At least one of the following propositions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are true.&quot; So that means that it is not a necessary conclusion that if one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the three is true, then the other two are false. All can be true, two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be true, or only one can be true according to that criteria.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Therefore, according to the way his argument was phrased, numbers 1 and 3 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can both be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let's break the conclusion up into symbols:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;x = the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;become posthumans (who run ancestor-simulations) is false
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;y = we are currently living in a simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here are statements 1 and 2 broken into symbols:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;“posthuman” stage; = x
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation. = y
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both x and y can be true simultaneously, as shown above, yet his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conclusion states &quot;x unless y.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thus, his conclusion is false.
</em><br>
<p>No because the assumption is that it will require posthuman technology to 
<br>
run a simulation.  Also you left out that posthumans may just not run 
<br>
historical simulations.
<br>
<p>Then again, perhaps we are living in a simulation.  You can't assume that 
<br>
and relax, of course, because even if the vast majority of the worlds are 
<br>
simulations, *one,* the first of them has to be rooted in physical 
<br>
reality.  For a positive outcome we have to assume we are not living in a 
<br>
simulation.
<br>
<p>There is also the argument that the entire universe is a simulation and we 
<br>
see the simulation granularity as quantum mechanics.
<br>
<p>Hope this helps,
<br>

<br>
<p>PS.  About the same time I thought up the suicide lottery.  Shared it with 
<br>
only a few people for fear someone unstable would buy a lottery ticket and 
<br>
a gun.  Others probably invented it before and after I did.  It is inherent 
<br>
in &quot;Many Worlds.&quot;
<br>
<p>PPS.  People living in simulations they could enter and leave was the 
<br>
subject of the fiction I posted here a few weeks ago.  I got a few off list 
<br>
comments, but the lack of any on list responses to the implied rules for 
<br>
the interaction of AIs and humans surprised me.  Perhaps 7500 words exceeds 
<br>
what people will read on a screen.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sex in the simulation had no biological consequences; producing food *out* 
<br>
of the simulation and producing babies *in* the simulated world being the 
<br>
two built in limits Suskulan had no desire to break.&quot;
