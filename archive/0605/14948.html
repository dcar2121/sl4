<p><em>&gt; Humph.  Turn your attention away from SL4 for a little while, and look what
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's start by clarifying some terminology.  At least that will (hopefully)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce the amount that people are arguing past each other.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For the record, I define nihilist as 'one who holds no belief however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; widespread, not supported by proof'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's where you differ from a lot of people.
</em><br>
<p>Fair play, most phrases have been used to convey several different meanings. 
<br>
POI This definition was used by the russian nihilist movement as opposed to 
<br>
being something i just made up to confuse people. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say that most ethicists (including those who identify as nihilists)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would define nihilism as the belief that there can be no _truth_ to moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities/facts/statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is ~~ a nihilist either &quot;believes&quot; or &quot;is firmly convinced&quot; that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no objective morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What you just described is closer to a moral sceptic - one who /doubts/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether there is any objective morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the difference?  Burden of proof.  Nihilists have as much to do to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince a sceptic as a moral realist.
</em><br>
<p>No, no 'belief', just where i see the balance of evidence to lie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, a sceptic could also consider that some really nasty &quot;moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality&quot; might be the case, where we &quot;ought&quot; to go around torturing each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, but if you can derive any &quot;ought&quot; from &quot;is&quot;, I think you'd be hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressed to show any such thing.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, moral skeptic would cover where I stand as well. Ill use that term in 
<br>
future to avoid the confusion of multiple definitions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (But then again, I'm a slightly sceptical moral realist.  Anyhoo...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm tempted to introduce an analogy to the truth value of statements about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future from determinist and non-determinist.  But that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-topic philosobabble :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... Back on to SL4 relevance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason why some people keep on barking on about Friendlyness is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it removes the need to quibble about meta-ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Considering your response to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; JohnKClark:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Should? If you're right then why &quot;should&quot; we do anything? You are saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; should reject morality because it's the right thing to do and that does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; compute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Should, not in terms of morality, but in terms of what will produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desirable state for us (as individuals).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like you to consider what would, for you as an individual, produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most desirable state, as far as AI motivations go...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You want a superintelligent AI to behave nicely... For your future self's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake, you don't want it to be convinced by nihilism and do you wrong, now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you?
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, consider again your first statement: &quot;We should reject traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality and embrace moral nihilism&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you mean &quot;It is in our interests to (1) not assume that moral realism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true and (1) not assume that a clever AI won't be persuaded to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nihilistic&quot;, then you're dead right.  It is SL4 relevant to examine whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a clever AI might develop a meta-ethical view that would cause it to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UnFriendly, and consequently shit on us.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, I mean both those things. I also meant that an AI which imposes its meta-
<br>
ethics on everyone would be undesirable - as IMO there is no correct, or 
<br>
single universaly most desirable set of meta-ethics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you mean &quot;Let's abandon ethics and concentrate on how we can make that AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do our selfish bidding,&quot; then you're a myopic fool.
</em><br>
<p>see my guide AI post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll presume that you 1) are shit-stirring 2) Mean &quot;sceptic&quot; 3) Are actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering something that impacts on Friendlyness
</em><br>
<p>2 and 3 yes. 1, perhaps unintentionally.
