Eliezer: Yes, good disctinction between predictions made by people who are
<br>
actually on the front lines vs. those who aren't.  
<br>
<p>As for AGI, maybe I've just been duped by predictions in newspaper stories
<br>
and missed those by people who should know.  We had Newell and Simon the the
<br>
50s, fresh from the success of their General Problem Solver, predicting big
<br>
things for AI (and quickly).  They certainly had me going.  Was it wrong to
<br>
listen to them?  
<br>
<p>Let me ask another way: what predictions (or predictors) do you favor today?
<br>
Who is in a position to know and is giving reliable forecasts of what's to
<br>
come in the area of AGI?
<br>
<p>On a related question, I agree that we should ignore predictions from people
<br>
who are in no position to know.  But even if we flatter ourselves by saying
<br>
that we can tell the difference, the public can't.  What do we do to raise
<br>
the alarm?  Can we spread common sense?  Or is this impossible?  (Or is this
<br>
beyond the scope of the SL4 discussion?)

prediction is not one that a famous scientist makes.
<br>
<p>There were famous scientists who said that heavier-than-air flight was
<br>
impossible, but they did not do any actual math.  They just verbalized their
<br>
instinctive reactions.
<br>
<p>The Wright Brothers, in addition to having a bicycle business on the side,
<br>
were also competent physicists - they built a new experimental instrument,
<br>
the wind tunnel, to test their quantitative predictions, and discovered a
<br>
flaw in Smeaton's coefficient of air pressure, an engineering constant which
<br>
had then been used for 150 years.
<br>
<p>The Wright Brothers did the math.  The eminent scientists didn't do the
<br>
math.  Moral:  Science doesn't work unless you actually use it.
<br>
<p>Now who was it that calculated quantitatively, based on previously confirmed
<br>
theories, how long it ought to take to build an AGI?  And if the one did not
<br>
do this, but dared a prediction anyway, why are you surprised that they were
<br>
wrong?
