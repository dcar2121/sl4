<em>&gt;     Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright.  She 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majored in philosophy.  As a student, she was deeply concerned with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-nuclear demonstrations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Which of the following is more probable:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     2) Linda is a bank teller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 85% of 142 undergraduates at the University of British Columbia 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicated that (1) was more probable than (2).  (Tversky and Kahneman 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1983.)  Since the given description of Linda was chosen to be similar to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a feminist and dissimilar to a bank teller, (1) is more representative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Linda's description.  However, ranking (1) as more probable than (2) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violates the conjunction rule of probability theory which states that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; p(A &amp; B) â‰¤ p(A).  Imagine a sample of 1,000 women; surely more women in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this sample are bank tellers than are feminist bank tellers.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original version of this study included 6 other statements, such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Linda is an insurance salesperson&quot; and &quot;Linda is active in the feminist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movement&quot;, and asked students to rank the 8 statements by probability. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Tversky and Kahneman 1982.)  However, it turned out that removing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disguising statements had no effect on the incidence of the conjunction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fallacy - one of what Tversky and Kahneman (1983) characterize as &quot;a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of increasingly desperate manipulations designed to induce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjects to obey the conjunction rule.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Human minds are designed for immensely sophisticated forms of cognitive 
<br>
processing, and one of these is the ability to interpret questions that 
<br>
do not contain enough information to be fully defined (pragmatics).  One 
<br>
aspect of this process is the use of collected information about the 
<br>
kinds of questions that are asked, including the particular kinds of 
<br>
information left out in certain situations.  Thus, in common-or-garden 
<br>
nontechnical discourse, the question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller.
<br>
<p>Would quite likely be interpreted as
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller and NOT active in the feminist movement.
<br>
<p>It just so happens that this question-form is more likely than the form 
<br>
that follows the strict logical conjunction.  In fact, the strict 
<br>
logical form is quite bizarre in normal discourse, and if we intended it 
<br>
to actually ask it, we would probably qualify our question in the 
<br>
following way:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which of the following is more probable:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Linda is a bank teller, and she might be active in the feminist
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;movement or she might not be - we don't know either way.
<br>
<p>We would make this qualification precisely because we do not want the 
<br>
questioner to bring in the big guns of their cognitive machinery to do a 
<br>
reading-between-the-lines job on our question.
<br>
<p>It might seem that this analysis of the Tversky and Kahneman studies 
<br>
does not apply to one of your other examples:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Please rate the probability that the following event will occur in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1983...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     [Version 1]:  A massive flood somewhere in North America in 1983, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which more than 1,000 people drown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     [Version 2]:  An earthquake in California sometime in 1983, causing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a flood in which more than 1,000 people drown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two independent groups of UBC undergraduates were respectively asked to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate the probability of Version 1 and Version 2 of the event.  The group 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked to rate Version 2 responded with significantly higher probabilities.
</em><br>
<p>These are two independent groups, so neither sees the other question and 
<br>
therefore they cannot read between the lines and infer that the 
<br>
questioner might be leaving out some information.  On the face if it, 
<br>
this seems like good evidence of the Conjunction Fallacy.
<br>
<p>But is it?  The two groups have to separately visualize the scenarios. 
<br>
What are the detailed scenarios that they visualize?  It seems prima 
<br>
facie quite reasonable that it never even occurred to the first group 
<br>
that a flood could be a side effect of a massive earthquake:  they just 
<br>
tried to judge the likelihood of a flood for other reasons, and in their 
<br>
experience they did not recall any &quot;ordinary&quot; floods that caused that 
<br>
many fatalities, so they respond with low probability.
<br>
<p>The other group, however, have had the idea put into their head that an 
<br>
earthquake might occur, and that (by the way) this might lead to flood 
<br>
fatalities.  They have no idea whether this connection (earthquake leads 
<br>
to flood) is valid, but that issue seems not to be the question (indeed, 
<br>
it is NOT the question) so they take it as something of a given, and 
<br>
then simply fall back on their estimate of an earthquake probability 
<br>
with many fatalities.  Whether they are correct in their estimate or 
<br>
not, they rate *that* probability quite highly.  Higher than &quot;flood but 
<br>
no earthquake&quot;.
<br>
<p>So, once again, the experimental design is effectively comparing 
<br>
incompatible processes going on inside these people's heads.  Or, to be 
<br>
more precise, it *could* be doing this (my suggested interpretation 
<br>
would have to be tested:  I am only giving an existence proof for an 
<br>
alternative explanation -- I could do the experiment, or maybe somebody 
<br>
already did do the experiment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In each of these experiments, human psychology fails to follow the rules 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of probability theory.
</em><br>
<p>Correct:  because in normal discourse, human psychology is required to 
<br>
carry out far more complex, broad-spectrum cognitive processing than the 
<br>
mere calculation of probabilities.
<br>
<p>People are not very good at doing strict probability calculations, 
<br>
because those calculations require mechanisms that have to be trained 
<br>
into them rather carefully, in order to avoid the problem of triggering 
<br>
all those other mechanisms, which in the normal course of being a 
<br>
thinking creature are actually a lot more useful.
<br>
<p>But now, how does all this apply to the topic of discussion, which is 
<br>
whether or not we can make comments on Kurzweil's, or other people's 
<br>
estimates of the probability of future scenarios?
<br>
<p>If anyone is out there making arguments that strictly depend on the 
<br>
probabilities of conjunctions, and if they are screwing up in their 
<br>
probability calculations, then go for it:  wap 'em on the head with the 
<br>
Conjunction Fallacy and let's all agree that these futurist predictions 
<br>
are wrong.
<br>
<p>But if the people involved are NOT intending to strictly conjoin their 
<br>
probabilities, but are instead
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) giving clusters of likely contributing factors or trends that 
<br>
depend on intuitive judgements that involve a battery of cognitive 
<br>
mechanisms barely dreamed of in anyone's philosophy right now, or
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) giving semi-independent lines of argument in which the degree of 
<br>
dependence is almost impossible to specify, whether you are a 
<br>
self-avowed &quot;rational thinker&quot; or not, and which it would therefore be 
<br>
churlish to attack because the probabilities were not conjoined properly,
<br>
<p>then all this talk of human irrationality is .... irrelevant and (dare I 
<br>
say it) irrational.
<br>
<p>Irrational, because it presumes a model of human cognition that seems, 
<br>
on the face of a lot of cognitive science evidence, to be impoverished: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;it assumes a model that gives undue prominence to the role that is, or 
<br>
should, be played by probability judgments.  There are other models of 
<br>
cognition that do not give probabilities such a starring role.
<br>
<p>If an AGI researcher's entire worldview is that thought is or should be 
<br>
based on &quot;rational&quot; judgement of probabilities, and that the human 
<br>
cognitive mechanism is extremely badly designed and can be improved upon 
<br>
by a more rational design, and if they apply this worldview to their 
<br>
scientific search for the mechanisms required to build an AGI, are they 
<br>
going to even *see* evidence that might contradict their worldview, or 
<br>
will they instead blind themselves to the evidence?
<br>
<p>Will they ignore the possibility that human cognition does subtle things 
<br>
that seem to more, rather than less powerful than strict probability 
<br>
evaluation (as in the examples of human responses to the above 
<br>
experimental questions)?  Will they scorn the human mind as &quot;irrational&quot; 
<br>
and go looking for confirmatory evidence for this thesis?
<br>
<p>And if they did start to see this evidence, would they be able to cope 
<br>
with the cognitive dissonance involved in discovering something that 
<br>
undermined their worldview?  The rational behavior, after all, would be 
<br>
to accept the evidence and go back and revise their worldview.  Not many 
<br>
people can do that: cognitive dissonance trumps rationality, it seems.
