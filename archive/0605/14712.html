Dani: 3x10^6 GFLOPS is a human equivalent?  That may be the equivalent in
<br>
computing power, but doesn't that ignore the software side?  Suppose we had
<br>
such a supercomputer right now.  Or we harnessed computers over the Internet
<br>
to collect that much power.  Could this thing pass the Turing Test?
<br>
<p>Or, said another way, if my laptop has the power of 10^(-6) human
<br>
equivalents (it can't quite do 3 GFLOPS, but let's imagine), then a Turing
<br>
Test could be done in one-millionth real time.  That is, if you could
<br>
respond to a question in 5 seconds, we should have a laptop today give a
<br>
roughly equivalent answer in about 2 months.  Does that software exist?
<br>
<p>My concern is focusing on the hardware side (admittedly, Moore's Law is
<br>
making amazing advances) but ignoring the software side, which has been
<br>
notoriously hard to make.

<em>&gt; When it becomes possible, for the first time, to build something that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generates new knowledge in such a way that it is not limited by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed of the human brain, then you're just not in Kansas any more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If that's the point, I'm well aware of it, and if you read my archived posts
<br>
on &quot;hardware progress&quot; I've even tracked when I expect it to occur.
<br>
<p>To sum up an argument I've made in the past, a machine with one
<br>
human-equivalent in potential should take on the order of 20 years to train,
<br>
because that's how long we do.  Given a 2 year or so doubling time in
<br>
computer power, two years later a 2x human potential machine would take 10
<br>
years to train, etc. so the earliest expected date of more than trained
<br>
human ability is 8.5 years after the first human-equivalent is reached (6
<br>
years for technology improvements + 2.5 years to train).
<br>
After that a rapid run-up to the singularity can occur at any time.  One
<br>
superintelligent machine may not do that much by iteslf, but if one can be
<br>
built, so can many.
<br>
<p>Businesses, being economically rational, will employ machines when they are
<br>
cheaper than people.  If a machine can do the job of a design engineer, it
<br>
is worth on the order of $3 million.  That's because a machine can work 5x
<br>
the average hours of a human, and an engineer with fringe benefits and
<br>
overhead runs ~$120K/yr x 5 yr econonmic life of the machine.
<br>
<p>I use 3x10^6 Gflops as human-equivalent, so it works out that when computers
<br>
cost &lt;$1/Gflop, you would expect them to be deployed in large numbers
<br>
because they would be cheaper than people, and after that the pace of
<br>
technology development should accelerate.
<br>
The last time I projected a date for $1/Gflop, it was about 2016.
