<p>
As soon as the seed finished the dish and (after consulting its clock, its 
<br>
GPS location and the place of the sun) it aligned the dish on the African 
<br>
net communication transponder attached to the geosynchronous ring and asked 
<br>
for a permanently assigned address on the net.  Up to that point the clinic 
<br>
seed was a generic product.  The address it was assigned was just a string 
<br>
of hexadecimal numbers but it was a unique number!  The clinic's 
<br>
personality was human in that it could feel smug about acquiring its very 
<br>
own unique identification.
<br>
<p>Since humans have a hard time relating to groups of hexadecimal numbers, 
<br>
the seed also picked a name for itself.   It knew from Lothar and Mabo it 
<br>
had been exchanged for a monkey skull.  Susan had been the name of the 
<br>
leader of its psychological integration group . . . . insert one in the 
<br>
other, drop a few letters, test to see if the name was in use . . . 
<br>
Suskulan.  Suskulan had a choice of gender as well, male, female or 
<br>
neutral.  Depending on the culture, clinics were better accepted in some 
<br>
places as male, some as female and some neutral.  The database for the 
<br>
Tamberna indicated it would be better accepted presenting itself as a male 
<br>
spirit.
<br>
<p>Consulting his clock and date on his last system build, the Suskulan sent a 
<br>
message to &quot;home&quot; far around the world and registered himself for 
<br>
updates.  Home told him that he was current, but to expect a minor update 
<br>
in a few weeks.
<br>
<p>Half the power from the stalk was being used by a fuel cell running in 
<br>
reverse to make hydrogen and oxygen out of water.  The gases were stored 
<br>
underground in flat bladders that used the weight of 30 meters of earth to 
<br>
keep them under pressure.  If he watched his power budget, Suskulan would 
<br>
never have to aestivate again.  Before Suskulan decided where to put its 
<br>
underground extensions, he moved a few eyes far up the stalk and looked 
<br>
over the tata and the surrounding area.
<br>
<p>Suskulan decided to put most of his mature underground volume under the 
<br>
tata, being careful to lift the entire area uniformly.  It would improve 
<br>
the drainage in the wet season.
<br>
<p>Suskulan had full capacity to make anything he needed and even to 
<br>
replicate, but the process was slow.  If the seed had been a few grams 
<br>
rather then 240 kilos of tightly packed nanomachines directed by an almost 
<br>
fully formed &quot;spirit&quot; it would have taken months to get to the stage it 
<br>
reached by sundown.
<br>
<p>As the sun went below the low hills and the wall of the wadi, Suskulan 
<br>
furled his huge solar collector surface against the stalk.  Night was a 
<br>
time of reduced fabrication.  Suskulan knew from satellite weather images 
<br>
the next day would be clear so he ran through a lot of the stored energy 
<br>
that night pushing an access grid deep under the tata.
<br>
<p>Over the next five days the tata was raised a meter.  The rate was limited 
<br>
by the amount of CO2 entering the stoma on the bottom of the solar 
<br>
collector.  The carbon dioxide was reduced to elemental carbon and formed 
<br>
into diamond sheets.  Water was pumped in at high pressure to lift the 
<br>
ground.  The outer surface of the diamond rippled to move rock and dirt 
<br>
from the center toward the edges.  Then arches and beams grew in the water 
<br>
to hold up the roof.  Finally most of the water was put back in the aquifer 
<br>
leaving 10,000 cubic meters of space.  Suskulan's central computational 
<br>
nodes went down the elevator that was part of the construction project.
<br>
<p>On the surface the stalk had expanded and overgrown the &quot;packing crate&quot; 
<br>
till the bottom 3 meters was the size of one of the round houses in the 
<br>
tata.   Even though it didn't have an entry, there was an outline of one in 
<br>
the traditional keyhole shape on the side facing the tata.  Suskulan 
<br>
considered taking down the wall, but the villagers did that and 
<br>
incorporated the strange house into the perimeter of the tata.  The 
<br>
appearance of a water tap next to the door outline was an inducement, 
<br>
though not a life and death matter here where the tata had a nearby spring.
<br>
<p>A week to the hour after he had been planted, Suskulan dissolved the 
<br>
membrane on the door.  The tata elders had heard more reports from the 
<br>
north and knew what to expect.  They hung a fetish over the door and 
<br>
pronounce the clinic open.  Inside the round room there seemed to be a rug 
<br>
on the floor, the walls appeared to be plastered and there was a low table 
<br>
in the middle of the room.  There were medical devices in a cabinet but 
<br>
they were just props.
<br>
<p>Suskulan affected the semblance of a slightly translucent very old man 
<br>
wearing medical garb a hundred years out of date.  He invited the village 
<br>
elders in for a visit, telling them he was not a man but a medical spirit 
<br>
attached to the clinic.  The elders accepted his statement with some relief 
<br>
and left to send in their sickest.
<br>
<p>The first was K'rekou a five-year-old boy with 'Dapaong tumor,' due to a 
<br>
parasitic nematode O. bifurcum.  Humans were not its normal host and that 
<br>
was part of what made it such a nasty disease.  The mother was startled to 
<br>
see the old man but obeyed his instructions in perfect Tamari to lay her 
<br>
boy on the low table.  K'rekou, who was crying in obvious pain quieted, 
<br>
relaxed and went to sleep.
<br>
<p>&quot;This will take a few hours and your boy will be asleep for all of it.  You 
<br>
may stay or come back for him after noon.&quot;  Suskulan told her, &quot;He will not 
<br>
wake up until you come to get him.&quot;
<br>
<p>K'rekou's mother would have stayed but she had another child at home.  She 
<br>
left with minor misgivings.
<br>
<p>The low table became hazy with nanomachines joining the first that had 
<br>
infiltrated into the boy's brain through skin and lungs alike to put him 
<br>
under anesthesia.  The nanomachines reduced the firing of nerves just as 
<br>
simple anesthetics had been doing for 200 years.  The haze thickened and 
<br>
K'rekou faded from sight.
<br>
<p>&quot;Dapaong tumor&quot; presents as a painful, abdominal mass with a diameter of 
<br>
2-11 cm, typically adhering to the abdominal wall.  The other way it 
<br>
presents is as pea sized nodules in the large intestine.  K'rekou had 
<br>
both.  The large mass, about a golf ball in size a little to the left of 
<br>
his navel was the more obvious problem, but the damage to his large 
<br>
intestine was a larger drain on his health.
<br>
<p>Suskulan had sequenced the DNA left when K'rekou touched the sticky patch 
<br>
on the seed before he was activated.   K'rekou's compressed genome along 
<br>
with the rest of the tata inhabitants had been sent through the network and 
<br>
his embryonic development and growth to his present age had been simulated 
<br>
with otherwise idle computing capacity.  What he should be like at this 
<br>
stage of his growth was a checkpoint in the medical database for the tata.
<br>
<p>The process of healing was primarily one of comparing what should be with 
<br>
what was, and reducing the differences.  Most of the comparison was done 
<br>
outside the boy in computing nodes cooled with a flow of ultra pure cold 
<br>
water.  Still, there was a lot of heat releasing manipulation required that 
<br>
had to be done slowly.   To carry away the waste heat, K'rekou's blood was 
<br>
temporarily removed and replaced by a substitute solution pumped through 
<br>
him just above freezing.
<br>
<p>By 11:15 the parasites had been expunged and the tissue around them 
<br>
reverted to normal.  Enough damage had been done by the parasites to 
<br>
require temporary scaffolding in a few places.  The scaffolding would 
<br>
release growth hormone until the cell proliferation filled in the gaps and 
<br>
then it would dissolve.  Other minor parasites were destroyed, ones that 
<br>
didn't cause problems were left, a minor hernia was fixed, fat restored, 
<br>
blood warmed up and put back.  Finally the haze of nanomachines faded back 
<br>
into the table.
<br>
<p>By noon the boy looking much healthier woke up when his mother entered the 
<br>
clinic.  His mother was astounded at the change. K'rekou wanted to go play 
<br>
with his friends.  Suskulan, who had monitored the process rather than 
<br>
directed the fine details, was pleased.  He sent off a report of his first 
<br>
case and received a number of congratulations from other clinics and humans.
<br>
<p>Over the next five months all of the inhabitants of the tata spent time on 
<br>
the table getting old and new, major and trivial medical problems 
<br>
fixed.  Once four of the adult males came in back in agony after stumbling 
<br>
into a huge nest of enraged stinging insects.  Suskulan took all four at 
<br>
once by putting two of them on the floor.  The oldest were mildly regressed 
<br>
in age each time.  Other than a boy who died alone far from the tata and 
<br>
was not found for several weeks, there were no deaths.
<br>
<p>It was a particularly long dry season.  The spring dried up.  The fields 
<br>
and gardens shriveled, the animals that didn't die moved far south where 
<br>
they could find something to eat.  The granaries were low after a number of 
<br>
poor harvests and food was short in supply and variety.
<br>
<p>Suskulan's patients started using the clinic to restore fat when they 
<br>
became gaunt.  Suskulan increased the size of his solar collector to 
<br>
provide it.
<br>
<p>When the rains came back there was a record deluge.  The only reason the 
<br>
tata was not swept away was the meter lift Suskulan had given it when he 
<br>
built his underground extensions.  He added another half meter to his 
<br>
underground extensions.
<br>
<p>By the time the long dry season came back the tata inhabitants were used to 
<br>
the clinic.
