<p>&quot;Loading the dice against free will:
<br>
A battle is waging in physics that could strip us of all sense of personal
<br>
responsibility&quot;
<br>
by Bryan Appleyard
<br>
<p><p>How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? Tricky. Was it inevitable
<br>
that I should write this and that, now, you should be reading it? Even
<br>
trickier.
<br>
<p>The angels-pin question was originally posed as a joke. It lampooned the
<br>
arcane and futile speculations of medieval theologians. They pondered the
<br>
nature of the world on the basis of faith and, in our terms, profound
<br>
ignorance. We have hard science. We have moved beyond such nonsense. Or have
<br>
we?
<br>
<p>Gerard ’t Hooft of Utrecht University is one of the world’s great
<br>
physicists. In 1999, along with Martin Veltman, he won the Nobel prize “for
<br>
elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in physics”.
<br>
But, like all physicists, he has a problem, a problem so huge that, daily,
<br>
it threatens to undermine the entire fabric of his discipline.
<br>
<p>The problem is complex — some say it is beyond solution by the human mind —
<br>
but it can be simply stated. Relativity and quantum theory are the two great
<br>
triumphs of modern physics. The first explains the behaviour of very big
<br>
things like planets, the second the behaviour of very small things like
<br>
subatomic particles. They both lie, currently, beyond refutation. Planets do
<br>
behave as relativity predicts and subatomic particles obey quantum theory —
<br>
if they didn’t I couldn’t now be writing this on a computer and you would
<br>
not be able to watch the World Cup on television.
<br>
<p>The problem is that they contradict each other. Relativity is a “classical
<br>
theory”, it can be demonstrated to act through known processes of cause and
<br>
effect. Quantum theory is not. Subatomic particles behave like
<br>
schizophrenics on acid. They seem to be telling us that the world is
<br>
indeterminate, unpredictable and completely lacking in anything resembling
<br>
our common-sense understanding of cause and effect.
<br>
<p>Einstein hated this, arguing that “God does not play dice”. There must be
<br>
something we didn’t know, some “hidden variables” that lay behind quantum
<br>
phenomena that would, one day, return the quantum world safely to the bosom
<br>
of classical physics. To which the quantum theorists’ response is: God does
<br>
not play dice but only because he runs the casino. The indeterminacy of
<br>
quantum phenomena is real and final, it is just the way the universe is
<br>
made. Enter ’t Hooft.
<br>
<p>He has just published a paper arguing that, in effect, Einstein was right.
<br>
There are recognisable systems of cause and effect underlying quantum
<br>
interactions. There is a hidden reality which consists of “states” that do
<br>
behave deterministically. We don’t see them because they are so small and
<br>
because their actions are very brief. What we see is only an outcome that
<br>
appears to have no cause.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, over at Princeton University, two of the world’s great
<br>
mathematicians, John Conway and Simon Kochen, have produced another paper —
<br>
The Free Will Theorem — arguing exactly the opposite: that the world is
<br>
indeed finally and absolutely indeterminate.
