<em>&gt; snip

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can you give a reasonable account of how &quot;emotion compassion&quot; other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that directed to relatives would have improved reproductive success
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the genes building brain structures for it to become common?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Sure, firstly the emotion of compassion is a direct cause of cooperation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Those who had others cooperate with them would have a survival advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;compassionate would be more likely to recieve reciprocal cooperation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sorry, but evolution just does not work that way.  As an example, take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hypothetical stone age human with great compassion for other humans, so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great that he gives all he has to hungry people he meets on the way back 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a hunt and his kids starve as a result.  The next generation has less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this quality.
</em><br>
<p>Its a question of balance and degree. Your argument is the reason why most 
<br>
people today do not show that level of compassion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People *do* engage in reciprocal cooperation because it is in *their* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest (and the interests of their genes) to do so.  There is a *vast* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature on the subject.  Try &quot;Robert Axelrod&quot; or &quot;tit for tat&quot; in Google 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to access it by the ton.  Serious studies have found that humans have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special mental circuits to detect cheaters and even mechanisms to punish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>Sure. But that doesnt mean they dont feel compassion as well. Not all the 
<br>
time, and often not as strongly as they feel other things, but they do feel 
<br>
compassion. It takes a lot less intelligence to cooperate based on emotional 
<br>
compassion, than it does to figure out when to cooperate solely based on self 
<br>
interest (which people obviously also feel). Thus compassion is an 
<br>
evolutionary advantage. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;apparently selfless compassion may well have been an advantage in mating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mating is only a small part of &quot;reproductive success.&quot;  Perhaps you mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding a mate?  Even having a lot of kids is not success if none of *them* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have children.  In such examples of the hunter-gatherer life style (the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; EEA) as have been studied, bringing back a lot of meat is the most likely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to get more nooky.  Not &quot;selfish compassion.&quot;  This is well known.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can show you how to research it if you need help.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but ceteris paribus, compassion helps - so there will be slight 
<br>
selection pressures towards it. No reason why you cant both bring back lots of 
<br>
meat *and* show *some* compassion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not sure what you mean by &quot;emotional social conformity&quot; much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; *that* would have contributed to reproductive success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;When people feel an emotional need to act/think in a similar fasion to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;arround them. Doing so would a) speed up learning - survival advantage, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and b)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;make cooperation easier - again survival advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Half the tribe runs off a cliff and is killed by the fall on the rocks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below.  Is it a survival advantage for the rest to follow?
</em><br>
<p>Again, its not total. It exists to a certain extent, and is in 
<br>
conflict/balance with other emotions. But it does exist because in the 
<br>
*majority* of situations it is a survival advantage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I make the case in URL I cited up thread that there are times where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; xenophobic memes take over the minds of a tribe's warriors and as a result 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they go out on a do or die mission against the tribe in the next 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valley.  But they are doing it in a situation where from their gene's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint, there is little other choice.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, again, compassion is not total, and only manifests under certain 
<br>
conditions (as this is the most survival advantageous way). However, in modern 
<br>
society, the conditions are almost always those which manifest compassion.
