<p>
After reading a particularly lucid post form a list member recently, I went
<br>
off and googled them (so that probably means I have at some point googled
<br>
you, dear reader, too; maybe time to go off and egosurf and make sure your
<br>
lucky link isn't an ex slagging you off?) and ended up at one of their
<br>
blogs: <a href="http://future-spirituality.blogspot.com/">http://future-spirituality.blogspot.com/</a>.
<br>
<p>Now like a lot of blokes it seems I'm an atheist-since-birth Dawkins-lover
<br>
and my wife is the namby-pamby spritualist and deist/semi-agnostic so
<br>
opening a url with 'spritiuality' in the anchor was somewhat of a novelty.
<br>
I'm definitely having issues with putting 'god' in a posting title put it
<br>
that way.
<br>
<p>Now aside from anything else on the site there was one quote that evoked a
<br>
bit of a Singulatarian reaction in me:
<br>
<p>&quot;Whether God Is or Will Be is equivalent in truth.&quot;
<br>
<p>Following through on this from an SL4 perspective:
<br>
- A future post-human jupiter-brain hive-mind eschaton etc can be termed as
<br>
being equivalent to the presently popular perception of 'god' - All knowing,
<br>
all seeing, all powerful, all singing and dancing yada yada yada.
<br>
- No matter when we or our descendants achieve 'godhood', as soon as this
<br>
future god beats FTL, we suddenly have a case for god as-of-now.
<br>
<p>Which is a bit scary for this little atheist. Maybe all these wack-jobs are
<br>
in fact tuned in to doppler echoes of our future god-self. It's a rather
<br>
mortifying prospect to think that the pope has a better handle on posthuman
<br>
superintelligence than I do.
<br>
<p>Taking this premise a little bit further throws up a couple more
<br>
propositions:
<br>
- Future god isn't going to mess with it's own historical light cone. Hence
<br>
no visitations, obelisks, miracles of note, etc. i.e. no possible validation
<br>
of the hypothesis. Even if you did come close to proving future god will
<br>
exist, said god might have something eschation-style to say about it.
<br>
Suffice to say I'll need more than dodgy waffling in order to suddenly pop
<br>
out of existence :-). Now if only the same could not be said for the ID
<br>
people...
<br>
- If future god comes about via AGI, then a good portion of you bunch are
<br>
its direct progenitors.
<br>
- If you're a direct progenitor to an AGI, your future is kind of written.
<br>
Even if there are FTL/timetravel-breaking events caused by quantum
<br>
physics/multidimensionality etc 'it' will be sure to keep tabs on you to
<br>
make sure the dice always roll the way they did in it's original history.
<br>
- Free will: if you've got it, then you probably don't matter in
<br>
future-god/agi terms.
<br>
<p>So you've either got free will or you matter to the future - how do you guys
<br>
like _them_ apples? :-)
<br>
<p>(All very bluesky/scifi but hopefully an interesting thought expirement
<br>
nonetheless...)
