</em><br>
<p>I will suggest that there are two bounds to prediction of technological
<br>
progress.
<br>
<p>The far bound is that of theoretical possibility, what _can_ be done given
<br>
sufficient time. We have - we are - existence proof that AGI and
<br>
nanotechnology are possible, so we can be reasonably confident that if
<br>
progress can be sustained, we'll get there eventually. (In contrast to e.g.
<br>
faster than light travel, where we have no basis for any such belief.) This
<br>
bound has been extensively discussed, so I won't dwell further on it.
<br>
<p>The near bound is the horizon of predictability, what _will_ be done given a
<br>
certain amount of time. I haven't seen this one discussed previously, but I
<br>
will claim it is 1-2 decades, since this is empirically how long it takes
<br>
for all the practical problems involved in deploying a technology to be
<br>
solved under optimal conditions. That is, while it can take much more than
<br>
1-2 decades for a technology to make it from the lab to use beyond a core of
<br>
early adopters, it doesn't take less.
<br>
<p>So given that a technology exists in the laboratory today (e.g. carbon
<br>
nanotubes), we can't predict that it _will_ see commercial deployment within
<br>
20 years; but given that it doesn't exist in the laboratory today (e.g.
<br>
fusion power, AGI, nanotechnology) we can predict that it _won't_.
<br>
<p>Beyond that, I don't think it's possible to predict more accurately than
<br>
random chance.
