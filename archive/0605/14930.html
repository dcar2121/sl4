Vernor Vinge's newest novel RAINBOW'S END is not set in the far-future
<br>
universe of his last two novels (A FIRE UPON THE DEEP and A DEEPNESS IN THE
<br>
SKY) but in the near future mere decades from now. Below is the &quot;Author's
<br>
Note&quot; that Vinge wrote for the latest Science Fiction Book Club newsletter,
<br>
where RAINBOW'S END is the featured selection.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards,
<br>

<br>
<p>....................................................
<br>
<p>&quot;My last two novels took place in interstellar space, thousand of years in
<br>
the future. I intend to revisit those worlds, but in RAINBOW'S END I'm back
<br>
close to home both in space (San Diego county, where I've lived for most of
<br>
my adult life) and time (less than 20 years from now).
<br>
<p>&quot;As an author, I'm nervous writing about this period: fiction set in the
<br>
near future is very likely to be scooped or surpassed by what is **already**
<br>
happening. (We science fiction writers have much more wiggle room than when
<br>
we spin interstellar adventures.)
<br>
<p>&quot;As a member of the human race, I'm very nervous **living** in this period!
<br>
There are social, technological, military, disease, and climatic threats
<br>
that together make us wonder if the human race can survive.
<br>
<p>&quot;If we do survive, I think we'll get that Technological Singularity. In the
<br>
meantime, this narrow passage in human history is as scary and desperate as
<br>
any melodrama. Of course, that's also the great virtue in near-future
<br>
science fiction. I set RAINBOW'S END with something like an ordinary family;
<br>
much of their world looks like ours, but with a weirdness that I hope shows
<br>
how we might survive.&quot;  -- Vernor Vinge
