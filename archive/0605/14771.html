based on field audits by organisations such
<br>
<em>&gt; as Coopers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lybrand, KPMG, and HMCE (the UK's Customs and Excise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department). Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 54 spreadsheets audited between 1997 and 2000, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fewer than 49 were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found to contain significant errors - a defect rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 91 per cent. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more recent exercise, every single one of 30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project financing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreadsheets scrutinised had at least one mistake.

<p>Okay, so we know humans are fallible.  That's been
<br>
going on forever.  Dionysius Exiguus (Dennis the
<br>
Short), the monk who created our system of dating
<br>
years since Christ's birth got it wrong. This
<br>
leads to the absurdity of Christ being born approx
<br>
4-7 BC.  But then you try to do a long string of
<br>
calculations in Roman numerals.
<br>
<p>Knowing that humans are fallible (and hardware too,
<br>
just not as often: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/0,,3715_13965,00.html?redir=CORPR01">http://www.amd.com/us-en/0,,3715_13965,00.html?redir=CORPR01</a>
<br>
<p>the question is what is the appropriate amount of
<br>
error checking for a given situation.  The bigger
<br>
the consquences of an error, and the more likely
<br>
an error can happen, the more error checking you
<br>
should do.
<br>
<p>In the case of &quot;accounting errors&quot; that lead to
<br>
restating a company's financial results, they should
<br>
probably have had a few more people checking the
<br>
numbers, and it is worth questioning whether they
<br>
even had a plan for error checking.
<br>
<p>In the case of the Space Station's software (which
<br>
I was a tester for), the consequences of losing a
<br>
multi-billion dollar asset, the lives of the crew,
<br>
and the knowledge from future research onboard were
<br>
so great that a lot of effort went in to getting it
<br>
right.  Despite that, a handful of errors made it
<br>
into orbit.  Knowing that was possible, the Station
<br>
was designed with distributed redundant systems, so
<br>
no single hardware, sofware, or human operator error
<br>
was likely to lead to a disaster.
<br>
<p>In the case of an AGI, or replicating systems
<br>
(nano-, bio-, or robo-tech), or other manmade items
<br>
with potentially existential consequences if they
<br>
go bad, what is the proper amount of effort in
<br>
avoiding errors?  And are you guys working on AGI
<br>
development putting that effort in?  Are the risks
<br>
in developing an AGI less than the reduction in
<br>
other risks if you have an AGI?
