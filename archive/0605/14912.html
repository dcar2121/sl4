<p><em>&gt; suspending ones disbelief concerning morality in everyday life may well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to a happier more fulfilling human life. However, once radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman  technologies arrive, this will no-longer be nescissarilly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true.
</em><br>
<p>I would think that for a transhuman morality would be even more important
<br>
than it is for us. If you are a Jupiter brain it would be critical to have a
<br>
good relationship with other Jupiter brains as a war between them would
<br>
likely be rather unpleasant for them and anything else in the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I define nihilist as 'one who holds no belief however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widespread, not supported by proof'.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to believe that your existence is better than your nonexistence,
<br>
and I'll bet you believe pleasure is better than pain, but I've not seen any
<br>
proof of that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A moral nihilist could have all your pleasurable states of mind by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognising this (as I do) and suspending his disbelief most of the time -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without cleaving blindly to moralistic dogma.
</em><br>
<p>That could be the explanation of the Fermi Paradox, the reason we can't find
<br>
any ET's. If it were possible to change your emotions to anything you
<br>
wanted, alter modes of thought, radically change your personality, swap your
<br>
goals as well as your philosophy of life at the drop of a hat it would be
<br>
very dangerous. Once you change yourself you may not want to change back,
<br>
even if your behavior became bizarre or suicidal.
<br>
<p>Ever want to accomplish something but been unable to because it's difficult,
<br>
well just change your goal in life to something simple and do that; better
<br>
yet, flood your mind with a feeling of pride and self satisfaction and don't
<br>
bother accomplishing anything at all. Think all this is a terrible idea and
<br>
stupid as well, no problem, just change your mind (and I do mean CHANGE YOUR
<br>
MIND) now you think it's a wonderful idea.
<br>
<p>Complex mechanisms don't do well in positive feedback loops, not
<br>
electronics, not animals, not people, not ET's and not even Jupiter brains.
