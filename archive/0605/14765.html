Sometimes fiction is the best way to get an idea across.
<br>
<p>This is the first fifth of the second chapter of a novel I have been 
<br>
working on set 100 years in the future.  The main thread of the story is 
<br>
about 3 siblings who are crossing a close-to-deserted North America in a 
<br>
train--a bit of a summer vacation story.  It just assumes that people were 
<br>
able to build friendly AIs.  This is a flashback of about 60 years from the 
<br>
main story line and a shift to Africa to explain where the population went.
<br>
<p>SL4 really isn't for fiction so if the list snipper want to cut it off, 
<br>
that's fine by me.  If you they do and you want to read the rest of the 
<br>
chapter email me.

Writing from the Mortmain Mountains (look it up)
<br>
<p>Chapter 2
<br>
<p>December 2041
<br>
<p>Several kilometers off the crumbling road between Mango and Dapaong, a mud 
<br>
walled tata
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.travel-pic.net/index.php?name=Our_Galleries&amp;cid=17&amp;ph=tata4">http://www.travel-pic.net/index.php?name=Our_Galleries&amp;cid=17&amp;ph=tata4</a><br>
<p>of 21 traditional round houses with palm frond roofs was set against the 
<br>
wall of a wide wadi. The tata incorporated two rusting metal roofed 
<br>
buildings that were too hot to live in during the dry season (which was 
<br>
just starting) but made adequate storage sheds.  Outside the wall were more 
<br>
than a dozen melted-down-to-stumps ruins of the round houses--the result of 
<br>
smallpox that had slopped deep into Africa after being released by a 
<br>
desperate Russia during the &quot;-stan&quot; wars on their southern border.
<br>
<p>Rumors of miracle working strangers had been rife for weeks among the 
<br>
Tamberma (TAHM-ber-mah) so when a heavy set black man drove a Land Rover 
<br>
over the marginal track to the tata in the clear light of a late afternoon 
<br>
it was not a complete surprise.  The Land Rover had hundreds of little 
<br>
hooks welded on it.  On many of the hooks were hung fetishes of obvious 
<br>
potency.
<br>
<p>Lothar, the driver, was dressed in lightweight khaki shorts, and a light 
<br>
fishnet shirt.  He wore old running shoes without socks; an outlandish 
<br>
Australian bush hat folded up on one side over his thick gray hair, and 
<br>
carried a pouch at his belt.  His companion, Mabo, was armed with an 
<br>
AK-47.  Mabo sported cut off 501 jeans, a ragged red tee shirt and a fairly 
<br>
new pair of running shoes.  In place of a hat he had an American-style 
<br>
bright blue &quot;do-rag&quot; over a reversed baseball hat.
<br>
<p>Lothar introduced himself in Tamari with more than a hint of Ditamari, but 
<br>
could be understood.  His ethnic background was hard for the villagers to 
<br>
judge, there seemed to be a lot of European in his features, but he was as 
<br>
dark as the villagers.  (Lothar's blackness was in fact due to his media 
<br>
skin being set to &quot;dark.&quot;)  Mabo had features more typically African.  Both 
<br>
of them moved with the easy grace of the rejuvenated.
<br>
<p>The tata inhabitants greeted both cordially.  Rich visitors had been common 
<br>
a generation ago but were so rare now that the children hung back and did 
<br>
not beg.
<br>
<p>Lothar and Mabo turned out to be good guests, providing several large tins 
<br>
of meat and a sack of ground corn.  Two of the tins were opened, mixed with 
<br>
corn and along with local vegetables cooked up by the women into a communal 
<br>
meal.  During the repast, Lothar was asked the provenance of his name.
<br>
<p>&quot;One hundred years ago an African, a &quot;Prince of the Seven Nations,&quot; named 
<br>
Lothar lived many day's walks from here.&quot;  Lothar pointed vaguely to the 
<br>
southeast.
<br>
<p>&quot;A powerful white magician, Mandrake, came to Africa to learn our 
<br>
magic.&quot;  This visibly impressed the villagers.
<br>
<p>&quot;Prince Lothar became Mandrake's friend.  He gave up his claim to be king 
<br>
and went across the sea to be Mandrake's companion.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I carry his name and his mana.&quot;  Lothar touched his hat--which morphed 
<br>
into a fez and then with another touch into a magician top hat.  A third 
<br>
touch brought the hat, which was really a mass of preprogrammed utility 
<br>
fog, back to the bushman hat configuration.
<br>
<p>There was a good deal of ooing and ahhing over this, partly because the 
<br>
ambiguities of the language made it possible that Lothar was a 
<br>
prince.  Well, anyone with a Land Rover and an armed servant had to be 
<br>
something special.
<br>
<p>Lothar's mission (explained to the elders when the children had gone to 
<br>
bed) was to trade for one of the tata's fetishes.
<br>
<p><a href="http://p.vtourist.com/1401894-Mummified_monkey_at_the_fetish_market-Togo.jpg">http://p.vtourist.com/1401894-Mummified_monkey_at_the_fetish_market-Togo.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;I am fated to experience a great danger.&quot;  Lothar told the tata dwellers.
<br>
<p>This boggled the tata elders.  What would a man with a Land Rover and an 
<br>
armed guard consider great danger?
<br>
<p>&quot;I was instructed by a powerful seer 'Foundation Gates' to obtain a 
<br>
protective fetish from as many Tamberna tatas as possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The only thing I have to trade for one of your valuable and powerful 
<br>
fetishes is a seed that grows into a clinic.&quot;
<br>
<p>The village elders excused themselves to consider Lothar's offer apart.
<br>
<p>(Colloquial translation)
<br>
<p>&quot;The dude's stone crazy!&quot; said Elder 1.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yeah, but that's no reason not to rip him off,&quot; commented Elder 2.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think we can get any more canned meat, or corn meal.  The kids 
<br>
looked.&quot; said Elder 3.
<br>
<p>&quot;We have plenty of fetishes from the houses of people who died of the pox.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;He didn't say he needed one that worked.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Do you think this 'clinic seed' is worth anything?&quot;
<br>
<p>The nearest medical help was day's walk for a healthy person.  With fuel 
<br>
for wheeled transport being hard to get, the seriously sick or injured 
<br>
would sometimes die on the way.
<br>
<p>&quot;Strange tales have come from the North, it might be.&quot;
<br>
<p>After some hard bargaining, the tata elders swapped a prime monkey skull 
<br>
fetish for a &quot;clinic seed.&quot;  The planting was to be made in the morning 
<br>
since the Land Rover was parked outside the wall.
<br>
<p>In the middle of the night there was an appalling inhuman scream.  The 
<br>
local leopard had made an unwise decision to mark the strange smelling 
<br>
object that had intruded into his territory.  Unfortunately for the 
<br>
leopard, urine is a decent conductor at 50,000 volts.   Fortunately for the 
<br>
tata, the cat was not pointed at the tata entrance when it sprayed. The 
<br>
leopard stopped to lick his tingling privates after bounding half a 
<br>
kilometer.
<br>
<p>Mabo, who slept in the Land Rover, turned off the high voltage anti theft 
<br>
circuit before he got out in the morning.
<br>
<p>Breakfast was a small amount of left over dinner and portions of millet 
<br>
porridge.  After eating Lothar accepted his newly acquired fetish and hung 
<br>
it on an empty hook.  He and Mabo maneuvered the Land Rover to the spot 
<br>
picked by the elders.  Lothar and Mabo got between the seats and the seed 
<br>
and pushed the half cubic meter &quot;clinic seed&quot; to the back of the Land Rover 
<br>
with their legs.  There were fabric loops in the top and with the help of 
<br>
some stout poles and half a dozen men from the tata, they got it on the 
<br>
ground and moved into a place where the village walls could be extended to 
<br>
it when it grew up.
<br>
<p>&quot;In order for it to grow properly and to know to whom it belongs, it must 
<br>
be touched here on this sticky patch by everyone in the tata.&quot;  Most of the 
<br>
tata members were close by watching the &quot;planting&quot; so this went quickly.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now it needs water so it can start to grow.&quot;  Lothar said.  Being farmers, 
<br>
this made sense so they dutifully poured 100 liters of water into a hole in 
<br>
the top of the seed.  Fortunately the spring they used was not far away and 
<br>
this soon after the rainy season was flowing well.
<br>
<p>As soon as the seed had enough water for cooling, it started venting a 
<br>
little steam and &quot;growing&quot; (assembling) a stalk.  The stalk came out of the 
<br>
hole where the water had been poured and shot up two meters in 
<br>
minutes.  Diamond tipped roots augured into the ground anchoring the seed 
<br>
so a gust of wind would not tip it over.
<br>
<p>The stalk, which started a featureless tan, turned black at the top, and 
<br>
then the blackness flowed half way down the stalk.  It elaborately flowed 
<br>
and folded, developing shifting swirls of colors like the skin of an Indigo 
<br>
snake.  Then the opalescent black surface lifted away from the stalk like 
<br>
an opening umbrella.  It flattened out, the stalk bent like a sunflower and 
<br>
the solar absorbers faced the morning sun.   At this point it looked like a 
<br>
black beach umbrella growing out of a packing crate.
<br>
<p>The seed now had 2 kW of power available and &quot;woke up.&quot;  It exchanged 
<br>
information by IR with Lothar and Mabo verifying that it had passed 
<br>
diagnostics tests and that it was a happy clinic seed.
<br>
<p>Lothar and Mabo took leave of the tata after reassuring the elders that 
<br>
their seed would finish growing up in a week and open.  If the seed needed 
<br>
help its spirit would call to them and they would come back.  And finally, 
<br>
when it opened they should hang another fetish on the hook it would grow 
<br>
over the door and send in the sickest first.
<br>
<p>As they were driving away on the seldom-traveled track, Mabo broke out 
<br>
laughing.
<br>
<p>&quot;Those hicks were sure they took advantage of you.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;They did!  You got to sleep in the Rover. Next time's your turn.  You get 
<br>
'de lice and I tote 'de gun.&quot;  Lothar joked back.
<br>
<p>Lothar's hair slowly turned black while Mabo's became a cap of kinky white 
<br>
curls as they swapped roles.
<br>
<p>&quot;This one was easy even with banging my head on the steering wheel when the 
<br>
leopard pissed on the tyre.&quot;  Mabo rubbed his head.
<br>
<p>&quot;I sure hope we don't get another where some kid has a laptop, a satellite 
<br>
link and starts telling the elders what 'clinic seeds' do.  That one was 
<br>
awful.&quot;  Lothar made this comment over the grinding noise of the Land Rover 
<br>
climbing a low place in the bank of the wadi.
<br>
<p>Far to the north and a dozen seed plantings ago, village elders had figured 
<br>
they were in over their heads with this &quot;clinic seed&quot; deal.'
<br>
<p>They assigned a computer savvy 10 year-old to discuss with Lothar and Mabo 
<br>
just what this &quot;clinic seed&quot; did.  Lothar and Mabo eventually planted a 
<br>
seed in that village but only after setting up more bandwidth for the kid 
<br>
to surf the net and spending several days going through *some* of the 
<br>
details of the clinic project with him and the elders.  The elders, 
<br>
understanding to some extent what they were getting, had insisted on paying 
<br>
with a beautiful piece of museum quality artwork, the most valuable 
<br>
possession the village had.  But it put the team behind schedule.
<br>
<p>(In fact, the kid understood far more about &quot;clinic seeds&quot; than Lothar and 
<br>
Mabo realized but did not share all he figured out with either them or the 
<br>
village elders.)
<br>
<p>Mabo nodded and checked the GPS.  They were off to pick up another seed and 
<br>
deliver it to the next tata down the valley.  They and thousands of other 
<br>
teams were moving in a wave down Africa leaving behind no village behind 
<br>
without a clinic seed.  It would take them another year to finish.
<br>
<p>******
<br>
<p>For the next two hours the seed concentrated on its &quot;root system&quot; pushing 
<br>
out self-assembling pipes and sniffing for water.  It was equipped to go 
<br>
down and out for hundreds of meters.  It hit water it could pump at 
<br>
9:30.   The seed pushed up its solar stalk and enlarged the collector first 
<br>
to 4 meters and then to 6.  By noon it had 40 kW of power available.  It 
<br>
was venting steam like a teakettle to get rid of the waste heat from its 
<br>
furious assembly projects.  One of these was a mesh microwave dish on top 
<br>
of the solar absorber.  (The dish weighed less than a silk handkerchief.)
<br>
<p>As soon as the seed finished the dish and (after consulting its clock, its 
<br>
GPS location and the place of the sun) it aligned the dish on the African 
<br>
net communication transponder attached to the geosynchronous ring and asked 
<br>
for a permanently assigned address on the net.  Up to that point the clinic 
<br>
seed was a generic product.  The address it was assigned was just a string 
<br>
of hexadecimal numbers but it was a *unique number*!  The clinic's 
<br>
personality was human in that it could feel smug about acquiring its *very 
<br>
own unique identification.*
<br>
