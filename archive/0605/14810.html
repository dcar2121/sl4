<p>Hmm....  If you feel like taking the time to give more detail on this,
<br>
it might be interesting.
<br>
<p>Maybe someone on the list will present a different angle on the
<br>
problem that will direct your thinking in a different (and useful)
<br>
direction... (hey, anything's possible ;-)
<br>
<p>Semi-relatedly, it's perhaps worth laying out how a reasonably
<br>
powerful probabilistic reasoning system (not necessarily a classical
<br>
Bayesian expected utility maximizer) would confront this problem.
<br>
<p>Presumably it would:
<br>
<p>a-- create an approximative model of itself internally
<br>
<p>b-- use this approximative model to carry out a series of hypothetical
<br>
inference trajectories of the form
<br>
&quot;If I modified myself into system Y_i, then these are the likely
<br>
outcomes that would ensue.&quot;
<br>
<p>c-- use the results of these inference trajectories to figure out how
<br>
it should modify itself
<br>
<p>Now, b and c are mathematically and conceptually though not
<br>
pragmatically straightforward...
<br>
<p>Regarding a,  presumably, given fixed space and time resources, the
<br>
system can search through the space of approximative models and choose
<br>
the one that seems to give rise to higher-confidence results....  Or
<br>
it could do scientific experiments using various methods of
<br>
approximative-model generation to predict the outcome of modifying
<br>
simpler systems...
<br>
<p>Presumably, a Bayesian expected utility maximizer would also end up
<br>
doing something very much like that I've described above ... but even
<br>
if so, proving this mathematically does not seem obvious, of
<br>
course....
