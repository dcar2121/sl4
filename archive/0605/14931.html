<p>
Is the human genome a self-referential program code?  Though I cannot seem
<br>
to find a good example URL, I recall reading about genomics researchers
<br>
identifying large sections of the the genome that do not appear to have any
<br>
particular function. It seems that the popular theory is that these
<br>
sequences once provided useful information and that they are now obsolete
<br>
yet have not been 'deleted.'   It would seem wasteful to leave the
<br>
equivalence of developer's comments in the source code (unless we're
<br>
currently running as un-optimized beta code)  It is generally observed that
<br>
Nature is highly efficient at managing energy/material resources.  So what
<br>
is the purpose of these apparently inactive sequences?
<br>
<p>As an analogy, consider the encoding of IP
<br>
datagrams&lt;<a href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPDatagramGeneralFormat.htm">http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPDatagramGeneralFormat.htm</a>&gt;.
<br>
There is a very specific preamble &quot;header&quot; preceding the data &quot;payload&quot;
<br>
Typically the infrastructure equipment between two endpoints
<br>
(routers/switches) only considers the header portion of the datagram.  That
<br>
is all that is required to process the packet at the network level.  The
<br>
payload portion is of no concern to intermediate devices.  The target
<br>
computer will pass the contents of this payload to the application that is
<br>
expected to correctly handle the data.  If we were to discover this
<br>
encoding, rather than create it - what context would we use to understand
<br>
the syntax?  That is, across the universe of IPv4 datagrams there is a
<br>
standard for the meaning of the data encoded in the header section.  A
<br>
similar header encoding standard might exist in DNA.   The IPv4 payload has
<br>
no standard, and is unique to the application to which the datagram is
<br>
intended.  It is also possible that the application itself is using variable
<br>
data, so there would be no Rosetta Stone by which to decode that payload.
<br>
(Even assuming there is no SSL or other encryption in effect)
<br>
<p>Is it plausible that these &quot;unknown format&quot; sequences could be instructions
<br>
that are parsed above the biomechanical level?  Could there be a &quot;rendering
<br>
agent&quot; that is acting on the aggregate of these sequences?  Are we looking
<br>
at the Bits of DNA looking for Bytes and missing the Words?  Could these
<br>
sequences be Turing rules for how to rewrite the tape containing the rules?
<br>
If the currently understood mechanics of DNA are the rules for manipulating
<br>
the substrate (biological nano replication) - is it possible these unknown
<br>
sequences encode either the sourcecode of the software on the substrate or
<br>
the current working memory (RAM) of the running program itself?
<br>
<p>BTW, if this line of thought is off-topic for the SL4 list, please respond
<br>
to me directly with any additional thoughts or feedback you might have.
