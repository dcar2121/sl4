<em>&gt; Is the human genome a self-referential program code?  Though I cannot seem

</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular function.
</em><br>
<p>After the publication of the final draft of the human genome, we know
<br>
that 1.2% of the sequence is protein-coding.  Up to 20% may have some
<br>
influence of the product phenotype, for various reasons.  45% is
<br>
repetitive, meaning that our genome has been expanded (almost doubled)
<br>
by a bunch of parasitic genetic elements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems that the popular theory is that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequences once provided useful information and that they are now obsolete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet have not been 'deleted.'
</em><br>
<p>Probably the opposite.  While we once thought that no non-coding DNA
<br>
is functional, we have discovered that microRNAs play an important
<br>
role in gene regulation.  Do a Google Scholar or PubMed search on
<br>
microRNA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would seem wasteful to leave the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalence of developer's comments in the source code (unless we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently running as un-optimized beta code)
</em><br>
<p>The developer is evolution, and evolution doesn't care.  Bad analogy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It is generally observed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature is highly efficient at managing energy/material resources.
</em><br>
<p>Evolution is blind, so biological systems are a mosaic of highly
<br>
optimized and highly inefficient subsystems, all depending on
<br>
available selection pressures and past constraints.  Exactly what we
<br>
would expect from a process without foresight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what is the purpose of these apparently inactive sequences?
</em><br>
<p>Like I said, up to 20% may have a role in gene regulation or something
<br>
else, then there's the fact that almost half is parasitic DNA.  In
<br>
your software developer analogy, think of it as a second, third and
<br>
fourth programmer coming in and altering your code, and no
<br>
communication between you.  In fact, everybody has a different goal
<br>
for the program in mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Is it plausible that these &quot;unknown format&quot; sequences could be instructions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are parsed above the biomechanical level?
</em><br>
<p>Some of them are parsed above the genomic level. Cf. alternative
<br>
splicing, protein folding chaperones, transcription/translation
<br>
regulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could there be a &quot;rendering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent&quot; that is acting on the aggregate of these sequences?  Are we looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the Bits of DNA looking for Bytes and missing the Words?  Could these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequences be Turing rules for how to rewrite the tape containing the rules?
</em><br>
<p>No, no, no and no.  When you take the computer analogy too far, your
<br>
constrain your ability to understand the system.  The genetic code is
<br>
/like/ a program to one extent or another, and carries information
<br>
kind of /like/ computer hardware does, but they are profoundly
<br>
different in some ways.
