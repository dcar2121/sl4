...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Singularity Summit should include all points of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In fairness to the organizers, I would note that it is a brief event
<br>
and all possible points of view cannot possibly be represented within
<br>
such a brief period of time.
<br>
<p>As an aside, I certainly would have liked to be invited to speak
<br>
regarding the implication of AGI for the Singularity, but I understand
<br>
that they simply had a very small number of speaking slots: it's a
<br>
one-day conference.....
<br>
<p>I agree that if they have a series of similar events, then in time one
<br>
of them should include someone advocating government regulation of
<br>
intelligent machines, as this is a meaningful viewpoint deserving to
<br>
be heard.   I don't agree that this issue is sooooo high-priority that
<br>
leaving it out of this initial one-day event is a big problem...
