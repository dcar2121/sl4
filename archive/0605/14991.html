<em>&gt;&gt; - If future god comes about via AGI, then a good portion of you bunch are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; its direct progenitors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why? Sorry, I didn't get that one. Also, why only &quot;a good portion&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>The SL4 list seems to be as good a forum for hearing what AGI
<br>
developers are thinking as any. I guess the hope is that the
<br>
back-and-forth on this list is actually contributing to the forward
<br>
momentum of (friendly) AGI emergence. Hopefully it isn't just
<br>
distracting otherwise crucial AGI architects from the work of getting
<br>
things done - I guess the ones who do get sidetracked would be the
<br>
&quot;other portion&quot; ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; - Free will: if you've got it, then you probably don't matter in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; future-god/agi terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why? Couldn't I be simultaneously the cause and the effect of a future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agi which would affect the past?
</em><br>
I guess in a many worlds scenario a future-god using you for effect
<br>
would mean it constructing a differing resultant future of note.  this
<br>
comes back to:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; - Future god isn't going to mess with it's own historical light cone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why not?
</em><br>
Where FG isn't going to unravel it's own resultant future by undoing
<br>
anything in it's &quot;critical path&quot; - crux events that must occur in a
<br>
given sequence or pattern to arrive at its emergence (or
<br>
transcendence, if you will). If a FG-precursory crux event involves
<br>
you getting squished by a bus in all possible universes, then, well,
<br>
*splat*.
<br>
<p>Either way the &quot;simultaneous cause and the effect&quot; circular reference
<br>
is a cogent point, helping to dismiss the while god is/was/will-be
<br>
question as moot and not something that will bear fruit from further
<br>
consideration... definitely a result I'm happy with.  The populist in
<br>
me thinks it could be a great little recruiter though...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The physics are there to potentially permit limited free-will
</em><br>
(defined as: a brain selecting or &gt;originating history lines based
<br>
upon abstract imagination of a desired future)
<br>
Imagination feels like it is such a core concept, both in the
<br>
deterministic-vs-dice physics arguments and the encapusulation of
<br>
conciousness into an AGI. The myriad, seemingly  pointless,
<br>
scenes+scenarios+schemas which go through a persons head have an
<br>
amazing richness. I love having someone who has just awoken descibe
<br>
their dreams to me - they are so often an amazing tapestry woven into
<br>
incredible uniqueness before being forgotten forever -  little
<br>
universes expnaded from nothing and then returned to the void. I both
<br>
cringe when thinking of trying to code the framework underlying
<br>
imagination and revel in it when questioning my own 'free will'.
<br>
<p>One way to view block-time/many-worlds in all this is maybe that there
<br>
are blocks of spacetime which bound eachother with myriad vertices and
<br>
edges composed of these 'crux' points - things which are just plain
<br>
going-to-happen in an unavoidable, deterministic manner. But within
<br>
these polygonal 'blocks' are 'free' areas of many-worlds spacetime
<br>
where a given route to a block-ending crux is open to alternate paths
<br>
in a morass of possible events. The universe doesn't really care
<br>
whether you dreamed of jolie or aniston, ate eggs or toast, took the
<br>
bus or the subway. But it does care that you were in the hallway at
<br>
15:09:34 and 8/29ths of a second when a convergent spacetime point of
<br>
value was resolved and you stepped on a cute co-workers foot.
<br>
<p>And I guess 'crux' points could come with a probability. AGI could be
<br>
likely, FG maybe not so - probability would be tied to the range of
<br>
the forecast and the complexity or uniqueness of lead-up events
<br>
required.
<br>
<p>Certain events would have a 'weight' to them, a gravity related to
<br>
their significance creating a momentum of converging precursors
<br>
leading to a little mini-singularity of 'rightness' as the universe
<br>
has a little orgasm of reality-expression. I guess the big bang would
<br>
truly be multi-orgasmic under this scenario :-)
