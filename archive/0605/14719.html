Charles:  Good points about the flywheel.  Sounds like it would be a bit
<br>
more complex than I thought...

Flywheels depend on being heavy AND on fast rotation to store energy. 
<br>
Also, they are merely a store, not a primary source.  (Well, primary source
<br>
is a bit vague...but gas is rather easy to add and fairly energy dense given
<br>
an oxygen atmosphere.)  So you can't use flywheels + electric unless you can
<br>
recharge the things fairly often.  I've heard of some electric buses that
<br>
made effective use of them...but they could frequently connect to overhead
<br>
wires, and only used the flywheels when stepping from area to area.
<br>
Improved batteries may have made them obsolete.
<br>
<p>I can accept that a flywheel can hold as much energy as a tank of gas...tell
<br>
me it's weight (and mass distribution) and the amount of energy it needs to
<br>
hold and I'll tell you how fast it needs to spin. 
<br>
For anything very large you'll need to manage frictionless rotation. (I
<br>
suggest magnetic levitation in a vacuum as the easiest method to achieve
<br>
this.)  Then you'll need to devise some way to transfer momentum from the
<br>
flywheel to the powertrain.  A magnetic link is probably the only feasible
<br>
way, though perhaps something based on static electricity could be made to
<br>
work...unless that were better used for the levitation.  At some point the
<br>
flywheel will need to be spun-up to speed...here's that magnetic coupling
<br>
again (think electric motor).  If you spin faster than a certain amount, the
<br>
flywheel will disintegrate.  This whole thing sounds like a bear to design
<br>
for durability, remember that roads tend to have bumps in them.  Now
<br>
consider what will happen if the road tips...OK.  Gyroscopic bearings are
<br>
needed, so that it can stay in alignment (a flywheel IS a gyroscope), and
<br>
the case needs room to turn (well, to stay stable while the vehicle turns).
<br>
<p>To me flywheels sound like a &quot;best choice&quot; only for certain specialized
<br>
circumstances.  I'm no mechanical engineer, so I could easily be wrong, but
<br>
I haven't been surprised by the limited success such vehicles have had.
