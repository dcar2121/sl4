Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I just watched your talk about recursion, the most important math problem 
<br>
and you mentioned changing value system as one of those problems that you 
<br>
have not yet been able to formulate and solve. I have some ideas, though 
<br>
not rigorously in math form, which I hope might help. Or you might already 
<br>
know all of these, but here goes anyways. Two different approaches, first 
<br>
one tells you when you possibly should change your value/goal system and 
<br>
the second one tells you how that should be aproached.
<br>
<p>I use the term moral system as a system which describes the goals and 
<br>
values, as well as the effect of values to the means of an agent. The 
<br>
reason for is that a value system as such is basically uncritisizable 
<br>
(Hume's Guillotine) and instead one should take both goals and means as a 
<br>
whole system and allow that to be critizised and improved.
<br>
<p>First important thing to understand is that a moral system is necessarily 
<br>
composed of both values/goals and the means used to get to them. Which 
<br>
means that a rational agent can look at his moral system, whenever he 
<br>
learns new information and find out that for example his system is 
<br>
self-defeating (which would be a bad thing).
<br>
<p>This kind of situation requires the agent to search for a better moral 
<br>
system, which can either mean changing goals, values, or means.
<br>
<p><p>The next step: how should we change our goals or values, because as you 
<br>
say, we get into an infinite recursion problem by doing that. The main 
<br>
idea in my opinion, is that the agent should calculate the future value of 
<br>
the future agents actions based on its _current_ values and goals. Thus, I 
<br>
will only make such changes to my code, which result in actions and in a 
<br>
mind which I, the current me, believes to maximize his own utility (not 
<br>
the utility of the future mind doing the actual decisions).
<br>
<p><p>One of the key things about utility theory is that utilities of two 
<br>
different minds cannot be directly compared. When we are doing 
<br>
modifications to our goal/value structure, we are changing the mind and 
<br>
thus the utilities of the future mind and current self cannot be directly 
<br>
compared. The future mind's utility can only be part of the equation, if 
<br>
the current mind cares about the future mind's utility.
<br>
<p>Does this kind of reasoning help solve the problem of infinite recursion 
<br>
you were talking about? The current mind makes decisions that maximize its 
<br>
utility, even though it will never as such see the results of that 
<br>
maximizing. Instead it is somebody else, the future mind, who does.
<br>
