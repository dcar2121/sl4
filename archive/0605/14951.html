<em>&gt; the strength of the compassion was slightly attenuated it didn't matter
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; strengthen the tribe, so everyone is more likely to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Xenophobia, in a mild form, is useful to split the tribe into groups

</em><br>
<p>I think you might have this backwards.  Evolved traits are a result of
<br>
adaptation rather than drivers of &quot;useful&quot; change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'd be really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised if it turned out that they often fought seriously before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invention of the arrow, or possibly the spear-thrower, and by that time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we were pretty much evolved into modern form.
</em><br>
<p>Why would you be surprised?  Are you following the &quot;noble savage&quot; line
<br>
of thought?  Biological evolution is demonstrably &quot;bloody in tooth and
<br>
claw&quot; and it is only recently that a  higher level of organization
<br>
offers hope (from the human viewpoint) for this to improve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, this doesn't appear to me to relate significantly to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instincts that we should create for the AI that we build.  It might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wise to have it be wary of strangers, but one would definitely want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put limits on how strong that reaction could be...and remember, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instincts need to be designed to operate on a system without a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictable sensoria.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think an AI would lack &quot;a predictable sensoria&quot;?  Are you
<br>
saying something like &quot;we can't know the qualia of an AI&quot;?  If that's
<br>
the case, we would have to veer off into the whole ugly discussion of
<br>
what people think they mean by qualia.  On the other hand, don't
<br>
designed systems have better defined sensoria than non-designed
<br>
systems?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You can probably predict that it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensitive to OS calls, unless you intend to have it operate on the bare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware.  Say you can guarantee that it lives in a POSIX compliant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe (or one close to that).  It may have USB or firewire cameras
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installed, it may not.  It can probably depend on at least intermittent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet access.
</em><br>
<p>Why would any application necessarily be aware of its operating
<br>
system?  Are humans necessarily aware of their supporting subsystems?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only shape for an instinct for friendliness that has occurred to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;Attempt to talk to those who attempt to talk with you.&quot;  I.e., learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the handshaking protocols of your environment.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is indeed touching upon a fundamental principle for
<br>
success.  All the interesting stuff (the potential for growth) is in
<br>
the interactions between Self and Other, the adjacent possible.
<br>
However this principle is just as applicable for offense as it is for
<br>
&quot;friendliness&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's a start.  Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only that, but it can be useful for dealing with disk drives and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet sites as well as with people.  I can't even think of how one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could say &quot;don't impose your will on an unwilling sentient&quot; at the level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of instincts.  That's got too many undefinable terms in it.  &quot;impose&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;will&quot;, &quot;sentient&quot;.  With enough effort I can vaguely see how will could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be defined...nothing that's jelled yet.
</em><br>
<p>This is a point where many people get stuck with conventional ideas of
<br>
morality.  A full explanation is not possible within the confines of
<br>
this email discussion, but moral decision-making *requires* that you
<br>
attempt to impose your will at every opportunity, but that will should
<br>
be as well informed as possible of the long-term consequences of its
<br>
actions.  The degree of sentience of the Other is irrelevant to this
<br>
basic principle, but very relevant to the actual interaction.
