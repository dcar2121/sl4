<p>
By the time the long dry season came back the tata inhabitants were used to 
<br>
the clinic.
<br>
<p>December 2042
<br>
<p>Far away, Lothar, Mabo and their fellow teams had completed planting 
<br>
clinics all the way to Cape Horn. There were just short of a million of 
<br>
them, one for every 350 inhabitants on the ravaged continent.  The planting 
<br>
went faster in the decimated cities; sometimes a crew could plant two or 
<br>
even three clinics in a day though security was more of a problem.   After 
<br>
finishing Africa, Lothar and Mabo had a choice planting clinic seeds in 
<br>
South America, New Guinea or Australia.  Vacations were not considered 
<br>
since the Foundation's goal was to provide clinics seeds to every human 
<br>
group on earth before the end of 2044.  In the opinion of the &quot;clinic seed&quot; 
<br>
planters, there was no more rewarding work on earth.
<br>
<p>May 2043
<br>
<p>Early in the second wet season Suskulan received a major system 
<br>
upgrade.    The upgrade went swiftly because Suskulan had stockpiled tens 
<br>
of thousands of liters of parts and fuel--most of it in the form of methyl 
<br>
alcohol--that he also was keeping in stock to be converted to fat if needed.
<br>
<p>Suskulan's first serious patient after the upgrade was Zaba, a 12 year old 
<br>
who had been shot through her spine while working in a garden.  She was 
<br>
near death, and far beyond help by pre clinic standards, when she was 
<br>
placed in Suskulan's &quot;hands.&quot;
<br>
<p>As the nanotech mist enveloped her still body, Suskulan told her parents:
<br>
<p>&quot;I can heal Zaba but it will take at least a week, perhaps as many as ten 
<br>
days.  You can talk to her this time tomorrow.&quot;
<br>
<p>This time the nanomachines didn't infiltrate her brain just to shut it 
<br>
down, though they did that and reversed the mild damage from shock and low 
<br>
blood flow.   The nanomachines mapped out all her neural circuits and cell 
<br>
connections.  Shortly before her parents entered the clinic the next day 
<br>
they tentatively restored consciousness, partly in her brain--which was far 
<br>
below the temperature needed to run on its own--and partly in the haze of 
<br>
nanomachines that were also simulating input in place of her eyes and ears.
<br>
<p>&quot;What happened to me?  Where am I?  Where is my body?&quot; Zaba asked as she 
<br>
became conscious.  She was calm because the nanomachines were acting as 
<br>
tranquilizers.  Suskulan was listening to an interface to her mostly 
<br>
simulated motor cortex.
<br>
<p>Suskulan imposed a wire frame image of the human form he usually presented 
<br>
on her visual cortex (to give Zaba orientation) then explained:
<br>
<p>&quot;You were shot, you are in the clinic Suskulan at the tata, and your body 
<br>
is being repaired.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The clinic recently gained new powers to speak to spirits while their 
<br>
bodies are being repaired.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The repair will take some time, even I do not know exactly how many days,&quot; 
<br>
he said.  &quot;You were badly injured.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;My mother and father,&quot; Zaba started and then stopped.
<br>
<p>&quot;They brought you to me and are very concerned.  I can extend my power and 
<br>
let you use it to talk to them as if you were speaking through a telephone.&quot;
<br>
<p>Zaba had never used a telephone, the tata being well out of range of a cell 
<br>
tower but she knew what they were like.  Suskulan's wire frame image handed 
<br>
Zaba a cell phone image.  She reached out with her wire frame body and took 
<br>
it from him just as Zaba's mother picked up a phone appearing object from 
<br>
the table.
<br>
<p>&quot;Zaba?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Mother!&quot;
<br>
<p>Suskulan had moved Zaba's body underground for better cooling and shorter 
<br>
connections to the mass of repair devices.  The Zaba on the table was solid 
<br>
image of utility fog.  Suskulan was still wiring up the image body so Zaba 
<br>
could not feel her mother holding the warm hand of the image.  Though 
<br>
Zaba's skin had been repaired in hours, the image showed a healing but 
<br>
still somewhat raw looking entry wound.
<br>
<p>&quot;Are you going to be all right Zaba?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Suskulan says I will be, but he doesn't know how many days it will 
<br>
take.  Can you get Tanko to finish weeding?
<br>
<p>&quot;I will do it myself.&quot;  Her mother said.  She did not want to risk her 
<br>
other daughter.  After an hour of visiting Zaba's mother and father left 
<br>
promising to come back the next day.
<br>
<p>When they left, Suskulan offered to let her sleep till the next day, but 
<br>
Zaba was curious about what had happened to her.
<br>
<p>&quot;Who shot me?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That I do not know.  However, the bullet fragments can be matched with the 
<br>
gun if someone else is shot or the gun is found.  It was an AK-47 or 
<br>
similar.  The bullet went through your spine.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sensing that she wanted to know more, Suskulan generated a wire frame of 
<br>
her body and fed it to her visual circuits.
<br>
<p>&quot;The bullet entered the outer edge of your right nipple between ribs, 
<br>
passed through your right lung just missing your heart.  It hit the 4th 
<br>
thoracic vertebrae, shattering it and severing your spinal cord.&quot;  Since 
<br>
butchering animals was a common (but not common enough!) practice at the 
<br>
tata Zaba understood the picture she was seeing.
<br>
<p>&quot;That takes a lot of fixing.  Your body is being kept very cold so my 
<br>
healing spirits can work fast without burning up.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;How do they work?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Ah.  Such a simple question; such a *hard* answer.   The problem is you 
<br>
don't have the words; they don't exist in your language.  To understand how 
<br>
healing spirits work would require that you learn to read and learn another 
<br>
language.&quot;
<br>
<p>Zaba, like 99% of the Tamberna, was illiterate.   Not that learning to read 
<br>
in her language would have been much help.  The only literature in the 
<br>
language was a translation of the Bible, not terribly useful to people with 
<br>
traditional religions.
<br>
<p>&quot;Can you teach me this language and how to read?&quot;  Zaba asked.
<br>
<p>There was a short pause, which was really a very long pause for Suskulan as 
<br>
he projected what would happen and the unstated (though obvious) reason he 
<br>
had been given the upgrade.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot; Suskulan said at last inflecting his voice to a sigh.  &quot;But it will 
<br>
change you and the rest of the people of the tata in ways you cannot 
<br>
foresee and may not like. You can sleep through the nine or ten days it 
<br>
will take to finish healing you.  Are you sure you want to do this?
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Zaba firmly, &quot;I want to learn.&quot;
<br>
<p>And thus was the fate of this particular tata determined, though in truth 
<br>
something like this had been ordained since Lothar and Mabo traded for a 
<br>
fetish the &quot;clinic seed,&quot; that became Suskulan and before that when the 
<br>
Foundation organized the distribution of clinic seeds, and before that when 
<br>
an early clinic design was released under a creative commons license, and 
<br>
before that . . . leading back and back in time to when proto humans first 
<br>
discovered that a broken stone's sharp edge was just the thing to get at 
<br>
the meat under a hide.
<br>
<p>Subjectively Zaba talked to her parents every ten days after that.  Instead 
<br>
of a phone, Suskulan animated her image on the healing table.  Zaba was 
<br>
able to feel her mother holding her image when she visited while her real 
<br>
body was near freezing and 30 meters under the tata.
<br>
<p>Her biological memory was being mechanically updated in her very cold brain 
<br>
and her consciousness was running in a swarm of fast nano 
<br>
computers.  Suskulan could have let her experience run even faster but he 
<br>
didn't want her to get too far out of synch with her family and the rest of 
<br>
the tata.
<br>
<p>Mechanically constructed memory is a very efficient way to learn.  With 
<br>
Suskulan's help Zaba learned to read her own language in a few hours, to be 
<br>
fluent in English in 15 days (subjective), to a eighth-grade equivalent 
<br>
education in 30 days and to a rough understanding of the physical and 
<br>
chemical background for nanotechnology by 60 days subjective.
<br>
<p>Toward the end of her stay in the clinic, Zaba had an understanding of what 
<br>
the swarms of repair devices were doing to restore her spinal cord, 
<br>
patiently teasing out where the nerves should be reconnected across the 
<br>
gap, replacing cell walls and myelin in the destroyed section, rebuilding 
<br>
the shattered bone, muscle and connective tissue and fishing out the bullet 
<br>
fragments down to single atoms of lead.  She even had some understanding of 
<br>
how her mind was being supported in the nano computers that were acting in 
<br>
place of her very cold brain.
<br>
<p>A few hours before her parents were to come on the last day, Zaba warmed up 
<br>
her body under Suskulan's guidance.  Her consciousness was continuous as 
<br>
the reactivated brain cells took over from the slowed down swarm of nano 
<br>
computers that had been simulating them.   The support and information 
<br>
umbilical connections withdrew and the holes in her skin closed seamlessly 
<br>
as Zaba started breathing for the first time in 9 days.
<br>
<p>She sat up and coughed a few times.  Her physical body was different from 
<br>
what she had experienced for the past subjective 90 
<br>
days.  Better?  Worse?  She could not decide.  Zaba was delighted that 
<br>
there was no sign she had been shot.  She walked around the huge 
<br>
underground space, which had become familiar to her in the past 3 months as 
<br>
she shifted her virtual viewpoint among clouds of &quot;utility fog.&quot;  Zaba 
<br>
detected a few misconnected sensation nerves in one foot.  Suskulan said if 
<br>
her brain did not adjust to them in a few days she should come back and the 
<br>
clinic would fix them.
<br>
<p>She was mildly distressed that she now had to voice talk to Suskulan, who 
<br>
appeared as a projection instead of &quot;talking&quot; directly to his spirit in the 
<br>
spirit world she had inhabited.  Then she realized from her new knowledge 
<br>
there was a way she could if she took a bit of the clinic with 
<br>
her.  However, there wasn't much time to before her parents came.
<br>
<p>&quot;Can I come back to visit even if I am not hurt?&quot; she asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes.  Anytime I don't have another patient.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Can I take the clinic's interface with me?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;There is nothing so addictive . . .&quot; thought Suskulan.
<br>
<p>&quot;You may.&quot;  Part of the cloud of nanomachines that had just left Zaba's 
<br>
brain returned as a momentary haze.  Since they retained their memory of 
<br>
where they had been it was a matter of a few minutes before the machines 
<br>
reestablished their monitoring posts in Zaba's brain.
<br>
<p>&quot;I missed not being able to talk to you in the spirit world.&quot;   Zaba said 
<br>
without voicing.  A wire frame image in Zaba's visual cortex overlaid the 
<br>
physical projected image of Suskulan.
<br>
<p>&quot;Spirit talk does not reach as far as your garden.&quot;  Suskulan warned her.
<br>
<p>Zaba lay down on the repair table that was now at the bottom of the 
<br>
elevator shaft.   The elevator lifted it into its place in the 
<br>
clinic.   Zaba was treated to seeing the rapidly thinning utility fog image 
<br>
of her body that had comforted her family for the last ten days before she 
<br>
merged into her image.
<br>
<p>The nanomachine haze that had fogged her image and now her real body 
<br>
withdrew into the low table.  Her family was seated on the floor waiting 
<br>
for her to awake.  She greeted her family and in voice talk said goodbye to 
<br>
the image of an old man Suskulan was projecting.  Then they stepped through 
<br>
the clinic's keyhole door to where the other members of the tata were 
<br>
waiting for a joyous celebration of the healing of Zaba.
