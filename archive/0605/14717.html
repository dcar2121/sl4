</em><br>
<em>&gt;

Flywheels depend on being heavy AND on fast rotation to store energy. 
<br>
Also, they are merely a store, not a primary source.  (Well, primary
<br>
source is a bit vague...but gas is rather easy to add and fairly energy
<br>
dense given an oxygen atmosphere.)  So you can't use flywheels +
<br>
electric unless you can recharge the things fairly often.  I've heard of
<br>
some electric buses that made effective use of them...but they could
<br>
frequently connect to overhead wires, and only used the flywheels when
<br>
stepping from area to area.  Improved batteries may have made them obsolete.
<br>
<p>I can accept that a flywheel can hold as much energy as a tank of
<br>
gas...tell me it's weight (and mass distribution) and the amount of
<br>
energy it needs to hold and I'll tell you how fast it needs to spin. 
<br>
For anything very large you'll need to manage frictionless rotation. (I
<br>
suggest magnetic levitation in a vacuum as the easiest method to achieve
<br>
this.)  Then you'll need to devise some way to transfer momentum from
<br>
the flywheel to the powertrain.  A magnetic link is probably the only
<br>
feasible way, though perhaps something based on static electricity could
<br>
be made to work...unless that were better used for the levitation.  At
<br>
some point the flywheel will need to be spun-up to speed...here's that
<br>
magnetic coupling again (think electric motor).  If you spin faster than
<br>
a certain amount, the flywheel will disintegrate.  This whole thing
<br>
sounds like a bear to design for durability, remember that roads tend to
<br>
have bumps in them.  Now consider what will happen if the road
<br>
tips...OK.  Gyroscopic bearings are needed, so that it can stay in
<br>
alignment (a flywheel IS a gyroscope), and the case needs room to turn
<br>
(well, to stay stable while the vehicle turns).
<br>
<p>To me flywheels sound like a &quot;best choice&quot; only for certain specialized
<br>
circumstances.  I'm no mechanical engineer, so I could easily be wrong,
<br>
but I haven't been surprised by the limited success such vehicles have had.
