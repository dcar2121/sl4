Michael:
<br>
Well, let's see if I can evaluate the past.  We saw explosive change in
<br>
airplanes in the early 1900s, from biplanes through jet airplanes.
<br>
Obviously, supersonic passenger planes would continue that exponential
<br>
progress, right?  Nope.  The SST was a bust, as was the Concorde.  We fly
<br>
today at about the same speed at the dawn of the Jet Age, 50 years ago.  Has
<br>
there been change in passenger aviation since the 50s?  Of course.  But the
<br>
exponential phase has closed.
<br>
<p>Look at skyscrapers -- 4x increase in record skyscraper height in the 40
<br>
years leading up to the Empire State Building in 1931.  Then no increase in
<br>
record height in the next 40 years.
<br>
<p>Look at the printing press -- explosive growth in the second half of the
<br>
1400s (10M new printed books).  Then the amount of change quieted for a few
<br>
centuries.  Then, more explosive change in the early 1800s, when steam
<br>
increased printing speeds 100x, giving us the penny newspaper.  And then
<br>
that, in turn, quieted down.
<br>
<p>Railroads -- exponential growth with track miles doubling every decade for 6
<br>
decades.  Not so anymore.  Telephone.  Electricity.  Cars and trucks.  They
<br>
all have their equivalent of a Moore's Law period, that lasts for a while,
<br>
and then it quiets down.
<br>
<p>Yes, today we have explosive growth in some areas of technology.  But we
<br>
don't in most of them.  It's been like that for 200 years.  That's why I say
<br>
that change has been (very roughly) constant since the Industrial
<br>
Revolution.

Subject: RE: Anti-singularity spam.
<br>
<p>Bob, you said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Do you think that progress will stop just for this generation?&quot;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly not.  However, I don't think progress is exponential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Kurweil's Law of Accelerating Returns, for example) since it never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been.  IMO, the rate of technological change in the West has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly constant since the Industrial Revolution.
</em><br>
<p>So, you say that progress has never been exponential.
<br>
Dani Eder mentioned the GDP and manufacturing productivity as an indication.
<br>
Even Moore's law has been going strong (or close enough).
<br>
There are many irefutable examples in Kurzweil's TSIN about exponential
<br>
trends from the past to the present.
<br>
OK, so noone can predict the future.
<br>
But you are incapable of evaluating the past.
<br>
<p>You also said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To respond to your earlier email, you said, &quot;If only the general 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populace understood how close we were and the potential of these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies. If only Bob. And you can define &quot;close&quot; as anything you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like.  Even a couple of centuries is close, though I see it as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of decades until the full bloom of the aforementioned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you define &quot;close&quot; as a couple of centuries, then I'm right with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I'm pessimistic about seeing the full bloom of AGI, nanotech, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on in just 20 years.
</em><br>
<p>Again you are sidestepping my main point. Which is that you are assuming
<br>
things about the perceptions of the general population.
<br>
Specifically, you said that the majority of the population percieves
<br>
nanotech and renewable energy(pressumably other techs as well) as current
<br>
technologies and so they think we are making much more progress than we are.
<br>
<p>Your definition of &quot;the majority of the population&quot;
<br>
must be really skewed.
<br>
Out of personal observation, the majority of the population leads a simple
<br>
life. Nanotech (in the sense of a MNfactory) is sci-fi for them, along with
<br>
AGI, moon bases and flying cars.
<br>
You are talking about a small part of the population that thrives on sci-fi
<br>
and enjoys future-hypes (your imediate social circle, maybe?).
<br>
<p>IMO you haven't demonstrated any ability to logically evaluate data and you
<br>
haven't presented any sources to compensate.
<br>
You've written a book though
