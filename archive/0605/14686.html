</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The majority of the population sees nanotechnology, renewable energy, AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even AI and biotech as sci-fi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If only the general populace understood how close we were and the potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these technologies. If only Bob. And you can define &quot;close&quot; as anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even a couple of centuries is close, though I see it as a couple of decades
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the full bloom of the aforementioned technologies. My point is that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the majority of the population&quot; understood, they would make it a top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priority and strive to make these technologies bloom as fast as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PC, internet, cellular phones. That's about it for the average Joe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;things to come&quot; haven't had an impact on every day life yet and so are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the realm of fantasy (like the PC, internet and cellular phones, when
</em><br>

You are confusing generalities with particulars.  Any prediction about
<br>
the specifics of how the future will develop justly deserves to have
<br>
scorn heaped upon it.  A prediction of the generality:  &quot;A new
<br>
technology will come along and sweep up unsuspecting into a future
<br>
that's different from what we have imagined.&quot; is a cinch.  The problems
<br>
lie at the interstices.
<br>
<p>That any specific prediction that you make will be wrong doesn't mean
<br>
that you shouldn't make predictions, it means you can't depend on the
<br>
details, and even then you must expect to be surprised.  When people
<br>
mention nanotech they are picking out a &quot;most likely winner&quot;.  It's not
<br>
inevitable, but we've got existence proofs all around us AND we've been
<br>
making rapid progress in that direction.  Even if we never actually get
<br>
to the &quot;diamond age&quot;, we'll get to something with some parts of it. 
<br>
(Personally I don't see any reason to doubt that we'll have
<br>
nanotechnology within 5 years...for a reasonable definition of
<br>
nanotech.  You could even argue that it's available now in a limited
<br>
form, and just too expensive,  for now, to bother with.)  As to whether
<br>
assemblers will ever be built...who knows?  There are good reasons to
<br>
avoid them, but if they don't appear, something similar will.  Something
<br>
which hasn't yet been predicted, or at least hasn't yet caught the
<br>
imagination.  Factories in a box, perhaps.  You could do that with
<br>
millimeter scale robots operated as telefactors by a specialized
<br>
computer that plugs into the side of the box.  This provides increased
<br>
security and less need to operate at the nanometer scale.  (Think of the
<br>
cornucopia boxes in Singularity Sky, and double or triple each linear
<br>
dimension.)  You pour stuff in the top and it produces the articles you
<br>
request.  How well would it work?  The current 3-D printers only produce
<br>
plastic...though I understand that now they can lay down traces of
<br>
electrically conductive plastic for electric circuits.  And they're
<br>
still hideously expensive, though the prices have come down and the
<br>
quality has gone up over the last decade.
<br>
<p>3D printers exist today, and they are already in commercial use for
<br>
special circumstances.  Because of this the conservative forecast will
<br>
have them developed along the lines of faster, cheaper, better quality,
<br>
more complete until they become more widely useful, at which time the
<br>
rate of development will speed up.  My personal expectation is that
<br>
their rate of development is sufficiently slow that something else will
<br>
overtake them.  It's likely, however, to be like daisy-wheel printers
<br>
giving was to lasers and ink-jets.  The end uses will see it as a
<br>
continuation of the same device, but under the hood it's something
<br>
totally different.
