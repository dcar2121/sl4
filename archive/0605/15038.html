If you make it attractive enough to such in 90% of the people, the
<br>
remaining 10% will be either incapable of or not interested in
<br>
maintaining a technological civilization.  I think we could lose 40% at
<br>
random without excessive problem, but those who volunteer for such a
<br>
system would not be &quot;at random&quot;.  This has been touched on by several SF
<br>
authors in various contexts, and with various degrees of care, in works
<br>
from &quot;The Care and Breeding of Pigs&quot; (forget the author, depopulation by
<br>
disease) to Vinge's &quot;The Peace War&quot; (or, as I remember it, &quot;The Bobble
<br>
War&quot;).    I suppose that &quot;When Worlds Collide/After Worlds Collide&quot;, by
<br>
Balmer, would also count though that's almost colonization rather than
<br>
depopulation.  Also consider &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by somebody Stewart, and
<br>
&quot;City&quot; by Clifford Simak.  Lots of various outcomes, depending on the
<br>
message they were trying to send as much as on the logical nature of the
<br>
situation.  But unanimous in that severe depopulation is extremely
<br>
stressful to a social system, and technical systems that aren't
<br>
self-maintaining are likely to disintegrate.
<br>
<p>Another extreme example is &quot;The Eden Cycle&quot; by R. Gallun.   Actually,
<br>
that's the one that closest to the scenario that you are describing. 
<br>
And his answer was that after a certain crucial percentage of the
<br>
population moved into virtual reality, the degradation of the social
<br>
environment would cause most of the rest to migrate also.  Particularly
<br>
since it would be there as a constant temptation for future generations,
<br>
so whenever things got tough, they was a way to escape them.  There are
<br>
a lot of good reasons that that book is worth reading and
<br>
contemplating.  Very few have put as much though into what virtual
<br>
reality would MEAN as he did...mean socially, not technically.  
<br>
Actually, I believe that the book predates almost all of the theoretical
<br>
work on virtual reality, and it still covers living there in more depth
<br>
that almost anyone else.   It is true, however, that he keeps having his
<br>
viewpoint characters revert to &quot;unenhanced&quot;.  OTOH, he makes it clear
<br>
that they are a small minority (i.e., two), so there's no implication
<br>
that everyone so reverted.  It's not high literary style, but it's
<br>
excellent futurism, even now it's high futurism, and it's decades old.
