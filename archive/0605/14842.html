<em>&gt; I am concerned that the Singularity Summit will not include

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Summit should include someone speaking in favor of it. Note
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; widespread public movement like the environmental and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumer safety movements. Intelligent weapons could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulated by treaties similar to those for nuclear, chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and biological weapons.
</em><br>
<p>We (meaning Ray Kurzweil) tried very hard to get Bill Joy, but he simply 
<br>
wasn't available for May 13.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The obvious choice to advocate this position would be James
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hughes, and it is puzzling that he is not included among the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speakers. Can anyone explain why he is not included?
</em><br>
<p>Stanford demanded a known, prominent Singularity skeptic - for their 
<br>
definitions of &quot;prominent&quot; and &quot;Singularity skeptic&quot;.  When we couldn't 
<br>
get Bill Joy, they gave us a list that included Bill McKibben, and 
<br>
McKibben was the first person we asked who was available.
<br>
<p>I confess that I didn't think of replacing Bill Joy with James Hughes to 
<br>
speak for the regulatory viewpoint, but the speaker schedule was already 
<br>
full at this point, and we only had one slot (the one that would have 
<br>
gone to Bill Joy) to fill with a Stanford-approved skeptic.  It is a 
<br>
fair suggestion, if we could do it all over from scratch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Singularity Summit should include all points of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view, including advocates for regulation of intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines. It will weaken the Summit to exclude this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of view.
</em><br>
<p>The organizers seem extremely Summit-fatigued at this point, but maybe 
<br>
we'll do another one someday... as it is, the speaker schedule is full 
<br>
up and it's too late for any changes.  The Summit represents a huge 
<br>
diversity of views.  *All points of view* is impossible.  But, yes, 
<br>
there were viewpoints we wanted from speakers we couldn't get.  Vinge 
<br>
wasn't available on May 13 either.

</em><br>
<p>Indeed.  Also, bear in mind that SIAI is only one organizer of the 
<br>
Summit; and that the goal was to fit in all the viewpoints, rather than 
<br>
all the people.  Ben Goertzel and Eliezer Yudkowsky may seem different 
<br>
if your accustomed environment is the SL4 mailing list, but from the 
<br>
Summit's perspective, we represent viewpoints that are clustered very 
<br>
close together in opinionspace.
