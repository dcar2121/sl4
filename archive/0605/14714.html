</em><br>
<p>Hold futurists accountable?  Sounds wonderful.  *Which futurists*?
<br>
<p>Futurism is commonly practiced as a form of entertainment, pure and 
<br>
simple.  It's storytelling about distant land called Future and the 
<br>
bizarre customs of its inhabitants, just as one might tell stories of Oz 
<br>
or Atlantis.  The story obeys the laws of dramatic unity, and has plenty 
<br>
of concrete detail, in accordance with the advice you will find in any 
<br>
book on fiction writing.  Like religion, popular futurism is &quot;minimally 
<br>
counterintuitive&quot; in the sense that it violates one or two expectations, 
<br>
just enough to be startling and memorable, while obeying all other 
<br>
expectations.
<br>
<p>Of course they get it wrong.  Why in the world would you expect popular 
<br>
futurism to be right?  It is like making a list of failed predictions 
<br>
from the Lensman novels.  Popular futurism has no connection to reality. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It has rules, but only the rules of the storyteller.  The dates 
<br>
consist of people pulling random numbers out of their butt to support 
<br>
the demands of the story.  Futurism as commonly practiced is part of the 
<br>
media-entertainment complex, not science.  The fact that few people 
<br>
bother to keep tabs on the accuracy of past predictions tells you this 
<br>
instantly - imagine scientists publishing theories and no one bothering 
<br>
to check on the experimental results.
<br>
<p>I realize this point is not widely appreciated, but to draw an accurate 
<br>
map of a city, you must walk through the city and make lines on paper 
<br>
that correspond to what you see.  Sitting in your apartment drawing 
<br>
fascinating worlds isn't going to work.  If you make stuff up at random 
<br>
and it turns out not to correspond to reality, that is not very 
<br>
surprising once you think about it.
<br>
<p>There are people in this world who learn other rules than the rules that 
<br>
storytellers know.  (For an introduction to these rules, I recommend 
<br>
Robyn Dawes's &quot;Rational Choice in an Uncertain World&quot;.  He has some 
<br>
choice words to say about overestimating predictability.)  There are 
<br>
people who focus as much on common fallacies and reproducible biases as 
<br>
storytellers focus on vivid details.  When a careful rationalist dares 
<br>
to say something about the future - and the daring part is not the 
<br>
amazing startling prediction, but claiming that whatever-it-is is 
<br>
predictable in the first place - then that is discussed and criticized 
<br>
under different rules.
<br>
<p>If someone makes a startling prediction in a newspaper, and there's no 
<br>
carefully developed supporting argument for why whatever-it-is is even 
<br>
predictable in the first place - then why is it *interesting* that 
<br>
they're wrong?  What else would you expect?  Next you'll be telling us 
<br>
that astrology doesn't work at better than the chance level.
