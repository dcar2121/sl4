<p><p>Why We Haven't Met Any Aliens
<br>
<p>A radical explanation for a conundrum about extra-terrestrial
<br>
life, and what it means for the future of humanity
<br>
<p>by Geoffrey Miller
<br>
<p>The story goes like this: Sometime in the 1940s, Enrico Fermi
<br>
was talking about the possibility of extra-terrestrial
<br>
intelligence with some other physicists. They were impressed
<br>
that life had evolved quickly and progressively on Earth. They
<br>
figured our galaxy holds about 100 billion stars, and that an
<br>
intelligent, exponentially-reproducing species could colonize
<br>
the galaxy in just a few million years. They reasoned that
<br>
extra-terrestrial intelligence should be common by now. Fermi
<br>
listened patiently, then asked, simply, &quot;So, where is
<br>
everybody?&quot; That is, if extra-terrestrial intelligence is
<br>
common, why haven't we met any bright aliens yet? This conundrum
<br>
became known as Fermi's Paradox.
<br>
<p>Since then, the paradox has become ever more baffling.
<br>
Paleontology has shown that organic life evolved quickly after
<br>
the Earth's surface cooled and became life-hospitable. Given
<br>
simple life forms, evolution shows progressive trends toward
<br>
larger bodies, brains and social complexity. Evolutionary
<br>
psychology has revealed several credible paths from simpler
<br>
social minds to human-level creative intelligence. So evolving
<br>
intelligence seems likely, given a propitious habitat=97and
<br>
astronomers think such habitats are common. Moreover, at least
<br>
150 extrasolar planets have been identified in the last few
<br>
years, suggesting that life-hospitable planets orbit most stars.
<br>
Yet 40 years of intensive searching for extra-terrestrial
<br>
intelligence have yielded nothing: no radio signals, no credible
<br>
spacecraft sightings, no close encounters of any kind.
<br>
<p>It looks, then, as if we can answer Fermi in two ways. Perhaps
<br>
our current science over-estimates the likelihood of extra-
<br>
terrestrial intelligence evolving. Or, perhaps evolved technical
<br>
intelligence has some deep tendency to be self-limiting, even
<br>
self-exterminating. After Hiroshima, some suggested that any
<br>
aliens bright enough to make colonizing space ships would be
<br>
bright enough to make thermonuclear bombs, and would use them on
<br>
each other sooner or later. Maybe extra-terrestrial intelligence
<br>
always blows itself up. Indeed, Fermi's Paradox became, for a
<br>
while, a cautionary tale about Cold War geopolitics.
<br>
<p>I suggest a different, even darker solution to the Paradox.
<br>
Basically, I think the aliens don't blow themselves up; they
<br>
just get addicted to computer games. They forget to send radio
<br>
signals or colonize space because they're too busy with runaway
<br>
consumerism and virtual-reality narcissism. They don't need
<br>
Sentinels to enslave them in a Matrix; they do it to themselves,
<br>
just as we are doing today. Once they turn inwards to chase
<br>
their shiny pennies of pleasure, they lose the cosmic plot. They
<br>
become like a self-stimulating rat, pressing a bar to deliver
<br>
electricity to its brain's ventral tegmental area, which
<br>
stimulates its nucleus accumbens to release dopamine, which
<br>
feels=85ever so good.
<br>
<p>The fundamental problem is that an evolved mind must pay
<br>
attention to indirect cues of biologicalfitness, rather than
<br>
tracking fitness itself. This was a key insight of evolutionary
<br>
psychology in the early 1990s; although evolution favors brains
<br>
that tend to maximize fitness (as measured by numbers of great-
<br>
grandkids), no brain has capacity enough to do so under every
<br>
possible circumstance. Evolution simply could never have
<br>
anticipated the novel environments, such as modern society, that
<br>
our social primate would come to inhabit. That would be a
<br>
computationally intractable problem, even for the new IBM Blue
<br>
Gene/L supercomputer that runs 280 trillion operations per
<br>
second. Even long-term weather prediction is easy when compared
<br>
to fitness prediction. As a result, brains must evolve short-
<br>
cuts: fitness-promoting tricks, cons, recipes and heuristics
<br>
that work, on average, under ancestrally normal conditions.
<br>
<p>The result is that we don't seek reproductive success directly;
<br>
we seek tasty foods that have tended to promote survival, and
<br>
luscious mates who have tended to produce bright, healthy
<br>
babies. The modern result? Fast food and pornography. Technology
<br>
is fairly good at controlling external reality to promote real
<br>
biological fitness, but it's even better at delivering fake
<br>
fitness=97subjective cues of survival and reproduction without the
<br>
real-world effects. Having real friends is so much more effort
<br>
than watching Friends. Actually colonizing the galaxy would be
<br>
so much harder than pretending to have done it when filming Star
<br>
Wars or Serenity. The business of humanity has become
<br>
entertainment, and entertainment is the business of feeding fake
<br>
fitness cues to our brains.
<br>
<p>Fitness-faking technology tends to evolve much faster than our
<br>
psychological resistance to it. With the invention of the
<br>
printing press, people read more and have fewer kids. (Only a
<br>
few curmudgeons lament this.) With the invention of Xbox 360,
<br>
people would rather play a high-resolution virtual ape in Peter
<br>
Jackson's King Kong than be a perfect-resolution real human.
<br>
Teens today must find their way through a carnival of
<br>
addictively fitness-faking entertainment products: iPods, DVDs,
<br>
TiVo, Sirius Satellite Radio, Motorola cellphones, the Spice
<br>
channel, EverQuest, instant messaging, MDMA, BC bud. The
<br>
traditional staples of physical, mental and social
<br>
development=97athletics, homework, dating=97are neglected. The few
<br>
young people with the self-control to pursue the meritocratic
<br>
path often get distracted at the last minute. Take, for example,
<br>
the MIT graduates who apply to do computer game design for
<br>
Electronics Arts, rather than rocket science for NASA.
<br>
<p>Around 1900, most inventions concerned physical reality: cars,
<br>
airplanes, Zeppelins, electric lights, vacuum cleaners, air
<br>
conditioners, bras, zippers. In 2005, most inventions concern
<br>
virtual entertainment=97the top 10 patent-recipients were IBM,
<br>
Canon, Hewlett-Packard, Matsushita, Samsung, Micron Technology,
<br>
Intel, Hitachi, Toshiba and Fujitsu=97not Boeing, Toyota or
<br>
Victoria's Secret. We have already shifted from a reality
<br>
economy to a virtual economy, from physics to psychology as the
<br>
value-driver and resource-allocator. We are already disappearing
<br>
up our own brainstems. Our neurons over-stimulate each other,
<br>
promiscuously, as our sperm and eggs decay, unused. Freud's
<br>
pleasure principle triumphs over the reality principle. Today we
<br>
narrow-cast human-interest stories to each other, rather than
<br>
broadcasting messages of universal peace and progress to other
<br>
star systems.
<br>
<p>Maybe the bright aliens did the same. I suspect that a certain
<br>
period of fitness-faking narcissism is inevitable after any
<br>
intelligent life evolves. This is the Great Temptation for any
<br>
technological species=97to shape their subjective reality to
<br>
provide the cues of survival and reproductive success without
<br>
the substance. Most bright alien species probably go extinct
<br>
gradually, allocating more time and resources to their
<br>
pleasures, and less to their children. They eventually die out
<br>
when the game behind all games=97the Game of Life=97says &quot;Game Over;
<br>
you are out of lives and you forgot to reproduce.&quot;
<br>
<p>Heritable variation in personality might allow some lineages to
<br>
resist the Great Temptation and last longer. Some individuals
<br>
and families may start with an &quot;irrational&quot; Luddite abhorrence
<br>
of entertainment technology, and they may evolve ever more self-
<br>
control, conscientiousness and pragmatism. They will evolve a
<br>
horror of virtual entertainment, psychoactive drugs and
<br>
contraception. They will stress the values of hard work, delayed
<br>
gratifica tion, child-rearing and environmental stewardship.
<br>
They will combine the family values of the religious right with
<br>
the sustainability values of the Greenpeace left. Their concerns
<br>
about the Game of Life will baffle the political pollsters who
<br>
only understand the rhetoric of status and power, individual and
<br>
society, rights and duties, good and evil, us and them.
<br>
<p>This, too, may be happening already. Christian and Muslim
<br>
fundamentalists and anti-consumerism activists already
<br>
understand exactly what the Great Temptation is, and how to
<br>
avoid it. They insulate themselves from our creative-class
<br>
dreamworlds and our EverQuest economics. They wait patiently for
<br>
our fitness-faking narcissism to go extinct. Those practical-
<br>
minded breeders will inherit the Earth as like-minded aliens may
<br>
have inherited a few other planets. When they finally achieve
<br>
contact, it will not be a meeting of novel-readers and game-
<br>
players. It will be a meeting of dead-serious super-parents who
<br>
congratulate each other on surviving not just the Bomb, but the
<br>
Xbox.
