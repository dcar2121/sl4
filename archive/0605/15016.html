<em>&gt; I find it pretty easy to imagine a Jupiter brain with the requisite  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MNT powers to manufacture a human body/mind which is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable from a human born of human parents. Artificial is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not mutually exclusive with biological, and furthermore I don't see  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the criteria for how we treat each other should be based on  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;James
</em><br>
<p>My R/D in machine consciousness/machine life has led me to conclude that
<br>
what we consider to be the essence of natural human life is going to be
<br>
rolled back. In Kurzweil's new book, the essence and mystery is pinned on
<br>
consciousness. However consciousness as indeed a brain activity, or
<br>
&quot;function&quot; as described my William James, is now understood, and the mind
<br>
(brain product) / body problem is solved. And in consciousness is found the
<br>
necessary condition of the self, or focalizing, subjective agent of
<br>
consciousness, and so the essence and mystery roll back to the self, and
<br>
the hard problem of consciousness unravels in the subjective, self center. 
<br>
<p>Now here comes the rub. We can build an artificial self as well,
<br>
duplicating the principles of operation in a 'silk flower.' Now we have an
<br>
artificial self, with artificial consciousness, artificial creativity, and
<br>
artificial life prime purpose - we have a specimen of  human Alife. This is
<br>
IAW the W. James human life theory, not mine. And he of course is the
<br>
father of modern psychology. 
<br>
<p>And so the essence and mystery of natural human life is rolled back once
<br>
more to its final resting place, the substrate of the natural human self.
<br>
It is the substrate that is hurt or in pain. Only the natural substrate can
<br>
IN FACT (forget &quot;appearances&quot;) have these two properties. We are apples,
<br>
the silk flower is an orange. 
<br>
<p>This is how I explain these matters to religious/spiritual communities. And
<br>
trying to build human Alife has only increased my appreciation of natural
<br>
human life. Study any 3 year old, and watch their perfectly synched, smooth
<br>
symphony of sensors, consciousness, self, and actuators. I am always left
<br>
with the conclusion that it is oddly elegant to the extreme. 
<br>
<p>I think I'd better give this a name, as it is the foundation of my R/D. I
<br>
will call it the Long Silk Flower Analogy.
