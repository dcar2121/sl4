<p>Nick restated what I said to Hans back in 1986, but it is still the same 
<br>
conundrum.
<br>
<p>******************************************
<br>
The Simulation Argument is a rather intriguing argument made by Nick 
<br>
Bostrom. It states that:
<br>
&quot;At least one of the following propositions is true:
<br>
(1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a 
<br>
posthuman stage;
<br>
<p>[Nick is equating &quot;enough computational resources to run a 
<br>
evolutionary/historical simulation&quot; with &quot;posthuman.&quot;  I am not sure 
<br>
&quot;posthuman&quot; was a word I used in those days, but given 20 years I think it 
<br>
is a fair restatement.]
<br>
<p>(2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant 
<br>
number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof);
<br>
(3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.
<br>
<p>[I stated it to Hans that future humans with a vast computations resources 
<br>
*would* simulate the present world and therefore we had had this 
<br>
conversation many times before (unlikely this was the first).  The way Nick 
<br>
puts it is, in my opinion, equivalent.]
<br>
<p>It follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will 
<br>
one day become posthumans who run ancestor-simulations is false, unless we 
<br>
are currently living in a simulation.&quot; 
<br>
(&lt;<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a>&gt;<a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">http://www.simulation-argument.com/</a>)
<br>
**********************
<br>
This follows logically.  If they run vast numbers of simulations, the 
<br>
chances of this being the first time is close to zero, but never exactly zero.
<br>
<p>Is this a simulation or not?  Who knows?  Does it make any 
<br>
difference?  Nope.  If it concerns you, spread the meme, &quot;Thou shall not 
<br>
simulate the past!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;x unless y&quot; does mean that x is mutually exclusive with y. Thus, his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conclusion is false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Some of you thought Bostrom did take into consideration that some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post-singularity ET would create simulations, and that others would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not.  My point in writing that was that the statement was worded poorly, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and possibly exposing a Modernist perspective that progress is one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;path.  What happens to the argument if exactly 50 percent of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post-singularity ET create simulations?
</em><br>
<p>Somehow I missed what ETs have to do with it.  This was about post*humans* 
<br>
unless you are making the case that we are in a simulation  run by 
<br>
ETs.  (Actually that *would* explain a lot.)
<br>
<p>The real question is why I was hit out of the blue with this strange idea 
<br>
while talking to Hans 20 years ago?
<br>
<p>The only interesting possibility is that some posthuman jokester interfered 
<br>
with the simulation and planted it in my mind.  (Evil chuckles in the 
<br>
background.)
<br>
<p>If you know anything about my history, especially the last ten years, you 
<br>
would understand my half joking comments about being a character in a 
<br>
collaboration by Gore Vidal and John Grisham with overtones of Steven King.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps it is just karma payback to have a UFO cult trying to kill me 
<br>
because of the UFO hoaxes I pulled 40 plus years ago.
