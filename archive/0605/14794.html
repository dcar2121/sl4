<p>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The nanomachine haze that had fogged her image and now her real body 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;withdrew into the low table.  Her family was seated on the floor waiting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for her to awake.  She greeted her family and in voice talk said goodbye 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the image of an old man Suskulan was projecting.  Then they stepped 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through the clinic's keyhole door to where the other members of the tata 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were waiting for a joyous celebration of the healing of Zaba.
</em><br>
<p>Her family had visited &quot;by phone&quot; every day, but were still delighted and 
<br>
relieved that Zaba was back with no visible effects from being shot.  Her 
<br>
parents had been worried that her value as a bride might have been damaged, 
<br>
but none of the tata seemed to be concerned, only very proud of the growing 
<br>
powers of their clinic Suskulan.  (The elders had long since wildly 
<br>
inflated the value of the fetish they had traded for the clinic seed.)
<br>
<p>She had been warned not to flaunt her new knowledge to adults and with 
<br>
Suskulan's help had built temporary inhibitions into her mental 
<br>
processes.  She was under no such injunction toward the other children, 
<br>
though.  They were absolutely fascinated and wanted the ability to talk to 
<br>
Suskulan in the spirit world as well.  In spirit world talk Zaba asked 
<br>
Suskulan if he would give the others an &quot;interface&quot; like she had.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes, though not in one day like I did with you.  It takes several days to 
<br>
a week for an interface to establish itself unless you are very cold.&quot;
<br>
<p>And so, over the next month the children from 5 to 15 acquired interfaces 
<br>
to the local net, some of them getting mothers to take them to Suskulan for 
<br>
&quot;belly pain&quot; and others just slipping away to the clinic for an hour.
<br>
<p>A few days after Zaba was healed the village elders visited Suskulan to see 
<br>
if he knew how to prevent another of their people from being shot.
<br>
<p>Suskulan had expected this question.
<br>
<p>&quot;I, Suskulan, can augment the spirits in your powerful fetishes.  Placed 
<br>
around your gardens on tall poles they will chatter like a monkey if 
<br>
someone approaches who is not of the tata.&quot;
<br>
<p>Suskulan's image wavered into a more unsubstantial translucent mode.  The 
<br>
village elders quickly agreed to bring him a number of fetishes to be 
<br>
&quot;augmented.&quot;
<br>
<p>By the next evening, he had a dozen fetish skulls
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.garycook.co.uk/Africa/Togo/photo1-6.html">http://www.garycook.co.uk/Africa/Togo/photo1-6.html</a>
<br>
<p>and the 2-meter poles to hold them placed inside the clinic.  Suskulan's 
<br>
fog of nanomachines equipped each of the skulls with eyes, a solar power 
<br>
collector hat, power storage and a local area transceiver plus enough 
<br>
utility fog to serve as local actuators.
<br>
<p>There was argument that night if men or women should plant the poles so 
<br>
they asked Suskulan.
<br>
<p>&quot;Children,&quot; he told them.  &quot;Three boys and three girls.&quot;  He told them that 
<br>
Zaba should be included
<br>
<p>Zaba and five other older children took the ward poles out to the garden, 
<br>
planting the first few along the path at 50 meter intervals where they 
<br>
could serve as relays.   Zaba was delighted she could spirit talk to 
<br>
Suskulan through the ward poles all the way to the garden.  Suskulan 
<br>
directed where the ward poles should be planted through her.
<br>
<p>It was prudent those children planted the ward poles and that the adults 
<br>
didn't get a good look at them.  Suskulan had indulged his sense of humor 
<br>
by regenerating skin and hair on the fetish skulls and placing eyes in the 
<br>
sockets that disturbingly rolled this way and that.
<br>
<p>In the week after the poles were planted, they grew roots like the ones 
<br>
that had anchored the clinic seed when it first sprouted.  The poles grew 
<br>
dark leaves for solar collectors and the fetishes were able to rotate on 
<br>
the pole.  (An artistic flourish since they had eyes in the back and sides 
<br>
of the head as well as the front.)  All of the poles became strong beyond 
<br>
belief as Suskulan's remote controlled assemblers laid down nanotube 
<br>
fibers.  Two of them telescoped up ten meters over a period of weeks to get 
<br>
a wide area view.
<br>
<p>Who had shot Zaba remained a mystery.  Suskulan and the neighboring clinics 
<br>
never located a suspect.
<br>
<p>December 2043
<br>
<p>The next dry season was almost as brutal as the first.  Suskulan was asked 
<br>
about supplying the tata with food.  He explained that was beyond what he 
<br>
was permitted to do.  Food again was in short supply.  Suskulan restored 
<br>
fat on children several at a time.  Instead of their being unconscious 
<br>
while it was done, or talking only to him, he let them play together in the 
<br>
spirit world, their bodies cooled to near freezing and experiencing ten 
<br>
hours for every real time hour.
<br>
<p>Suskulan had enough distributed processing now that wire frame body images 
<br>
had been replaced by polygons, better than cartoons but simplified compared 
<br>
to real life.  The physics model was earth standard even to the point of 
<br>
pain from running into a spirit world tree.
<br>
<p>The children who were so inclined were offered instruction.  Most of the 
<br>
children learned enough to manipulate the web cameras where they could look 
<br>
out at places across the world and as far out as geosynchronous orbit and 
<br>
to play games (of which there was a huge variety) in the spirit 
<br>
world.  Eventually they discovered the library that could show them movies.
<br>
<p>They finally understood the mysterious fixed lights in the sky that had 
<br>
appeared ten years before as &quot;solar power satellites,&quot; or &quot;power sats&quot; that 
<br>
converted sunlight into microwaves that were beamed to giant receivers on 
<br>
earth.
<br>
<p>In spite of efforts by the children to keep their extra vision secret, the 
<br>
adults figured out the children could see through the ward poles because it 
<br>
became impossible to sneak up on one of the children if they were near the 
<br>
garden.
<br>
<p>The adults asked Suskulan how it was done and could they get it 
<br>
too?  Shortly the older children had to move away from the garden if they 
<br>
wanted privacy for sex.  Then they discovered that sex in the spirit world 
<br>
was more fun, especially after they talked Suskulan into locally reducing 
<br>
the gravity in the physics models.  (Sex in the simulation had no 
<br>
biological consequences; producing food *out* of the simulation and 
<br>
producing babies *in* the simulated world being the two built in limits 
<br>
Suskulan had no desire to break.)
<br>
<p>By the end of the dry season, the tata inhabitants were spending half their 
<br>
time with their bodies in a very cold state deep under the clinic and their 
<br>
minds in the spirit world--which now sported a copy of the tata sitting in 
<br>
the middle of an otherwise uninhabited world.  With the start of the wet 
<br>
season and the need to plant and maintain the physical-world houses all of 
<br>
them were out of the clinic for a few months except when they needed it for 
<br>
medical reasons.
<br>
<p>Expecting him to say no, the tata elders asked Suskulan if he could make 
<br>
their houses more resistant to the rain.  To their surprise, Suskulan 
<br>
agreed and poured a large store of fuel and molecular parts into weather 
<br>
proofing the mud dwellings with tiny diamond sheets.   The houses didn't 
<br>
look different after Suskulan worked on them but they were as proof against 
<br>
the weather as the clinic walls.
<br>
<p>Just before the next dry season arrived, Suskulan got another update, and 
<br>
with the additional processing he installed, life within the &quot;spirit world&quot; 
<br>
became very much like that outside in attention to detail.  (Except no 
<br>
bedbugs, lice or mosquitoes!)
<br>
<p>December 2044
<br>
<p>With the start of the dry season, more and more of the tata members spent 
<br>
most of their time in the sprit world, sometimes sleeping there and only 
<br>
coming out to work the gardens or harvest.  With substantially fewer people 
<br>
eating, the granaries filled up, reducing the need to spend time in the 
<br>
physical world even more.  Weather proofing the houses further reduced the 
<br>
need to spend time a lot of time in the physical world.
<br>
<p>May 2044
<br>
<p>Just after the wet season started a &quot;mole&quot; laying an optical fiber burrowed 
<br>
into the tata linking Suskulan to the rest of the clinics.  No longer 
<br>
limited by satellite bandwidth and latency, his &quot;patients&quot; could travel by 
<br>
optical fiber and experience the virtual or physical world any place on the 
<br>
planet while their bodies lay in Suskulan's underground extension.  Few of 
<br>
them were interested in going outside of their language group, even with 
<br>
excellent translation services (Zaba was an exception).  But they did use 
<br>
&quot;seven league boots&quot; to visit relatives in other tatas, something that had 
<br>
been curtailed since the pox years.
<br>
<p>At the same time those in the sprit world were allowed to change the 
<br>
simulation, locally for their own consciousness or if they wanted to change 
<br>
public parts by consensus.  The spirit world tata didn't change much, but 
<br>
the inside of the dwellings became larger than the outside as Suskulan 
<br>
relaxed the physics rules on request.
<br>
<p>Zaba often talked to Suskulan.  She eventually acquired a top-level 
<br>
understanding of all of human knowledge and had access to the details 
<br>
through simulated memory.  Suskulan warned her that she would have a 
<br>
difficult time in the physical world if she got out of communication 
<br>
because her mind had expanded well beyond that could be supported in a brain.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why would I want to go back to being stupid?&quot; she responded, but, after 
<br>
thinking about it, she warmed up her body and moved her consciousness back 
<br>
into her original brain.  Her boy friend was deep in a game and would not 
<br>
come along.
<br>
<p>Zaba was one of the few Suskulan permitted to be in physical state, in his 
<br>
underground extensions.  He was not concerned about the safety of his racks 
<br>
of freezing cold members of the tata, supported in a web of nanomachines, 
<br>
he just didn't want those who did want to know how they went in and out of 
<br>
the spirit world to be concerned about the underlying physical details.
<br>
<p>She rode up the elevator and left the clinic and the spirit world for a 
<br>
day.  Walking beyond the reach of the local net was a disconcerting 
<br>
experience at first but even without the net, Zaba's mind was 
<br>
impressive.  She remembered what Suskulan had said about staying awake and 
<br>
learning while being healed and how it would change her and the people of 
<br>
the tata.
<br>
<p>It certainly had.
<br>
<p>For better or for worse?
<br>
<p>For better in that nobody died of fevers or nasty parasites and nobody 
<br>
starved.  People didn't even die of old age with a clinic to regress age 
<br>
for them and they only aged in the spirit world to the extent they wanted.
<br>
<p>For worse in that she could not have children unless she left the clinic 
<br>
for their gestation.
<br>
<p>Since fetal development was arrested while in the clinic, (but not 
<br>
post-birth somatic growth) a number of families stuck it out until a child 
<br>
was born, then moved back into the spirit world tata to raise the child.
<br>
<p>Zaba visited with the few remaining families in person, then returned to 
<br>
the clinic and the spirit world.  She was not inclined to leave it again.
<br>
<p><p>December 2045
<br>
<p>By the start of the dry season in 2045 the presence of physical-state 
<br>
humans was rare, not just in Suskulan's tata, but in a wave moving south 
<br>
along the routes Lothar, Mabo and their fellow clinic seed planters had 
<br>
traveled so long ago.  Suskulan used extensions made of utility fog to keep 
<br>
the leaves and fallen palm fronds swept out of the tata.  The 
<br>
weatherproofed tata required little other maintenance
<br>
<p>May 2046
<br>
<p>A few months after the last family from the tata moved into the spirit 
<br>
world with no intent to come out, Suskulan rounded up the tata's 
<br>
elders.   Some of them were living in simulated palaces with dozens of 
<br>
simulated servants and companions.
<br>
<p>Taking on his translucent vestige from his first meeting with them, he 
<br>
addressed the group in a simulation of the physical-world clinic.
<br>
<p>&quot;Remember the leopard who pissed on Lothar's Land Rover when he brought the 
<br>
clinic seed to your tata&quot;?
<br>
<p>They did and laughed at the memory.
<br>
<p>&quot;That leopard has been nosing around the empty physical-world tata.&quot;
<br>
<p>Suskulan showed them video of the large curious cat cautiously 
<br>
investigating the neatly maintained but empty tata.
<br>
<p>&quot;The physical-world tata is your property, and for that matter, the clinic 
<br>
that is Suskulan is your property.&quot;  Suskulan reminded them, &quot;You exchanged 
<br>
a valuable fetish for it.&quot;   The elders accepted this, though it made them 
<br>
a bit uncomfortable.
<br>
<p>&quot;Would you mind if the leopard slept in one of the houses?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Will you chase him out when we go back to visit the physical world?&quot;
<br>
<p>With assurances from Suskulan that he would run the leopard off if anyone 
<br>
ventured back into the physical-world tata they said the leopard could 
<br>
sleep in the tata.
<br>
<p>The tata was home to the leopard for the rest of his life.
