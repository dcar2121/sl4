<p>
Ben is pretty spot on here.  There are many possible approaches and
<br>
views that will not be covered; there simply isn't enough time.  I
<br>
can't speak for the speakers, nor for the extent to which any one of
<br>
them will focus his or her time on regulation.  But please note that
<br>
the Summit has an open invitation for questions from the public
<br>
(sss.stanford.edu, lower left-hand column):
<br>
<p>What's Your Question?
<br>
&quot;Would you like to participate as more than an audience member? A
<br>
selection of questions submitted will be answered at the summit. You
<br>
can address your question generally or to a specific participant. Let
<br>
us know what you want answered and whether we may use your name.&quot;
<br>
<p>I encourage anyone with concerns about regulation who would like to
<br>
increase the chance of this topic being mentioned to submit them in
<br>
question form to sss-inquiries@lists.stanford.edu.  (Questions on
<br>
other topics are of course also welcome.)  Some questions will be
<br>
answered at the summit, and others may be answered afterwards on the
<br>
site.
<br>
<p>And regardless of what side of the various issues you come down on, I
<br>
thank you for your interest in and concern for the safety and
<br>
prosperity of our shared future.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<pre>
