I've read just about everything Hawkins has written on the subject,
<br>
and while he is not trying to create a general intelligence (at least
<br>
that is not his stated goal) I think that an approach similar to his
<br>
would be doomed to success. He is essentially (though he came at it
<br>
from a different angle) taking the ideas of Judea Pearl and
<br>
incorporating time into the belief propagation nodes. I'm not sure
<br>
explicitly including time into the individual nodes is the best way to
<br>
do it, but it does appear that the brain does something along those
<br>
lines, so that is the path that he is following.
<br>
<p>If anything, I am glad that I found the work of Judea Pearl through
<br>
Hawkins. Everyone on this list should read this book:
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558604790/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/104-2871874-9293504?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558604790/ref=pd_rvi_gw_1/104-2871874-9293504?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155</a>©<br>
<p>As for built-in structure, you should read the part of that book about
<br>
constructing trees or polytrees for a given set of input data.

<em>&gt; It also doesn't appear to include sufficient detail to judge whether or
