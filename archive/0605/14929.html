<p>As I understand it, memories are physical
<br>
structures in the brain and are in some respects
<br>
physiologically treated as if they were real and
<br>
present sensations (this is a tenet of NLP, borne
<br>
out by experiments; vividly imagining an even
<br>
that has not happened also activates brain
<br>
regions as if it were real and present; the
<br>
easiest way to envision this is to recall the
<br>
quickening heartbeat you may have felt watching a
<br>
horror film or something a little more
<br>
adult-oriented). Recent experiments also suggest
<br>
that we have brain structures devoted to modeling
<br>
the emotional states of others; sociopathy may
<br>
result when these structures don't work properly.
<br>
Persons who do not empathize well can be very
<br>
effective competitors, thus succeeding
<br>
reproductively as individuals, but may either
<br>
harm or help their social units competitively.
<br>
Notoriously, Ghenghis Khan has 13 million
<br>
descendants. On the other hand he left
<br>
once-wealthy Central Asia bankrupt and backward
<br>
ever since.
<br>
<p>When you come right down to it, morality...
<br>
<p>Actually, I prefer the word ETHICS! because
<br>
ethics refers to how you treat others while
<br>
'morality' tends to mean whatever ill-conceived
<br>
ersatz the speaker may have sneakily substituted
<br>
for ethics, e.g. 'Absolutely no sex unless in the
<br>
male-female marriage bed for the express purpose
<br>
of making babies!' How many times must I say this
<br>
before someone notices I said it? This list is
<br>
supposed to be all about rigorous, precise
<br>
thought, yet this muddy term 'morality' will not
<br>
go away.
<br>
<p>In any case, to finish that unfinished sentence,
<br>
ethical behavior is a remarkably efficient marker
<br>
of intelligence in many cases. In fiction, it's
<br>
the rogue who is interesting, but in real lfe
<br>
it's usually the ethical actor who is ultimately
<br>
more interesting, since hir interests are more
<br>
interesting than self-aggrandizement and power.
<br>
This is not to say that a superintelligent being
<br>
will be a tender-hearted milksop, but I would
<br>
expect hir to find any needless cruelty
<br>
uninspiring.
<br>
<p>This is why I do not fling gratuitous insults at
<br>
the other idiots on the SL4 list
<br>
ehehehhahahahahh! ;-D
<br>
<p>Bottom line, as I see it: if one chooses
<br>
nihilism, so be it, but it's an all-in bet. To
<br>
see what happens when a true nihilist loses this
<br>
ultimate bet, I refer you to a DVD of 'Downfall'
<br>
starring Bruno Ganz; it's very good.
