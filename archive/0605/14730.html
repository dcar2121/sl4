</em><br>
<p>That is *not* the distinction I'm trying to make.  My distinction is 
<br>
between people who are very careful about what they predict, and people 
<br>
who are telling stories.  Telling stories is a very ancient human habit. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as we know, it goes back to the dawn of human intelligence. 
<br>
Science is a recent invention, and it did have to be invented.
<br>
<p>People who are highly skilled in a specific field, such as designing 
<br>
computer chips, may not know the *separate and distinct* skills of 
<br>
rationality required to realize *how difficult* it is to make a forecast 
<br>
20 years out.  They may not realize that their skill at designing chips 
<br>
does not extend to predicting the factors of psychology, economics, and 
<br>
sheer random chance that determine real-world events in 20 years.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Let me ask another way: what predictions (or predictors) do you favor 
</em><br>
today?
<br>
<em> &gt; Who is in a position to know and is giving reliable forecasts of 
</em><br>
what's to
<br>
<em> &gt; come in the area of AGI?
</em><br>
<p>The default answer is NO ONE.  Anyone who wants to stake the surprising 
<br>
claim that some specific facet of the unvisited and unseen future is 
<br>
predictable, carries the burden of proof.
<br>
<p>This is not a sports game.  I don't have to pick a team.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for AGI, maybe I've just been duped by predictions in newspaper stories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and missed those by people who should know.  We had Newell and Simon the the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50s, fresh from the success of their General Problem Solver, predicting big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things for AI (and quickly).  They certainly had me going.  Was it wrong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listen to them?
</em><br>
<p>By default, yes.  If you listened to them, you ought to be able to 
<br>
explain why.  Or were you hearkening with awestruck ears to the words of 
<br>
a Great and Eminent Priest, rather than evaluating the one's arguments?
<br>
<p>Let me put it another way:  *Rationality works.*
<br>
<p>It's very hard to use correctly, but when you use it correctly, it 
<br>
should *work*, not fail.
<br>
<p>The novice makes a mistake and says, &quot;The Art failed me.&quot;
<br>
The expert makes a mistake and says, &quot;I failed my Art.&quot;
<br>
<p>You seem to be thinking that it was perfectly all right for you to 
<br>
believe Newell and Simon.  And yet, this led you to an incorrect answer. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hint that you - and they - did something wrong.  The true 
<br>
Way should not fail you.  This doesn't mean that the true Way can 
<br>
predict the future - but the true Way ought to indicate correctly when 
<br>
you are ignorant; it should not give you strongly confident predictions 
<br>
of a wrong answer.
