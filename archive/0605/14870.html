</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If what we mean by the word Singularity is the creation of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would *almost* be possible for a top thinker to assign a negligible

</em><br>
Let's think about this definition a bit.  I would argue that any well
<br>
run group is &quot;smarter-than-human intelligence&quot;, especially if it
<br>
contains experts in several different fields who are listened to
<br>
respectfully. 
<br>
<p>I'm sure that it is possible to define what is meant, but I would think
<br>
that the proffered definition needs a bit of work.  OTOH, in Vinge's
<br>
original paper one of the scenarios that he proposed DID involve groups
<br>
of people as integral parts of the &quot;mind&quot; of the singularity.  So even
<br>
from the start it was intended that people be considered as a possible
<br>
component.  I.e., the &quot;super-human intelligence&quot; would need to be not
<br>
the people, but rather some larger entity that contained them as components.
<br>
<p>I would further suggest that one indispensable requirement for the
<br>
singularity to have been achieved is that the thought processes of this
<br>
super-human entity be considerably faster than those of a discussion
<br>
group.  How much faster?  Note that mailing lists have dramatically
<br>
speeded up the rate of information transfer, but we don't consider that
<br>
*they* have created the singularity.  (Well, not usually.  Don't forget
<br>
the character in Accelerando who argued that the Singularity occurred
<br>
when the first Internet packet was transmitted.)
