It's also true that he chose to present the ways he was most interested
<br>
in and involved in as the most likely.  Sometimes he only presented one
<br>
way.  If this were a work of academic science rather than a work of
<br>
rhetoric this would be a serious flaw, but I don't think that very many
<br>
people expect futurologists to be infallible prophets, and to me that
<br>
doesn't detract from the book (even if I disagree with how intelligent
<br>
computers will first appear).  He's not just forecasting, he's trying to
<br>
create the future that he wants.  Will he be successful?  ??  I'm no
<br>
prophet either.  I doubt he'll be truly successful, but he may well push
<br>
the technologies of his interest faster than they would otherwise go.
<br>
<p>FWIW, I recently heard that ?USC? (some university in southern
<br>
California) had sequenced the genome of spiny lobsters.  I don't know if
<br>
this is fact copying art, or whether Charles Stross has inside information.
