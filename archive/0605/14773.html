<em>&gt; Old, old, old alternative hypothesis disconfirmed a dozen ways from

<em>&gt; thousands of papers.  These are not my ideas, these are the mainstream 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting with &quot;Judgment Under Uncertainty&quot; and moving on to &quot;Heuristics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Biases&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You just attacked an argument that has nothing whatsoever to do with the 
<br>
claim that I actually made.
<br>
<p>The claim that I made was *not*:
<br>
<p>(1*)  Tversky and Kahneman (etc.) failed to prove their case that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human reasoning behavior is flawed, because there are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good alternative explanations that can completely account
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all of their data.
<br>
<p>In fact, I explicitly disavow this conclusion:
<br>
<p>[Yudkowsky:]
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In each of these experiments, human psychology fails to follow the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rules of probability theory.
</em><br>
<p>[Loosemore:]
<br>
<em>&gt; Correct:  because in normal discourse, human psychology is required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry out far more complex, broad-spectrum cognitive processing than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mere calculation of probabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People are not very good at doing strict probability calculations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because those calculations require mechanisms that have to be trained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into them rather carefully, in order to avoid the problem of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triggering all those other mechanisms, which in the normal course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being a thinking creature are actually a lot more useful.
</em><br>
<p>You will notice that I clearly acknowledge here that human reasoning
<br>
ability is flawed.  I am not challenging this basic point and saying 
<br>
that the experimental data supporting it can be explained away.  That
<br>
question (about the validity of claim 1*) was thoroughly addressed by 
<br>
the literature, and what those studies tried to do was to eliminate all 
<br>
the other factors that were contributing to the effects, to see if there 
<br>
was any residual effect of pure irrationality.
<br>
<p>My interpretation of the particular experiments that you cite (and
<br>
remember, you were the one who chose to cite experiments where the
<br>
effect was confounded with other factors) is that *other* *cognitive*
<br>
*mechanisms* played at least some role in interfering with the subjects' 
<br>
interpretation of the questions, or interfered with their ability to 
<br>
execute a probability calculation.  Those weak studies were a good 
<br>
illustration that other things were at work, and that is the reason why 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I used them to illustrate possible interpretations of what was going 
<br>
on.  For what it is worth, you will note (if you read the literature) 
<br>
that the &quot;irrationality&quot; effects are diminished when more trouble is 
<br>
taken to eliminate these other things .... evidence that they were 
<br>
indeed responsible for part of the original effect.
<br>
<p>Are you clear on this distinction so far?  It is not that [Other
<br>
mechanisms interfered with the reasoning, and without those other
<br>
mechanisms the reasoning would have been perfect], it is that [Other
<br>
mechanisms interfered with the reasoning and *partially* accounted for
<br>
the imperfect reasoning].
<br>
<p>If you read my post in detail, you can see that the point I was trying 
<br>
to focus on was the *nature* of the mechanisms that were causing some of 
<br>
the reasoning errors:  unlike the people in the literature, whose put a 
<br>
lot of effort into eliminating these other effects to see what remained, 
<br>
my goal was to focus on what those other mechanisms were doing and how 
<br>
important they might be in the larger scheme of things.
<br>
<p>Specifically, there are two interpretations of their role:
<br>
<p>1) The interfering mechanisms were just dumb, maladaptive strategies.
<br>
Basically, systematic biasses and mistakes.
<br>
<p>2) These other mechanisms were not just systematic biasses, but may
<br>
actually have been components of very powerful, sensible, adaptive 
<br>
cognitive mechanisms that do not use logical reasoning, and without 
<br>
which the system as a whole could not function.  A number of people have 
<br>
arguments that are equal or closely related to this point, so
<br>
<p>Interpretation (1) is the default assumption in the literature.  To the
<br>
extent that the literature looked at what was going on in these
<br>
experiments, it tended to treat the situation as one of rationality
<br>
corrupted by mistakes.
<br>
<p>Interpretation (2) is hard to investigate.  These other mechanisms
<br>
are extremely hard to pin down, and if you know anything at all about
<br>
the nature of the experimentation/theorization cycle in the science of
<br>
cognitive psychology (something that I have a few concerns about, given
<br>
your armchair experience in the field), you will know that what is
<br>
difficult to address by experiments tends to be ignored.
<br>
<p>But just because they are ignored, that does not mean they do not exist,
<br>
and their existence would have profound implications for the position
<br>
you take vis a vis the role of rationality in human thought.
<br>
<p>*That* was the argument in my post.  Not the silly argument that Tversky
<br>
and Kahneman's results can be completely explained away.
<br>
<p>In the face of the great difficulty involved in trying to assess the 
<br>
relative importance of those other mechanisms, I stuck my neck out and 
<br>
offered some examples of what they might be doing, in an attempt to show 
<br>
that they might not have been mistakes or dumb strategies so much as 
<br>
powerful mechanisms that govern pragmatics.  I used the weakness in the 
<br>
Linda studies to highlight these possibilities.
<br>
<p>So when I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (my suggested interpretation would have to be tested:  I am
</em><br>
<em> &gt; only giving an existence proof for an alternative explanation
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- I could do the experiment, or maybe somebody already did
</em><br>
<em> &gt; do the experiment.
</em><br>
<p>I did not mean doing experiments to test whether these mechanisms could 
<br>
be used to explain away the irrationality effects (the totally naive and 
<br>
uninteresting Claim 1*), I was talking about the almost impossible kinds 
<br>
of experiments that might establish that exactly *what* those mechanisms 
<br>
might be.  People have done some work along these lines, but it is not 
<br>
very theoretically deep or empirically sound, in my opinion.
<br>
<p>And then, of course, I got to the important conclusion of my post, the 
<br>
way that some people apply their theories of human irrationality to the 
<br>
larger processes of cognition (in this case, judgments of future 
<br>
scenarios), and come to conclusions as if teh Conjunction Fallacy, and 
<br>
the general lack of logical reasoning skills, were the main determinants 
<br>
in those analyses.
<br>
<p>[BEGIN META-COMMENT]
<br>
<p>You say that your analysis represents the &quot;mainstream conclusions of an 
<br>
experimental science&quot;.  And you tell me that I should &quot;Go forth and read 
<br>
the literature before [I] make up [my] own interpretations&quot;.  You think 
<br>
I just made up my own interpretations?  I have had extensive discussions 
<br>
about these and other issues with people like Mike Oaksford (he and I 
<br>
were at UCNW Bangor together, then at Warwick), and to a lesser extent 
<br>
with Nick Chater.  I have also benefitted from many discussions with Tom 
<br>
Ormerod, who does experimental work in the same field.  In 1987 I did an 
<br>
extensive analysis of Phil Johnson-Laird's work, and although I never 
<br>
got to challenge him in person, I did talk to Alan Garnham, one of his 
<br>
students, and got a great deal of agreement from him about my 
<br>
understanding of the issues and my specific criticisms of J-L.
<br>
<p>Strangely, Oaksford and Chater disagree with your analysis, as do Evans 
<br>
and Over.  From my limited understanding of them, Maule and Hodgkinson 
<br>
(2002), and Tetlock and Mellers (2002) would also be in sympathy with 
<br>
the position I just took.  As would many others that I have talked with 
<br>
over the years, who do not work directly in this area.  Given all of 
<br>
this, it hardly sounds like you presented the mainstream conclusions of 
<br>
an experimental science.
<br>
<p>I disagree with you intellectually in some quite fundamental ways.  This 
<br>
is intellectual, not personal.
