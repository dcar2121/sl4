Nonetheless human engineers build CPUs that carry out multiplication, by  
<br>
working in the restricted space of CPU designs that the chip engineer  
<br>
*knows* carries out multiplication, which is a subset of all possible  
<br>
chip designs that carry out multiplication.  To build a bridge that  
<br>
stays up, it is not necessary to be able to calculate of any possible  
<br>
bridge whether it stays up.  It is enough to know at least one bridge  
<br>
design such that you can calculate that it supports at least 30 tons.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
With regard to Godel's (first) Incompleteness Theorem - and the consequent  
<br>
problem with infinite recursives, I think the bridge analogy is particularly  
<br>
apt. (Why do people always mention bridge-building in connection with Godel's  
<br>
Theorem(s)?)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Ely is entirely correct to say that it is only sufficient to know that  the 
<br>
bridge will, in practice, fulfil the purpose for which it is designed - i.e.  
<br>
bear a load of 30 tons minimum.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
However, in terms of engineering, it is possible to consider several  
<br>
different bridge architectures - Cantilever, Suspension or Box-girder, for  instance. 
<br>
All 3 bridge designs may meet the 30 ton specification, which now  introduces 
<br>
real-world practical &amp; engineering constraints, such as  cost-effectiveness, 
<br>
availability of materials, planning &amp; time deadlines,  etc., etc.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
For those not familiar, (in a nutshell) -
<br>
Kurt Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem (1931) states that :
<br>
&quot;For any formal logical system S, there will be a statement P of the  
<br>
language of S, such that if S is consistent, neither P nor its negation can be  
<br>
proved within S.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
That little sentence ruined a lifetime's mathematical work of Russell &amp;  
<br>
Whitehead. But the lesson for us here, (to continue with the bridge analogy) is  
<br>
that - if you spend too much time designing all possible bridges, you will find 
<br>
&nbsp;that your competitors will have gone a few miles up or down-river, designed, 
<br>
&nbsp;erected and opened their bridge to traffic - and they're already collecting 
<br>
the  tolls!!
