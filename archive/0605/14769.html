<p>Stupid is a harsh word; hasty is literally true but a little misleading - no
<br>
entity that's ever existed on Earth has enough brainpower to deduce the
<br>
correct answer to every slightly unfamiliar problem by pure ab initio
<br>
reasoning, not under the constraint of finite lifespan, so I wouldn't say
<br>
they were necessarily more stupid or hasty than the rest of us.
<br>
<p>What's going on is that those of us on this list will instantly get the
<br>
right answer because we happen to know the rule &quot;short sequences are more
<br>
probable than long ones&quot;. Most people don't know this rule because they've
<br>
never had occasion to use it. They do know the heuristic &quot;typical sequences
<br>
are more probable than atypical ones&quot; because it's used all the time in real
<br>
life, so that's what they used here.
<br>
<p>It so happens that it gives the wrong answer in this artificial case, but
<br>
the metaheuristic &quot;when asked a question, pick a heuristic that's mostly
<br>
worked before in apparently reasonably similar cases and just go with it
<br>
rather than wasting a lot of valuable time trying to deduce a provably right
<br>
answer ab initio&quot; is a good one; it's not reasonable to call people stupid
<br>
for using it.
<br>
<p>(Not that people don't ever do things that are genuinely stupid - I've done
<br>
plenty myself, for example! But incorrectly answering contrived questions
<br>
like this one isn't among them.)
