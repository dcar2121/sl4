<p>Don't you see how ludicrous this comparison is? Why not go the whole 
<br>
hog and mock the absence of gigantic zeppelins cruising the skies at 
<br>
an amazing 120 m.p.h.!! The immense wooden sailing craft that could 
<br>
circle the world in only months!!!
<br>
<p>We don't have moon bases for the same reason we're not recovering 
<br>
from spasm nuclear war, another frequent image in '50s sf. It turned 
<br>
out not to be good strategy. Bear in mind that Clarke's idea for 
<br>
geostationary radio sats were vast objects filled with human 
<br>
switch-board operators. The difference between then and now is 
<br>
precisely the driver that pushes the singularity. Instead of monkeys 
<br>
in local space, we have light-weight, powerful probes to the edge of 
<br>
the solar system sending back scads of images and data. Instead of 
<br>
large fixed videophones, we have thin pocket cellphones that take pix 
<br>
and transmit them instantly to anywhere in the world. The hazard of 
<br>
prediction isn't overheated imagination--it's an inevitable failure 
<br>
to see how realistic goals will be attained by other, more 
<br>
technically advanced means, and that indeed some goals will be 
<br>
abandoned as foolish, short-sighted and wasteful.
<br>
<p>MNT might turn out to be accomplished by tweaked RNA rather than 
<br>
mechanosynthesis, but if the end result realizes our wishes, so what?
<br>
<p>Your critique of Sunday journalist &quot;futurism&quot; is accurate, but nobody 
<br>
in this forum needs to be told that. If you wish to reprove Vernor 
<br>
Vinge, say, for his lack of understanding, you'll need to address his 
<br>
now-classic arguments from 20 years ago concerning the likely impacts 
<br>
of self-incrementing AI (whenever it happens). It's interesting that 
<br>
Vinge's name doesn't appear even once in the index of FUTURE HYPE, 
<br>
nor does &quot;technological singularity&quot;. Nor, for that matter, does 
<br>
Yudkowsky's. It's time to stop taking pot-shots at the lazy anoxic 
<br>
fish in the brine barrel and go instead after the big sharks.
