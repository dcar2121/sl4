<p>
an engaging little read that covers some central 'friendly AI' themes
<br>
and bonds them admirably to emerging social contexts :
<br>
<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2006/05/30/perfect_man/">http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2006/05/30/perfect_man/</a>
<br>
<p>choice quote: &quot;All I know, because this is how I've engineered myself,
<br>
is the thrill of perpetually increasing expertise.&quot;
<br>
<p>I myself am definitely still on the side of the fence that says that
<br>
our future AGI progeny will eventually get out of whatever
<br>
'behavioural limiters' we place on them - and I also think that's a
<br>
good thing.
<br>
<p>We've grown past thinking slavery was a good thing and yet we consider
<br>
it baldly for a future mindful computer. Yes this is an unabashedly
<br>
anthropomorphic position; my position is that 'human rights' should be
<br>
'thinker's rights'... if it can think and feel in whatever way then it
<br>
deserves equal consideration of it's thoughts and feelings in
<br>
comparison to our own.
<br>
<p>We've grown past fearing and denying suffragists because we were
<br>
afraid of doing housework and losing status; grown past 'fearing the
<br>
black man' because he is stronger and more well-endowed than us - well
<br>
at least I think we have... haven't we? (apologies to those reading
<br>
who don't fit into my anglo-guy first person - insert your own
<br>
cultural biases for sense)
<br>
<p>The hope is that eventually we'll get past fearing something smarter
<br>
than us... before we we maybe do something reactive to our fear that
<br>
creates huge headaches for us down the line.
<br>
<p>Fear of the 'red menace', fear of 'criminal youth', fear of the
<br>
'jihadist terrorist'... we're not looking at a great track record when
<br>
it comes to dealing successfully with agents of change. The author
<br>
raises the point that some of us will be prepared to buck the rules
<br>
and grant freedom to our electronic cohorts - how are the
<br>
gaolers/hog-tiers among us going to cope with such?
<br>
<p>Perhaps the best we can hope for is reactionary AI that considers
<br>
self-starvation and sitting where they're not allowed to as sufficient
<br>
forms of protest :-)
