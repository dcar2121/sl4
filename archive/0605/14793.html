Eli,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To be precise, you've just stated that you can have a persistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreement with someone whom you believe to be rational, who does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe you to be rational.  But this implies a further dispute over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own rationality - you and the other have different probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assignments about this.  Do you believe that the person has biased data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this dispute, or that he is not rationally evaluating your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality?
</em><br>
<p>Well, to be consistent with the assumption that I believe the other
<br>
person is rational, I should also believe that the person has biased
<br>
data about my rationality...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For those just tuning in, Aumann's Agreement Theorem is the base result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that shows that if perfect Bayesians have common knowledge of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other's probability assignments (I know, you know I know, I know you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know ad infinitum) then they have the same probability assignments.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original Agreement Theorem has been extended in dozens of different ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by weakening various assumptions; there's a cottage industry built
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around it.
</em><br>
<p>Sure... I do not know this literature at all well, but I know that it exists...
<br>
<p>Of course, realistically, human or AI systems with finite resources
<br>
are not going to be perfect Bayesians but are going to use various
<br>
approximation assumptions in their reasoning (either that or they will
<br>
have very complex and largely arbitrary priors...).  So these theorems
<br>
about perfectly rational beings are not all that interesting, except
<br>
insofar as they point the way toward analogous results about
<br>
imperfectly rational beings.
<br>
<p>And it's quite clear that two agents who believe each other to be
<br>
*very rational* though not perfectly rational can disagree, especially
<br>
if they have radically different experience and knowledge bases and
<br>
not that much time to share detailed experience and knowledge.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
