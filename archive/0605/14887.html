I believe that &quot;traditional morality&quot; is a part of memetic evolution. Groups
<br>
of human beings who are in competition for resources organize their activity
<br>
in a more or less efficient manner relative to their respective competitors.
<br>
Naturally if an individual in one of these socio-cultural groups refuses to
<br>
abide by the code of organization (morality/law/religiouspractice) then the
<br>
group will find some way to enforce their will. As time progresses and
<br>
cultures evolve through a sequence of cultural replication, extinction, and
<br>
mutation, more and more efficient systems of human organization and activity
<br>
are realized. So all artifice (including morality) is a part of memetic
<br>
natural selection. As such morality must evolve along with man. Asking what
<br>
is &quot;moral&quot; and what is ultimately &quot;good&quot; is the most radical of
<br>
philosophical questions which may not be answerable.
<br>
&nbsp;I act morally because it is in my nature to do so - I am a human being
<br>
living in 21st century western civilization and I find myself naturally
<br>
sharing the same memetic programming as most others in this civilization.
<br>
Also, because of that memetic programing and the genetic gift of rationality
<br>
I am able to identify myself with the human species and act toward the
<br>
rational goal of preserving my species.
<br>
In the end, however, the course of the evolution of the cosmos as been
<br>
predetermined. You may be free to choose one action as better than another
<br>
but you are not free to choose why you think the telos of that action is
<br>
better.

<em>&gt; &gt; Crockners Rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nice to know. Same apply to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've been lurking for a while, and the one thing that has really struck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that whilst a (largely commendable) near worship of rationality exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; SL4 list, this has a huge blindspot. Everyone cleaves nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unquestioningly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to wider societies superstitious moralism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are mistaken. There's quite a variety of opinions on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ethics and morality on the list, from those who believe there is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective morality, to those who, like you, believe that there's nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Compassion, gene driven animal emotion - evolved to further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between people - thus increasing chances of survival.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Check. Note though that increasing chances of survival is not teleological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much as consequential. Id est, compassion and the like appear, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right extent and in the right forms, to have survival value. Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should consider that for a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. Social conformity - again a gene driven animal instinct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Partly gene-driven, probably. Social comformity might also derive from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture or reasoned stances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3. Societal brainwashing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I see a disjunction between categories 2 and 3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Morality is completely artificial. Right and Wrong either do not exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't matter other than in the qualia that they cause the person who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he is acting wrongly/rightly - depending on your exact definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're assuming qualia matter. That's an interesting yet controversial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also completely artificial is an improperly phrased criticism, even if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I know what you mean. Mathematics is, or might be anyway, completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial. The sciences are completely artificial. Language is completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial. I'd say these things matter. Artificial is not a signifier of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth. More importantly, as you point out above, morality has pretty clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic bases, which are not artificial (unless evolution is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificer).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It could be argued that in some cases, acting morally benefits he/she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so due to reciprocity - but this is only in some cases and this course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action could be entirely derived from self-interest by moral nihilists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How so? A moral nihilist does not believe that any action is preferrable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other action in terms of moral content. Why would a moral nihilist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for cooperative constructive behaviour that benefits individuals?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Self-interest is as artificial (far more) than evolved morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Obviously, the first 2 points are a part of us - so suspending ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disbelief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concerning morality in everyday life may well lead to a happier more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fulfilling human life. However, once radical transhuman technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this will no-longer be nescissarilly true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It depends on what ways people choose to self-modify. I would argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some form of ethos is going to have to be kept, unless we want to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious trouble in the mid term. It would probably be a lot cleaner in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of referential transparency and such than evolved morality, though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As such, when considering/planning posthumanity we should reject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality and embrace moral nihilism. This is as the potential gain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; posthumanity (and acting entirely rationally when planning/considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it - to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ensure the best outcome) far outweighs the positive qualia felt by being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compassionate when considering posthumanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the imo most misguided part of your post. You've just used a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aren't you shooting yourself in the foot?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, I don't clearly see why moral nihilism is a necessary condition for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-humanity. (And playing the nihilist's advocate, why we should care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the gains (gains? stop the value judgements right there!) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-humanity.)
