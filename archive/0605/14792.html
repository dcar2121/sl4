<p>To be precise, you've just stated that you can have a persistent 
<br>
disagreement with someone whom you believe to be rational, who does not 
<br>
believe you to be rational.  But this implies a further dispute over 
<br>
your own rationality - you and the other have different probability 
<br>
assignments about this.  Do you believe that the person has biased data 
<br>
in this dispute, or that he is not rationally evaluating your own 
<br>
rationality?
<br>
<p>IIRC, I think one of Robin Hanson's papers tries to extend Aumann's 
<br>
Agreement Theorem to prove that either you don't believe the other 
<br>
person is meta-rational (rational in evaluations of self and others' 
<br>
rationality), or you believe that you were born with better &quot;ur-priors&quot;, 
<br>
that is, prior probabilities before any evidence whatsoever comes in (as 
<br>
opposed to priors in any particular situation, like mammographies and so 
<br>
on).  Robin Hanson concludes that since you have no reason to think you 
<br>
were luckily born with better ur-priors, you are being irrational. 
<br>
Personally I think the concept of &quot;meta-rationality&quot; is poorly defined, 
<br>
because the notion of &quot;trust in the probability assignments of a 
<br>
cognitive process&quot; is something I'm still trying to define rigorously 
<br>
myself.
<br>
<p>For those just tuning in, Aumann's Agreement Theorem is the base result 
<br>
that shows that if perfect Bayesians have common knowledge of each 
<br>
other's probability assignments (I know, you know I know, I know you 
<br>
know ad infinitum) then they have the same probability assignments.  The 
<br>
original Agreement Theorem has been extended in dozens of different ways 
<br>
by weakening various assumptions; there's a cottage industry built 
<br>
around it.
