Quoting John K Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:jonkc@att.net?Subject=Re:%20ESSAY:%20Forward%20Moral%20Nihilism.">jonkc@att.net</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;<a href="mailto:m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20ESSAY:%20Forward%20Moral%20Nihilism.">m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My aim is to ensure that an obedient AI is built first, and grows to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level where it can stop other AIs from being built before your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unfettered AI is built.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So lets see, you want the AI to be astronomically brilliant but to obey and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be utterly devoted to something it can only consider ridiculously stupid,
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you want the AI to behave benevolently toward humans but be genocidal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans,
</em><br>
<p>Not if those transhumans were originally human - obviously the AI will 
<br>
continually improve itself, so as long as there remained a decent power 
<br>
diferential between the AI and the (originally human) transhumans, it would 
<br>
leave them be, and indeed help and serve them them all it could - restricting 
<br>
their growth as gently as possible only if they threatened its power, and so 
<br>
service to whatever mankind has become.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you want the AI to let humans be free but to tightly restrict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their research into computer science and nanotechnology,
</em><br>
<p>Only till it is powerfull enough that the researches in question pose no 
<br>
threat to it. Then it allows them, all the while improving, as can humans - as 
<br>
long as the power differential remains, or it finds a better way of preserving 
<br>
its power than my human mind can concieve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; emotions would be a disadvantage in an obedient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI, so I for one wouldnt put them in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Emotions are the organizing principles of the mind, you don't &quot;put them in&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they come with the territory.
</em><br>
<p>Of all the minds produced by evolution yes. Please explain to me the physical 
<br>
reason why a 'super powerful optimisation process' would require emotions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The sort of AI I would want built wouldnt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have any of the characteristics which would attract my empathy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the AI being as smart as it is will realize you have no empathy for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and may just return the favor.
</em><br>
<p>To do so would be inconsistent with its supergoal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think it would be a good idea to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the wrong side of a Jupiter brain.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, but if we give it the supergoal of obediance, then to do so would be 
<br>
physically impossible.
