<p><em>&gt; Have you ever read &quot;The Moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Animal&lt;<a href="http://www.scifidimensions.com/Mar04/moralanimal.htm">http://www.scifidimensions.com/Mar04/moralanimal.htm</a>&gt;&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Robert Wright? This book looks at human morality and it's evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the lens of evolutionary psychology. Its a fantastic read IMO and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while it may not refute moral nihilism it certainly does add dimension to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the issue.  
</em><br>
<p>No, Ill look it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also what do you think of Nietzsche's moral philosophy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche saw himself as a nihilist while a young man but eventually saw his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way out of that darkness.
</em><br>
<p>Nietzsche's moral philosophy is very interesting. Origianlly the devoutest of 
<br>
christians, when he saw the flaws in his religion this led him to question and 
<br>
find the faults with morality as well. IMO this previous chritianity is his 
<br>
flaw - he saw moral nihilism as a great darkness because it had taken the 
<br>
comforting father figure of God and the certainty of absolute morality from 
<br>
him (on which IMO he had based much of his personality) and could not replace 
<br>
it. I dont think he ever really got over this.
<br>
<p>On his 'superman' philosophy of constructing ones own morality from moral 
<br>
nihilism - perhaps. But its something Id want to do post-singularity when I 
<br>
have an IQ 0f 5000000000000 - as opposed to now, and in doing so possible 
<br>
restricting said posthumanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unlike some I've studied philosophy for long enough to not glibly dismiss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your arguments based on primate instinct alone (i.e. the instinct that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abhors anti-social behavior or ideas). Also I think this discussion is truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SL4. Most on this list take for granted that there is such a thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;benevolence&quot; and that we should all be working hard to relieve &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering&quot;. I'm not saying this is wrong but it would be nice to here some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sophisticated arguments for exactly why anyone should care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything. 
</em><br>
<p>Definitely. What worries me is that AGI will be built based upon these 
<br>
assumptions, which will likely become obsolete in a posthuman future - leading 
<br>
to sub-optimal posthumanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we can't offer a philosophically rigorous refutation of moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nihilism then it will be quite difficult to program a machine AGI that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refute that position also. Just a thought.
</em><br>
<p>Quite possibly. Although, maybe to say so is anthropomorhising the AI?
