Bob, you said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Do you think that progress will stop just for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation?&quot;  Certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.  However, I don't think progress is exponential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Kurweil's Law of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Accelerating Returns, for example) since it never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been.  IMO, the rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of technological change in the West has been roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constant since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Industrial Revolution.
</em><br>
<p>So, you say that progress has never been exponential.
<br>
Dani Eder mentioned the GDP and manufacturing
<br>
productivity as an indication.
<br>
Even Moore's law has been going strong (or close
<br>
enough).
<br>
There are many irefutable examples in Kurzweil's TSIN
<br>
about exponential trends from the past to the present.
<br>
OK, so noone can predict the future.
<br>
But you are incapable of evaluating the past.
<br>
<p>You also said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To respond to your earlier email, you said, &quot;If only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the general populace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood how close we were and the potential of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these technologies. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only Bob. And you can define &quot;close&quot; as anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like.  Even a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centuries is close, though I see it as a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades until the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bloom of the aforementioned technologies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you define &quot;close&quot; as a couple of centuries, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm right with you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I'm pessimistic about seeing the full bloom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of AGI, nanotech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so on in just 20 years.
</em><br>
<p>Again you are sidestepping my main point. Which is
<br>
that you are assuming things about the perceptions of
<br>
the general population.
<br>
Specifically, you said that the majority of the
<br>
population percieves nanotech and renewable
<br>
energy(pressumably other techs as well) as current
<br>
technologies and so they think we are making much more
<br>
progress than we are.
<br>
<p>Your definition of &quot;the majority of the population&quot;
<br>
must be really skewed.
<br>
Out of personal observation, the majority of the
<br>
population leads a simple life. Nanotech (in the sense
<br>
of a MNfactory) is sci-fi for them, along with AGI,
<br>
moon bases and flying cars.
<br>
You are talking about a small part of the population
<br>
that thrives on sci-fi and enjoys future-hypes (your
<br>
imediate social circle, maybe?).
<br>
<p>IMO you haven't demonstrated any ability to logically
<br>
evaluate data and you haven't presented any sources to
<br>
compensate.
<br>
You've written a book though
