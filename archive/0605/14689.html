</em><br>
<p>Have you considered that maybe the arrival times of new technologies are 
<br>
just *not very predictable*?
<br>
<p>Managers have some pretty severe difficulty predicting how long a 
<br>
software project will take, even when the people on it are not doing 
<br>
basic research.  I feel a lot more confident asserting that it is 
<br>
theoretically possible and humanly practical to use Java to build a 
<br>
server-side flonging device, than asserting the project will finish by 
<br>
May 1st, 2007.
<br>
<p>Imagine that you knew how intelligence worked.  Moreover, imagine that 
<br>
you knew which approach would first succeed in building an Artificial 
<br>
Intelligence.  Imagine that you knew exactly which group would be first 
<br>
to build AI.  Imagine that you knew exactly how much money this group 
<br>
would invest in AI.  Imagine that you were personally acquainted with 
<br>
each of the researchers working on the project.  You STILL could not 
<br>
predict the arrival date of AI.  Now what makes you think you can 
<br>
predict the arrival date of AI when you DON'T know all this other stuff?
<br>
<p>Consider trying to predict in 1890 whether heavier-than-air powered 
<br>
flight was possible and practical and would happen someday, versus 
<br>
trying to predict that it would happen in 1903.
<br>
<p>To predict that flight is possible, all you need to think about is 
<br>
aerodynamics.  This you can do by science and the numbers.
<br>
<p>The causal path that determines the date of the *first* flight goes 
<br>
through monetary amounts available and invested, through intelligence 
<br>
and persistence of indivduals, through the specific approach tried - 
<br>
both for the first project to succeed, and for all the other projects 
<br>
that failed or came in second.  That's what determines the timing.  It 
<br>
involves personalities, psychologies, and plenty of sheer chance.  Why 
<br>
should you be able to predict, even in theory, that the first flight 
<br>
will happen in 1903?  You shouldn't overestimate the predictability of 
<br>
this event even in hindsight.  Maybe in most of the other Everett 
<br>
branches starting from 1890, the first flight happened in 1895, or 1915.
<br>
<p>PS:  Does the index of &quot;Future Hype&quot; mention Leo Szilard?  Now there was 
<br>
a serious futurist, though he lived before Tversky and Kahneman and 
<br>
didn't know to avoid the conjunction fallacy.
