Michael: it sounds like you think technologies like nanotech and AGI are not
<br>
only inevitable but close.  Why do you say that, given the poor record of
<br>
the futurist community in predicting the future?  You know the long list of
<br>
failed predictions as well as I do -- moon bases, videophones, and so on.
<br>
Perhaps you don't look to the futurist community but are making these
<br>
predictions yourself, but still the difficulty of seeing the future
<br>
correctly must apply -- no?
<br>
<p>IMO, most predictions are wrong (the bolder, the wronger!).  And any
<br>
entrepreneur will tell you that it's a brutal road from invention to
<br>
product, with most new products failing somewhere along the way.  Why are
<br>
you certain that these will succeed?

<p><p>Bob,
<br>
<p>The majority of the population sees nanotechnology, renewable energy, AGI
<br>
even AI and biotech as sci-fi.
<br>
If only the general populace understood how close we were and the potential
<br>
of these technologies. If only Bob. And you can define &quot;close&quot; as anything
<br>
you like.
<br>
Even a couple of centuries is close, though I see it as a couple of decades
<br>
until the full bloom of the aforementioned technologies. My point is that if
<br>
&quot;the majority of the population&quot; understood, they would make it a top
<br>
priority and strive to make these technologies bloom as fast as possible.
<br>
PC, internet, cellular phones. That's about it for the average Joe.
<br>
The &quot;things to come&quot; haven't had an impact on every day life yet and so are
<br>
in the realm of fantasy (like the PC, internet and cellular phones, when
<br>
they were in their first stages of development).
<br>
