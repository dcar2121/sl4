<p>At the risk of being tedious, can I point out that I said this already 
<br>
(yesterday)?  And that Dani Eder added another point to mine.  Neither 
<br>
of our comments seem to have made any difference to the discussion:  it 
<br>
has continued blindly on, confusion piled on top of confusion.
<br>
<p>I said:
<br>
<p>I think there is some confusion here that is causing several different 
<br>
types of argument to get tangled up.
<br>
<p>1) If there are people with no direct or indirect knowledge of a field 
<br>
who are making general futurist predictions of the Popular Mechanics 
<br>
sort, OR general dismissals of the &quot;This Is Not Going To Happen For A 
<br>
Long Time&quot; sort, then those kinds of analysis are worthless.
<br>
<p>2) On the other hand, there are some people who work in a particular 
<br>
field, or who know the technical side of a field well enough, who can 
<br>
make more informed judgments about what might be over the horizon.
<br>
<p>3) The exact meaning of some of the technologies is often completely 
<br>
garbled.  &quot;Nanotech&quot; used to mean something involving nanoscale 
<br>
replicating self-assemblers.  Today the term has been coopted to mean 
<br>
various forms of small particle technology, and as a result SOME people 
<br>
talk about &quot;nanotech&quot; being five years away -- but according to the 
<br>
original definition of the word, that is nonsense.
<br>
<p>and Dani added:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, technologies don't go from discovery to for
</em><br>

<em>&gt; The Wright Brothers, in addition to having a bicycle business on the side,

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now who was it that calculated quantitatively, based on previously confirmed

</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this, but dared a prediction anyway, why are you surprised that they were
