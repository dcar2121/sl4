I would distinguish between specific technologies,
<br>
applications of technology, and composite trends.
<br>
<p>The first gasoline-electric hybrid car was built in
<br>
1917, not long after internal combustion engines and
<br>
electric motors were developed.  It took until 
<br>
recently for practical mass-produced hybrids to
<br>
appear because they required improved batteries
<br>
and computers to perform better than pure gasoline-
<br>
driven cars.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, electric generators that run off
<br>
an internal combustion engine have been around for
<br>
quite a while.  Same basic components, but not
<br>
dependant on battery weight or computer control
<br>
to function well.
<br>
<p>Hybrid passenger cars are an application of several
<br>
technologies, each of which had its' own development
<br>
history. They had to compete against gas-only cars,
<br>
which were also improving, and needed the right
<br>
combination of concern for the environment and high
<br>
fuel prices for people to want to buy them in non-
<br>
trivial quantities.
<br>
<p>I would say that the timing of an application like
<br>
hybrid cars (or flying cars, a classic one that
<br>
hasn't happened) is very unpredictable, because it
<br>
depends on so many factors.  
<br>
<p>The discovery of a new
<br>
technology, such as high temperature superconductors,
<br>
carbon nanotubes, or atomic microscopes, is also
<br>
very unpredictable.  That is because it depends on one
<br>
person noticing something or having a bright idea.
<br>
About all you can do is say the laws of physics
<br>
don't preclude a technology, and that it therefore
<br>
may be developed someday.
<br>
<p>A composite trend, however, such as the price/
<br>
performance of computers or manufacturing
<br>
productivity,
<br>
are predictable to a reasonable degree.  In those
<br>
cases, the discoveries have been often made already,
<br>
and it is a case of getting it to the point of 
<br>
widepread use.  New manufacturing equipment is
<br>
twice as productive as the average of existing
<br>
equipment, so it is just a matter of comparing the
<br>
values of
<br>
capital spending to existing plant in place, and
<br>
you can get a pretty good idea of the pace of
<br>
improvement.
