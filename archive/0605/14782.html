Hmmm...
<br>
<p>Richard, I will stand by my statement that, in this particular problem,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; there's no conversational implicature here, and this error may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well be pure inferential stupidity.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, I didn't mean to imply that inferential stupidity is the
<br>
ONLY reason anyone might get the wrong answer to this problem. 
<br>
Inattention and misleading instructions could play a role, along with
<br>
other reasons that you mention.
<br>
<p>For any one experiment one can make a lot of arguments regarding the
<br>
possible reasons humans make wrong inferences.  A careful analysis of
<br>
human inferential performance requires analysis of behavior across a
<br>
lot of different experiments, and this is too much to do in detail in
<br>
spare time on this email list.
<br>
<p>I note that it would be pretty easy to make Novamente's inference engine either
<br>
<p>a-- get wrong answers on these inference puzzles, similar to the ones
<br>
many humans get
<br>
<p>b-- get correct answers to these inference puzzles
<br>
<p><p>The difference between a) and b) has to do with various parameters one
<br>
can set in Novamente's inference control process, not in the system's
<br>
inference rules itself.
<br>
<p>So, my own view is that humans make these errors, not because they are
<br>
fundamentally incapable of doing correct probabilistic inference, but
<br>
because for a variety of reasons when confronted with reasoning
<br>
problems they utilize an improperly or inadequately tuned inference
<br>
control process.  This may be because of inattention (not allocating
<br>
enough attention to the inference), it may be because of misleading
<br>
cues that bias the inference control process to look at the wrong data
<br>
or to be biased toward using the wrong knowledge or inference rules,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this is a deep issue, but my point is that by &quot;inferential
<br>
stupidity&quot; (an imprecise phrase, I admit) I did not mean incapability
<br>
to carry out correct uncertain inferences, but rather, stupid control
<br>
of the inference process in the particular context in question.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, some inferential errors may well be partly or largely caused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by conversational implicature and other such factors...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One of the beautiful things about us humans is that we have soooo many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different ways of being stupid, with so many different causes ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am just a little stunned at the two comments above (Eliezer's sarcasm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then your partial agreement that this cannot be explained except by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pure inferential stupidity).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stunned, because I am amazed at the inferential(?) stupidity that allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two AGI researchers to look at this experiment and not be able to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any factors that could have been involved.  [NOTE:  I use the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;stupidity,&quot; of course, not to get personal :-), but just as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rhetorical invitation for you to contrast and compare, if you will, your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own response to the experiment to the subjects' responses].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So here goes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, when subjects turn up to do experiments in psychologists' labs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all kinds of junk is going through their heads.  One of the main things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that, as you know, the general population has some pretty weird ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what psychology actually is, and what the researchers are up to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot of the time, I think, they view the experiment as some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test or competition between them and the experimenter, and they have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'prove' themselves smart in the experimenter's eyes.  This, if nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else, lends an element of stress in even the most relaxed of settings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, the experimenter cannot answer questions (often), so if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject reads the instructions and cannot understand them, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to do their best to interpret them.  I don't know if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clarification questions were allowed in the above experiment.  Do you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect they were not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third, subjects are often hunting for &quot;the&quot; way to solve the problem set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them.  For whatever reason, they assume that it would somehow be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricky or deceitful if the experimenter set them problems that require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to deploy more than one strategy.  So if they find one obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy, they go with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fourth, when they are given instructions by the experimenter (like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Relax and take your time, because it does not matter&quot;), they sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and perhaps frequently) appear to disregard some of the instructions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (so they hear the experimenter tell them to take their time, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that the experimenter is secretly measuring the time it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, anyway).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fifth, when the wording contains any element of ambiguity whatsoever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and sometimes ambiguity can be forced by the time constraints of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment, and not be at all obvious when we, at our leisure, read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instructions afterwards), they try to construct a model of what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimenter is probably trying to get them to do, to help them resolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their confusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sixth, the experimental materials can easily contain confusing features
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that nobody ever discovers.  (Such damaging features are discovered so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often in the years after an experiment is published, without ever being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noticed by the original experimenters, that it makes you wonder just how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much effort anyone ever takes to analyze possible problems with a design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before they go ahead and do it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're beginning to get the picture, I'm sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in the case of the above experiment, I had forgotten the punchline of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experiment, so I looked at it and did it on the spot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey presto:  my first answer was (2)!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?  Because, even though I had been primed by all the Conjunction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fallacy stuff in the last week, I completely forgot to notice that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first string was shorter than the other two (perhaps because all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RRRR strings misled my eye, in the way that you may, depending on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mail client, have had your own eye misled earlier in this sentence). And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the other hand I did notice (because I had been primed by the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant information given in the instructions) that there were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences between the proportions of Gs and Rs in the three strings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was also rushing because I felt some urgency to prove to myself that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could polish it off quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well well well.  I am stupid and irrational, apparently!   And there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no other explanation for my (or the subjects') behavior:  it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be anything except irrational stupidity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of the troubling little factors I catalogued above are matters of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good experimental design, but some of them are just so embarrassing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entire psychological community that they are ignored.  I mean, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *all* subjects come to your lab trying to second guess your intentions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no matter what you say to them, what the hell do you do?  Give up being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an experimental psychologist?  Of course not:  you agree with all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other psychologists to overlook the problems (at least, if your name is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not Gibson), and say that it will all come out in the wash.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are some of the reasons why the conclusions derived from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments like these (and the other several hundred in the literature)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't merit the kind of most-humans-are-irrational triumphalism that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see around this list all too often.  To say nothing of the kind of silly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sarcasm that only seems to demonstrate a complete ignorance of both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of experimental design and the implications that that has for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the robustness of conclusions derived from experiments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [And YES YES YES, if you could somehow do the impossible and eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the factors I just mentioned (you would have to at least draw the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject's attention to the fact that the first string is shorter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the others (*)), I know that we are still going to get an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (but reduced) percentage of people who simply cannot relate the length
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the string to the probability of getting the string to come up.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that case see my parallel arguments in the other post, which still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If either of you were actually speaking to a more robust version of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above experimental design, when you assessed the implications in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments above, then let me know.  If you were, that would have been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little sneaky, no?, because that really was not the experimental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocol that was quoted, and I, poor fool, have referenced that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular protocol in my example and not wasted a day chasing through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the literature looking for other, more sophisticated versions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design that eliminated ALL of the above issues (never learn, do I? :-)).
</em><br>

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (*)  Make the subject take part in an example session in which a bunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pseudo subjects take different positions (some of them betting on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short sequences), and give the subject the opportunity to observe a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases where someone else goes for a short sequence that is identical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own sequence up to that point, but in which the subject doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the $25 payout (while of course the other person does) and instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to wait for one more roll of the dice to see if they win.  Watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their face after that situation comes up (just for fun), and then later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give them the real test.  I bet $25 that after that, the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid-irrationals goes down by a factor of two, at least.  Maybe even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate the effect.  Doesn't prove a lot, except the sensitivity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experiment to factors other than inherent stupidity - which latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to be constant, no?
