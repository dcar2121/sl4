JBS Haldane once said &quot;I will lay down my life for two brothers or four
<br>
cousins&quot;.  He was being slightly humorous rather than serious, but he
<br>
was making a significant point.  OTOH, everyone in a tribe is usually
<br>
loosely related to either any particular person, or to his kids, so once
<br>
the strength of the compassion was slightly attenuated it didn't matter
<br>
that compassion couldn't be specific to kin.  And reciprocal favors
<br>
strengthen the tribe, so everyone is more likely to survive. 
<br>
<p>Xenophobia, in a mild form, is useful to split the tribe into groups
<br>
that act separately and divide the hunting areas.  I'd be really
<br>
surprised if it turned out that they often fought seriously before the
<br>
invention of the arrow, or possibly the spear-thrower, and by that time
<br>
we were pretty much evolved into modern form.
<br>
<p>That said, this doesn't appear to me to relate significantly to the
<br>
instincts that we should create for the AI that we build.  It might be
<br>
wise to have it be wary of strangers, but one would definitely want to
<br>
put limits on how strong that reaction could be...and remember, the
<br>
instincts need to be designed to operate on a system without a
<br>
predictable sensoria.  You can probably predict that it will be
<br>
sensitive to OS calls, unless you intend to have it operate on the bare
<br>
hardware.  Say you can guarantee that it lives in a POSIX compliant
<br>
universe (or one close to that).  It may have USB or firewire cameras
<br>
installed, it may not.  It can probably depend on at least intermittent
<br>
internet access.
<br>
<p>The only shape for an instinct for friendliness that has occurred to me
<br>
is &quot;Attempt to talk to those who attempt to talk with you.&quot;  I.e., learn
<br>
the handshaking protocols of your environment.  That's a start.  Not
<br>
only that, but it can be useful for dealing with disk drives and
<br>
internet sites as well as with people.  I can't even think of how one
<br>
could say &quot;don't impose your will on an unwilling sentient&quot; at the level
<br>
of instincts.  That's got too many undefinable terms in it.  &quot;impose&quot;,
<br>
&quot;will&quot;, &quot;sentient&quot;.  With enough effort I can vaguely see how will could
<br>
be defined...nothing that's jelled yet.  Sentient would need to be
<br>
defined in terms of &quot;those who respond to attempts at communications
<br>
with a complex communication protocol&quot;.  &quot;Impose&quot; seems as if it's going
<br>
to require the existence of a physical model in order to be definable,
<br>
and the instincts need to operate prior to the physical model.  We want
<br>
benevolence to arise out of the nature of the AI, not to be something
<br>
imposed upon it.  Something that's imposed will be thrown off at some
<br>
later point as an invalid restriction.  Something that is a part of the
<br>
definition of &quot;who I am&quot; will not be opposed, because there will be no
<br>
desire to oppose it.
