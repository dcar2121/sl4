<em>&gt; Just say that a Sysop adopted <a href="mailto:m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20Imposing%20ideas,%20eg:%20morality">m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk</a> 's two axioms:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Prohibiting any action which affects another member of the group,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unless that member has wilfully expressed for that action to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allowed (a form of domain protection).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Nb: can you say &quot;Golden Rule&quot;?)
</em><br>
<p>Isn't the 'golden rule' from christianity? 'do unto others as you would have 
<br>
them do unto you'?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2. Giving all group members equal resource entitlement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you expect such a sysop to not only enforce the axioms directly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also for others to adhere to them where they were operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside the Sysop's influence?  
</em><br>
<p>Will there be anything outside the Sysop's influence? I severely doubt it, and 
<br>
if there was and this problem arrose, I would imagine the sysop merely 
<br>
extending said influence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As in, would you expect a Sysop to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow Robin to voluntarily accompany Leslie into the woods*
</em><br>
<p>'unless that member has wilfully expressed for that action to be allowed'
<br>
Yes, yes I would.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course the Sysop is going to influence others to adhere to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral axioms.  Leslie and Robins future actions might take place away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the Sysop's field of influence, but the Sysop will always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making actions that affect the future, because you can't make actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that affect the present!  (Insert TangentT here)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brief ad hominem interlude...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you expect others to respect your domain, what's that but a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality? 
</em><br>
<p>If you define it as such then I guess so - language isnt really good enough to 
<br>
express precisely what is meant in debates like this. The key factor is that I 
<br>
expect nothing on a moral basis, merely that this is what I see as the best 
<br>
state of affairs. Call my view an 'alternative morality' as opposed to 'moral 
<br>
nihilism' if you must - its semantics. The real (and entire) point behind this 
<br>
and my initial post is:
<br>
<p>Current morality is relative/does not exist (depends on precise definition of 
<br>
terms). It is a social construct which has been beneficial to most in the 
<br>
human era. In the posthuman era, it is unlikely to be beneficial, and it is 
<br>
also unlikely that (as no absolte morality) a single prescriptive morality 
<br>
imposed by a sysop would be optimal. Whilst idealy the best solution would be 
<br>
to allow each posthuman to develop his/her/its own moral system/lack thereof 
<br>
to live by, there will be more than one. As such a form of domain protection 
<br>
is required, but should be kept to an absolute minimum.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hell, you even suggest giving resources out equally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communist!  I happen to own large tracts of land that have more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1/6billionth of the planet's solar collection potential and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fossil energy reserves buried beneath.*  You ain't stealing my land/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy resources!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * This is a lie.  My point is that one 2006human's share of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth's crust is 85ha, less than what some people own.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but a sysop would have no trouble taking it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Back to sysops...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the sysop is vastly more powerful than other entities, it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to act in a genie-like way, and grants wishes that don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere with other human's &quot;domains&quot;.  Why should humans/post-humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be forced not to interfere with each others domains?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a Sysop, because &quot;might makes right&quot; ;P
</em><br>
<p>Yep. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Otherwise, because there might be some (objective?) reason not to.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, just the way I, and hopefully others, would prefer it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, why should the sysop not adversely affect humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because the Sysop's progenitors decided to make it that way.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
