<p><em>&gt; First important thing to understand is that a moral system is necessarily

</em><br>
<p>Yes, this duality -- subjective values, objective means -- is key.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; means that a rational agent can look at his moral system, whenever he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learns new information and find out that for example his system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-defeating (which would be a bad thing).
</em><br>
<p>We immediately run into a problem, because no agent has the god's-eye
<br>
view necessary to know whether its own system is actually improving or
<br>
&quot;self-defeating&quot;.  From its viewpoint within the system, it can not
<br>
distinguish between local maxima/minima and broader progress toward
<br>
its goals.  While there are known algorithms to expand the search,
<br>
such knowledge is fundamentally constrained due to limited
<br>
computational time and precision, and limited knowledge of the system
<br>
which can not be completely defined without also fully defining its
<br>
surrounding context (environment).
<br>
<p>This is not to say progress is impossible, only that its direction is
<br>
fundamentally uncertain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This kind of situation requires the agent to search for a better moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, which can either mean changing goals, values, or means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The next step: how should we change our goals or values, because as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, we get into an infinite recursion problem by doing that. The main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea in my opinion, is that the agent should calculate the future value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future agents actions based on its _current_ values and goals. Thus, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will only make such changes to my code, which result in actions and in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind which I, the current me, believes to maximize his own utility (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the utility of the future mind doing the actual decisions).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, value judgements are necessarily based on current, local, values,
<br>
but understood to be subject to update.  Our best guide is that those
<br>
values which have survived competition and are seen to work over
<br>
increasing scope tend to be seen as better in the long run.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One of the key things about utility theory is that utilities of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different minds cannot be directly compared. When we are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifications to our goal/value structure, we are changing the mind and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus the utilities of the future mind and current self cannot be directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared. The future mind's utility can only be part of the equation, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current mind cares about the future mind's utility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does this kind of reasoning help solve the problem of infinite recursion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were talking about? The current mind makes decisions that maximize its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility, even though it will never as such see the results of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizing. Instead it is somebody else, the future mind, who does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To avoid the paradox implied by a agent in the present taking actions
<br>
to increase utility for an agent existing in the future, it makes
<br>
sense to say that our moral imperative is to promote our values into
<br>
the future.  This handles the case of an agent doing things on behalf
<br>
of its future self (who doesn't yet exist) as well as an agent doing
<br>
things on behalf of others even if it may not survive to enjoy the
<br>
benefits.  Note that the agent acts to promote its subjective values,
<br>
it does not act to increase utility.
<br>
<p>Likewise on the objective side of the duality, instrumental knowledge
<br>
that survives competition and works over increasing scope will tend to
<br>
better promote ones values.  Therefore, greater good is achieved not
<br>
by working toward a fixed (or recursively updated) goal, but instead
<br>
by applying increasingly objective principles of what works toward
<br>
promotion of increasingly subjective values into the future.  Note
<br>
that the agent acts to promote its subjective values, but does not act
<br>
to achieve a specific goal (in a fundamentally uncertain, coevolving
<br>
environment.)
