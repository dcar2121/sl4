</em><br>
<p>Yes - this is why I did say that &quot;in part this is understandable&quot; in my 
<br>
original post.
<br>
<p>My criticism was not meant to encourage people to draw up exact 
<br>
accurate-to-the-hundredth-of-a-second estimates about when specific 
<br>
technologies will become available. Instead it was commenting on the 
<br>
fact that often, any estimates are either drawn up on an entirely 
<br>
arbitrary basis (&quot;in 20 years&quot; and &quot;in 50 years&quot; seem to be popular, 
<br>
good-sounding guesses) or just plain non-existent. It may be impossible 
<br>
to predict the arrival date of a certain technology to a year or even a 
<br>
decade, but that's hardly a valid excuse for not even *trying* to draw 
<br>
up rough estimates.
<br>
<p>The often quoted bit about computer processing power reaching the level 
<br>
of the human brain in 2020 or whatever is an example of an estimate 
<br>
that, while on pretty shaky ground, at least *tries* to project a rough 
<br>
date based on current data. Better yet might be providing an estimate on 
<br>
what sort of work still needs to be done on technology X:
<br>
<p>* How much has been shown to be possible in theory (the rough idea of 
<br>
strong AI, with the human brain being a proof of concept)
<br>
* How much has been implemented in theory (Drexler's Nanosystems has 
<br>
extensive analyses about nanotech arguing for its feasibility and 
<br>
implementations, but so far we don't have the technology to actually 
<br>
start testing the theory directly)
<br>
* If there are theoretical implementations, what needs to be achieved 
<br>
before we can start testing them
<br>
* How much has been actually implemented, either directly or in other 
<br>
applications that just need some engineering work to modify (there 
<br>
aren't, AFAIK, any nuclear-powered airplanes in existence, but nuclear 
<br>
reactors in general have been widely implemented and it wouldn't be a 
<br>
large step to build such an airplane if we for some bizarre reason 
<br>
wanted to)
<br>
* Where don't we have theoretical implementations, but are confident 
<br>
that research currently in progress will soon help us come up with some 
<br>
(and why)
<br>
* What are we still entirely clueless about implementing
<br>
<p>And so on. This'd probably be better in that it estimates technologies 
<br>
in terms of things yet to be developed (and may even help directing the 
<br>
research efforts) instead of attempting to project an arbitrary date 
<br>
exactly. One could also use *this* analysis to provide (very rough) date 
<br>
projections - or simply state that there are still too many holes to 
<br>
make predictions with any reasonable accuracy. In any case, it would be 
<br>
better than simply saying &quot;no idea&quot; without even trying to do any 
<br>
analysis, or saying &quot;20 to 50 years&quot; because it happens to sound good, 
<br>
like often
<br>
<p>Foresight's Nanotechnology Roadmap ( <a href="http://physorg.com/news4656.html">http://physorg.com/news4656.html</a> ) 
<br>
would seem, from what I can gather from the press release, like one 
<br>
example of such an analysis.
