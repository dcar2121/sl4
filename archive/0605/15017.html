</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
That's self-contradictory and confused.
<br>
<p>(1) So what if people believe their relative morality to be objective? 
<br>
That people are stupid, confused or mistaught is not actually helpful to 
<br>
deciding the issue. Their moralities remain in fact relative, and what 
<br>
they believe about their objectivity is irrelevant.
<br>
(2) If we can make an AI follow imposed moral goals as if they were 
<br>
objective, then morality is not by definition relative. We will have 
<br>
just disproved that with an example. Instead, morality may at least 
<br>
sometimes be objective, and we may proceed to deciding whether we should 
<br>
impose our morality on an AGI, and in what way.
<br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As you can see, this problem boils down to two things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   (a)  Debates about morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   (b)  Understanding AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I suggest that (a) is not SL4 or easily solvable, and that (b) is what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should concern ourself with?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, we work on how to build an AGI, and how to make it follow a 'morality'. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then we let someone else decide what that morality should be. Sounds clever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Hmmm, irony. I think you should try using this less, and making more of 
<br>
an effort to understand what  I'm on about. The question about how to 
<br>
make an AGI follow a morality is the problem which must be solved first. 
<br>
I think it's clear that any debate about AGI morality needs to be 
<br>
informed by the nature of that AGI and the nature of morality. There is 
<br>
no shortage of philosophical discussion about the nature of morality as 
<br>
such. In order to contribute anything new to the philosophical debate, 
<br>
we must introduce new concepts, such as how an AGI morality may be 
<br>
constituted, before we may be regarded as saying anything useful.
<br>
<p>I don't think any of the debate so far has done so.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
