So, it seems like that's a definite maybe.
<br>
<p>Seriously, I am not at all sure that such things truly play on free will 
<br>
or not. I've come to look at free will in a different way -- that one 
<br>
cannot predict my decisions considering my brain as a black box, and 
<br>
considering only its genetic history and exposure to the world. The fact 
<br>
is, the state of my mind cannot be dictated solely by those things.
<br>
<p>The fact that my mind runs on rules doesn't really bother me. I think I 
<br>
have to just shrug and get on with life. No theory of physics includes 
<br>
consciousness, so whatever the mind is, its mysteries are not going to 
<br>
be dissolved by scientific theories which do not explicitly address it. 
<br>
The miracle of consciousness remains a miracle regardless of whether 
<br>
randomness is present in the universe or not. What kind of freedom is 
<br>
randomness anyway?
<br>
<p>I think that people who use determinism and indeterminism as the sole 
<br>
basis for arguments about free will fail to understand the question.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>

<em>&gt; &quot;Loading the dice against free will:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A battle is waging in physics that could strip us of all sense of personal

<em>&gt; responsibility&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Bryan Appleyard

<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many angels can dance on the head of a pin? Tricky. Was it inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I should write this and that, now, you should be reading it? Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trickier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The angels-pin question was originally posed as a joke. It lampooned the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arcane and futile speculations of medieval theologians. They pondered the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of the world on the basis of faith and, in our terms, profound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorance. We have hard science. We have moved beyond such nonsense. Or have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gerard ’t Hooft of Utrecht University is one of the world’s great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicists. In 1999, along with Martin Veltman, he won the Nobel prize “for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions in physics”.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, like all physicists, he has a problem, a problem so huge that, daily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it threatens to undermine the entire fabric of his discipline.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is complex — some say it is beyond solution by the human mind —
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it can be simply stated. Relativity and quantum theory are the two great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triumphs of modern physics. The first explains the behaviour of very big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things like planets, the second the behaviour of very small things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subatomic particles. They both lie, currently, beyond refutation. Planets do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behave as relativity predicts and subatomic particles obey quantum theory —
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they didn’t I couldn’t now be writing this on a computer and you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be able to watch the World Cup on television.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that they contradict each other. Relativity is a “classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory”, it can be demonstrated to act through known processes of cause and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect. Quantum theory is not. Subatomic particles behave like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schizophrenics on acid. They seem to be telling us that the world is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeterminate, unpredictable and completely lacking in anything resembling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our common-sense understanding of cause and effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Einstein hated this, arguing that “God does not play dice”. There must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something we didn’t know, some “hidden variables” that lay behind quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena that would, one day, return the quantum world safely to the bosom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of classical physics. To which the quantum theorists’ response is: God does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not play dice but only because he runs the casino. The indeterminacy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum phenomena is real and final, it is just the way the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made. Enter ’t Hooft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He has just published a paper arguing that, in effect, Einstein was right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are recognisable systems of cause and effect underlying quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions. There is a hidden reality which consists of “states” that do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behave deterministically. We don’t see them because they are so small and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because their actions are very brief. What we see is only an outcome that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears to have no cause.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, over at Princeton University, two of the world’s great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematicians, John Conway and Simon Kochen, have produced another paper —
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Free Will Theorem — arguing exactly the opposite: that the world is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed finally and absolutely indeterminate.
