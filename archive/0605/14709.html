Michael:
<br>
I agree -- AGI and nanotech are possible. You said, &quot;They are possible and
<br>
so will eventually happen.&quot;  Since we haven't gotten there yet, don't we
<br>
need to worry about some speed-of-light or Heisenberg's Uncertainty problem?
<br>
That is, some physical obstacle that simply can't be crossed?  Maybe we're
<br>
in agreement -- AGI and nanotech seem a lot more possible than teleporters.
<br>
But I wonder how we tell possible (just not here yet) problems from fanciful
<br>
(and may not get here ever) problems.  For example, AGI has certainly proved
<br>
a lot more tricky than we expected, given early successes.
<br>
<p>As for your point about experts vs. futurists, I've seen lots of predictions
<br>
that have failed, but maybe that wasn't the experts talking.  Still, it
<br>
seems to me that we can find lots of expert predictions over the last
<br>
century or so that were laughably wrong.
<br>
<p>&quot;Do you think that progress will stop just for this generation?&quot;  Certainly
<br>
not.  However, I don't think progress is exponential (Kurweil's Law of
<br>
Accelerating Returns, for example) since it never has been.  IMO, the rate
<br>
of technological change in the West has been roughly constant since the
<br>
Industrial Revolution.
<br>
<p>To respond to your earlier email, you said, &quot;If only the general populace
<br>
understood how close we were and the potential of these technologies. If
<br>
only Bob. And you can define &quot;close&quot; as anything you like.  Even a couple of
<br>
centuries is close, though I see it as a couple of decades until the full
<br>
bloom of the aforementioned technologies.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you define &quot;close&quot; as a couple of centuries, then I'm right with you.
<br>
However, I'm pessimistic about seeing the full bloom of AGI, nanotech, and
<br>
so on in just 20 years.
<br>
<p>Regardless, we've got front row seats.  Should be an interesting show!

Subject: RE: Anti-singularity spam.
<br>
<p>Some people answered to your questions Bob, but let me give it to you in my
<br>
own simple way. And afterwards maybe you can respond to my doubts, on my
<br>
previous mail, about your assumptions on the average person's view of
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p>On the matter of inevitability: I don't even want to imagine that you imply
<br>
that AGI and nanotech are impossible. To do so would mean that you are
<br>
totally ignorant on basic physics and chemistry and that you probably
<br>
believe in the divine uniqeness of the human species, the eternal soul or
<br>
something equally delusional. They are possible and so will eventually
<br>
happen. Unless we crowl back to our caves, or the End comes, of course (and
<br>
don't even go there, it's pointless).
<br>
<p>On the matter of proximity: you need only be informed and follow current
<br>
technologies. Talk to the experts, listen to what they have to say. To the
<br>
experts in each field, not to futurists. It's an informed guess, I guess.
<br>
Ask some people here if they think they will make an AGI in their lifetime.
<br>
Sure, as an average Joe, I heard it first from futurists such as yourself,
<br>
albeit more optimistic ones, but without crossreferencing a few dozen times
<br>
and applying hard logic you shouldn't believe what anybody says (including
<br>
your own self :) ).
<br>
<p>Finally: AGI and nanotechnology are not products, Bob.
<br>
They are not the PC that is giving you a hard time.
<br>
They are part of progress. You know, from kite, to baloon, to plane, to
<br>
spaceship. From large scale, to small scale, to even smaller scale. From
<br>
abacus, to computer, to really really really smart computer.
<br>
<p>Do you think that progress will stop just for this generation?
<br>

<em>&gt; Bob,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The majority of the population sees nanotechnology, renewable energy, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI even AI and biotech as sci-fi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If only the general populace understood how close we were and the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even a couple of centuries is close, though I see it as a couple of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; PC, internet, cellular phones. That's about it for the average Joe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;things to come&quot; haven't had an impact on every day life yet and
