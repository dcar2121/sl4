Damien: You raise a good point.  Specific predictions are often wrong
<br>
(&quot;We'll be using beams of light to send telephone signals wirelessly by
<br>
1990&quot;), but the general idea (we'll have wireless telephony by the late 20th
<br>
century) is often correct.  Eliezer's observation that &quot;Careful futurism is
<br>
rarely popular, popular futurism is rarely careful&quot; is excellent.
<br>
<p>My concern: where does this stop?  Do you give a pass to the 1930s
<br>
predictions of fleets of zeppelins because we *did* get fleets of airplanes?
<br>
Or of 1950s predictions of huge nuclear-powered oil tanker submarines
<br>
because we have oil tanker ships?  If your criteria for success is wide
<br>
enough, lots of things will pass.  Perhaps the question is: if you take what
<br>
eventually happened and show it to the original predictors, would they be
<br>
satisfied or surprised?  I simply want to hold futurists accountable rather
<br>
than bending over backwards and saying that they were right in spirit even
<br>
if laughably off in fact.

<p>Don't you see how ludicrous this comparison is? Why not go the whole hog and
<br>
mock the absence of gigantic zeppelins cruising the skies at an amazing 120
<br>
m.p.h.!! The immense wooden sailing craft that could circle the world in
<br>
only months!!!
<br>
<p>We don't have moon bases for the same reason we're not recovering from spasm
<br>
nuclear war, another frequent image in '50s sf. It turned out not to be good
<br>
strategy. Bear in mind that Clarke's idea for geostationary radio sats were
<br>
vast objects filled with human switch-board operators. The difference
<br>
between then and now is precisely the driver that pushes the singularity.
<br>
Instead of monkeys in local space, we have light-weight, powerful probes to
<br>
the edge of the solar system sending back scads of images and data. Instead
<br>
of large fixed videophones, we have thin pocket cellphones that take pix and
<br>
transmit them instantly to anywhere in the world. The hazard of prediction
<br>
isn't overheated imagination--it's an inevitable failure to see how
<br>
realistic goals will be attained by other, more technically advanced means,
<br>
and that indeed some goals will be abandoned as foolish, short-sighted and
<br>
wasteful.
<br>
<p>MNT might turn out to be accomplished by tweaked RNA rather than
<br>
mechanosynthesis, but if the end result realizes our wishes, so what?
<br>
<p>Your critique of Sunday journalist &quot;futurism&quot; is accurate, but nobody in
<br>
this forum needs to be told that. If you wish to reprove Vernor Vinge, say,
<br>
for his lack of understanding, you'll need to address his now-classic
<br>
arguments from 20 years ago concerning the likely impacts of
<br>
self-incrementing AI (whenever it happens). It's interesting that Vinge's
<br>
name doesn't appear even once in the index of FUTURE HYPE, nor does
<br>
&quot;technological singularity&quot;. Nor, for that matter, does Yudkowsky's. It's
<br>
time to stop taking pot-shots at the lazy anoxic fish in the brine barrel
<br>
and go instead after the big sharks.
