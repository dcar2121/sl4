<em>&gt;From Eliezer S. Yudkowsky:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what evidence is there that anyone *can* draw up such rough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimates, accurately?  It would be nice to have them, yes; but what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes you think they're available?
</em><br>
<p>...I thought I already covered this in the rest of my mail?
<br>
<p>It's perfectly acceptable if there isn't enough information to draw up 
<br>
even a rough roadmap of the things still to be done - of course, if 
<br>
there isn't enough information to estimate even *that*, then it's 
<br>
probably pretty good evidence of technology X still being a looong time 
<br>
away (for how can one research anything if they don't even know what to 
<br>
research for it?). And, of course, it's also entirely understandable if 
<br>
somebody just plain doesn't know enough of the field to make up such 
<br>
roadmaps - but in that case they shouldn't be saying that the technology 
<br>
is 5-20 years away in the first place.
<br>
<p>The &quot;I really know nothing about this but we'll have thing X in 20 
<br>
years&quot; with X being just about every transhuman tech imaginable is the 
<br>
main thing I was objecting to, more so than just saying &quot;no clue&quot;. (As 
<br>
could be seen from the context, since the sentiment I was supporting was 
<br>
originally aimed towards the poster who said we'd have nanotech in 5 
<br>
years)
