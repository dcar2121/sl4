<br>
<em>&gt; Crockners Rules
</em><br>
Nice to know. Same apply to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've been lurking for a while, and the one thing that has really struck me
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; that whilst a (largely commendable) near worship of rationality exists on
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; SL4 list, this has a huge blindspot. Everyone cleaves nearly
</em><br>
unquestioningly
<br>
<em>&gt; to wider societies superstitious moralism.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are mistaken. There's quite a variety of opinions on the matter
<br>
of ethics and morality on the list, from those who believe there is an
<br>
objective morality, to those who, like you, believe that there's nothing
<br>
there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. Compassion, gene driven animal emotion - evolved to further cooperation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between people - thus increasing chances of survival.
</em><br>
<p>Check. Note though that increasing chances of survival is not teleological
<br>
as much as consequential. Id est, compassion and the like appear, to the
<br>
right extent and in the right forms, to have survival value. Perhaps you
<br>
should consider that for a bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. Social conformity - again a gene driven animal instinct.
</em><br>
<p>Partly gene-driven, probably. Social comformity might also derive from
<br>
culture or reasoned stances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Societal brainwashing.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I see a disjunction between categories 2 and 3.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Morality is completely artificial. Right and Wrong either do not exist, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't matter other than in the qualia that they cause the person who
</em><br>
believes
<br>
<em>&gt; he is acting wrongly/rightly - depending on your exact definition of
</em><br>
terms.
<br>
<p>You're assuming qualia matter. That's an interesting yet controversial
<br>
point.
<br>
Also completely artificial is an improperly phrased criticism, even if I
<br>
think I know what you mean. Mathematics is, or might be anyway, completely
<br>
artificial. The sciences are completely artificial. Language is completely
<br>
artificial. I'd say these things matter. Artificial is not a signifier of
<br>
worth. More importantly, as you point out above, morality has pretty clear
<br>
genetic bases, which are not artificial (unless evolution is an artificer).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It could be argued that in some cases, acting morally benefits he/she who
</em><br>
does
<br>
<em>&gt; so due to reciprocity - but this is only in some cases and this course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action could be entirely derived from self-interest by moral nihilists.
</em><br>
<p>How so? A moral nihilist does not believe that any action is preferrable to
<br>
any other action in terms of moral content. Why would a moral nihilist argue
<br>
for cooperative constructive behaviour that benefits individuals?
<br>
Self-interest is as artificial (far more) than evolved morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously, the first 2 points are a part of us - so suspending ones
</em><br>
disbelief
<br>
<em>&gt; concerning morality in everyday life may well lead to a happier more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfilling human life. However, once radical transhuman technologies
</em><br>
arrive,
<br>
<em>&gt; this will no-longer be nescissarilly true.
</em><br>
<p>It depends on what ways people choose to self-modify. I would argue that
<br>
some form of ethos is going to have to be kept, unless we want to have
<br>
serious trouble in the mid term. It would probably be a lot cleaner in terms
<br>
of referential transparency and such than evolved morality, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As such, when considering/planning posthumanity we should reject
</em><br>
traditional
<br>
<em>&gt; morality and embrace moral nihilism. This is as the potential gain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthumanity (and acting entirely rationally when planning/considering
</em><br>
it - to
<br>
<em>&gt; ensure the best outcome) far outweighs the positive qualia felt by being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassionate when considering posthumanity.
</em><br>
<p>This is the imo most misguided part of your post. You've just used a should.
<br>
Aren't you shooting yourself in the foot?
<br>
Also, I don't clearly see why moral nihilism is a necessary condition for
<br>
post-humanity. (And playing the nihilist's advocate, why we should care
<br>
about the gains (gains? stop the value judgements right there!) of
<br>
post-humanity.)
<br>
