Quoting John K Clark &lt;<a href="mailto:jonkc@att.net?Subject=Re:%20ESSAY:%20Forward%20Moral%20Nihilism">jonkc@att.net</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;<a href="mailto:m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20ESSAY:%20Forward%20Moral%20Nihilism">m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suspending ones disbelief concerning morality in everyday life may well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lead to a happier more fulfilling human life. However, once radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhuman  technologies arrive, this will no-longer be nescissarilly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would think that for a transhuman morality would be even more important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it is for us. If you are a Jupiter brain it would be critical to have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good relationship with other Jupiter brains as a war between them would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely be rather unpleasant for them and anything else in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that it will be very unlikely that there will be multiple 
<br>
transhumans of anywhere near the same level (at least at the top level) of 
<br>
power/intelligence - the most powerful would never let anyone else catch up. 
<br>
Morality for cooperation will be unnesscissary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I define nihilist as 'one who holds no belief however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; widespread, not supported by proof'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to believe that your existence is better than your nonexistence,
</em><br>
<p>Not really, but not the other way either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and I'll bet you believe pleasure is better than pain, but I've not seen any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof of that.
</em><br>
<p>Depends what you mean by better. I know i dont like pain, and i like pleasure -
<br>
the proof of this comes from my memory of my qualia and also my knowledge of 
<br>
anatomy, evolutionary psycology etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A moral nihilist could have all your pleasurable states of mind by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recognising this (as I do) and suspending his disbelief most of the time -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without cleaving blindly to moralistic dogma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That could be the explanation of the Fermi Paradox, the reason we can't find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any ET's. If it were possible to change your emotions to anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted, alter modes of thought, radically change your personality, swap your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals as well as your philosophy of life at the drop of a hat it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very dangerous. Once you change yourself you may not want to change back,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if your behavior became bizarre or suicidal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ever want to accomplish something but been unable to because it's difficult,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well just change your goal in life to something simple and do that; better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet, flood your mind with a feeling of pride and self satisfaction and don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother accomplishing anything at all. Think all this is a terrible idea and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid as well, no problem, just change your mind (and I do mean CHANGE YOUR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MIND) now you think it's a wonderful idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Complex mechanisms don't do well in positive feedback loops, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electronics, not animals, not people, not ET's and not even Jupiter brains.
</em><br>
<p>I was talking about in life now - pre-singularity.
<br>
Though once ccomplete mental revision becomes possible: Providing that doing 
<br>
so does not give someone else the power over you required to induce negative 
<br>
qualia i dont see what the problem would be.
