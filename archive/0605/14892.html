<p><em>&gt; From: &lt;<a href="mailto:m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk?Subject=Re:%20ESSAY:%20Forward%20Moral%20Nihilism">m.l.vere@durham.ac.uk</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Crockners Rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nice to know. Same apply to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've been lurking for a while, and the one thing that has really struck me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that whilst a (largely commendable) near worship of rationality exists on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; SL4 list, this has a huge blindspot. Everyone cleaves nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unquestioningly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to wider societies superstitious moralism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are mistaken. There's quite a variety of opinions on the matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ethics and morality on the list, from those who believe there is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective morality, to those who, like you, believe that there's nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.
</em><br>
<p>Huh, has someone already presented my argument?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Compassion, gene driven animal emotion - evolved to further cooperation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between people - thus increasing chances of survival.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Check. Note though that increasing chances of survival is not teleological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as much as consequential. Id est, compassion and the like appear, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right extent and in the right forms, to have survival value. Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should consider that for a bit.
</em><br>
<p>I have. In the posthuman world cooperation will be far less (and perhaps not 
<br>
at all) nescissary for survival. Either because of the enormous power 
<br>
differentials which will exist between posthuman entities or because (an IMO 
<br>
favourable) sysop would make it unnessicssary - a choice instead of a 
<br>
necessity. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2. Social conformity - again a gene driven animal instinct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Partly gene-driven, probably. Social comformity might also derive from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture or reasoned stances.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, the former would be my third point, the latter i believe to be rare 
<br>
and where it does exist something addopted on a case by case basis with the 
<br>
motivation of self interest, as opposed to an assumption underlying life. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3. Societal brainwashing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I see a disjunction between categories 2 and 3.
</em><br>
<p>2 is what people do naturally - coppying peer of their own volition. 3 is what 
<br>
schools/parents drum repeatedly into children.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Morality is completely artificial. Right and Wrong either do not exist, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't matter other than in the qualia that they cause the person who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he is acting wrongly/rightly - depending on your exact definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're assuming qualia matter. That's an interesting yet controversial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also completely artificial is an improperly phrased criticism, even if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think I know what you mean. Mathematics is, or might be anyway, completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial. The sciences are completely artificial. Language is completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial. I'd say these things matter. Artificial is not a signifier of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth. More importantly, as you point out above, morality has pretty clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic bases, which are not artificial (unless evolution is an artificer).
</em><br>
<p>Just making the point that morality is nothing more than a social construct - 
<br>
IMO better trancended in the posthuman era.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It could be argued that in some cases, acting morally benefits he/she who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so due to reciprocity - but this is only in some cases and this course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action could be entirely derived from self-interest by moral nihilists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How so? A moral nihilist does not believe that any action is preferrable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other action in terms of moral content. Why would a moral nihilist argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for cooperative constructive behaviour that benefits individuals?
</em><br>
<p>Because it would benefit him/her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Self-interest is as artificial (far more) than evolved morality.
</em><br>
<p>Eh? Morality is not evolved, it is a social construct. Beoing natural is not 
<br>
my ultimate objective, the best way i can see is self-interest, with suspended 
<br>
disbelief and indulging compassion/social conformity when one rationally 
<br>
belives that this serves self interest. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Obviously, the first 2 points are a part of us - so suspending ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disbelief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concerning morality in everyday life may well lead to a happier more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fulfilling human life. However, once radical transhuman technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this will no-longer be nescissarilly true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It depends on what ways people choose to self-modify. I would argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some form of ethos is going to have to be kept, unless we want to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious trouble in the mid term. It would probably be a lot cleaner in terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of referential transparency and such than evolved morality, though.
</em><br>
<p>'Keeping some form of ethos' ensures a sub-optimal posthumanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As such, when considering/planning posthumanity we should reject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality and embrace moral nihilism. This is as the potential gain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; posthumanity (and acting entirely rationally when planning/considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it - to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ensure the best outcome) far outweighs the positive qualia felt by being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compassionate when considering posthumanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the imo most misguided part of your post. You've just used a should.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aren't you shooting yourself in the foot?
</em><br>
<p>Bah, semantics. I consider it preferable that people share/hear my views and 
<br>
used part of moral language to expalin them. I say that this course of action 
<br>
would be preferable in terms of achieving the optimum posthuman qualia. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I don't clearly see why moral nihilism is a necessary condition for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-humanity. (And playing the nihilist's advocate, why we should care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the gains (gains? stop the value judgements right there!) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-humanity.)
</em><br>
<p>Its not nescissary - just makes it better. There are several different 
<br>
definitions of nihlist. The one I go by is 'someone who accepts no doctrine, 
<br>
however widespread, not supported by proof' - in this case absolute morality. 
<br>
I want gains because I (will) like them.
