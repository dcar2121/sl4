<p><p>Unfortunately no. Us computer and space people are prone to thinking that,

because we don't want to acknowledge the complexities involved; to get a
<br>
more realistic picture, you need to talk to mining and manufacturing people.
<br>
Here's an example of the feedback when someone (Monte Davis, on
<br>
sci.space.policy) did:
<br>
<p><a href="http://groups.google.ie/group/sci.space.policy/msg/8c008c8ded5217b2?hl=en">http://groups.google.ie/group/sci.space.policy/msg/8c008c8ded5217b2?hl=en</a>&amp;
<br>
<p>I don't know if that link will work correctly, so I'll copy:
<br>
<p>&quot;One useful first-cut distinction is that between processing
<br>
gases/liquids and processing inhomogeneous solids, where mechanical
<br>
engineering issues loom much larger. I've been watching ideas for use
<br>
of _in situ_ resources since the 1970s space manufacturing
<br>
conferences, and have often run them by acquaintances who work in
<br>
mining, refining and process engineering.
<br>
<p>Talk to them about Zubrin's scheme for automated processing of Martian
<br>
atmosphere, or even (farther along) &quot;scooping&quot; from gas giants,  and
<br>
they say &quot;maybe&quot; (with caveats about how reliable valves, compressors,
<br>
etc, would have to be).
<br>
&nbsp;Talk to them about handling kilotons of lunar regolith per month with
<br>
robots, telepresence, or a small handful of astronauts (who presumably
<br>
have a lot else to attend to)... using equipment that fits within
<br>
near-term mass constraints of lunar landing...  and they laugh out
<br>
loud. With all due respect, Alex, have you ever actually witnessed the
<br>
start-up of a mine, cement plant, brick factory or the like?&quot;
<br>
<p>We're not just many steps, or even many major breakthroughs in AI, short of
<br>
that capability; we're many whole epochs of technology short of it.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to be a wet blanket - I think it can be done, given enough
<br>
time; I'm trying to figure out how to make the next major breakthrough. But
<br>
the difficulty of the task looks almost limitless, and the time available
<br>
looks anything but. That's why I think while studying existential questions
<br>
of the distant future is interesting and fun, the important problem facing
<br>
our generation is how to make progress _fast_ enough, while the window of
<br>
opportunity is still open.
