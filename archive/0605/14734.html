Eliezer: You're very skeptical of future predictions.  Sounds good to me.
<br>
But tell me what we should do about the situation we find ourselves in.
<br>
There are lots of irresponsible predictions, and the public buys them.  They
<br>
figure, &quot;Well, this person knows more than I do, so what choice do I have
<br>
but believe it?&quot;  Should we sound the alarm?  If not, is that because it
<br>
doesn't matter if the public is deluded or because we're powerless to do
<br>
anything?
<br>
<p>How do you respond to Kurzweil's predictions?  (I don't mean to pick on him,
<br>
but he seems to me to have the highest profile at the moment.)  Does he
<br>
follow the Way or is he a loose cannon?
<br>

</em><br>
<p>That is *not* the distinction I'm trying to make.  My distinction is between
<br>
people who are very careful about what they predict, and people who are
<br>
telling stories.  Telling stories is a very ancient human habit. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as we know, it goes back to the dawn of human intelligence. 
<br>
Science is a recent invention, and it did have to be invented.
<br>
<p>People who are highly skilled in a specific field, such as designing
<br>
computer chips, may not know the *separate and distinct* skills of
<br>
rationality required to realize *how difficult* it is to make a forecast 20
<br>
years out.  They may not realize that their skill at designing chips does
<br>
not extend to predicting the factors of psychology, economics, and sheer
<br>
random chance that determine real-world events in 20 years.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Let me ask another way: what predictions (or predictors) do you favor
</em><br>
today?
<br>
<em> &gt; Who is in a position to know and is giving reliable forecasts of what's
</em><br>
to  &gt; come in the area of AGI?
<br>
<p>The default answer is NO ONE.  Anyone who wants to stake the surprising
<br>
claim that some specific facet of the unvisited and unseen future is
<br>
predictable, carries the burden of proof.
<br>
<p>This is not a sports game.  I don't have to pick a team.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for AGI, maybe I've just been duped by predictions in newspaper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stories and missed those by people who should know.  We had Newell and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simon the the 50s, fresh from the success of their General Problem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solver, predicting big things for AI (and quickly).  They certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had me going.  Was it wrong to listen to them?
</em><br>
<p>By default, yes.  If you listened to them, you ought to be able to explain
<br>
why.  Or were you hearkening with awestruck ears to the words of a Great and
<br>
Eminent Priest, rather than evaluating the one's arguments?
<br>
<p>Let me put it another way:  *Rationality works.*
<br>
<p>It's very hard to use correctly, but when you use it correctly, it should
<br>
*work*, not fail.
<br>
<p>The novice makes a mistake and says, &quot;The Art failed me.&quot;
<br>
The expert makes a mistake and says, &quot;I failed my Art.&quot;
<br>
<p>You seem to be thinking that it was perfectly all right for you to believe
<br>
Newell and Simon.  And yet, this led you to an incorrect answer. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hint that you - and they - did something wrong.  The true Way
<br>
should not fail you.  This doesn't mean that the true Way can predict the
<br>
future - but the true Way ought to indicate correctly when you are ignorant;
<br>
it should not give you strongly confident predictions of a wrong answer.
