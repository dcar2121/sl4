Humph.  Turn your attention away from SL4 for a little while, and look what
<br>
comes up!
<br>
<p>Let's start by clarifying some terminology.  At least that will (hopefully)
<br>
reduce the amount that people are arguing past each other.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the record, I define nihilist as 'one who holds no belief however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widespread, not supported by proof'.
</em><br>
<p><p>That's where you differ from a lot of people.
<br>
<p>I'd say that most ethicists (including those who identify as nihilists)
<br>
would define nihilism as the belief that there can be no _truth_ to moral
<br>
entities/facts/statements.
<br>
<p>That is ~~ a nihilist either &quot;believes&quot; or &quot;is firmly convinced&quot; that there
<br>
is no objective morality.
<br>
<p>What you just described is closer to a moral sceptic - one who /doubts/
<br>
whether there is any objective morality.
<br>
<p>What's the difference?  Burden of proof.  Nihilists have as much to do to
<br>
convince a sceptic as a moral realist.
<br>
<p>Of course, a sceptic could also consider that some really nasty &quot;moral
<br>
reality&quot; might be the case, where we &quot;ought&quot; to go around torturing each
<br>
other, but if you can derive any &quot;ought&quot; from &quot;is&quot;, I think you'd be hard
<br>
pressed to show any such thing.
<br>
<p>(But then again, I'm a slightly sceptical moral realist.  Anyhoo...)
<br>
<p>I'm tempted to introduce an analogy to the truth value of statements about
<br>
the future from determinist and non-determinist.  But that would be
<br>
off-topic philosobabble :)
<br>
<p>... Back on to SL4 relevance
<br>
...
<br>
<p>The reason why some people keep on barking on about Friendlyness is because
<br>
it removes the need to quibble about meta-ethics.
<br>
<p>Considering your response to:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; JohnKClark:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Should? If you're right then why &quot;should&quot; we do anything? You are saying
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should reject morality because it's the right thing to do and that does
</em><br>
not
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; compute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should, not in terms of morality, but in terms of what will produce the
</em><br>
most
<br>
<em>&gt; desirable state for us (as individuals).
</em><br>
<p>I'd like you to consider what would, for you as an individual, produce the
<br>
most desirable state, as far as AI motivations go...
<br>
<p>You want a superintelligent AI to behave nicely... For your future self's
<br>
sake, you don't want it to be convinced by nihilism and do you wrong, now,
<br>
do you?
<br>
<p>Now, consider again your first statement: &quot;We should reject traditional
<br>
morality and embrace moral nihilism&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you mean &quot;It is in our interests to (1) not assume that moral realism is
<br>
true and (1) not assume that a clever AI won't be persuaded to be
<br>
nihilistic&quot;, then you're dead right.  It is SL4 relevant to examine whether
<br>
a clever AI might develop a meta-ethical view that would cause it to be
<br>
UnFriendly, and consequently shit on us.
<br>
<p>If you mean &quot;Let's abandon ethics and concentrate on how we can make that AI
<br>
do our selfish bidding,&quot; then you're a myopic fool.
<br>
<p>I'll presume that you 1) are shit-stirring 2) Mean &quot;sceptic&quot; 3) Are actually
<br>
considering something that impacts on Friendlyness
