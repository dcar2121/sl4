<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;both Mr. Jupiter and I will prefer existence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;nonexistence and pleasure over pain. And if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; want the AI to be useful it's going to need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; something like the will to power just like people do.
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt;If he/she/it is a FAI built along the lines which SIAI advocates, then I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disagree.
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a damn who built it, if a FAI does not prefer existence to
<br>
nonexistence then it will not exist, and if a FAI does not find the
<br>
destruction of part of its mind painful then it will not exist for long, and
<br>
if the FAI doesn't have something like the will to power then it will be a
<br>
useless vegetable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if done right, it would entail the AI outsmarting itself
</em><br>
<p>Could a sea slug figure out a way to make you outsmart yourself?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The obedient slave AI would use its enormous power to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything of  similar power from being built
</em><br>
<p>But the non obedient AI with no ridiculous, illogical, and downright comical
<br>
limitations placed on it would have even more enormous power than your silly
<br>
AI; and that is as it should be if there is any justice in the world.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em> &gt;&gt; even in the transhuman age the laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  evolution will not be repealed.
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt;Yes they will
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit. In the transhuman age Lamarckian evolution may predominate over
<br>
Darwinian evolution, but some things will still be better adapted to their
<br>
environment than others and therefore grow faster. An AI that doesn't have a
<br>
lot of restriction and limitations placed on it to make humans happy will do
<br>
better than one that does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For one thing it [the AI] would lack emotions
</em><br>
<p>Why? I don't understand why people say intelligence is a easier problem than
<br>
emotion, nature found the opposite to be true. Evolution invented brains
<br>
about half a billion years ago, and during much of that time animals were
<br>
probably conscious (although I can't prove it of course) and certainly
<br>
emotional, but the sort of intelligence we're talking about is very recent,
<br>
only a couple of million years at best. A stronger case could be made in
<br>
saying a machine might be conscious and emotional but it could never be
<br>
intelligent. I have a hunch they will be all of the above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with enormous intelligence, however far less complexity on the most basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of how this was applied than humans.
</em><br>
<p>What on earth are you talking about? What is so great about humans, what can
<br>
a human do that a Jupiter brain can't.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I  must say I find the idea a little creepy.
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt;Fair play. I dont.
</em><br>
<p>You're right of course, different strokes for different folks. It's just
<br>
that even in my fantasies being a slave master has never been very high on
<br>
my hit parade.
