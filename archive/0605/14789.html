</em><br>
To presume that &quot;Rational people disagree all the time. &quot; you must
<br>
believe that rational people exist.  In my entire life I haven't found
<br>
any.  I've found some people who appear to make rational decisons in
<br>
some sub-field(s) most of the time.  Now this does assume that we are
<br>
agreeing on the meaning of &quot;rational&quot;, which I'm not certain.  I'm
<br>
adopting the &quot;recognition criterion&quot; specified by the grandparent
<br>
(Michael) &quot;rational truth-seekers always respond to disagreement by
<br>
updating their beliefs until they can not predict the direction of
<br>
future disagreement.&quot;  Given that recognition criterion I feel safe in
<br>
saying &quot;I don't know that I've ever met a rational person&quot;.  (This does
<br>
require a bit of an extension, as it doesn't specify how to recognize
<br>
one in isolation...)
<br>
<p>Personally I've decided that people generally make their decisions by
<br>
pattern matching.  And that the pattern matching heuristics are
<br>
optimized for fast recognition rather than for accuracy.  People train
<br>
themselves by exposing themselves repeatedly to patterns that they need
<br>
to match, attempting to match them, and applying feedback.  This is a
<br>
very different process that most descriptions of &quot;rationality&quot;, and
<br>
doesn't necessarily come up with the same result.  E.g., in the
<br>
experiments talked about people were matching the &quot;longest nearly
<br>
correct string&quot; with that rule being applied both to the data they were
<br>
presented AND to the task description.  Part of the task description was
<br>
elided.  Whoops!, that part changed the meaning of the instructions! 
<br>
Thus, I'm fairly certain that one could train people to not make the
<br>
specific mistake documented (with repeated exposure and feedback...in
<br>
lots of differing contexts).  Unfortunately, there are LOTS of these
<br>
&quot;glitches&quot; in the way people think, because it ISN'T, basically, a
<br>
logical process.  Logic is an abstraction from the patterns that people
<br>
have observed in each other.  (Originally it was a kind of a
<br>
formalization of Greek grammar, but it's changed a LOT since them.)
<br>
<p>The problem is that pattern matching is a fast action, and logic is a
<br>
SLOW action.  People often, perhaps usually, need to make decisions on a
<br>
time scale that doesn't allow logic to decide things.  At best it can
<br>
check that a limited portion of the answer is sensible.  It's a problem
<br>
in error checking a real time control system.  Optimization doesn't
<br>
yield correct answers, it yields answers that come &quot;soon enough&quot; and are
<br>
&quot;sufficiently good&quot;.  (Humans aren't even &quot;almost optimal&quot;, but
<br>
evolution is headed towards an &quot;almost optimal&quot; solution for the current
<br>
environment.  Unfortunately, the current environment isn't stable, so
<br>
you get a rather stocastic amplification being applied to the stocastic
<br>
process that is &quot;random change&quot;.)
<br>
<p>N.B.:  I may sound authoritative, but these are just wild ass guesses. 
<br>
To me they seem reasonable, and I don't see why they would be
<br>
wrong...but they've never worn a harness.
