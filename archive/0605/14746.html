</em><br>
<p><p>I haven't read Kurzweil's book, but from reading some of his articles
<br>
online, it seems to me that he's engaging in the time-honored art of
<br>
storytelling.
<br>
<p>A story is not literally true in and of itself, but _that does not mean the
<br>
storyteller is mistaken or dishonest_. His objective is to tell a general
<br>
truth that's too vague and hard to grasp if stated as is, so he uses the
<br>
method of illustrating it with a specific possible example - even though the
<br>
specific example has too many details to have significant probability of
<br>
coming to pass as described; that doesn't matter to its purpose.
<br>
<p>My guess (which could of course be wrong; I don't know the man personally)
<br>
is that Kurzweil might reply to the above with something like: &quot;Of course I
<br>
don't claim to be able to literally foretell the year this or that will
<br>
happen; my point is to explain why I expect the general shape of the future
<br>
to be broadly in this sort of direction, rather than in certain completely
<br>
different directions that have been predicted&quot;.
<br>
<p>(BTW, great essay on the Virtues! I see I'm not the only one who finds a
<br>
kindred spirit in Musashi ^.^)
