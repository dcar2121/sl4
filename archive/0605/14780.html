</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ben
</em><br>
<p>I am just a little stunned at the two comments above (Eliezer's sarcasm, 
<br>
and then your partial agreement that this cannot be explained except by 
<br>
pure inferential stupidity).
<br>
<p>Stunned, because I am amazed at the inferential(?) stupidity that allows 
<br>
two AGI researchers to look at this experiment and not be able to see 
<br>
any factors that could have been involved.  [NOTE:  I use the word 
<br>
&quot;stupidity,&quot; of course, not to get personal :-), but just as a 
<br>
rhetorical invitation for you to contrast and compare, if you will, your 
<br>
own response to the experiment to the subjects' responses].
<br>
<p>So here goes.
<br>
<p>First, when subjects turn up to do experiments in psychologists' labs, 
<br>
all kinds of junk is going through their heads.  One of the main things 
<br>
is that, as you know, the general population has some pretty weird ideas 
<br>
about what psychology actually is, and what the researchers are up to. 
<br>
A lot of the time, I think, they view the experiment as some kind of 
<br>
test or competition between them and the experimenter, and they have to 
<br>
'prove' themselves smart in the experimenter's eyes.  This, if nothing 
<br>
else, lends an element of stress in even the most relaxed of settings.
<br>
<p>Second, the experimenter cannot answer questions (often), so if the 
<br>
subject reads the instructions and cannot understand them, they are 
<br>
supposed to do their best to interpret them.  I don't know if 
<br>
clarification questions were allowed in the above experiment.  Do you? 
<br>
I suspect they were not.
<br>
<p>Third, subjects are often hunting for &quot;the&quot; way to solve the problem set 
<br>
to them.  For whatever reason, they assume that it would somehow be 
<br>
tricky or deceitful if the experimenter set them problems that require 
<br>
them to deploy more than one strategy.  So if they find one obvious 
<br>
strategy, they go with that.
<br>
<p>Fourth, when they are given instructions by the experimenter (like 
<br>
&quot;Relax and take your time, because it does not matter&quot;), they sometimes 
<br>
(and perhaps frequently) appear to disregard some of the instructions 
<br>
(so they hear the experimenter tell them to take their time, but they 
<br>
believe that the experimenter is secretly measuring the time it takes 
<br>
them, anyway).
<br>
<p>Fifth, when the wording contains any element of ambiguity whatsoever 
<br>
(and sometimes ambiguity can be forced by the time constraints of the 
<br>
experiment, and not be at all obvious when we, at our leisure, read the 
<br>
instructions afterwards), they try to construct a model of what the 
<br>
experimenter is probably trying to get them to do, to help them resolve 
<br>
their confusion.
<br>
<p>Sixth, the experimental materials can easily contain confusing features 
<br>
that nobody ever discovers.  (Such damaging features are discovered so 
<br>
often in the years after an experiment is published, without ever being 
<br>
noticed by the original experimenters, that it makes you wonder just how 
<br>
much effort anyone ever takes to analyze possible problems with a design 
<br>
before they go ahead and do it).
<br>
<p>You're beginning to get the picture, I'm sure.
<br>
<p>So in the case of the above experiment, I had forgotten the punchline of 
<br>
the experiment, so I looked at it and did it on the spot.
<br>
<p>Hey presto:  my first answer was (2)!
<br>
<p>Why?  Because, even though I had been primed by all the Conjunction
<br>
Fallacy stuff in the last week, I completely forgot to notice that the
<br>
the first string was shorter than the other two (perhaps because all the
<br>
RRRR strings misled my eye, in the way that you may, depending on your
<br>
mail client, have had your own eye misled earlier in this sentence). And
<br>
on the other hand I did notice (because I had been primed by the only
<br>
relevant information given in the instructions) that there were
<br>
differences between the proportions of Gs and Rs in the three strings.
<br>
I was also rushing because I felt some urgency to prove to myself that I
<br>
could polish it off quickly.
<br>
<p>Well well well.  I am stupid and irrational, apparently!   And there is 
<br>
no other explanation for my (or the subjects') behavior:  it really 
<br>
cannot be anything except irrational stupidity.
<br>
<p><p><p>Some of the troubling little factors I catalogued above are matters of 
<br>
good experimental design, but some of them are just so embarrassing to 
<br>
the entire psychological community that they are ignored.  I mean, if 
<br>
*all* subjects come to your lab trying to second guess your intentions, 
<br>
no matter what you say to them, what the hell do you do?  Give up being 
<br>
an experimental psychologist?  Of course not:  you agree with all the 
<br>
other psychologists to overlook the problems (at least, if your name is 
<br>
not Gibson), and say that it will all come out in the wash.
<br>
<p>These are some of the reasons why the conclusions derived from 
<br>
experiments like these (and the other several hundred in the literature) 
<br>
don't merit the kind of most-humans-are-irrational triumphalism that I 
<br>
see around this list all too often.  To say nothing of the kind of silly 
<br>
sarcasm that only seems to demonstrate a complete ignorance of both the 
<br>
complexity of experimental design and the implications that that has for 
<br>
the robustness of conclusions derived from experiments.
<br>
<p>[And YES YES YES, if you could somehow do the impossible and eliminate 
<br>
all the factors I just mentioned (you would have to at least draw the 
<br>
subject's attention to the fact that the first string is shorter than 
<br>
the others (*)), I know that we are still going to get an interesting 
<br>
(but reduced) percentage of people who simply cannot relate the length 
<br>
of the string to the probability of getting the string to come up.  But 
<br>
in that case see my parallel arguments in the other post, which still 
<br>
apply.]
<br>
<p>If either of you were actually speaking to a more robust version of the 
<br>
above experimental design, when you assessed the implications in your 
<br>
comments above, then let me know.  If you were, that would have been a 
<br>
little sneaky, no?, because that really was not the experimental 
<br>
protocol that was quoted, and I, poor fool, have referenced that 
<br>
particular protocol in my example and not wasted a day chasing through 
<br>
the literature looking for other, more sophisticated versions of the 
<br>
design that eliminated ALL of the above issues (never learn, do I? :-)).
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.
<br>
<p><p><p>(*)  Make the subject take part in an example session in which a bunch 
<br>
of pseudo subjects take different positions (some of them betting on the 
<br>
short sequences), and give the subject the opportunity to observe a few 
<br>
cases where someone else goes for a short sequence that is identical to 
<br>
their own sequence up to that point, but in which the subject doesn't 
<br>
get the $25 payout (while of course the other person does) and instead 
<br>
have to wait for one more roll of the dice to see if they win.  Watch 
<br>
their face after that situation comes up (just for fun), and then later 
<br>
give them the real test.  I bet $25 that after that, the number of 
<br>
stupid-irrationals goes down by a factor of two, at least.  Maybe even 
<br>
eliminate the effect.  Doesn't prove a lot, except the sensitivity of 
<br>
the experiment to factors other than inherent stupidity - which latter 
<br>
ought to be constant, no?
