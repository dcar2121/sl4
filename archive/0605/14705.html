</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Kaj,
<br>
<p>I think there is some confusion here that is causing several different 
<br>
types of argument to get tangled up.
<br>
<p>1) If there are people with no direct or indirect knowledge of a field 
<br>
who are making general futurist predictions of the Popular Mechanics 
<br>
sort, OR general dismissals of the &quot;This Is Not Going To Happen For A 
<br>
Long Time&quot; sort, then those kinds of analysis are worthless.
<br>
<p>2) On the other hand, there are some people who work in a particular 
<br>
field, or who know the technical side of a field well enough, who can 
<br>
make more informed judgments about what might be over the horizon.
<br>
<p>3) The exact meaning of some of the technologies is often completely 
<br>
garbled.  &quot;Nanotech&quot; used to mean something involving nanoscale 
<br>
replicating self-assemblers.  Today the term has been coopted to mean 
<br>
various forms of small particle technology, and as a result SOME people 
<br>
talk about &quot;nanotech&quot; being five years away -- but according to the 
<br>
original definition of the word, that is nonsense.
<br>
<p><p>Out of all of this comes a confusing mishmash of predictions, some of 
<br>
which can be validly criticised and some of which can't.  Unless we go 
<br>
to some trouble to separate out the particular predictions and the 
<br>
particular people making them, it is hopeless to make generalizations 
<br>
about the value of prediction.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
