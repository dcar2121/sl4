<p>
FYI, it looks like Jeff Hawkins and Dileep George have made available
<br>
a white paper on Hierarchical Temporal Memory, the neurally-inspired
<br>
framework discussed in Hawkins' book, &quot;On Intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm still not convinced about how well their system will work on more
<br>
natural/complex stimuli, but it's an interesting read nonetheless.

<br>
<p>Dear Newsletter Subscriber:
<br>
<p>This is the third newsletter from Numenta.
<br>
<p>We are pleased to announce that we have completed a first white paper
<br>
on Hierarchical Temporal Memory. It is now available on our web site
<br>
<a href="http://www.numenta.com/Numenta_HTM_Concepts.pdf">http://www.numenta.com/Numenta_HTM_Concepts.pdf</a>. The white paper
<br>
introduces the concepts and theory behind HTM technology. For those of
<br>
you who would like to learn more about Numenta's technology, this is a
<br>
good place to start.
<br>
<p>In order to create a stronger product offering, and to facilitate more
<br>
targeted communications, we ask you to tell us a little bit about your
<br>
interest in Numenta. Please follow the profile link at the bottom of
<br>
the email in order to answer two quick questions. (Doing so is
<br>
entirely optional, and failure to do so will NOT remove you from our
<br>
list, but we'd appreciate it if you would take a minute to respond to
<br>
our two questions!)
<br>
<p>We continue to make good progress on designing and developing our
<br>
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) toolset. We have completed a first
<br>
set of learning algorithms, and are moving towards testing them in our
<br>
production environment. We recently decided to move from the MatLab
<br>
development environment for the learning algorithms to using Python,
<br>
which will enable more rapid prototyping and a smoother integration
<br>
into the C++ production environment.
<br>
<p>The overall architecture of the system has continued to progress,
<br>
along with early work on the tools themselves. Our hope is to complete
<br>
an integration milestone, bringing together the learning algorithms
<br>
within the system architecture, within the next month.
<br>
<p>We have three partners participating with us in our Numenta Partner
<br>
Program today. I'm pleased to say that we have hired Phillip Shoemaker
<br>
to be our Director of Developer Programs. Phillip has substantial
<br>
experience in working with developer communities.
<br>
<p>Our tentative plan remains to release a beta version of our toolset
<br>
before the end of 2006. It is likely that our first developer
<br>
symposium will be in 2007, giving developers a chance to work with the
<br>
tools for some time before meeting together.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your continuing interest and your support. We are very
<br>
pleased with our progress, and continue to feel that HTM technology
<br>
offers the potential to solve some significant problems in computing
<br>
across a broad range of application areas.
<br>
<p>Donna Dubinsky
<br>
CEO, Numenta
