<p><em>&gt; &gt; Can you give a reasonable account of how &quot;emotion compassion&quot; other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that directed to relatives would have improved reproductive success enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the genes building brain structures for it to become common?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sure, firstly the emotion of compassion is a direct cause of cooperation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Those who had others cooperate with them would have a survival advantage. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compassionate would be more likely to recieve reciprocal cooperation.
</em><br>
<p>I am sorry, but evolution just does not work that way.  As an example, take 
<br>
a hypothetical stone age human with great compassion for other humans, so 
<br>
great that he gives all he has to hungry people he meets on the way back 
<br>
from a hunt and his kids starve as a result.  The next generation has less 
<br>
of this quality.
<br>
<p>People *do* engage in reciprocal cooperation because it is in *their* 
<br>
interest (and the interests of their genes) to do so.  There is a *vast* 
<br>
literature on the subject.  Try &quot;Robert Axelrod&quot; or &quot;tit for tat&quot; in Google 
<br>
to access it by the ton.  Serious studies have found that humans have 
<br>
special mental circuits to detect cheaters and even mechanisms to punish them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apparently selfless compassion may well have been an advantage in mating.
</em><br>
<p>Mating is only a small part of &quot;reproductive success.&quot;  Perhaps you mean 
<br>
finding a mate?  Even having a lot of kids is not success if none of *them* 
<br>
have children.  In such examples of the hunter-gatherer life style (the 
<br>
EEA) as have been studied, bringing back a lot of meat is the most likely 
<br>
way to get more nooky.  Not &quot;selfish compassion.&quot;  This is well known.  I 
<br>
can show you how to research it if you need help.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I am not sure what you mean by &quot;emotional social conformity&quot; much less how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *that* would have contributed to reproductive success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When people feel an emotional need to act/think in a similar fasion to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arround them. Doing so would a) speed up learning - survival advantage, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and b)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make cooperation easier - again survival advantage.
</em><br>
<p>Half the tribe runs off a cliff and is killed by the fall on the rocks 
<br>
below.  Is it a survival advantage for the rest to follow?
<br>
<p>Now I make the case in URL I cited up thread that there are times where 
<br>
xenophobic memes take over the minds of a tribe's warriors and as a result 
<br>
they go out on a do or die mission against the tribe in the next 
<br>
valley.  But they are doing it in a situation where from their gene's 
<br>
viewpoint, there is little other choice.
<br>
<p>This is a depressing area of study.  Sure you want got into it?
<br>
