Hi Alekseii,
<br>
<p>Just a brief comment on the nature of the &quot;content filtering&quot; on this list...
<br>
<p>I am obviously aware of the definition of SL4, and I enjoy this list
<br>
more than nearly any other e-mail list...
<br>
<p>**However**, I do believe that the content filtering on this list (as
<br>
expressed by list sniping patterns) reflects the particular interests
<br>
of the list owner and the core list membership, just as much as it
<br>
reflects the general notion of &quot;Shock Level 4.&quot;
<br>
<p>The problem is that there is not really that much content that is
<br>
truly, strongly SL4 in nature.  If this restriction were held to
<br>
strictly, then list traffic would be a lot less than it is now.
<br>
<p>So, for topics that are &quot;borderline SL4&quot;, discretion is used, and
<br>
there is a bias toward the list owner's and core list membership's
<br>
interests.  This is not problematic in my view, as I think these
<br>
tastes are interesting ones, I'm just pointing out that it is the
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>For instance, there is a lot of discussion of mundane aspects of
<br>
Bayesian inference and rationality on this list, and this discussion
<br>
is **definitely** not all strictly &quot;SL4.&quot;   Some of it may not even be
<br>
SL1.  Rational inference is a verrrrry mainstream topic which is not
<br>
very shocking to anyone....  Granted, in a general sense it is highly
<br>
relevant to the problem of achieving a positive Singularity, but
<br>
(getting back to magnets) one may argue that human nervous system
<br>
modification is also relevant to the Singularity.  True, inserting
<br>
magnets under your skin is a primitive form of nervous system
<br>
modification with no direct Singularity relevance, but there has been
<br>
plenty of discussion on here of aspects of Bayesian inference with no
<br>
direct Singularity relevance.
<br>
<p>I think it is quite understandable that it takes list newbies a little
<br>
while to figure out exactly what the &quot;implicit taste&quot; of the list
<br>
owner and the list community considers on-topic.  It is not really
<br>
true that the list only discusses &quot;strictly, directly Shock Level 4&quot;
<br>
related topics.  It discusses those, plus a highly (and interestingly)
<br>
biased selection of indirectly Singularity related topics.
<br>

</em><br>
