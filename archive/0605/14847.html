<p>
Thinking about self-modification and Godel.
<br>
<p>If some proposed modification involves changing how the modified AI
<br>
will evaluate the desirability, D_m(S), of some specific future state
<br>
S, relative the current AI, which assigns it D_c(S), then how can the
<br>
current AI tell whether the change is actually good? If D_m(S) is not
<br>
equal to D_c(S), then by the standards of the current utility function
<br>
U_c, the proposed modification *must* be suboptimal, right?
<br>
<p>Perhaps it's the case that all self-modifications ought to be those
<br>
which preserve the values of utility calculations on known inputs, but
<br>
simply make them more efficient to calculate? But would that class of
<br>
self-improvement encompass the kind SIAI has in mind for a Friendly
<br>
AI, or would that put some undesirable limit on the shape and
<br>
development of the AI?
<br>
<p>Perhaps Godelian considerations enter when one considers
<br>
self-modifications where D_c(S) is undefined, or incalculable, and
<br>
D_m(S) is calculable.
<br>
<p>I'm aware that pretty much any self-modification is going to change
<br>
D(x) for some future state x, if trivially, because the AI simply
<br>
cannot map utility to state space exhaustively. Due to computation
<br>
restraints, it will have to decide that, within an acceptable
<br>
probability, |D_c(x) - D_m(x)| &lt; acceptable_risk, where
<br>
acceptable_risk might vary over x, etc. etc. I think these
<br>
complications can be put aside for a while.
