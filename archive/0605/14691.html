Some people answered to your questions Bob, but let me
<br>
give it to you in my own simple way. And afterwards
<br>
maybe you can respond to my doubts, on my previous
<br>
mail, about your assumptions on the average person's
<br>
view of technology.
<br>
<p>On the matter of inevitability: I don't even want to
<br>
imagine that you imply that AGI and nanotech are
<br>
impossible. To do so would mean that you are totally
<br>
ignorant on basic physics and chemistry and that you
<br>
probably believe in the divine uniqeness of the human
<br>
species, the eternal soul or something equally
<br>
delusional. They are possible and so will eventually
<br>
happen. Unless we crowl back to our caves, or the End
<br>
comes, of course (and don't even go there, it's
<br>
pointless).
<br>
<p>On the matter of proximity: you need only be informed
<br>
and follow current technologies. Talk to the experts,
<br>
listen to what they have to say. To the experts in
<br>
each field, not to futurists. It's an informed guess,
<br>
I guess. Ask some people here if they think they will
<br>
make an AGI in their lifetime. Sure, as an average
<br>
Joe, I heard it first from futurists such as yourself,
<br>
albeit more optimistic ones, but without
<br>
crossreferencing a few dozen times and applying hard
<br>
logic you shouldn't believe what anybody says
<br>
(including your own self :) ).
<br>
<p>Finally: AGI and nanotechnology are not products, Bob.
<br>
They are not the PC that is giving you a hard time.
<br>
They are part of progress. You know, from kite, to
<br>
baloon, to plane, to spaceship. From large scale, to
<br>
small scale, to even smaller scale. From abacus, to
<br>
computer, to really really really smart computer.
<br>
<p>Do you think that progress will stop just for this
<br>
generation?
<br>

<em>&gt; Bob,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The majority of the population sees nanotechnology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renewable energy, AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even AI and biotech as sci-fi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If only the general populace understood how close we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were and the potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these technologies. If only Bob. And you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define &quot;close&quot; as anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even a couple of centuries is close, though I see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a couple of decades
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the full bloom of the aforementioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies. My point is that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the majority of the population&quot; understood, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make it a top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priority and strive to make these technologies bloom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as fast as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PC, internet, cellular phones. That's about it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average Joe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;things to come&quot; haven't had an impact on every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day life yet and so are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the realm of fantasy (like the PC, internet and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cellular phones, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were in their first stages of development).
