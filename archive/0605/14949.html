</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality is built (atrificially), and people follow it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because of evolution induced emotions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well what's the hell is &quot;artificial&quot; about that, humans didn't invent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution, and for that matter who gives a hell if it is artificial? You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep using the word like it is a horrible insult, but I like artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff.
</em><br>
<p>My point is that the current artificial creations of humans will not be 
<br>
advantageous under every circumstance, and circumstances will change an awful 
<br>
lot after the singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I believe that it will be very unlikely that there will be multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumans of anywhere near the same level (at least at the top level) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power/intelligence - the most powerful would never let anyone else catch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up. Morality for cooperation will be unnesscissary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The universe is a big place, perhaps the biggest, so I think it's likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is room for more than one Jupiter brain in it, and even if there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only two morality will be essential. 
</em><br>
<p>Here lies your contradiction - Posthuman number 1 will be limited to 
<br>
morality/fear of agression if he allows another to ascend to his level of 
<br>
intelligence/power. Thus the universe is not big enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if your scenario is true and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumans try to suppress the advancement of other transhumans then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be doomed to eternal war.
</em><br>
<p>Er, no. The power differentials between posthumans will be enormous as they 
<br>
will have (greatly) varying intelligence. When one gets on top, he/her/it 
<br>
enhances his/her/its intelligence, and prevents others from doing the same - 
<br>
thus becoming untouchable and gainig absolute power. This is why people are so 
<br>
pro FAI - they see it as very unlikely that they would become posthuman no 1, 
<br>
so second choice would be a FAI sysop. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I think morality will come in very handy, but it won't be the naïve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality espoused by most on this list with their friendly AI meme; the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we could engineer a Jupiter brain in such a way that it considered our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well being more important that its own is ridiculous, such a situation would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be about as stable as balancing a pencil on its tip. 
</em><br>
<p>I do believe you are anthropomorphising the AI. We are only concerned with our 
<br>
own wellbeing because that is how evolution programed us. We program a FAI to 
<br>
concern itself whith whatever we want. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And in a way it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even moral. I find the idea of a slave who is superior to me in every way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imaginable but is nevertheless subservient to me repulsive; but that's just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, your mileage may vary.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, it does. Again, isnt this anthropomorphising. Its not a slave in the 
<br>
traditional sense as being subservient is what it most wants. And again, a FAI 
<br>
will essentially be a (unimaginably powerfull) optimisation process, and lack
<br>
many of the things that make us human. As such I dont think we can say it will 
<br>
be superior in *every* way.
