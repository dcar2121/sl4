Dani:  And fuel cell technology was invented in 1839.  Our proposed Hydrogen
<br>
Economy has been a long time coming.
<br>
<p>Your comment about hybrids got me thinking.
<br>
<p>The benefits of a hybrid car are regenerative braking, having extra
<br>
acceleration on startups (engine + motor), and being able to turn off the
<br>
engine when idling or coasting, knowing that you have your motor available
<br>
for instant power if necessary.  But couldn't we replace the expensive and
<br>
heavy motors and batteries with a flywheel?  The energy stored in a flywheel
<br>
probably wouldn't be as much as that stored in the batteries, but the car
<br>
would be much cheaper and lighter.  Seems like a nice approach to a poor
<br>
man's hybrid.
<br>
<p>I read an article about flywheel cars in the 70s, I recall (Scientific
<br>
American?).  Apparently, a flywheel can in theory hold roughly as much
<br>
energy as a tank of gas.
<br>
<p>(Sorry for the tangent.)

<p>I would distinguish between specific technologies, applications of
<br>
technology, and composite trends.
<br>
<p>The first gasoline-electric hybrid car was built in 1917, not long after
<br>
internal combustion engines and electric motors were developed.  It took
<br>
until recently for practical mass-produced hybrids to appear because they
<br>
required improved batteries and computers to perform better than pure
<br>
gasoline- driven cars.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, electric generators that run off an internal combustion
<br>
engine have been around for quite a while.  Same basic components, but not
<br>
dependant on battery weight or computer control to function well.
<br>
<p>Hybrid passenger cars are an application of several technologies, each of
<br>
which had its' own development history. They had to compete against gas-only
<br>
cars, which were also improving, and needed the right combination of concern
<br>
for the environment and high fuel prices for people to want to buy them in
<br>
non- trivial quantities.
<br>
<p>I would say that the timing of an application like hybrid cars (or flying
<br>
cars, a classic one that hasn't happened) is very unpredictable, because it
<br>
depends on so many factors.  
<br>
<p>The discovery of a new
<br>
technology, such as high temperature superconductors, carbon nanotubes, or
<br>
atomic microscopes, is also very unpredictable.  That is because it depends
<br>
on one person noticing something or having a bright idea.
<br>
About all you can do is say the laws of physics don't preclude a technology,
<br>
and that it therefore may be developed someday.
<br>
<p>A composite trend, however, such as the price/ performance of computers or
<br>
manufacturing productivity, are predictable to a reasonable degree.  In
<br>
those cases, the discoveries have been often made already, and it is a case
<br>
of getting it to the point of widepread use.  New manufacturing equipment is
<br>
twice as productive as the average of existing equipment, so it is just a
<br>
matter of comparing the values of capital spending to existing plant in
<br>
place, and you can get a pretty good idea of the pace of improvement.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimates, accurately?  It would be nice to have them, yes; but what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes you think they're available?
