It seems obvious that the cost of making a cybercastle is quite puny 
<br>
with making a real one. Plus, you can make one out of fun. In the 
<br>
medieval times, it would be kind of expensive to build a castle, you'd 
<br>
need laborwork, people, etc. It's a natural consequence of one person 
<br>
being able to make a big place. That's just cyberspace. Maybe we need 
<br>
more bots, or cyberversions of oneself.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are plenty of articles available, both supporting Second Life

<em>&gt; The wind whistles through the brick canyons of Welles City. You strain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pick up more sounds, but there's nothing. Ten-storey buildings with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one in them. An empty church. Apartment blocks, one after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, with no sign of life. It reminds you of 1980s documentaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the neutron bomb, that would kill all organic life but leave all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the buildings standing. Streets with no people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The lights still burn in Darkside. You can pick out the great vaulted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arches of its beautiful walkways from their glow. In the sunken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gardens, pools of water glitter among the polished rocks. There's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human life to disturb the scene. You feel like you might be walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through a diorama, kept on a high shelf somewhere out of sight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spindrift echoes with the sense that you're in an evacuated Russian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science city, or an abandoned Los Alamos. Spindrift's rocket gantries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are silent and unattended. You catch yourself looking for a blanket of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dust on its gorgeous experimental devices and mechanical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you're in Second Life. There is no dust. Everything is preserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in chill digital vacuum, waiting for someone to find it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I write this, there are more than forty thousand people inworld.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yet, everywhere I go is empty. All the streets I walk down recall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opening act of 28 DAYS LATER. I find myself wondering where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zombies are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lots of people have had lots to say about the recent hype surrounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second Life, but very few have addressed the basic experience of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world — that you're incredibly alone there. You can spend eighty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percent of your time walking through immense, labyrinthine castles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no one lives in. Visit a seemingly endless string of shops with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no customers.
