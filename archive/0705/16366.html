<p>There are plenty of articles available, both supporting Second Life
<br>
and tearing the experience to pieces.
<br>
<p>Boing Boing linked to this one:

<br>
<p>The wind whistles through the brick canyons of Welles City. You strain
<br>
to pick up more sounds, but there's nothing. Ten-storey buildings with
<br>
no one in them. An empty church. Apartment blocks, one after the
<br>
other, with no sign of life. It reminds you of 1980s documentaries
<br>
about the neutron bomb, that would kill all organic life but leave all
<br>
the buildings standing. Streets with no people.
<br>
<p>The lights still burn in Darkside. You can pick out the great vaulted
<br>
arches of its beautiful walkways from their glow. In the sunken
<br>
gardens, pools of water glitter among the polished rocks. There's no
<br>
human life to disturb the scene. You feel like you might be walking
<br>
through a diorama, kept on a high shelf somewhere out of sight.
<br>
<p>Spindrift echoes with the sense that you're in an evacuated Russian
<br>
science city, or an abandoned Los Alamos. Spindrift's rocket gantries
<br>
are silent and unattended. You catch yourself looking for a blanket of
<br>
dust on its gorgeous experimental devices and mechanical
<br>
constructions.
<br>
<p>But you're in Second Life. There is no dust. Everything is preserved
<br>
in chill digital vacuum, waiting for someone to find it.
<br>
<p>As I write this, there are more than forty thousand people inworld.
<br>
And yet, everywhere I go is empty. All the streets I walk down recall
<br>
the opening act of 28 DAYS LATER. I find myself wondering where the
<br>
zombies are.
<br>
----------------------
<br>
<p>Lots of people have had lots to say about the recent hype surrounding
<br>
Second Life, but very few have addressed the basic experience of the
<br>
world — that you're incredibly alone there. You can spend eighty
<br>
percent of your time walking through immense, labyrinthine castles
<br>
that no one lives in. Visit a seemingly endless string of shops with
<br>
no customers.
