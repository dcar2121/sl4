You don't think that the tools we have affect the way we think? People with
<br>
extensive computer experience have certain terms (e.g. 'diff') that the rest
<br>
of us don't automatically use; someone obsessed with economics is much more
<br>
likely to instinctively think on the margin; and someone who spends a lot of
<br>
time in Second Life certainly knows that physical appearance is a means of
<br>
self-expression, not a fixed property. We can pick tools that positively
<br>
affect our behavior. I can't think of a definition of human nature that fits
<br>
what you said, other than the tautological &quot;That which we can't change.&quot;

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; My analogy is lost, but Second Life still sucks. There have for years

<em>&gt; shame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; that being marginally shinier and having a lot of users who build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; crap should cement its pervasive application.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The dark side of &quot;Shock Level 4&quot; is not all the advanced technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefit that enlightened individuals can conceive, but the perversions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they will be applied to for/by those less enlightened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has to be taken as a given, technology doesn't change basic human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drives. Come up with a neat new piece of technology, and people are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think &quot;how will this get me more money, get me laid, get me high, give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me power&quot;. Even given the power to change the genome, it will likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these urges that influence the changes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The place everyone makes a mistake is thinking &quot;oh thats horrible!&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to be above it all. Humans are the most dangerous animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the planet, if you owned a lion you'd make sure it was well fed and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well treated. Yet humans who are the most dangerous animal of all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we starve and abuse the poor animal inside while pretending to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something special and pure above having an animal nature. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalists show where this leads, despising life and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, praying for global suicide to put them out of there misery.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll argue for the intentional antimonian approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the first use of true virtual reality means being able to go online
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and having mind blowingly realistic sex with someone 1/2 way around the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet, thats a great thing. It means that persons going to be nice to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people that day, and being well satiated may be thinking about the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the human race rather than getting revenge on the person who just cut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them off. That person who cut them off won't be stressed out, and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think more carefully about the rational for war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human nature will win in the end, we can feed the lion on our own terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or ignore it and it will feed on its terms. Given the power that is coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into our hands, I don't see a choice. We must stop the purity game, else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we put our power in the hands of angry wild animals.
