Well, the three technologies that you quote are integrable in SL thru
<br>
external gateways at this moment, and will become fully integrated in
<br>
the platform soon. Spatial voice chat is in the new beta client, works
<br>
very well and will be in the release client in a few weeks. IRC is
<br>
available thru SLchat &lt;-&gt; IRC gateways and often used by people who
<br>
wish to participate in our chats without being in SL. It will also be
<br>
available natively when Sl switch from their proprietary chat system
<br>
to one compatible with open standards including IRC.
<br>
<p>My company may get some funding to develop an adaptation of webinars
<br>
to SL, but i think we can do something *much* better than conventional
<br>
webinars.
<br>
<p>We should bear in mind that the metaverse today is like the 2D web in
<br>
1992. At that time I was a Compuserve user very frustrated by being
<br>
unable to send email to AOL users and viceversa. Things have
<br>
progressed a lot since then. I am sure the 3D/VR metaverse of 2012
<br>
(which probably will be based on interoperable technologies and will
<br>
not be called Second Life) will be really cool. Of course, in 2012 we
<br>
will be complaining that it does not do this and that, and technology
<br>
will continue to evolve.
<br>
<p>G.
