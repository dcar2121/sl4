<em>&gt;&gt; My analogy is lost, but Second Life still sucks. There have for years been

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; The dark side of &quot;Shock Level 4&quot; is not all the advanced technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit that enlightened individuals can conceive, but the perversions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they will be applied to for/by those less enlightened.
</em><br>
<p>This has to be taken as a given, technology doesn't change basic human
<br>
drives. Come up with a neat new piece of technology, and people are going
<br>
to think &quot;how will this get me more money, get me laid, get me high, give
<br>
me power&quot;. Even given the power to change the genome, it will likely be
<br>
these urges that influence the changes.
<br>
<p>The place everyone makes a mistake is thinking &quot;oh thats horrible!&quot;, and
<br>
trying to be above it all. Humans are the most dangerous animals
<br>
on the planet, if you owned a lion you'd make sure it was well fed and
<br>
well treated. Yet humans who are the most dangerous animal of all, 
<br>
we starve and abuse the poor animal inside while pretending to be 
<br>
something special and pure above having an animal nature. The
<br>
fundamentalists show where this leads, despising life and the 
<br>
world, praying for global suicide to put them out of there misery.
<br>
<p>I'll argue for the intentional antimonian approach.
<br>
<p>If the first use of true virtual reality means being able to go online
<br>
and having mind blowingly realistic sex with someone 1/2 way around the
<br>
planet, thats a great thing. It means that persons going to be nice to
<br>
people that day, and being well satiated may be thinking about the future 
<br>
of the human race rather than getting revenge on the person who just cut 
<br>
them off. That person who cut them off won't be stressed out, and will
<br>
think more carefully about the rational for war.
<br>
<p>Human nature will win in the end, we can feed the lion on our own terms,
<br>
or ignore it and it will feed on its terms. Given the power that is coming
<br>
into our hands, I don't see a choice. We must stop the purity game, else
<br>
we put our power in the hands of angry wild animals.
