<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't read the book, but as best as I can tell from the reviews I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read, he has some sort of religious attitude, and he emotionally likes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that the mysteries of the universe will remain forever beyond our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grasp!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I've read the book. It is intellectually sloppy, imho, but it is interesting
<br>
to hear what famous scientists and philosopher have to say on the question
<br>
of the end of science, so in this sense it is worth the price of admission.
<br>
The main problem I have with it is that Horgan fails to clearly distinguish
<br>
between the following reasons why science might end: (1) That we (humans)
<br>
have made all the (exciting) discoveries, or (2) there are scientific truths
<br>
(about our reality) beyond the reach of our human all too human minds, or
<br>
(3) there are truths beyond the reach of scientific methodology. (I might
<br>
add that Horgan is not alone here. You often see transhumanists talk as if
<br>
the universe is ultimately governed by evolutionary forces and game
<br>
theoretic considerations that are all too easily comprehended by us and yet
<br>
appeal to the possibility of a superintelligence. I'm not saying that these
<br>
are inconsistent, only that it relies on often unstated and unargued
<br>
assumption that the most basic laws are comprehensible by us and SIs).  It
<br>
is hard to think of uncontroversial examples of 1, but perhaps cartography
<br>
is as a close as any. The really &quot;big&quot; discoveries have been made, there are
<br>
probably no more continents to discover for example. There is lots of mop up
<br>
work to do, we can get more accurate maps using gps etc. but the big thrills
<br>
are probably exhausted. Sometimes Horgan talks like this is what he means by
<br>
the end of science. 2 is sometimes mentioned by Horgan and those that he
<br>
interviews. This idea is familiar enough around here given talk about SI
<br>
that it hardly needs comment--perhaps there is yet hope for cartography. ;)
<br>
The third is a possibility that is less often mentioned. This idea can be
<br>
told against simplistic versions of the intellectual history of the West
<br>
where science supplants metaphysics which in turned supplanted religious
<br>
authority as the methodology for arriving at the truth. The induction here
<br>
is of course that a SI may use methodology X that usurps scientific
<br>
methodology. Of course we have no idea whether X is even possible but, there
<br>
is perhaps a dash of irony in the fact that we have to keep this open as an
<br>
empirical-scientific hypothesis. I have argued that as a pragmatic matter
<br>
science ought to attempt to create SI, because even if we are in a position
<br>
like that described by 1, we cannot know that we are (for the usual
<br>
transcendental reasons). Only by attempting to create SI can we hope to
<br>
decide between 1, 2, and 3.
