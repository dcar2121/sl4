</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I mostly agree with your opinions here.  Our opinions seem to differ on
<br>
how we would define a Friendly seed AI vs. a more 'adult' version.
<br>
<p>I consider the development of a seed AI to be a continuous process.  The
<br>
developmental point at which we would want to introduce the concept of
<br>
'competition' should be carefully chosen.  Same thing for 'deception'.
<br>
My argument is, that these concepts are so basic, and such an intrinsic
<br>
part of human society and language, that they their introduction should
<br>
not be left to chance, but rather be properly encapsulated within a
<br>
larger context.
<br>
<p>We are attempting to create a generally intelligent mind, one that can
<br>
understand all the possible options, and *want* to choose Friendly ones.
<br>
To provide a flawed education to such a being, one that omits the nasty
<br>
bits about humans, would IMO be a huge mistake.  It would leave the
<br>
growing mind with a skewed view of humans and human society, one that
<br>
almost certainly would lead to poor decision-making in the real world.
<br>
Friendliness is about dealing with the issues head-on, and taking
<br>
friendly actions/decisions... not hiding
<br>
important/pertinent/uncomfortable knowledge out of fear.
