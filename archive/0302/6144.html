<p>
First off, what's a media kit?
<br>
<p>&quot;It's like a resume for your company.  It's a collection of company
<br>
information and articles put together to inspire interest in media,
<br>
investors, client, and potential employees.  The goal is to create a kit
<br>
that grabs the reader's attention, creates a killer impression, helps them
<br>
remember you, and makes them hunger to know more.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'd like to know if anyone is interested in helping to create such a kit for
<br>
the Singularity Institute.  Those with experience in graphics design, media
<br>
relations, or writing, would be extremely valuable in this task.
<br>
<p>The following are some ideas for the kit:
<br>
__________________________________________
<br>
<p>* Focus on specific material.
<br>
* Less is often more.
<br>
* Include the five W's: who, what, when, where, why.
<br>
* Include a summary of the Institute (e.g., mission statement; past
<br>
accomplishments; present goals; future plans; donor/volunteer/affiliate
<br>
comments; benefits of the Institute's mission).
<br>
* Include the most recent SIAI newsletter.
<br>
* Include the most recent news releases.
<br>
* Include the most recent press coverage.
<br>
* Include a page (front and back) of testimonials.
<br>
* Include a list of frequently asked questions (journalists may use this
<br>
list as a reference for article or interview material).
<br>
* Include a news story sample (journalists may use this verbatim; if not, it
<br>
may at least reduce their workload).
<br>
* Include high-quality photos of board members.
<br>
* Include biographies of board members.
<br>
* Include contact information (e.g., two business cards - one for the
<br>
individual to keep and one to pass on).
<br>
* Create a collection of press coverage (printed or online material).
<br>
* Create a noticeable package (e.g., an interesting envelope; an envelope
<br>
with an interesting saying on the outside [&quot;Life-changing information
<br>
enclosed within&quot;]; and a professional presentation folder).
<br>
* Send the media kit as a PDF on a CD.
<br>
* Send the media kit via 1st or 2nd day mail, or personally deliver it (the
<br>
extra effort may help).
<br>
* Make a follow-up phone call three to four days after the package was sent,
<br>
to insure the media kit was received; take the opportunity to answer any
<br>
questions, to get to know the journalist, etc.
<br>
* Send a handwritten note of thanks to the journalist for writing a news
<br>
story about the Institute, or for discussing with you the possibility of
<br>
writing one.
<br>
* Send all media contacts an updated kit every four months.
