<p>MRA&gt; I have answered that question postively, for the following reasons.
<br>
<p>MRA&gt; 1) A game can be competitive, or non-competitive.  The degree of
<br>
MRA&gt; competitivenes can be arbitrarily set in the design of the game.
<br>
<p>MRA&gt; 2) A game can be an analogy of reality, a model, within which:
<br>
<p>MRA&gt;  a) a Seed AI can learn skills and techniques...
<br>
MRA&gt;       and can be *seen* to learn them (or not).
<br>
<p>MRA&gt;  b) there are no negative real-world consequences
<br>
MRA&gt;       to success/non-success (winning/losing).
<br>
<p>I think 2) is the most essential and productive definition of game, in
<br>
that they can provide a context for learning without *real* consequences.
<br>
<p>Gregory Bateson, in talking about communication, offered the idea of
<br>
&quot;play&quot; as a precursor to abstract language.  That is to say, dogs
<br>
snarling at each other playfully are indicating that they are _not_
<br>
doing what is indicated by the snarling -- which would be fighting.
<br>
<p>The ability to speak of a hypothetical, the ability to use &quot;not&quot;, lies
<br>
at the base of the ability to communicate abstractions.  In that
<br>
context, play and games are invaluable.
<br>
<p>[Tangentially related: James P. Carse on _Finite and Infinite Games_.
<br>
And Gregory Bateson in _Steps to an Ecology of Mind_ speculates that
<br>
animal awareness may have similarities to our dream consciousness: the
<br>
absence of tenses, the absence of &quot;not&quot; and &quot;this is a simile&quot; --
<br>
rather, everything is direct.]
