Greetings, Durant
<br>
<p>you wrote:

<em> &gt; I think of emotions as putting people into states, like we're big fuzzy

<em>&gt; Finite State Machines, and in these states, the likelihoods of various
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; various states might exist simultaneously with varying degrees of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this framework, new emotions could either come from new structural
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; are emotions you haven't felt yet.
</em><br>
<p>I agree w/ what you said about emotions putting people into states.  I
<br>
personally view the functional purpose of emotional states as being
<br>
primarily vectors acting upon mental states, which can result in behavioral
<br>
changes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Hmm, if you really don't want a technical discussion of neuroscience,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this might not be a good paragraph :) I read The Chemical State of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consciousness and from hearing about things like Prozac and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mood altering drugs&quot; I'm sure there's a correlation with chemicals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw a documentary about alcohol delaying the synapse fining in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, so there is evidence (if it is right) that chemical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrical activity are both involved in mood regulation.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed chemicals and electrical activity are involved in mood regulation.
<br>
Take the example you gave about alcohol delaying synaptic firing:  these
<br>
delays are what you feel, not the alcohol itself.  If one were to devise a
<br>
way of creating such delays using a totally non-chemical means, you would
<br>
feel the same way as you would if those delays were caused by alcohol.
<br>
<p>That's what I mean by emotions not being intrinsic to chemical effects.
<br>
IMO, emotions are states and changes in brain activity patterns - and that
<br>
the whole of brain activity is what gives rise to the 'mind'.  As such, what
<br>
causes a given shift in activity is essentially irrelevant to the subjective
<br>
experience of emotion. The change is what you feel, not the underlying
<br>
mechanism(s)
<br>
<p>keep in mind that my original post was a re-post of a message I posted on
<br>
the wta-arts group, which is not a technically oriented group. :)
