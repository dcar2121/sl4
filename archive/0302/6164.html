Hmmm.  I think I partly disagree....
<br>
<p>While I don't think we should explicitly shield a baby AGI from the
<br>
existence of competition, I think that its early education should explicitly
<br>
focus on cooperation rather than competition.
<br>
<p>It's not that I think competition is intrinsically bad, but emphasizing
<br>
cooperation over competition seems to me to be &quot;erring on the side of
<br>
safety&quot;.
<br>
<p>Of course, a baby AGI must also be taught about competition.  But all in
<br>
all, I'd be happier seeing it play SimAnt than Doom... ;-)
<br>
<p>Michael, I read your post carefully but I'm not sure if you disagree with my
<br>
perspective or not.  I am not suggesting shielding the AGI from anything,
<br>
but I'm also suggesting avoiding explicitly training it to be a &quot;winner&quot; in
<br>
competitions.
<br>
<p>This is in line with my (non-innovative) general idea that most AGI morality
<br>
is going to come about through experiential learning/teaching rather than
<br>
programming.

<p><em>&gt; We should not avoid exposing an FSI to competitive ideas in an attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to somehow channel the intellect into cooperative-only pathways.  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not?  Firstly, it would not work.  Even the most cursory examination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human knowledge would reveal competition at every point.  Even the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; casual conversation with a normal human being will lead an FSI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulate the ideas of competitiveness and opposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas/groups/opinions.
