<em>&gt; If you're going to say &quot;these are just games and you should not think

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Indeed.  That is exactly the opposite of my suggestion, which is: if
<br>
competitive games are to be taught, they must be taught within a wider
<br>
positive-sum context.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Worse yet, what if it learns how to be deceptive while playing games.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, what if?  This issue shares similar difficulties to that of
<br>
competition, and I would suggest similar solutions.  Deception is a
<br>
useful technique is certain situations, as long as it is used as a
<br>
subgoal in service of a larger positive-sum goal - such as the poker
<br>
example.  As with competitiveness, deception should be explained and
<br>
taught only when the Seed AI can understand its utility in the larger
<br>
positive-sum context.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is far more to games than winning and losing.  If that were all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were we could probably have a seed AI play games, but games are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much deeper than you seem to be thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Games can be as 'shallow' or as 'deep' as you want to make them.  I am
<br>
not currently addressing the depth of games in this thread, but rather
<br>
the idea of competition within games as part of the educational process.
