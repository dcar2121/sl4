</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure, Gordon.
<br>
<p>For a superintelligent AI to lie to inferior humans will probably never be
<br>
necessary or useful.
<br>
<p>But, when dealing with equals or superiors, the truth is that lying can be
<br>
an important tactic.
<br>
<p>If I were in WWII Germany, and were hiding in some German dude's basement
<br>
(I'm Jewish), and the SS came in and asked the German dude &quot;Do you know
<br>
where any Jews are?&quot; ... well, my wish would be that the German dude would
<br>
LIE HIS ASS OFF !!
<br>
<p>It's an extreme example, but it makes the point that lying is not always
<br>
bad.
<br>
<p>Hopefully a superhuman AI will never encounter a situation requiring to lie.
<br>
<p>But, what happens when it meets a transdimensional entity hell-bent on
<br>
destroying all organic life forms, and it's asked &quot;Do you know where any
<br>
organic life forms are?&quot;  Again, I hope it'll lie its virtual, hypothetical
<br>
ass off!!
<br>
<p>Honesty is a very important value.  But it's not an absolute value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any games a Friendly seed AI plays
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be non competitive and, more so, have no room for immoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques.  The only game an AI can play is the be-moral game (and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subgames, like the make-everybody-happy game), and even then we must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; careful not to expose it to deception being employed by other players
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and pieces.  If you think about it more you'll see the only kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game a Friendly seed AI can safely play isn't much of a game in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms, but is still recognizable as a game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think an adult FAI will be able to fully handle being exposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who lie without fear that it will start lying itself.  Until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such time, demonstrating the effectiveness of lying could be deadly.
</em><br>
<p>My intuition is that your approach, Gordon, would create a terribly
<br>
&quot;sheltered&quot; digital mind, totally unable to deal with the real human world
<br>
once it was released.  Game-playing gives it practice mucking around in
<br>
risk-free situations similar, in some respects, to those it will actually
<br>
encounter once released into the world.  NOT giving it this kind of practice
<br>
seems to me to be the dangerous thing.
