<em>&gt; From: &quot;Jonathan Standley&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:standley@rcn.com?Subject=Re:%20the%20origin%20of%20subjective%20'feelings'">standley@rcn.com</a>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; Indeed chemicals and electrical activity are involved in mood regulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take the example you gave about alcohol delaying synaptic firing:  these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delays are what you feel, not the alcohol itself.  If one were to devise a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of creating such delays using a totally non-chemical means, you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel the same way as you would if those delays were caused by alcohol.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what I mean by emotions not being intrinsic to chemical effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO, emotions are states and changes in brain activity patterns - and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole of brain activity is what gives rise to the 'mind'.  As such, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes a given shift in activity is essentially irrelevant to the subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of emotion. The change is what you feel, not the underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism(s)
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yes, I see what you're saying, now. I agree. And hopefully we'll be
<br>
able to transfer our minds, to faster, more reliable hardware. I do 
<br>
think the the enlargement of possibilities for our future mental states
<br>
will lead to what we'll call entirely new emotions. We'll just have to
<br>
get there and find out, won't we :)
<br>
<p>Speaking of feelings, I'm just recovering from a cold and as I was in 
<br>
the throes of cough and fever, I decided to finally read _Blood Music_.
<br>
The added irony of being ill at the time increased my appreciation of
<br>
the book. I recommend the experience to anyone if you're going to be 
<br>
sick anyway :) I got the book from the Singularity book list thread
<br>
on sl4 sometime last year. I had no idea there were books out there
<br>
that addressed these ideas so well. I must find more. Childhood's
<br>
End is next on that list for me.
<br>
<p>On the topic of books, I also just happened to finish _The Advent of
<br>
the Algorithm_, by David Berlinsky. I really liked the imaginitive
<br>
style and the historical information provided. The vocabulary was
<br>
rich and kept me reaching for my cpen(*). However, there were
<br>
several biases that did not agree with me. I kept feeling that he
<br>
somehow felt that mathematics held supremacy over computer science
<br>
(algorithms). And he kept tip-toeing around whether computers could
<br>
have consciousnesses and then he'd lean heavily in the direction of
<br>
the idea of a supreme being in charge of everything. I pretty much
<br>
wanted to retch in the final fanciful discussion with the archbishop
<br>
and the scientist. The argument Berlinsky was championing was fatally
<br>
flawed (forces are a part of physical reality, though he concludes 
<br>
they are not...at least their verifiable manifestations are and that's
<br>
all that matters, IMO. That part is really minor though compared to
<br>
my reaction to it) It's too bad I can't recommend the book. I almost 
<br>
really liked it. 
<br>
<p>One book that I did like, eventhough I did not agree with the author's 
<br>
final conclusions, was _Non-Zero_, about how, from the biological to 
<br>
the sociological, Non-Zero games proliferate and beat out zero sum
<br>
ones. Wright's conclusion that this implies there is a supreme being
<br>
I think also has flaws, but at least he separated those comments into
<br>
a final section at the end and generously warned the reader that those
<br>
ideas were highly speculative and that it could be skipped altogether. 
<br>
I can recommend that book. Much less double-handedness in it's 
<br>
implications and the thesis, by itself, is a really good one. There
<br>
may be a Supreme Being, as I suggested in my essay to sl4 &quot;The Frozen
<br>
Accident God&quot;, but so far, most of the arguments for it seem based 
<br>
more on hope than reason. Then again, I only have a biased monkey
<br>
brain, like the rest of 'em :)
<br>

<br>
<p>PS - If I'm not able to post much in the up coming weeks (as I 
<br>
continue work on the Hulk), I hope to see some of you at the 
<br>
Foresight Conference, this year.
