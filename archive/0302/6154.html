I posted this on the wta-arts yahoo group today, I was wondering what your
<br>
thoughts were on the topic it addresses.  the &gt;'ed paragraph is part of the
<br>
post I was replying to...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an example, I hear people speaking of there being &quot;new&quot;
</em><br>
emotions. So
<br>
<em>&gt; how can the viewers identify with the hero's &quot;plubertness&quot; if
</em><br>
niether they
<br>
<em>&gt; nor the actor nor the director has the faintest idea what it means
</em><br>
to feel
<br>
<em>&gt; plubertness or what it is? Be interesting, in a dramatic
</em><br>
presentation, to see if
<br>
<em>&gt; anyone could handle an invented &quot;new&quot; emotion in a reasonable way.
</em><br>
<p>interesting idea...
<br>
<p>I realize this is tangential to the point of your post, but:
<br>
<p>I have serious doubts as to the possibility of 'new' emotions
<br>
(without radical changes in the brains architecture). Not that
<br>
there is an unsurmountable technical barrier as such, but rather
<br>
that we already posess the full range of emotions 'possible' for a
<br>
system that is similar to our brain. As such, I think 'new'
<br>
emotions would only be a possibility once one's mind was 'running'
<br>
on a structure quite unlike that of the natural human brain.
<br>
<p>My reason for making these statements is my beliefs as to the nature
<br>
of emotions. ask yourself: what is the cause of emotional responses
<br>
in the human brain? The answer is rather simple in concept, though
<br>
the details of it are still largely unknown.
<br>
<p>this isn't the place IMO for technical discussion of neuroscience,
<br>
so I'll cut to the chase :) I believe that when one
<br>
subjectively 'feels' emotions, what you are feeling is changes in
<br>
the dynamic information patterns that is 'you'. SSRI's make
<br>
you 'feel' mentally balanced, but how can you feel a chemical? what
<br>
you feel is the changes in neural activity that the chemical induces.
<br>
<p>The gross architecture of neural activity patterns is similar
<br>
in 'normal' people; schizophrenics and others who are mentally ill
<br>
show significant deviation from baseline neural patterns. If you
<br>
accept my arguments of the previous paragraphs, then it follows that
<br>
emotion is not intrinsic to the chemicals in your brain. And that in
<br>
turn suggests a certain universality of emotions...
<br>
<p>Just some random thoughts ;)
