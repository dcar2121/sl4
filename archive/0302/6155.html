<p>
The Singularity is appearing more and more frequently in science fiction
<br>
these days. Since Vernor Vinge's original formulation, the Singularity has
<br>
been making more appearances, including in Damien Broderick's novel
<br>
_Transcension_ and in the short stories of Charles Stross. (And a hearty
<br>
&quot;Thanks, Damien!&quot; for tipping me/us about Mr. Stross!)
<br>
<p>Charlie Stross (about whom see more at <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/</a>),
<br>
like SF writer David Brin (more comments on Brin to come in a later
<br>
message), has gone beyond the Singularity event horizon. Vinge deliberately
<br>
sets his post-Singularity stories far from Earth so as not to have to
<br>
describe the situation there. Broderick's novel (unlike his non-fiction
<br>
Singularity book _The Spike_; for a summary see
<br>
<a href="http://www.panterraweb.com/tearing1.htm">http://www.panterraweb.com/tearing1.htm</a>) touches upon the Singularity only
<br>
at its inception. But Stross dives right in to show us his vision of what
<br>
lies beyond the Singularity's Schwarzchild radius.
<br>
<p>Stross does not write for the uninitiated. His use of concepts and
<br>
terminology from science, computer technology, and extropian/transhumanist
<br>
philosophies is given straight up, with no condescending definitions or
<br>
analogies to help novice readers.
<br>
<p>To give a flavor of his work, I present here an excerpt from Stross's
<br>
novella &quot;Router&quot; (Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, Sept. 2002, pp.
<br>
115-116). The context of the story will become (somewhat) apparent from this
<br>
extended quotation. Suffice to say that it takes place among uploads sitting
<br>
in a simulated barroom on an interstellar space craft. But I urge everyone
<br>
to obtain the original and enjoy an intellectual feast of stimulating
<br>
speculation.

<br>
<p>[Journalist Donna asks] &quot;Do you believe in the singularity?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Am I a singularitarian, do you mean?&quot; asks Pierre, a fixed grin coming to
<br>
his face.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, no, no!&quot; Donna waves him down, grins broadly, nods to Su Ang: &quot;I do
<br>
not mean it like that! Attend: what I meant to ask was whether you in this
<br>
concept of a singularity believe, and if so, where it is?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Is this intended for a public interview?&quot; asks Ang.
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, I cannot into a simulation drag you off and expose you to an
<br>
imitative reality excursion, can I?&quot; Donna leans back as the bartender
<br>
places a ceramic stein in front of her.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh. Well.&quot; Ang glances a warning at Pierre and dispatches a very private
<br>
memo to scroll across his vision: _don't play with her, this is serious_.
<br>
Boris is watching Ang with an expression of hopeless longing; Pierre tries
<br>
to ignore it all, taking the journalist's question seriously. &quot;The
<br>
singularity is a bit like that old-time American Christian rapture nonsense,
<br>
isn't it?&quot; he says. &quot;When we all go a-flying up to heaven, leaving our
<br>
bodies behind?&quot; He snorts, reaches into thin air and gratuitously violates
<br>
causality by summoning a jug of ice-cold sangria into existence: &quot;The
<br>
rapture of the nerds. I'll drink to that.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But when did it take place?&quot; asks Donna. &quot;My audience, they will to know
<br>
your opinion be needing.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Four years ago, when we instantiated this ship,&quot; Pierre says promptly.
<br>
<p>&quot;Back in 2016,&quot; says Ang, &quot;When Amber's father liberated the uploaded
<br>
lobsters.&quot; [NOTE: See Charles Stross' story &quot;Lobsters&quot; which can be obtained
<br>
online for pennies from www.fictionwise.com]
<br>
<p>&quot;Is not happening _yet_,&quot; contributes Boris. &quot;Singularity implies infinite
<br>
rate of change achieved momentarily. Future not amenable thereafter to
<br>
prediction by pre-singularity beings, right? So has not happened.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Au contraire: it happened on June 6th 1969, at 11 hundred hours, eastern
<br>
seaboard time,&quot; Pierre counters. &quot;That was when the first network
<br>
control-protocol packets were sent from the data port of one IMP to
<br>
another--the first ever internet connection. _That's_ the singularity. Since
<br>
then we've all been living in a universe that is impossible to predict from
<br>
events prior to that time.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That's rubbish,&quot; counters Boris. &quot;Singularity is load of religious junk.
<br>
Christian mystic rapture recycled for atheist nerds.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Not so,&quot; Su Ang glances at him, hurt. &quot;Here we are, sixty-something hundred
<br>
minds. We've migrated--while still awake--right out of our own heads using
<br>
an amazing combination of nanotechnology and electron spin-resonance
<br>
mapping, and we're now running as software in an operating system designed
<br>
to virtualize multiple physics models and provide a simulation of reality
<br>
that doesn't let us go mad from sensory deprivation! _And_ this whole
<br>
package is about the size of a fingertip, crammed into a starship the size
<br>
of your grandmother's old walkman, in orbit around a brown dwarf just over
<br>
three light years from home, on its way to plug into a network router
<br>
created by incredibly ancient alien species, and you tell _me_ that the idea
<br>
of a fundamental change in the human condition is nonsense?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Mmph.&quot; Boris looks perplexed. &quot;Would not put it that way. The _singularity_
<br>
is nonsense, not uploading or--&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yah, right.&quot; Ang smiles at Boris and he wilts.
