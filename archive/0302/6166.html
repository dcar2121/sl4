<em>&gt; Training an AGI to be a &quot;winner&quot; in competitions before the AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understands the wider context of game-playing, and the non-zero-summess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the competition within that wider context, would be a mistake.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once the AGI can understand the context, and how humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games/competition operate positively within it, then it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterproductive to *avoid* training how to win games.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, I think we agree, then.
<br>
<p>To make a human-childhood analogy -- which I wouldn't want to overstretch --
<br>
it's a bit like the difference between teaching a 3-year-old competitive
<br>
games, and teaching a 9-year-old competitive games.  A 3-year-old does not
<br>
understand broader context, and having them do a lot of competitive stuff
<br>
really can cause them to develop an overly competitive outlook on life.  But
<br>
a 9-year-old understands well that &quot;it's just a game&quot;....
<br>
<p>Of course, there is an obvious problem in that our understanding of AI
<br>
developmental psychology is not going to be very good until AFTER we've
<br>
already raised a bunch of baby AGI's to adulthood....  This means that we
<br>
may well not allow the first N baby AGI's to reach adulthood.  Murdering
<br>
them would be unethical ... so maybe we'll keep them as toddlers until we
<br>
successfully raise an adult AGI capable of properly bringing them up... ;-)
