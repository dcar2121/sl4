More recently (in 1999), Horgan had his next book; &quot;The Undiscovered Mind:
<br>
How the Human Brain Defies Replication, Medication, and Explanation&quot;
<br>
published (quite an explicit name, no?). One of his last few chapters of
<br>
&quot;The end of Science&quot; touches on the end of some of the neurosciences, which
<br>
apparently drew more fire to him than any other section of the book. Since
<br>
perhaps Physicists will never be able to find that &quot;one big theory&quot; which
<br>
revolutionized everything (i.e., Quantum Theory), he argues that other
<br>
sciences have passed their zenith, or at least they are out of big things to
<br>
discover; all that remains is to refine what we already know; no big
<br>
discoveries or scientific paradigm shifts looming on the horizon as far as
<br>
Horgan is concerned.
<br>
<p>But Neurosciences and AI are just getting started, they certainly have not
<br>
reached their zeniths yet (as most anyone will argue against him). I'm
<br>
reading his book right now, and apparently his argument is that the realm of
<br>
objective and rational science cannot ever fully explain the subjective
<br>
world of the mind (i.e., the hard problems of consciousness, qualia). Which
<br>
is the exact opposite of my stance; since the brain which generates the
<br>
conscious mind is clearly rooted within the physical universe, just as much
<br>
as quarks, stars, or computers are, I see no reason to believe that science
<br>
would be unable to explain consciousness while being able to explain quarks,
<br>
stars, or computers.
<br>
<p>I think Horgan is wrong about, well, just about everything, but his books
<br>
still make for an interesting read at the very least.
