<p><em>&gt; Your phrase, &quot;as we think of them&quot; leads me to doubt we are talking

</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions I am using:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game n. (Form of) contest played according to rules and decided by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skill, strength or luck. &lt;Concise Oxford&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game n. A competitive activity or sport in which players contend with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other according to a set of rules. &lt;American Heritage&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly what I meant by &quot;as we think of them&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Ben Goertzel opined, teaching an AGI to play games could be entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a positive thing, as long as ve understands, &quot;it's just a game.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is what's dangerous.  What if the seed AI plays chess, learns what 
<br>
it means to compete and win, enjoys it, and then proceeds to apply 
<br>
competition elsewhere.  What if it then decides that it's competing 
<br>
with humans for computational resources?
<br>
<p>Worse yet, what if it learns how to be deceptive while playing games.  
<br>
Think about any sufficiently complex game and you'll realize that one 
<br>
of the key strategies is not letting your opponent know what you're 
<br>
going to do.  Perhaps the best example of this is poker, where an 
<br>
ability to deceive your opponents is key to winning.  Given it thinks 
<br>
it's competing for resources with humans, now it is fully able to 
<br>
deceive us.  We want it to be Friendly, so it pretends to be Friendly 
<br>
so well that we can't tell the difference.  Then, when we think 
<br>
everything is okay and it starts going FOOM, we discover that it had 
<br>
deceived us and are prompted turned into computronium.
<br>
<p>If you're going to say &quot;these are just games and you should not think 
<br>
about them in relation to anything&quot; then you might as well not have any 
<br>
games played at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At first, the competitiveness of the games presented should (IMO) be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very low or zero.  But as the Seed AI gains understanding of a wider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context, competitive elements can be added with confidence that they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and will) be explained in that wider context.  Competition can be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned technique that benefits all, players and non-players alike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of &quot;Ha! I win! I win! Now I can squash you like a bug!&quot; we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have, &quot;Hoohoo! I win! Now let's apply this new technique to solving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protein folding problem.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There is far more to games than winning and losing.  If that were all 
<br>
there were we could probably have a seed AI play games, but games are 
<br>
much deeper than you seem to be thinking.
