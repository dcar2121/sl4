</em><br>
<p>Okay, maybe there are some things I'm not making clear.  We have been 
<br>
assuming that we need to teach a Friendly seed AI.  Just for a moment, 
<br>
if we consider a FSAI that is designed such that it can't help but be 
<br>
Friendly, there will be no need to train it; we can just set it loose 
<br>
on the world and everything will be hunky-dorry.  We can even let 
<br>
those-who-we-shall-not-name be responsible for it, tell it all sorts of 
<br>
garbage, and still have everything turn out fine.  Hurray.
<br>
<p>Now, as we have been assuming, we need to train the FSAI to make sure 
<br>
it stays Friendly.  The former situation is preferable, in which case 
<br>
we can teach it just about anything or just hook it up to the Web and 
<br>
it'll figure things out, but may not be possible or, even if it is, not 
<br>
provably that our FSAI is such a FSAI.  Given this, until the seed AI 
<br>
is all grown up and able to make its own decisions fully in accordance 
<br>
with Friendliness (or, more generally, morality), we stand the chance 
<br>
of teaching it something wrong.  It's not a matter of hiding things 
<br>
from the seed AI, but a matter of protecting it from ideas that it 
<br>
can't handle without breaking it.  Some forms of breakage, if we're 
<br>
lucky, will be immediately obvious so that we can pull the plug.  More 
<br>
likely, it will learn how to do something like lie and we won't know 
<br>
until we're already being spread with marmalade.
<br>
<p>As far as the Friendly AI growing up with a skewed view of reality, 
<br>
fear not, it is a Bayesian Reasoner.  If reality changes for the FAI it 
<br>
will figure this out and adapt quickly.  If humans suddenly appear, 
<br>
this won't require years to figure out; the FAI will say &quot;Oh, look real 
<br>
humans.  Gee, I guess they act differently than my programmers said 
<br>
they did.  But, then my programmers were human and, from what I have 
<br>
observed about humans and what I know about seed AI development, I can 
<br>
understand why that happened.&quot;.  A Bayesian Reasoner cannot be totally 
<br>
screwed up by miseducation unless that miseducation takes away their 
<br>
rationality, meaning that they are no longer a Bayesian Reasoner.
