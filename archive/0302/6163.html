Dear SL4,
<br>
<p>Last month in the #sl4 chat channel, there was a discussion about
<br>
competitive games and whether we should teach a seed AI, or Friendly
<br>
Super Intelligence (FSI), about playing them.  One group was arguing
<br>
that we should not teach zero-sum, or competitive, games at all.
<br>
Another group thought it would be useful to do so.  I found myself
<br>
sympathizing with both viewpoints during the discussion, but have later
<br>
come down firmly on the 'openness' side of the argument.  Here are some
<br>
thoughts.
<br>
<p>Competitive Games
<br>
-----------------
<br>
It is not the competitiveness, epitomized in some human games that we
<br>
should avoid passing on to an FSI.  It is instantiating an
<br>
enjoyment/goal of zero sumness (or negative sumness) that should be
<br>
avoided.  In competitive games where the plainly written rules explain a
<br>
microworld of win-loose zero sumness, there is (almost always) an
<br>
unmentioned missing element.  This missing element is the enjoyment, the
<br>
diversion, the positive-sum *funness* that the humans experience when
<br>
playing.  This is much less culturally evident in U.S. society than it
<br>
is in European society... and therefore may not be immediately obvious
<br>
to thinkers with a U.S. based upbringing.  This human viewpoint should
<br>
be explained to an FSI.  The purpose of competitive games is co-equal
<br>
with that of non-competitive games, i.e. 'to have fun' and maybe learn
<br>
something.  That we can simultaneously want to have winners and losers
<br>
is an artifact of our human makeup, and an FSI must be able to
<br>
understand this.  After all, *we* understand it... therefore it cannot
<br>
be that difficult to grasp.
<br>
<p>Us Versus Them
<br>
--------------
<br>
It is not the 'us' versus 'them' meme that is a problem, it is the
<br>
sanctifying and demonizing that often follows that leads to zero
<br>
sumness.  Taking sides and competing is a good way for independent
<br>
actors to determine what works best, and have everyone profit by that.
<br>
It is convenient for humans to adopt this method because with a free
<br>
market system (of goods *and* ideas) individual selfishness works to
<br>
benefit society as a whole.  It is when the over-arching idea of 'common
<br>
goals' is ignored (or rejected) that different POVs ossify into
<br>
destructive memes.
<br>
<p>FSI Exposure
<br>
------------
<br>
We should not avoid exposing an FSI to competitive ideas in an attempt
<br>
to somehow channel the intellect into cooperative-only pathways.  Why
<br>
not?  Firstly, it would not work.  Even the most cursory examination of
<br>
human knowledge would reveal competition at every point.  Even the most
<br>
casual conversation with a normal human being will lead an FSI to
<br>
formulate the ideas of competitiveness and opposing
<br>
ideas/groups/opinions.  This information is not something that we should
<br>
avoid teaching to an FSI, but rather something we should concentrate on
<br>
explaining well.  &quot;Look at this,&quot; we should say.  &quot;This is how we have
<br>
made progress, and these are the reasons.&quot;  We should not shy away from
<br>
providing important information about humans, about what we have found
<br>
to work and not work.  We should show our successes and failures, and
<br>
our analysis of both, to an FSI.  We should not be saying, &quot;Don't look
<br>
there!&quot;.  Rather we should be saying, &quot;Check out this mess we made.
<br>
Don't make that mistake!  Here are three better paths, and we think
<br>
there are many more better paths.  Got any suggestions?&quot;.
<br>
