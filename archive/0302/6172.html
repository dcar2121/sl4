<em>&gt; Yes, what if?  This issue shares similar difficulties to that of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful technique is certain situations, as long as it is used as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subgoal in service of a larger positive-sum goal - such as the poker
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; taught only when the Seed AI can understand its utility in the larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive-sum context.
</em><br>
<p>Deception is lying, one of the last things we want a seed AI to start 
<br>
doing.  If it's capable of lying, we're in trouble and need to shut the 
<br>
AI down, if that's still possible.  Any games a Friendly seed AI plays 
<br>
must be non competitive and, more so, have no room for immoral 
<br>
techniques.  The only game an AI can play is the be-moral game (and its 
<br>
subgames, like the make-everybody-happy game), and even then we must be 
<br>
careful not to expose it to deception being employed by other players 
<br>
and pieces.  If you think about it more you'll see the only kind of 
<br>
game a Friendly seed AI can safely play isn't much of a game in human 
<br>
terms, but is still recognizable as a game.
<br>
<p>I think an adult FAI will be able to fully handle being exposed to 
<br>
people who lie without fear that it will start lying itself.  Until 
<br>
such time, demonstrating the effectiveness of lying could be deadly.
