<em>&gt; Whether we need to play games or not is still at question. [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have answered that question postively, for the following reasons.
<br>
<p>1) A game can be competitive, or non-competitive.  The degree of
<br>
competitivenes can be arbitrarily set in the design of the game.
<br>
<p>2) A game can be an analogy of reality, a model, within which:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;a) a Seed AI can learn skills and techniques...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and can be *seen* to learn them (or not).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;b) there are no negative real-world consequences
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to success/non-success (winning/losing).
<br>
<p>3) A game can be iterated, raising the level of difficulty at each
<br>
stage.
<br>
<p>4) A game can be re-interpreted in a new modality, fostering the
<br>
building of analogies.
<br>
<p>5) A game can embody an idea, or set of ideas, that can be referred back
<br>
to symbolically, assisting in the bootstrapping of language
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, even assuming we can develop a game free of conflict (I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can, but it's going to take a hell of a lot of work and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof of noncompetitiveness), it's still not clear that a seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI should be playing games at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Conflict and competitiveness in human societies are there for certain
<br>
reasons.  Some of these human reasons will be totally unsuitable for
<br>
inclusion in Seed AI games, as the Seed AI will not have human
<br>
psychology.  But to the extent that conflict/competition can be
<br>
effectively utilized by minds-in-general, these idea can be best
<br>
introduced to a Seed AI in the context of a game - with a positive-sum
<br>
purpose/reason **as an integral part of the game**.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A seed AI certainly needs some kind of training, but I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that sports/games as we think of them are going to be the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your phrase, &quot;as we think of them&quot; leads me to doubt we are talking
<br>
about the same definition for the word 'game'.  Here are a couple of
<br>
definitions I am using:
<br>
<p>game n. (Form of) contest played according to rules and decided by
<br>
skill, strength or luck. &lt;Concise Oxford&gt;
<br>
<p>game n. A competitive activity or sport in which players contend with
<br>
each other according to a set of rules. &lt;American Heritage&gt;
<br>
<p>The key aspects being: a) a contest b) within some rules c) producing an
<br>
outcome.  The human propensity to attach postive/negative judgements to
<br>
'winning' and 'losing' is not an elemental part of the game idea IMO.
<br>
An outcome of non-success, of 'losing', will often teach the contestent
<br>
more than winning.  If we take away the emotional baggage, a 'losing'
<br>
outcome is often positively useful in learning.  As long as the playing
<br>
of a game is taught to be a sub-subgoal of the subgoal: Learning, then
<br>
'winning' or 'losing' is incidental, and of little overall consequence.
<br>
As Ben Goertzel opined, teaching an AGI to play games could be entirely
<br>
a positive thing, as long as ve understands, &quot;it's just a game.&quot;
<br>
<p>At first, the competitiveness of the games presented should (IMO) be
<br>
very low or zero.  But as the Seed AI gains understanding of a wider
<br>
context, competitive elements can be added with confidence that they can
<br>
(and will) be explained in that wider context.  Competition can be a
<br>
learned technique that benefits all, players and non-players alike.
<br>
Instead of &quot;Ha! I win! I win! Now I can squash you like a bug!&quot; we would
<br>
have, &quot;Hoohoo! I win! Now let's apply this new technique to solving the
<br>
protein folding problem.&quot;
