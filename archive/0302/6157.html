Delurking, mostly becuase I have a free moment or two...

<em>&gt; Subject: the origin of subjective 'feelings'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Date: Thu, 6 Feb 2003 17:26:42 -0500
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I posted this on the wta-arts yahoo group today, I was wondering what your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts were on the topic it addresses.  the &gt;'ed paragraph is part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post I was replying to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As an example, I hear people speaking of there being &quot;new&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how can the viewers identify with the hero's &quot;plubertness&quot; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; niether they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nor the actor nor the director has the faintest idea what it means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plubertness or what it is? Be interesting, in a dramatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presentation, to see if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone could handle an invented &quot;new&quot; emotion in a reasonable way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting idea...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize this is tangential to the point of your post, but:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have serious doubts as to the possibility of 'new' emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (without radical changes in the brains architecture). Not that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is an unsurmountable technical barrier as such, but rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we already posess the full range of emotions 'possible' for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that is similar to our brain. As such, I think 'new'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions would only be a possibility once one's mind was 'running'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a structure quite unlike that of the natural human brain.
</em><br>
<p>Let's think about emotions functionally, that is, how they affect us.
<br>
If you are hungry, your behavior might change to include seeking food.
<br>
<p>If someone asks you out on a date, your emotional response will be
<br>
quite different if you are attracted to that person than if you are
<br>
not. 
<br>
<p>I think of emotions as putting people into states, like we're big fuzzy
<br>
Finite State Machines, and in these states, the likelihoods of various
<br>
behaviors are increased or decreased. Emotions may be compounded where
<br>
various states might exist simultaneously with varying degrees of
<br>
activation.
<br>
<p>In this framework, new emotions could either come from new structural
<br>
additions to one's mind, or perhaps a novel combination of already
<br>
known emotions could be considered a new emotion. Or perhaps there
<br>
are emotions you haven't felt yet. 
<br>
<p>I know that post-puberty and pre-puberty, my emotions were quite 
<br>
different and I'll hazard that so are everyone elses. If you agree, 
<br>
do you think we gained extra structures for them? I'm just curious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My reason for making these statements is my beliefs as to the nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of emotions. ask yourself: what is the cause of emotional responses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the human brain? The answer is rather simple in concept, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the details of it are still largely unknown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this isn't the place IMO for technical discussion of neuroscience,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so I'll cut to the chase :) I believe that when one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectively 'feels' emotions, what you are feeling is changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dynamic information patterns that is 'you'. SSRI's make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you 'feel' mentally balanced, but how can you feel a chemical? what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you feel is the changes in neural activity that the chemical induces.
</em><br>
<p>For information on the origin of emotions, the evolutionary psychologists/
<br>
authors: Cosmidies and Tooby, Steven Pinker, and Matt Ridley have all
<br>
been mentioned on this list. I've read Pinker and I just received a 
<br>
copy of The Adapted Mind for my birthday. Ridley's 
<br>
<p>The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation 
<br>
<p>was recommended by Eliezer and after reading it, I have to say I
<br>
found it very informative and interesting. Pinker's 
<br>
<p>How the Mind Works 
<br>
<p>has some great discussions of us as being emotional time bombs. It's
<br>
been a while since I've read the book, but I remember finding it
<br>
fascinating.
<br>
<p>Minsky's next work is supposed a book called _The Emotion Machine_.
<br>
It will probably be similar in style to _The Society of Mind_. This
<br>
will probably provide lots of intensely interesting, theories of the
<br>
functions of emotions.
<br>
<p>As for the subjective &quot;feeling&quot; of emotions. I have them and I find
<br>
them difficult to express, only because I'm fairly certain that the
<br>
other person I'm talking too, might not know exactly what I'm feeling.
<br>
I don't know what all the fuss about qualia are. I just avoid the
<br>
debate. Even my own feeling of hunger has changed. Now that I'm older
<br>
I distinctly feel faint and weak, whereas when I was younger, I recall
<br>
a strong desire building to go find food.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The gross architecture of neural activity patterns is similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 'normal' people; schizophrenics and others who are mentally ill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show significant deviation from baseline neural patterns. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept my arguments of the previous paragraphs, then it follows that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion is not intrinsic to the chemicals in your brain. And that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn suggests a certain universality of emotions...
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, if you really don't want a technical discussion of neuroscience,
<br>
this might not be a good paragraph :) I read The Chemical State of
<br>
Consciousness and from hearing about things like Prozac and other
<br>
&quot;mood altering drugs&quot; I'm sure there's a correlation with chemicals.
<br>
I saw a documentary about alcohol delaying the synapse fining in the
<br>
brain, so there is evidence (if it is right) that chemical and 
<br>
electrical activity are both involved in mood regulation.
