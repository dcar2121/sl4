<p><em>&gt; Dear SL4,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Last month in the #sl4 chat channel, there was a discussion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitive games and whether we should teach a seed AI, or Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Super Intelligence (FSI), about playing them.
</em><br>
<p>Inspired by the recent Deep Junior vs. Gary Kasparov chess matches, I have
<br>
revisited (skimmed) the chess programming literature and critiques of
<br>
machine approaches to gameplay.  Critics point to the game of Go
<br>
as too computationally complex for brute force look ahead.  So knowing
<br>
very little about this game I read the simple rules and visited some Go
<br>
web sites for more information.
<br>
<p>Here is a plan which I hope to get around to sometime:
<br>
<p>1. Gnu-Go is open source Go software and interfaces with the Go game
<br>
communication protocols, so I can get Go realtime interface code there.
<br>
<p>2. There are a couple of Java web client GUI's for Go that you can play on
<br>
the web and observe library Go games, and which interface to Gnu-Go or an application
<br>
I could program to comply with the Gnu-Go interface. This software gives
<br>
my potential application an interface onto the web Go gaming arenas.
<br>
<p>3. A compelling critique of computer game play is that the best programs
<br>
have a large body of hand crafted heuristics which they employ.  For
<br>
example in chess, the best programs have both a library of standard
<br>
openings and a hand crafted position evaluation function.  I leave aside
<br>
whether the library of endgame positions is a heuristic or simply a form
<br>
of memoization.  Critics say: &quot;Why doesn't a smart computer just take the
<br>
rules and learn the rest from game play experience?&quot;.  But programs taking
<br>
this approach have not turned out to be very good, and if I actually
<br>
pursue this task I'll have to examine these previous learning approaches
<br>
so as not to repeat their mistakes.  I want to give a Cyc application
<br>
the rules of Go and a large body of commonsense gaming skill and see what
<br>
develops.
<br>
<p>4. Although I am still just coding the initial stages of a NIST/RCS
<br>
hierarchical control structure as a Cyc application for automatic term
<br>
mapping, I have read and re-read James Albus' writings on this subject and
<br>
feel that his approach would lend itself to gameplay.  I am especially
<br>
intrigued by the pattern recognition required for Go expertise.
<br>
<p>5. The hierarchical control structure could easily be adapted for Go
<br>
gameplay I think.  Each layer should have about ten times the planning
<br>
time horizon of the lower levels and I think that the smallest unit of
<br>
resolution would be a single move.  So maybe three levels in the
<br>
hierarchy.  Albus writes about sensory perception and the creation of
<br>
more general patterns from those sensed in the lower level.   What would
<br>
be neat for me would be the chance to explore the pattern classification
<br>
algorithms available that could apply to the Go game-space.  If Cyc is to
<br>
exhibit more intelligent behavior then it must learn to  recognize salient
<br>
patterns, reifying them into symbolic concepts and extending Cyc's
<br>
ontology.  On the planning side, plan operators would have to be formed
<br>
at first from a description of the rules and then expanded from learned
<br>
good groupings of simpler operations and their applicable gameboard
<br>
situations.  Adversarial planning means recognizing the plans of your
<br>
opponent and this is something that we are just beginning to think
<br>
about at Cycorp.
<br>
<p>6. The commonsense body of knowledge of gameplay could be applicable to
<br>
any adversarial situation and hence might get DARPA funding someday.
<br>
Especially if Cyc is able to learn how to play Go just from the rules, the
<br>
general gameplay knowledge and learning from experience.
<br>
<p>7. I went ahead and ordered a Go board and stones - having them will be
<br>
a reminder to work on this.
<br>
<p>Speaking of DARPA, Ron Brachman's visit to Cycorp in December went well
<br>
and we have hopeful expectations that his DARPA office may employ Cyc
<br>
as a standard software for an upcoming funded program.  To further this
<br>
development, I would like to get some of my NIST/RCS style application
<br>
for automatic term mapping working in a couple of months for a compelling
<br>
demo of active Cyc intelligent behavior.
<br>
<p>My java programming work in progress continues to be committed to
<br>
SourceForge but is out of sync with the released OpenCyc image.  Cycorp
<br>
plans monthly releases of OpenCyc so I hope to get back in sync soon.
<br>
<p>I gave a brief talk on the Singularity to Cycorp last month and it was a
<br>
hit.  I plan a followup talk on the importance of Friendly AI and some
<br>
ways, as published by Eliezer, that it can be safely brought about.
