I posted this a few days ago on wta-arts, I think maybe some here will find it interesting :)
<br>
<p>&lt;
<br>
<p>There's a way to non-invasively suppress or excite arbitrary areas 
<br>
of the brain; <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/medical-vision/surgery/tms.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/medical-vision/surgery/tms.html</a>
<br>
<p>Called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, this device could allow an 
<br>
entirely new form of art to emerge. The breakneck pace of advance 
<br>
in neuroscience today shows no signs of doing anything other than 
<br>
getting even faster; already there are devices which can scan the 
<br>
brain that have sufficent resolution to roughly identify the 
<br>
emotional state(s) of a person.
<br>
<p>As both scanning and TMS devices improve, it seems inevitable that 
<br>
machines will be able to pinpoint with ease the exact emotions and 
<br>
feelings a person is experiencing, in real time.
<br>
<p>So you could record the neural activation patterns of a person who 
<br>
is experiencing emotions, and then play them back in the mind of 
<br>
another person. That's cool enough as is, but picture this:
<br>
<p>you map the various nuances of a single emotion to a musical 
<br>
instrument. each major emotion-type could be mapped in such a way...
<br>
And then you give these instruments to a symphony....
<br>
<p>1st, 2nd, and 3rd Cello would become 1st, 2nd and 3rd Love, or 
<br>
Happiness, or in darker piece, Fear or Anger. Or whatever, really.
<br>
<p><p><p>taken to it;s logical endpoint, this technology would presumably 
<br>
allow the activation of individual concepts, images, and memories in 
<br>
ones' mind...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>there's a lot of hastily made assumptions and probably errors in the above, but I think the overall idea of &quot;emotional art&quot; is a neat one.
