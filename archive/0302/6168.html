</em><br>

<p>Whether we need to play games or not is still at question.  It might be 
<br>
possible to design games that avoid competition and conflict, or design 
<br>
games where the objective is to avoid conflict, but this is a big 
<br>
stretch for a human (human sports/games are all competitive because 
<br>
there's no evolutionary need for sports that don't help expose the 
<br>
status of potential mates).  So, even assuming we can develop a game 
<br>
free of conflict (I think we can, but it's going to take a hell of a 
<br>
lot of work and a proof of noncompetitiveness), it's still not clear 
<br>
that a seed AI should be playing games at all.  A seed AI certainly 
<br>
needs some kind of training, but I'm not sure that sports/games as we 
<br>
think of them are going to be the best method.
