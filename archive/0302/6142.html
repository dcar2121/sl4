Greetings.... I've been lurking on this list for some time now and
<br>
Cosmodelia's recent posts (and their summary dismissal by most on the
<br>
list) stir me to post....
<br>
<p>What Cosmodelia brings up--about AGI's relating to music and having
<br>
feelings (like Jane)--points out what, to me, is a very important
<br>
piece of the AGI puzzle, as well as a huge gap in most approaches to
<br>
AI: spirit.
<br>
<p>Most AGI researchers/activists tend to base their approaches to AGI on
<br>
formal/mathematical/logical methods. Whether using methods famous in
<br>
the academic literature or fundamentally new and original ones, most
<br>
of these methods are rooted deeply in reason. In fact, I don't recall
<br>
a single approach to AI which isn't. What I wish to communicate these
<br>
logicocentric (term meant endearingly) researchers and activists is
<br>
that they're missing the BIG picture. The BIG picture is much larger
<br>
than reason--it is spirit--and it's missing in all but a few posts by
<br>
Cosmodelia, Ben, Samantha, and a book by Kurzweil.

</em><br>
<p>But, while the fact that the AI tradition has tended to frame &quot;reason
<br>
as everything&quot; is likely to be largely accepted, my next proposition
<br>
is not nearly as easy to swallow:
<br>
<p>I propose that *any* successful AGI design will be a design, instead
<br>
of in reason, *in the technology of spirit*.
<br>
<p>Now, by &quot;spirit&quot;, I don't mean the &quot;Let's go pray to lunar crystals&quot;
<br>
snake oil-kind. I mean a real, all-encompasing, perspective on what it
<br>
means to be.
<br>
<p>No doubt many AI'ers will claim spirit is irrelevant. No doubt some
<br>
will claim that spirit is an emergent property of general
<br>
intelligence. But I'm inclined (largely for rational reasons and
<br>
partly for intuition) to disagree. Regarding the first point, I don't
<br>
believe that spirit is irrelevant. Rather, I believe it is essential
<br>
to intelligence. You can't have AGI without human-GI's ability to
<br>
percieve spirit. Regarding the second point, I really doubt that
<br>
spirit could be an emergent property of AGI. How can the whole emerge
<br>
from the part unless the part already contains it?
<br>
<p>I'd love to see some serious treatment of this issue.
<br>
<p>Hasta que hay corazon en IA,
<br>
