Subject:	You are Cordially Invited to the Singularity Summit 2011 in New York
<br>
<p><p>I am writing to cordially invite you to the 6th annual Singularity Summit, to be held at the 92nd 
<br>
St. Y in New York City on October 15-16. 
<br>
<p>The Singularity Summit is the only conference that examines the full suite of transformative 
<br>
emerging technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and automation, which 
<br>
are transforming our lives on a daily basis. 
<br>
<p>In 2002, I predicted that by 2029 there would be artificial intelligence capable of lively and 
<br>
spontaneous conversation at the human level -- Turing Test passing AI. Earlier this year, the 
<br>
field moved closer to that goal when Watson, an IBM computer, defeated two human 
<br>
champions in the game show Jeopardy! On the show, Watson answered obscure Jeopardy! 
<br>
questions about topics as diverse as Lord of the Rings, Rock &amp; Roll, and abstract wordplay 
<br>
puzzles. 
<br>
<p>This year's Singularity Summit will be focused on the victory of Watson in Jeopardy! and what 
<br>
it means for the future of artificial intelligence. My talk, &quot;From Eliza to Watson to Passing the 
<br>
Turing Test&quot; will put Watson in the context of the history and future of conversational AI. Ken 
<br>
Jennings, the Jeopardy! champion who dominated the game for 74 consecutive matches in 
<br>
2004, only to lose to Watson in an epic battle of Man vs. Machine earlier this year, will 
<br>
discuss the details of his loss to the IBM computer. 
<br>
<p>Besides AI and robotics, many other topics will be addressed, including brain simulation, the 
<br>
economy, human enhancement, and neuroscience. A variety of eminent speakers will give 
<br>
talks -- neuroscientist Dr. Christof Koch, economist Tyler Cowen, cosmologist Max Tegmark, 
<br>
roboticists Robin Murphy and James McLurkin, investor Peter Thiel, television personalities 
<br>
Casey Pieretti and Jason Silva, and more. 
<br>
<p>You can register today at: <a href="http://www.singularitysummit.com/registration">http://www.singularitysummit.com/registration</a>
<br>
<p>The full speaker roster is at: <a href="http://www.singularitysummit.com/program">http://www.singularitysummit.com/program</a>
<br>
<p>The Singularity is the most world-altering and important event in history. If there is any global 
<br>
issue that is not getting the attention and discussion it deserves, it is the Singularity. Join 
<br>
other intellectual pioneers, business leaders, and scientists this October in New York to 
<br>
explore the Singularity and its manifold implications. 
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Ray Kurzweil
