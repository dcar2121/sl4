<p>&lt;&lt; For a technological optimist, I'm awfully pessimistic.  When I was
<br>
&nbsp;Eliezer's age, it was 1983.  It was clear to me, then, that by the year
<br>
&nbsp;2001, we'd have space colonies, artificially intelligent supercomputers,
<br>
&nbsp;self-reproducing nanotech assemblers, brain-computer interfaces,
<br>
&nbsp;holographic TV, cheap diamond, solar powered hydrogen production, a
<br>
&nbsp;worldwide hypertext system containing all human knowledge, photo-quality
<br>
&nbsp;computer graphics, and laptop computers.  We only got three out of
<br>
&nbsp;nine.  My experience is that almost anything new and exciting is wrong.
<br>
&nbsp;So my first response to any visionary proposal or exciting piece of news
<br>
&nbsp;is to explain why it will never amount to anything.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I have tended to be much more of a reader of technological forecasting 
<br>
(Herman Kahn and Marvin Cetron etc.) and have come late to the Singularity 
<br>
pursuit. In 2081, visionary, physicist Gerard K. ONeil said, &quot; Scientists 
<br>
almost always overestimate the  impact of new discoveries and always 
<br>
underestimate the impact of straightforward extensions of the capabilities of 
<br>
familiar technologies.&quot; Maybe Kamen's Ginger is a Stirling Engine of 
<br>
prodigious, efficiency? Stirling Engine, circa 1806.
<br>
<p>I am not saying that ONeil is always correct, just that he  serves as a 
<br>
reality check for those of us who read a science headline, and the wonder why 
<br>
technological miracles never seem to come about. I suspect this has been the 
<br>
period we have lived in where it was much more difficult to capitalize on 
<br>
technological developments because of their complexity. 
<br>
<p>Now that sensors and astronomically, more powerful, computers have come 
<br>
available, some of these technical developments have started to stir and 
<br>
provide results. Combinational chemistry for pharmaceutical researchers is 
<br>
effecting new drug testing and production significantly. Biological research, 
<br>
as anyone can see, is appearing to be hitting a take-off point, and not just 
<br>
with dramatic, &quot;clonning&quot; stories. This has been facilitated, primarilly with 
<br>
the use of advanced computers at the service of biochemists and molecular 
<br>
biologists. 
<br>
<p>My point is that computation seems now to be finally driving the basic 
<br>
research to actual technological ends, rather then laying moribund in some 
<br>
cabinet.
