<p>Depending on how you frame your assumptions, you get different answers at
<br>
this point.  Assuming that individual volition holds, it's hard to imagine
<br>
all of humanity being moved into VR... not without them being asked
<br>
first.  And it isn't necessarily true that even the transhumanists would
<br>
walk into Diaspora within the first few seconds - there are friends and
<br>
relatives who may get left behind, and once you're a transhuman, you may
<br>
not be allowed to stick around on persuading people - or rather, the
<br>
people on Earth may not want to talk to you.
<br>
<p>The last freedom - literally the last, because invariably fatal - is
<br>
freedom from the Singularity itself.  That doesn't just mean staying
<br>
behind on Earth; it means refusal to be exposed to transhumans or to
<br>
transhuman ideas.  It means continuing, more or less, with your old life. 
<br>
There are some people who will want that.  Transhuman means transhumanly
<br>
persuasive... a superintelligence could simply take over a human mind
<br>
given realtime bandwidth, maybe even take over a mind using a memetic
<br>
proxy (ultra-appealing religions, say).  Is Old Earth simply to become the
<br>
battleground for people being pushed this way and that by warring radio
<br>
messages from Luna?  I don't think that's what the Pedestrians of Old
<br>
Earth will want.  But the implication is that once you're a full-flowered
<br>
transhuman, you may not be able to talk to the stay-behinds, even people
<br>
who want to talk to you, because then the people who talk to you can't
<br>
talk to anyone else.  If you want to stick around on Old Earth and see if
<br>
you can get your conservative parents to come with you, it means that you
<br>
may need to hold off on the transcendence for a while.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how this works out.  I used to think it would just be a mass
<br>
upload followed by a mass upgrade, but that was on the objective morality
<br>
paradigm.  In the Sysop Scenario, the dominant force in the universe is
<br>
volition, and that creates the possibility of commonsense solutions,
<br>
compromises, not the extreme cases that I instinctively feel are more
<br>
realistic.  In an extreme case, there's some kind of rush and no
<br>
milliseconds to waste; all the transhumans vanish instantly and all the
<br>
Pedestrians and Undecided stay behind, untouched, possibly even a bit
<br>
confused (though hopefully it should be obvious enough what happened).  In
<br>
a highly extreme case, everyone, including the Pedestrians, vanishes into
<br>
the Transcend whether they like it or not.  In a compromise solution...
<br>
what happens next will be whatever least violates Earth's massed
<br>
volitions, including our volitions about how conflicting volitions should
<br>
be dealt with, and what is or isn't fair methods of persuasion during the
<br>
Transition period.
<br>
<p>What do I mean by a &quot;commonsense&quot; solution?  I mean one in which
<br>
second-order moral imperatives are applied with room for slack, rather
<br>
than being absolute.  By &quot;second-order&quot;, I refer not to basic
<br>
Friendliness, but to consequences of Friendliness - for example, the idea
<br>
that Old Earth needs to be kept free of coercive transhuman memes, and
<br>
thus the idea that transhumans and humans shouldn't interact.
<br>
<p>The following scenario is a bit Lothlorien, so I distrust it... but to
<br>
continue working out the consequences:  The transhumanists don't instantly
<br>
become superintelligences - most of them don't, anyway - but they do stop
<br>
losing neurons due to aging.  Cognitive enhancement proceeds at a very
<br>
slow pace, the natural or irreduceable level of improvement that comes
<br>
from aging without dying.  If a transhumanist wanted to stick around on
<br>
Old Earth for a millennium it might get dicey, but the Transition
<br>
presumably ends, and Old Earth is handed off exclusively to the
<br>
Pedestrians, in five or twenty years rather than a thousand.  Meanwhile,
<br>
the gently transhuman transhumanists are slowly creeping up the gaussian
<br>
curve, but are not yet directly outside it; so by commonsense, slacky
<br>
application of the second-order rules, gently transhuman transhumanists
<br>
don't pose a contamination threat to the Earth culture the Pedestrians
<br>
will inherit.  Similarly, the gentle transhumans can't instantly turn into
<br>
physical supermen or start casting magical spells; that's probably outside
<br>
the range of what the remaining Pedestrians will want to remember in their
<br>
legends.
<br>
<p>Sticking around on Old Earth to persuade your friends doesn't mean
<br>
volunteering to die, or even to get hurt, so some degree of physical
<br>
invulnerability would appear to be necessary - but then, there's more than
<br>
one way to play that.  If the remaining Pedestrians are willing to
<br>
tolerate legends of invulnerability, then OK, guns don't fire or
<br>
whatever.  An alternative would be that your body suffers the expected
<br>
physical damage but you just rematerialize a few milliseconds later
<br>
(presumably out of the line of fire).  Obviously, this kind of freedom
<br>
implies that a gentle transhuman is also willing to accept that the Sysop
<br>
won't let him or her get into fights with the Pedestrians (it's a bit
<br>
unfair if they can die permanently and you can't).  Eating?  Going to the
<br>
bathroom?  And what happens to the economy when a third of the population
<br>
no longer needs a job?  The Sysop can stabilize it easily enough, but only
<br>
if the Pedestrian volition is to temporarily accept that kind of
<br>
existence.
<br>
<p>The commonsense solution to the child problem is that children can't die
<br>
or be hurt (or lose neurons, but they're not losing many anyway) until the
<br>
child is old enough to choose freely; Pedestrian parents can try and
<br>
persuade the child to become a Pedestrian and die, but the child also gets
<br>
exposed to the &quot;techno&quot; point of view (at a human level of persuasiveness,
<br>
not a transhuman level).  Hopefully very few children will grow up to be
<br>
Pedestrians; those that do will have made a genuinely free choice.
<br>
<p>To some extent, this is a scenario that I worked out for possible use in
<br>
science fiction... it feels too normal and sane to be real, somehow; too
<br>
much like self-indulgent fantasy.  But perhaps that very self-indulgence
<br>
means that the scenario is more likely to happen.  It's not SL4... but
<br>
maybe Old Earth doesn't want SL4.  Maybe Earth wants a commonsense,
<br>
flexible, non-strict set of solutions to all the various dilemnas that pop
<br>
up during the Transition period.  That's the only fundamental reason that
<br>
would allow something so Lothlorien, with so much story potential, to
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>My concern in such matters is to minimize the number of people who stay
<br>
behind, but the degree to which potential Pedestrians can be persuaded
<br>
depends on what their massed volition says is OK as a means of persuasion.
