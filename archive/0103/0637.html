<p>This is interesting and worth the read.  It explains many of the 
<br>
ideas I was talking about in detail with more proof than I wanted to 
<br>
deal with in e-mails.  Saves me from writing a paper.  :-)
<br>
<p>One thing that it still ignores mostly is the potential for the mind 
<br>
as just one genus of many intelligences.  It is easy to gloss over 
<br>
this idea, since any non mind intelligence will have no clear way to 
<br>
communicate with us.  For example, let's look at the Aspyr game Alpha 
<br>
Centauri.  In the game, there are these worm like creatures all over 
<br>
Planet.  As it turns out, these worms have collective consciousness. 
<br>
The worms for clumps that can act in a meaningful way, like attacking 
<br>
something threatening.  When there are enough of them on Planet, the 
<br>
entire planet is convered with the worms and the planet becomes 
<br>
intelligent.  This, however, is a not a mind, no more than a coral 
<br>
reef is a mind.  Signs of intelligence are shown (the simple problems 
<br>
that small clumps of worms could solve can be employed when the hard 
<br>
problems that the worm covered planet has to deal with), though. 
<br>
Given enough time, the worms would develop complex technology and 
<br>
transcend.  Thus, here we have another kind of intelligent system 
<br>
reaching the paragon of intelligence.
<br>
<p>So, here is the latest version of my hypothesis.  There is a paragon 
<br>
mind, and we are on our way to reaching that point.  Eventually, 
<br>
though, we will find that there are constraints to minds and we will 
<br>
have to move on to being a general intelligence.  When we reach the 
<br>
paragon intelligence, we will be able to look back and see minds and 
<br>
realize other genuses of intelligent systems (we may be able to infer 
<br>
some of the other genuses of intelligent systems, as I have done 
<br>
above, before then).  Due to Future Fog, we can only see so far out 
<br>
right now, but when we reach paragon intelligence, we'll be able to 
<br>
look out and possibly see more general areas to move into. 
<br>
Hopefully, a paragon mind will be able to look beyond paragon 
<br>
intelligence, if possible at all.
<br>
<p>As a human who is still yet to transcend, I'm a rather imperfect 
<br>
mind.  Paragon is where I'm trying to get to now, and when I'm there 
<br>
I'll worry about the next step.  Actually, depending on the rate of 
<br>
self enhancement, it may be possible to reach the paragon of 
<br>
intelligence without realizing the stepping stone of paragon mind 
<br>
except as an afterthought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is also Richard Dawkin's claim (paraphrasing) that: &quot;If life were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to evolve on another planet, it would evolve by Darwinian evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(the kind we've seen on Earth).&quot; -- This is probably not worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speculating about since there aren't any really good contenders to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory that I've seen, but interesting to ponder, none-the-less.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't strickly SL4, but there are theories of evolution other 
<br>
than Darwin's based on different facts (Spencer's comes to mind, 
<br>
which developed independly).  All of them focus around the same 
<br>
central idea (survival of the fittest), but there are subtle 
<br>
differences that have profound effects.
