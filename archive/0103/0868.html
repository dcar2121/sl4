<p>I thought this was a nice rest from going yet another round on Friendly AI

- and it does matter.

<p>Oh, come on, I'm not *that* bad a writer.  I already told you that I gave
<br>
it my best.  Is there some technique I don't know about?  Some particular
<br>
piece of writing that you feel solves the problem perfectly using an
<br>
absorbable method?  Because otherwise, I understand that you want me to be
<br>
a better writer, but you haven't told me how.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; English is semantically complete
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructions of any kind.
</em><br>
<p>If English were semantically complete in this area, feminists around the
<br>
English-speaking world would have been using &quot;it&quot; for the human indefinite
<br>
pronoun for the last forty years.  The fact that they haven't - that
<br>
they've even resorted to constructions such as &quot;he/she&quot; or &quot;they
<br>
(singular)&quot; - means that &quot;it&quot; is simply not accepted as a viable reference
<br>
to humans.  This is because of both the anaphoric and the &quot;dumb matter&quot;
<br>
uses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nor does 'it' connote &quot;dumb matter&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either, in a great many common uses!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Knock! Knock!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Who is it?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's the super, I've come to fix the sink.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is &quot;it&quot; the superintendent, or a superintelligence?  :-) Either way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't find this construction awkward -- it's the most common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction in this context.
</em><br>
<p>In the example you gave, &quot;it&quot; is used as an anaphor.  Not a pronoun.
<br>
<p>You can see this very readily by trying to substitute &quot;he&quot; in the sentence
<br>
above.  Broken sentence, right?  Try to substitute &quot;this&quot; and it works
<br>
fine.
<br>
<p>So of course &quot;it&quot; doesn't connote dumb matter in that instance; it isn't
<br>
even being used as a pronoun.  The fact that &quot;it&quot; can be used in this way
<br>
is itself the largest problem with using &quot;it&quot; as a pronoun in complex
<br>
sentences.
<br>
<p>--              --              --              --              --
