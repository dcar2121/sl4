<p>I guess that my part of the universe must be very differnt from 
<br>
yours.  When I first came across a document using the v pronouns, I 
<br>
adopted them immediately.  After just a paragraph I had no trouble 
<br>
using them.  It just seemed obvious to me what they were for and at 
<br>
the time I had not read anything else that used them.  I think that I 
<br>
was only stopped the first time I read ve, because I had to think of 
<br>
what this word could be for, but I soon realized and moved on.  I 
<br>
guess that other people must just do the same (or at in some places).
<br>
<p>Also, when I've explained the v pronouns to people, many have liked 
<br>
the idea.  It makes it much easier to talk about a person in general 
<br>
without having to think about gender issues.  He makes me think male, 
<br>
she female, and ve, neutral.  Plus, they're a real life saver when 
<br>
you know someone's name but because they are of a different 
<br>
nationality can't tell gender from the name.
<br>
<p>Maybe we should compare demographics.  The people I associate with 
<br>
are generally other students near my age, teachers, and the people I 
<br>
program with on projects over the Internet.
<br>
<p>I have only ever had one negative response to using v pronouns, and 
<br>
it was making fun of me, thinking that I made a typo or was writing 
<br>
in germanish-english.
<br>
<p>Finally, to be honost, I find it pretty amazing myself that people 
<br>
could read past v pronouns, but I have had several people do this on 
<br>
me.
