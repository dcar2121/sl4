<p>Has anyone considered the possibility of using simulations to generate 
<br>
offspring?  Brief thought on the subject makes me think that spawning *new* 
<br>
life after the Singularity might be difficult.  Can you imagine a 3 year 
<br>
old (our relative time frame) with godlike capability?  And how would a 3 
<br>
year old communicate with super intelligence?  I suppose they could start 
<br>
new beings at a more advanced stage, but then is it really new or is some 
<br>
of the underlying mentality just reworked?  I've been thinking that the 
<br>
simple answer (certainly not from *our* perspective) may be to just 
<br>
simulate the pre-singularity world and have them evolve into AI like we 
<br>
will/have.
<br>
<p>If that is at all probable, then this is the ideal time frame to 
<br>
simulate.  Starting the simulation off around 1960-1970 produces a large 
<br>
batch of 30-50 year olds who evolve (assuming it hits in 2010).  I would 
<br>
further assume that if this is the case they have identified the ideal 
<br>
transition (average) age in consideration of moral / social / intellectual 
<br>
development.
<br>
<p>Everyone else in the simulation (not ripe for conversion) could be either 
<br>
based on our &quot;parents&quot; as they were pre-singularity or would, I assume, be 
<br>
somehow transferred to another simulation if they are too young to make the 
<br>
transition in this one.
<br>
<p>By the way, has anyone given any thoughts to what happens to kids when we 
<br>
discover the Singularity?  I've put a hold on the possibility of our having 
<br>
kids for the moment due to this line of thought.  Assuming we are in the 
<br>
*real* world and will be the first to get to the singularity, I am fairly 
<br>
worried about what happens to individuals deemed too young to evolve.  Has 
<br>
anyone else thought about this?
