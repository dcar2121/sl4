<p>Now, I've had totally different experiences.  In fact, I've found 
<br>
that I have to point out the use of gender neutral pronouns for them 
<br>
to notice it.  In fact, I've regularly used them in e-mails with one 
<br>
friend for several months now and only recently, when I brought up 
<br>
the issue, did she let me know that she hadn't even noticed!  No one 
<br>
I know even seems to care when I do use them, they just read on and 
<br>
if I bring up the subject they are rather apathetic (the most 
<br>
response I've gotten was that the guy noticed what I was doing but 
<br>
quickly realized that they were pronouns and accepted it as something 
<br>
new that he just didn't know about).
<br>
<p>Here is another way to look at it.  My mom has a Mac, but she didn't 
<br>
even notice when the Mac OS started using NeXT style scroll bars 
<br>
instead of regular scroll bars.  When I brought it up, she said she 
<br>
had noticed that something was different and upon inspection realized 
<br>
what it was, but otherwise went on living her computer life.  Such a 
<br>
change might seem like a big deal to those of us involved deeply in 
<br>
the issue, but the rest of the world isn't concerned at all.  The 
<br>
average person just accepts what ve is given.
