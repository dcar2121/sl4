</em><br>
<p>The question I am now pondering is what the anthropomorphic implications
<br>
of using &quot;she&quot; would be, and whether there's anything too obnoxious that
<br>
will fall out of it.  Likewise for giving AIs names like &quot;Aileen&quot; instead
<br>
of &quot;Ailerin&quot;.
<br>
<p>It would be depressing to see male critics starting to accuse the
<br>
femininely pronouned Sysop of well-meant maternal interference instead of
<br>
paternalistic dominance.  Funny, but depressing.  It mean that the
<br>
aforesaid critics were not just wrong, but predictably and boringly
<br>
wrong.  It would also mean that males (and females?) had been
<br>
unconsciously anthropomorphizing male stereotypes to minds in general,
<br>
even when &quot;ve&quot; or &quot;it&quot; were used, and thus that the whole
<br>
gender-neutrality effort had been doomed from the start.
<br>
<p>I don't know what the effects would be on the female audience, if any.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we truly believe that Singularity will end all suffering is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unethical to not select memes that will aid acceptance of Singularity? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose by this I mean the way of presenting facts, certainly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsifying evidence or covering up facts.
</em><br>
<p>What worries me is that if I thought humanity would still be
<br>
pre-Singularity in a hundred years, I would use gender-neutral pronouns
<br>
and damn the torpedoes, on the grounds that we'd have to get used to it
<br>
eventually.  That won't happen.  But if I decide not to use gender-neutral
<br>
pronouns, it will be a decision that directly depends on my belief that
<br>
I'm planning for this generation, and not someone's grandchildren.  And
<br>
every time I make a decision like that, a little more &quot;normal&quot; burns away.
<br>
<p>The fact that I spend my life dealing with long-term problems does give me
<br>
enough social slack to drop a fringe long-term problem in somebody else's
<br>
lap rather than taking care of it myself.  But I'm still reluctant.
