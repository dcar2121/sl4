<p>
As I see it the following points have been made in reply to my original 
<br>
question:
<br>
<p>1. Currently the military probably regard SI as too far out to merit 
<br>
serious attention
<br>
2. As SI draws closer, the military will get about it independently of our 
<br>
policy
<br>
<p>I agree with both these points but they don't really answer whether we 
<br>
should try to do our little bit in promoting awareness among the military.
<br>
<p>3. Eliezer claimed that SI has no military applications
<br>
<p>I think this is too categorical. Maybe the designers' experience with a 
<br>
gradually growing AI will persuade them to adopt some reasonable ethical 
<br>
standards, which may then converge into Friendliness as the SI matures. But 
<br>
I can't be completely confident that this will happen. Moreover, from the 
<br>
point of somebody with non-reasonable ethical views, the prospect of 
<br>
&quot;friendly&quot; SI could be seen as a military threat. &quot;What will happen to our 
<br>
religious revolution if those guys develop what they call a friendly (but 
<br>
probably ungodly) SI?&quot;
<br>
<p>4. Eliezer hopes that there will not be an SI arms race.
<br>
<p>Ok, so presumably the more awareness there is of SI the greater the 
<br>
likelihood of arms race. But
<br>
<p>5. Eliezer also hopes that if there is an arms race then &quot;protect America&quot; 
<br>
will be a subgoal of &quot;serve humanity&quot;
<br>
<p>And we might think that THIS is more likely given that there has been long 
<br>
awareness and discussion.
<br>
<p>So what's been said doesn't really answer the original question. Now my 
<br>
intuition that it is better if the military knows results from the 
<br>
heuristic: When in doubt, promote public discussion.
<br>
<p>BTW, since this is my debut at SL4 I ought perhaps to introduce myself.
