<em>&gt; Well, when you get to the point of, say, discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not one should be a Platonist, you may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to do some retooling. I would be very surprised
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if whatever representational system you're using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the capacity to express even just all the *known*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies. But if you're adding fundamental new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicates to your AI's knowledge representation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language, that seems a little drastic to be called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'education'.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, any representational system that has equivalent power
<br>
to higher-order predicate logic, has the capability to express any
<br>
known philosophy.
<br>
<p>It might be true that in some representational systems, some philosophies
<br>
are much
<br>
more compactly represented or efficiently manipulated than others.
<br>
<p>But, this seems not to be true to me.  It seems that the representational
<br>
systems used in AI's
<br>
exist at a significantly lower level than philosophies, so that most
<br>
representational systems one might use,
<br>
could represent basically any philosophy with roughly equal ease.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the main point of making 'philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophistication' a design principle up there with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness and modularity is to avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brute-force imposition of incorrect 'solutions'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by locked-in philosophical errors.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I sort of see your point.
<br>
<p>Friendliness is a combination of a design principle and
<br>
something that must be instilled through education.
<br>
<p>Clearly, by design, one could create a system inclined to be
<br>
aggressive like a tiger, or one inclined to be friendly, but education
<br>
and proper experience are needed to make these inclinations functionally
<br>
integrated with emergent system intelligence.
<br>
<p>But, I still think that  philosophy is ~mostly~ going to be induced by
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p>For instance, one could create a system that was inclined to be a
<br>
solipsist --
<br>
by giving it sense organs for a while and using them to teach it, and then
<br>
removing
<br>
the sense organs, for example.  Or one could create a system that was
<br>
inclined to
<br>
believe reality is what you make it, by raising it in a virtual world that
<br>
it could
<br>
morph using its thoughts.
<br>
