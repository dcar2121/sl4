</em><br>

<p>One far-out possibility is that it turns out that it is possible to &quot;tunnel&quot;
<br>
out of our universe into whatever is &quot;above&quot; it, and that the other adjacent
<br>
universes have physics that make for better computing (or some other major
<br>
advantage). Then we get to them, and find out that all the previous SIs
<br>
have already gotten there first. (ripped out of Diaspora)
<br>
<p>Other possibles are that the lightspeed barrier is not breakable, in which
<br>
case no one nearby may have even realized we are here yet. (unlikely... you'd
<br>
think they would have tech all scattered about the galaxy and woulda known
<br>
about our planet billions of years ago) I have a hard time coming up with
<br>
a reason that &quot;hidden SIs&quot; would sit around and watch us evolve without
<br>
revealing themselves. Unless it's some bizarre form of entertainment for
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>I think it does make sense that the Sysop might try to explore the galaxy
<br>
itself just to check it out, but who knows.. it might decide to wait here
<br>
in the solar system for a little bit until it thinks it has maxed out its
<br>
intelligence per quark just in case it runs into something nasty.
<br>
<p>If there is no detectable intelligent life besides us in this galaxy, and
<br>
apparently no where it could have gone (other universes, etc.), that makes
<br>
me strongly believe we are in a simulation. But on the other hand the
<br>
increasing evidence of dead life on Mars would seem to point the other
<br>
way... in which case- where the heck are they?
