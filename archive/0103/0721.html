</em><br>
<p>Actually, I must admit I have been curious about this myself.  I, too, am 
<br>
an atheist as so I'm not terribly familiar with revelations.  But a friend 
<br>
of mine mentioned that this sounded similar when I was discussing it with 
<br>
him.  So I had planned to peruse revelations sometime in the future just to 
<br>
check.  If the text of revelations can be applied pretty closely to the 
<br>
Singularity then there are 3 primary theories:
<br>
<p>1) pure coincidence
<br>
2) As mentioned, we may actually be in a simulation.  In such a case this 
<br>
makes perfect sense.
<br>
3) Assuming we are not the only intelligent life in the universe, there are 
<br>
SIs out there.  Which means, given unlimited technology and life span, they 
<br>
have been here.  So maybe they give low-tech intelligent life they find a 
<br>
little push in the right direction.  Religion has been responsible for some 
<br>
horrible things (crusades, inquisition, etc) but, on the whole, it gave 
<br>
people something to strive for and some &quot;nice&quot; rules to live by.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;   The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     fact that a story exists and is patently false does not provide data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     the truth of unrelated projections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But is it a fact that the story in question is patently false?If you plan 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on creating God(i.e.,an all-knowing,all-powerful Sysop),you should at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least be open to the idea that someone else may have beaten you to the punch.
</em><br>
<p>By the way, the similarity between the general definition of &quot;God&quot; and a SI 
<br>
is incredibly close.  I spent a good half hour trying to really explain 
<br>
what a SI would be capable of to my wife for near half an hour.  The I 
<br>
realized this and said it is the closest thing to &quot;God&quot; as we can possibly 
<br>
imagine, which worked.
<br>
<p>Sorry if I'm rehashing Extropian views or something but I've never read the 
<br>
Extropian list.  Besides, this is pointedly on topic (SL4).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Eliezer,I dearly hope that this isn't taken as anything thing more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gentle discourse.I have nothing but the highest respect for you,and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everyone else who takes the time to post here.Thanks for reading,and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;please continue stimulating my tiny,pre-transhuman brain.
</em><br>
<p>Ditto.  Besides I have a friend who has met Eliezer and says he is &quot;often&quot; 
<br>
correct.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.  Chris, don't let that keep you from posting in the future.  Actually, 
<br>
if you have the time (I don't) you could research Revelations to see if it 
<br>
can be interpreted in this way.  If it can't then that cleanly ends the 
<br>
discussion.  I'm curious, in the least.
