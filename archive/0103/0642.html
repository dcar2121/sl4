<p>Today, this is certainly true.  But the whole point of singularity-thinking,
<br>
of thinking about the implications of Moore's Law carried out for just another
<br>
20-30 years, is that machines of this level of capability will become relatively
<br>
_cheap_.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You overlook the combat strengths of light infantry in a theater of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have low firepower, modest speed, and are poorly armored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, they have the enormous value of being extraordinarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptive to changing conditions, very resistant to the environment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far more durable than machines, and capable of operating with very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little logistical support.
</em><br>
<p>You certainly have a point here, no question about that.
<br>
<p>But let's think about what might be possible with computers at 1,000
<br>
or 100,000 or 1,000,000 times the power of our current computers *per
<br>
dollar spent*.  I'm not sure what shape things will take, of course.
<br>
I'm just saying that it seems obvious to me that having _smarter_
<br>
machinery is going to have important military implications.
<br>
<p>I have an autofocus 35 millimeter camera, the Canon Rebel 2000.  I can
<br>
operate it in full manual mode, which allows me to do some artistic
<br>
things (within the limits of my very limited talents!).  But I can also
<br>
put it in full-auto mode.  In that mode, it takes dozens of measurements
<br>
in the blink of an eye, and sets the focus and shutter speed according to
<br>
an internal algorithm.  It doesn't just take a single measurement, but
<br>
measures different spots in the field of view and attempts to guess at what
<br>
it is that I'm trying to shoot.
<br>
<p>It isn't perfect, but it is fast and pretty damn good.  It is a lot faster
<br>
than I am.
<br>
<p>Now think of a super advanced 50 caliber machine gun, 15-30 years from
<br>
now, which contains a computer 1,000,000 times more powerful than your
<br>
desktop PC, costing roughly the same as an *existing* 50 caliber
<br>
machine gun today.  
<br>
<p>We aren't going to ask that it be a full-blown AI, or anything like
<br>
that.  The soldier carries it around like a regular machine gun, but
<br>
it has a 'full-auto' mode like the mode on my camera.  When the soldier
<br>
pulls the trigger and start spraying bullets, the gun actually times
<br>
the firing of the bullets with an eye towards actually hitting hostiles
<br>
and actually trying to miss friendlies.
<br>
<p>That requires a lot of intelligence.  It requires a serious ability to
<br>
do visual discrimination, and a lot of thought has to go into reducing
<br>
false positives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Even a machine with the mental capabilities of a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be at an extraordinary disadvantage from a logistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standpoint and would likely only be used in very limited scenarios
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where such a machine could be safely supported.  While humans may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have the armor of machines, we tend to be far more durable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage resistant than machines, and of course, are self-repairing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and for the most part self-supplying.  The trend has therefore been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to augment human abilities; it is cheaper and more effective for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many military missions.  -James Rogers <a href="mailto:jamesr@best.com?Subject=Re:%20Military%20applications%20of%20SI">jamesr@best.com</a>
</em><br>
<p>I agree with everything you say here.
<br>
<p>The only thing I would point out is that &quot;intelligence&quot; need not mean
<br>
&quot;the mental capabilities of a human&quot;.  Machine intelligence need not be
<br>
as smart as a full human being, in order to defeat us at certain high-speed
<br>
specialized tasks... like auto-focus and auto-shutter-speed on a camera.
<br>
<p>But I do agree that intelligent military machines will not _in the
<br>
immediate future_ take the form of super killing machines, but will
<br>
instead be intelligent augments to the existing systems.
<br>
<p>My only general point is that I see military implications for AI, all the way
<br>
up the chain.  Cool, clear-headed rational thought (particularly specialized
<br>
thought about identifying hostiles and friendlies) is something that machines
<br>
can provide on the battlefield.
