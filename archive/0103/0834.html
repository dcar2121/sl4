Compare:
<br>
<p>&quot;Jimmy started it when he said that gender-neutral writing shouldn't be
<br>
difficult or confusing, and that, though it might represent a problem for
<br>
inexperienced writers, he was pretty sure that it wasn't that hard to
<br>
handle.&quot;
<br>

<p>&quot;Jimmy started it when Jimmy said that gender-neutral writing shouldn't be
<br>
difficult or confusing, and that, though it might represent a problem for
<br>
inexperienced writers, Jimmy was pretty sure that it wasn't that hard to
<br>
handle.&quot;
<br>
<p>Except that now it looks like Jimmy is talking about Jimmy in the third
<br>
person, which isn't the case.  We expect an pronoun to be used here;
<br>
otherwise there's an actual semantic change.
<br>
<p><p>I could rewrite it like this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Jimmy started this whole thing off by saying that gender-neutral writing
<br>
shouldn't be difficult or confusing, and that, though there might be a
<br>
problem for inexperienced writers, it was pretty sure the problem could be
<br>
handled.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>I'm sure this is what Jimmy, John, and Peter have in mind.  And in fact,
<br>
that's what I tried doing back when in CaTAI 1.0 when this whole thing
<br>
started.  The problem is twofold.  First, it started to grate on my
<br>
nerves.  I'm not sure you realize how annoying it is to have to avoid
<br>
using the word &quot;it&quot; in every sentence for fear it might be confusing; and
<br>
then, even when you do get to use &quot;it&quot; as an AI pronoun, the readers still
<br>
need to stop and think for a few seconds to decide whether &quot;it&quot; is being
<br>
used as an anaphor or a pronoun.  I know that ve, ver, and vis may throw
<br>
readers off their stride... but it's a problem that gets better with time,
<br>
not worse.  Once the reader gets used to it, there's no longer any
<br>
ambiguity.
<br>
<p>Second, the longer a sentence is, the harder it is to rewrite.  Breaking
<br>
up the sentence into multiple subsentences does not help significantly;
<br>
sure, you can use proper names or &quot;the AI&quot; more often if you start a new
<br>
sentence each time, but sooner or later it still starts to grate on the
<br>
nerves.  It's the structure of references that matter.  Not how many
<br>
sentences are used to implement that structure.  The number of anaphoric
<br>
references remains constant, and if you try to name your variables each
<br>
time, the reader has to take just a little bit more time on each occasion
<br>
to realize that when you say &quot;the problem&quot; you are referring to the
<br>
previous problem, and not a new problem.  An anaphor or pronoun is a word
<br>
that does that automatically.
<br>
<p>I can no longer recall which specific paragraph it was that finally broke
<br>
me, but there was one.  I successfully rewrote it, but at the cost of
<br>
making the paragraph too hard to read.  So I broke down and used &quot;ve&quot;.
<br>
<p>The problem can be solved, but not without actually affecting the mental
<br>
imagery built up by the reader.  Comprehension suffers.  That's not a
<br>
price I'm willing to pay.  I'd rather use grammatically straightforward
<br>
sentences with a &quot;off&quot; words than use grammatically &quot;off&quot; sentences with
<br>
conventional words.
