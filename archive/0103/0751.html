&nbsp;yards or tribbles)) &gt;&gt;
<br>
Sounds like check-in time at Hilbert's Hotel
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If you had created me as a simulation, you could not (as in &quot;would not
<br>
be able to&quot;) hurt me because the Sysop will prevent it. So if you keep
<br>
creating sentient beings which you cannot erase, at some point you
<br>
might run into resource problems, yes? Have I made the problem clear?
<br>
There are obvious solutions: each new sentience must have a guaranteed
<br>
amount of computational resources to pursue, life, liberty and
<br>
happiness, blah, blah, blah. &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>To become the Primary Sysop, one would have to technologically be able to 
<br>
manipulate all varients of phase space, although a local-universe Sysop would 
<br>
do nicely for our purposes.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;If Friendliness protects all sentients, simulated or otherwise, then
<br>
the world as we live in it now, cannot be a simulation run under the
<br>
rules of Friendliness...or that is one conclusion anyway. I thought I
<br>
could bring together the ideas of being in a simulation with our
<br>
notion of Friendliness. When I did, I found a big conflict which 
<br>
surprised me.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Let's not make what is &quot;perfection&quot; the antagonist of what is vastly, better, 
<br>
then what seems to exist currently. Setting painlessness as a paradigm is not 
<br>
exactly the the royal route to the pits of hell.
