<p>This is a very ambitious statement.  Maybe any philosophy within 20th-century
<br>
Anglo-American analytic philosophy could be represented by higher-order
<br>
predicate calculus (HOPC).  But consider the following examples:
<br>
<p>-- Zen Buddhism can only be learned by spending a very long time meditating.
<br>
<p>-- Kabbalism should only be learned by married men over 40, as less mentally
<br>
sturdy people might damage their minds when they learn it.
<br>
<p>-- &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot; by Deleuze and Guattari is designed to
<br>
baffle the reader into a position where they realize nothing is knowable and
<br>
everything is a matter of interpretation.  (Or something like that-- it's open
<br>
to interpretation.)
<br>
<p>I don't hold any of these philosophies; I consider them useless, nonsense, and
<br>
useless nonsense, respectively.  But they are all philosophies, that can be
<br>
held by the human mind, but not (I think) represented accurately by HOPC.  The
<br>
important thing is that to know them involves changes in parts of the mind
<br>
other than the part that maps neatly into HOPC. They can't be learned by
<br>
internalizing lists of claims, which is what HOPC can represent.  It might be
<br>
that they cannot be represented by any mind not fairly similar to human,
<br>
including its physiological underpinnings.
<br>
<p>Of course, there is some wiggle room in the word &quot;represent&quot;.  For example, a
<br>
sufficiently powerful mind could simulate (&quot;imagine&quot;) a human being who held
<br>
such a philosophy, and when called upon to act according to the philosophy,
<br>
run the simulated entity through a situation, and act the same way.  But
<br>
that's representation without understanding.
<br>
<p>I think restricting your AI to representing things in HOPC is asking for the
<br>
kind of cognitive closure Mr. Porter is worried about.
<br>
<p>--Carl Feynman
<br>
<p>PS. JOIN message coming soon!
<br>
<p>PPS. This just occured to me: &quot;the part of the mind that maps neatly into
<br>
HOPC&quot; may be equivalent to &quot;the part of the mind open to conscious belief
<br>
revision&quot;.  Many philosophies involve changes by means other than conscious
<br>
belief revision.
