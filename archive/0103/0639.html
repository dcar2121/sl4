<p>
I think it is premature to say anything much at all about what an SI
<br>
might do or be used for.
<br>
<p>But there are clearly military applications for some fairly smart killing
<br>
appliances.
<br>
<p>Normal soldiers sent into battle are operating outside the environment for
<br>
which evolution designed the human body and brain.  There are loud scary
<br>
noises, and a need to react really quickly.  Humans make mistake.  They
<br>
kill innocent bystanders.  They misidentify targets.  They freak out and run
<br>
away, or act indecisively.
<br>
<p>There is little question that a smart killing machine could easily defeat
<br>
normal human soldiers.  Intelligence is needed to move about in an unfamiliar
<br>
environment, and for identification of armed targets (versus innocent bystanders).
<br>
Prioritization of targets involves rapidly judging the intentions (and predicting
<br>
the actions) of various people and things in the combat arena.
<br>
<p>Military hardware demands have been driven, in the wealthy West anyway, by increasing
<br>
needs for accuracy (think: laser guided bombs) and safety (for the soldiers controlling
<br>
them).  In very few cases, other than outright genocide, is it desirable for military
<br>
combatants to mow down or arbitrarily blow up civilians.  The United States, in our
<br>
war with Iraq, felt that it was somewhat important to pinpoint bombs on strictly
<br>
military targets as much as possible... but this was not always possible.
<br>
<p>Smart military machines could enter a dangerous urban environment and systematically
<br>
and quickly take out armed targets with (relatively) minimal damage to civilians.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing, mind you, I'm just
<br>
pointing out that powerful AI has military applications even at the
<br>
&quot;down and dirty&quot; level of war.  This leads me to think that the
<br>
military will be right there at the forefront of technology when an SI
<br>
becomes possible.
<br>
<p>I should introduce myself.  I'm Jimmy Wales, CEO of Bomis.com, but probably more
<br>
known to the geek community for Nupedia.com, the free encyclopedia.  You can
<br>
read an interview with me at Slashdot today.
