<p>No, a prime directive or laws of robotics clearly not. You should check 
<br>
out the discussion about this that has been raging on at 
<br>
<a href="mailto:Fountain_Society@yahoogroups.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20problem%20of%20cognitive%20closure">Fountain_Society@yahoogroups.com</a> for a while now. Some concensus was 
<br>
reached. Obviously you cannot &quot;control&quot; a superhuman intelligence if you 
<br>
actually wish to put it to use (i.e. set it free to some measure - which 
<br>
automatically leads to its complete freedom). You can try to understand 
<br>
its fundamental requirements (at least in each of its generations), and 
<br>
use that to trade/negotiate/interact with it.
<br>
Most optimally, you can join its ranks, which is most likely achievable 
<br>
through a mind upload into a whole brain emulated state.
<br>
<p>While I make no such claim myself, I should point out that if you 
<br>
actually believe that a superhuman intelligence will be benevolent 
<br>
(judging from the human example), then you should also be comfortable 
<br>
assuming the same about uploads. Thus there should be no catastrophy to 
<br>
fear from allowing all humans to elevate themselves through uploading.
<br>
<p>If you then decide to say &quot;on second though, perhaps superhuman 
<br>
intelligence is not necessarily benevolent&quot;, then it follows that this is 
<br>
also true for non-uploaded A.I. Then the question becomes, how far can 
<br>
you trust A.I. that is potentially non-benevolent to keep the best 
<br>
interests of humanity at heart? Not very far. Conclusion, once again at 
<br>
least try to keep up with it, at the head of developments, by uploading.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
