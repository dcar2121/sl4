<p>Okay, first to clarify my current position, because it has changed, 
<br>
or at least I think that it has.  First off, my problem with relying 
<br>
on FSIs for defense is that they will not be willing to sacrifice 
<br>
some in order to save others.  My guess is that an FSI is going to 
<br>
try to save everyone and end up not saving anyone.  That, or the FSI 
<br>
will hold back vis power for fear that ve might hurt others, rather 
<br>
than the UFSI.
<br>
<p>As for the cooperating team deal, I'm not sure how that applies here. 
<br>
I would not advocate having a team over a single SI for defense.  In 
<br>
fact, the single SI would probably be more efficient.  I've been 
<br>
thinking about this, and from what I can tell, post Singularity, this 
<br>
will be the best method of defense.  At first I supposed that it 
<br>
would be like with humans, where distributed forces are much harder 
<br>
to take over than concentrated forces, but I have since come to 
<br>
understand that, with SIs, distribution is not as important as 
<br>
capability.  20 weak SIs will loose to 1 SI, even if both sides have 
<br>
the same number of cycles, since the strong SI can execute attacks 
<br>
that 20 weak SIs, even working together, could never pull off or 
<br>
could only do much more slowly than the strong SI, who would have 
<br>
destroyed the weak SIs before they could complete their attack (due 
<br>
to latency and such).
<br>
<p>So, post Singularity, we may all pay SI Joe to defend are part of the 
<br>
universe and as long as ve does a good job, ve can keep vis job.  If 
<br>
ve's not working out, maybe I'll start paying SI Jane for defense. 
<br>
At any rate, I can see that SIs will be dealing with enough fire 
<br>
power that it will beyond the capabilities of an SI even distracted 
<br>
slightly from a devotion to defense to protect verself and others.
