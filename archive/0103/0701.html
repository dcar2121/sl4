There seems to be an implicit duality in the current conversation between
<br>
physical and uploaded existence, and I'm doubting it would really be an
<br>
issue to SI thinking.  You don't need to upload someone to sysop for them,
<br>
mere god like awareness and perfect knowledge of atomic physics is more than
<br>
enough to install API protocols within base physical reality.  Consider how
<br>
slowly it runs - a blissfully relaxing job compared to the maintenance of
<br>
the billion universes buzzing along in the computronium.  Besides, there's
<br>
probably a really elegant way in which computronium can transparently
<br>
coexist in the same spacetime as Amish material subtrate, with neither side
<br>
being any inconvenience to the other for tens of thousands of perceived
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>A related observation - a Sysop need not limit the freedom of anyone living
<br>
within ver sphere of influence, it is enough to increase everyone's freedom
<br>
by giving them the power of a sophisticated descendent of the killfile or
<br>
/ignore command.  You can do whatever the hell you like, you may have
<br>
complete privacy in all things, (With the one fundamental exception of
<br>
creating new life) provided that everyone else is at liberty to filter their
<br>
own perception of you and your actions on a whim.  What sort of societies
<br>
will develop in that world?
