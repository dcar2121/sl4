<p>Ok, at least you admit that you did noticed them and you had to think about 
<br>
them at some point.  That was what I had real difficulty accepting, that 
<br>
you never even noticed their use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, when I've explained the v pronouns to people, many have liked the

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hmm, see here I personally have no difficulty.  She doesn't make me think 
<br>
gender any more than he does.  Every time you read material written about 
<br>
'generic' individuals they use either he, or she or a combination of them 
<br>
(such as in an &quot;Employee Handbook&quot;).  But I have no problem understanding 
<br>
that the material relates equally to both women and men, and that gender is 
<br>
irrelevant in the context.
<br>
<p>If the English language had gender neutral pronouns, or there was a widely 
<br>
used and well known set of them (from the &quot;public&quot; standpoint, not SF) then 
<br>
that would be great.  But there isn't and I would like to see all this 
<br>
material be as comprehensible as possible to the broadest range of 
<br>
individuals possible.
<br>
<p>FYI - I like the idea of gender neutral pronouns if you don't know 
<br>
someone's gender (as per your example).  But I think I'd rather just ask 
<br>
and get it straightened out than draw attention to the fact.  And, thinking 
<br>
about it, using neutered gender pronouns may cause an equal emotional 
<br>
reaction than using the wrong gender pronouns.  I hope a 'Language Cortex' 
<br>
is being planned, so our creations (and, eventually, ourselves) won't have 
<br>
this problem down the road...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Maybe we should compare demographics.  The people I associate with are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generally other students near my age, teachers, and the people I program 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with on projects over the Internet.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I mostly associate with friends and colleges at work.  My friends 
<br>
tend to be very intelligent and open minded.  The people I work with cover 
<br>
a fairly broad range.  Unfortunately, far too many of them are seem less 
<br>
intelligent than I would have expected, and they don't really qualify as 
<br>
open-minded, in my opinion at least.
<br>
<p>Actually, this is a great example.  I work for a very well known, and very 
<br>
large corporation doing software architecture.  I work with high-level 
<br>
engineers and architects on a daily bases.  One day the question came up of 
<br>
how to individually address 2 hosts that have the same IP address, but are 
<br>
connected to different NICs.  Now to me, this is obvious, you can't.  It 
<br>
took over 20 minutes to explain this to the lot of them, and some were 
<br>
still not convinced.  These guys are very high level engineers/architects 
<br>
and all of them work with networking on a daily basis; they should have 
<br>
known this.
<br>
<p>The great lengths I have to go to, on a regular basis, to get these guys to 
<br>
understand what I consider to be very simple concepts astounds me.  When I 
<br>
consider how much effort this takes, talking to senior engineers in the 
<br>
area they work in, I truly comprehend how difficult it is to convey 
<br>
advanced concept to the general public.

<em>&gt;Hello all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As a student and a newcomer to the Singularity and the exploration of sl4
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues in general, I find using gender-nuetral pronouns quite helpful. When I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disseminate material, I write my interpretation of the material down, so I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read it later, and share with those around me my interpretation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When I first read through CatAI, it was the first of anything like close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sl4 that I had ever read. It was comforting to me to know that people had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought out in such detail that even the pronouns had changed, and I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impressed by the professional feel the gender-nuetral pronouns gave me.
</em><br>
<p>I can see and understand this point of view.  But, what really worries me 
<br>
are the teeming masses of people out there who are not so open minded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The use of gender-nuetral pronouns provides a useful distancing of concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that would otherwise seem way too threatening to accept for some people. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is helpful, because in these people can in their scorn mull over sl4-ish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues without losing face. It is my hope that the use of gender-nuetral
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pronouns continues and spreads, because it reflects the differences between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AIs and humans.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but we don't want distancing.  We want these concepts to seem &quot;friendly&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Refering to AIs as a him or a her is prejudiced. When dealing with a foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture, you do not treat them as your own culture, you must take into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;account
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thier differences and celebrate them. Being Alaska Native, I have seen this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first hand, where people in attempt to create equality between the races,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;treat Alaska Natives as white people. This is a prejudiced reaction, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alaska
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Natives are not white. As if white people were the only measuring stick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Therefore treating AIs like humans is prejudiced against the AIs.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  First, for the case of pure AIs, then you may be somewhat 
<br>
correct.  But when we start talking about SIs, then this is not as 
<br>
clear.  If *I* upload, *I* may still consider myself male.  My wife may 
<br>
still consider herself female.  Maybe we won't, maybe we will, but there is 
<br>
no way to tell until it happens.  So I don't think any writing that occur 
<br>
before the fact can be considered prejudiced.
<br>
<p>If we get an AI up to speed and it asks us to stop referring to it as a she 
<br>
(or he), then we should worry about this.  But I find it hard to believe 
<br>
that an AI will take offense to us referring to it as a she.  People have 
<br>
feelings, egos, strong self image, prejudices, etc.  I am not so certain 
<br>
that AI will have all of these, and if we want &quot;friendly&quot; AI, I assume that 
<br>
it would not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Using gender-nuetral pronouns furthur brings to mind the differences between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AIs and humans, and therefore helps to avoid applying anthropomorphic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them. Perhaps someone could sing a song of our differences and we could take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pride in our effort to accept one another. We do this in INupiaq Eskimo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;culture and it helps. In the exploration of differences, we see how alike we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really are to each other. I am very interested in seeing this concept brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up, as it is one step of many to bringing AIs and humans not furthur apart,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but closer together in our understanding.
</em><br>
<p>Well, in the grand scheme of things Eskimos and all other humans are 
<br>
amazingly alike.  An Eskimo male probably does many things that an Asian 
<br>
male does.  They also have similar thought processes, emotions, etc.  Same 
<br>
goes for a Jamacan woman and an white American woman.  People, on the 
<br>
whole, are very similar.  We *create* artificial differences between each 
<br>
other in our minds, more than anything else.
<br>
<p>On the other hand SIs are very, very much different.  They do not have the 
<br>
same thought processes, general intelligence capacity and probably even 
<br>
have different emotions.  They won't need to sleep, eat, have sex, go to 
<br>
the bathroom, etc.  If they do any of this, it won't be anything like what 
<br>
we do.  For example, they may consume power in some form, but it won't 
<br>
resemble eating food in virtually any way.
<br>
<p>So, IMHO, we don't need to &quot;further bring to mind the differences between
<br>
AIs and humans&quot; like you suggest.  We need to do the exact opposite, and 
<br>
make the idea of SIs more comfortable to the general population.
<br>
<p>After all, if estimates (and my memory) hold true, we will see SIs within 
<br>
7-25 years.  That is much less time than it took people to truly accept and 
<br>
be completely comfortable with just about any other significant technology 
<br>
advancement in history.
