<p>
When I first started subscribing to this mailing list, I thought that the 
<br>
goal of SingInst was to build a transhuman AI. I was wrong. The goal is 
<br>
obviously to build a Utopia where Evil as defined by the members of the list 
<br>
will be banished. The AI would be a means to that end, a Santa-machine who 
<br>
uses his intelligence to serve mankind.
<br>
<p>With this in mind, it is clear that you have to discuss the E-word and 
<br>
define it somehow.
<br>
<p>Personally, I feel that it will probably be impossible to &quot;hardwire&quot; 
<br>
anthropomorphic morality and reasoning into a seed AI and expect those 
<br>
goal-systems to remain after severe self-enhancement by the transcending AI. 
<br>
Just as some humans are beginning to discard the hardwired goal of 
<br>
procreation (our very reason for existing in the first place), the AI would  
<br>
probably develop other goals (perhaps unknowable to us) that will eclipse 
<br>
the original goals of servitude.
<br>
<p>The resulting SI would be an utterly alien thing, and any speculation about 
<br>
its actions would be futile. Hence my slight irritation regarding 
<br>
discussions about the Sysops do:s and don't:s.
<br>
<p>I have only skimmed &quot;Friendly AI&quot;, so I do not consider the above to be a 
<br>
critique of the feasibility of the Sysop-scenario (I will likely make one 
<br>
later). However, the musings above will probably shed light on most of the 
<br>
questions that have been raised in response to my original posts.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I fail to see the need for discussing concepts like good, evil, morality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethics at all, or how a Power/SI would relate to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This seems like a very limited and inhuman[e] view.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the SI is non-human after all (see above), and it is the actions of 
<br>
the SI that will matter post-singularity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethics then there are no guiding principles to your actions, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abstraction of what is truly in your self-interest longterm or not
</em><br>
<p>Since it is my belief that the post-singularity world will be unknowable, my 
<br>
definition of long-term is on the order of 20-25 years. My guiding 
<br>
principles is reaching singularity as fast as possible. If you want to call 
<br>
that ethics, that's fine with me.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every decision governing whether to take an action is utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seat-of-the-pants at that moment.  You also cannot depend on any context
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the actions of others as they will make their own seat-of-the-pants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(pls excuse physical metaphors) decisions moment by moment.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. Humans act in their own self-interest. They have done so in the 
<br>
past, and they will probably continue to do so in the future. However, most 
<br>
of the time it is in their own self-interest to be nice to members of their 
<br>
&quot;pack&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be no level of trust.
</em><br>
<p>If you organize yourself in a &quot;pack&quot; and follow the rules set up there, you 
<br>
can get personal protection and greater means of achieving your goals (they 
<br>
normally coincide with those of the pack). When you interact with another 
<br>
pack-member, you can be pretty sure that he/she will not break the rules and 
<br>
risk exclusion from the pack. This can be called trust. The rules that the 
<br>
pack sets up can be called ethics.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Ethics seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little more than rules set up by humans in order to maintain a fairly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society. I don't see how that can have any meaning in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world or even in the last years leading up to the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What, the need goes away for stable associations of entities?  How &gt;so?
</em><br>
<p>There will ONE relevant entity. This entity will IMO relate to humans as we 
<br>
relate to bacteria. We do not make stable associations with bacteria.
<br>
<p>Again, the unknowability assumption makes it impossible to predict anything 
<br>
IMO.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The need for stable associations and for governing primary ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principle if anything increases as the entities get more powerful and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capable of greater harm and as the interactions and activities get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orders of magnitude more complex.
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><p>/Christian
