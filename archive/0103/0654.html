</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>So you're saying that (A) memory size/speed is more of a bottleneck to 
<br>
AI than processor time, and (B) it's not worth doing anything about 
<br>
because in a few years time we'll have that anyway?
<br>
<p>Well, you could decide to just go on holiday and just wait for things 
<br>
to eventually happen all by themselves! I would prefer to do something 
<br>
about it now and get next years performance today if it's at all 
<br>
possible. Waiting is a good strategy for catching a bus, not advancing 
<br>
the Singularity.
<br>
<p>The time involved writing a compressor is nowhere near comparible to 
<br>
waiting for hardware to improve. The first sounds like a weekends work, 
<br>
the second is a multi-year wait. (BTW there's a zip library already 
<br>
available in Java.)
<br>
<p>Compressing the data *could* potentially give you worthwhile gains if 
<br>
your app is heavy on disk access. Let's say your processor has to load 
<br>
a large block of data (4 second), then process it (1 second), then save 
<br>
it (4 second). Total time is 9 seconds.
<br>
Now if you could compress that data down to 1/4 of its original size, 
<br>
the total time taken would be 1+1+1 = 3 seconds. That's 3 times faster. 
<br>
(You're also 4 times more likely to find the data you want in the disk 
<br>
cache, depending on access patterns.) Admittedly, if the access 
<br>
patterns are nothing like that then you may not get much gain, but it's 
<br>
certainly worth trying if they are.
<br>
<p>I've used Java for memory demanding apps in the past and found it to be 
<br>
a terrible memory hog, mainly because of it's poor garbage collection. 
<br>
I found it didn't scale very well at all. It seems like an odd choice, 
<br>
that's why I was asking.
<br>
<p>BTW don't forget, this is in the context of AI - linear improvements 
<br>
can lead to exponential returns. They don't call it a Singularity for 
<br>
nothing! :)
<br>
<p>Singularity Now!
