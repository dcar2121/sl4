<p>
I do not make a Bayesian argument.  Nor do I consider apocalyptic
<br>
elements to always be proof of religious memes.  Was the cold war and
<br>
the threat of nuclear destruction of the species an example of
<br>
supposedly religious memes?  No.  
<br>
<p>The connections I do draw are due to elements of commonality that are
<br>
deeper, like the drive toward transcendence of the &quot;normal&quot; human
<br>
condition that is common to both religions and much of science, or the
<br>
fact that we are headed for (ourselves and or our creations) the
<br>
possession of &quot;god-like&quot; powers that require (if we wish to avoid
<br>
disaster) some large gains in ethics and perhaps compassion for fellow
<br>
sentients.  This has a relationship to &quot;Friendliness&quot;.  
<br>
<p>That Singularity is based in fact by no means releases it from having
<br>
anyting at all in common with that which drives religions.   Picking out
<br>
some stupidities from various religions as supposed contrasts does not
<br>
change this.  I would also point out that many of the world's religions
<br>
are not apocalyptic in the least and don't have any of the
<br>
fundamentalist Christian notions often trotted out to show how worthless
<br>
all things spiritual/religous are. 
<br>
<p>Religious people talk about God, Singularity folks talk about the Sysop
<br>
or Jupiter Brains or ...  
<br>
<p>We might well be headed for a time when religious memes and even some
<br>
religious ideals are supported quite strongly or even necessitated by
<br>
the facts of our science and technology and what it enables.  I think it
<br>
behooves us to not rigidly assume that science is over here and has all
<br>
the answers and religion is over there and totally full of bullshit
<br>
through and through with no redeeming qualities.  
<br>
<p>And that is all I have to say for now in this forum on that subject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There was a time when you could safely dismiss every theory or prediction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that invoked nonhuman actors.  That time is over.  You must now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish religious from nonreligious memes by checking for actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference to supernatural causes, or actual distortions of logic, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than simply reasoning from surface similarities.
</em><br>
<p><p>Here I very much agree.
<br>
