<p><em>&gt; &gt; Is the

<p>No.  Do you have any other questions?
<br>
<p>I realize that this is an &quot;interesting tangent&quot;, and that you haven't
<br>
lived through the endless dreary discussions on the Extropians list as I
<br>
have, and that there are probably some people on the list who haven't yet
<br>
been transhumanists long enough to be as heartily sick of this topic as I
<br>
am, so I'm not following my natural inclinations, which are to censor this
<br>
outright.  You don't know, they don't know, I shouldn't snap at anyone;
<br>
fine, I accept that.  It's even possible that there are a few people on
<br>
the list who, not knowing better, would take a KillThread as a confession
<br>
of Sacred Cowdom.
<br>
<p>When I was five or so, I read a people-fake-up-a-ghost story in which the
<br>
wise protagonist explains at one point:  &quot;There are two ways to believe in
<br>
ghosts.  One way is full belief; believing that ghosts and goblins really
<br>
exist.  The other way is half-belief; saying you don't believe, that it's
<br>
a superstition, but still starting at noises in the night, and making up
<br>
strange explanations whenever you see something unusual.  And in many
<br>
ways, half-believing is worse.&quot;
<br>
<p>Stories are just stories.  They don't matter one way or the other.  The
<br>
fact that a story exists and is patently false does not provide data about
<br>
the truth of unrelated projections.  &quot;The world's biggest fool may say the
<br>
sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark out.&quot;  (Robert Persig, _Zen
<br>
and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_.)
