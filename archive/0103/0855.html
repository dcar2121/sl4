<p>True, but I just wanted to point out that the general public already has 
<br>
some exposure to non-gendered use of gender specific pronouns.  And I've 
<br>
never heard anyone complain about it...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; May very well be true, but 've' still sounds goofy.  I hear more stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comments about those pronouns than anything else in the papers when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggest others read them.  That indicates to me that they are a problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Interesting.  I suspect that this is a general resistance to the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ungendered people, more than a particular hatred for the letter V.  Perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a perceived overlap with political correctness is part of the problem.  I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not certain, but one individual in particular is very open minded and yet 
<br>
still wanted to know what was up with all the weird v references.  I just 
<br>
think it distracts from the really important concepts we are trying to 
<br>
inform people about.  If they remember any one thing from reading this 
<br>
stuff (and, unfortunately, many people don't retain much more on original 
<br>
exposure) we don't want it to be the pronouns!  Do we?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;When I was walking home from school a large, black, dog appeared ahead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me.  It came running at me while growling, which made me very scared.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ran the other way as fast as possible and jumped a fence before it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; catch me.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That is a dog taking the role of primal fear monster, of course 'it' works
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for that.  Likewise insane hollywood AI (Shodan) and even enemy people when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suitably demonised.  That doesn't make 'it' suitable for dogs generally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Okay, here's a more human centric rule of thumb: 'It' means something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't have a -name-.  The seed AI will likely go through a ton of names.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(And nicknames)
</em><br>
<p>Well, admittedly it was a bit stretched.  It was an attempt to dispel two 
<br>
points with one paragraph and may have failed.  However, 'it' is suitable 
<br>
for animals in general, *if* you don't know their gender or it doesn't 
<br>
matter in context.  But I can see where 'it' doesn't work very well when 
<br>
describing AIs.  But I am warming up to the idea of using she for the Sysop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Ah, but the question is, how many more would not dismiss it as loony if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; used standard pronouns?  Using us as a sample is biased.  This information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will eventually apply to, and need to be read by, the general public.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because we can look at the facts and say &quot;this makes sense&quot;, doesn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any relevance on if the general public could do the same.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No argument there, but eventually is the key word.  Introductions will be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as you say, available in levels and stages, with appropriately targeted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas and language, not merely as a raw text dump of the entire SL4 archive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Meanwhile, I'm still assuming that anyone reading this right now has already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progressed through SL1-3 in their own time.
</em><br>
<p>All bets are off there.  It isn't like this information is hidden somewhere 
<br>
where 'lay' people can't read it.  Heck, I stumbled across &quot;Staring Into 
<br>
The Singularity&quot; by complete accident.  I wasn't even looking for anything 
<br>
like this but it came up on an unrelated search.  It looked interesting so 
<br>
I left it open in a browser window for like a week before I read any of it, 
<br>
and then holy s***.  After reading the first page or so (at home), I spent 
<br>
the rest of my day (at work) reading nothing but Singularity related 
<br>
info.  So I'm not so certain about people not getting it as a raw text 
<br>
dump.  Luckily I was already very comfortable with SL3 when I happened upon 
<br>
it or my head may have imploded.
