Using 've' &amp; 'ver' is confusing. I mentally substitute a 'him' or 'her' on the fly as I'm reading. If you're worried about clarity, you should avoid adding extra hoops for the reader to jump though, the subject matter is tricky enough.
<br>
<p>You also loose a little credibility for using it. It stands out more than anything else. Another reason to avoid it.
<br>
<p>This following flows quite nicely. I have no problem with the idea that Jimmy is an AI:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Jimmy started it when he said that gender-neutral writing shouldn't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult or confusing, and that, though it might represent a problem for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inexperienced writers, he was pretty sure that it wasn't that hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;handle.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I've always thought it rather silly to refer to a ship as a 'she' because it's not alive. However referring to an AI as a 'she' sounds quite reasonable. Okay, so there's the small technicality of it having no gender, but people naturally tend to anthropomorphize anyway - it maps rather well onto how people think.
<br>
<p>As well and the obvious sex attributes 'he' or 'she' gives to an object, by far the most important attribute is that of a living mind. A 'he' implies a person more than a male with male reproductive organs. An 'it' implies an inanimate object.
<br>
<p>I vote the SysOp be a she, you then have a spare gender to use for talking about SysOp - citizen interactions.
<br>
<p>*On published documents you can place a little footnote somewhere explaining why she is a 'she' and not an 'it' and blah blah blah, why we don't usually like to anthropomorphize, etc. etc.  Easy.
<br>
<p>Please reconsider it. (No pun intended.)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Dale Johnstone.
<br>
<p>(BTW For those wondering, Dale is a 'he', well... most of the time anyway. On Sundays he transforms into a Dalek to spice up the local church service. &quot;REPENT OR BE EXTERMINATED!&quot;. (Sorry, it's been a long day.))
