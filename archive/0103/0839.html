<p>True, the Vs often give me pause as I do the same.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I very much agree with this.  He/she is much easier for the reader, and 
<br>
people are already accustomed to reading about non-gendered entities using 
<br>
them.  God is usually referred to as a &quot;he&quot;, but many (most?) people 
<br>
believe God is non-gendered.  Or at the very least could take on any gender 
<br>
he so choose at any time.  If talking about non-gendered, all knowing 
<br>
entities for thousands of years has not spawned the creation of gender 
<br>
neutral pronouns, I think it is a lost cause.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;*On published documents you can place a little footnote somewhere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explaining why she is a 'she' and not an 'it' and blah blah blah, why we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't usually like to anthropomorphize, etc. etc.  Easy.
</em><br>
<p>I also agree here.  The nice thing here is that reading this is not 
<br>
required to understand the concept.  Most people will understand that an AI 
<br>
does not have gender anyway.  But using ve requires the reader to stop and 
<br>
figure out what the hell that means.
<br>
<p>Besides, a human that uploads may still some gender identity.  I may till 
<br>
consider myself a &quot;he&quot; on the other side, even though I could physically 
<br>
change this at will.

</em><br>
<p>May very well be true, but 've' still sounds goofy.  I hear more stupid 
<br>
comments about those pronouns than anything else in the papers when I 
<br>
suggest others read them.  That indicates to me that they are a problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;'It' isn't just grammatically restrictive, it's the wrong word.  'It' means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something non-mind.  A brick.  A photon.  A tree.  Anything far enough down

<em>&gt;the complexity scale that the idea of 'murder' does not apply.  I would be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&quot;When I was walking home from school a large, black, dog appeared ahead of 
<br>
me.  It came running at me while growling, which made me very scared.  I 
<br>
ran the other way as fast as possible and jumped a fence before it could 
<br>
catch me.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dogs are not gender neutral, but that works just fine.  And, last I 
<br>
checked, dogs had minds.  If someone went up to your puppy and blew it away 
<br>
with a shotgun, the newspaper headlines would read &quot;Puppy murdered in cold 
<br>
blood&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Surely all newcomers to SL4 are at least occasional SF readers who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;managed to look at some of the CaTAI and Singularity papers without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dismissing Eliezer as a loony.  To me, that suggests the ability to cope
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the occasional use of words like 'verself'.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but the question is, how many more would not dismiss it as loony if it 
<br>
used standard pronouns?  Using us as a sample is biased.  This information 
<br>
will eventually apply to, and need to be read by, the general public.  Just 
<br>
because we can look at the facts and say &quot;this makes sense&quot;, doesn't have 
<br>
any relevance on if the general public could do the same.
<br>
<p>If you want to change someone's mind you don't hit them with a ton of 
<br>
information and new concepts and expect them to change.  You introduce 
<br>
concepts one step at a time until the individual understands.  These posts, 
<br>
and the related papers, contain many radical new ideas that take some 
<br>
getting used to.  Isn't that the whole point behind shock levels 
<br>
anyway?  Further burdening the reader by screwing around with the English 
<br>
language does not help, it detracts from the subject matter.  So, I guess 
<br>
the question is, would you rather introduce gender neutral pronouns or talk 
<br>
about the Singularity with people?  Because if you try to do both you may 
<br>
loose them.
