<p>The problem with the Borg is that its a trap, a one way
<br>
trip, a roach motel.  What if we could voluntarily join
<br>
a Borg, play in that until we were satisfied, then get back
<br>
out to our individual existence at will?  Wouldnt that be
<br>
way cool?
<br>
<p>What if we had a job where we could learn some
<br>
super specialized task, every nuance and detail.  Then
<br>
we go to work every day, at a workstation in our home
<br>
for instance, by putting on a helmet that lets one communicate
<br>
with any other Borg member, see what they see, hear
<br>
what they hear and vice versa.
<br>
<p>For instance, I have an obscure make of motorcycle with
<br>
a known design flaw in the secondary gear case which
<br>
could make the back wheel lock, which can spoil your
<br>
day if it happens at highway speed.  I recently rebuilt
<br>
mine, so now I know the exact order each bolt hasta
<br>
come off and how to do every little thing.  If we could
<br>
form a Borg, I could effectively transmit my experience-
<br>
gained knowledge to other owners of this bike, so
<br>
they could rebuild their secondary gear boxes.  No
<br>
one need leave their home.  {Which I suppose would
<br>
obviate the bike, but this is just an example.}
<br>
<p>How many of you have voluntarily lost your individuality
<br>
in a crowd, specifically something like a marching band?
<br>
There is a feeling that is sooooo wicked cool, from being
<br>
a part of a bigger unit that is getting it done, that is wailing,
<br>
that is greater than the self.  We should have something like
<br>
a Borg that you check into when you want and check
<br>
back out of when you want.  The only reason the Star
<br>
Trek Borg gets such bad press is that it isnt voluntary
<br>
or easily reversible.  spike
