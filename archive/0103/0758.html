<em>&gt;Well I think in the after-Singularity era you have to turn such questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around.. you have to ask, if we can do something like end all evil, why not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do it? The only reason I see not to do it is if a) the entities (SIs) capable

</em><br>
<p>Or the big one that everyone seems to keep missing.  If the only way to 
<br>
accomplish it is to severely impinge freedom it should not be done.  I 
<br>
imagine the desire to have free will won't change, even for SIs.  Heck, it 
<br>
may be much more the case; what's the point in being able to do anything if 
<br>
you're not allowed to do much at all.
<br>
<p>I also have a serious problem believing any intelligence can fully 
<br>
'control' another.  Espicially when you get into controlling SIs.  The only 
<br>
way to completely prevent loopholes and the like would, most likely, be a 
<br>
serious limitation on possible actions.  A Sysop type mechanism is only 
<br>
really necessary if SIs in general can't be trusted.  And, if that is the 
<br>
case, and SIs can't be trusted, why bother with the Sysop idea at 
<br>
all.  Now, I can understand the idea of a Sysop protecting Humans and the 
<br>
like from SIs, if needed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I actually doubt many would want to play outside in the gloomi-verse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway. I mean shifting great lumps of matter around with all sorts of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid laws you can't change just won't compare to a place where almost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything is possible. It would be a lack of imagination on their part - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can do whatever they wanted to do on the outside, on the inside, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *far* more.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I doubt many would want to play in a VR.  What's the point, 
<br>
having infinite control of nothing would get boring very quickly, I 
<br>
imagine.  I can see where a self-indulgent human may think that life in a 
<br>
VR that is totally under their control would be great.  Heck, I can imagine 
<br>
years worth of things that would be, shall we say, very entertaining.  But 
<br>
I have a feeling that such self-indulgence won't be as interesting to SIs, 
<br>
who could essentially simulate anything they want internally at any time 
<br>
anyway.  The real universe, full of real matter and real problems, would 
<br>
provide the only remaining challenges and opportunities to continue learning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps, but I still want my personal starship.. at least for a while :-)
</em><br>
<p>Just one?  Personally, I'd like to clone myself a couple of times and head 
<br>
out in several directions at once.  :&gt;
