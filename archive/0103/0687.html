<p>
For me, it boils down to (a) Turing computability and (b) the
<br>
observability of noncomputability.  I myself don't believe in HOPC, so I'm
<br>
substituting computability for that; any system or behavior that can be
<br>
understood by reference to computable rules.  If our world is
<br>
noncomputable, I would expect that noncomputability to be, at the least,
<br>
observable.
<br>
<p>The obvious disaster scenario is that a mind &quot;programmed&quot; to believe in
<br>
computability uploads humans who turn out to be non-uploadable.  Given
<br>
that Godel's Theorem and Turing's exposition of the halting problem are
<br>
quite explicable to computable minds, I'd expect any mature AI to be able
<br>
to formulate the concepts &quot;computable&quot; and &quot;noncomputable&quot;, and to
<br>
understand the importance of finally verifying the computability of the
<br>
human mind before uploading it into computable substrate.  In fact, I'd
<br>
expect final verification to turn up in any case, as single neurons and
<br>
groups of neurons are completely simulated - or unsuccessfully simulated -
<br>
as a test case before going on to the larger mind.
<br>
<p>I don't expect noncomputability to be subtle.  In particular, any form of
<br>
internal mental life that I have - whether I'm monads or quarks or
<br>
something else entirely - which can affect these sentences I now type, is
<br>
either computable or not explicable by reference to computable forces.  If
<br>
it's possible to explain away all my philosophizing by reference to
<br>
computable forces - or rather, if I'm opened up and nondestructively
<br>
scanned and all my philosophizing is the product of clearly *visible* and
<br>
computable forces - then I, me, the person now doing this philosophizing,
<br>
has been captured in toto.  Insofar as monads exert observable forces on
<br>
these my sentences, their internal processes have visible effects, and the
<br>
monads can be categorized as effable or ineffable accordingly.  If the
<br>
monads are monolithic objects whose internal states have no visible
<br>
effects on the flow of causality, then it is not possible that they
<br>
account for my qualia or my beliefs about qualia or these my typed
<br>
sentences about qualia.
<br>
<p>What I want is some kind of Bayesian-useful account of how a monad-dualist
<br>
Chalmersian universe differs from this our Universe, or how a totally
<br>
computable universe would differ from this our monad-dualist universe.  As
<br>
far as I'm concerned, the signature effect of qualia is a civilization in
<br>
which - not contrivedly, but naturally and emergently - philosophers arise
<br>
who start talking about qualia.  If this quality is present in both
<br>
universes, then all the parts of myself that I value have been accounted
<br>
for.  If coming up with a computable account of this Universe requires
<br>
deliberate tampering or very wide searches to find equivalent speculations
<br>
about qualia, then this Universe is most likely noncomputable.  More
<br>
likely still is that simulating a single neuron would turn out to be
<br>
impossible.
