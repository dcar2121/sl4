<em>&gt; So a priority for me is to see what concepts like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed AI, self-enhancement, and Friendly AI would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look like given the philosophy of mind sketched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the last paragraph.  [a quantum-computing-based philosophy of mind]
</em><br>
<p>I certainly wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from thinking about
<br>
something as fascinating as this -- not in a world where most people
<br>
spend their time watching sit-coms and reading People Magazine...
<br>
<p>But still, from my point of view, there's something a bit funny in
<br>
worrying about the implications for &quot;real AI&quot; of something as poorly
<br>
understood
<br>
as quantum computing.  I guess my problem is this: real AI is badly
<br>
understood
<br>
and quantum computing is badly understood... so by putting them together
<br>
what
<br>
are you going to get?  Either the two will resolve each others'
<br>
uncertainties
<br>
(not likely in my view) or you'll just get a doubly fuzzy mess (likely in
<br>
my view)
<br>
<p>Personally I'm more inclined to work out real AI in as much detail as
<br>
possible
<br>
(not just theorizing but trying to build the damn thing), and to try to
<br>
understand
<br>
what the fuck is going on with quantum computing (which Mitchell is doing
<br>
quite nicely
<br>
in his own research work, although this work is clearly at a very early
<br>
stage).
<br>
<p>Having said all that, I do have a somewhat more productive comment as well
<br>
;&gt;
<br>
<p>A lot of what's unique in the Webmind AI Engine is the fusion of techniques
<br>
we call &quot;reasonable&quot; and techniques we call &quot;intuitive&quot;
<br>
<p>Roughly speaking, reasonable techniques are incremental.  They combine two
<br>
pieces of
<br>
knowledge to form a third piece of knowledge.  Different ways of doing this
<br>
constitute
<br>
different reasoning rules (induction, abduction, deduction, implication,
<br>
unification, etc.).
<br>
<p>Intuitive techniques on the other hand are holistic.  A node in Webmind can
<br>
form a halo, meaning
<br>
that it uses NN-like activation spreading techniques to suss out what other
<br>
things in Webmind's mind
<br>
are &quot;in some way related to it&quot;, without necessarily figuring out what the
<br>
relationship is...
<br>
<p>In the system's dynamics, intuitive techniques guide reasonable techniques.
<br>
The system reasons in the
<br>
direction that its intuition has guided it.  Right now we have tested this
<br>
only in the context of first-order
<br>
inference, over the next 6 months the higher-order inference code we've
<br>
written will be integrated with intuitive
<br>
processes in this way.
<br>
<p>If I had to make a guess about where quantum computing would help a mind,
<br>
then, it would be this:
<br>
FASTER AND BETTER INTUITIVE PROCESSING.  If intuitive processsing involves
<br>
an element of the mind integrating
<br>
into itself a rough understanding of how it relates to the rest of the
<br>
mind -- this is the sort of thing quantum
<br>
nonlocality would presumably help out a lot with.
<br>
<p>Self-enhancement on the part of AI, in my view, will just be an advanced
<br>
reasoning process which conducted
<br>
a lot like other advanced reasoning processes.  The intuitive part of it
<br>
will come from introspection, which
<br>
may be enhanced by quantum nonlocality.  The reasonable part of it will be
<br>
good old higher-order logic, which
<br>
due to its discrete and precise nature is fairly unlikely to be hugely
<br>
assisted by quantum phenomena (at a guess).
<br>
<p>Finally I'll reiterate from previous messages my basic attitude towards
<br>
quantum computing and the mind.
<br>
My guess is that quantum computing is not necessary for consciousness and
<br>
real AI.  It surely would be a useful
<br>
tool for mind-building, but is probably not a necessary one.  Whether the
<br>
brain uses this particular tool or not is
<br>
unknown, and I don't have a strong intuition about it.
