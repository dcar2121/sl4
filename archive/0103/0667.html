<em>&gt; Why do you think that the basement-level Eliezer's actions carry a billion

</em><br>
<p>Because my - his - we need new pronouns - sensory information is
<br>
duplicated a billion times over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Indeed, in some respects Eliezer seems more like one of those slightly

</em><br>
<p>I'm fairly sure that years 14-17 were in *someone's* real life - I really
<br>
can't see someone putting that into an educational simulation except for
<br>
the sake of historical accuracy.  If this is a simulation, I don't expect
<br>
that I have much free will.
<br>
<p>I tend to deprecate the &quot;amoral posthumans simulating whole civilizations&quot;
<br>
hypothesis - (a) I don't think it's true, (b) our civilization currently
<br>
seems to be on track for either extermination or Friendliness (neither
<br>
future allows the amoral simulation of whole civilizations), and (c) if it
<br>
is true, there's not much I can do about it.
<br>
<p>The Sysop Citizenship Rules, I expect, disallow simulation of single
<br>
unconsenting individuals even as personally experienced virtual realities
<br>
- never mind the simulation and extermination of entire civilizations!  I
<br>
know (or rather, I recall) that during most of my life I would not have
<br>
consented to remaining unknowing in the simulation - I'm not sure I would
<br>
consent to it now - but it's possible that The Rules work differently than
<br>
I expect, and interim nonconsent turns out to be okay as long as there's a
<br>
near-certainty of approval in retrospect by a future self.  Since
<br>
my/his/Eliezer's life is certainly educational, it's possible to imagine
<br>
that I approved the reliving, or will come to approve this reliving with
<br>
near certainty.  Again, this is not how I expect that Friendliness works,
<br>
but I could be wrong.
<br>
<p>But, again, I think this *is* the real world.
