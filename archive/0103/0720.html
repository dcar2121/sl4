Time for me to delurk as well :) I'll get round to doing a join post soon.
<br>
<p>I know that us newbies may cover old ground and might not be a bit naive to 
<br>
contribute to some of the high level discussions but there needs to be a 
<br>
forum for people new to the singularity ideas to discuss matters. I 
<br>
understand that lurking on the mailing lists and reading recommended books 
<br>
and web articles helps but the best way to learn is by discussing and 
<br>
debating key ideas.
<br>
<p>Think about a university: it exists to support researchers to produce 
<br>
cutting edge research and also to teach students so that they may one day 
<br>
become the academics. I remember being a biochemistry fresher - most of the 
<br>
topics in the first term related to 1940's research (when biochemistry as 
<br>
an independent discipline was founded) then built on this and we got up to 
<br>
the current papers by the 2nd year. I know it must have been boring for the 
<br>
tutors but everyone has to start by covering old ground to prevent old 
<br>
mistakes being made again.
<br>
<p>How about a list for letting newcomers cut their teeth on before moving 
<br>
onto this one? We are dealing with some very advanced philosophy at times 
<br>
(respect to you all) and the only way to get to this level is with some 
<br>
practice using common points that are frequently made. If all curious 
<br>
newcomers are treated with a &quot;been there done that&quot; attitude by the more 
<br>
experienced members is the community ever to grow? Especially when there is 
<br>
already vocal objection to extropian ideas (thankfully shock level 4 is a 
<br>
level too high for them to be shocked by it yet).
<br>
<p>Apologies for the rant - I can't exactly ask the girl behind the checkout 
<br>
in the supermarket for her views on the SysOp and methods of neural 
<br>
uploading. Where else is there to go?
<br>
