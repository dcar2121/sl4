<em>&gt;(Of course, it's kind of ironic that this post comes in a thread entitled

<em>&gt;&quot;Sysop vs. Liberty&quot;.  It's just that certain other mailing lists I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a pattern wherein the same discussions are just repeated over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over.  I think the solution is Archive Awareness; knowing where all the

<em>&gt;best of the previous discussions are, and being able to reference them; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anything new does come along, it can build on the previous discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe someday we'll even have an SL4 FAQ, with archive references.)
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, and someday (post SI) we'll have background processes to go wade 
<br>
though all those archives automatically and highlight all the interesting 
<br>
bits.  But for now I only have a single stream of consciousness and it is 
<br>
very, very busy.
<br>
<p>I have a simple related question.  How is it at all possible that this 
<br>
Sysop API will know what you should &amp; shouldn't do?  Two main points:
<br>
<p>1.  Assuming that the Sysop rules are not hard-coded and monolithic.  In 
<br>
order to decide what you can do, the Sysop API would have to be 
<br>
significantly smarter than you are in order to &quot;judge&quot; your actions.  How 
<br>
likely is that?
<br>
<p>2.  Assuming they are hard-coded and simple.  It is very easy to get around 
<br>
virtually any rule given a reasonably amount of thinking (look at today's 
<br>
laws).  Also, it is sometimes necessary to break the rules for the greater 
<br>
good.  This is the same thing that scares me with today's fly-by-wire jumbo 
<br>
jets.  The pilot can not exceed certain pre-set angles of turn or 
<br>
ascent/descent.  What if there is an emergency and they will die if they do 
<br>
not?  Answer, they die.  I don't like that at all...

<p>P.S.  Hi everyone!  I'll get to writing an introduction RSN (hopefully).  ;)
