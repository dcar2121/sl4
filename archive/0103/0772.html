(Telocity has been resubscribed, FYI, but I asked him to please check with
<br>
me before posting to make sure the format is OK.  I now respond to his
<br>
content.)
<br>
<p>All As are Bs.  Some Bs are Cs.  Does it necessarily follow that some Cs
<br>
are As?
<br>
<p>All apples are fruits.  Some fruits are oranges.  Does it necessarily
<br>
follow that some oranges are apples?
<br>
<p>All religions have apocalyptic elements(*).  The Singularity theorizes
<br>
that we'll shortly see some apocalyptic elements in our world.  Question: 
<br>
Is the Singularity a religion?
<br>
<p>I understand the temptation to apply the Bayesian Probability Theorem -
<br>
which held totally true up until the dawn of Vernor Vinge - and state
<br>
that, if a theory talks about apocalyptic events, that theory must have
<br>
its origin in religion, religious memes, or religious emotions, and that
<br>
the possibility that the theory is grounded in mere fact can therefore be
<br>
discarded.  And I would not argue that this theory works almost all of the
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>However, theories of religious origin can be distinguished from the
<br>
quietly factual in other ways, as well.  Such theories are generally
<br>
accompanied - especially in highly apocalyptic Western theologies - with
<br>
statements such as &quot;Repent or burn!&quot;, moral obligations to believe (assign
<br>
truth values) a particular way, moral obligations not to doubt, unlimited
<br>
suffering heaped upon the heads of the unbelievers, a climactic scene in
<br>
which the true believers are confirmed and get to heap unlimited scorn on
<br>
the nonbelievers, and so on.  For that matter, religious apocalypses can
<br>
be distinguished from nuclear/nanotech/biotech apocalypse, or the
<br>
Singularity, from the tendency of religious people to talk about God!
<br>
<p>There was a time when you could safely dismiss every theory or prediction
<br>
that invoked nonhuman actors.  That time is over.  You must now
<br>
distinguish religious from nonreligious memes by checking for actual
<br>
reference to supernatural causes, or actual distortions of logic, rather
<br>
than simply reasoning from surface similarities.

<p>(*)  IIRC, even Buddhism talks about a time when all souls have achieved
<br>
enlightenment and the universe folds up shop, but I could be remembering
<br>
incorrectly.
