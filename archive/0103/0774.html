Why can't everyone on SL4 be this precise?

<em>&gt; a) There is no convergence. There is only coincidence here.
</em><br>
<p>If there are no causes in common, this is the default assumption.  Someone
<br>
arguing that R and T are somehow intermixed needs to demonstrate a common
<br>
cause.  Not postulate - demonstrate.  Show me the money, because you've
<br>
just made a very serious and very negative accusation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) R causes T. Some philosophers and historians, for example, argued that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion has influenced philosophy which in turn created modern science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (back in the early Enlightenment) which in turn created modern technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religious aspirations to become more than human have piggybacked along the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way.
</em><br>
<p>It's not enough for a bunch of theologians to try and take credit for
<br>
science; there has to be transmission of false or undesirable information
<br>
from religion to science.  Don't postulate; demonstrate; point out a
<br>
specific example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; C) T causes R. I think this is the view that started the thread. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea--familiar from science fiction--is that there is backwards causation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where the secular godlike creatures play an invisible role in the historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulations of the great world religions.
</em><br>
<p>Now *this* is what I would label as a religious meme.  This is the result
<br>
of someone who no longer fully believes in religion, but still
<br>
half-believes in it - the kind of person who's cast off the religion of
<br>
his childhood, but still thinks &quot;Moses made the whole thing up at Mount
<br>
Sinai&quot; rather than &quot;Various parts of the Old Testament were written by
<br>
different authors over a period of time after the tribes had already
<br>
settled in Israel&quot;.
<br>
<p>There is nothing about the religions that needs explaining by reference to
<br>
anything other than people telling stories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another possibility is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity has already occurred in world without religion and we are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living out a simulation. This simulation that we are in is investigatining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what might have happened to human development if humans had believed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion. etc.
</em><br>
<p>Here, again, there is no reason to single out religion as the factor being
<br>
explored.  The existence of religion is fully explained by known, mundane
<br>
causes.  Aside from that this reduces to the usual &quot;What if this world is
<br>
a simulation?&quot; thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; d) There is a common cause for both T and R. Perhaps, for example, evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided us with an innate bias towards singularity. (How implausible is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this? Presumably one would have to think of it as the most grand pleiotropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; event).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it's impossible, at least as I read this statement - evolution
<br>
cannot plan ahead like that, since the future presence or absence of
<br>
Singularity plays no role in the reproductive success of individual
<br>
organisms.  Evolution has no lookahead for an individual, much less a
<br>
species.
<br>
<p>It's possible that, e.g., the Wright Brothers' airplane and the legends of
<br>
levitating yogis both derived from a common human desire to fly, which
<br>
desire in turn is enjoyable because of the way our motor skills or
<br>
parietal lobe evolved to process 3D flight as greater freedom.  It doesn't
<br>
mean that a 747 is a religious icon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; e) Who gives a shit. Either it is a or at least one of b c or d. If a then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing more need be said. If it is one of the others then this knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still be useless--we still need to role up our sleeves and get on with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the task of creating a singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Precisely.  Intermixing religion is just a very distracting, totally
<br>
worthless side issue, which is Why I Don't Want To Hear About It.
