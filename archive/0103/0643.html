<p><p>The problem is that if we presume these levels of technology, then we are

also almost necessarily presuming a huge number of other changes that would

render current military doctrine largely obsolete.  In other words, the

assumption of the technological ability obsoletes the scenario required for 
<br>
the conclusion -- this change in technology won't happen in a vacuum with 
<br>
respect to other military hardware or even to the concept of military 
<br>
conflict itself.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But let's think about what might be possible with computers at 1,000

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm just saying that it seems obvious to me that having _smarter_
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>You don't understand the actual limits on military hardware.  In the real 
<br>
world, hardware is largely limited by physical/mechanical limits rather 
<br>
than computational limits.  The most advanced, fastest systems produced by 
<br>
the U.S. today (i.e. systems that are still in the testing stage) in terms 
<br>
of real-time multiple target discrimination and evaluation typically have a 
<br>
MIPS R2000/R3000 or Motorola 68K as their central 
<br>
processors.  Why?  Because, these &quot;old/slow&quot; chips have more than 
<br>
sufficient computational power for even the most advanced real-time 
<br>
military applications.  Today, the fundamental limits on military 
<br>
technology is material, as they routinely bump up against the theoretical 
<br>
limits of material strength, hardness, toughness, heat resistance, 
<br>
strength-to-weight ratios, etc. which are compounded by mechanical design 
<br>
considerations.  Speed is the king, and computers can already generate 
<br>
directions faster than mechanical devices can physically respond to 
<br>
them.  Therefore, most advances in military capabilities today are done 
<br>
through superior materials and mechanical engineering rather than through 
<br>
computational power.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Now think of a super advanced 50 caliber machine gun...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We aren't going to ask that it be a full-blown AI, or anything like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that.  The soldier carries it around like a regular machine gun, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it has a 'full-auto' mode like the mode on my camera.  When the soldier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pulls the trigger and start spraying bullets, the gun actually times
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the firing of the bullets with an eye towards actually hitting hostiles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and actually trying to miss friendlies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That requires a lot of intelligence.  It requires a serious ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do visual discrimination, and a lot of thought has to go into reducing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;false positives.
</em><br>
<p><p>Impractical, for a number of reasons.  First, you aren't always trying to 
<br>
shoot people with machine guns; there are many good battlefield reasons to 
<br>
shoot virtually anything and clever use of &quot;non-shootable&quot; targets could 
<br>
hinder completion of your mission.  Second, humans frequently can't 
<br>
discriminate friends from enemies even at arms length, and certainly not at 
<br>
a thousand meters; the enemy is not always obvious and may not lend 
<br>
themselves to easy machine discrimination -- what if the enemy is wearing 
<br>
your uniform?  Also, what do you do when an enemy in civilian clothes hides 
<br>
his gun when you point your machine gun at him -- does he become a 
<br>
non-combatant in the eyes of the machine since the machine never saw the 
<br>
gun?  There is a huge amount of visual and non-visual context used in 
<br>
target discrimination by humans that would be virtually impossible to 
<br>
implement in the kind of system you are talking about and I can easily 
<br>
think of dozens of real-world examples that would almost certainly cause 
<br>
problems for the machine.  Third, the machine would have to make this 
<br>
decision *and* re-direct the barrel in a few hundredths of a second through 
<br>
the muzzle blast (which will screw up your sensors) and recoil, never mind 
<br>
that the very rough and somewhat erratic recoil will play hell on your 
<br>
optics and control systems.
<br>
<p>And fourth, there is no bloody way a single soldier would carry a .50 BMG. :^)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;My only general point is that I see military implications for AI, all the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up the chain.  Cool, clear-headed rational thought (particularly specialized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought about identifying hostiles and friendlies) is something that machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can provide on the battlefield.
</em><br>
<p><p>In other words, machines will be used in a sensor data evaluation, fire 
<br>
control, and battlefield advisory role, like they are today.  Humans will 
<br>
still pull the trigger.
