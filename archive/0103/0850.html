</em><br>
<p>I most strongly encourage you to do this. I feel that &quot;ve&quot;, &quot;vis&quot;, etc are 
<br>
just plain annoying. Every time you read it, you mentally replace it with 
<br>
he, himself, etc which leads to slower reading. Even if you can perhaps 
<br>
train yourself out of being annoyed, that should not be allowed to hinder 
<br>
your reading. The suggestion above makes it absolutely clear when you are 
<br>
discussing an AI or a human. The fact that the AI does not have female 
<br>
reproductive organs is a non-issue, just as it is with ships.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I just need to decide whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's worth the switch, irrespective of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1)  How much of a pain in the neck it would be to rewrite everything;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2)  Whether the more foolish members of the male audience are likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less afraid of something that's referred to as &quot;she&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both of these factors, of course, are ethically excluded from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculation.
</em><br>
<p>Why?
<br>
Point 1 is probably not a big problem: search/replace.
<br>
Point 2 is probably more important than you give it credit. Always remember 
<br>
that humans are animals who make lots of decisions based on gut feeling.
<br>
Using &quot;she&quot; for AIs could influence the subconscious to think &quot;mother 
<br>
figure&quot; instead of &quot;dominant male competing for mates/resources&quot; if you use 
<br>
&quot;he&quot;.
<br>
&quot;Ve&quot; just sounds strange and alien, like a robot designation. The gut 
<br>
feeling would be that this is something unknown and therefore to be feared. 
<br>
It does not convey the feeling of something Friendly at all, which is what 
<br>
we want, isn't it?
<br>
<p>I used &quot;he&quot; for AIs in my previous posts, but &quot;she&quot; is probably better, both 
<br>
for the above reasons and for freeing up &quot;he&quot;, referring to humans (being a 
<br>
male myself, I prefer &quot;he&quot; for generic humans, I don't know about 
<br>
others...). Remember also that warning systems in fighter aircraft uses 
<br>
female voices for warnings, since it is more soothing than a male voice.
<br>
<p><p>About FAI:
<br>
Is there any way to get a zipped version of FAI, so I can read it while 
<br>
offline? This could be made available on the website to...
<br>
<p>My first reason for wanting all of FAI on my local drive was to be able to 
<br>
do a search/replace on those annoying vees, but I am willing to wait for you 
<br>
if you go ahead with the changes you discussed... please...?
<br>
<p><p>/Christian
