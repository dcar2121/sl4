OK, I was wrong on this one, I can see this now.  I should have thought
<br>
more carefully.
<br>
<p>First, a side point.  To avoid confusion.  The Webmind AI Engine does
<br>
not use predicate logic at all; the parts of it that are logical in nature
<br>
use a special kind of uncertain term logic....  Furthermore it has a special
<br>
representation for procedural knowledge -- &quot;schema&quot; -- which is different
<br>
from,
<br>
but can be translated into, the declarative logic.
<br>
<p>Second, my main point before should have been stated like this: If a
<br>
philosophy is defined as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- a state of beliefs about the world
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- a habitual set of ways of acting towards the world.
<br>
then any system with a sufficiently flexible way of representing declarative
<br>
knowledge and representing and enacting procedural knowledge, can embody any
<br>
philosophy.
<br>
My statement about HOPL before was restricted to belief, and incorrectly
<br>
ignored procedure.
<br>
<p>But anyway, I guess this statement is of limited value, because it's a
<br>
UTM-type argument,
<br>
which doesn't take into account real-world computational restrictions.  So
<br>
it really
<br>
only applies to superpowerful supercomputer programs in the future.
<br>
<p>For instance, any program that can enact the procedure of emptying out its
<br>
short-term memory
<br>
can in some sense meditate.  But it may not be constructed to as to get the
<br>
same thing out
<br>
of meditation as people do.  So in order to really embody Zen, it would have
<br>
to simulate
<br>
the human mind's type of STM dynamics.  Which requires a superpowerful
<br>
supercomputer level of
<br>
pliability.
<br>
<p>So, I guess my initial statement was wrong.  This issue really is a bit like
<br>
Friendliness.
<br>
After the Singularity, systems may be mutable enough to adapt their
<br>
psychologies to adopt any
<br>
philosophy.  But by giving them the right philosophy pre-Singularity, the
<br>
initial post-singularity
<br>
philosophy may be strongly influenced.
<br>
<p>But what is &quot;the right philosophy&quot;  :&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, any representational system that has equivalent power

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; known philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a very ambitious statement.  Maybe any philosophy within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20th-century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anglo-American analytic philosophy could be represented by higher-order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicate calculus (HOPC).  But consider the following examples:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Zen Buddhism can only be learned by spending a very long time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meditating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Kabbalism should only be learned by married men over 40, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less mentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sturdy people might damage their minds when they learn it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- &quot;Capitalism and Schizophrenia&quot; by Deleuze and Guattari is designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baffle the reader into a position where they realize nothing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything is a matter of interpretation.  (Or something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that-- it's open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to interpretation.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't hold any of these philosophies; I consider them useless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonsense, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless nonsense, respectively.  But they are all philosophies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held by the human mind, but not (I think) represented accurately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by HOPC.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important thing is that to know them involves changes in parts of the mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other than the part that maps neatly into HOPC. They can't be learned by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internalizing lists of claims, which is what HOPC can represent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they cannot be represented by any mind not fairly similar to human,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including its physiological underpinnings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, there is some wiggle room in the word &quot;represent&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently powerful mind could simulate (&quot;imagine&quot;) a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being who held
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a philosophy, and when called upon to act according to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run the simulated entity through a situation, and act the same way.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's representation without understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think restricting your AI to representing things in HOPC is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of cognitive closure Mr. Porter is worried about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --Carl Feynman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS. JOIN message coming soon!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PPS. This just occured to me: &quot;the part of the mind that maps neatly into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HOPC&quot; may be equivalent to &quot;the part of the mind open to conscious belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revision&quot;.  Many philosophies involve changes by means other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief revision.
