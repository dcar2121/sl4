----- Original Message -----
<br>
From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Religion:%20Why%20I%20don't%20want%20to%20hear%20about%20it.">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; There was a time when you could safely dismiss every theory or prediction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that invoked nonhuman actors.  That time is over.  You must now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish religious from nonreligious memes by checking for actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference to supernatural causes, or actual distortions of logic, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than simply reasoning from surface similarities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This thread, I believe, was started by the thought that there might be some
<br>
convergence between religious (R) and (T) technological views on
<br>
singularity. There are several options here among them:
<br>
<p>a) There is no convergence. There is only coincidence here.
<br>
b) R causes T. Some philosophers and historians, for example, argued that
<br>
religion has influenced philosophy which in turn created modern science
<br>
(back in the early Enlightenment) which in turn created modern technology.
<br>
Religious aspirations to become more than human have piggybacked along the
<br>
way.
<br>
C) T causes R. I think this is the view that started the thread. One
<br>
idea--familiar from science fiction--is that there is backwards causation
<br>
where the secular godlike creatures play an invisible role in the historical
<br>
formulations of the great world religions. Another possibility is that the
<br>
singularity has already occurred in world without religion and we are now
<br>
living out a simulation. This simulation that we are in is investigatining
<br>
what might have happened to human development if humans had believed in
<br>
religion. etc.
<br>
d) There is a common cause for both T and R. Perhaps, for example, evolution
<br>
provided us with an innate bias towards singularity. (How implausible is
<br>
this? Presumably one would have to think of it as the most grand pleiotropic
<br>
event).
<br>
e) Who gives a shit. Either it is a or at least one of b c or d. If a then
<br>
nothing more need be said. If it is one of the others then this knowledge
<br>
would still be useless--we still need to role up our sleeves and get on with
<br>
the task of creating a singularity.
<br>
<p>Which, if any of these, is your view?
