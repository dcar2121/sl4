<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>This message is off-topic but the situation has impelled me to post it
<br>
anyway...
<br>
<p>[I would appreciate if none of you would forward this message to other lists
<br>
beyond this one.
<br>
Forwarding it to other individuals who may be interested is OK.  I don't
<br>
particularly need this
<br>
message to be spread across the entire Net.  If there are other lists where
<br>
you think the message
<br>
would be effectively posted, then let me know what they are and I'll post it
<br>
there myself.]
<br>
<p>Anyway...
<br>
<p>Webmind Inc. is in a slightly difficult financial situation at the moment,
<br>
due to a funding
<br>
source pulling out at the last minute after 6 months of negotiations over
<br>
apparently trivial
<br>
points.
<br>
<p>We have a list of VC's who are interested in talking to us, but frankly, the
<br>
market for tech
<br>
companies is in very bad shape right now, so it may be a bit of a challenge.
<br>
So, in the case that
<br>
none of our current contacts comes through, I've decided to cast a pretty
<br>
wide net in looking for
<br>
other potential sources.
<br>
<p>If any of you on this list should have connections with VC's or wealthy
<br>
individuals who you believe
<br>
might be interested in investing in Webmind Inc. during the month of April,
<br>
please e-mail me
<br>
privately and let me know.  We believe we can become profitable by the end
<br>
of the summer.
<br>
<p>Also, on a somewhat related topic.  During the  next few months, while we
<br>
push toward profitability
<br>
based on our AI products, we are interested in bringing in revenue any way
<br>
that we can.  One of our
<br>
assets is a access to a population of very strong Brazilian programmers.  If
<br>
any of you happens to know a firm
<br>
that is interested in hiring some contract programmers in the very short
<br>
term, let me know.  This is
<br>
an &quot;out of the box&quot; way that we might bring in some revenue while
<br>
negotiating for the next round.  Again,
<br>
if you have connection that might help in this regard, please let me know
<br>
privately.
<br>
<p>Our scientific and engineering progress continues to be rapid and exciting,
<br>
and our business side is not
<br>
doing so badly either -- we're negotiating to bring on 20 new sales &amp;
<br>
solutions-delivery guys from a
<br>
recently-defunct knowledge management software firm -- but it's a tough time
<br>
for tech companies as we
<br>
all know...
<br>
<p><p>-- Ben
<br>
<p>p.s. and, with this next round of funding, I promise to hire someone who
<br>
will teach me how to configure
<br>
Outlook properly  ;&gt;
