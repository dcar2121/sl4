<em>&gt; OK, you had a definition for &quot;ending all evil&quot;. My mistake. I had scooped

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;To eliminate all INVOLUNTARY pain, death, coercion, and stupidity from

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Any problems?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the problems remain. While &quot;death&quot; can be clearly defined, &quot;pain&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;coercion&quot; cannot. Have you got separate definitions for these too? Is it
</em><br>
<p>You can go look them up in the dictionary if you aren't sure. But seriously,
<br>
these definitions will only get more well defined as science progresses. The
<br>
sysop will determine the exact boundaries, individually tailored to each
<br>
sentient's own mind and wishes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All interaction between humans includes various degrees of coercion; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestion to persuation to brute force. Where do you draw the line?
</em><br>
<p>I can't say today exactly where that line will be, but it _will_ be drawn
<br>
by the sysop in a sysop scenario. It probably is around brute force unless
<br>
there is too large a separation in intelligence between the particular two
<br>
minds interacting, in which case it might be as far down as suggestion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My original question was meant as a retorical one. The point is, with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective definition of &quot;evil&quot;, there cannot be a uniform set of rules that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will &quot;end all evil&quot; as defined here.
</em><br>
<p>Well in some sense what this all is about is making a science out of it-
<br>
the sysop will have to determine where the boundaries lie when it comes
<br>
to involuntary experiences and conditions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I fail to see the need for discussing concepts like good, evil, morality or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics at all, or how a Power/SI would relate to them. Ethics seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more than rules set up by humans in order to maintain a fairly stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society. I don't see how that can have any meaning in the post-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world or even in the last years leading up to the Singularity. I admit that
</em><br>
<p>I find that a bit hard to believe. Do you think everyone will suddenly just
<br>
become super-nice? Or are you saying that things will become so different
<br>
that &quot;rules&quot; cannot apply?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't read Eleziers &quot;friendly AI&quot;-paper (is it out yet?), but right now,
</em><br>
<p>An interim version was released to this list a month ago:
<br>
<p><a href="http://intelligence.org/CaTAI/friendly/contents.html">http://intelligence.org/CaTAI/friendly/contents.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can see no way to determine how an AI would react towards humans. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything, the most logical thing would probably be either extermination, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced uploading (Best use of material resources). But personally, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather avoid speculation about post-singularity issues completely.
</em><br>
<p>Hiding your head in the sand is probably not a good idea, at least if you
<br>
want to have a say in what comes later.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;The scary thing about that is, who gets to define what constitutes &quot;evil?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Someone has to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, noone has to do it. All we have to do is build a seed AI (unless we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about Asimov Laws...).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The sysop will do it IMO, and it will be a very good thing.
