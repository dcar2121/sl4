</em><br>
<p>To me, this seems to largely be a non issue.  Post Singularity, there 
<br>
will not be much need for children (why would an SI need children 
<br>
when ve can split verself into seperate streams temporarily when 
<br>
necessary).  If an SI did need children, just start a new seed AI. 
<br>
Any SI is going to have to be able to reprogram verself, so there 
<br>
would be no destincion between who started out as an AI and who was 
<br>
post human.
<br>
<p>It should be possible to upload children and just treat them like we 
<br>
would a seed AI:  not fully developed yet but with lots of potential. 
<br>
Plus, you have to consider the age.  I would say that a child under 3 
<br>
years old is not really something worth uploading, since they have 
<br>
not yet developed to a point where they might be something other than 
<br>
just another baby mentally.  In fact, I would say that for several 
<br>
years still it would be until a child had developed enough to be 
<br>
really worth uploading.  If uploaded younger, they would all be 
<br>
pretty much the same because they haven't had enough time to gain 
<br>
many experiences and develop a clearly defined personality.  Of 
<br>
course, many people never really develop a personality and just do 
<br>
whatever everyone else tells them to, but then Eliezer brought up 
<br>
about being iconoclasts not to long ago, so those people who aren't 
<br>
probably won't care to upload (since they're human friends won't tell 
<br>
them to).
<br>
<p>Also, the simulation thing is similar to what I wrote several posts 
<br>
ago in this thread, but since then have thought that there wouldn't 
<br>
really be a need to do that.  It would just be a waste of resources 
<br>
unless there were some sort of mental stagnation going on and the 
<br>
only way around it was to run simulations that might produce 
<br>
something novel to push the SIs forward.
