I personally would not want to be around if SIs start struggling for control 
<br>
of something (like an antique Extro-5 shirt...;-)) and it goes violent.
<br>
Napoleon plus Genghis Kahn, plus all the technology you can imagine wouldn't 
<br>
compare with the utter chaos that would result. and likely, people wouldn't 
<br>
just sit by and let them duke it out, they'd take sides, adding to the chaos 
<br>
and confusion.
<br>
i would hope most people would try to help the SysOp in whatever way they 
<br>
could, adding their feathers of resources and smarts to the battle. But it 
<br>
would be hard for them even to fathom the thrusts and parries of 
<br>
superintelligent warfare.

<p>The problem with my suggestions is that they're simple, and obviously not 
<br>
superintelligent, i was just suggesting thrusts and strategies. threaten 
<br>
citizens, sieze control of citizens, and force SysOp to counter anti-citizen 
<br>
efforts that cost Adversary next to nothing. eh, i dislike thinking about 
<br>
destructive things, it just seems thing lead inevitably to me doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If things get that far... but never mind.  I agree with 1 and 3.  I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quite sure about 2, since the action of the UFSI is predicated on being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to predict the reaction of the FSI, and the FSI might use the &quot;I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not negotiate with terrorists logic&quot; or a variation thereof... but never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind.  The main point is that Gordon Worley seemed to think a group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cooperating Terran UFSIs would be a better protection for the Solar System
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at this point - would minimize total suffering - due to an UFSI's superior
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grasp of battle tactics, or an FSI's unwillingness to tolerate any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;casualties whatsoever, or something like that.
</em><br>
<p>hm. i remember somebody proposing we control SI AIs by playing them off each 
<br>
other, some application of game theory. but i don't think that would work to 
<br>
well. and besides, ten big folk who's interest's HAPPEN to coincide with 
<br>
yours, aren't as good as one big guy who genuinely cares about you.
<br>
<p>or so says my idealist streak.
