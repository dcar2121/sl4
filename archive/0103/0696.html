</em><br>
<p>Wow, could you be more cold and limited?
<br>
<p>So, children in general are a non-issue and those under age 3 aren't 
<br>
&quot;worth&quot; uploading.  Do you suggest tearing them apart for spare atoms then?
<br>
<p>And you assume that SIs will only do what is required.  Sure, SIs should be 
<br>
capable of duplicating themselves, but have you considered that just 
<br>
*maybe* they would *want* to produce new, unique minds?  Unless I am 
<br>
woefully mistaken, the goal is to create intelligence beyond our own that 
<br>
has free will.  I don't know about you, but I have no interest in uploading 
<br>
if I can't enjoy myself on the other side.  Borg is not my idea of an ideal 
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>To be frank, I thought I was on the low end of compassion.  Guess it's time 
<br>
to re-calibrate.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S.  Sorry to everyone for the flame, but I haven't read anything that 
<br>
irked me this much in years.  Obviously he doesn't have kids.
