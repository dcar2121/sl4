<p>How?  When you came to the list, you had to learn the acronyms and 
<br>
new words adopted from science fiction and transhumanist writings 
<br>
that we use (SI, AI, FAI, computronium, etc.), so why are these all 
<br>
that different?
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it is an active choice of the author of a post to use 
<br>
these pronouns.  If you don't like using them, then don't!  Language 
<br>
is changed by its active use (well, at least languages besides French 
<br>
;-)) and if Elizer and me are the only ones left who still refer to 
<br>
SIs with ve, then the word will be dead.  I find it very useful and 
<br>
it eliminates the need for careful sentence structuring that avoids 
<br>
the use of any pronouns (just as physics texts sometimes use a 
<br>
misnomer admintadly because it would be silly to write pages and 
<br>
pages without ever mentioning time or something like that just to get 
<br>
around some issue dealing with the particulars of one theory or 
<br>
another).  I have better things to do than sit around and think up 
<br>
other ways to write the same thing.
<br>
<p>Finally, it is for the dumb matter.  Dogs, books, trees, and my 
<br>
computer are all its.  That guy with a gender change operation is not 
<br>
suddenly dumb matter because ve made a change to vis anatomy.  It is 
<br>
also used to be derogatory towards monsters and such in literature. 
<br>
Since I don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, I stay away from it.
<br>
<p>Elizer mentioned the use of they as if it were singular for a gender 
<br>
neutral person.  I find that many people do this and I even sometimes 
<br>
catch me doing it (some contrustions, like you all, I continue to 
<br>
have no interest in using, but I picked up they before I learned ve 
<br>
and so I have to unlearn it).  I find that this is a poor choice, 
<br>
though, because suddendly one word is now overloaded and the only way 
<br>
to tell which meaning is in use is to listen to the verbs.  This 
<br>
becomes really complicated when using the simple past tense, since 
<br>
subject agreement disapears.  'They went' could either refer to one 
<br>
person or several, so at this point context becomes even more 
<br>
important.  It gets to the point where indefinate pronoun use is 
<br>
threatened.  I choose to avoid all of this by just using ve, which is 
<br>
clearly singular.
<br>
<p>Then again, a few centuries ago thou was dropped for just you, making 
<br>
you take care of both the singular and plural second person.  When 
<br>
using you, everything becomes plural, even if only one person is 
<br>
refered to.  This has led to constructions like the previously 
<br>
mentioned you all to make you more plural.
<br>
<p>So, the short of it is that I will continue to use ve for the gender 
<br>
neutral pronoun of all smart matter, it for dumb matter, and if you 
<br>
don't like it, use something else.  Eventually, if enough people 
<br>
refuse to use it, then I'll have to stop, or I can just continue as I 
<br>
do now, putting a footnote at the first apperance of one of these 
<br>
pronouns in every paper that I write.
