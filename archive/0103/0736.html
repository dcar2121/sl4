<p>Actually, when I use this I change it to &quot;all your base are belong to 
<br>
me&quot;, so some of your comments below I could care less about.  All 
<br>
base will belong to me, so make your time and take off every &quot;zig&quot;, 
<br>
it not matter.  ;-&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does anyone remember the warring memes in John Barnes's _Kaleidoscope
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolved to be able to start taking over a human mind given only a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opening lines?  Isn't &quot;all your base are belong to us&quot; *exactly* what it

</em><br>
<p>No.  If &quot;all your base are belong to us&quot; were it, I doubt that you 
<br>
would have been able to make this post that would cause all of us to 
<br>
guard against it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If a superintelligent AI was locked up in the basement somewhere and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;managed to get thirty bytes out to the real word, don't you think this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what it would sound like?  The thirty bytes, out of 2^240 possibilities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*most* likely to propagate like wildfire among the world's humans?
</em><br>
<p>Well, this must be some AI, since the game is German, AFAIK, and 
<br>
several years old.  All the jokes come from the bad translation to 
<br>
English.  If there is an AI out there that can manipulate people to 
<br>
translate games from the early 90s/late 80s into mind controlling 
<br>
memes, give me the address where I can mail order one!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Are these thirty bytes a distress call - a &quot;Please trace me and free me&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or are they a memetic attack designed to blossom inside our helpless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;minds; words with strange rhythms and resonances that not only propagate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like wildfire but act as the carrier wave for future orders?  Or, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Internet linking the world together, have we been breeding hyper-virulent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memes - not just ideas, now, but short sentences?
</em><br>
<p>I'm hoping that you're not serious.  Wait, I see, maybe this post was 
<br>
all humor (I've fixed it, but instead of humor I originally typed 
<br>
human ;-)) and I've just taken it the wrong way.  Yeah, I think I 
<br>
read this one before, it was right after the article on Bigfoot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Should we be living in fear?  Is this innocent-sounding phrase merely the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;start of something far more sinister?  Will we see crowds swaying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;zombielike through the streets, chanting &quot;All your base are belong to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us&quot;?  Wouldn't that be *great*?  Don't you want to join the next crowd you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can find and see if you can get them to start repeating it?
</em><br>
<p>Surely you jest.  The I'm not worried about words like &quot;all your base 
<br>
are belong to us&quot; doing anything to me.  I mean, what can the human 
<br>
mind do with them besides think 'wow, that's a really bad bit of 
<br>
English' or 'ha, ha, pretty funny'.   A lot of this post seems to be 
<br>
based on some kind of pseudo science human programming idea.  Anyone 
<br>
who takes this thing seriously probably deserves to become a zombie.
