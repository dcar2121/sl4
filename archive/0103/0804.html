<p>
We are talking about the future of our species.  There are over 3 billion 
<br>
individual minds currently in existence on the Earth.  Sometime in the not 
<br>
so distant future it is likely that they will be able to upload and become 
<br>
SIs.  So far, so good.
<br>
<p>But then everyone keeps talking about this Sysop and what &quot;it&quot; wants.  No 
<br>
one really seems to care about what any of those 3 billion individual minds 
<br>
might want.  The worst description I've heard to date is that all of these 
<br>
individuals just become sub-goals of the almighty Sysop.  Maybe the Sysop 
<br>
will want to do this, or that, or the other thing.
<br>
<p>Has anyone considered that maybe, just maybe, some of those 3 billion 
<br>
INDIVIDUAL minds might actually want to do something?  Maybe they want to 
<br>
go look around the universe.  Maybe they want to do VR sims of Tom &amp; Jerry 
<br>
24 hours a day.  Whatever, but what THEY (we) want should be the #1 
<br>
priority here.
<br>
<p>The Sysop is the ultimate artificial &quot;guardian&quot; of a particular view of 
<br>
human morals.  Nothing more.  Becoming a SI is supposed to &quot;improve&quot; life 
<br>
by reducing the arbitrary limits we are bound to.  So why the hell are we 
<br>
trying this hard to place new arbitrary limits before we even manage to 
<br>
remove any of our current ones?
<br>
<p>I don't know about any of you, but I don't want to live the rest of my life 
<br>
in a communist paradise.
