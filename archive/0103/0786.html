</em><br>
<p>Actually, my question lies in the involuntary stupidity.  How do you define 
<br>
that?  The simple solution, is that the &quot;friendly&quot; SI force feeds 
<br>
everything it knows into every Power, which for the most part makes 
<br>
everyone the same.  So we end up with Billions of 99.9999% identical 
<br>
minds.  Boring.  I find it difficult to believe that you could force a 
<br>
being with near infinite intelligence to be stupid in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;All interaction between humans includes various degrees of coercion; from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggestion to persuation to brute force. Where do you draw the line?
</em><br>
<p>Hey, this would make it impossible to talk humans into uploading.  Possibly 
<br>
making it impossible to get anyone to upload at all.  This could explain 
<br>
the *poof* scenario where all Powers vanish, never to be heard from 
<br>
again.  (and thus very few, if anyone, follows)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;The scary thing about that is, who gets to define what constitutes &quot;evil?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Someone has to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, noone has to do it. All we have to do is build a seed AI (unless we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are talking about Asimov Laws...).
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  The only thing that worries me about the future, is this point 
<br>
right here.  That human individuals are going to try and influence rules 
<br>
post-SI so that it becomes their personal concept of utopia.  I would hope 
<br>
that Powers are inherently friendly in virtually all cases by nature.  In 
<br>
any case I thought that the idea of us providing rules for the other side 
<br>
had been totally, and completely proven a terrible idea.  For example, 
<br>
forcing Asimov Laws was said to be a horrible idea because it is impossible 
<br>
to determine exactly what they would become after thousands, or even 
<br>
millions of upgrades.  Does that not equally apply to &quot;friendliness&quot;?
