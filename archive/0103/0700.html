</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with the Borg is that its a trap, a one way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trip, a roach motel.  What if we could voluntarily join
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Borg, play in that until we were satisfied, then get back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to our individual existence at will?  Wouldnt that be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way cool?
</em><br>
<p>The Borg may wind up being the less unpalatable alternative.
<br>
If I had to choose between an organic mesh of human and
<br>
infosystems (i.e. a much  more seamless version of what is essentially
<br>
the present state of affairs) or remaining an &quot;unmodified human&quot; with
<br>
the Godlike Sysop in charge of my destiny... I know which one I'd
<br>
pick.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granted I would like very much to be a &quot;small intimate Borg&quot;
<br>
composed of a few thousand genetically near-identical bodies,
<br>
all unified by a common set of memetics.  But I'd go big before
<br>
I'd migrate permanently to a VR. I have a thousand years of 
<br>
realTime before I'm ready for that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Something else I would like to point out....
<br>
&nbsp;It's obvious reading the writings of the &quot;singularity's friends&quot;
<br>
that they tend to think in terms of &quot;Before Singularity&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;After Singularity&quot;. What's motivating this &quot;discrete point&quot;
<br>
vision of the transhuman future? shouldn't the perception be
<br>
a steepening CURVE? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I can think of which might produce a &quot;single
<br>
point&quot; style &quot;event horizon&quot; is the invention of Eli's hyper-evolving
<br>
transhuman AI, and only then in a world lacking competitors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The inclusion of infosystems directly into the cortex of humanity
<br>
will be a gradual process (taking at least a few years, at least)
<br>
(imagine that as a nanoprank...everybody wakes up with neurojacks!).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly nano-heaven (a la Diaspora or what have you) doesn't arrive
<br>
the moment the first general purpose assembler comes on line.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All these things may happen extremely quickly by the standards of
<br>
past human history...but the curve is still extant, just abbreviated into
<br>
decades or even years producing unrecognizable change.
<br>
<p>just a thought,
<br>
