<p>
This is my joining message.
<br>
<p>I was born in 1962.
<br>
<p>In 1966, I played with the world's smallest microelectromechanical
<br>
device, a 400 micron electric motor, which my father kept in the drawer
<br>
with his handkerchiefs, just above my eye level.  He told me the many
<br>
wonderful things that would happen when tiny machines are
<br>
mass-produced.  I'm still waiting (:-)
<br>
<p>I went to MIT and got a BS in Philosphy &amp; Linguistics.  Then I got an MS
<br>
in EE &amp; CS.  During this period, I hung around the MIT AI Lab, fiddling
<br>
with various AI projects.  I spent the '80s working on parallel
<br>
computers for AI applications, at MIT and Thinking Machines
<br>
Corporation.  I also did some very cool machine vision stuff.  Then
<br>
around '90 I got sick of both AI (which was clearly going nowhere) and
<br>
working for the DoD (which clearly wanted to use AI to kill people, in
<br>
bulk).
<br>
<p>I spent the first half of the '90s sending way to much email to the
<br>
Extropians list.  I also got married, started a family and started
<br>
making money.  All this took too much time to do anything technically
<br>
interesting.  In the second half of the '90s, I applied some machine
<br>
learning techniques to various Internet things.  For the past few years,
<br>
I've been working for Ab Initio Software, which is doing extremely cool
<br>
stuff I can't talk about.  Don't worry, we're not trying to get to the
<br>
singularity first.
<br>
<p>I have a wife and two daughters, ages 5 and 7.  My instincts tell me
<br>
they are wonderful and perfect and more valuable than life itself.  I'm
<br>
going with my instincts on this one.
<br>
<p>For a technological optimist, I'm awfully pessimistic.  When I was
<br>
Eliezer's age, it was 1983.  It was clear to me, then, that by the year
<br>
2001, we'd have space colonies, artificially intelligent supercomputers,
<br>
self-reproducing nanotech assemblers, brain-computer interfaces,
<br>
holographic TV, cheap diamond, solar powered hydrogen production, a
<br>
worldwide hypertext system containing all human knowledge, photo-quality
<br>
computer graphics, and laptop computers.  We only got three out of
<br>
nine.  My experience is that almost anything new and exciting is wrong.
<br>
So my first response to any visionary proposal or exciting piece of news
<br>
is to explain why it will never amount to anything.  I've been
<br>
restraining myself from dumping too much wet sand on the stuff bandied
<br>
about on this list, so as to preserve the list's delightful air of
<br>
youthful enthusiasm.
<br>
<p>I will now wax enthusiastic about an article I just read. It's called
<br>
&quot;Defining brain wiring patterns and mechanisms through gene trapping in
<br>
mice&quot;, and it's in the 8 March issue of Nature.  Through some piece of
<br>
biochemical prestidigitation that uses too many acronyms for me to
<br>
understand, these biologists can modify mice so that brain cells that
<br>
express a certain protein will have their cell bodies stained blue and
<br>
their axons stained purple.  This tells them the wiring diagram for that
<br>
kind of cell: the inputs are here, and the outputs are over there.  They
<br>
can then disrupt the gene and see how the wiring pattern changes, and
<br>
how that affects the poor mice.  They can do this for randomly selected
<br>
brain proteins, even ones that haven't been discovered-- so far they
<br>
have done it for 120 known proteins and 43 new ones.  Many of them
<br>
outline particular cell types in particular regions of the brain.  They
<br>
can look at the mice brains at various stages of development and watch
<br>
the purple axons grow across the brain and hook up to their
<br>
destinations.  They can disrupt one protein and see how it affects the
<br>
growth of other types of labeled cells.
<br>
<p>It's a colossal torrent of neuroanatomical information-- too much to
<br>
really handle by existing methods of understanding.  All this was done
<br>
by just eight people.  It used to be that eight people could find maybe
<br>
one wiring tract per decade, if they were lucky.  Now they are speeding
<br>
that up by three orders of magnitude.  There are at most a thousand cell
<br>
types in the brain, total.  At this rate, we'll have a pretty good
<br>
high-level wiring diagram for all of them in a few years.
<br>
<p>Here's the abstract:

<br>
<p>And here's the site where they hand out the information to everyone:
