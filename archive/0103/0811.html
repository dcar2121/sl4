<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I fail to see the need for discussing concepts like good, evil, morality

<em>&gt; &gt;or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ethics at all, or how a Power/SI would relate to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This seems like a very limited and inhuman[e] view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the SI is non-human after all (see above), and it is the actions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SI that will matter post-singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That misses the point I was attempting to make.  Any sentient among
<br>
other sentients requires some system of ethics, of fundamental working
<br>
principles governing association with others.  Even, &quot;I wish to do this
<br>
and there is no being with the power to stop me so I will&quot; is a form of
<br>
ethics.  If that was the only ethics we could predict an SI will have
<br>
then we would have very reasonable basis to consider the acheivement of
<br>
such a being extremely problematic and not so much an acheivement as the
<br>
creation and letting loose of a super-powerful, super-intelligent demon
<br>
of our own making.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;If there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;ethics then there are no guiding principles to your actions, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;abstraction of what is truly in your self-interest longterm or not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since it is my belief that the post-singularity world will be unknowable, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of long-term is on the order of 20-25 years. My guiding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles is reaching singularity as fast as possible. If you want to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that ethics, that's fine with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That it is unknowable in any detail does not mean that all principles
<br>
and fundamental necessities of peaceful co-existence go away or are no
<br>
longer worth talking or thinking about.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;every decision governing whether to take an action is utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;seat-of-the-pants at that moment.  You also cannot depend on any context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for the actions of others as they will make their own seat-of-the-pants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(pls excuse physical metaphors) decisions moment by moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree. Humans act in their own self-interest. They have done so in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past, and they will probably continue to do so in the future. However, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the time it is in their own self-interest to be nice to members of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;pack&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But it is not seat-of-the-pants because that is too chaotic.  We instead
<br>
develop social norms that, imperfect as they are, allow some semblance
<br>
of order and reasonable expectations in our interactions.  It is not as
<br>
simple as &quot;pack&quot; mentality.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be no level of trust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you organize yourself in a &quot;pack&quot; and follow the rules set up there, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get personal protection and greater means of achieving your goals (they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normally coincide with those of the pack). When you interact with another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pack-member, you can be pretty sure that he/she will not break the rules and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk exclusion from the pack. This can be called trust. The rules that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pack sets up can be called ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why is it that some people in attempting to be scientific relegate human
<br>
beings to the level of a wolf pack and expect AIs to have not even that
<br>
much social cohesion or sense of ethics?   Ethics are not simply pack
<br>
mentality. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Ethics seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; little more than rules set up by humans in order to maintain a fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; society. I don't see how that can have any meaning in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;post-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; world or even in the last years leading up to the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What, the need goes away for stable associations of entities?  How &gt;so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There will ONE relevant entity. This entity will IMO relate to humans as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relate to bacteria. We do not make stable associations with bacteria.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How so?  I do not believe that there will only be One or that other
<br>
beings are irrelevant simply by virtue of being far less intelligent and
<br>
capable.  If I believed that I would be forced to fight against the
<br>
creation of an SI with all of my power. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Again, the unknowability assumption makes it impossible to predict anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To me this is a huge cop-out.  Yes, we may not be able to influence the
<br>
design and evolution of SIs much, but if we say simply that we can't
<br>
predict everything and therefore will not even try then we deserve
<br>
whatever we get.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The need for stable associations and for governing primary ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;principle if anything increases as the entities get more powerful and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;capable of greater harm and as the interactions and activities get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;orders of magnitude more complex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So you think one SI being alone (assuming this doubtful assumption for
<br>
now) has no need of ethics at all?
