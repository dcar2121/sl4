</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * What level of intelligence rises to the level of sentience respected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the sysop/government as a person or equivalent? Animals we need not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern ourselves with -- look at what we currently do with lab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals.
</em><br>
<p>As the hand waiving author the original post, I feel obligated to 
<br>
clarify:
<br>
<p>The Sysop shall prevent all suffering. Animals shall not suffer, ever.
<br>
Plants shall not suffer, ever. Virii shall not suffer ever. Well, ok,
<br>
maybe not. But whatever the level is, let the Sysop determine what 
<br>
constitutes sentience and disallow (what constitutes) suffering. 
<br>
<p>If you try to set your sister's cat on fire: (API) Error. The nanostuff
<br>
of which everything is made will not allow you to do it. (Hey, I wonder
<br>
if I can get a stack trace with that?) This sort of scenario was 
<br>
described in previous posts. I wrongly assumed everyone would have read
<br>
them. Maybe my original &quot;Sentients As Temporary Variables&quot; will make
<br>
more sense to you now (Dammit, we need Xanadu Threaded Discussions!...
<br>
or I need web access so I can cross reference to the right archived
<br>
post).
<br>
<p>But even without defining what level of complexity implies sentience,
<br>
we still have the problem: When a suitably complex simulation is
<br>
created to be deemed sentient, the Sysop shall prevent that simulation
<br>
from ever encountering harm or wrongful termination (according to
<br>
Friendliness).
<br>
<p>If you had created me as a simulation, you could not (as in &quot;would not
<br>
be able to&quot;) hurt me because the Sysop will prevent it. So if you keep
<br>
creating sentient beings which you cannot erase, at some point you
<br>
might run into resource problems, yes? Have I made the problem clear?
<br>
There are obvious solutions: each new sentience must have a guaranteed
<br>
amount of computational resources to pursue, life, liberty and
<br>
happiness, blah, blah, blah. 
<br>
<p>(Imagine what will happen when the Mormons upload...and if they each 
<br>
upload with 2 uplifted rabbits which are each residing in yards with 2 
<br>
tribbles... :) (please note: I have nothing against Mormons, rabbits,
<br>
yards or tribbles))
<br>
<p>Now what does this &quot;inability to erase or injure&quot; imply?
<br>
<p>If Friendliness protects all sentients, simulated or otherwise, then
<br>
the world as we live in it now, cannot be a simulation run under the
<br>
rules of Friendliness...or that is one conclusion anyway. I thought I
<br>
could bring together the ideas of being in a simulation with our
<br>
notion of Friendliness. When I did, I found a big conflict which 
<br>
surprised me.
<br>
<p>There is the possibility that Friendliness lapses long enough for 
<br>
someone to run the entire universe sim again (the sim can run faster
<br>
than &quot;real&quot; time...eg. perhaps it can be sent as a signal at close
<br>
the speed of light). 
<br>
<p>But, ack, no one really wanted to discuss the point (or I mangled it
<br>
too severely). Philosophizing can become quite laborious...
