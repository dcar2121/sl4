<p>(I'll have to read the webpage when I get home...)
<br>
<p>I recently finished Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon about cracking the
<br>
Enigma code during WWII. Without giving too much away, I was impressed
<br>
by the amount of effort spent on trying to cover up the fact that one
<br>
had cracked the other side's codes by providing lots of misinformation
<br>
to &quot;noisy-up&quot; the data. If you can suddenly destroy all the
<br>
otherside's warships because you know where they are, they'll change
<br>
their codes.  If you remove all your civilians from a city that's
<br>
going to be bombed they'll know too...You get the idea.
<br>
<p>So let's frame this competition in the current thread. If I were the
<br>
post-singularity hive-mind resimulating everyone who has ever lived
<br>
(cf. Tipler), I would want to hide this fact from everyone I was
<br>
re-simulating...In fact, I would probably want to hide it from all
<br>
levels of the new SI. I would want to add sufficient &quot;noise events&quot; to
<br>
keep anyone from figuring it out. In the &quot;original&quot; reality, some
<br>
people would have guessed this end result on their own and it would be
<br>
false. In all subsequent simulations, they would have guessed this end
<br>
result and would be right (that yes, they are being sim'ed).
<br>
<p>As the universal ubermind, I would probably spend the rest of my time
<br>
(ie. until the end of the universe) re-building this simulation, since
<br>
really: What would be more interesting to calculate once I didn't have
<br>
to worry about dying or turning enough of the universe into
<br>
computronium?  Because I'd be the ultimate-paragon mind living at the
<br>
far end of time, I'd probably have a pretty good idea how to do
<br>
this. Having practiced this final instant throughout the eons, and in
<br>
my last few moments (of my own simulation?), I would rerun the
<br>
entirety of everything that had taken place in my supposed reality.
<br>
<p>That is, 
<br>
<p>If I were going to go back and re-sim the birth of the singularity, I
<br>
would do most of the things the same (ie, get all the important
<br>
details right), but I would leave little clues that it had all been
<br>
done before. Not enough to make it obvious, but enough to drive most
<br>
people (and SI's) mad with wondering ;-) This would have the double
<br>
bonus of making reality the most elaborate inside
<br>
(ie. recursively-inside) joke ever.
<br>
<p>I'd whisper this in the ear of the person building the SI and then let
<br>
it nag whomever thinks it...for the rest of time...
<br>
<p>Hah! ;-)
<br>
<p>PS - What I'm not so sure about in this scenario is if reality would
<br>
repeat itself exactly or if clues would be left for subsequent SI's on
<br>
how to improve the simulation, the next time around. The most pleasing
<br>
answer to me is if the SI would believe ve was making improvements,
<br>
but at that last possible existential instant as the SI, master of the
<br>
universe, slips into the hands-off simulation of the next reality, ve
<br>
realizes that the most perfect form had already been converged upon
<br>
and that this was it, that this has always been the only true
<br>
solution...all ready to go again...and then doubt verself one last 
<br>
time. 
<br>
<p>(I call this the &quot;alpha&quot; theory to go with Tipler's &quot;omega&quot;
<br>
theory...which I still haven't read, BTW).
<br>
<p>meow.
