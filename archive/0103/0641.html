<p><p>Many studies done by the U.S. military in the 50s and 60s indicate that 
<br>
only about 4% of soldiers in the U.S. military are truly effective in 
<br>
combat, and maybe only 15% are even useful.  The rest are dead-weight at 
<br>
best and useless bullet-stops at worst.  Therefore the U.S. military has 
<br>
moved to have most of their personnel supporting the small percentage of 
<br>
combat soldiers that actually are capable of effectively engaging the 
<br>
enemy.  As a result, the average effectiveness of line soldiers has 
<br>
increased markedly.  Which isn't to say that you don't have a point, just 
<br>
that the problems you state can be largely solved with simple and 
<br>
time-honored methods of selection.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There is little question that a smart killing machine could easily defeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;normal human soldiers.  Intelligence is needed to move about in an unfamiliar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment, and for identification of armed targets (versus innocent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bystanders).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Prioritization of targets involves rapidly judging the intentions (and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the actions) of various people and things in the combat arena.
</em><br>
<p><p>Machines of this level of capability would be vastly more expensive (and on 
<br>
many levels, more complicated) than their human counterparts.  Any 
<br>
competent and motivated military organization can produce high-grade combat 
<br>
units with a relatively small investment.
<br>
<p>You overlook the combat strengths of light infantry in a theater of 
<br>
operations.  The obvious disadvantages of human soldiers is that they have 
<br>
low firepower, modest speed, and are poorly armored.  However, they have 
<br>
the enormous value of being extraordinarily adaptive to changing 
<br>
conditions, very resistant to the environment, far more durable than 
<br>
machines, and capable of operating with very little logistical support.
<br>
<p>Our bodies have evolved to survive under a broad range of adverse 
<br>
conditions that machines are not even close to being capable of 
<br>
supporting.  The average military truck has a life span of about 15,000 
<br>
miles and requires very regular maintenance and parts replacement; this may 
<br>
seem short, but unlike your car and other vehicles that travel on a 
<br>
carefully manicured and purely artificial environment called &quot;pavement&quot;, 
<br>
military trucks have to be able to travel most places a person can.  As any 
<br>
military person will tell you, logistics will make or break a combat 
<br>
operation.  I am extraordinarily skeptical that any kind of advanced 
<br>
military machine would not require massive quantities of technical support 
<br>
in the foreseeable future.
<br>
<p>The relevance of this is, after decades of research and refinement, the 
<br>
military can still not put a vehicle as simple as a truck in the field 
<br>
without a small company of people to support it, and that it will break on 
<br>
a very regular basis is a given.  If you want to stop The Ultimate Killing 
<br>
Machine, you simply attack the vast human support structure required to 
<br>
keep it operational in the field; it will be out of commission in a day or 
<br>
two due to lack of logistical support.  In fact, attacking support elements 
<br>
is standard doctrine for stopping any advanced piece of war machinery; a 
<br>
couple guys with guns and explosives can effectively stop an air wing of 
<br>
the most advanced aircraft without taking a single shot at the aircraft 
<br>
themselves.  All the cool toys in the world won't help you if you can't 
<br>
keep them running.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Smart military machines could enter a dangerous urban environment and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systematically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and quickly take out armed targets with (relatively) minimal damage to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilians.
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, at this level of technology, humans have proven to be far more 
<br>
robust and reliable.  Our biology allows us to operate very well in our 
<br>
native environment.  Even a machine with the mental capabilities of a human 
<br>
would be at an extraordinary disadvantage from a logistical standpoint and 
<br>
would likely only be used in very limited scenarios where such a machine 
<br>
could be safely supported.  While humans may not have the armor of 
<br>
machines, we tend to be far more durable and damage resistant than 
<br>
machines, and of course, are self-repairing and for the most part 
<br>
self-supplying.  The trend has therefore been to augment human abilities; 
<br>
it is cheaper and more effective for many military missions.
