<br>
<em>&gt; I would like to encourage everyone _other than Eliezer_ to avoid using his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goofball manner of speaking.  It makes this list look like a bunch of
</em><br>
kooks,
<br>
<em>&gt; frankly, and there is absolutely no valid reason for it.  (I've asked
</em><br>
Eliezer
<br>
<em>&gt; to explain it to me, and I think his explanation is not good enough.)
</em><br>
<p>That isn't Eliezer's personal vocabulary, it's the collection of words he
<br>
finds useful from the vast glossary of goofball
<br>
Scientific/SF/Hacker/Transhuman culture.  Grok.  Nusuth.  Amortal.  Upload.
<br>
Meme.  The reason for these words is that they represent shared concepts
<br>
that cannot be comfortably or reliably communicated by twisting the grammar
<br>
of everyman English.  The only way to get rid of them is to invent better
<br>
alternatives.
<br>
<p>Who looks like a kook is a question of who's doing the looking, anyway.
<br>
Engineers, deep-sea divers, politicians, combat veterans, usenet regulars,
<br>
aristocracy, hairdressers, your parents and their school friends, all groups
<br>
have their own private goofball extensions to the common language, and the
<br>
generally useful ones tend to filter up.  (Eg: Fubar, 'Cool')
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gender-neutral writing need not be tortured.  And gender neutral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing about AIs is particularly easy, as compared to gender neutral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing about humans.  The difficulty with humans is that they *do*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a gender, but we may not wish to specify which gender.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes for a _slightly_ difficult situation, particularly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inexperienced or clumsy writers.
</em><br>
<p>Human gender is a multidimensional spectrum of reality that fits only
<br>
clumsily into the dyadic Male/Female categories, and people have been
<br>
surgically mutilated at birth in attempts to deny this.  Even with humans,
<br>
there is a need for a gender neutral pronoun, and it will only become
<br>
stronger as our options increase.  'Ve' works.  Read a few Egan short story
<br>
collections, you soon get used to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no such difficulty when writing about AIs.  Because they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological humans, they _do not have a gender_.  Therefore, we can use
</em><br>
'it'.
<br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer claims that using &quot;it&quot; gets to be too difficult and confusing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I strongly disagree.
</em><br>
<p>'It' isn't just grammatically restrictive, it's the wrong word.  'It' means
<br>
something non-mind.  A brick.  A photon.  A tree.  Anything far enough down
<br>
the complexity scale that the idea of 'murder' does not apply.  I would be
<br>
uncomfortable applying this word to any possibly conscious AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If anyone can come up with an example of a thought that can't clearly be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed using normal English words, but for which 've/ver' helps...
</em><br>
please do so.
<br>
<p>Anything -can- be expressed using he, she, it and they, but it's an ugly
<br>
hack if you don't -mean- he, she, it or they.  Any suggestion that people
<br>
use language more comfortable to them if and only if it is an absolute
<br>
gramattical necessity has the tone of special pleading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm happy to take this off-list if the powers that be feel it is
</em><br>
inappropriate.
<br>
<em>&gt; My argument that it *is* appropriate is that we need to move as quickly as
</em><br>
possible
<br>
<em>&gt; on this list to understand each other, and to make this list accessible to
</em><br>
newcomers.
<br>
<em>&gt; Having a special (and _pointless_, mind you) set of pronouns really
</em><br>
doesn't help.
<br>
<p>Surely all newcomers to SL4 are at least occasional SF readers who have
<br>
managed to look at some of the CaTAI and Singularity papers without
<br>
dismissing Eliezer as a loony.  To me, that suggests the ability to cope
<br>
with the occasional use of words like 'verself'.
