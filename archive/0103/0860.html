Hello all,
<br>
<p>As a student and a newcomer to the Singularity and the exploration of sl4 
<br>
issues in general, I find using gender-nuetral pronouns quite helpful. When I 
<br>
disseminate material, I write my interpretation of the material down, so I can 
<br>
read it later, and share with those around me my interpretation.
<br>
<p>When I first read through CatAI, it was the first of anything like close to 
<br>
sl4 that I had ever read. It was comforting to me to know that people had 
<br>
thought out in such detail that even the pronouns had changed, and I was 
<br>
impressed by the professional feel the gender-nuetral pronouns gave me.
<br>
<p>When my friends read my disseminations of ideas sl4-ish, some have reacted 
<br>
like me, and some, being German thought the use was great fun. It opened up 
<br>
the conversation by giving them something non-threatening to ask about, and 
<br>
even make their own opinion on.
<br>
<p>When some of my friends think, gee this girl is a weirdo, her ideas are way 
<br>
out there, it is not the use of ve and ver that causes them to say this. I 
<br>
have had only one of my fellow students totally not be able to accept the 
<br>
gender nuetral pronouns, and he admitted it hindered him in accepting my 
<br>
interpretation of things sl4-ish, but that he would probably not have accepted 
<br>
anything sl4-ish anyway.
<br>
<p>The use of gender-nuetral pronouns provides a useful distancing of concepts 
<br>
that would otherwise seem way too threatening to accept for some people. This 
<br>
is helpful, because in these people can in their scorn mull over sl4-ish 
<br>
issues without losing face. It is my hope that the use of gender-nuetral 
<br>
pronouns continues and spreads, because it reflects the differences between 
<br>
AIs and humans.
<br>
<p>Refering to AIs as a him or a her is prejudiced. When dealing with a foreign 
<br>
culture, you do not treat them as your own culture, you must take into account 
<br>
thier differences and celebrate them. Being Alaska Native, I have seen this 
<br>
first hand, where people in attempt to create equality between the races, 
<br>
treat Alaska Natives as white people. This is a prejudiced reaction, as Alaska 
<br>
Natives are not white. As if white people were the only measuring stick. 
<br>
Therefore treating AIs like humans is prejudiced against the AIs.
<br>
<p>Using gender-nuetral pronouns furthur brings to mind the differences between 
<br>
AIs and humans, and therefore helps to avoid applying anthropomorphic ideas to 
<br>
them. Perhaps someone could sing a song of our differences and we could take 
<br>
pride in our effort to accept one another. We do this in INupiaq Eskimo 
<br>
culture and it helps. In the exploration of differences, we see how alike we 
<br>
really are to each other. I am very interested in seeing this concept brought 
<br>
up, as it is one step of many to bringing AIs and humans not furthur apart, 
<br>
but closer together in our understanding.
<br>
<p>CLOSER, not furthur. Onward, deeper into Egypt.
