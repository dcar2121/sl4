From: James Higgins &lt;<a href="mailto:jameshiggins@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Gender%20Neutral%20Pronouns">jameshiggins@earthlink.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I very much agree with this.  He/she is much easier for the reader, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are already accustomed to reading about non-gendered entities using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  God is usually referred to as a &quot;he&quot;, but many (most?) people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe God is non-gendered.  Or at the very least could take on any
</em><br>
gender
<br>
<em>&gt; he so choose at any time.  If talking about non-gendered, all knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities for thousands of years has not spawned the creation of gender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neutral pronouns, I think it is a lost cause.
</em><br>
<p>I think for the vast majority of those centuries, God has been very much a
<br>
he.  Patriarchal societies, women as property, 'Heavenly Father', big white
<br>
beard in the sky, etc.  The ethereal, chtonic, light the blue touch paper
<br>
and sit back, gender-neutral God is a very recent invention, and nothing
<br>
like as successful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; May very well be true, but 've' still sounds goofy.  I hear more stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments about those pronouns than anything else in the papers when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest others read them.  That indicates to me that they are a problem.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting.  I suspect that this is a general resistance to the concept of
<br>
ungendered people, more than a particular hatred for the letter V.  Perhaps
<br>
a perceived overlap with political correctness is part of the problem.  I
<br>
suggest a quick &amp; dirty search &amp; replace as a temporary technical solution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;When I was walking home from school a large, black, dog appeared ahead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me.  It came running at me while growling, which made me very scared.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ran the other way as fast as possible and jumped a fence before it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch me.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That is a dog taking the role of primal fear monster, of course 'it' works
<br>
for that.  Likewise insane hollywood AI (Shodan) and even enemy people when
<br>
suitably demonised.  That doesn't make 'it' suitable for dogs generally.
<br>
Okay, here's a more human centric rule of thumb: 'It' means something that
<br>
doesn't have a -name-.  The seed AI will likely go through a ton of names.
<br>
(And nicknames)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Dogs are not gender neutral, but that works just fine.  And, last I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checked, dogs had minds.  If someone went up to your puppy and blew it
</em><br>
away
<br>
<em>&gt; with a shotgun, the newspaper headlines would read &quot;Puppy murdered in cold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blood&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>And nowhere in the articles would the late Mr. Wuzzums be referred to as
<br>
'it'.  The killer might be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, but the question is, how many more would not dismiss it as loony if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used standard pronouns?  Using us as a sample is biased.  This information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will eventually apply to, and need to be read by, the general public.
</em><br>
Just
<br>
<em>&gt; because we can look at the facts and say &quot;this makes sense&quot;, doesn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any relevance on if the general public could do the same.
</em><br>
<p>No argument there, but eventually is the key word.  Introductions will be,
<br>
as you say, available in levels and stages, with appropriately targeted
<br>
ideas and language, not merely as a raw text dump of the entire SL4 archive.
<br>
Meanwhile, I'm still assuming that anyone reading this right now has already
<br>
progressed through SL1-3 in their own time.
