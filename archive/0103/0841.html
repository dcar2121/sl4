<p>A ship is so unlike a human we can safely use &quot;she&quot; without falsely 
<br>
implying a link between ships and people. What to call an AI has to be 
<br>
considered much more carefully. Do we want an AI to be anthropomorphized - 
<br>
this could give people a false impression of what an AI is. I suppose it 
<br>
depends on how the AI is coded. Is the intention to create an AI with a 
<br>
human type personality (ie a hyperintelligent and super fast brain using 
<br>
alternative hardware) or something with completely different intelligence 
<br>
structure. (Sorry if you have answered this already Eliezer. I'm still 
<br>
going  through your Low Beyond resource).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1)  How much of a pain in the neck it would be to rewrite everything;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2)  Whether the more foolish members of the male audience are likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less afraid of something that's referred to as &quot;she&quot;.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both of these factors, of course, are ethically excluded from the

</em><br>
<p>If we truly believe that Singularity will end all suffering is it unethical 
<br>
to not select memes that will aid acceptance of Singularity? I suppose by 
<br>
this I mean the way of presenting facts, certainly not falsifying evidence 
<br>
or covering up facts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Now *that* has an impact on me.  (Why?  Usually, when I hear someone say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Other people won't like X.&quot;, my response is &quot;Take responsibility for your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own reactions; if you don't like X, say so.&quot;  But if you're actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*seeing* other people react badly...)
</em><br>
<p>My personal view is to use Eliezer's gender neutral pronouns for technical 
<br>
articles and discussion groups like this where it  clarifies and speeds 
<br>
debate but keep it out of lay articles where it would confuse and alienate 
<br>
the uninitiated.
