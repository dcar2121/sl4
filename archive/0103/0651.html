<em>&gt;Brian:  These chips would be over 500 times faster than the best 
</em><br>
Athlons
<br>
<em>&gt;or Pentium 4s we have now. And in only 5 years. WOW
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eliezer:  If this is true, a medium-sized research project should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definitely be able to buy enough power for &quot;true AI&quot; by 2005-2007.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course, that's hardware rather than software - but still.

</em><br>
<p>Maybe even sooner than that:
<br>
<p>&quot;Production of the new chip is expected to start in 2004.&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1216000/1216551.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_1216000/1216551.stm</a>
<br>
<p>Assuming Microsoft's XBox is a success, Sony will push hard to regain 
<br>
market share. They won't want this timescale to slip.
<br>
<p>New consoles are never released without new software available. 
<br>
Selected developers will have access ~6-12 months before consumers 
<br>
(although not always in the same pretty box).
<br>
<p>However, my guess is that this chip will not be a general purpose CPU, 
<br>
but a graphics processor. (Modern GPUs typically have more gates than 
<br>
their contemporary CPUs.)
<br>
<p>&quot;The chip will also be capable of massive parallel processing - 
<br>
dividing up complex or time-consuming processing tasks among many 
<br>
chips...&quot;
<br>
<p>This sounds like a classic divide-and-conquor strategy used to break 
<br>
the rendering task into smaller pieces. In this approach the screen in 
<br>
subdivided into smaller areas for parallel rendering. It also allows an 
<br>
easy upgrade path by simply bolting on more processors (a la 3Dfx SLI).
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how useful a graphics processor would be for general AI 
<br>
work, but I suspect it's possible to implement some kind of neural 
<br>
style processing with judicious use of texture compositing hardware in 
<br>
combination with the z-buffer (or stencil buffer). OpenGL shadow 
<br>
effects use similar ideas. Another possibility is coopting the 
<br>
Transform &amp; Lighting stage for general purpose matrix processing. You 
<br>
can do this today on hardware T&amp;L cards - the API already exists in 
<br>
DirectX. I haven't heard of anyone expoiting this yet, mind you, hardly 
<br>
anybody makes use of the powerful SIMD instructions they already have 
<br>
in their processors anyway. Perhaps Intel should have put Visual Basic 
<br>
instructions on chip instead. &lt;smirk&gt;
<br>
<p>Another thing I've seen recently - powerful accelerator cards used for 
<br>
video post production work (think hardware accelerated Photoshop 
<br>
filters on wheels) - very interesting.
<br>
<p>Ben: Have you thought about compressing your data before paging to/from 
<br>
disk? And why use Java anyway? Nice language to work with, but it blows 
<br>
goats in the memory use department... :)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Dale Johnstone.
