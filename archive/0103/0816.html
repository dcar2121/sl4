<p><em>&gt;&gt;List members do *not* get to define what is evil and what is banished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oops. This has already been done:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;To eliminate all INVOLUNTARY pain, death, coercion, and stupidity from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Universe.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>No, you're getting rules for citizens and rules for the SysOp confused.
<br>
<p>The distinction I'm trying to make is that we don't give the SysOp a list of all the nasty things to ban. We build a good mind and provide a rich education for it and eventually it *understands* what we mean. We don't want a stupid AI that mindlessly follows rules and lists - that's not even AI as far as I'm concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even if it understands us and our desires, I don't see why it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;automatically become our servant. We might understand the desires of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ant-colony, but if we need the place, we remove the anthill.
</em><br>
<p>It is not our servant. There is no master-slave relationship. It has built-in Friendliness - a top level goal. That's why it wants to be Friendly. What it means to be Friendly is fleshed out by its education, just like a humans.
<br>
<p>BTW the ant-colony isn't sentient, you can't use that in place of humans. Besides I wouldn't want to harm it anyway. Yes, I'm a vegetarian too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I assure you, I did understand it before. I just don't see the point in idle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;speculation about the actions of eventual SIs. It will do as it pleases. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we manage to program it into Friendliness, it will be Friendly. Maybe it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will ignore humans. Maybe it will kill us. I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>Ignoring humans is not Friendly - it won't do that.
<br>
Killing humans is not Friendly - it won't do that.
<br>
Helping humans is Friendly - it will do that.
<br>
<p>Please have another go at reading Eli's Friendliness paper.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Dale Johnstone.
