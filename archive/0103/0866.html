PREFACE:
<br>
<p>As for the &quot;v&quot; pronouns:
<br>
<p>Personally, I like &quot;ve/vim/ver/verself&quot;. I just do. From example, I 
<br>
assumed that &quot;ve&quot; was used for Transhuman beings and SI's. I enjoyed 
<br>
reading and using the new pronouns. I guess my immediate reaction 
<br>
was that I like the distinction this creates, of being something
<br>
more than the usual human. That was my initial gut reaction and I
<br>
guess it just stuck.
<br>
<p>I don't have a strong opinion about this, just a couple observations:
<br>
<p>Consider:
<br>
<p>The degree to which individuals like to diverge from routine 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ie. standard English)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's sort fun, in a game like way to use &quot;verself&quot; and also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has more serious subtext (cf. Alicia's et al.'s posts).
<br>
<p>A secret language has &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them&quot; tribal significance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(can you tell I'm reading &quot;The Origins of Virtue&quot;),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which, as people pointed out, has positive and negative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results in a publically minded webpage like FAI.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the real question is whether people find the distinction 
<br>
large enough to warrant the effort. It seems there is a multiplicity 
<br>
of opinion on that. Survey says: Standoff.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; From: &quot;gabriel C&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:drachyneyes@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20AYBAM%20WAS:%20Gender%20Neutral%20Pronouns">drachyneyes@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How about we drop the public use of gender-neutrals, and give the AI a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gender neutral name?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E.G. &quot;AYBAM&quot;  (all your base are mine)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's gender neutral, and an inside joke as well.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not much into giving the AI a name. It'd be cooler if ve chose
<br>
ver own (IMO). But there's another way Singularitarians(?) might co-opt 
<br>
the acronym AYBAM. 
<br>
<p>When I was in college, I overheard several people on my dormitory
<br>
floor debating something (probably of little consequence). When one
<br>
person made a statement that the other did not believe, the
<br>
disbeliever exclaimed &quot;Oh look, a monkey!&quot; and everyone laughed. I had
<br>
no idea what this meant. Later I asked the disbeliever for the origin
<br>
and meaning of the saying. He (or she, I can't remember which ;-) told
<br>
me that on Saturday Night Live, a common expression was currently in
<br>
overuse: &quot;Yeah, and maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt&quot; which was
<br>
typically uttered right after saying something totally unbelievable. 
<br>
This little phrase was shortened to &quot;Oh look, (significant pause) a 
<br>
monkey!&quot; and was now used to challenge something another person was 
<br>
saying. The new phrase became a humorous short hand for a (slightly) 
<br>
more complicated statement, and was easily recognized by most people 
<br>
on my hall.
<br>
<p>So now, consider several people, perhaps Ahmish, perhaps not, who have
<br>
never encountered the idea of the Singularity and have no clue of its
<br>
imminent appearance. We can now introduce a phrase that describes
<br>
their eventual experience (NOTE: these might be mythical people, since
<br>
word of the Singularity might spread everywhere fast enough, but the
<br>
scenario might be interesting...perhaps it's one we need to avoid):
<br>
<p><p>&lt;Singularity approaches, people stare up at it and point&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;Look, up in the sky!&quot;
<br>
&quot;It's a bird!&quot;
<br>
&quot;It's a plane!&quot;
<br>
&quot;It's ...&quot;
<br>
&quot;Ay!&quot; Bam!
<br>
