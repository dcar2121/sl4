In response to Dale Johnstone:
<br>
<p>For starters, if some of my arguments can be rebutted by referring to 
<br>
&quot;Friendly AI&quot;, please point to specific chapters/sections. My easter holiday 
<br>
is on the horizon, but until then I don't have time to read the paper. I do 
<br>
not really feel as I have enough background information for a totally 
<br>
informed discussion, but I think it is a bit rude to just say: &quot;I will not 
<br>
talk to you&quot;. So here goes:

<em>&gt; &gt;Even if it understands us and our desires, I don't see why it would

<em>&gt; &gt;automatically become our servant. We might understand the desires of an
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is not our servant. There is no master-slave relationship. It has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;built-in Friendliness - a top level goal.
</em><br>
<p>My point is, this goal might be replaced during the AI:s self-modification. 
<br>
I have seen some &quot;failure of friendliness&quot; scenarios in FAI, but I haven't 
<br>
found one that addresses this. If you have, please point to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That's why it wants to be Friendly. What it means to be Friendly is fleshed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out by its education, just like a humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;BTW the ant-colony isn't sentient, you can't use that in place of humans.
</em><br>
<p>Why not? The argument wasn't about sentience. If the AI turns out to be 
<br>
selfish, it might not care if we are sentient or not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Besides I wouldn't want to harm it anyway. Yes, I'm a vegetarian too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I assure you, I did understand it before. I just don't see the point in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;speculation about the actions of eventual SIs. It will do as it pleases. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we manage to program it into Friendliness, it will be Friendly. Maybe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will ignore humans. Maybe it will kill us. I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ignoring humans is not Friendly - it won't do that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Killing humans is not Friendly - it won't do that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Helping humans is Friendly - it will do that.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I should have been clearer: If we manage to program it into 
<br>
Friendliness, it will be Friendly. Then it would help humans.
<br>
If it turns out that our programming didn't make it Friendly, then it could 
<br>
do the things stated above.
<br>
Everyone seem certain that the Friendliness programming will succeed. I feel 
<br>
that this is quite uncertain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Please have another go at reading Eli's Friendliness paper.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I will. If I have made arguments that have been made a million times 
<br>
before, and duly rebutted, please let me know. I will then stop posting on 
<br>
Friendliness issues until I have read FAI. That would also give me time to 
<br>
make some posts about the years leading up to the Singularity.
