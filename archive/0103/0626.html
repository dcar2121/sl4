<p>
I've spent the last four months in Tucson, Arizona, 
<br>
home to the (in)famous theory that consciousness
<br>
resides in the quantum states of neural microtubules. 
<br>
For those who haven't heard of this theory, it has
<br>
several parts: 
<br>
<p>1) that there are macroscopic quantum states in
<br>
the brain, used for biological quantum computation
<br>
<p>2) that there are not &quot;many worlds&quot;, in the sense
<br>
of Everett, but rather that wavefunctions are
<br>
&quot;objectively reduced&quot; by a natural process which is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2a) quantum-gravitational
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2b) noncomputable (in the Turing sense)
<br>
<p>3) that the noncomputable part of this process
<br>
implements the human ability to perform Goedelian
<br>
reasoning, which &quot;jumps out of the system&quot; in
<br>
order to relate mathematical and metamathematical
<br>
facts
<br>
<p>The microtubules (which are cylindrical structures
<br>
running throughout the cytoplasm, outside the
<br>
cell nucleus) are the putative site of the
<br>
relevant quantum states. 
<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel has seen me give a talk about this; 
<br>
you can see the notes for that and a more recent
<br>
talk at <a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mjporter">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~mjporter</a>
<br>
<p>What does this have to do with the Singularity? 
<br>
It's not just that Grover's quantum search algorithm
<br>
is exponentially faster than classical search, so
<br>
Powers will probably use quantum computers, or
<br>
anything so simple. 
<br>
<p>In my opinion, quantum theories of the brain, 
<br>
should they be borne out, will be the prelude
<br>
to a new philosophy of mind in which the nature
<br>
of cognition will be seen to be dependent on
<br>
the physical implementation. Perhaps something
<br>
like &quot;conscious experience = quantum information, 
<br>
reflective thought = trans-Turing quantum
<br>
computation&quot;, although that's just a guess. 
<br>
And the difference between cognition and
<br>
computation is that *cognition* requires computations
<br>
involving quantum states which intrinsically
<br>
have a particular content, whereas 'ordinary'
<br>
computation involves virtual machines (from the
<br>
point-of-view of fundamental physics - that is, 
<br>
computational states are big fuzzy classes of
<br>
physical micro-states, not 'fundamental' states)
<br>
whose states have semantic content only by
<br>
user stipulation or causal correlation. 
<br>
<p>Again, what does this have to do with the Singularity?
<br>
<p>Current expositions of the Singularity, and of
<br>
related concepts like Friendly AI and seed AI, 
<br>
assume a strong-AI philosophy of mind, at least
<br>
when it comes to the AIs themselves. Eliezer makes
<br>
remarks about noncomputability occasionally, but
<br>
he still attributes cognitive states to the AIs, 
<br>
and hopes that *they* will solve the philosophical
<br>
problems. I don't think we can take this for granted. 
<br>
So a priority for me is to see what concepts like
<br>
seed AI, self-enhancement, and Friendly AI would
<br>
look like given the philosophy of mind sketched
<br>
in the last paragraph. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I can't tell you yet, because 
<br>
quantum computing is still in the very early stages
<br>
of recapitulating the development of classical
<br>
computer science, and AI builds on cognitive science
<br>
which builds on relatively advanced concepts from
<br>
computer science. And I should add that I don't
<br>
think that 'quantum computer science' per se is
<br>
a sufficient foundation; I think that a far more
<br>
likely foundation is the (obscure to most members
<br>
of this list, I'm sure) philosophy of
<br>
&quot;transcendental phenomenology&quot;, coupled to a
<br>
fundamental theory like M theory. If I'm right, 
<br>
to *really* know what we're doing we would need 
<br>
to reconstruct the concepts of AI and seed AI in
<br>
terms of this new foundation; and we certainly
<br>
don't know that a classical AI has the ability
<br>
to discover and formulate that new foundation
<br>
all by itself.
