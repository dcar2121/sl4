<p>
Two comments here.
<br>
<p>First, people have now begun complaining about the recent shift in
<br>
discussion material, including at least one person who said that, if he
<br>
wanted to hear about this, he'd find a list devoted to it.
<br>
<p>There is, therefore, too much traffic now devoted to religious matters. 
<br>
Please make fewer posts.  Do not reply unless you have something new and
<br>
original to say.  Ideally, don't discuss it all.  If this admonition
<br>
doesn't produce higher-quality discussion, I'll try a one-week ban.  If
<br>
that doesn't work, the ban will become permament.
<br>
<p>Second, the fact that YOU have failed to read up on the subject does not
<br>
make ME a religious nut.  In particular, the standard current working
<br>
definition of evil is &quot;Involuntary death, pain, coercion, and stupidity.&quot; 
<br>
(Those who choose may emphasize &quot;involuntary&quot;; personally I'd emphasize
<br>
&quot;stupidity&quot;.)  The question of supergoal content is also discussed, here
<br>
and there, in the interim version of &quot;Friendly AI&quot; released to the list. 
<br>
Please note the following quote:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Punting the issue of &quot;What is 'good'?&quot; back to individual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentients enormously simplifies a lot of moral issues;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether life is better than death, for example.  Nobody
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be able to interfere if a sentient chooses life.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And - in all probability - nobody should be able to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interfere if a sentient chooses death.  So what's left to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argue about? 
<br>
<p>The usual rule is that, if you have an opinion, post that opinion
<br>
forthrightly.  However, to suppose that the entire Board of Directors of
<br>
the Singularity Institute plus the list membership of SL4 has never once
<br>
thought &quot;Gee, how can I define evil?&quot; borders on the insulting.
<br>
<p>If you are ever in doubt as to whether a standard answer exists for
<br>
something, then, for crying out loud, WRITE TO ME AND ASK BEFORE YOU POST!
<br>
