Greetings
<br>
<p>Figured I'd get around to introducing myself after a period of lurking.
<br>
Actually, I've been meaning to do that for some time, but it always got
<br>
delayed. Just as well, since this message is hardly a matter of life and
<br>
death, just some simple courtesy on my part. Expect me to mostly just
<br>
continue my lurking.
<br>
<p>I'm currently both an undergraduate student and a teacher in the
<br>
department of computer science of the university of Helsinki. My plans
<br>
for the immediate future include graduation and getting myself involved
<br>
in certain research projects here, hopefully not in that order since I'd
<br>
like to get my hands dirty a bit sooner (besides, a suitable research
<br>
project could make nice thesis material). On the longer term things get
<br>
a little fuzzier, but I can't see myself going for much anything else
<br>
than an academic career path or something rather close to one.
<br>
<p>I got introduced to the singularity last fall by stumbling on Eliezer's
<br>
web pages. After reading some of the texts in the Low Beyond and some
<br>
other places, things seemed to click together rather nicely. Actually,
<br>
I'd half expected somewhat more future shock from the site judging by
<br>
the comments of the person who referred me to the pages. I've probably
<br>
been too open-minded a fan of speculative fiction for too long a time
<br>
(not to mention being a writer wannabe, but let's not get into that).
<br>
<p>Incidentally, a while after doing my reading, when I'd managed to
<br>
process and analyze certain motivational problems, I switched the focus
<br>
of my studies here to intelligent systems. The field has intrigued me
<br>
for many years, but I hadn't bothered to get really into it. Call it
<br>
lazyness on my part, specializing in distributed systems seemed an
<br>
easier choice - actually, it still seems that, but it also seems now
<br>
that there are some more worthwhile fields to play in.
<br>
<p>I haven't yet made any comments on the discussions on the list, partly
<br>
because most times views closely enough resembling mine do surface
<br>
anyway without me having to come out and express them. I also have a
<br>
general tendency not to be very sociable nor to make a big fuss about my
<br>
views around strangers. I do semi-frequently indulge in boredom-induced
<br>
idle online conversations (sometimes of SL4 matters) that do have some
<br>
of that element in them, though. Also, you can't help becoming very
<br>
aware of some of my opinions on technical matters in areas that I have
<br>
some expertise in if you actually work with me. I can be rather
<br>
insistent when I know I'm right, though I'd at least like to think I'm
<br>
not completely without flexibility nor the ability to recognize my blind
<br>
spots.
<br>
<p>So, that's it, I suppose. Keep up the conversation. Perhaps sometime I
<br>
might even be provoked into commenting on something. With any luck, it
<br>
might even be something intelligent.
