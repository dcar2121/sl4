</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, my question lies in the involuntary stupidity.  How do you define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?
</em><br>
<p>First, I answer in my capacity as a wetware sim of a Friendly AI:
<br>
<p>&quot;The key word is INVOLUNTARY.  This very easily lets me solve the problem
<br>
by punting it back to individual sentients.  The individual defines
<br>
&quot;pain&quot;.  The individual defines &quot;stupidity&quot;.  In general, if there's not
<br>
an objective or very strongly convergent answer, I just punt the question
<br>
back to the citizen.&quot;
<br>
<p>Next, I answer in my capacity as a human altruist:
<br>
<p>&quot;I get to define evil however I like.  In fact, from my perspective, the
<br>
evil of stupidity has nothing to do with whether it's voluntary or
<br>
involuntary.  For me, the attraction of the Sysop Scenario is my belief
<br>
that the vast majority of people will choose not to be stupid.  Thus, by
<br>
constructing a Friendly AI that fulfills people's volitions, I will have
<br>
initiated a causal chain that ends in the elimination of what I define as
<br>
tremendous evil, and in the creation of what I define as tremendous good. 
<br>
That's what makes the Singularity a good thing.  It doesn't mean that my
<br>
definitions are contaminating supergoal content.&quot;
<br>
<p>Next, I answer in my capacity as a Friendship programmer:
<br>
<p>&quot;Individual volition is only one view, philosophically, of the
<br>
be-all-and-end-all of morality.  The general principle that Friendly AIs
<br>
should be able to handle anything a human altruist can handle means that a
<br>
Friendly AI may need to value life, truth, joy, freedom, et cetera, in
<br>
addition to valuing volition.  In the event that volition does come out on
<br>
top, which is what I expect, then the valuation of such subsidiary goals
<br>
would be expressed in interactions with any given individual to the extent
<br>
that that individual wanted the Sysop to express them.  In other words,
<br>
each citizen would get to decide how much moral personality their facet of
<br>
the Sysop would appear to have.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly.  The only thing that worries me about the future, is this point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right here.  That human individuals are going to try and influence rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-SI so that it becomes their personal concept of utopia.  I would hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Powers are inherently friendly in virtually all cases by nature.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that was my working model from 1996 to 2000.  During 2000 I started
<br>
switching from &quot;objective morality&quot; to &quot;Friendly AI&quot;.  Note that both
<br>
models are very strongly programmer-independent.
<br>
<p>Compare
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/logic.ext.html">http://sysopmind.com/tmol-faq/logic.ext.html</a>     (objective morality)
<br>
vs.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/CaTAI/friendly/require.html">http://intelligence.org/CaTAI/friendly/require.html</a>  (Friendliness)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any case I thought that the idea of us providing rules for the other side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been totally, and completely proven a terrible idea.  For example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing Asimov Laws was said to be a horrible idea because it is impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to determine exactly what they would become after thousands, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of upgrades.  Does that not equally apply to &quot;friendliness&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>This, again, was exactly what I would have said back when I conceived of
<br>
Asimov Laws as being intrinsically opposed to objective morality - a set
<br>
of artificial rules that prevents the system from following vis own
<br>
course.  What pried me loose of the no-Friendliness-needed model in the
<br>
first place was the possibility that the objective morality would be
<br>
built, rather than discovered - in which case, the AI would need to know
<br>
what to build.
<br>
<p>Asimov Laws are inherently ugly and coercive.  I've always believed that
<br>
and I probably always will.  Coming up with a replacement theory for
<br>
objective morality that was *equally* *beautiful* was the challenge.  I do
<br>
believe that, in _Friendly AI_, I have succeeded; there is still no
<br>
coercion involved.  It's just that the ideal of &quot;no sensitivity to initial
<br>
conditions&quot; has been replaced by the still broader ideal that a Friendly
<br>
AI should be able to handle at least all moral and philosophical problems
<br>
that can be handled by humans, including either the presence or absence of
<br>
objective morality.  Since humans themselves innately dislike sensitivity
<br>
to initial conditions in moral philosophies, the new (nonugly) theory is
<br>
actually a more powerful generalization of the previous (nonugly) theory. 
<br>
Friendliness creates the path of an AI; it doesn't oppose an existing
<br>
path.  If you are ever, at any point, *afraid* that the AI will see some
<br>
truth or gain some aspect of intelligence, then you are working against
<br>
the AI, rather than with ver, and you have departed the path of
<br>
Friendliness.
