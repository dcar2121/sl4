<p>
In the UFSI vs. FSI debate, I think some of this territory has
<br>
been covered in the &quot;When Subgoals Attack&quot; thread (insert link
<br>
to archive here). 
<br>
<p>The UFSI can only arrive from one of two places:
<br>
<p>1) Internally (that is, from the matter controlled by the Sysop)
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p>2) Externally (from somewhere outside the solar system, galaxy, etc). 
<br>
<p>Well ok, there is the possibility that it arrives from both, (eg. it
<br>
can start externally and transmit trojan horse memes into our Sysop).
<br>
<p>If the SI arises internally, it will be a sub-goal, in the sense that
<br>
every computation must comply with Friendliness, and is therefore a
<br>
suggoal. When you order your nano brewed Earl Gray Iced tea with a
<br>
lemon twist, (shaken, not stirred), this command will be a sub-sub-...
<br>
-subgoal of Friendliness (See WSA for discussions of efficiency). 
<br>
<p>Also, remember, the Sysop SI is *exponentially* smarter and
<br>
knowledgeable than all other processes. Ve will spend a lot of ver
<br>
resources (assumedly an optimal amount) to predicting and pattern
<br>
matching the most likely means of an emergence of a UFSI from a
<br>
subgoal. In fact, I'd assume that an effective Sysop will create all
<br>
sorts of traps to snare a UFSI as early as possible.  You can read the
<br>
WSA thread to see if you agree this is possible (Eliezer convinced me
<br>
anyway).
<br>
<p>I envision the Sysop to be made of holons and holarchies of goals (I
<br>
ought to link to a web page describing these). Individual SI's are all
<br>
subgoals in my mind and the boundaries exist only when it makes
<br>
sense to draw them. Interesting subject of speculation, anyway. These
<br>
multiple SI's are all team-players, they've been scanned and are
<br>
constantly updated to ever-align with Friendliness. You can think of
<br>
them as one, you can think of them as many. Your choice. 
<br>
<p>So as for #2, as in External UFSI's (EUFSI, I see your UFSI and raise
<br>
you an &quot;E&quot;), I'm not sure. There seem to be three possible
<br>
relationships of the intellectual capabilities:
<br>
<p>1) Sysop &gt; EUFSI
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sysop wins temporarily
<br>
<p>2) Sysop ~= EUFSI
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw
<br>
<p>3) Sysop &lt; EUFSI
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sysop loses
<br>
<p>Can we reasonably speculate on the likelihood of these three? I'd be
<br>
interested to hear what people think. Are there EUFSI's and FSI's out
<br>
there? Could our Sysop defend vimself against a smarter EUFSI? I'd say
<br>
no, almost by definition. So if our Sysop is dedicated to self
<br>
preservation, it seems reasonable to me, that ve will constantly be
<br>
trying to get more resources for computronium and also trying to
<br>
improve the efficiency of current computronium stores. The only reason
<br>
ve wouldn't, is if the likely existence of EUFSI's is extremely low
<br>
and doesn't warrant the work. Of course a EUFSI would like you to
<br>
think that, wouldn't it ;)
