OK, you had a definition for &quot;ending all evil&quot;. My mistake. I had scooped 
<br>
around Eleziers website without finding anything.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;To eliminate all INVOLUNTARY pain, death, coercion, and stupidity from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Universe.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Any problems?
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, the problems remain. While &quot;death&quot; can be clearly defined, &quot;pain&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;coercion&quot; cannot. Have you got separate definitions for these too? Is it 
<br>
only physical pain or also psychological? Can I be bullied all my life in 
<br>
school and when I put the gun in my mouth to end my misery, the gun clicks? 
<br>
Or wait, is that voluntary death? Or have my tormentors used coercion to get 
<br>
me killed?
<br>
<p>All interaction between humans includes various degrees of coercion; from 
<br>
suggestion to persuation to brute force. Where do you draw the line?
<br>
<p>My original question was meant as a retorical one. The point is, with a 
<br>
subjective definition of &quot;evil&quot;, there cannot be a uniform set of rules that 
<br>
will &quot;end all evil&quot; as defined here.
<br>
<p>I fail to see the need for discussing concepts like good, evil, morality or 
<br>
ethics at all, or how a Power/SI would relate to them. Ethics seem to be 
<br>
little more than rules set up by humans in order to maintain a fairly stable 
<br>
society. I don't see how that can have any meaning in the post-Singularity 
<br>
world or even in the last years leading up to the Singularity. I admit that 
<br>
I haven't read Eleziers &quot;friendly AI&quot;-paper (is it out yet?), but right now, 
<br>
I can see no way to determine how an AI would react towards humans. If 
<br>
anything, the most logical thing would probably be either extermination, or 
<br>
forced uploading (Best use of material resources). But personally, I would 
<br>
rather avoid speculation about post-singularity issues completely.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;The scary thing about that is, who gets to define what constitutes &quot;evil?&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Someone has to do it.
</em><br>
<p>No, noone has to do it. All we have to do is build a seed AI (unless we are 
<br>
talking about Asimov Laws...).
<br>
<p><p>/Christian
