</em><br>
<p>It's a historical simulation of Transition celebrity Eliezer Yudkowsky, of
<br>
course.  A lot of post-Singularity still-human individuals ran it, more so
<br>
as Eliezer is one of the few (historical) personalities that can be run in
<br>
a totally immersive, non-knowing simulation without violating citizenship
<br>
rights... though it does have a certain effect on your personality...
<br>
<p>Not that *I'm* volunteering, but I can easily see myself reaching that
<br>
conclusion (even pre-Singularity), and that might be enough under the
<br>
rules.
<br>
<p>You can watch the 24-hour Buffy channel; you can live in an immersive
<br>
Buffyverse Matrix filled with totally realistic personalities for all
<br>
other sentients; you can adopt a Buffy outlook and personality; you can
<br>
assimilate Buffy's historical memories (as revealed by Joss Whedon); you
<br>
can shove your memories of the real world into the back of your mind; you
<br>
can damp down the cognitive processes whereby your knowledge of the
<br>
unreality of your world interferes with the emotional impact - but you
<br>
still need enough memory of the external world to give your continuous
<br>
informed consent, because a pure vanilla Buffy wouldn't consent to being
<br>
stuck in her horrible world... or choose to load your &quot;real&quot; memories back
<br>
in after leaving it.
<br>
<p>You can only undergo a totally unknowing sim experience if the sim
<br>
personality is such as to (a) consent and (b) be willing to load your true
<br>
memories back in afterwards.  So it's more than usually plausible that
<br>
*I'm* a simulation, not just because of my potential celebrity, but
<br>
because Eliezer Yudkowsky is one of the few historical personalities who
<br>
might be willing to do that - exist and hurt and be effectively
<br>
annihilated at the end - *if* there were a really strong reason, something
<br>
to be gained under my/his morality; because right now, at least, I assign
<br>
my own life the same value I would assign anyone else's, and I'd need a
<br>
good reason before I'd allow myself to be hurt.  In the apparent/original
<br>
world, the Singularity can take precedence over my welfare; in a world
<br>
where there's no Singularity to be gained, I/he/we would need a pretty
<br>
good reason to consent to the recreation of negative experiences, even if
<br>
it's consent-in-potentia.
<br>
<p>But again, in that case, all you guys out there are zombies, and I'm
<br>
writing this email because it was in the historical record - so why dwell
<br>
on it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you even know or enforce what someone else does with their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computronium?
</em><br>
<p>You own and control your own computronium, but you control it through the
<br>
Sysop API, and trying to violate citizenship rights will result in an API
<br>
error.  If we're in a sim with no citizenship rights, then we are so
<br>
totally, utterly screwed that there is really very little that I can think
<br>
of to do about it.
