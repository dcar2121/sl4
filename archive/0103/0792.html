<p>BS.  If you don't know the difference between an intellectual argument
<br>
for an action and being physically forced to take an action then I am
<br>
afraid I can't help you.  The line is drawn at forcing an entity to take
<br>
an action whether it chooses to or not.  This includes threatening to
<br>
kill or harm the entity if it does not take the action.  Now the
<br>
&quot;physical&quot; bit is a tricker if we are all in upload land.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My original question was meant as a retorical one. The point is, with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective definition of &quot;evil&quot;, there cannot be a uniform set of rules that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will &quot;end all evil&quot; as defined here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I fail to see the need for discussing concepts like good, evil, morality or
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This seems like a very limited and inhuman[e] view.  If there is no
<br>
ethics then there are no guiding principles to your actions, no
<br>
abstraction of what is truly in your self-interest longterm or not and
<br>
every decision governing whether to take an action is utterly
<br>
seat-of-the-pants at that moment.  You also cannot depend on any context
<br>
for the actions of others as they will make their own seat-of-the-pants
<br>
(pls excuse physical metaphors) decisions moment by moment.  There can
<br>
be no level of trust.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Ethics seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more than rules set up by humans in order to maintain a fairly stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society. I don't see how that can have any meaning in the post-Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world or even in the last years leading up to the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>What, the need goes away for stable associations of entities?  How so? 
<br>
The need for stable associations and for governing primary ethical
<br>
principle if anything increases as the entities get more powerful and
<br>
capable of greater harm and as the interactions and activities get
<br>
orders of magnitude more complex.
