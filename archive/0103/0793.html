&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regarding the recent discussion of fsi/ufsi warfare ... (i'm about
<br>
200 messages behind in my inbox).

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friendly in the context of the si goal system is merely a
<br>
label for something vastly more complex than a human concept. violence is
<br>
an anthropomorphic term. i guess we can attribute violence to si warfare
<br>
to the extent that when intoxicated, we might attribute cruelty to the
<br>
laws of physics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find this very hard to believe.  If nothing else, the Friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SI would be limited in its actions (collateral damage, avoid excessively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devastating attacks, etc).  In a perfectly even match the individual with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the least restrictions usually wins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hmmm ... the fsi's super-goal is something like &quot;protect human
<br>
beings&quot; ... while the ufsi's super-goal, in the very worst case, would be
<br>
&quot;destroy human beings&quot; ... seems like a pretty symmetrical situation to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of course, there might be a slight symmetry-breaking since human
<br>
beings are to a certain extent self-destructive ... or at least easily
<br>
perishable. however, to what extent this is significant to an si, is open
<br>
to speculation. moreover, it is pretty unlikely that the fsi and the ufsi
<br>
are going to be so closely matched at all. either the creation of the fsi
<br>
precedes that of the ufsi, in which case the fsi has a head start in an
<br>
exponential growth race, or the ufsi is not of human origin, in which case
<br>
all bets are off. in fact, my current understanding of si ecology suggests
<br>
that interstellar migration would incur severe costs for a mature si.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And if the Friendly AI is capable of all this, I'm not so sure how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly friendly it would actually be itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finally, the sysop isn't a human being. it doesn't have to suffer
<br>
from cognitive dissonance to the point of catatonic shock. we're not
<br>
talking about something as brittle as asimov's laws here. we can be pretty
<br>
sure that any mistake obvious to a human (such as sitting down and cry;
<br>
trying to save everyone but saving no one; etc.) will not be made. as to
<br>
what the actual stategy will be, a) it will depend on the situation, and
<br>
in any case b) it is probably beyond my meager alotment of intelligence.
<br>
my speculation: if it really comes down to it, some way of trading off one
<br>
sentience against another (or one aspect of it against another) probably
<br>
have to be made. if we retain the (imho naive) notion that all sentiences
<br>
are absolutely equal, then the default selection semantics might be
<br>
random.
