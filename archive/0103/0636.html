Re: Vinge's discussion of bacteria
<br>
<p>If you like that stuff I recommend &quot;A Walk Through Time&quot; (1998) which
<br>
chronicles the history of life on Earth. It is a very accessible book
<br>
based on a museum exhibit in which each foot represents a million
<br>
years of history (might be too simplistic for this audience though.
<br>
See Margulis for more in depth coverage - John Smart mentioned one
<br>
of her books). 
<br>
<p>&quot;A Walk Through Time&quot; chronicles the billions of years that bacteria 
<br>
dominate(d) our planet. I thought I'd mention two snippets from the 
<br>
book that seem very interesting, (since I didn't know them before):
<br>
<p><p>1) Cellular Cities! 
<br>
<p>It is only recently that new techniques in microscopy (confocal
<br>
scanning laser microscopy) have allowed us to see cellular cities
<br>
(aka biofilms, mucilages). 
<br>
<p>&quot;The cities are laced with intricate channels connecting the buldings
<br>
to circulate water, nutrients, enzymes, oxygen, and recyclable
<br>
wastes. Their diverse inhabitants live in different microneighborhoods
<br>
and glide, motor, or swim along roadways and canals.&quot; (p. 67)
<br>
<p>Researchers cited: Microbiologist Bill Keevil (England),
<br>
Microbiologist Bill Costerton (US, Montana)
<br>
<p>Also of note is that these bacteria turn on different sets of genes
<br>
than their identical counterparts. All bacteria give off small
<br>
amounts of homoserine lactone, and when enough of them get together,
<br>
concentrated amounts of h.l. turn them into city dwellers!
<br>
<p>There was some speculation elsewhere in the book that bacteria might
<br>
have evolved viruses to pass information around. It all depends on how 
<br>
you look at things, I guess.
<br>
<p><p>2) Cells have skeletons! 
<br>
<p>&quot;Until recently, we did not even know that such cell skeletons --
<br>
cytoskeletons -- exist, because the chemicals with which we prepared
<br>
cells for study dissolved them. We had assumed cells to be floppy
<br>
bags of organelles and a nucleus floating around in liquid cytoplasm&quot;
<br>
(p. 84) - D'oh!
<br>
<p>Researchers cited: Donald Ingber (Harvard / MIT) shows these
<br>
cytoskeletons to be &quot;tensegrity structures&quot; a la Buckminster Fuller
<br>
(imagine rigid straws connected with elastic to form flexible
<br>
geodesic domes that bend at the joints). So cool!
