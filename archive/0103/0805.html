<em>&gt; &gt; b) R causes T. Some philosophers and historians, for example, argued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that religion has influenced philosophy which in turn created modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; science (back in the early Enlightenment) which in turn created modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology.  Religious aspirations to become more than human have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; piggybacked along the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not enough for a bunch of theologians to try and take credit for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science; there has to be transmission of false or undesirable information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from religion to science.  Don't postulate; demonstrate; point out a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific example.
</em><br>
<p>I recently read an article on this issue which I thought to be interesting:
<br>
<a href="http://www.reciprocality.org/Reciprocality/r6/design.html">http://www.reciprocality.org/Reciprocality/r6/design.html</a> - Half way down,
<br>
'Religion Design 101'
<br>
<p>The author's perspective is that humanity is suffering from a mimetic
<br>
disease that replaces much conscious thought with rules of thumb and ritual,
<br>
and that religions were created by gifted immunes as a long term cure.  The
<br>
healthy payloads listed are:
<br>
<p>Christianity - Individual recognisance and considering the merits of
<br>
individual cases.
<br>
<p>Islam - The physical world is the creation of Allah, and should be studied
<br>
with reverence and diligence.
<br>
<p>Buddhism - Concepts of circular causality and the internal self-consistency
<br>
of the universe.
<br>
<p>A shame they weren't all together in one faith.
