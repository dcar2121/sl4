</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no such difficulty when writing about AIs.  Because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, they _do not have a gender_.  Therefore, we can use 'it'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer claims that using &quot;it&quot; gets to be too difficult and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusing, but I strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree.  If anyone can come up with an example of a thought
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Otherwise, let's kill this monstrosity right here and now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having a special (and _pointless_, mind you) set of pronouns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really doesn't help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I find this entirely correct, even if a bit harsh on Eli, who is simply
<br>
trying to move beyond sexism in a structured way in his writing.
<br>
<p>But the real point is, we are already rapidly moving beyond sex having
<br>
future-relevance. You don't mention someone's race when it doesn't matter,
<br>
and likewise, you don't mention their gender pronouns, unless it does matter
<br>
in your sentence, which is rarely these days. Virtually everyone who knows
<br>
this simply uses it/itself, or moves beyond the pronouns. Those who have
<br>
tried special grammars have all faded, as that goes the wrong direction.
<br>
&quot;It&quot; is already gender neutral, and perfect. Like some, I used to simply use
<br>
&quot;herself&quot; since his has had far too much exposure, but in recent years I've
<br>
come to see &quot;it&quot; takes away the issue much better. When someone questions my
<br>
grammar I gently reeducation that it is appropriately sexless, as are many
<br>
important things these days.
<br>
<p>Sex was a useful concept for creating biological complexity, but it is clear
<br>
we will be moving beyond sex. Even today we see people changing sex at will
<br>
(sometimes back and forth) or calling themselves &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;neutered&quot; :)
<br>
instead of male and female on forms. We're all striving for sexual equality.
<br>
Having a special set of pronouns does unfortunately make everything you
<br>
write look quite &quot;kookish,&quot; even though it is excellently motivated. It
<br>
detracts from your perceived wisdom unecessarily. I hope you'll take Wales
<br>
and my comments to heart, or do a survey or something, brother. Man. Hombre.
<br>
Sister. Girl. Chick. uh, partner. Friend. :)
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
