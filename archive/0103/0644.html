<p>
First, let me say that my point here is not to defend in great detail the
<br>
specific concept(s) of how there can be military applications of AI that
<br>
go beyond off-the-field tactical support.  My ultimate point is only that
<br>
it is not hard to see how making battlefield tools more intelligent can be
<br>
extremely useful, so that we recognize that there will be military demand
<br>
for increasingly intelligent hardware all the way up to human-level AI.
<br>
<p>I'm not offering an opinion about whether this is a good thing or a
<br>
bad thing.  In some ways, it is surely a good thing.  I think that
<br>
most people were glad -- no matter what their position on the Gulf War
<br>
-- that we increasingly have the ability to pinpoint military targets
<br>
and leave innocent civilians alone.  But of course, it can be a bad
<br>
thing if the existence of superior weapons somehow increases the
<br>
liklihood of violence and war in general.

<p>Of course you are right about this.  This is what makes forecasting difficult;
<br>
however it does not argue against military applications in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't understand the actual limits on military hardware.  In the real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, hardware is largely limited by physical/mechanical limits rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than computational limits.  The most advanced, fastest systems produced by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. today (i.e. systems that are still in the testing stage) in terms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of real-time multiple target discrimination and evaluation typically have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MIPS R2000/R3000 or Motorola 68K as their central 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processors.  Why?  Because, these &quot;old/slow&quot; chips have more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient computational power for even the most advanced real-time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military applications.
</em><br>
<p>If you believe this, then you aren't thinking creatively enough about what the
<br>
&quot;most advanced real-time military applications&quot; might be.  :-)
<br>
<p>Imagine the situation on the ground in Mogadishu, Somalia, during our
<br>
conflict there.  Soldiers were fighting in the streets against poorly
<br>
trained but well-armed guerillas who were perfectly willing to hide in
<br>
crowds of women and children.  Now imagine a machine gun that could
<br>
discriminate -- as well as a human being, but 1000 times faster and
<br>
without emotion -- between a woman with a baby and a man with a AK-47.
<br>
The gun could do this in _automatic_ mode, making it much easier for a
<br>
soldier to fire &quot;randomly&quot; into a crowd while hitting (more or less)
<br>
only hostiles and not innocent bystanders.
<br>
<p>That's an example of an application of intelligent machinery that is
<br>
not at all far fetched given current trends.
<br>
<p>And it is clearly desirable, for political and military reasons.
<br>
<p>Your objections to this type of system are well-noted.  Certainly, an intelligent
<br>
gun could make the same kinds of mistakes that a human could make -- and some other
<br>
kinds of mistakes besides.  And a gun of this type would *not* be used in full-auto
<br>
all the time.
<br>
<p>But just imagine -- if this capability could be built-in for only
<br>
$1000, wouldn't we add it?  For $100?  For $10? It gives an enormous
<br>
amount of flexibility to the soldier on the ground, even if it is
<br>
imperfect.
<br>
<p>If you still don't like the smart gun concept, then consider some
<br>
others -- I'm sure you can think of some more on your own.  :-)
