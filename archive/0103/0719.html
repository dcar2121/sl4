&nbsp;&nbsp;Well,I certainly started off on a bad foot!As you said,perhaps this subject
<br>
has been discussed to death before I arrived,if so,sorry.One of the things
<br>
that I enjoy in reading these posts are the sincere attempts to tackle the
<br>
bigger philosophical and ethical issues brought to light by the
<br>
Singularity.The only reason that I even posted my limited musings was due to
<br>
something in your previous post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Transhuman means transhumanly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuasive... a superintelligence could simply take over a human mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given realtime bandwidth, maybe even take over a mind using a memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proxy (ultra-appealing religions, say).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I was just pointing towards the fact that just such a thing might have
<br>
already happened,or might be occuring even now.And to reply in kind to your
<br>
reply:
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Stories are just stories.  They don't matter one way or the other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I'm missing your point,but I was frankly shocked to see someone as
<br>
obviously brilliant as yourself make such a statement,particularly in light
<br>
of the subject of memes coming up in the previous post.Myths,stories,etc. are
<br>
carriers for memes,both good and bad.I happen to think that matters quite a
<br>
bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     fact that a story exists and is patently false does not provide data about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the truth of unrelated projections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
But is it a fact that the story in question is patently false?If you plan on
<br>
creating God(i.e.,an all-knowing,all-powerful Sysop),you should at least be
<br>
open to the idea that someone else may have beaten you to the punch.
<br>
<p>Eliezer,I dearly hope that this isn't taken as anything thing more than
<br>
gentle discourse.I have nothing but the highest respect for you,and everyone
<br>
else who takes the time to post here.Thanks for reading,and please continue
<br>
stimulating my tiny,pre-transhuman brain.

<em>&gt; &gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   I'm breaking out of lurk mode at last,please be gentle.I'm always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fascinated by the unexpected directions these discussions take,but I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like to start by merely pointing out one interesting  tangent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Singularity the current,technology-friendly version of the same world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ending/transforming myths that are at the heart of all the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; religions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  Do you have any other questions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize that this is an &quot;interesting tangent&quot;, and that you haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lived through the endless dreary discussions on the Extropians list as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have, and that there are probably some people on the list who haven't yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been transhumanists long enough to be as heartily sick of this topic as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am, so I'm not following my natural inclinations, which are to censor this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outright.  You don't know, they don't know, I shouldn't snap at anyone;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine, I accept that.  It's even possible that there are a few people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list who, not knowing better, would take a KillThread as a confession
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Sacred Cowdom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I was five or so, I read a people-fake-up-a-ghost story in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wise protagonist explains at one point:  &quot;There are two ways to believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ghosts.  One way is full belief; believing that ghosts and goblins really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.  The other way is half-belief; saying you don't believe, that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a superstition, but still starting at noises in the night, and making up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strange explanations whenever you see something unusual.  And in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, half-believing is worse.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stories are just stories.  They don't matter one way or the other.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that a story exists and is patently false does not provide data about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth of unrelated projections.  &quot;The world's biggest fool may say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark out.&quot;  (Robert Persig, _Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_.)
