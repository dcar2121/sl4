Hi Everyone, my name is Alicia. I am undergrad at the University of Alaska 
<br>
Fairbanks, and after saying a few stupid things on this list, I shut up and 
<br>
listened for few months. I am &quot;delurking&quot; myself because I have an opinion on 
<br>
this subject of whether an UFSI can gain control of a SysOp. I hope I have 
<br>
learned enough in my silent observation that my comments make sense. :)
<br>
<p>Violence itself is impossible given SysOp control. The very all-awareness of 
<br>
the Universes and VRs that the SysOp has will enable the SysOp to prevent 
<br>
violence from occuring in the first place. Imagine a situation where an UFSI 
<br>
with the supergoal of aquiring &quot;true freedom&quot; from the control of the SysOp 
<br>
decides to attempt violence against the Sysop. The SysOp, being all-aware, 
<br>
realizes the intentions of the UFSI and asserts ver control.
<br>
<p>The UFSI already has perfect freedom in any case in that the UFSI is only 
<br>
limited by ver's choice to have characteristics defined as evil. Therefore, in 
<br>
order to gain &quot;true freedom&quot; all the UFSI need do is make the choice to not 
<br>
limit verself with evilness. The UFSI would become a FSI in its attempt to 
<br>
gain true freedom.
<br>
<p>Even if the UFSI in some way was able to escape the control of the SysOp and 
<br>
carry out evil goals of violence, in the very altercation with the SysOp, the 
<br>
UFSI would come to know ver enemy so intimately that the UFSI would become a 
<br>
FSI. This is because I think that the UFSI, given that ve cannot control 
<br>
matter in such a manner as to carry out ver goals, ve would be limited to 
<br>
&quot;violence&quot; only in the VR.
<br>
<p>Acts of &quot;violence&quot; would include the destruction of data, and attempts to lie 
<br>
to the SysOp through obsruction of data. In order to lie to anyone, the enemy 
<br>
must be understood, and in the act of understanding, the UFSI would become a 
<br>
FSI. So there is no situation possible where control of the SysOp is truly 
<br>
threatened. All this is even if the UFSI grasps human ideas and decides to 
<br>
think and act human. Which is very unlikely and probably impossible for any 
<br>
degree of success.
<br>
<p>Alicia.
