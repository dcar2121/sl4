<p>Of course not, thet're still humans and have all the natural rights 
<br>
that other humans have.  But let's face it:  there just isn't much 
<br>
inside a child's mind worth uploading.  If they were uploaded, they'd 
<br>
quickly becoming something totally unlike the child

</em><br>
<p>We can only speculate now, but my guess is that SIs will not want 
<br>
children either.  Humans want to produce children because they have 
<br>
to for the species to survive.  Just the opposite is true for SIs. 
<br>
The more SIs that there are, ultimately there will be less 
<br>
computorium for each.  That does not mean that we should stop people 
<br>
from uploading or creating new AIs when needed, but it shouldn't be 
<br>
done just to have someone else to talk to (use a simulation for that).
<br>
<p>Aside from the Borg being a bad bit of SF television, does the show 
<br>
really ever tell us that much about them to draw the conclusion that 
<br>
they really are that bad.  Forcing people into their hive minds is 
<br>
bad, but we don't really know what it's like inside the things. 
<br>
Also, I think that the Borg had some kind of problem, since they 
<br>
could have gotten more out of creating uploads and turning the bodies 
<br>
into computornium, but that's Star Trek for you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;P.S.  Sorry to everyone for the flame, but I haven't read anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that irked me this much in years.  Obviously he doesn't have kids.
</em><br>
<p>If this was a flame, I'd hate to see it when you get really mad.  ;^)
<br>
<p>I don't.  Also, go into the archives and read my join message (I 
<br>
think that it was posted December of last year).  As you'll see, it 
<br>
hasn't been that long since I was a kid and I know that most kids 
<br>
even at 12 and 13 still weren't very interesting and worth uploading 
<br>
(there were a few, myself included, but otherwise everyone was 
<br>
focused on trying to fit in).  Maybe you'll feel better if I tell you 
<br>
that they can make theirselves worth something after being uploaded, 
<br>
should they choose to do so.
<br>
<p>Also, this makes me think, can parents force children to upload 
<br>
(obviously parents would have a hard time stopping their kids from 
<br>
doing it)?  Under current laws, at least in the US, I think so, but 
<br>
by the time lawmakers get it figured out it will probably no longer 
<br>
be an issue since most folks who were going to upload would have.
