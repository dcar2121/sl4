<p>Wait, I should clarify.  Of course and SI based on a person will not 
<br>
be like them, but what I mean is that any bit of personality that the 
<br>
child might have had would be swallowed up by the reprograming 
<br>
process and the necessary education to be an SI.  By contrast, when 
<br>
you, me, or anyone else at the very least on this list and those 
<br>
found in plenty of other places are uploaded, sure, we'll be very 
<br>
different afterwards, but there will still be some hint of who we 
<br>
were.  Of course, this is speculation.  Maybe we'll upload to find 
<br>
that there is a paragon personality that everyone should have and 
<br>
will program themselves to have.  That would be pretty boring, but it 
<br>
is a possibility, as much as from where I am now I would like to 
<br>
avoid it.
