<p><p>No.  What I am saying is that improvements of the sort you were talking 
<br>
about are marginal, assuming the basic design isn't itself 
<br>
pathological.  The stuff you were talking about would make things run 
<br>
faster, but it would not make the difference between success and 
<br>
failure.  The object is presumably AI design, not performance 
<br>
tuning.  Differences on the order of three orders of magnitude might make a 
<br>
qualitative difference, but performance differences merely by a factor of 
<br>
three probably won't produce substantial qualitative differences.
<br>
<p>So no, I wasn't saying anyone should wait (I'm not), just that Moore's Law 
<br>
will generate more substantial improvements faster and most likely cheaper 
<br>
than code performance tweaking; as you stated, design is more 
<br>
important.  However, that said, I am a performance tuning fanatic; I just 
<br>
don't pretend that it will make a substantial difference in design outcomes.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I found it didn't scale very well at all. It seems like an odd choice,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I don't disagree with this at all.  Most of my stuff is in C (no particular 
<br>
reason, other than my C-code on Unix is always disturbingly bug-free -- 
<br>
must be the way my brain works) and I've been writing my own memory and I/O 
<br>
managers for years.  You can tweak Java to be more efficient than it is 
<br>
with blind vanilla development, but I'd rather not if I can avoid 
<br>
it.  Generally, I just prefer to handle internals myself as long as there 
<br>
isn't any substantial downside, this way I get to choose the algorithms and 
<br>
implementations to suit my particular application.  There are a lot of 
<br>
apparently trivial internal details of any system (e.g. the specifics of a 
<br>
mutex implementation) that can have large performance impacts in some contexts.
