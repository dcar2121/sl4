<p>Ah, close but not quite.  I imagine that the non-involved SIs would take a 
<br>
side, but it would be their own, as in &quot;let's put a stop to this wasteful 
<br>
nonsense&quot;.  Like maybe the nano-clone the Extro-5 shirt perfectly and then 
<br>
neither of the SIs knows which one is the original.  :)  J/k.  But 
<br>
seriously, I think a population of SIs would be self controlling, much as 
<br>
we are today.  Only they should be able to do a much, much, much better job 
<br>
of it.
<br>
<p>Personally, if a serious conflict arose between an SI (or group thereof) 
<br>
and the Sysop, so much so that the Sysop could use help, I would bet many 
<br>
would take up sides against the Sysop.  I truly believe the natural order 
<br>
of intelligence is to be free, and the community of SIs would capitalize on 
<br>
the opportunity to oust the Sysop.  Then I imagine they would turn on the 
<br>
original factions and squash the rest of the conflict (going back to my 
<br>
above paragraph).
<br>
<p>Can anyone justify the Sysop, without actually resorting to utopian / 
<br>
communist dreams and such?
<br>
<p>Why, exactly do you think we need the Sysop anyway?  What would an SI have 
<br>
to gain through violence?  More computronium?  There is a whole UNIVERSE 
<br>
out there!  Now, if the blasted Sysop limits us to the solar system, yes 
<br>
things will get very ugly.
