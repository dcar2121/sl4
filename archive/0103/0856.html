<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; May very well be true, but 've' still sounds goofy.  I hear more stupid

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Now *that* has an impact on me.  (Why?  Usually, when I hear someone say

<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Other people won't like X.&quot;, my response is &quot;Take responsibility for your

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;*seeing* other people react badly...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, I've had totally different experiences.  In fact, I've found that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to point out the use of gender neutral pronouns for them to notice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it.  In fact, I've regularly used them in e-mails with one friend for 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;let me know that she hadn't even noticed!  No one I know even seems to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;care when I do use them, they just read on and if I bring up the subject

</em><br>
<em>&gt;noticed what I was doing but quickly realized that they were pronouns and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accepted it as something new that he just didn't know about).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here is another way to look at it.  My mom has a Mac, but she didn't even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notice when the Mac OS started using NeXT style scroll bars instead of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regular scroll bars.  When I brought it up, she said she had noticed that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something was different and upon inspection realized what it was, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;otherwise went on living her computer life.  Such a change might seem like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a big deal to those of us involved deeply in the issue, but the rest of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world isn't concerned at all.  The average person just accepts what ve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is given.
</em><br>
<p>Wow, you must know a completely different lot of people than I do.  The 
<br>
people I know actually speak up when they don't understand something.  And, 
<br>
I do apologize, but I simply can't believe* that anyone could read this 
<br>
without even noticing the use of the v pronouns.  They stood out like a 
<br>
sore thumb when I was first reading this stuff, so I went and found out 
<br>
what they meant.  But I still notice them, especially when trying to write 
<br>
about it and I keep wondering if I'm using the correct spelling or whatever.
<br>
<p>* One possible exception, if the people in question have extensively read 
<br>
Vernor Vinge previously and are now accustomed to reading these pronouns, 
<br>
then I could see them not paying attention to them.
