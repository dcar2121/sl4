<p>A major tenet of Buddhism is the doctrine of no-soul (or no-self;
<br>
&quot;anatta&quot;).
<br>
<p>Buddhist teleology posits a time when all beings are Enlightened, which is
<br>
to say, all beings have entered Nirvana. But Nirvana itself was never
<br>
defined in a postive sense by Gautama Buddha, who preferred to say what it
<br>
is not. He defined Nirvana as no clinging, no suffering, etc.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the Buddha choose to remain silent when asked certain questions,
<br>
such as whether the universe is finite or infinite. When asked why he did
<br>
not answer, Buddha responded that he taught only what would help
<br>
individuals. He considered speculation to be unhelpful. Therefore, so far
<br>
as I know, there is no teaching in Buddhism about an end to the universe.
<br>
