Actually, I find it odd to hear Phil Goetz arguing about how NASA does 
<br>
things and about how things are done in science.  I agree that the single 
<br>
genius, or the small band of innovators, are not &quot;how things are done&quot; in 
<br>
the 21st century, but I think that it's worth noting that per-capita, and 
<br>
moreso per dollar, not a lot does get done in the 21st century.  Certainly 
<br>
not compared to the late 19th century.  Specialization in science appears to 
<br>
me to have been less an innovation than a ghastly mistake.  Sort of like the 
<br>
abandonment of place notation around the 8th century BC or the replacement 
<br>
of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with the use of bellows in the late 19th 
<br>
century.  These things happen.  Progress and metaprogress are not a streight 
<br>
road.  There may even be anthropic selection in place, preventing UFAI so 
<br>
far by retarding progress.
<br>
Anyway, if we need mental superheroes to get AI, and we don't need mental 
<br>
superheroes to get IA for making mental superheroes, it would seem that a 
<br>
two step transition process is in order.  Eliezer thinks that the necessary 
<br>
IA is acquired expertise on failings of human cognition.  I agree, but think 
<br>
that biotech or superior recruiting for more rapid acquisition of said 
<br>
expertise might be a good intermediate step.
