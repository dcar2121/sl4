<p>
I mentioned in my JOIN that I'm working on a model of intelligence using 
<br>
emotion as the driving force.  When I posted that message to SIAI, I got 
<br>
some questions back about it, so I'll post my reply here as well.  I was 
<br>
writing up another email clarifying some things and explaining some more 
<br>
of the complexity involved, but for the sake of netiquette I'll just 
<br>
send this out for the moment and save the extra stuff for when I 
<br>
(hopefully) get some questions back.
<br>
<p><p><p>The fundamental driving force behind emotional intelligence (as I see 
<br>
it) is a desire to be happy.  &quot;Happiness&quot; in the case of AI is just a 
<br>
number, as are all emotions.  In a biological intelligence there is some 
<br>
correlation for emotions as simple vectors - it might, for example, be 
<br>
reasonable to measure the fear level of a creature based upon the amount 
<br>
of adrenaline in its system.
<br>
<p>The catch is, the system cannot make itself happy.  All of the input it 
<br>
is given affects its emotional state - if it observes people who are 
<br>
happy, it becomes happy itself.  In essence, it is driven by a desire to 
<br>
make other people happy - or, to put that another way, it is driven by 
<br>
&quot;friendliness&quot;.
<br>
<p>Alongside basic happiness sit a number of other basic emotions - fear, 
<br>
anger, etc etc.  Again, each of these cannot be influenced directly by 
<br>
the being itself (at least not by conscious thought), they are primarily 
<br>
controlled by external influences.
<br>
<p>Above these primal emotions sit more complex emotions, such as 
<br>
confidence, stubbornness, and optimism.  (There is a threshold at which 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;these should be regarded as personality traits, although that's not 
<br>
strictly relevant).  Each of these more complex emotions has a smaller 
<br>
influence on overall happiness, but at the same time are influenced less 
<br>
by external factors.  As a general rule, every emotion is controlled by 
<br>
two things - external influences, and other emotions.  Any emotion which 
<br>
has a large effect on overall happiness is controlled more readily by 
<br>
external influences.
<br>
<p>Example: Optimism is strongly affected by external influences.  Optimism 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;controls how likely you are to take a chance - if the chance pays off, 
<br>
your optimism goes up, and you feel happier because of it.  At the same 
<br>
time, stubbornness affects optimism, but does not directly affect 
<br>
happiness much.  If you are stubborn in a given situation, you are less 
<br>
likely to take a chance, and the happiness increase when that chance 
<br>
succeeds is far less.
<br>
<p>Memory is a combination of two things.  Firstly, a word - the concept in 
<br>
question.  Secondly, attached to each word is a set of emotional vectors 
<br>
which comprise the beings total experience about that object or concept. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the being encounters an object that it recognises, it consults its 
<br>
memory to see how that object has made it feel in the past, determines 
<br>
whether the emotions it presents are appropriate for its current mental 
<br>
state, and either promotes or avoids the encounter accordingly.
<br>
<p>Example:  Let's say that in the past, you have been bitten by a dog. 
<br>
Pain is a universal way to reduce happiness (much like pleasure is a 
<br>
universal way to increase it), so the emotional vectors associated with 
<br>
your memory of a dog include negative happiness.  However, if you see a 
<br>
person holding a dog and you remember that the person has, in the past, 
<br>
made you very happy, you may still decide that the dog is not worth 
<br>
avoiding; the negative happiness based upon your experiences with dogs 
<br>
are offset by the positive happiness of your experiences with the 
<br>
person, and you can make an intelligent decision on how to respond to 
<br>
the situation.
<br>
<p>Automated learning, in any given situation, is simply the product of 
<br>
combining a number of different emotional memories together in order to 
<br>
achieve the required goal.  You program the system with a number of 
<br>
basic operations that could be applied to the task, and let the system 
<br>
experiment randomly, learning based upon emotion along the way.
<br>
<p>If, for example, correctly recognising a face stimulates &quot;pleasure&quot; 
<br>
(either by seeing that the face is smiling, or by the programmer 
<br>
pressing the &quot;pleasure&quot; button), then whatever operations were used to 
<br>
perform that recognition (adjust brightness, decrease color depth, 
<br>
adjust contrast, etc etc) are then given higher happiness ratings, and 
<br>
are more likely to be used again.  The act of randomly combining 
<br>
operations together is based upon emotion, and the success or failure of 
<br>
each attempt is similarly stored as emotion.  If, for example, the 
<br>
computer takes a chance on a new graphics operation when attempting the 
<br>
recognition, it will remember whether it tried it before and failed 
<br>
based upon the stored value for confidence; if its confidence is high at 
<br>
that time then it may still take a chance on it.
<br>
<p><p><p>There's a lot more complexity than what I've presented here, but I think 
<br>
this should convey the gist of what I'm thinking.  Hopefully that's 
<br>
enough to let people start exploring the idea themselves, and hopefully 
<br>
I can answer some of your questions.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>Chris
