</em><br>
<p>I suspect that you will be much better off if you use more accurate language.
<br>
&quot;Impossible&quot; means &quot;in principle cannot be done.&quot; A lot of people have used the
<br>
term &quot;impossible&quot; in the past. It wasn't that they meant your definition. They
<br>
meant mine, but they were wrong. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      Anyway, we aren't really arguing about what can or cannot be done.  We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all agree that an AI with the solar system at its disposal can get out of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; box.  We are playing the Jared Diamond game of arguing about what can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done with a particular set of resources.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is exactly what we are doing, because it's a lot more important to
<br>
boxing than what an AI can do with a solar system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Such mistakes never happen in analytically tractable systems like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tic-tac-toe, but always happen in complex systems, such as any physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system capable of implementing a GAI must be.
</em><br>
<p>I can't tell whether you mean you mean this to be an extensional claim with
<br>
the extension being your experience, extensional with the extension being the
<br>
actual world, or a necessary claim. The first claim may be true, but I don't
<br>
think it tells us much about the next two claims. The second claim's truth
<br>
value is unknown. The last claim is obviously false.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I actually think that people proposing AI boxes are a bit like literature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majors proposing to lock McGuyver in &quot;a room full of discarded electronics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components&quot;.  
</em><br>
<p>Well I actually think that Nostradamus and Pauly Shore are the same person.
<br>
Also, what the hell do &quot;literature majors&quot; have to do with this argument? Are
<br>
they a paradigm case of naive or something?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any GAI will have the equipment to produce and detect electromagnetic waves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a variety of frequencies, to produce magnetic fields with extremely fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precision, to generate extremely focused heat, and probably to manipulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanical actuators such as those used in the hard drive and cathode ray
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tube (alternatively, a huge field of liquid crystal under fine electronic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control).  It will probably have some ability to reverse all of its input 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices.  It will have a large number of different types of atoms and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molecules within itself, some of which can probably be used for lasers (in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most PCs, it will actually have lasers in the CD drive), a power supply, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many tools that I have overlooked.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;And these can be used to break out in a way we can't stop as follows...&quot;
<br>
<p>Aside from the fact that we can get rid of or restrict a lot of those
<br>
components, I don't see why we should believe in the first place that they
<br>
would allow the AI to break a box.
