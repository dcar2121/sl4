Hello.

<em>&gt; &gt; makes both of these

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As Tennessee Leeuwenburg seems to define them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objective morality is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claim by some person that their personal morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an objective fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whereas universal morality claims that there some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality out there which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; applies universally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you meant something else by either of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terms, feel free to clarify.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How does one find out whether a morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;applying universally.&quot;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; already showed that no experiment will do the trick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Thus that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaningless too, as there is no way to find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which morality is universal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rubbish.  Plenty of  physics concepts are supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'apply universally'.  That doesn't stop us  assigning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational probabilities to supposed 'universals' on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis of finite evidence.  Rationality is a process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assessing competing *explanations* to see which works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best.
</em><br>
I agree with you so far. (except for the &quot;Rubbish&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To treat Universal Morality scientifically we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would simply form multiple hypotheses about sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour
</em><br>
Stop right there!  Questions about morality are not about what sentients
<br>
*actually* do.  They are about what they *should* do.  If you found a sentient
<br>
life form that thinks eating human babies is moral would you change your
<br>
opinions on baby eating?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and use 'inference to the best explanation'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cut down the space of probability by selecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis with the best explanatory power, just as we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do for every other branch of science.   
</em><br>
<p>To summarize, the reason that you can't treat universal morality
<br>
scientifically is that there are no testable experiments that could
<br>
demonstrate whether any particular morality is in fact the universal one.
<br>
There is absolutely nothing wrong with induction.  However, induction can't
<br>
be used here because there is no evidence on which to use it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Physics isn't Psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you sure?  Objective Idealism treats physics as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of cognition you know.  How can something be said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exist at all if it wasn't being *interpreted* by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort of cognitive proccess?  Everything you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the world requires a mental model to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehended you realize?
</em><br>
<p>So physics is a form of cognition?  Things exist by being interpreted?
<br>
Alright then!  Let's put that to the test!  Nope.  Sorry.  The test object
<br>
failed to disappear when I stopped thinking about it.  I was also completely
<br>
unsuccessful at telekinesis.
<br>
<p>If all reality were just interpreted, don't you think these feats would be
<br>
common place?  They would be as simple as changing one's point of view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The Laws of the Universe are simple and pretty as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; far as we can tell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The human brain is a hodge podge of layered complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; function adaptations, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of which are set up to deal with medium sized things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for medium length times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the plains of Africa.  Given that the brain was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; made by a blind watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maker who cares far less about consistency than even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Microsoft, what makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you expect there to be underlying principles?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did I mention the *human* mind specifically ?  No.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was talking about *sentient minds in general*.
</em><br>
<p>--- GENERAL VS. SPECIFIC ---
<br>
If you make a statement about sentient minds in general, it must also apply to
<br>
humans, because they are an instance of sentient minds in general.  If you
<br>
expect sentient minds in general to have underlying principles, human minds
<br>
must also share those same principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Abstract out all the arbitrary hodge podge features of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human brain and look *only* at the *neccessery*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features - the general properties of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required for rationality and self-awareness.
</em><br>
<p>--- HODGE PODGE ---
<br>
Now there's a tricky one!  How we know which principles are necessary
<br>
for sentience?  Sentience is not a very well understood phenomenon.  Of
<br>
course, if I use Mark Geddes' definition of sentience (if one was proposed)
<br>
then he will naturally be completely right about everything he says about it.
<br>
<p>And even if I conceded that definition of the word sentience, we would still
<br>
have to worry about all the &quot;non-sentients&quot; which might do nasty things like
<br>
baby munching or tiling the universe with paper clips.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains run on physical laws, there should be general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles that apply to all sentients.
</em><br>
<p>--- COMMON PRINCIPLES ---
<br>
Firstly I should point out that &quot;principle&quot; has at least two meanings, a
<br>
physical meaning, as in &quot;the principle of least distance&quot; and a moral
<br>
meaning, as in &quot;a person of principle&quot;.  They are very different.  You are
<br>
intentionally or unintentionally mixing them up.
<br>
<p>So, sure, the laws of electromagnetism apply to all sentients, as do all the
<br>
other established physical principles.  But this does not mean that the
<br>
resulting intelligences follow common moral principles.  No morality is
<br>
inherent in the universe for reasons I already explained.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Again, human values and human intelligence are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fundamental principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They are the products of complex functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; adaptations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, did I mention *human* values and *human*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence specifically.  No.  I was talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Values and Intelligence *in general*.  
</em><br>
See GENERAL VS. SPECIFIC.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consciousness, Values and Intelligence *are*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental properties of the cosmos that need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained.
</em><br>
--- PROGRAM ANALOGY ---
<br>
Really?  Is &lt;insert your favorite large computer program here&gt; a fundamental
<br>
property of the microchip it is running on?  Try imagining your program with
<br>
some new feature added, or some old feature discarded and you will see why
<br>
that program was not fundamental.  In the same way it is not hard to
<br>
hypothesize many different versions of consciousness, values and intelligence.
<br>
<p>In the same way, all three of the properties you mention are no more
<br>
fundamental to the universe than the program is to the microchip.  Our
<br>
versions of these three things are complex functional adaptations to our
<br>
evolutionary environment.  AIs and aliens will have different versions by
<br>
reason of different design/evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Humans are not the only beings that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious, have intelligence and have values.
</em><br>
Yes.  However the values may be completely different from ours, and the
<br>
consciousness is optional.  Computer programs can say practically anything.
<br>
An intelligence can believe practically anything about what is desirable, or
<br>
may not even have that concept in any recognizable form.  That is the point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And as I pointed out above, if you abstract out all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hodge-podge features, you'd be left with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general features common to all sentients.
</em><br>
See HODGE PODGE.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just throw brains together willy-nilly.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common physical principles required for brains to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.
</em><br>
See COMMON PRINCIPLES.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you are not defining Universal as all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humanity, which would make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Collective, what or who do you even mean by it?  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you are postulating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deity, it might really be time for somebody to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the list sniper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never mentioned a deity.    Read what I say.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly defined 'Universal' as something held in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common *by all logically possible sentients*.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly different from a Collective.  See the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Collective:  Something defined by reference to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *currently* existing sentients in some context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universal:  Something deifned by reference to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *logically possible* sentients.
</em><br>
The space of all logically possible sentients is absolutely massive!
<br>
Besides sentience itself, I very much doubt you will find much in common.
<br>
See PROGRAM ANALOGY and COMMON PRINCIPLES.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So I get Enlightened when I become truly aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the hodge podge that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the human brain?  I seriously doubt it.  If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really about knew all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kludges and piled up lies that the brain uses to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accomplish its evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; business would we really be all that happy?  On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contrary, I suspect it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would offend our moral sensibilities, and make us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to move out of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wetware and become truly decent people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, read what I say!   I said you get enlightened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by learning about your *true* nature, not every part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your nature.  I defined your *true* nature to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only that small part of yourself which is *universal*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - i.e common to all logically possible sentients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, ignore all the kludges and hodge-potch features
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your mind.  These are not part of your true nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I have defined it here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which parts of your mind enable you to be self-aware,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reason and to be altruistic?  *These* are your true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature.  All the other evolutionary kludges are just fluff.
</em><br>
<p>You say my true nature is to be self-aware, to reason and to be altruistic.
<br>
I might even admit that that is definition of sane humanity's true nature, or
<br>
at least what we want it to be, albeit an over-simplified one.
<br>
<p>But, to say that these are the true nature of sentience is another thing all
<br>
together.  You are listing treating three distinct properties as a single
<br>
unit.
<br>
<p>All three of these properties are probably as un-fundamental as the existence
<br>
of rice pudding and income tax.  (See PROGRAM ANALOGY)
<br>
<p>Why not a mind which can reason but is neither self-aware nor altruistic?
<br>
Why not a mind which can reason and is self-aware but not altruistic?
<br>
<p>Time and time again, history has recorded humanity believing it is the center
<br>
of the universe in some way and inevitably being wrong.  I have already shown
<br>
that there is no universal morality in any meaningful way.  It would be the
<br>
height of anthropomorphic arrogance to assume that an intelligence must have
<br>
values similar to ours in order to progress beyond any specific point.
