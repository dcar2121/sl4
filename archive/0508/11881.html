Recently I saw a documentary about Robert McNamara.  Part
<br>
of it involved his role in World War II, planning the
<br>
bombing of Japan.  They flashed across the screen names of
<br>
different cities, and the number of Japanese civilians
<br>
killed in each one.
<br>
<p>I also happen to know a little bit about the number of
<br>
German civilians killed in bombings of German cities.  My
<br>
mother was at Dresden the night it was bombed, and she said
<br>
the entire city was packed with refugees.
<br>
<p>Anyway, what I'm getting to is that the number of civilians
<br>
we killed in WW2 with conventional bombs was somewhere
<br>
between 10 and 50 times as many as we killed with nuclear
<br>
bombs.  Curiously, a brief Google search turns up many
<br>
references to the number of civilians killed by the atomic
<br>
bomb, and a few references to Dresden and Tokyo, but I
<br>
don't see anyone who has attempted to estimate the total
<br>
number of civilians killed by conventional bombs.  Total
<br>
civilian deaths in World War 2 were about twenty million,
<br>
not counting 30 million or so Soviet citizens killed by
<br>
their own government throughout the 30's and early 40's,
<br>
IIRC.
<br>
<p>But even conventional bombs are more tech than you need.
<br>
The most massive exterminations in history - in China,
<br>
the USSR, Germany, Cambodia, Rwanda, and Uganda, for
<br>
instance - were conducted with knives, clubs, and guns.
<br>
<p>On one hand, you could say this suggests that we shouldn't
<br>
worry about future technologies for killing people, as we
<br>
already do that quite well.  On the other hand, you could
<br>
say that comparing nanotech, biotech, and unfriendly AI to
<br>
the atomic bomb trivializes the former.  The atomic bomb
<br>
is just another weapon by comparison.
