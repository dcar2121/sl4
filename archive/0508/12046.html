<p><em>&gt; &gt; Look at Chris Eliasmith's book, &quot;Neural engineering&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is an excellent start on constructing modular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems out of neural networks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is much closer to Loosemore's position, though I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; /sure/ that he's proposing to use emergence to build an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (it just seems likely). As I've doubtless made clear, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider this silly.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what to make of this answer,
<br>
since neither my statement nor the book have anything
<br>
to do with emergence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this is learned complexity, that we want an AGI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; induce from an environment or possibly some processed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge source. I assume that you're claiming that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need control theory and signal processing to design the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic substrate of the AI, before it learns anything.
</em><br>
<p>Something like that - I would say that, if you want to
<br>
replicate what brains do, it would be good to think about
<br>
functions that map high-dimensional inputs into
<br>
high-dimensional outputs, rather than about arithmetic
<br>
or logic operators.  Signal processing has accumulated
<br>
a large toolkit of useful functions of that kind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not see the relevance of either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these to the design of a rational inference substrate.
</em><br>
<p>If you're thinking of programming an AI by creating
<br>
a rational inference substrate - e.g., a 1970s-style
<br>
logic engine - I'm surprised.  There are many
<br>
lines of evidence that such an approach is hopeless,
<br>
and I seldom use the word &quot;hopeless&quot;.  I would mention
<br>
category theory, image recognition, consistent human
<br>
failures of logic, and metaphorical language as a few
<br>
among many.  If you still hold to that approach, I doubt
<br>
an attempt to persuade you otherwise will help either of
<br>
us.
<br>
I have already banged my head against that wall long
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>Not that I haven't programmed plenty of logic engines.
<br>
It's where the AI funding is.  It just isn't what we need.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can see why you'd think you needed them, if you thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that connectionism and emergence were a good idea.
</em><br>
<p>You're still speaking as if I were the one advocating
<br>
emergence, but you're the one advocating creating a
<br>
&quot;basic substrate&quot; and letting learning do the rest,
<br>
which is a more emergence-friendly viewpoint.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok, so we have at least two people sharing this view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly more if the AAII people are taking this view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern processing.
</em><br>
<p>What is AAII?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clearly you would not go as far in simplification,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in my view you have inverted the sensible layering of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity as well as introducing some pointless and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poorly understood holdovers from human cognitive design.
</em><br>
<p>I'm guessing that you are thinking that pure logic is the
<br>
way to go, and human logic &quot;failures&quot; are design flaws,
<br>
whereas I am thinking of them as necessary tradeoffs
<br>
that must be understood rather than being dismissed
<br>
as &quot;pointless and poorly understood holdovers&quot;.
<br>
How is your viewpoint different from the old AI
<br>
viewpoint that we spent the 1980s and 1990s demolishing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We have evidence that, at least in some cases, brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use attractors, possibly chaotic ones, as memory
</em><br>
elements.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree. I've read plenty of papers on the subject. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do better. That's not even a statement of hubris, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the task of designing an AGI to run on a (pretty good and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast approximation of a) Turing machine is much easier,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the absolute sense, than designing one to run on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammal neurons.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we can do better.  The &quot;inaccurate&quot;,
<br>
highly flexible, fuzzy categorization is an advantage,
<br>
not a design flaw.  I'm afraid I may even want to add
<br>
endocrinology to our list of necessary communities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do agree that you need fuzzy logic to do those things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (it is, at the risk of sounding like a broken record,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not sufficient). Fuzzy logic is of course a subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian/probabilistic reasoning.
</em><br>
<p>I don't mean fuzzy logic.  Fuzzy logic is still logic.
<br>
Real intelligent systems don't use logic, ever,
<br>
except when humans have explicitly learned logic,
<br>
in which case the use of logic is probably implemented
<br>
using the same mechanisms as other learned tasks, such
<br>
as playing the piano.
