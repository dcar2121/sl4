<em>&gt; So I will argue that there are no plausible assumptions in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy of &quot;create a superintelligent AI and keep it in a box&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe _and_ useful _and_ feasible. Therefore, however confident you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your ability to keep a box sealed, it doesn't make sense to set out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create a superintelligent AI unless you have a plan for making sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will be Friendly.
</em><br>
<p>The box is an additional line of defense, in case one was overconfident about
<br>
that 'surefire Friendliness plan.' Here's my scenario:
<br>
<p>1. Create that &quot;plan for making sure it will be Friendly,&quot; and examine it until
<br>
you are very sure that it will work.
<br>
2. Construct an implementation in a box.
<br>
3. Ask the AI for techniques to verify that the plan to create Friendliness was
<br>
guaranteed to work: advances in computer science, designs for nootropic drugs
<br>
to enhance programmer intelligence, humanly comprehensible analyses of the
<br>
design etc.
<br>
4. If the AI delivers and the techniques can be used to independently verify
<br>
that the original design was indeed correct, build a new AI to that
<br>
specification, monitoring its development using the enhanced intelligence and
<br>
better techniques. The original AI is not released until after it can no longer
<br>
take over the world (due the presence of other AIs.) Otherwise, destroy the
<br>
boxed AI and try to use fMRI lie detectors or other advanced social control
<br>
technologies to prevent individuals from wiping out humanity with
<br>
nanotechnology and the like.
