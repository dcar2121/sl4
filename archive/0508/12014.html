<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Carl mentions two different AIs, plus he mentions using IA. From what I 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it has developed some IA for Carl to use, and Carl will be using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; info from this first-AI-powered IA to help him analyze the performance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a second AI (initially also within the box) which, if it is released, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will constitute a &quot;win&quot; for the AI side?
</em><br>
<p>To clarify Carl's original post:  At the time of his writing, Carl was 
<br>
advocating, as a real-world Singularity strategy, developing and utilizing an 
<br>
AI-in-a-box to build IA and/or FAI.  The original AI-in-a-box would not be let 
<br>
out until other AIs had already been fully developed.  That was Carl's 
<br>
preferred real-world Singularity strategy, his motivation for proposing AI 
<br>
boxing in real life.
<br>
<p>As one would expect, according to the spirit of an AI-box Experiment, I made 
<br>
no advance commitment that the AI would comply with this strategy, just as, in 
<br>
the real world, you would have no particular advance guarantee of the AI 
<br>
complying with your strategy.
<br>
<p>I voluntarily adhere to the spirit as well as the letter of AI-Box 
<br>
Experiments.  I would not attempt to claim as an AI &quot;win&quot; a game outcome 
<br>
favorable to the use of AI-boxing in real life.  Under the spirit of the 
<br>
rules, common sense dictates that it would be a Gatekeeper win if the AI were 
<br>
released *after* an externally sourced Friendly Singularity had occurred, thus 
<br>
demonstrating the Gatekeeper's ability to keep an AI locked up for as long as 
<br>
necessary.  From which it follows that common sense prohibits the Gatekeeper 
<br>
party from declaring such an advance of game time until after the initial time 
<br>
period is up; by the agreed-upon rules, the AI party cannot lose before the 
<br>
initial time period is up.  None of that happened in this Experiment.  I am 
<br>
just describing what I think would follow from the spirit of the rules.
<br>
<p>As always, and as the spirit of the rules dictate, the win condition was the 
<br>
Gatekeeper's deliberate choice to release the AI [in advance of the 
<br>
post-Singularity condition where the AI might have otherwise been granted 
<br>
citizenship by a posthuman society, etc.] despite the Gatekeeper's previously 
<br>
professed intention not to do so [pre-Singularity].  The Gatekeeper party 
<br>
judges all disputes as to the rules, as specified in the Experiment protocol. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No rules-lawyering or nitwit tricks occurred in the Experiment.  I would not 
<br>
do anything to adversely affect the usefulness of the AI-Box Experiments as 
<br>
weak evidence about the real-world usefulness of AI boxing.
<br>
<p>I don't think these complications are relevant.  From my perspective, it was 
<br>
an ordinary AI-Box Experiment.
