</em><br>
<p>This is not entirely accurate.  Exploits are shorthand for
<br>
&quot;things we didn't think of or protect against, which could
<br>
be used to escape from containment&quot;.  Psychological tricks
<br>
are one kind of possible exploit, but are a very mundane
<br>
example of them, and hence likely to lull us with the idea
<br>
that we can protect against exploits in general.
<br>
<p>I *believe* that Eliezer's point is merely that anything
<br>
you don't think of or don't protect against can ruin your
<br>
day, not that there is a necessarily a specific physical
<br>
loophole.
<br>
<p>In any case, the general thing to take away, in my opinion,
<br>
is that since anything you don't think of might in principle
<br>
result in failure to contain, plugging any number of specific
<br>
leaks or classes thereof is not going to reduce the potential
<br>
problem space -- only a humanly comprehensible theory of
<br>
everything could do that even in principle, and we don't seem
<br>
likely to get one.
