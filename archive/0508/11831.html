<p><em>&gt; If you read <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html</a> you will see why you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Give me some credit. I was careful to never say &quot;zero probability&quot; just in case
<br>
whatever I thought had zero probability actually happened, and I wanted to
<br>
believe it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The best probability estimate we can get is by analogy to historical cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from dogs to Lord Kelvin.  End of story!  You cannot demand a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account of how an AI could break free from a box, else assign probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero.  
</em><br>
<p>But I never did that. This is not about truth, it's about justification. I am
<br>
not justified in assigning any particular probability to the existence of
<br>
plausible exploits. So if I treat it as something I ought to worry about, I am
<br>
not justified in doing so, and therefore paranoid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is like asking for a specific account of how an opponent could win a game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Go against you, else assigning probability zero to your loss.  
</em><br>
<p>It's more like saying if I don't know of any means by which he could win, I'm
<br>
not justified in assuming that he will. However, I do know a means you could
<br>
beat me at Go: you could make a series of moves in such a way that you control
<br>
more territory. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you permit (and you must permit) historical generalizations about similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not identical situations, such as past games of Go, in the absence of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific exhibited possible winning moves against you, then you must permit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical generalizations about similar failures of physical theory and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failures of imagination, in the absence of specific exhibited possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning moves against you.
</em><br>
<p>I'll permit historical generalizations, but what's unclear is whether, in the
<br>
case of physics, those generalizations should tell me that I don't know what's
<br>
going to happen, or that some specific thing is going to happen. I take the
<br>
former position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that's essentially the end of the discussion so far as I'm concerned. 
</em><br>
<p>If you want to stop replying, that's fine, but I'm far from conceding defeat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are simply using probability theory incorrectly.  If you read up on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical rules for assigning probability in the absence of specific support, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will probably get a better idea of where your verbal argument goes wrong, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though you cannot use these methods to calculate a quantitative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability in this case.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think my verbal argument goes wrong. We agree that we are not justified
<br>
in assigning any probability to the existence of exploits. I propose the
<br>
principle that if we are not justified in assigning any probability to X, we
<br>
are not justified in worrying about X. Keep in mind that it might be the case
<br>
that we ought to worry about X even if we aren't justified in doing so, but
<br>
that's not an argument we can make. Do you disagree with my principle? It seems
<br>
like you have to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you believe that some principle of rationality requires you to assign a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero probability to something that could actually go ahead and happen, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negligible probability to something that stands a good chance of really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening, then whatever you are doing is not rationality. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm guessing that you think that (physical) exploits stand a good chance of
<br>
happening, and so they form a counterexample to my principle. I'm not sure I
<br>
buy that, but in any case it doesn't matter because I'm assigning a zero
<br>
justification, not probability. Truth is independent of justification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure there's anything anyone can say to you beyond that.  You appear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have leaped to a conclusion and to be using an alleged principle of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality to justify it, which principle accords not with probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, nor exhibits qualitative correspondence to common sense. 
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. I think my principle exhibits plenty of qualitative correspondence
<br>
to common sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No one else here agrees with your principle and you have made no case for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  If you continue to appeal to the principle, you will convince yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but no one else. 
</em><br>
<p>My case is essentially that if you do not use justification of the likelihood
<br>
of particular worries, then you cannot adjudicate between real and fake worries.
<br>
Why are you worried about exploits and not invisible ninja hippos? I would say
<br>
that I'm not justified in worrying about ninja hippos because of my appeal to
<br>
historical generalizations about the likelihood of ninja hippo attacks. I
<br>
don't think that a historical generalization tells me that exploits are likely.
<br>
In fact, I don't think anything tells me that they are likely. So I don't
<br>
believe in them. Do you think that historical generalizations do tell you that
<br>
exploits are likely, as opposed to just not ruled out? Do you think that the
<br>
same principles of maximum entropy tell you that there are exploits but no
<br>
ninja hippos? I don't get it.
