<p>
Folks,
<br>
<p>I think there is a need for me to do some backfilling here, to clarify 
<br>
some of the misunderstandings that lie at back of what I have been 
<br>
talking about.
<br>
<p>This backfilling is going to take some time, but I need to lay some 
<br>
groundwork.  Hence this message.
<br>
<p>*Please do not take the comments below as arrogance*
<br>
<p><p><p><p>AI research is, and has been for some time, in the most profound 
<br>
trouble.  I will try to explain what I think that trouble is.
<br>
<p>There are several communities/paradigms/constituencies involved in this 
<br>
domain.  I want to quickly outline what those communities are, but I am 
<br>
going to eschew labels for just a moment, because labels sometimes have 
<br>
undesirable connotations.  So here they are:
<br>
<p>COMMUNITY (A)
<br>
<p>Those who would understand completely if you started discussing 
<br>
&quot;Shiffrin and Schneider&quot;, or &quot;Levels of Processing Theory&quot;, or &quot;Deep 
<br>
Dyslexia.&quot;  They would also what a word-exhange error, a 
<br>
morpheme-exchange error or a semantic substitution was.  They would 
<br>
understand the power-law of skill acquisition.  They would know about 
<br>
&quot;Smith and Medin&quot; if you asked them for their thoughts about classical, 
<br>
prototype and feature theories of concepts, and what the current think 
<br>
was on those issues, they might not be able to answer immediately, but 
<br>
they would know what you were asking for, and would be able track it 
<br>
down pretty quickly.  And if you mentioned &quot;motivation&quot;, &quot;compulsion&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;obsession&quot; or &quot;pleasure&quot; they would assume you were just using these as 
<br>
shorthand for certain mechanisms, rather than assuming you were talking 
<br>
dualist philosophy.
<br>
<p>COMMUNITY (B)
<br>
<p>Those who know how to write serious amounts of LISP, who understand 
<br>
pruning algorithms in state-space search, and who know the difference 
<br>
between Blackboards, GAs, and neural nets.  They might well be able to 
<br>
tell you about &quot;unification&quot; in Prolog, and be able to give you a 
<br>
thoughtful discussion of the differences between John Koza's genetic 
<br>
programming and genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming.  They 
<br>
would definitely know about goal hierarchies and planning systems.
<br>
<p>COMMUNITY (C)
<br>
<p>Those to whom the term &quot;edge of chaos&quot; is not just something they 
<br>
learned from James Gleick.  These people are comfortable with the idea 
<br>
that mathematics is a fringe activity that goes on at the tractable edge 
<br>
of a vast abyss of completely intractable systems and equations.  When 
<br>
they use the term &quot;non-linear&quot; they don't mean something that is not a 
<br>
straight line, nor are they talking about finding tricks that yield 
<br>
analytic solutions to certain nonlinear equations.  They are equally 
<br>
comfortable talking about a national economy and a brain as a &quot;CAS&quot; and 
<br>
they can point to meaningful similarities in the behavior of these two 
<br>
sorts of system.  Almost all of these people are seriously well versed 
<br>
in mathematics, but unlike the main body of mathematicians proper, they 
<br>
understand the limitations of analytic attempts to characterize systems 
<br>
in the real world.
<br>
<p>COMMUNITY (D)
<br>
<p>Those who have had the kind of experience in which they find themselves 
<br>
fifty levels deep in a debugger, working on Final Candidate 7 of a piece 
<br>
of software comprising 4000 source files of C and C++, in a hopeless 
<br>
attempt to troubleshoot problems in a codebase that they have only 
<br>
written tiny parts of, and in which the rest is mostly undocumented and 
<br>
barely commented (by people who often did not have much English), with 
<br>
the product due to ship in two weeks.  An experience that bears about as 
<br>
much relationship to a computer science degree as Mrs Featherstone's 
<br>
Finishing School For Young Ladies does to a whorehouse.
<br>
<p>COMMUNITY (E)
<br>
<p>Those who could give you a reasonable account of where Penrose, Chalmers 
<br>
and Dennett would stand with respect to one another.  They could easily 
<br>
distinguish the Hard Problem from other versions of the consciousness 
<br>
issue, even if they might disagree with Chalmers about the conclusion to 
<br>
be drawn.  They know roughly what supervenience is.  The could certainly 
<br>
distinguish functionalism (various breeds thereof) from epiphenomenalism 
<br>
and physicalism, and they could talk about what various camps thought 
<br>
about the issues of dancing, inverted and absent qualia.
<br>
<p>COMMUNITY (F)
<br>
<p>Those who know enough about real neural hardware to think that there are 
<br>
serious questions about whether the real computation takes place in 
<br>
floods of junk in a synaptic cleft or in specific timings of incoming 
<br>
spikes in the dendritic tree.  They know about programmed cell death and 
<br>
how that might relate to learning.  They might know about the 
<br>
Hodgkin-Huxley equations.  They understand what Marr had to say about 
<br>
the possible role of Purkinje cells in fine motor control, and they 
<br>
would know way too much about the architectural features of the brain.
<br>
<p>************************************************************
<br>
<p>Now, some of these communities are more directly hands-on, while some 
<br>
just watch and comment and contribute from afar, but the six different 
<br>
language that they speak and the six different paradigms they bring to 
<br>
the table are all in some way relevant to the task of understanding how 
<br>
cognitive systems might work, and how we might go about building an AI.
<br>
<p>But the problem is that you can go into one of these communities and 
<br>
find very talented people who are completely ignorant of what is going 
<br>
on in the others.  Often, it is not just ignorance but actual scorn and 
<br>
disdain, as if they are proud not to know what is happening elsewhere, 
<br>
because they regard the ideas (and sometimes the people) in some of 
<br>
those other communities as irrelevant or stupid.  Frequently, people 
<br>
have a smattering of some other field and think that they therefore know 
<br>
it all.
<br>
<p>A couple of examples:
<br>
<p>I have watched a well-known cognitive scientist/psychologist give a talk 
<br>
at a conference in which he drew a weird kind of neural net that he 
<br>
claimed solved a big outsanding issue in the community.  Other people in 
<br>
the audience were lavish with their praise at the end of the talk, but I 
<br>
had to stand up and try to explain to him that if we picked apart the 
<br>
assumptions in his model, the hidden nodes in his net would have to 
<br>
number approximately one for every distinct sequence of experiences in 
<br>
the individual's lifetime, and each node would have to be totally 
<br>
connected to every other.  Does anyone here want to do a back of the 
<br>
envelope calculation on that one?  What happened, when I said this, was 
<br>
that the guy could not understand what I was saying - he didn't try to 
<br>
dispute my calculations, he did not *understand* how to derive the 
<br>
number of neuron sets implied by his model.  Nor did anyone else in the 
<br>
audience, except for a couple of shy postgrads who talked about it 
<br>
privately later.  All the professionals in the audience thought I was 
<br>
being an asshole.
<br>
<p>I have listened to a well-known neuroscientist bombard his audience with 
<br>
a 30-minute summary of the entire structure of the brain and what role 
<br>
the various bits played in all aspects of cognition.  Afterwards I tried 
<br>
to ask him why, if we accepted his proposal that consciousness was 
<br>
located in the LGN (or wherever he proposed to situate it that day), 
<br>
this would have any bearing whatsoever on philosophical issues like 
<br>
qualia, as opposed to just the mundane being-awake issues.  Every one of 
<br>
his responses indicated that he could not understand the difference 
<br>
between qualia issues and being-awake issues (what is nowadays called 
<br>
the Hard vs Non-Hard problems).  He *did* claim to resolve the qualia 
<br>
problem, it was just that he talked as if qualia were just a matter of 
<br>
the system being awake, as opposed to asleep.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>If there is anyone here on this list who can say that they have a good 
<br>
grasp of all of the six categories above, could you please email me so I 
<br>
can get a headcount?  I assumed (foolishly, in retrospect) that most 
<br>
would say yes.  Now I think maybe not that many.
<br>
<p>Could you consider the fact that, even if you *are* a person who is 
<br>
fully conversant in all of these, it is not enough for there to be just 
<br>
one such person working in isolation ..... that it should be an 
<br>
absolutely basic requirement of anyone working in the AI field that they 
<br>
can switch comfortably between all of these six paradigms and draw 
<br>
meaningful connections between them?
<br>
<p>Does anyone understand that so long as people live in these separate, 
<br>
hermetically sealed intellectual compartments, the field of AI is going 
<br>
to get nowhere?
<br>
<p>To be sure, confined within a compartment, any given individual could 
<br>
spend their entire life not challenging their own worldview, talking 
<br>
only to people who agree with them and who are willing to tell them that 
<br>
it is okay to refer to others as people who &quot;just don't get it&quot;.  But 
<br>
then, strangely, that individual might get to the end of a long and 
<br>
frustrating career and wonder why it was that that dream AI design 
<br>
didn't quite ever seem to work, although it always seemed so close...
<br>
<p><p><p>I have seen closed-minded cognitive scientists who think AI people are 
<br>
just engineers who play with fantasy toys, and who are willing to call 
<br>
any paltry little algorithm &quot;intelligent&quot;.
<br>
<p>I have seen closed-minded AI people who think that cognitive scientists 
<br>
just fantasize about how the mind works, but never try to actually build 
<br>
anything that works.
<br>
<p>I have seen closed-minded philosophers who invent computationally 
<br>
idiotic thought-experiments and then claim to be able to prove that AI 
<br>
people are idiots.
<br>
<p>I have seen closed-minded software engineers who think that AI people 
<br>
just play with toy systems and don't know dick about building real 
<br>
oftware - and who also think &quot;psychology&quot; is what shrinks do.
<br>
<p>I have seen closed-minded neuroscientists trying to tell cognitive 
<br>
scientists that their fMRI machine has found the part of the brain that 
<br>
is responsible for sarcasm, and then dismiss the cognitive scientists as 
<br>
fools when they say &quot;Oh really?&quot;.
<br>
<p>But then, by contrast, I have to say that most of the Complex Systems 
<br>
folks are extremely accepting and rarely closed-minded.  But they tend 
<br>
to spend their time making connections between different fields rather 
<br>
than settling down to apply their skills in one area, so they tend not 
<br>
to acquire depth in the other five of the above fields.
<br>
<p>CONCLUSION
<br>
<p>We need a revolution here, folks.
<br>
<p>We need people from the various communities who are willing to get 
<br>
together and seriously educate themselves in the other fields without 
<br>
feeling like this is some threat to their egos.
<br>
<p>Or, failing that, we need those who can't change to step aside and let a 
<br>
new, unpolluted-by-prejudice generation step in and start getting some 
<br>
real AI-construction done.
<br>
<p><p><p>This is a prelude to amore lengthy work, so in due course an expanded 
<br>
version will be available.  For anyone that cares.
<br>
<p>Meanhile, I don't want to debate the above in this forum.  You can't 
<br>
debate issues that touch people's core paradigmatic commitments.  Read 
<br>
Kuhn or Feyerabend to understand why.
<br>
