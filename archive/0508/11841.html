<p>Okay, I'm not really sure what you were trying to say after that first
<br>
sentence. Perhaps &quot;Since 'There are exploits' is a very vague claim, and 'there
<br>
are ninja hippos' is a very specific claim, the former claim has a higher
<br>
probability.&quot; I don't want to attack this claim, because I'm not sure its yours.
<br>
Care to clarify?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Distant ninja hippos are of little relevance to our planning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, so while the probability may be high, the probability times 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implication (impact on utility of actions) is low.  The implications are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also not well defined, and there is little reason for thinking that they can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be defined, so the thought experiment fails in a manner parallel to Pascal's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wager.  
</em><br>
<p>Okay, points:
<br>
<p>1. Since I take &quot;implication&quot; to be &quot;what would happen if X were the case,&quot; I
<br>
define the implication of ninja hippos as follows: they will kick all of our
<br>
asses with their awesome ninja skills.
<br>
<p>2. Pascal's wager is claimed to fail in a number of different ways. See:
<br>
<p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/</a>
<br>
<p>3. As is probably obvious from a mildly charitable reading of my emails, I
<br>
didn't mean distant ninja hippos. I meant ninja hippos hiding in your closet,
<br>
or something similarly relevant-if-it-were-the-case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the Kolmogorov complexity of a god or a ninja hippo which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants you to do X (e.g. one which changes the utility implications of any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular behavior in any particular way) is roughly constant across the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space of possible values of X, and since we have no Bayesian valid evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for updating our priors, nor any way of gaining such evidence, our rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior does not differ from what it would be if ninja hippos did exist.
</em><br>
<p>So if a fear satisfies these three conditions, we ought not to worry about it.
<br>
Now, the last two conditions are just to say &quot;We are not justified in
<br>
believing in ninja hippos,&quot; and furthermore both support my position on
<br>
exploits, as we have no valid evidence for exploits, and no way of gaining such
<br>
evidence.
<br>
<p>Honestly, as might be expected from my pathetic, substandard rationality, I
<br>
don't know why the first condition has any more than a trivial impact on the
<br>
question, so help me out: suppose that the question about the existence of
<br>
exploits satisfied conditions (2) and (3); that is, we have no evidence for
<br>
exploits, and no way to gain evidence. But suppose that for all boxed AIs
<br>
attempting to find exploits in their boxes who want you to do X (or whatever
<br>
the analagous example would be), their complexity is not constant across
<br>
possible X. Ought we then to believe in exploits? Why?
<br>
<p>Daniel
<br>
<p>PS: I didn't really know what you were getting at with the stuff about
<br>
alchemists and metaphysics. If it's important, please clarify it for me.
<br>
There's no hurry because I'll be out of town for at least three or four days.
