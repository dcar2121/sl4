<p>Oh, sure :-). But I will try to keep it short, since this only has the 
<br>
potential to be relevant to SL4.
<br>
<p>Background:  Star Bridge Systems wanted to build supercomputers out of 
<br>
field programmable gate arrays, because in principle this might allow 
<br>
software to be implemented as circuits, with sets of gates dedicated to 
<br>
individual algorithms, and with the circuits adapting fluidly as the 
<br>
software ran.  Theoretically, this could lead to speedups (for the right 
<br>
kind of software, and especially for massively parallel AI software) 
<br>
that involve silly numbers:  factor of 10,000, for example.
<br>
<p>The Technical Problems:  (a) Mapping software to circuits is an 
<br>
extremely hard problem.  (b) Understanding the actual mechanics of 
<br>
programming real FPGAs is more like art or voodoo than it is like 
<br>
programming.  (c) The FPGA chips are not currently designed to be 
<br>
reprogrammed rapidly, on the fly.  (d) If current FPGAs are used to full 
<br>
capacity, the way that Star Bridge envisaged, they generate prodigious 
<br>
amounts of heat.
<br>
<p>The Spin Machine Problem:  When SBS made their first announcement, they 
<br>
talked as if they had solved or finessed all these problems.  I was 
<br>
invited to go work for them in the spring of 2001, but it took me six 
<br>
months to finally realise that none of these problems had been solved, 
<br>
that people had made some &quot;exaggerations&quot; about the technology that 
<br>
bordered on outright lies, and that some of the problems were not even 
<br>
*understood* by the founder or employees of the company.
<br>
<p>[For amusement value only:  The prototype, that they initially wanted to 
<br>
lease for $26 million, could only be switched on for short periods 
<br>
because one or other of its twin PSUs would burn out with a half-life 
<br>
measured in hours.  The original CEO had previously been a guest of the 
<br>
government for a time.  There were a couple of Gigs of ram on the 
<br>
prototype boards, but all that time, until after I left, they couldn't 
<br>
get the FPGAs to talk to it reliably.  And when you ran your program on 
<br>
the actual hardware, correct functioning depended on whether timing 
<br>
problems would just happen not to be a problem.   Sigh. ].
<br>
<p>I remain hopeful that someone will buy the company, fire the founder and 
<br>
get a gang of competent people in there to work on the actual problems. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is, the company survives on hype and the patronage of powerful 
<br>
entities who throw money at projects they do not understand.
<br>
<p><p>As I said above, this has the potential to be relevant to SL4 because a 
<br>
reconfigurable supercomputer of this sort is urgently needed by the AI 
<br>
community.  The hardware problems (heat) may soon be solvable, with 
<br>
radically new FPGA technologies that are over the horizon, and with the 
<br>
right kind of internal design it might be possible to understand and 
<br>
program the cells reliably.  And meanwhile, the software engineering 
<br>
community would have to do some lateral thinking on the issues involved 
<br>
in real-world parallel programming.
<br>
<p>You will all have to let me know if any of the issues mentioned in that 
<br>
last paragraph are relevant to the SL4 list.  Looks like no, from what I 
<br>
see.
