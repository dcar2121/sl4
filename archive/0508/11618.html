<em>&gt; It seems like the &quot;this&quot; argument just means bringing up a few more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities.
</em><br>
<p>It involves bringing up broader theoretical possibilities, as well as
<br>
specific technical possibilities...
<br>
<p>For instance, quantum physics can be derived from the assumption that
<br>
uncertainty should be quantified using complex-valued probabilities (cf Saul
<br>
Yousseff's work).  Mathematically it seems consistent that there are more
<br>
general physics theories  that use quaternionic and octonionic
<br>
probabilities; and if this kind of understanding were possible, it would
<br>
lead to a lot of interesting phenomena ... which I have some speculations
<br>
about, that I won't go i nto now...
<br>
<p>(This is just one among many examples I could give, and I realize the above
<br>
paragraph doesn't explain much, but is just an allusion...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If all of those possibilities were known to not have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploits (or,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume for the sake of argument that those possibilities do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have exploits):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you still assert that magic is an issue worth worrying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about? It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like you would. If so, then you still have to answer my arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about why I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think it's rational to believe in &quot;magic,&quot; and you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use any of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppositions about incomplete theories of physics.
</em><br>
<p>If physics and science in general seemed more complete than they do, then my
<br>
estimate of the probability of a superhuman AI finding a box-exploit would
<br>
be significantly lower than it is now -- but still not as low as your seems
<br>
to be.
<br>
<p>So you're right.  The argument from the known (empirical and conceptual)
<br>
incompleteness of physics is only PART of my reason for believing a
<br>
superhuman AI could find a box-exploit.  The other part is the part you
<br>
don't agree with, which is a general argument that if X is a lot smarter
<br>
than Y, then X can probably find a way out of any box that Y creates.
<br>
<p>It occurs to me now that it might be possible to prove a mathematical
<br>
theorem to this effect.  One could look at an average over all possible
<br>
physical universes (assuming some probability distribution on them), and
<br>
over all pairs of organisms X and Y within them, then try to prove that &quot;If
<br>
X is much smarter than Y, then X can escape from most boxes Y could create.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, turning the previous paragraph into a real theorem would involve
<br>
formalizing &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;organism&quot; and &quot;box&quot; in useful ways (which we
<br>
have currently only made limited progress towards), and then proving a
<br>
possibly  very hard theorem.  But I submit that if we did prove something
<br>
like this, it would be decent evidence for the &quot;other part&quot; of my reason for
<br>
believing a superhuman Ai could find a box-exploit.
