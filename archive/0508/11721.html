<br>
<em>&gt; I shall conclude my time at SL4 with a brief summary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my theory, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>On the day of your departure [sic], may I step in with my first post and 
<br>
give what I believe to be a cogent response to your many arguments.
<br>
<p>1) You would like morality (and cognition and volition, etc.) to be as 
<br>
tight a system of ideas as physics - where the concepts and laws and 
<br>
equations fit together with such elegant mutual consistency that we can 
<br>
say with some confidence that *this* (physics) is *the* correct account 
<br>
of how the universe is (modulo some fine details that we are still 
<br>
working on).  You would like there to be an extension of physics to 
<br>
cover morality, cognition, volition, etc., and you would like the 
<br>
extension to inherit the universality that we believe we can see in physics.
<br>
<p>2) You go beyond just wanting this, of course:  you say you know it is 
<br>
true and claim to be able to &quot;prove&quot; it.
<br>
<p>3) There are two main problems with your proofs and arguments:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) You make wild assertions about things like the structure of 
<br>
cognition, the structure of cognitive science, consciousness and the 
<br>
philosophical and methodological foundations of physics, but most of the 
<br>
time those assertions are simply wrong.  I cite as evidence:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The 'Relational Theory' (that consciousness arises
</em><br>
<em> &gt; from the interaction of current experience with past
</em><br>
<em> &gt; memories) is not my theory, it's a very well respected
</em><br>
<em> &gt; theory accepted by many cognitive scientists the world
</em><br>
<em> &gt; over.  You need to do some reading my friend.  Start
</em><br>
<em> &gt; here:
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; <a href="http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v4/psyche-4-10-taylor.html">http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/v4/psyche-4-10-taylor.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>I am a cognitive scientist (and, coincidentally, a former student of 
<br>
John Taylor).  This theory is *not* widely accepted.  Au contraire, your 
<br>
discussion of &quot;consciousness&quot; (like Taylor's) is riddled with the kind 
<br>
of confusion that sends philosophers and cognitive scientists tearing up 
<br>
the wall with frustration.
<br>
<p>In a similiar vein, you make assertions about the mechanisms of 
<br>
cognition (e.g., the role played by induction and deduction) and about 
<br>
the extent and truthhood of the knowledge that an AI would have about 
<br>
the world, but your assertions are wildly out of touch with what real 
<br>
cognitive scientists and real philosophers would say they know.  The 
<br>
real picture is much more complex than you imply, and some of your 
<br>
assertions are just plain wrong.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The second problem with your proofs and arguments is a special 
<br>
case of this last point:  you have some serious misunderstandings of 
<br>
what constitutes &quot;proof&quot; in sciences like physics.  You recently 
<br>
confessed that you had been using the word proof rather loosely, but in 
<br>
spite of that confession you continue to behave as if your proofs have 
<br>
the kind force that is only to be found in mathematics.
<br>
<p>Archimedes could produce a proof of the volume of the sphere that can be 
<br>
set out in just a couple of pages of devastatingly beautiful argument, 
<br>
and after reading those two pages I am convinced beyond all doubt that 
<br>
his proof is perfectly true.
<br>
<p>But at the other end of the edifice that is science and mathematics, in 
<br>
the field of complex systems, I know that if I experiment with computer 
<br>
simulations in which large numbers of interacting agents try to trade 
<br>
with one another, try to optimise their local utility functions, and try 
<br>
to develop strategies for improving their behavior, these systems almost 
<br>
always exhibit a cyclical behavior pattern that starts with 
<br>
revolutionary chaos, improves itself rapidly through free-market 
<br>
innovation, then starts to stagnate in an era of monopolistic corruption 
<br>
and finally becomes rigidly authoritarian and sensitive to the slightest 
<br>
little disturbance from the outside, after which they collapse back into 
<br>
revolutionary chaos and start the whole cycle again.  I can *see* these 
<br>
phases, I can observe a number of repeating patterns and nuances within 
<br>
the phases, and give names to them, but these phases and patterns are 
<br>
*emergent properties* of these systems and they *cannot* be derived 
<br>
using analytic mathematics.  I repeat: they will almost certainly never 
<br>
be derivable from analytic mathematics, and only when you understand the 
<br>
depth of that last truth will you begin to comprehend the foolishness of 
<br>
assuming that physics will soon be extending outward to embrace 
<br>
cognitive science, morality and the nature of consciousness.
<br>
<p>For a deeper survey of this last point, start with M Mitchell Waldrop's 
<br>
book &quot;Complexity,&quot; then follow up with Stephen Wolfram's &quot;A New Kind of 
<br>
Science.&quot;
<br>
<p>4) Will there turn out to be something like a &quot;Universal Morality&quot; that 
<br>
all sufficiently advanced intelligences subscribe to?
<br>
<p>Actually, I believe that under the right set of circumstances a form of 
<br>
UM might emerge and be an interesting and profound fact about the 
<br>
universe.  But that is a far cry from saying that we can prove the 
<br>
existence of such a UM.  I would love to say more about this topic, but 
<br>
I'll wait for another opportunity to return to it.
<br>
<p>SUMMARY:  Can we please refrain from fruitless talk of whether morality 
<br>
is provable, and discuss the details of how it might be implemented, or 
<br>
how it might emerge.  Fewer ASSERTIONS, more INVESTIGATION.

<p>British-born, but resident in U.S. since 1995, after marriage.  Located 
<br>
in the vicinity of Ithaca, NY.
<br>
<p>Physics degree (University College London). M.Sc. in Cognition,

Computing and Psychology (University of Warwick).  Unfinished Ph.D. in 
<br>
cognitive science (still in progress, when I can build or procure the

tools that will make it possible).  Specialisation:  the mechanisms of 
<br>
concept learning and deployment in massively parallel systems.
<br>
<p>Extensive work as software engineer (part of my brain is in CorelDraw, 
<br>
Dreamweaver and that HP All-in-One printer-scanner-fax machine on your 
<br>
desk).  Mostly Macintosh.
<br>
<p>One time Director of Research at Star Bridge Systems, a dysfunctional 
<br>
supercomputer company out of Salt Lake City.
<br>
<p>Writing a book about the Singularity.  Working on software tools that 
<br>
will enable advanced AI systems to be built and studied.
<br>
<p>I consider myself equal parts cognitive scientist / software engineer / 
<br>
philosopher.
