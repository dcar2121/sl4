Hello,
<br>
<p>I have been reading the SL4 list for some time now.  I have repeatedly seen
<br>
people (mostly Mark Geddes but sometimes others) use the phrase &quot;Objective
<br>
Morality&quot;.
<br>
<p>For a list which is supposed to be humanities best hope, I find this highly
<br>
disconcerting.  The phrase &quot;Objective Morality&quot; (sometimes pronounced
<br>
&quot;Universal Morality&quot;) makes as much sense as &quot;colorless green idea&quot;.
<br>
Any statements about it is vacuous.
<br>
<p>Consider it means for a statement to be objective.  It means that a rational
<br>
system using Bayes' Law and reasonable priors (and there are ways of getting
<br>
these!) will arrive at that conclusion that the statement is highly probable
<br>
given the available evidence.
<br>
<p>I encourage you to read Technical Explanation of Technical Explanation:
<br>
<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html</a>
<br>
for the full explanation.
<br>
<p>For example, if you don't believe that the accuracy of Newton's Law of
<br>
Universal Gravitation is objective, observe the moon's orbit.  It very
<br>
accurately matches the theory.  Because this evidence is rather improbable
<br>
given ignorance, but highly probable assuming Universal Gravitation, and
<br>
because the law should have a reasonably high prior, one can safely conclude
<br>
that Newton's law is in fact accurate.
<br>
<p>Now, what about objective morality?  The only way to find out would be by
<br>
testing the morality of some test scenarios.  However, this can not be done
<br>
because performing the test would entail already having some definition of
<br>
morality.
<br>
<p>Naturally, any definition of morality would pass with flying colors if it
<br>
were tested against itself this way!  Thus the likelihood of the evidence is
<br>
the same whether our hypothetical &quot;objective&quot; morality is objective or not.
<br>
The only possible piece of evidence has no strength whatsoever.  &quot;Objective&quot;
<br>
is a complete misnomer for anything with this property.
<br>
<p>Note that I am *not* saying that there is no optimal definition of morality
<br>
for human kind, determinable by Coherent Extrapolated Volition.  I'm simply
<br>
saying that this optimal morality does not have a special place in the grand
<br>
scheme of things and that if we don't try to instantiate it, we won't.
<br>
