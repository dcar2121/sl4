It was once asserted here that if everyone were to simply accept expert 
<br>
consensus their aggregate Bayesianity score would increase.  I'm not sure 
<br>
this is true.  Surely if they accepted expert opinion with 100% certainty it 
<br>
would fall.  How should they choose the certainty with which to accept 
<br>
expert opinion.  Likewise, how should they choose experts?  Dennis would say 
<br>
&quot;take me as the expert&quot; or &quot;chose as experts those who I tell you to&quot;, but 
<br>
that's not the advice I'd give Al Quaida.
<br>
It seems to me that people's implicity acceptance of someone's claims to 
<br>
expertise are reflected in the degree to which they believe that person, and 
<br>
more so in the degree to which they obey that person when convinced that 
<br>
their interests are aligned.  That is part of why, for instance, doctors 
<br>
have so much difficulty convincing people to use preventative medicine.  The 
<br>
doctors complain and blame the patients, but the patients rightly believe, 
<br>
in the pseudo-Bayesian sense of &quot;belief that dictates action&quot;, that the 
<br>
advice of doctors is neither as well aligned with theirs nor as well 
<br>
calibrated with respect to preventative medicine as it is with respect to 
<br>
treatments which provide the doctor with immediate feedback.
<br>
Of course, higher IQ patients *are* more likely to use preventative 
<br>
measures, so in so far as IQ corresponds to rational utility maximizing 
<br>
behavior with moderated (though strong) Heuristics and Biases effects, (as 
<br>
argued by Brian Caplan, search here 
<br>
<a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/">http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/</a>)
<br>
the strength of my argument is weakened.  Much neglect of preventative 
<br>
medicine is surely reflected in Heuristics and Biases behavior.
