<em>&gt; That is not so.  I happen to have some anti-desires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (repugnances) that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are quite strong.  I do not want to become a woman,  do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not want to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gay (no disrespect to transgender/gay folks here:  just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressing my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal feelings about *my* lifestyle choices), and I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repelled by drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I know I *could* in some future world, flip a switch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such a way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I would enjoy being gay, or being a woman.  I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that after I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flipped the switch, I would enjoy it deeply, even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the thought 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes my skin crawl right now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would I flip the switch?  I would be happy to do it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think I can make you see my point of view as
<br>
long as you believe this.  No, either you wouldn't
<br>
flip the switch, or you have some other desires that
<br>
you haven't told us about.
<br>
<p>BTW, people have directed many objections against what
<br>
you've said, and most of them, I don't agree with, so
<br>
don't lump everyone debating you together.  I am
<br>
trying to get across a notion about motivation.  You
<br>
seem to believe that having a system in which motives
<br>
arise in an unplanned way from multiple interactions
<br>
somehow makes those motives subservient to &quot;reason&quot;.
<br>
Your discussion of flipping the switch is meant to show
<br>
that reason can lead one to override these motivations.
<br>
I don't believe that, and I don't believe your example.
<br>
You have no reason to flip the switch, and you have
<br>
reasons not to.  Hence, you would either not flip the
<br>
switch, or you would be acting irrationally, not being
<br>
led to flip it by thought, as you claim.
<br>
<p>You would not flip the switch, except in the service
<br>
of some stronger motive.  Randomness itself could be
<br>
a motive, but you can't seek protection from
<br>
paper-clip maximizers by injecting randomness.
<br>
<p>I think that further analysis would show you have to
<br>
believe in an objective morality like Geddes in order
<br>
for your position to make sense.  I may try to take it
<br>
up later.
