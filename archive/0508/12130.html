<p>This argument is crucial and I believe cannot be overstated; to phrase 
<br>
it in a different way (taken from some comments I made off-list earlier 
<br>
this week): My opinion on the topic is that guaranteeing friendliness in 
<br>
AIs is nearly as impossible as guaranteeing friendliness in humans -- 
<br>
both cases are, in reality, asking for omnipotent control over 
<br>
fundamentally free agents, which is the fancy of philosophers, 
<br>
politicians and military intelligence types. In technical terms, I 
<br>
belive it is impossible to build static or otherwise &quot;invariant&quot; 
<br>
goal-systems into free-agents who are capable of strong 
<br>
self-modification, and that the creation or evolution of such creatures 
<br>
is an inevitability on which we must plan (the only responsible, 
<br>
conservative and prudent course of action). That  being said, I believe 
<br>
it is of prime importance to design, build, experiment with and teach AI 
<br>
systems which have the highest probability of being friendly (i.e. of 
<br>
being creatures of high moral standards), taking care to think hardest 
<br>
about long-term future consequences of particular design and teaching 
<br>
decisions, using primarily empirical knowledge gained from experimentation.
