<p>Point taken; however, I read an interesting essay
<br>
(forget where) on ideology: the author used the
<br>
word 'ideology' in a more expansive and less
<br>
judgmental way than I had ever understood it. The
<br>
simple fact is that nobody could get through the
<br>
day without making an awful lot of assumptions
<br>
about the world around them; as desirable as
<br>
fact-finding and rational analysis are, it's
<br>
impossible to apply this sort of systematic,
<br>
microscopic attention to every activity and
<br>
social interaction in real time, and nobody does.
<br>
Scott Adams deals nicely with this subject toward
<br>
the end of &quot;The Dilbert Future&quot; (a humorous but
<br>
actually rather enlightening book). To illustrate
<br>
how &quot;things could be completely different yet
<br>
look exactly the same&quot; he offers a thought
<br>
experiment: what if gravity doesn't exist, but
<br>
seems to because everything in the universe,
<br>
including us, is expanding? He reports that
<br>
objections to his little theory fall into two
<br>
categories: those that have obvious errors, and
<br>
those filled with equations and concepts he
<br>
claims he can't understand, based on physics
<br>
experiments he can't replicate.
<br>
<p>The situation isn't quite so severe where
<br>
evolution is concerned. Evolution happens all the
<br>
time (that's why this year's flu is not last
<br>
year's flu). Ongoing speciation is observed in
<br>
fish in Africa.
<br>
<p>But what of it? This topic ain't very SL4, hence
<br>
Ben's original apology.
