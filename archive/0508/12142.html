</em><br>
<em>&gt; each frame is closer to the co-ordinate resolution.
</em><br>
<p>These low-speed roundoff errors are dealt with via quantum mechanics.
<br>
<p>In Newtonian physics, different objects have different speeds.
<br>
Say you represent them with floating point.  A low-speed object
<br>
might move at 1.2345*10^-10 m/s.  Its speed is known to within
<br>
10^-14 m/s.  A high-speed object might move at 1.2345*10^8 m/s.
<br>
Its speed is known to within 10^4 m/s.  Suppose you're simulating
<br>
a high-speed spaceships travelling thru the universe.  You only
<br>
know its speed, and the speed of everyone in the spaceship,
<br>
to within 10^4 m/s or so.  You're unable to simulate
<br>
what's happening on board the spaceship.
<br>
<p>In special relativity, everything moves through time-space at the
<br>
speed of light.  Each object's velocity is specified by a direction
<br>
vector in time-space.  Interactions between objects with the same
<br>
relative speeds can always be calculated with the same degree of
<br>
accuracy.  I think.
