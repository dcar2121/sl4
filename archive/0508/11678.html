<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That's incorrect : Objective != Universal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Universal means that the same morality applies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; universally (i.e. for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone) whereas Objective means that for any

<em>&gt; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; person their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; morality is an objective fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To clarify, 'Universal Morality' is what I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always meant.  I think there's a set of moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles applicable to all sentients in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; multiverse at all times.  This background set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles goes beyond mere 'Volition' (what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I realize now that I did gloss over a few of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the differences between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objective and Universal Morality, but my argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes both of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts meaningless anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Tennessee Leeuwenburg seems to define them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective morality is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim by some person that their personal morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an objective fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereas universal morality claims that there some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality out there which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applies universally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you meant something else by either of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms, feel free to clarify.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does one find out whether a morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;applying universally.&quot;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already showed that no experiment will do the trick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Thus that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningless too, as there is no way to find out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which morality is universal.
</em><br>
<p>Rubbish.  Plenty of  physics concepts are supposed to
<br>
'apply universally'.  That doesn't stop us  assigning
<br>
rational probabilities to supposed 'universals' on the
<br>
basis of finite evidence.  Rationality is a process of
<br>
assessing competing *explanations* to see which works
<br>
best.  To treat Universal Morality scientifically we
<br>
would simply form multiple hypotheses about sentient
<br>
behaviour and use 'inference to the best explanation'
<br>
to cut down the space of probability by selecting the
<br>
hypothesis with the best explanatory power, just as we
<br>
do for every other branch of science.   
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Physics isn't Psychology.
</em><br>
<p>Are you sure?  Objective Idealism treats physics as a
<br>
form of cognition you know.  How can something be said
<br>
to exist at all if it wasn't being *interpreted* by
<br>
some sort of cognitive proccess?  Everything you know
<br>
about the world requires a mental model to be
<br>
comprehended you realize?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Laws of the Universe are simple and pretty as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as we can tell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The human brain is a hodge podge of layered complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function adaptations, most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which are set up to deal with medium sized things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for medium length times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the plains of Africa.  Given that the brain was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made by a blind watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maker who cares far less about consistency than even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft, what makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you expect there to be underlying principles?
</em><br>
<p>Did I mention the *human* mind specifically ?  No.  I
<br>
was talking about *sentient minds in general*.
<br>
<p>Abstract out all the arbitrary hodge podge features of
<br>
the human brain and look *only* at the *neccessery*
<br>
features - the general properties of the brain
<br>
required for rationality and self-awareness.  Since
<br>
brains run on physical laws, there should be general
<br>
principles that apply to all sentients.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Take 'Values' on the one hand, and 'Intelligence'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (ability to make predictions on the other).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If it really were the case that you could have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; super-smart intelligence with any old value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that would mean that it would be impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; combinedValues and Intelligence into a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explanatory framework.  This goes against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we know about the fundamental *explanatory* unity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cosmos.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, human values and human intelligence are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are the products of complex functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptations.
</em><br>
<p>Again, did I mention *human* values and *human*
<br>
intelligence specifically.  No.  I was talking about
<br>
Values and Intelligence *in general*.  
<br>
<p>Consciousness, Values and Intelligence *are*
<br>
fundamental properties of the cosmos that need to be
<br>
explained.  Humans are not the only beings that can be
<br>
conscious, have intelligence and have values.
<br>
<p>And as I pointed out above, if you abstract out all
<br>
the hodge-podge features, you'd be left with the
<br>
general features common to all sentients.  You can't
<br>
just throw brains together willy-nilly.  There are
<br>
common physical principles required for brains to work
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are not defining Universal as all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity, which would make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Collective, what or who do you even mean by it?  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are postulating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deity, it might really be time for somebody to call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list sniper.
</em><br>
<p>I never mentioned a deity.    Read what I say.  I
<br>
clearly defined 'Universal' as something held in
<br>
common *by all logically possible sentients*.  This is
<br>
clearly different from a Collective.  See the
<br>
difference:
<br>
<p>Collective:  Something defined by reference to all
<br>
*currently* existing sentients in some context
<br>
<p>Universal:  Something deifned by reference to all
<br>
*logically possible* sentients.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As I said earlier, I think the foundation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *not* individual (or even collective) Volition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *Self-Actualization* - becoming more aware of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nature.  And our 'true nature' is the objective,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universal principles underpinning self-awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cognition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I get Enlightened when I become truly aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hodge podge that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human brain?  I seriously doubt it.  If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really about knew all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kludges and piled up lies that the brain uses to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplish its evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business would we really be all that happy?  On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary, I suspect it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would offend our moral sensibilities, and make us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to move out of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wetware and become truly decent people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -=+Marcello Mathias Herreshoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Again, read what I say!   I said you get enlightened
<br>
by learning about your *true* nature, not every part
<br>
of your nature.  I defined your *true* nature to be
<br>
only that small part of yourself which is *universal*
<br>
- i.e common to all logically possible sentients.
<br>
<p>Again, ignore all the kludges and hodge-potch features
<br>
of your mind.  These are not part of your true nature
<br>
as I have defined it here.
<br>
<p>Which parts of your mind enable you to be self-aware,
<br>
to reason and to be altruistic?  *These* are your true
<br>
nature.  All the other evolutionary kludges are just fluff.
