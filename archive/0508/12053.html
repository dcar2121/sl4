<p>
Rather than get in it with the &quot;What's IA&quot;
<br>
thread, I already done went to the SL4 glossary
<br>
wiki to find out for myself. Whilst reading the
<br>
other acronyms, I came across MITECS, which I
<br>
don't recall being sufficiently mentioned in
<br>
prior threads, so I post the wiki entry (all that
<br>
follows is writ by Eliezer) for others who may
<br>
not already know of it:

[MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences],
<br>
edited by Wilson and Keil
<br>
<p>I desperately wanted this book five years before
<br>
it even existed. It's a good thing that this book
<br>
was published in 1999, because if I had found
<br>
this book in 1999 and learned that it had been
<br>
available since 1994, I would have run amok with
<br>
a flamethrower. Somewhere in this book is a short
<br>
summary of almost every subject in cognitive
<br>
science that I've ever been interested in. Some
<br>
hint of the vast depth of the field of cognitive
<br>
science can be gained by reading an entire book
<br>
whose concepts are summarized in a two-page
<br>
article in MITECS, then realizing that MITECS has
<br>
471 articles. Not that MITECS is a shallow book:
<br>
If 90% of the usefulness comes from 10% of the
<br>
information, then this book tries to give you 40%
<br>
of the usefulness with 1% of the information, and
<br>
often succeeds. And MITECS is enormously powerful
<br>
in combination with Google. MITECS tells you that
<br>
there's something you need to know about, and
<br>
Google hunts down online research papers.
<br>
<p>The price Amazon currently quotes is $165, but I
<br>
bought mine for $90 at our local Microcenter. Is
<br>
it worth it? Definitely. If you want to become a
<br>
cognitive scientist, there is no other book on
<br>
Earth that will move you closer to this goal, not
<br>
even Gödel, Escher, Bach. If you have to choose
<br>
either a college curriculum in cognitive science
<br>
or reading MITECS cover to cover, pick MITECS.&quot;
<br>
<p>Guess I better look for one too...
