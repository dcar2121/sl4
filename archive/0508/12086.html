</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, and it would be meaningless to assert that it would still be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to a modified or augmented form of the original goal
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; SOMEONE ELSE) You still haven't given any arguments to support your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contention.
</em><br>
<p>If you are saying that if you take a system that is designed to
<br>
fulfill goals, and you give it a rich environment, lots of rules,
<br>
and lots of other knowledge, that its code will somehow magically
<br>
run in ways that one would predict to be theoretically impossible
<br>
from the code, then you are wrong.  I hope that's not what you're
<br>
saying.  You're not saying, for instance, that a sufficiently
<br>
complex computer can solve the halting problem?  Or that a very
<br>
complex program running in protected mode can, by virtue of its
<br>
complexity (rather than by virtue of a very specific exploit),
<br>
operate in real mode?  Or that a program whose main loop guarantees
<br>
that each operator is chosen in a way that will minimize some
<br>
value, will actually act so as to maximize that value?  Or that
<br>
invariants in the code will vary?
<br>
<p>If you're saying that it will be hard to predict what this complex
<br>
system will do, that's not a contention, because no one will contend
<br>
with that statement.
<br>
<p>I suppose you're trying to assert something between these extremes,
<br>
but I can't figure out what.
<br>
<p>I think you need to be more specific about
<br>
what you mean by &quot;complex systems theory&quot;.  There isn't a
<br>
&quot;complex systems theory&quot; in the way that there is an &quot;evolutionary
<br>
theory&quot;; there is a set of principles and a set of tools,
<br>
and a whole heap of data and anecdotes.
<br>
<p>CST might say things such as
<br>
<p>- a plot of the number of goals of the system vs. the importance of
<br>
those goals would show a power-law distribution
<br>
<p>- there is some critical number of average possible action transitions
<br>
above which the behavior of the system leads to an expansion rather
<br>
than a contraction in state space
<br>
<p>- there is a ratio of exploration of new hypotheses over exploitation
<br>
of confirmed hypotheses, and there are two values for this ratio that
<br>
locate phase shifts between &quot;static&quot;, &quot;dynamic&quot;, and
<br>
&quot;unstable/devolving&quot; modes of operation
<br>
<p>There are no general principles of complex systems that say that
<br>
a system &quot;emerges&quot; into a new state in which the laws from the
<br>
previous state no longer apply.  Evolution and emergent complexity
<br>
don't violate the laws of thermodynamics.  Likewise, a computation,
<br>
no matter how complex the computer, can't violate the laws of
<br>
computation.
<br>
<p>In friendly and respectful debate,
<br>
