<p>
It seems to me that an unpleasent person doing something like what was 
<br>
suggested *would* be valid evidence for the existance of a capricious 
<br>
creator.  However, it is at least plausible that deep understanding of 
<br>
evolution would enable the probability of such a creator to be established 
<br>
as very low indeed.  Even if it wasn't, such a creator would have provided 
<br>
the FAI with no basis for trusting its promise or its threat.  Other than 
<br>
those huge caveats, we have to point out that what we want is a FAI that 
<br>
makes the right decision given the available information, not one which 
<br>
never faces trade-offs or which makes the right decision regardless of 
<br>
information.  Maybe, even given my reasons for thinking otherwise, killing 
<br>
the people with unibrows really is Friendly in such a circumstance.  I would 
<br>
be shocked if it was, but would be convinced that it was if a Friendly RPOP 
<br>
actually did it.  Finally, and importantly, such a scenario is simply not 
<br>
going to happen, and is therefore not worth planning for.
