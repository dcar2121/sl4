<p>There's a clear difference between looking at the
<br>
volitions of only existing sentients in a limited
<br>
context (Collective Volition) and looking at the
<br>
volitions of *all logically possible sentients*.  This
<br>
shows that there are things missing from the CV model.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; So ... the cognitive processes that give rise to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, good isn't a good word to use here, because

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You need to be more specific, perhaps try to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are you trying to tell us about these cognitive

<em>&gt; processes that give 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise to sentience?
</em><br>
<p>I told you over and over.  Re-read.  The cognitive
<br>
proccesses behind Induction and Deduction are good
<br>
because they help us to reason about morality in the
<br>
first place.  No sentient can call them bad without
<br>
self-contradiction (because those very cognitive
<br>
proccesses are required to speak the words 'That's
<br>
bad' at all).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, as a whole separate question, what does this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to do with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Collective Volition document written by Eliezer?
</em><br>
<p>See above.  My definition of UV (Universal Volition)
<br>
shows that there's things missing from the CV model. 
<br>
My pointing out that the cognitive proccesses behind
<br>
Induction and Deduction are open to objective
<br>
experimental testing, and these proccesses are neeeded
<br>
for moral reasoning in the first place shows that
<br>
there's a way to objectively determine values, in
<br>
contradiction to the assumptions behind the CV model.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Here's an axiomatic proof of universal morality, with
<br>
axioms clearly defined, every last step a clear-cut
<br>
logical deduction and backed by references to accepted
<br>
scientific backs and clear-cut examples.
<br>
<p><p>Theorem 1:  If individual or collective volition is
<br>
proposed as the foundation of values, we can still ask
<br>
'Why Volition?'  The justification cannot itself be a
<br>
part of the volitional level.
<br>
<p>Theorem 2:  There's a cognitive level beyond the level
<br>
of either individual or collective volition.  The
<br>
cognitive proccess required for reasoning about
<br>
volition are not themselves a part of the volitional
<br>
level.  
<br>
<p>Theorem 3:  The underlaying cognitive processes are
<br>
open to objective, experimental testing, since
<br>
'cognitive processes' require brains and brains are
<br>
physical objects. 
<br>
<p>Theorem 4:   The level beyond the volitional level is
<br>
open to objective experimental testing.
<br>
<p>Theorem 5:  The basic cognitive processes that enable
<br>
us to reason about volition in the first place are:
<br>
Induction and Deduction.  The basic cognitive process
<br>
that enables a sentient to have 'Volition' in the
<br>
first place is 'Self-Awareness'.  
<br>
<p>Theorem 6:  The mechanisms behind these (Induction,
<br>
Deduction and Self-Awareness) are the real foundation
<br>
for values. 
<br>
<p>Theorem 7:   A sentient cannot consistently make the
<br>
value judgement that 'the cognitive mechanisms behind
<br>
value judgements are bad', since the sentient would be
<br>
contradicting itself - he needs to believe in the
<br>
validity of those very cognitive mechanisms to make
<br>
any value judgements in the first place.
<br>
<p>Theorem 8:  Since (a)  'the cognitive mechanisms
<br>
behind value judgements' are good for making value
<br>
judgements, (b) These mechanisms cannot consistently
<br>
be judged to be 'bad' without contradiction and (c)
<br>
These mechamisms are open to experimental testing, it
<br>
follows that there are at least some value judgements
<br>
that are objective, universl and open to experimental
<br>
testing.  (The value judgements about the merits of
<br>
the cognitive mechanisms behind Induction, Deduction
<br>
and Self-Awareness).
<br>
<p>Theorem 9:  Everything is computation.  (There is good
<br>
evidence that this is true from current scientific
<br>
knowledge and the theory of universal computation).
<br>
<p>Theorem 10:  Since everything is computation, any
<br>
finite  physical proccess in reality could *in
<br>
principle* be represented as a computation with 100%
<br>
accuracy.
<br>
<p>Theorem 11:  Brains are computational (Supported by
<br>
all known biological evidence along with above
<br>
arguments).
<br>
<p>Theorem 12:  Since all cognitive processes require
<br>
brains (supported by all known scientific evidence) ,
<br>
all cognitive processes are computational.
<br>
<p>Theorem 13:  Since (a) All physical processes are
<br>
computational  (b) All cognitive processes are
<br>
computational, (c) All general computers are logicaly
<br>
equivalent (follows from the theory of universal
<br>
computation), it follows that all physical processes
<br>
could *in principle* by represented by a cognitive
<br>
process with 100% accuracy.
<br>
<p>Theorem 14:  From the above, it follows that *some*
<br>
super-intelligence with the right mental make-up could
<br>
*in principle* represent  any finite physical process
<br>
as a 'conscious thought' in its mind which would be a
<br>
100% accurate representation of said physical
<br>
processes
<br>
<p>Theorem 15:  From previous arguments, since any
<br>
physical process could *in principle* be represented
<br>
with 100% accuracy as a 'conscious thought' in the
<br>
mind of *some* super-intelligence, it follows that
<br>
*any physical process* is EQUIVALENT to *a thought*. 
<br>
<p>(The fact that the said super-intelligence could not
<br>
know with certainty that he does in fact have a
<br>
perfect mental representation of some physical process
<br>
is not relevant to this argument).  
<br>
<p>Theorem 16:  From previous arguments, any physical
<br>
process in reality is equivalent to a thought.  From
<br>
the theory of materialism (backed by all known
<br>
scientific evidence) everything can be understand as a
<br>
physical process.  Therefore everything in reality
<br>
could also be understood as a 'thought'.
<br>
<p>Theorem 17:  All 'thoughts' require the underlaying
<br>
cognitive processes behind them - Induction and
<br>
Deduction.
<br>
<p>Theorem 18:  From previous arguments anything in
<br>
reality could be represented as a thought and
<br>
therefore *anything in reality* (desks, rocks, chairs)
<br>
could be represented as equivalent to the mental
<br>
proccesses needed for the representation (Induction,
<br>
Deduction ).
<br>
<p>Theorem 19:  From Theorems 1-8 it was established that
<br>
objective value judgments about the cognitive
<br>
proccesses behind Induction and Deduction are
<br>
possible.  It was shown that objective value
<br>
judgements can be made about the merits of the
<br>
cognitive processes behind Induction and Deduction.
<br>
<p>Theorem 20:  Theorems 9-18 established that ANY THING
<br>
IN REALITY (rocks, chairs, tables etc) can be
<br>
represented as a 'thought', and therefore anything in
<br>
reality can be represented as the Cognitive proccesses
<br>
of Induction and Deduction.
<br>
<p>Theorem 21:  From theorem 19-20, since (a) objective
<br>
value judgements about the merits of the cognitive
<br>
processes behind Induction and Deduction are possible
<br>
and (b) ANY THING IN REALITY can be represented as
<br>
part of said mental processes (Induction, Deduction)
<br>
it follows that objective value judgements can be made
<br>
about ANY THING IN REALIY.
<br>
<p>The case for objective morality is proved.
