<p>
<em>&gt; this is *not* a creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking itself &quot;what feels good to me?&quot;, it is a creature that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already jumped up a level from that question and is asking itself &quot;what,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among the infinite possibilities, are the kind of experiences that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to *become* pleasurable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This moment - when this particular thought occurs to the first AI we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build - will be THE hinge point in the history of the solar system
</em><br>
<p>I understand the importance of this point in history, yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest that, at this point, the creature will realise something that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fact, we can also know if we think about it carefully enough, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that the infinite landscape of possible motivations divides into two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes, in much the same way that infinite series of numbers divide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into two classes:  those that converge and those that diverge.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference is this:  the universe contains fragile, low-entropy things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called sentient beings (including itself) which are extraordinarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rare.  It also contains vast quantities of high-entropy junk, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common as muck and getting more so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The creature will know that some motivation choices (paperclipization,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axe-murdering, and also, most importantly, total amorality) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divergent:  they have the potential, once implemented and switched on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to so thoroughly consume the AI that there will be a severe danger that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will deliberately or accidentally, sooner or later, cause the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snuffing out of all sentience.  Choosing, on the other hand, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement a sentience-compassion module, which then governs and limits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all future choices of motivation experiments is convergent:  it pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much guarantees that it, at least, will not be responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminating sentience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, ask yourself again which of these two choices it would make.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but your &quot;good&quot; branch divides into a number of sub-branches, including
<br>
<p>1) one in which the AI programs itself to act in a way that is
<br>
close-to-guaranteed to keep ITSELF alive and rational and acting in such a
<br>
way as to continue creating interesting new patterns
<br>
<p>2) one in which the AI programs itself to do the above, but also to preserve
<br>
and protect other sentiences
<br>
<p>You haven't given an argument as to why the AI would choose 2 over 1, for
<br>
example (among the many other possibilities)
