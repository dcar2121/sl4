<em>&gt; Now, some of these communities are more directly hands-on, while some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just watch and comment and contribute from afar, but the six different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language that they speak and the six different paradigms they bring to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the table are all in some way relevant to the task of understanding how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive systems might work, and how we might go about building an AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the problem is that you can go into one of these communities and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find very talented people who are completely ignorant of what is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on in the others.
</em><br>
<p><p>Ahem...  One thing that is fairly obvious from reading your list of six
<br>
communities, is that there are a fair number of people on this list doing
<br>
serious research who very arguably do not fall under any of the categories
<br>
you invented.  That you are not aware of the fact that there is at least a
<br>
seventh or eighth community strongly represented on this list suggests that
<br>
you may be guilty of the very problem you outline in the last sentence
<br>
above.
<br>
<p><p>One thing that you (and others) may be missing is that this list has been
<br>
around a long time, and that the ideas from many of the communities you
<br>
mention above have been thoroughly vetted and mostly discarded.  The list is
<br>
pretty quiet these days, ignoring the recent flurry, but there was quite a
<br>
bit of merciless discussion and analysis of theory in the early years.
<br>
Old-timers are not going to be so keen on re-living old battles.
<br>
<p>I daresay that you have at least some gaping holes in your understanding of
<br>
the spaces that are considered baseline knowledge on this list for the sake
<br>
of constructive argument.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Could you consider the fact that, even if you *are* a person who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully conversant in all of these, it is not enough for there to be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one such person working in isolation ..... that it should be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely basic requirement of anyone working in the AI field that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can switch comfortably between all of these six paradigms and draw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful connections between them?
</em><br>
<p><p>Could you consider the possibility that many of us have taken everything of
<br>
value from these six paradigms and discarded the lot of them?  All six of
<br>
those paradigms (such as they are) are b0rken for various reasons as far as
<br>
I'm concerned, and not because I am ignorant of them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; CONCLUSION
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We need a revolution here, folks.
</em><br>
<p><p>You are a little late to the party.  You might want to familiarize yourself
<br>
with the theoretical history of this list.  There is still a diverse range
<br>
of opinion on this list regarding fundamental design theory, but you appear
<br>
to have pigeonholed everyone on the list without any idea of where people on
<br>
this list actually stand theoretically.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers,
<br>
