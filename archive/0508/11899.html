<em>&gt; Marc,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do understand your basic point, I think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're saying that anything in objective reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be contained within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subjective reality of a hypothetical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently powerful mind.
</em><br>
<p>Yes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you're saying that anything contained in a mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is constructed according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to certain cognitive principles, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles of deductive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inductive reasoning.
</em><br>
<p>Right
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This second point is a bit confusing, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; induction and deduction are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedures of inference not methods of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *representation*.  However, one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that inductive and deductive reasoning are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes a mind would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use to figure out a compact representation of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity.  In that sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can perhaps associate an entity with a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inductive and deductive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning steps.  Is this what you mean, or am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missing something?  
</em><br>
<p>That's (roughly) what I meant yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give me an example of how you intend inductive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deductive processes to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used for knowledge representation?
</em><br>
<p>(See below)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Next, you're saying that chains of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deductive/inductive reasoning can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningfully assessed via various valuation methods.
</em><br>
<p>Um... yes.  I'm saying that valuation (value
<br>
judgements) are *implicit* in the very processes of
<br>
induction and deduction themselves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  And you're saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order for a mind to trust in its own reasoning at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, it must accept the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposition in the former sentence -- if not, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its reasoning would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untrustworthy from its own point of view.
</em><br>
<p>Right 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, ultimately, you're arguing that if any mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusts its own reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes, then this mind can assess the &quot;value&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an entity in objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality via assessing the value of the chain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive processes it uses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reconstruct this entity within its own mind (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would use to do so, if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had the memory/processing power).
</em><br>
<p>Right!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think this kind of argumentation deserves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the label &quot;Theorem&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should really be reserved for statements proved with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical rigor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that is a stylistic point and if you don't agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with me, that's your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, obviously.
</em><br>
<p>O.K.  I was using 'theorem' in an informal sense to
<br>
simply mean 'reasoning step'.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't really see what this has to do with ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or morality, though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, as you say, I can try to assess the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cognitive processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would use to reconstruct the Holocaust within my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind if I had more memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and processing power.  But, I don't see how this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much deeper than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying (for example) &quot;Yes, there is a universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality, because we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model the universe as a computer, so everything in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe is made of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits, and we can define the value of X as the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of bits in X.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Ben G
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The value of X is not *the number of bits in X*.  That
<br>
would be a very crude definition of value!
<br>
<p>I'd say that the value of X would be *how close the
<br>
inductive and deductive procedures used to represent X
<br>
in ones mind came to 'optimal' induction and deduction
<br>
in the given domain of knowledge which is X is classed
<br>
under*.  
<br>
<p>Let me give an example.  Suppose a super-intelligence
<br>
was trying to objectivity determine the aesthetic
<br>
value of a painting.  To simplify the example I'll
<br>
consider only the aesthetic value of the *design* (i.e
<br>
the visual-spatial patterns).  I'll also only look at
<br>
Induction here.
<br>
<p>Assume the super-intelligence can form a complete
<br>
conscious representation of the painting (i.e the
<br>
design is captured in complete detail i.e. to the
<br>
limits of artistic resolution)
<br>
<p>To recognize spatial patterns in the first place the
<br>
sentient has to carry out the Inductive procedure of
<br>
'pattern recognition'.  
<br>
<p>To apply my system, the sentient determines how close
<br>
the inductive procedures used to recognize all the
<br>
patterns making up the painting came to the 'optimally
<br>
efficient'.   An 'optimal' procedure for inducting
<br>
spatial patterns is one that that would be 'optimally
<br>
efficient' in the sense of the most compact
<br>
representation.  The 'objective aesthetic value' would
<br>
simply be this figure.
<br>
<p>For example:  A painting with spatial patterns
<br>
displaying a high level of 'symmetry' could be more
<br>
'optimally represented' because the inductive
<br>
procedures used to recognize the patterns making up
<br>
the painting enable the sentient to compress the data
<br>
more readily (i.e Patterns with high levels of
<br>
Symmetry are 'good' for induction).  
<br>
<p>In fact 'Symmetry' is needed in *some* degree for any
<br>
induction to occur at all.  The degree to which
<br>
perceptual data about spatial patterns can compressed
<br>
depends on the amount of symmetry.  So one could
<br>
conjecture that 'Symmetry' is an aesthetic property of
<br>
spatial patterns which is 'objectively good'.
<br>
<p>i.e The properties of spatial patterns are 'good'
<br>
which enable cognitive procedures to recognize spatial
<br>
patterns in the first place.
<br>
<p>One could run through all the knowledge domains
<br>
looking for this tautological sounding property and
<br>
thus a way to objectivity assign value could be
<br>
established.
<br>
<p>i.e  Property X in domain Y is 'objectivity good' when
<br>
it is a neccessery condition the cognitive recognition
<br>
and represention procedures require to carry out
<br>
recognition and representation in the first place.
<br>
<p>Example:  Property 'Symmetry' in domain 'Spatial
<br>
Patterns' is objectivity good because *some* degree of
<br>
symmetry is required for any induction (data
<br>
compression) to occur at all.
<br>
<p>For instance, check out my table of :
<br>
'Universal Utilities' that I posted on the SL4 Wiki.
<br>
<p>I ran through my 7 'core' knowledge domains 
<br>
(Mind, Morality, Models, Meaning, Mentality, Measure
<br>
and Matter) and for each domain I searched for general
<br>
'values' which take the form explained above.  I was
<br>
thus able to come up with what I believe to be 21
<br>
'objectivity good' values which form my Universal
<br>
Value System.
<br>
