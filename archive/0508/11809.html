Hi Daniel, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I'm not talking about the magic of sweet talking the jailer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into letting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI out. That's another question. I was talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief aired by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of members of this list that there is reason to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that features of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the laws of physics might be exploited by a boxed AI. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, Goertzel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seemed to suggest that he believed an AI might be able to use quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleportation to escape the box. Perhaps I am misrepresenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this a fair example of the kind of belief that many people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list hold.
</em><br>
<p>I'm currently vacationing in a fairly undeveloped area and only have email
<br>
access every few days so I can't take part in a dialogue right now.
<br>
<p>However, since I've been mentioned I'll chip in a little bit here...
<br>
<p>My statement was that I believe an AI with superhuman intelligence may well
<br>
be able to find SOME method for escaping from a box we think is impregnable.
<br>
I may have mentioned &quot;quantum teleportation&quot; as one particular possibility,
<br>
but if this possibility is proved impossible, that doesn't affect my point
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p>On this particular topic, I seem to be in pretty close agreement with
<br>
Eliezer.
<br>
<p>I think there is a reasonably good analogy with a dog who has cornered his
<br>
human victim and thinks there's no way the human can escape -- until the
<br>
human is rescued by a helicopter, something the dog has never seen or
<br>
imagined, and which lies outside the world-model of the dog.
<br>
<p>We may prove a box is impregnable based on our &quot;physical laws&quot;, but these
<br>
so-called laws are not absolute truth, they're just hypotheses that we've
<br>
made in order to fit the data we've collected and observed....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that we should accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Our theory is not the final ultimate theory of everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. It is possible that there exists a box-exploit in physics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I disagree with is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. It is likely that there exists a box-exploit, and furthermore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a box-exploit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is reasonable under circumstance C.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact that there could be a mind before which we are dog-like in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual capacity doesn't mean that (3) is true. It just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that if (3)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is true, then it's more likely that the mind will find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit. Also, the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we have been wrong a lot in physics in the past does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support (3), only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1) and (2).
</em><br>
<p>I agree that assessing the probability that there exists a box-exploit is
<br>
something that we don't currently know how to do in a rigorous way.
<br>
<p>So, the assessment of this probability, at present, comes down to
<br>
qualitative and intuitive considerations.
<br>
<p>This doesn't mean that plausible, rational arguments can't be made (even if
<br>
they fall short of full scientific rigor), of course.
<br>
<p>But the only arguments I know how to make to bolster my intuition that
<br>
box-exploits are reasonably likely, are complex arguments that depend on
<br>
detailed arguments about specific places where I think modern physics may be
<br>
incomplete.  This is a topic better reviewed in a long technical paper than
<br>
a casual email...
<br>
<p>So for now, I agree that no rigorous arguments have been made in favor of 3,
<br>
only some fairly vague intuitive ones.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
