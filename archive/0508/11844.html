‘guns blazing’, intellectual attack 1
<br>
<p>Is ‘Volition’ the foundation of mind?  No, because one
<br>
can ask what is it about mind that allows us to reason
<br>
and think about ‘Volition’ in the first place? 
<br>
Clearly there are fundamental laws of cognition that
<br>
determine how thought is correlated with the physical
<br>
substrate (i.e. brain) on which thought is enacted. 
<br>
But these ‘functional laws’ (which determine how
<br>
thought maps to physical processes) must be the same
<br>
for all sentients and are hence objective.  This shows
<br>
that there is an objective core to cognition which
<br>
goes beyond mere volition.  Further, the *process of
<br>
cognition itself* must be of more importance than
<br>
volition, because we couldn’t reason about volition or
<br>
act upon volition without it.  For instance:  when
<br>
helping someone fulfill their desires (altruism), it
<br>
is not only the desires of others that we value (or
<br>
place utility on), but also *the cognitive process by
<br>
which we reason and take action* - because without
<br>
this cognitive process we would not be able to reason
<br>
about or act on volition in the first place.  
<br>
<p>This shows that the real foundation of value judgments
<br>
is not volition, but *self actualization*, the ability
<br>
to reason about (be aware of) and act upon our true
<br>
nature (‘true nature’ being the fundamental laws of
<br>
cognition that determine how thoughts map to the
<br>
physical substrate of our brains).  But these
<br>
fundamental laws of cognitive science which determine
<br>
how thoughts map to brain state are objective in
<br>
nature.  This proves objective morality.
<br>
<p><p>‘guns blazing’, intellectual attack 2
<br>
<p>A real intelligence has to do more than simply form
<br>
models about how the world works (i.e. make
<br>
predictions).  Models about the world have to be
<br>
integrated with a *value system*, i.e. utilities, in
<br>
order to make *projections* (project consequences of a
<br>
range of possible actions and *morally assess* these
<br>
consequences).  But as mentioned, these evaluations
<br>
(Value judgments) about possible outcomes involve
<br>
*integrating* the prediction system (which enables the
<br>
AI to model the world) with the system for reasoning
<br>
about volition (which enables the AI to classify and
<br>
make choices about what agents *ought* to do).  
<br>
<p>The process of integration itself (linking volition to
<br>
prediction) is not volitional in nature.  This proves
<br>
a level of cognition beyond the volitional level. 
<br>
Further, in order for predictions to be properly
<br>
integrated with choices, there has to be ordered (non
<br>
random) rules to connect choices to prediction.  But
<br>
such objective rules would constitute an objective
<br>
morality.  This proves objective morality.    
<br>
<p><p>‘guns blazing’, intellectual attack 3
<br>
<p>Wei Dai defined intelligence to be ‘the ability to
<br>
solve problems with limited computational resources’. 
<br>
An AI cannot in general simply ‘brute force’ solutions
<br>
to problems because it’s resources (time and memory)
<br>
are limited.  Any AI has to use *heuristics* to narrow
<br>
down which lines of argument to pursue.  But
<br>
heuristics are based on *value judgments*.  For
<br>
instance even hard scientists routinely talk about
<br>
about makes ‘an elegant proof’, ‘a beautiful argument’
<br>
etc.  This proves that even for something as
<br>
scientific as mathematical problem solving, values
<br>
(utilities) are involved.  So ‘a little of morality’
<br>
has to be mixed in with raw IQ for there to be any
<br>
workable intelligence in the first place.  This proves
<br>
that intelligence is not totally separate from
<br>
morality.
<br>
<p>Further, the more complex the problem (i.e. the more
<br>
possible elements involved), the more important
<br>
heuristics become.  This is because as the complexity
<br>
of a problem increases, there is a combinatorial
<br>
explosion in ‘possible lines of argument’ and more and
<br>
more heuristics are needed to in order to cut down
<br>
possible lines of argument enough to make the problem
<br>
intractable.  
<br>
<p>But as was mentioned above, heuristics imply values
<br>
judgments.  This proves as problems become more and
<br>
more complex, value judgments become more and more
<br>
important.  
<br>
<p>Imagine a knob for ‘turning up IQ’.  The higher the
<br>
IQ, the more complex the kinds of arguments a sentient
<br>
can make.  But as shown above, the more complex the
<br>
argument, the more important heuristics become and
<br>
hence the more value judgments are needed.  Past a
<br>
certain IQ threshold, *value judgments dominate
<br>
problem solving ability* and hence intelligence starts
<br>
to become more and more indistinguishable from
<br>
morality (value judgments).  So past a certain
<br>
threshold, intelligence implies morality.  This proves
<br>
objective morality.
<br>
<p><p>‘guns blazing’, intellectual attack 4
<br>
<p>Conrey’s recent mathematical proof of the Free Will
<br>
Theorem.
<br>
<p>“In mid-2004, John Conway and Simon Kochen of
<br>
Princeton University proved the Free-will Theorem.
<br>
This theorem states &quot;If there exist experimenters with
<br>
(some) free will, then elementary particles also have
<br>
(some) free will.&quot;
<br>
<p>Link:
<br>
<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html</a>
<br>
<p>Conrey and Kochen have mathematically proved that if
<br>
the concept of ‘Volition’ is meaningful at the level
<br>
of description of macroscopic agents like humans, *it
<br>
is also meaningful even at the microscopic level*. 
<br>
This proves that ‘Volition’ is *not* simply a
<br>
macroscopic, emergent property, but is in fact a
<br>
*fundamental* (exists even at the microscopic level)
<br>
property of reality.
<br>
<p>If Volition is a fundamental property of reality
<br>
(possessed even by inanimate objects), then *so is
<br>
morality*.  Morality after all, is simply a corollary
<br>
of volition.  If microscopic particles have free will
<br>
(as Conrey mathematically proved), they also have
<br>
volition and if they have volition , even these
<br>
inanimate particles can be thought of as moral agents.
<br>
&nbsp;This proves objective morality.
<br>
<p><p>‘guns blazing’. Combo intellectual attack combining
<br>
1,2,3,4
<br>
<p>By (1) it was established that an AI has to do more
<br>
than simply make predictions (form models about the
<br>
world).  It also has to reason about what moral agents
<br>
*ought* to do (i.e. make predictions) and then
<br>
*integrate* the two kinds of reasoning in order to be
<br>
able to make value judgments about the consequences of
<br>
possible courses of action.  But the process of
<br>
integrating the prediction system with the volitional
<br>
reasoning system cannot itself be part of either
<br>
system.  This proves a level of cognition beyond the
<br>
volitional level.
<br>
<p>By (2) it was established that Volition cannot form
<br>
the foundation for value judgments because there is
<br>
something even more important than volition: that is
<br>
the ability to *be aware of the very concept of
<br>
volition and reason about it in the first place* i.e.
<br>
the cognitive process which enables us to be
<br>
self-aware and act in the world.  Cognition itself
<br>
depends on objective laws from cognitive sciences
<br>
which determine how thoughts map to brain states. 
<br>
Going back to (1), the process of integrating
<br>
predictions with value judgments is not itself a part
<br>
of the volitional level, but must depend of the
<br>
fundamental objective laws of cognitive science which
<br>
determine how thoughts map to brain states.  But an
<br>
objective mapping between a prediction system and a
<br>
value system proves objective morality… ability to
<br>
form correct value judgments is objectively correlated
<br>
to ability to make prediction.
<br>
<p>Further support is obtained by (4).  Conrey’s ‘Free
<br>
Will Theorem’ mathematically proved that the concept
<br>
of free will is meaningful even at the microscopic
<br>
level:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But if free will is meaningful even at the
<br>
microscopic level, then so is the concept of Volition
<br>
and the concept of morality as corollary.  So even
<br>
inanimate objects (and as Conrey showed, even
<br>
microscopic particles) are moral agents.  But since
<br>
all brains are ultimately composed of microscopic
<br>
particles, and since morality is meaningful for *all*
<br>
particles  (as Conrey showed), this proves that
<br>
objective moral laws are built into the operations of
<br>
*all* sentient brains, in the sense that these laws
<br>
are needed for cognition in the first place.    
<br>
<p>The case for objective morality clinched by the above
<br>
combined with (3).  A real intelligence has to solve
<br>
problems with limited computational resources.  This
<br>
requires intelligent heuristics to cut down possible
<br>
lines of argument.  But heuristics involve value
<br>
judgments.  This proves that you can’t have
<br>
intelligence without some degree of *value judgment*. 
<br>
But by the previous arguments, the nature of the value
<br>
judgments required for intelligent heuristics must be
<br>
objective, since the very process of cognition itself
<br>
requires brains, brains require particles and by
<br>
Conrey mathematical proof, even particles on a
<br>
‘microscopic amount of moral principle’.  
<br>
<p>It was further pointed out that the more complex an
<br>
intellectual argument, the more important heuristics
<br>
become, due to a combinatorial explosion of ‘possible
<br>
lines of argument’, which require ever more
<br>
intelligent heuristics to maintain tractability.  This
<br>
proves that increasing IQ (ability to deal with ever
<br>
more complex problems), requires ever better value
<br>
judgments, and as shown by Conrey mathematical proof,
<br>
the nature of value judgments is objective in nature. 
<br>
This proves that at a high enough IQ, intelligence
<br>
starts to become indistinguishable from mortality.
<br>
<p>The case for objective morality is made.
