<em>&gt; IQ is more of an enabler that bounds the possibility space; no amount of

</em><br>
<p>So-called &quot;g-factor&quot; - the large correlation that all intelligence tests 
<br>
exhibit with each other and with real-life measures such as financial success 
<br>
- measures *relative* intelligence between humans.  g-factor discriminates 
<br>
Einstein versus a village idiot, not between the small cluster consisting of 
<br>
&quot;all humans everywhere&quot; versus the clusters for chimps, rats, and reptiles. 
<br>
Chimps can't even take an IQ test - which only goes to illustrate the point. 
<br>
We've got to distinguish between g-factor load, the correlation between tests 
<br>
of intelligence within the human species, and human general intelligence, 
<br>
which makes us capable of challenging problems that other species can't even 
<br>
comprehend.
<br>
<p>IQ tests don't measure what people can do in principle, what they are 
<br>
fundamentally too stupid or too smart to do.  IQ tests measure who does it the 
<br>
fastest, most reliably, and with the least effort.  I suspect that much of the 
<br>
observed effect of g-factor arises from people specializing in what they can 
<br>
excel at socially.  What's the point of becoming a financial trader if you 
<br>
can't out-trade the next guy?  What's the point of becoming a molecular 
<br>
biologist if you'll never be the first to invent a new theory?  But that 
<br>
doesn't mean that you'd never *ever* have gotten the answer, if you could have 
<br>
studied all the evidence quietly without competition.  If you expect to 
<br>
straggle in last in the race, you never study the field - in which case you'll 
<br>
*really* never get it.
<br>
<p>So I have to question the term:  &quot;Fundamentally&quot; too stupid?  Really, 
<br>
fundamentally too stupid?  A chimp is fundamentally too stupid but is it 
<br>
likely that a non-brain-damaged adult human would be *fundamentally* too stupid?
<br>
<p>Complex adaptations are necessarily universal within a species.  Suppose an 
<br>
adaptation with ten necessary parts: if each of the genes are independently at 
<br>
50% frequency in the gene pool - each gene possessed by only half the 
<br>
organisms - then on average only 1 in 1024 organisms will possess the full, 
<br>
functioning adaptation.  Thus the ten parts must be driven to 
<br>
near-universality before substantial selection pressure exists for an eleventh 
<br>
part that depends on the other ten.  Complex, interdependent machinery is 
<br>
*necessarily* universal within a biological species; it cannot evolve 
<br>
otherwise.  One robin may have smoother feathers than another, but they will 
<br>
both have wings.  Natural selection, while feeding on variation, uses it up. 
<br>
Individual differences between humans are a tiny froth on the surface of a 
<br>
deep, still water.
<br>
<p>I do understand where James Rogers is coming from on this one.  In my youth to 
<br>
earn pocket money, I tutored in algebra an adult student who couldn't keep 
<br>
track of what exponentiation meant.  I tried my best to go back to basics, but 
<br>
I don't think I succeeded in helping her.  I admit I got the impression - and 
<br>
it was a horrifying thought - that some people, through no fault of their own, 
<br>
could *never* understand linear algebra or calculus, never ever no matter how 
<br>
much hard work they put in.  Like her math module was just missing.  Being 
<br>
young and poorly trained in rationality, I might have refused to even 
<br>
formulate such a thought, to contemplate an Earth so horribly unfair and 
<br>
askew, if I hadn't already been planning to fix it all post-Singularity.
<br>
<p>Maybe it takes childhood training to force the relevant area of cerebral 
<br>
cortex to become a number sense.  Maybe if you don't develop a number sense in 
<br>
childhood you never develop a number sense.  Maybe if you can't perform 
<br>
certain mental operations very *reliably*, the conjunctive probability of 
<br>
completing an entire chain of mathematical reasoning is too low, and you can't 
<br>
learn from experience.  But I would guess that even total mathematical 
<br>
incompetents are not actually missing any brain modules and could understand 
<br>
calculus given sufficient training, time, and effort.  Evolutionary biology 
<br>
*requires* that all the basic machinery that I have is present in them also. 
<br>
The only differences can be speed, quantity, tilted balances, maybe some minor 
<br>
surface variations in complex mechanisms, and most of all training.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Giving a person a high IQ is kind of like giving a person a million dollars.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A few individuals will do something interesting with it, but most will piss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it away on trinkets and pointless exercises.  Call it human nature I guess,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but few people exploit the potential of the resources at their disposal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Doing something constructive is rarely, if ever, the path of least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistance.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In practice, a very high IQ will not do anyone much good without discipline,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; focus, and ambition.  If IQ is not effectively applied to real tasks or if
</em><br>
<em> &gt; one has no real goals to apply IQ to, it will not do a person much good to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; have a high IQ.  While discipline, focus, and ambition can be developed to a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; certain extent, many of those properties are undoubtedly controlled to a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; significant extent by genetics and biochemistry.  Hell, diet affects these
</em><br>
<em> &gt; characteristics to a significant extent.
</em><br>
<p>Few people study rationality formally.  Few people learn probability theory 
<br>
and decision theory, heuristics and biases, social psychology, evolutionary 
<br>
psychology.  Even among those who conceive of rationality as a learnable 
<br>
skill, it is not commonly realized that the art of rationality has progressed 
<br>
to the point of including component maths and sciences, or that rationality is 
<br>
an exact art - a dance instead of a walk where each step needs to land in 
<br>
exactly the right spot, neither to the right nor to the left.  More people 
<br>
train their body to unforgiving precision to their mind, because it's easier 
<br>
and more comfortable to overlook a fuzzy answer than to not notice when you 
<br>
hit a wooden board wrong.  There are many more fifth-dan martial artists than 
<br>
fifth-dan Bayesians; hell, there aren't even formal schools for advanced 
<br>
rationality training.
<br>
<p>But despite appearances, rationality is no more bound to high IQ than martial 
<br>
arts is bound to athleticism.  People who aren't athletic or who don't enjoy 
<br>
physical exertion aren't likely to learn martial arts because they won't excel 
<br>
socially in that forum.  But evolutionary biology requires that they have the 
<br>
same muscular and skeletal anatomy as a ninth-dan judo master, and logically, 
<br>
the same training ought to work.
<br>
<p>I don't conceive of my rationality studies as training my high IQ.  I conceive 
<br>
of my rationality studies as training my human general intelligence.  How 
<br>
could you train g-factor, anyway?  It'd be like training a measure of 
<br>
correlation between performances on muscular tasks.  Martial arts doesn't 
<br>
train correlations or standard deviations from the mean, it trains muscles.
