<p>
That's incorrect : Objective != Universal.
<br>
<p>Universal means that the same morality applies universally (i.e. for
<br>
everyone) whereas Objective means that for any one person their
<br>
morality is an objective fact.
<br>
<p>i.e. with Universal morality, an action is moral no matter who takes
<br>
it, whereas with objective morality, you can have actions that are
<br>
right-for-me but wrong-for-you, because of (for example) things we
<br>
might know, or difference in our cognitive schemas, etc.
<br>
<p>Subtle difference though, and not always (or often) reflected in useage.
<br>
<p>Just as we have a science for physics, it's not inconcievable that we
<br>
could have a science for morality. Or, if not morality, a science
<br>
surrounding a set of variables measuring things which one might
<br>
describe as &quot;moral&quot;. No need to get into a definitional debate right
<br>
away.
<br>
<p>Most people on this list accept that moral-for-humans !=
<br>
moral-for-all-consciousnesses. Geddes bangs on about how behaving in a
<br>
moral way might be an evolutionary advantage, and maybe he's right and
<br>
maybe he's not. But that's what he's trying to say.
<br>
<p>It's certainly not out of the question that one could, for any given
<br>
definition of morality, perform science on it, and establish the truth
<br>
or otherwise of a variety of claims.
<br>
<p>Cheers,

<em>&gt; Hello,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have been reading the SL4 list for some time now.  I have repeatedly seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people (mostly Mark Geddes but sometimes others) use the phrase &quot;Objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Morality&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a list which is supposed to be humanities best hope, I find this highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconcerting.  The phrase &quot;Objective Morality&quot; (sometimes pronounced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Universal Morality&quot;) makes as much sense as &quot;colorless green idea&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any statements about it is vacuous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider it means for a statement to be objective.  It means that a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system using Bayes' Law and reasonable priors (and there are ways of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these!) will arrive at that conclusion that the statement is highly probable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the available evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I encourage you to read Technical Explanation of Technical Explanation:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the full explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, if you don't believe that the accuracy of Newton's Law of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universal Gravitation is objective, observe the moon's orbit.  It very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurately matches the theory.  Because this evidence is rather improbable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given ignorance, but highly probable assuming Universal Gravitation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the law should have a reasonably high prior, one can safely conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Newton's law is in fact accurate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, what about objective morality?  The only way to find out would be by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing the morality of some test scenarios.  However, this can not be done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because performing the test would entail already having some definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturally, any definition of morality would pass with flying colors if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were tested against itself this way!  Thus the likelihood of the evidence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same whether our hypothetical &quot;objective&quot; morality is objective or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only possible piece of evidence has no strength whatsoever.  &quot;Objective&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a complete misnomer for anything with this property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that I am *not* saying that there is no optimal definition of morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for human kind, determinable by Coherent Extrapolated Volition.  I'm simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that this optimal morality does not have a special place in the grand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scheme of things and that if we don't try to instantiate it, we won't.
</em><br>
