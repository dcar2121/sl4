</em><br>
<p>See below.  What cognitive principles underpin
<br>
Induction?  Induction is what enables us to reason  in
<br>
the first place, therefore the general cognitive
<br>
processes that enable Induction to occur must be
<br>
objectively *good*.  The cognitive procedures behind
<br>
Induction are open to experimental testing.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Physics isn't Psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Are you sure?  Objective Idealism treats physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; form of cognition you know.  How can something be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to exist at all if it wasn't being *interpreted*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some sort of cognitive proccess?  Everything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the world requires a mental model to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comprehended you realize?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So physics is a form of cognition?  Things exist by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being interpreted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alright then!  Let's put that to the test!  Nope. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry.  The test object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed to disappear when I stopped thinking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  I was also completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsuccessful at telekinesis.
</em><br>
<p>Objective Idealism does not say that things are
<br>
mind-created.  There exists an objective reality
<br>
outside our heads.  Objective Idealism says that
<br>
*reality itself* is cognition.  Take for instance
<br>
theories of panpsychism, that assign some degree of
<br>
consciousness to everything.
<br>
<p>The theory of computation says that a computation is
<br>
only a computation if there is: (a) Some raw data and
<br>
(b)  A Metalanguage assigning *meaning* to the data. 
<br>
Since all reality is computation (theory of universal
<br>
computation), reality must have a dual-aspect: being
<br>
able to operate both as data (an object) and it's own
<br>
meta-language (a *subject*).

<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --- GENERAL VS. SPECIFIC ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you make a statement about sentient minds in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general, it must also apply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, because they are an instance of sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds in general.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect sentient minds in general to have underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles, human minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must also share those same principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Abstract out all the arbitrary hodge podge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the human brain and look *only* at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *neccessery*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; features - the general properties of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; required for rationality and self-awareness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --- HODGE PODGE ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now there's a tricky one!  How we know which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles are necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for sentience?  Sentience is not a very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood phenomenon.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, if I use Mark Geddes' definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience (if one was proposed)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then he will naturally be completely right about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything he says about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And even if I conceded that definition of the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience, we would still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to worry about all the &quot;non-sentients&quot; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might do nasty things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baby munching or tiling the universe with paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clips.
</em><br>
<p>We know what is neccessery for reasoning:  Induction
<br>
and Deduction.  We know what is neccessery for
<br>
self-awareness:  the integration of current experience
<br>
with past memories (John Taylor's Realational Theory).
<br>
&nbsp;These things constitute sentience.  Without the
<br>
ability to reason a mind cannot achieve its goals. 
<br>
Without the ability to be self-aware a mind cannot
<br>
experience anything and hence such a mind would not be
<br>
a *moral* subject. 
<br>
<p>Induction, Deduction and the Relational Theory are
<br>
well-defined.  Ethically then, the general cognitive
<br>
proccesses underpinning them constitite things that
<br>
must be *objectively* (universally) good.  Why? 
<br>
because without them, a mind cannot think about ethics
<br>
in the first place, nor can it be a moral subject.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brains run on physical laws, there should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles that apply to all sentients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --- COMMON PRINCIPLES ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly I should point out that &quot;principle&quot; has at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least two meanings, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical meaning, as in &quot;the principle of least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distance&quot; and a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning, as in &quot;a person of principle&quot;.  They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very different.  You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentionally or unintentionally mixing them up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, sure, the laws of electromagnetism apply to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients, as do all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other established physical principles.  But this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not mean that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting intelligences follow common moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles.  No morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherent in the universe for reasons I already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained.
</em><br>
<p>For the reasons I carefully explained above, morality
<br>
*is* inherent in the universe.  As I explained, brains
<br>
runs on physical principles.  As I explained, brains
<br>
cannot reason without these general well-defined
<br>
principles: Induction, Deduction.  As I explained,
<br>
brains cannot experience anything without the general
<br>
property of consciousness (caused by the interaction
<br>
of current experience with past memories).  Since
<br>
brains cannot reason about ethics and cannot be
<br>
ethical subjects unless Induction, Deduction and
<br>
Qualia are occurring, the general *objective*
<br>
cognitive procedures underpinning Induction, Deduction
<br>
and Consciousness must be *universal* goods, in the
<br>
sense that *all* ethical sentients must agree that
<br>
they are good (no sentient could claim that they are
<br>
not good without contradiction, since they are
<br>
cognitive processes that enable one to think and be
<br>
self-aware in the first place).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Consciousness, Values and Intelligence *are*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fundamental properties of the cosmos that need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --- PROGRAM ANALOGY ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  Is &lt;insert your favorite large computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program here&gt; a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of the microchip it is running on?  Try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagining your program with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some new feature added, or some old feature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discarded and you will see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that program was not fundamental.  In the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesize many different versions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, values and intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the same way, all three of the properties you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention are no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental to the universe than the program is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the microchip.  Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of these three things are complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional adaptations to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary environment.  AIs and aliens will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different versions by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason of different design/evolution.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not using the word 'consciousness' to mean a
<br>
*particular kind* of consciousness.  Go look at the
<br>
dictionary definition of 'Conscious'.  It's a noun -
<br>
I'm talking about *consciousness itself*.  
<br>
<p>Take your example above.  I'm not talking about *a*
<br>
particular computer program, I'm talking about
<br>
*programs in general*.  *A* particular computer
<br>
program is not fundmental, but *computation itself*
<br>
is.  In fact Alan Turing's mathematical theory of
<br>
UNIVERSAL computation provides strong evidence that
<br>
computation is a fundamental property of the universe,
<br>
in the sense that computation is everywhere present.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the general properties *intelligence*,
<br>
*values* and *consciousness* could easily be
<br>
fundamental properties of the universe as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Humans are not the only beings that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conscious, have intelligence and have values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  However the values may be completely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from ours, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is optional.  Computer programs can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say practically anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An intelligence can believe practically anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what is desirable, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not even have that concept in any recognizable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form.  That is the point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And as I pointed out above, if you abstract out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the hodge-podge features, you'd be left with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; general features common to all sentients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See HODGE PODGE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just throw brains together willy-nilly.  There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; common physical principles required for brains to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See COMMON PRINCIPLES.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are not defining Universal as all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; humanity, which would make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Collective, what or who do you even mean by it? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you are postulating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; deity, it might really be time for somebody to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the list sniper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I never mentioned a deity.    Read what I say.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clearly defined 'Universal' as something held in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; common *by all logically possible sentients*. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clearly different from a Collective.  See the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difference:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Collective:  Something defined by reference to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *currently* existing sentients in some context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Universal:  Something deifned by reference to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *logically possible* sentients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The space of all logically possible sentients is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely massive!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides sentience itself, I very much doubt you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find much in common.
</em><br>
<p>Remember that minds require brains and brains are
<br>
physical objects.  If there was nothing in the space
<br>
of all logically possible minds, it would mean that
<br>
one part of physical reality would not be able to
<br>
interact with all other parts of physical reality in a
<br>
consistent way.  The laws of physics themselves
<br>
couldn't function.  Since the laws of physics *do*
<br>
apepar to be consistent and function the same
<br>
UNIVERSALLY (as far as we can tell), there must be at
<br>
least one thing that all possible minds have in
<br>
common.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You say my true nature is to be self-aware, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason and to be altruistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might even admit that that is definition of sane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity's true nature, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least what we want it to be, albeit an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-simplified one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, to say that these are the true nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience is another thing all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together.  You are listing treating three distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties as a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All three of these properties are probably as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-fundamental as the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of rice pudding and income tax.  (See PROGRAM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ANALOGY)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>See above.  I pointed out a mind which cannot reason
<br>
cannot reason about ethics.  Therefore the ability to
<br>
reason is a prequiste to ethics.  I pointed out that
<br>
reasoning depends on Induction and Deduction, for
<br>
which there are well-defined theories with UNIVERSAL
<br>
applicability.  Since reasoning is needed for ethics,
<br>
and since the cognitive processes needed for ethics
<br>
are objective, it follows that the cognitive processes
<br>
needed for reasoning must be *universally good*.
<br>
<p>Similarly, with consciousness.  A mind which is not
<br>
conscious is not a moral subject.  Therefore the
<br>
ability to be conscious is a prequiste to being a
<br>
moral subject.  But there's an *objective* theory of
<br>
consciousness - by John Taylor - consciousness is
<br>
caused by the interaction of current experience with
<br>
past memories.  Since consciousness is neeeded to be
<br>
an ethical subject and since the cognitive processes
<br>
needed for consciousness are objective, it follows
<br>
that cognitive processes needed for consciousness must
<br>
be *universally good*
<br>
<p>ALL sentients everywhere, in order to be consistent,
<br>
must conclude that the cognitive proccesses resulting
<br>
in reasoning and consciousness are good.  If any
<br>
sentient tried to say that these cognitive proccesses
<br>
were bad, they would be contradicting themslves, since
<br>
without these cognitive proccesses the sentient would
<br>
be unable to reason about ethics in the first place.  
<br>
<p>This proves Objective morality.
