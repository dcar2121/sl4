</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overcome these low priors.  Likewise with the AI-box.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the competing hypothesis for AI-box, and what

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; things they don't expect to be convinced of' hypothesis?
</em><br>
<p>The competing hypothesis is that there is some trivial
<br>
reason that Eliezer is winning these experiments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1b.  Someone once said that a scientist is someone who,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instead of believing something because he sees it, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someone who believes something because he has a theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it. I can't construct a theory for the AI-box results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without more details of what happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't construct a specific theory of what happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the aim is not to make a specific prediction. The aim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is simply to predict if a prepared, intelligent person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be convinced.
</em><br>
<p>And I won't &quot;believe&quot; that the outcome of the experiment
<br>
means that a prepared, intelligent person can be convinced,
<br>
unless I can construct a theory as to how that would
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3. The outcome is meant to suggest that, if Eliezer can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; convince an arbitrary human to do something they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dead-set against doing, then so can an AI.  But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had such powers, why can't he consistently convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on SL4 to change their views?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, this isn't the aim of the experiment, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more general prediction would be harder to make or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify. The question is whether the very specific action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of letting an AGI of unknown ethics out of a box is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that people can be convinced to do.
</em><br>
<p>The fact that Eliezer can't persuade
<br>
an arbitrary person even of things Eliezer believes
<br>
is evidence against the hypothesis that he is able to
<br>
persuade them to let the AI out of the box, and in favor
<br>
of the hypothesis that there's a trivial trick to it.
