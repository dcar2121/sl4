</em><br>
<p>Yes, but that's where this conversation *began*.  We're already
<br>
assuming that.  The A B C -&gt; X Y Z example shows how, one step at
<br>
a time, the system can take actions that provide greater utility
<br>
from the perspective of its top-level goals, that nonetheless end
<br>
up replacing all those top-level goals.
<br>
<p>Another question entirely is whether, if the AI is told to maximize
<br>
a score relating to the attainment of its top-level goals, and is
<br>
given write access to those goals, it will rewrite those goals into
<br>
ones more easily attainable?  (We could call this the &quot;Buddhist AI&quot;,
<br>
perhaps?)  The REAL top-level goal in that case
<br>
is &quot;maximize a score defined by the contents of memory locations X&quot;,
<br>
but it doesn't help us to say that &quot;maximization&quot; won't be replaced.
<br>
The kinds of goals we don't want to be replaced have referents
<br>
in the real world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, it seems to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me that you are saying that you can see a way in which its behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could accidentally lead to low utility outcomes, yet if that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the case, why  don't you expect it to see that same potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome and avoid it, at least once it is human equivalent.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to be proposing that an AI will never make mistakes.
<br>
Making mistakes is a second way in which top-level goals can
<br>
drift away from where they started.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At any given time, a FAI will be acting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to maximize its utility function.  It is possible that in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases, changing supergoals would maximize its current utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function,
</em><br>
<p>The supergoal IS the utility function.  In the A, B, C example,
<br>
the utility function is a combination of A, B, and C.
