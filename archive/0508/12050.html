<em>&gt; Something like that - I would say that, if you want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicate what brains do, it would be good to think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions that map high-dimensional inputs into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-dimensional outputs, rather than about arithmetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or logic operators.  Signal processing has accumulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large toolkit of useful functions of that kind.
</em><br>
<p>True. You still have to work out a scheme for identifying
<br>
which to use, how to implement them and how to integrate
<br>
them to solve any particular problem, but I agree that
<br>
a database of algorithms (including say the entire contents
<br>
of 'The Art of Computer Programming') will be useful if
<br>
you can solve these problems.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If you're thinking of programming an AI by creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rational inference substrate - e.g., a 1970s-style
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic engine - I'm surprised.
</em><br>
<p>Considering how early and often I have derided '1970s
<br>
style logic engines' or rather classic symbolic AI, it
<br>
is apparent that whatever I'm doing it's not going to
<br>
be closely related. I agree that such methods have been
<br>
exhaustively tested and found to be useless for AGI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're still speaking as if I were the one advocating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergence, but you're the one advocating creating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;basic substrate&quot; and letting learning do the rest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is a more emergence-friendly viewpoint.
</em><br>
<p>Actual I'm relatively keen on having a decent sized
<br>
programmer-supplied knowledge base, as long as everything
<br>
in that knowledge base could theoretically have been
<br>
learnt and can be understood in retrospect (I apologise
<br>
for leaving 'understanding' undefined, but that's a very
<br>
long discussion that has been thrashed out before). The
<br>
'emergence' issue isn't about that though. It's about two
<br>
things (a) the causal relationships between the mechanisms
<br>
specified by the programmers and the mechanisms created by
<br>
the AI, and (b) whether you understand how the AI implements
<br>
basic cognitive operations, before and after it starts
<br>
solving nontrivial problems. Core mechanisms such as
<br>
action selection based on the expected utility of outcomes
<br>
and Bayesian adjustment of beliefs strongly determine the
<br>
structure of all AI cognition such that certain constraints
<br>
will reliably hold, and can be made stable under
<br>
self-modification; the causal flow is one-way from the
<br>
core mechanisms to the structure of the rest of the AI to
<br>
actions to reality. Designers that propose 'emergence' don't
<br>
have a good idea how cognition can actually be implemented,
<br>
so they propose to search solution space until they find
<br>
something that seems to act intelligently. This solution
<br>
will not be well understood and will almost certainly not
<br>
have a clean causal structure. It may actually be possible
<br>
to specify a fitness function (or validator for iterative
<br>
AGI-building algorithms that don't have an explicit fitness
<br>
function) that would only generate causally clean systems,
<br>
but I have yet to see anyone other than me (temporarily,
<br>
a while ago) propose this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Ok, so we have at least two people sharing this view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibly more if the AAII people are taking this view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pattern processing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is AAII?
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://www.adaptiveai.com/">http://www.adaptiveai.com/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm guessing that you are thinking that pure logic is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to go,
</em><br>
<p>Probably not with the same definition of logic as you. Last
<br>
time I checked Bayesian networks were hip and hot in
<br>
mainstream AGI, yet no-one is calling them '1970s reasoning
<br>
systems', despite the fact that they're just as 'logical'.
<br>
I think that Bayesian networks are a good start, probably
<br>
the most promising widely used technique, but a beginning
<br>
only.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How is your viewpoint different from the old AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint that we spent the 1980s and 1990s demolishing?
</em><br>
<p>As most researchers with a serious architecture seem to be
<br>
saying by now, 'that would take a book'. Well, maybe not a
<br>
book, but I'm not sufficiently keen to convince you that I
<br>
personally am on the right track to spend a great deal more
<br>
time discussing it on yet another forum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think we can do better.  The &quot;inaccurate&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly flexible, fuzzy categorization is an advantage,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a design flaw.
</em><br>
<p>'Fuzzy categorisation' does not need to imply brainlike
<br>
forgetting, category blending, variable accessibility and
<br>
general random lossage. It implies probability distributions
<br>
over sets of entities, such that you can prioritise
<br>
categories and possible interpretations and allocate
<br>
inferential resources accordingly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't mean fuzzy logic.  Fuzzy logic is still logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Real intelligent systems don't use logic
</em><br>
<p>Either you mean 'real intelligent systems that exist right
<br>
now, i.e. humans' or you're  falsely generalising from
<br>
'humans'. And in any case since computers operate on
<br>
(boolean) logic, you're saying that we need a logical
<br>
emulation of illogic to make an AGI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in which case the use of logic is probably implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the same mechanisms as other learned tasks, such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as playing the piano.
</em><br>
<p>True. When we use logic to learn things we call it science.
<br>
A technique which has had some modest successes.
