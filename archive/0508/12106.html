</em><br>
<p>There are two possible metrics by which you can judge efficiency, and
<br>
it seems you folks are confusing the two.  You can judge the
<br>
efficiency of a system either 1) by measuring how much output you get
<br>
from a given input, or 2) measuring the rate at which the system is
<br>
operating versus its maximum possible/theoretical rate.
<br>
<p>Take a car as an example.  There's a certain miles-per-gallon
<br>
efficiency that your car has.  If you use the most expensive gasoline,
<br>
change the oil regularly, and drive properly (without accelerating or
<br>
breaking too fast, or driving too fast), you'll probably get close to
<br>
100% efficiency out of that car (close to the advertised miles/ga). 
<br>
If you neglect the car, don't change the oil or give it necessary
<br>
repairs, and drive erratically, you'll get far less efficiency. 
<br>
That's one metric.  However, the amount of output (let's say as
<br>
mechanical energy) given the input (as chemical energy) is far worse. 
<br>
That's a different metric.
<br>
<p>When you say that photosynthesis operates at 12% efficiency, you're
<br>
simply comparing the output versus the input, say in Joules.  But
<br>
given the nature of the system -- conjugated molecules absorbing
<br>
radiant energy, proteins catalyzing energy tranfers, etc. -- evolution
<br>
has probably maximized the efficiency that's possible by this method
<br>
(and by this standard, photosynthesis operates at close to 100%
<br>
efficiency).
<br>
<p>So when you say that the brain operates at &lt;1% efficiency, you should
<br>
mean according to what's theoretically possible (all information
<br>
currently available in the environment as input vs any theoretically
<br>
possible computational output), but I think you mean according to
<br>
*what's possible with neurons.*  Except that, what's possible with 1)
<br>
plama membrane-bound cells that 2) send actions potentials and 3) rely
<br>
on enzyme reaction rates, is a lot different than what's possible with
<br>
65 nm silicon wires or 10 nm carbon nanotubes.  Evolution has come
<br>
close to maximizing what's computationally possible with neural
<br>
wetware (given a particular synaptic organization).  Our brains are
<br>
functioning at close to 100% efficiency for what they are designed to
<br>
do.
