<br>
I take it by your silence that you concede that that particular experiment
<br>
wouldn't work.  This is because science can only answer true/false questions,
<br>
not right/wrong questions.  (I explained this in my first post)  Thus any
<br>
right/wrong question (ie. morality) isn't objective.  I'm not sure how
<br>
much clearer I can make this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; To summarize, the reason that you can't treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universal morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientifically is that there are no testable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiments that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; demonstrate whether any particular morality is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact the universal one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is absolutely nothing wrong with induction. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, induction can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be used here because there is no evidence on which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to use it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; See below.  What cognitive principles underpin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Induction?  Induction is what enables us to reason  in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first place, therefore the general cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes that enable Induction to occur must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectively *good*.  The cognitive procedures behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Induction are open to experimental testing.
</em><br>
--- CONSISTENCY ---
<br>
Firstly, when you talk about all logically possible sentients you are
<br>
including the inconsistent ones.  Needless to say, humans aren't consistent.
<br>
Neither are a large portion of logically possible sentients for that matter.
<br>
<p>--- MY INDUCTION ---
<br>
No.  It is true that if I am consistent,  then I will first conclude that my
<br>
actions are a good thing because they further my goal system, and then I will
<br>
conclude that my ability to use Induction and Deduction act in a smarter way
<br>
is also good thing.
<br>
<p>However, said consistent intelligence would only conclude that *its own*
<br>
cognitive abilities are good.  As for the cognitive abilities of other
<br>
intelligences, it would consider them good or bad depending on its opinion
<br>
of their goal systems.
<br>
<p>For example:  If during you had the ability to travel back in time and turn
<br>
Hitler into a moron who would be unable to use induction and deduction, would
<br>
you do it?
<br>
<p>If you answer no, your hypothetical actions would kill lots of innocent
<br>
people.  If you answer yes, you have proven that induction and deduction are
<br>
not fundamentally good on their own.  They are tools of no inherent
<br>
goodness or badness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics isn't Psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you sure?  Objective Idealism treats physics as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; form of cognition you know.  How can something be said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to exist at all if it wasn't being *interpreted* by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; some sort of cognitive proccess?  Everything you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about the world requires a mental model to be comprehended you realize?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So physics is a form of cognition?  Things exist by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being interpreted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Alright then!  Let's put that to the test!  Nope. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sorry.  The test object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; failed to disappear when I stopped thinking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it.  I was also completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unsuccessful at telekinesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objective Idealism does not say that things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-created.  There exists an objective reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside our heads.  Objective Idealism says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *reality itself* is cognition.  Take for instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories of panpsychism, that assign some degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness to everything.
</em><br>
Buy the new and improved Occam's Razor!  Only $0 at any retailer!
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The theory of computation says that a computation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only a computation if there is: (a) Some raw data and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b)  A Metalanguage assigning *meaning* to the data. 
</em><br>
You are confusing two different usages of the word meaning:
<br>
1) subjective meaning, as in &quot;that experience had meaning to me&quot;
<br>
and 2) technical meaning, as in &quot;the computer groks the meaning of the
<br>
bytes on the disk when it executes the program&quot;
<br>
<p>These two aren't the same.
<br>
You are using (1), and the theory of computation is using (2).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since all reality is computation (theory of universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation), reality must have a dual-aspect: being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to operate both as data (an object) and it's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-language (a *subject*).

<p><em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; --- HODGE PODGE ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now there's a tricky one!  How we know which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles are necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for sentience?  Sentience is not a very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understood phenomenon.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; course, if I use Mark Geddes' definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentience (if one was proposed)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then he will naturally be completely right about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything he says about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And even if I conceded that definition of the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentience, we would still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have to worry about all the &quot;non-sentients&quot; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might do nasty things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; baby munching or tiling the universe with paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clips.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We know what is neccessery for reasoning:  Induction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Deduction.  We know what is neccessery for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-awareness:  the integration of current experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with past memories (John Taylor's Realational Theory).
</em><br>
--- BADLY DEFINED CONSCIOUSNESS ---
<br>
&quot;the integration of current experience with past memories&quot;?
<br>
You aren't noticing the elephant in the room!  You are defining
<br>
self-awareness in terms of something called 'experience', which is a synonym.
<br>
You have made absolutely no progress until you define one of these &quot;fuzzy
<br>
words&quot; in terms of only non-fuzzy words.
<br>
<em>&gt;  These things constitute sentience.  Without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to reason a mind cannot achieve its goals. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without the ability to be self-aware a mind cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience anything and hence such a mind would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a *moral* subject. 
</em><br>
So it wouldn't be a moral subject.  Maybe not in our opinion, but it would
<br>
certainly peg its own existence as a rather large chunk of utility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Induction, Deduction and the Relational Theory are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-defined.
</em><br>
See BADLY DEFINED CONSCIOUSNESS.
<br>
<em>&gt; Ethically then, the general cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proccesses underpinning them constitite things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be *objectively* (universally) good.  Why? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because without them, a mind cannot think about ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the first place, nor can it be a moral subject.
</em><br>
See MY INDUCTION.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; brains run on physical laws, there should be general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; principles that apply to all sentients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; --- COMMON PRINCIPLES ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Firstly I should point out that &quot;principle&quot; has at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least two meanings, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical meaning, as in &quot;the principle of least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distance&quot; and a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaning, as in &quot;a person of principle&quot;.  They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very different.  You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intentionally or unintentionally mixing them up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, sure, the laws of electromagnetism apply to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentients, as do all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other established physical principles.  But this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does not mean that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resulting intelligences follow common moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; principles.  No morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inherent in the universe for reasons I already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the reasons I carefully explained above, morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *is* inherent in the universe.
</em><br>
See MORALITY NOT OBJECTIVE.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I explained, brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runs on physical principles.  As I explained, brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot reason without these general well-defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles: Induction, Deduction.  As I explained,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains cannot experience anything without the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of consciousness (caused by the interaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of current experience with past memories).
</em><br>
Brains cannot *experience* anything without consciousness, which is caused by
<br>
an interaction involving experience!?  If your reasoning were any more
<br>
circular you would be nibbling at your own toes!
<br>
<em>&gt; Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains cannot reason about ethics and cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical subjects unless Induction, Deduction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Qualia are occurring, the general *objective*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive procedures underpinning Induction, Deduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Consciousness must be *universal* goods,
</em><br>
See MY INDUCTION.
<br>
<em>&gt; in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense that *all* ethical sentients must agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are good (no sentient could claim that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not good without contradiction, since they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive processes that enable one to think and be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-aware in the first place).
</em><br>
See MY INDUCTION.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Consciousness, Values and Intelligence *are*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fundamental properties of the cosmos that need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; explained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; --- PROGRAM ANALOGY ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Really?  Is &lt;insert your favorite large computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; program here&gt; a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property of the microchip it is running on?  Try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imagining your program with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some new feature added, or some old feature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discarded and you will see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that program was not fundamental.  In the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is not hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hypothesize many different versions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness, values and intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the same way, all three of the properties you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mention are no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fundamental to the universe than the program is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the microchip.  Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; versions of these three things are complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; functional adaptations to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary environment.  AIs and aliens will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different versions by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason of different design/evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not using the word 'consciousness' to mean a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *particular kind* of consciousness.  Go look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictionary definition of 'Conscious'.
</em><br>
OK, I'll try that.
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness</a>
<br>
...&quot;Consciousness is notoriously difficult to define or locate.&quot;...
<br>
I stand by my point.
<br>
<em>&gt; It's a noun -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm talking about *consciousness itself*.  
</em><br>
As mentioned before, we do not have a definition of consciousness.  
<br>
Until we have one, particular kinds of consciousness are the only ones we can
<br>
meaningfully talk about.
<br>
See BADLY DEFINED CONSCIOUSNESS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Take your example above.  I'm not talking about *a*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular computer program, I'm talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *programs in general*.  *A* particular computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program is not fundmental, but *computation itself*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.  In fact Alan Turing's mathematical theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UNIVERSAL computation provides strong evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation is a fundamental property of the universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the sense that computation is everywhere present.
</em><br>
--- PROGRAM ANALOGY CLARIFICATION ---
<br>
That is not what I meant by the analogy.  This analogy is a mapping between
<br>
physical systems and what they do computationally, not a mapping between
<br>
conscious systems and computer programs.
<br>
<p>Talking about programs in general would be like talking about physical
<br>
systems in general.  And yes, you do get lots of nice laws.
<br>
<p>But that is not the same as talking about certain classes of programs (the
<br>
sentient ones or the ones that have values) which are not even clearly
<br>
defined subsets of the set of programs and expecting nice theorems to appear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, the general properties *intelligence*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *values* and *consciousness* could easily be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental properties of the universe as well.
</em><br>
We do not even have definitions of these things (though we may have one for
<br>
intelligence at some time in the future).  In fact, in the cases of values
<br>
and consciousness, the only basis for any conclusions are, practically by
<br>
definition, personal experiences.  Given what complex systems humans are, I
<br>
find it highly implausible for these intuitive notions to be fundamental
<br>
properties of the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The space of all logically possible sentients is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; absolutely massive!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Besides sentience itself, I very much doubt you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; find much in common.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember that minds require brains and brains are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical objects.  If there was nothing in the space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all logically possible minds, it would mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one part of physical reality would not be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interact with all other parts of physical reality in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent way.  The laws of physics themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't function.  Since the laws of physics *do*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apepar to be consistent and function the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UNIVERSALLY (as far as we can tell), there must be at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one thing that all possible minds have in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common.
</em><br>
Yes!  For example the fact that they fall at 9.8 m/s^2 when dropped out a
<br>
window on earth (barring air resistance), and many other nice laws of physics.
<br>
<p>However, this doesn't mean that the sufficiently smart minds share common
<br>
goal systems, as you appear to be arguing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You say my true nature is to be self-aware, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason and to be altruistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I might even admit that that is definition of sane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humanity's true nature, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least what we want it to be, albeit an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over-simplified one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But, to say that these are the true nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentience is another thing all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; together.  You are listing treating three distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; properties as a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; All three of these properties are probably as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; un-fundamental as the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of rice pudding and income tax.  (See PROGRAM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ANALOGY)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See above.  I pointed out a mind which cannot reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot reason about ethics.  Therefore the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason is a prequiste to ethics.  I pointed out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning depends on Induction and Deduction, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which there are well-defined theories with UNIVERSAL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applicability.  Since reasoning is needed for ethics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and since the cognitive processes needed for ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are objective, it follows that the cognitive processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed for reasoning must be *universally good*.
</em><br>
See CONSISTENCY and MY INDUCTION.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, with consciousness.  A mind which is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious is not a moral subject.  Therefore the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to be conscious is a prequiste to being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral subject.  But there's an *objective* theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness - by John Taylor - consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused by the interaction of current experience with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past memories.  Since consciousness is neeeded to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ethical subject and since the cognitive processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed for consciousness are objective, it follows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cognitive processes needed for consciousness must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be *universally good*
</em><br>
See BADLY DEFINED CONSCIOUSNESS.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ALL sentients everywhere, in order to be consistent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must conclude that the cognitive proccesses resulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in reasoning and consciousness are good.  If any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentient tried to say that these cognitive proccesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were bad, they would be contradicting themslves, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without these cognitive proccesses the sentient would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be unable to reason about ethics in the first place.  
</em><br>
See CONSISTENCY and MY INDUCTION again.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This proves Objective morality.
</em><br>
No it doesn't!
