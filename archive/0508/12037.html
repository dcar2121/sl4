<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.sl4.org/search.html">http://www.sl4.org/search.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...is mentioned prominently on the SL4 list information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; page that you must have visited when you signed up.
</em><br>
<p>But not on www.sl4.org .
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hopefully you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locate the previous discussion of why posting is (a)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (b) would defeat the point of the exercise.
</em><br>
<p>I located a posting with Eliezer's reason for keeping
<br>
the results secret.  Which he of course can do.  And while
<br>
my estimated prior for changing Eliezer's mind on this
<br>
subject is very low, I'd like to give these reasons why he
<br>
might want to:
<br>
<p>1a.  I am familiar with many independent and
<br>
well-substantiated cases of appearances of the Virgin Mary.
<br>
&nbsp;I give them small probabilities of truth, because I gave
<br>
them small priors.  I'd need details of each case to
<br>
overcome these low priors.  Likewise with the AI-box.
<br>
<p>1b.  Someone once said that a scientist is someone who,
<br>
instead of believing something because he sees it, is
<br>
someone who believes something because he has a theory for
<br>
it.  I can't construct a theory for the AI-box results
<br>
without more details of what happened.
<br>
<p>2.  I want to know whether Eliezer is using the same
<br>
&quot;trick&quot; each time.
<br>
<p>3.  The outcome is meant to suggest that, if Eliezer can
<br>
convince an arbitrary human to do something they are
<br>
dead-set against doing, then so can an AI.  But if Eliezer
<br>
had such powers, why can't he consistently convince people
<br>
on SL4 to change their views?
<br>
<p>This suggests a solution to boxing an AI:  Create a list
<br>
advocating the position that AIs will be friendly.  Wait
<br>
until that list's Marc Geddes-equivalent appears.  Have him
<br>
be the gatekeeper.
<br>
<p>4.  I'm interested in the transcripts for what they say
<br>
about human psychology.
<br>
<p>5.  Since there have been 3 experiments already,
<br>
perhaps one of them could be described in detail.
<br>
<p>At least one other participant would have to change his
<br>
mind in order to release the results.  But I'm sure Eliezer
<br>
could talk him into that.  :)
