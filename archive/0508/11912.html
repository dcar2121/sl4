<p>
I'm very interested in knowing the Theory of
<br>
Everything; I just don't know if I would
<br>
recognize it when I saw it.
<br>
One of Geddes's main contentions is that
<br>
intelligence above a certain level is inherently
<br>
altruistic. I prefer to believe this, but I don't
<br>
think it's provable pre-Singularity. I recall an
<br>
illustration in Godel, Escher, Bach. A rectangle
<br>
divided between white and black, with a fractal
<br>
border, representing true theorems and false
<br>
theorems under a formal system (in Godel's case,
<br>
Whitehead and Russell's Principia Mathematica).
<br>
Points deep in black represented theorems easily
<br>
proven false, as I recall; points deep in white,
<br>
theorems easily proven true. But the border
<br>
between true and false, being fractal, is fuzzy
<br>
at the finest levels, and represents theorems
<br>
which cannot be proven to be true or false.
<br>
<p>Let this diagram be considered as an illustration
<br>
not of theorems in a formal system, but of all
<br>
possible knowledge. I firmly assert that all
<br>
ethical judgements are epistemological: i.e. what
<br>
we believe is right and wrong depends on what we
<br>
know, what we think we know, what we believe
<br>
without proof, and so on. Each of us looks at the
<br>
world and sees a slightly different version of
<br>
that fractal diagram, some sharper, some fuzzier,
<br>
with various holes, various regions we consider
<br>
more important, or not important at all.
<br>
<p>To offer an extreme case: what blame do we assign
<br>
to a murderer who sincerely believes other people
<br>
are mere hallucinations? We normal humans are not
<br>
like him, but we do nevertheless have all sorts
<br>
of problems with that fuzzy fractal area, where
<br>
we can't be sure what is true or false, what is
<br>
right and wrong; and so we have ethicists,
<br>
judges, philosophers, priests, a whole phalanx of
<br>
paid de-fuzzers we hope will help us settle those
<br>
thorny ethical decisions along the dragon border
<br>
between should and should not.
<br>
<p>The idea that a more intelligent being at some
<br>
point undergoes a phase change to pure altruism
<br>
is very, very attractive; what does it mean in
<br>
terms of the fractal truth diagram? One must
<br>
assume, firt of all, that there is universal
<br>
truth; that my truth diagram and yours are more
<br>
alike than different, or even that they would me
<br>
utterly identical if we both could achieve
<br>
perfect knowledge. Second, we must assume that
<br>
higher intelligence, whatever form it takes,
<br>
enables its bearer to perceive more of the truth
<br>
diagram.
<br>
<p>An open question is whether any intelligence,
<br>
even a Jupiter brain, can know all there is to
<br>
know: does the fractal of undecidability continue
<br>
beyond all possible knowledge? I suspect it does,
<br>
but this may not matter; if the pure altruism
<br>
phase change exists, it may lie near the top of
<br>
actual human intelligence and be easily crossed
<br>
by any SAI.
<br>
This is pure conjecture, and it depends on what
<br>
epistemological truths are known to the entity
<br>
that sees the truth diagram of reality more
<br>
clearly than we. Perhaps ve will understand, as
<br>
clearly as we understand fire is hot and ice is
<br>
cold, that maximal altruism is both desirable and
<br>
easy for vim, and any non-altruistic behavior is
<br>
counterproductive and foolish. One might worry
<br>
that the opposite is true, and the SAI will
<br>
understand with equal clarity that the humans
<br>
have to go.
<br>
My current thinking is that Many Worlds/Platonia
<br>
is true, that all extinctions, all Screams and
<br>
Whimpers, all Singularities, all Permutation City
<br>
scenarios, and all pre-and post-Singularity
<br>
states exist in the Sim, which is in some sense
<br>
pure thought/math/dream: the ain soph or nagual
<br>
or dreamtime, if you will; that a SAI would
<br>
discover this is so; and since both we and ve are
<br>
eternal patterns, ve would so inform us. An
<br>
unsuccessful Singularity would leave us in a bad
<br>
part of the Sim; a successful Singularity would
<br>
empower us to navigate the Sim as we wish. After
<br>
that, &quot;?&quot;
