As far as I can tell, for the vast majority of the population &quot;belief&quot; means 
<br>
&quot;set of noises I make to denote tribal affiliation&quot;, not &quot;symbol mapping 
<br>
onto structure in my brain isomorphic to some practical aspect of the world 
<br>
or non-obvious logical conclusion&quot;.  In so far as most people are Bayesian 
<br>
approximators they don't use the word &quot;believe&quot; or any other words.  Us 
<br>
semantic web meme-complex get in trouble when we interpret the behaviors of 
<br>
all apes to be the result of our type of meme-complex.  First off, most apes 
<br>
probably don't have the hardware needed to host software like ourselves.  
<br>
Although they are imperfect, the links below represent what is actually 
<br>
known about typical human capabilities fairly well and with atypical 
<br>
honesty.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf">http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/1997whygmatters.pdf</a>
<br>

<br>
<p>Note that extremely complex learned behavior of a non-symbolic variety, such 
<br>
as is displayed by a mechanic, is possible with low 'g'.  Symbols are in 
<br>
such case a relatively non-central phenomenon.
<br>
<p>Also, note that even at the Harvard/Stanford level, with 'g' at least as far 
<br>
above the 90th percentile as the 90th percentile is above the 75th 
<br>
percentile (assuming an integral scale maps onto a normal or log-normal 
<br>
distribution), Wason tasks have demonstrated that Reason v. 1.0, the Ancient 
<br>
Greek pre-release version, is not really running for a fraction of the 
<br>
population that can be statistically considered to be equal to unity, (even 
<br>
those tasks which elicit correct answers elicit them only from a minority or 
<br>
a bare majority of the test audience).
