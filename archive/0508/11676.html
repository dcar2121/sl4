Eliezer said, &quot;Just because you invent a word does not give it a real
<br>
referent nor even a well-defined meaning.
<br>
What exactly is &quot;autonomy&quot;?  What are these tests that measure it?  I
<br>
cannot even conceive of such a test.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mark said, &quot;Uh, I am afraid I cannot take responsibility for making up
<br>
the term. It is often explicated in terms of having the ability to
<br>
govern one's life in absence from coercion from others.&quot;
<br>
<p>I imagine it's safe to say Eliezer's use of the word 'you' in &quot;Just
<br>
because you invent a word [...]&quot; was intended to be read as &quot;Just
<br>
because one invents a word [...]&quot;, and not you, personally, Mark.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, you [meaning Mark, not 'one', here] believe 'autonomy'
<br>
has a coherent, meaningful referent, which makes Eliezer's questions
<br>
reasonable to ask of you. I see you've pointed to the answers others
<br>
have offered regarding &quot;What is autonomy?&quot; -- but the common
<br>
explication you indicate is clearly not satisfactory. For none can
<br>
lives among others can live in -total- absence from coercion. None of
<br>
us do, to be sure, yet still you'd call us autonomous. So a certain
<br>
degree of coercion is required, not merely the presence of coercion.
<br>
But how much? And is it a switch that flips upon pushing past the
<br>
limit? A strange metaphysical beast it would be were it so. Perhaps it
<br>
is a sliding scale - one has *degrees* of autonomy, does one not? But
<br>
then we've lost our definition of autonomy, because we no longer have
<br>
a clear determinant of whether or when an agent is autonomous, or any
<br>
idea of what effect differing levels of coercion have on this nebulous
<br>
property, aside from personal whimsy.
<br>
<p>Further, related to another of Eliezer's points, what is coercion if
<br>
not causal influence? And, if it is exemplified by one agent exerting
<br>
causal influence on another, why should we be more concerned with it
<br>
than the non-agent causal influence necessarily exerted in its place
<br>
(necessarily, because all our actions are caused, ultimately be
<br>
external forces, and the only alternative to agent causation is non-)?
<br>
<p>How a term is often explicated isn't worth a damn, if it's often
<br>
explicated poorly.
