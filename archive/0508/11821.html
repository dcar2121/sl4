</em><br>
<p>In the context of containment of superhuman intelligence(s),
<br>
it is justified to suppose that there may be exploits unless
<br>
we have actual evidence strongly suggesting that there are
<br>
none.  When I program, having finished a unit of code, I have
<br>
no evidence that there are any bugs in what I've written.
<br>
Still, prudence indicates that I should *assume* that there
<br>
are bugs in my code, and write tests to catch them if they
<br>
exist.  If no bugs exist, I have not harmed myself greatly
<br>
by assuming they do.  If they do, and I assume they do not,
<br>
I will fail.
<br>
<p>All I am arguing is that prudence indicates that we should
<br>
assume that exploits exist until we have some reason to
<br>
believe they do not, such evidence consisting of a theory
<br>
of physics that appears complete and tractable.  I do not
<br>
expect to see such a theory before superhuman intelligence
<br>
(if possible), and so I think we can &quot;safely&quot; assume that
<br>
exploits exist, an assumption which, if false, will at least
<br>
not harm us.
<br>
<p>Given this, safeguards must be built into the superhuman
<br>
intelligence directly.  This, of course, is the Party
<br>
position, the common wisdom, on this list.  This is why
<br>
(I believe) people on this list keep insisting that some
<br>
exploit may exist: assuming that they do not predetermines
<br>
failure in the case that they do, while the reverse is not
<br>
true.
<br>
<p>Now, it may or may not be *probable*, with what we know
<br>
today, that exploits do exist, but just as a pack of
<br>
dogs cannot reason about a helicopter they haven't had
<br>
any experience of, I don't think we have any way to
<br>
reason about the probability of exploits within those
<br>
parts of physics we don't yet have nailed down.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; given that we know of areas that are incomplete, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; given that we know that it's possible to surprise us even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; within ostensibly complete areas, it should be obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that exploits must be assumed to exist for intelligences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; which dwarf our own (if that's possible).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you know of an &quot;exploit&quot; like the ones under discussion, I'd love 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it. I don't think you have any good reason to suppose reasonable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.
</em><br>
<p>Just to be clear, I do not know of any.  My best guess
<br>
about Eliezer's box-break involves reasoning with the
<br>
jailer about what future jailers will do, combined with
<br>
a carrot and stick.  That assumes that turning off the
<br>
AI permanently isn't an option, which is a detail I don't
<br>
actually remember.  I don't suppose I'll know for a long
<br>
time, if ever, whether my guess is close to correct.
