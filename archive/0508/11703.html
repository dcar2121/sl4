If sing inst is to be humanities last hope, it must remain focused.  At the 
<br>
very least, it must keep its attention on items which are not the subject of 
<br>
widespread attention, in other words, on items which we can realistically 
<br>
hope to impact.  Interpreted most broadly, that still doesn't include nukes, 
<br>
though it may include other technologies that FAI if they have the key 
<br>
feature of recursive self-improvement.
<br>
The chance against meteor impacts is the definition of astronomical.

<em>&gt;all of them in depth so a forum for measuring the !
