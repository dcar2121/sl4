<em>&gt;*Deep breath* because [justification is] the only way I know of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinguishing between good and bad judgments.
</em><br>
<p>People who don't know formal techniques for distinguishing between good and 
<br>
bad judgements should study rationality more before considering themselves 
<br>
to be SL4.
<br>
The difference between &quot;exploits&quot; and &quot;ninja hippos&quot; is primarily one of 
<br>
specificity and secondarily one of implication.  Relevant Ninja hippos 
<br>
occupy a very constrained and well defined realm within possibility space, 
<br>
while &quot;expolits&quot; refers to an extremely large space of possibilities which 
<br>
has not been well characterized.  In fact, it is a space defined so that it 
<br>
consists entirely of uncharacterized possibilities.  If we could 
<br>
characterize all of the options available to an SI in what is to us an 
<br>
intractible domain, we would be SIs.  Actually, in an infinite universe 
<br>
there probably are &quot;ninja hippos&quot; to the extent that &quot;ninja hippo&quot; is the 
<br>
designation of an empirical cluster of phenomena, e.g. something &quot;thingish&quot;, 
<br>
rather than being, as I suspect you at least psychologically meant it to be, 
<br>
an absurdist juxtaposition of incompatible attributes, e.g. something 
<br>
&quot;jokeish&quot;.  Distant ninja hippos are of little relevance to our planning 
<br>
however, so while the probability may be high, the probability times 
<br>
implication (impact on utility of actions) is low.  The implications are 
<br>
also not well defined, and there is little reason for thinking that they can 
<br>
be defined, so the thought experiment fails in a manner parallel to Pascal's 
<br>
wager.  Since the Kolmogorov complexity of a god or a ninja hippo which 
<br>
wants you to do X (e.g. one which changes the utility implications of any 
<br>
particular behavior in any particular way) is roughly constant across the 
<br>
space of possible values of X, and since we have no Bayesian valid evidence 
<br>
for updating our priors, nor any way of gaining such evidence, our rational 
<br>
behavior does not differ from what it would be if ninja hippos did exist.
<br>
Anyway, the serious question that parallels &quot;ninja hippos&quot;, though we are 
<br>
moving into metaphysics here is, &quot;what is the probability that the 
<br>
philosophical foundations of our implicit world-view are grossly flawed.&quot;  
<br>
Unfortunately, while the best available calibrated Bayesian answer to that 
<br>
question seems to be &quot;quite high&quot;, it doesn't seem to me that knowing this 
<br>
helps us much by suggesting a path of action.  It seems to me that if we are 
<br>
fluctuations in the quantum vacuum, or something equivalent, then we are 
<br>
just screwed, or rather, not even screwed.  Then again, it seems to me that 
<br>
Eliezer once had a roughly parallel attitude towards objective ethics, so 
<br>
the Bayesian calibrated strength of my assessment that we shouldn't worry 
<br>
about metaphysics is also not terribly high.
<br>
<p>The proper question about medieval alchemists is &quot;what would have been the 
<br>
well calibrated probability assigned to each of these assertions a) great 
<br>
wealth can be created by those with deep understanding of how the universe 
<br>
works, b) wealth in the form of gold can be likewise so created, c) it could 
<br>
be created from lead d) they could figure out how to create gold from lead 
<br>
e) they could figure it out by following a particular research program, and 
<br>
f) this is how you create gold from lead!&quot;?
<br>
At a less analytical level, they could have asked &quot;what is the expected 
<br>
return on investment from alchemy research, and how much of that return can 
<br>
I capture?&quot;
<br>
The proper question about 3 digit primes is &quot;what is the well calibrated 
<br>
probability that any particular mathematical statement which is true within 
<br>
a particular mathematical formal system will be false within some other 
<br>
practically useful system&quot;?
