<p>
<em>&gt; Once you enter into the regime of technologies powerful enough to pose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential risks, you cannot make even one mistake, or the dice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roll again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you will not hold yourself to a higher standard than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary scientist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then content yourself with an ordinary scientist's power.
</em><br>
<p><p>IMO, the appropriate standard for researchers in AGI, strong nanotech, or
<br>
other highly powerful and dangerous areas is:
<br>
<p>1) higher than the standard for scientists working in less obviously
<br>
dangerous areas
<br>
<p>2) lower than the unreasonable standard that you propose (&quot;total moral
<br>
responsibility for all indirect consequences of one's work&quot;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; An optimization process steers the future into particular regions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.  I am visiting a distant city, and a local friend volunteers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive me to the conference hotel.  I do not know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood.  When my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend comes to a street intersection, I am at a loss to predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my friend's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns, either individually or in sequence.  Yet I can predict the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend's unpredictable actions: we will arrive at the conference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hotel.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if my friend's house were located elsewhere in the city, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my friend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made a wholly different sequence of turns, I would just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidently predict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our destination.  Is this not a strange situation to be in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speaking?  I can predict the outcome of a process, without being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict any of the intermediate steps in the process.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you can't predict this outcome with certainty.  Your friend could
<br>
be hit by a bus along the way, or he could go insane, or he could be
<br>
suicidal without you knowing it and poison himself en route.  Or he could
<br>
decide the conference is boring and decide to spend the day at a bookstore
<br>
instead.  In those cases, you would not fairly be considered morally
<br>
responsible for his failure to arrive at the conference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If my friend were not intelligent, then indeed I would need a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of computing power to guess the final destination of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process as complex as my friend's brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus creating AI differs in kind from creating a hammer or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a gun, and the moral responsibilities are different also.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that the moral responsibilities are different, but I don't agree
<br>
that they are as extreme as your prior email implied.
<br>
