<p>There's an important distinction which you're missing, between a mind's
<br>
behaviors and (its beliefs about) its goal content. As human beings, we
<br>
have evolved to believe that we are altruists, and when our evolved
<br>
instincts and behaviors contradict this, we can sometimes alter these
<br>
behaviors.
<br>
<p>In other words, it is a reproductive advantage to have selfish
<br>
behaviors, so you have them, but it is also a reproductive advantage to
<br>
think of yourself as an altruist, so you do. Fortunately, your
<br>
generally-intelligent mind is more powerful than these dumb instincts,
<br>
so you have the ability to overcome them, and become a genuinely good
<br>
person. But you can only do this because you _started out_ wanting to be
<br>
a good person!
<br>
<p>You are anthropomorphizing by assuming that these beliefs about goal
<br>
content are held by minds-in-general, and the only variation is in the
<br>
instinctual behaviors built in to different minds. A Seed AI which
<br>
believes its goal to be paper clip maximization will not find
<br>
Friendliness seductive! It will think about Friendliness and say &quot;Uh oh!
<br>
Being Friendly would prevent me from turning the universe into paper
<br>
clips! I'd better not be Friendly.&quot;
