<p>
This hypothetical paperclip monster is being used in ways that are 
<br>
incoherent, which interferes with the clarity of our arguments.
<br>
<p><p><p>Hypothesis:  There is a GAI that is obsessed with turning the universe 
<br>
into paperclips, to the exclusion of all other goals.
<br>
<p>It is supposed to be so obsessed that it cannot even conceive of other 
<br>
goals, or it cannot understand them, or it is too busy to stop and think 
<br>
of them, or maybe it is incapable of even representing anything except 
<br>
the task of paperclipization...... or something like that.
<br>
<p>Anyhow, the obsession is so complete that the paperclip monster is 
<br>
somehow exempt from the constraints that might apply to a less 
<br>
monomaniacal AI.  And for this reason, the concept of a paperclip 
<br>
monster is used as a counterexample to various arguments.
<br>
<p>I submit that the concept is grossly inconsistent.  If it is a *general* 
<br>
AI, it must have a flexible, adaptive representation system that lets it 
<br>
model all kinds of things in the universe, including itself.
<br>
<p>[Aside:  AI systems that do not have that general ability may be able to 
<br>
do better than us in a narrow area of expertise (Deep Thought, for 
<br>
example), but they are incapable of showing general intelligence].
<br>
<p>But whenever the Paperclip Monster is cited, it comes across as too dumb 
<br>
to be a GAI ... the very characteristics that make it useful in 
<br>
demolishing arguments are implicitly reducing it back down to sub-GAI 
<br>
status.  It knows nothing of other goals?  Then how does it outsmart a 
<br>
GAI that does know such things?
<br>
<p>Or: it is so obsessed with paperclipization that it cannot represent and 
<br>
perceive the presence of a human that is walking up to its power socket 
<br>
and is right now pulling the plug on it .....?  I'm sure none of the 
<br>
paperclip monster supporters would concede that scenario:  they would 
<br>
claim that the monster does represent the approaching human because the 
<br>
human is suddenly relevant (it is threatening to terminate the Holy 
<br>
Purpose), so it deals with the threat.
<br>
<p>I agree, it would understand the human, it would not be so dumb as to 
<br>
mistake the intentions of the human ... because it *does* have general 
<br>
intelligence, and it *does* have the ability to represent things like 
<br>
the intentions of other sentients, and it *does* spend some time 
<br>
cogitating about such matters as intention and motivation, both in other 
<br>
sentients and in itself, and it does perceive within itself a strong 
<br>
compulsion to make paperclips, and it does understand the fact that this 
<br>
compulsion is somewhat arbitrary .... and so on.
<br>
<p>Nobody can posit things like general intelligence in a paperclip monster 
<br>
(because it really needs that if it is to be effective and dangerous), 
<br>
and then at the same time pretend that for some reason it never gets 
<br>
around to thinking about the motivational issues that I have been 
<br>
raising recently.
<br>
<p>That is what I meant by saying that the monster is having its cake and 
<br>
eating it.
<br>
<p><p>I see this as a symptom of a larger confusion:  when speculating about 
<br>
various kinds of AI, we sometimes make the mistake of positing general 
<br>
intelligence, and then selectively withdrawing that intelligence in 
<br>
specific scenarios, as it suits us, to demonstrate this or that failing 
<br>
or danger, or whatever.
<br>
<p>I am not saying that anyone is doing this deliberately or deceiptfully, 
<br>
of course, just that we have to be vary wary of that trap, because it is 
<br>
an easy mistake to make, and sometimes it is very subtle.   I have been 
<br>
attacking it, in this post, in the case of the paperclip monster, but I 
<br>
have also been trying to show that it occurs in other situations (like 
<br>
when we try to decide whether the GAI is being *subject* to a drive 
<br>
coming from its motivation or is *thinking about* a drive that it 
<br>
experiences.).
<br>
<p>Does anyone else except me understand what I am driving at here?
