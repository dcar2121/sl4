<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of curiousity, does anyone here know of *any* instance where some 
<br>
aspiration was asserted to be impossible by people who simply meant &quot;I can't 
<br>
see any way in which this could be achieved&quot; and those people turned out to 
<br>
be right?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've read &quot;biochemistry/biology can't do X&quot; literally dozens of times and 
<br>
later found instances of biology/biochemistry doing X.  Manipulate metals, 
<br>
make lenses, mirrors, semiconductors, fire, travel in space, survive at 
<br>
temperatures over the boiling point of water, live millions of years, 
<br>
survive total dehydration while retaining multi-cellular structure, catalyze 
<br>
some particular reaction, completely avoid cancer (under any conditions we 
<br>
have been able to test), repair the Y chromosome, revert to grand-parent's 
<br>
genomes, live deep under ground, utilize infra-red as an energy source, 
<br>
survive in extremely salty water, survive in the stomach, reproduce without 
<br>
DNA, evolve rapidly, hybridize and instantly create new animal species, and 
<br>
on, and on, and on.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all of that under the hideously restrictive constraints binding it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Poll of SL4
<br>
Let's play &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel&quot;
<br>
Given current human intelligence, ten million people, ten million years, and 
<br>
no human eugenics, how restrictive would you guess starting conditions would 
<br>
have to be to prevent the development of MNT?
<br>
Given Earth, no eugenics, ten million people, and ten million years, how 
<br>
large a shift in the average and/or standard deviation of intelligence would 
<br>
have prevented MNT from being developed?
<br>
<p>My personal answers;
<br>
a) a small archipelago such as Hawaii (but not volcanic enough to wipe the 
<br>
people out of course), with attendant absence of many &quot;key&quot; resources at 
<br>
concentrations that are economical for us and total absence of some other 
<br>
&quot;key&quot; resources (fossil fuels, for instance, or &quot;domesticable&quot; animals) 
<br>
would not have stopped them, but a single island too small to develop 
<br>
multiple interacting cultures might have.  Permafrost probably would have.
<br>
b)  a 2 standard deviation lower average or 1/2 current variation probably 
<br>
would have.
<br>
Half that disadvantage probably wouldn't.
