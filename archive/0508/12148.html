</em><br>
<p>The diameter of your universe is X quanta and your variables have
<br>
Y states. If Y&gt;=X, then you can parameterise the set of all possible
<br>
spatial locations into a vector of variables the same size as the
<br>
number of spatial dimensions in your universe. If Y&lt;X, there is no
<br>
lossless mapping with a set of this size. To specify exact positions
<br>
you would need to combine vectors, e.g. a coarse vector specifying
<br>
the location of a shared reference frame combined with fine vectors
<br>
specifying the exact positions of everything in that frame. Note
<br>
that this only saves you storage space if the universe is somewhat
<br>
sparse, but it will save computation if you're prepared to round
<br>
the effects of fields such that they apply equally to everything in
<br>
a given frame.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you're using true absolute co-ordinates, i.e. every particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or similar ontological primitive has a position in quanta relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to the universe itself, then your variables must have enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; range to allow speeds from 1 distance quanta/time quanta up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1 universe diameter/time quanta without any loss of precision.
</em><br>
<p>Technically 1 universe radius per time quanta.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In a Newtonian universe.  Which is why it's a bad approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a universe-simulator.
</em><br>
<p>When I said /must/, I didn't mean 'so you must meet this onerous
<br>
condition', I meant 'so clearly you already have this capability'.
<br>
If you can state the position of anything absolutely, then you can
<br>
also state the velocity of anything absolutely as long as the
<br>
maximum possible velocity measured in distance quanta / time quanta
<br>
is smaller than the radius of the universe / desired subquantum
<br>
precision. Obviously you can use the same strategy for compressing
<br>
groups of similar velocities as you can for compressing groups of
<br>
similar positions (reference frames), but again this has nothing
<br>
to do with the question of relative time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say it simplified things; it reduces the storage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and computational requirements.
</em><br>
<p>/Relativity/ greatly increases computational requirements, and
<br>
will only decrease storage requirements under a generous set of
<br>
assumptions. /Relative encoding/ is a special case of removing
<br>
redundant information, which can but is not required to incorporate
<br>
lossy compression, and is a useful technique in many real world
<br>
computing applications. The two things are not closely related.
<br>
<p>I realise you were just trying to make a humorous allusion. But
<br>
making sweeping statements about science, based on the fact that
<br>
two things the author doesn't fully understand or just hasn't taken
<br>
the time to think through seem vaugely compatible, is a bad habit
<br>
that we should all be trying to stamp out.
