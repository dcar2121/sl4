<p><em>&gt; When I program, having finished a unit of code, I have no evidence that there

<em>&gt; *assume* that there are bugs in my code, and write tests to catch them if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they exist...All I am arguing is that prudence indicates that we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that exploits exist until we have some reason to believe they do not
</em><br>
<p>But you don't assume there are bugs in your code out of prudence any more than
<br>
you would assume that there are monsters under your bed for the same reason.
<br>
You assume your code has bugs because most code does, and you don't check under
<br>
your bed for monsters because believe that most beds don't have any. For this
<br>
analogy to work, you'd have to believe that most boxes have exploits in the
<br>
sense I was discussing before (physical exploits), not in the sense you seem to
<br>
have confused my position with (psychological exploits of the jailer).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given this, safeguards must be built into the superhuman intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly. This, of course, is the Party position, the common wisdom, on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list. This is why (I believe) people on this list keep insisting that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploit may exist: assuming that they do not predetermines failure in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that they do, while the reverse is not true.
</em><br>
<p>I have less charitable reasons for why people insist on the existence of
<br>
exploits, but even if you are right, that doesn't mean that acting as though
<br>
exploits exist is automatically the rational thing to do. For example, if we
<br>
thought that there was an pretty low probability that there were exploits
<br>
existed, but that if there were we would be screwed if we didn't account for
<br>
them, although we probably could account for them if we spent an extra 20 years
<br>
before the debut of AI. In this case, given the very low probability of the
<br>
existence of exploits and the astronomical waste of 20 years without AI, it
<br>
seems like the decision to ignore the possibility of exploits has more expected
<br>
value, although I may just be reacting to my bias to avoid sure losses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, it may or may not be *probable*, with what we know today, that exploits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do exist, but just as a pack of dogs cannot reason about a helicopter they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't had any experience of, I don't think we have any way to reason about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the probability of exploits within those parts of physics we don't yet have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nailed down. 
</em><br>
<p>Which is exactly why it is paranoid to worry about exploits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just to be clear, I do not know of any [exploits]. My best guess about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's box-break involves reasoning with the jailer about what future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jailers will do, combined with a carrot and stick. 
</em><br>
<p>For those joining the debate late, the issue of whether or not the AI could
<br>
talk its way out of a box is a seperate issue from the existence of exploits.
<br>
<p>I am in the process of writing up my argument and responses to various
<br>
objections. I will post a link when I am finished, and create a wiki
<br>
subdirectory of my subscriber page where y'all can write comments.
