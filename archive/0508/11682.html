*Geddes's guns continue to blaze away at the bullet
<br>
riddled corpse of 'Collective Volition'
<br>
<p>Sl4 er's should oberve my past few posts - I scarcely
<br>
had to think much at all for my final hurrah you know
<br>
- but note that Eliezer's current 'Collective
<br>
Volition' model has been ripped to pieces.
<br>
<p>The relevant key points are summarized here:
<br>
<p>Firstly, note the clear difference between 'Collective
<br>
Volition' and 'Universal Volition'.  
<br>
<p>My definitions:
<br>
<p>Collective Volition: 
<br>
<p>Something defined by reference to all 
<br>
*currently* existing sentients in some context 
<br>
<p>Universal Volition: 
<br>
<p>Something deifned by reference to all 
<br>
*logically possible* sentients. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Note that I showed that neither individual, nor
<br>
collective volition could be at the foundation of
<br>
values:
<br>
<p>&quot;Is ‘Volition’ (indivudual or collective) the
<br>
foundation of mind? No, because one 
<br>
can ask what is it about mind that allows us to reason
<br>
<p>and think about ‘Volition’ in the first place? 
<br>
Clearly there are fundamental laws of cognition that 
<br>
determine how thought is correlated with the physical 
<br>
substrate (i.e. brain) on which thought is enacted. 
<br>
But these ‘functional laws’ (which determine how 
<br>
thought maps to physical processes) must be the same 
<br>
for all sentients and are hence objective. This shows 
<br>
that there is an objective core to cognition which 
<br>
goes beyond mere volition. Further, the *process of 
<br>
cognition itself* must be of more importance than 
<br>
volition, because we couldn’t reason about volition or
<br>
<p>act upon volition without it. For instance: when 
<br>
helping someone fulfill their desires (altruism), it 
<br>
is not only the desires of others that we value (or 
<br>
place utility on), but also *the cognitive process by 
<br>
which we reason and take action* - because without 
<br>
this cognitive process we would not be able to reason 
<br>
about or act on volition in the first place. 
<br>
<p><p>This shows that the real foundation of value judgments
<br>
<p>is not volition, but *self actualization*, the ability
<br>
<p>to reason about (be aware of) and act upon our true 
<br>
nature (‘true nature’ being the fundamental laws of 
<br>
cognition that determine how thoughts map to the 
<br>
physical substrate of our brains). But these 
<br>
fundamental laws of cognitive science which determine 
<br>
how thoughts map to brain state are objective in 
<br>
nature.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>For establishing that &quot;Self-Actualization&quot; (Learning
<br>
about and acting on our 'true nature') are the *real*
<br>
foundation for values, I elaborated on what was meant
<br>
by our 'true nature':
<br>
<p>&quot;Again, ignore all the kludges and hodge-potch
<br>
features 
<br>
of your mind. These are not part of your true nature 
<br>
as I have defined it here. 
<br>
<p>Which parts of your mind enable you to be self-aware, 
<br>
to reason and to be altruistic? *These* are your true 
<br>
nature. All the other evolutionary kludges are just
<br>
fluff.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the next thread, I explained why 'true nature' in
<br>
the sense of 'the cognitive principles required for
<br>
self-awareness and reasoning' are UNIVERSAL goods:
<br>
<p>&quot;  I pointed out a mind which cannot reason 
<br>
cannot reason about ethics. Therefore the ability to 
<br>
reason is a prequiste to ethics. I pointed out that 
<br>
reasoning depends on Induction and Deduction, for 
<br>
which there are well-defined theories with UNIVERSAL 
<br>
applicability. Since reasoning is needed for ethics, 
<br>
and since the cognitive processes needed for ethics 
<br>
are objective, it follows that the cognitive processes
<br>
<p>needed for reasoning must be *universally good*. 
<br>
<p><p>Similarly, with consciousness. A mind which is not 
<br>
conscious is not a moral subject. Therefore the 
<br>
ability to be conscious is a prequiste to being a 
<br>
moral subject. But there's an *objective* theory of 
<br>
consciousness - by John Taylor - consciousness is 
<br>
caused by the interaction of current experience with 
<br>
past memories. Since consciousness is neeeded to be 
<br>
an ethical subject and since the cognitive processes 
<br>
needed for consciousness are objective, it follows 
<br>
that cognitive processes needed for consciousness must
<br>
<p>be *universally good* 
<br>
<p>ALL sentients everywhere, in order to be consistent, 
<br>
must conclude that the cognitive proccesses resulting 
<br>
in reasoning and consciousness are good. If any 
<br>
sentient tried to say that these cognitive proccesses 
<br>
were bad, they would be contradicting themslves, since
<br>
<p>without these cognitive proccesses the sentient would 
<br>
be unable to reason about ethics in the first place.&quot;
