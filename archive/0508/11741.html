<p><em>&gt; If we can put philosophical questions aside for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment - Marc's theory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually involves a specific metamathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure, which constitutes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'formalism' of his philosophy. If this thread is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be more than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rehash of debates (about materialism vs idealism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about 'is' vs 'ought') 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which have already been conducted elsewhere, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should take a moment to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the formal side of his theory. His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'periodic table of cognition' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may just look like an array of magic words, but in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact it's logical enough. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Put crudely, his idea is that everything in reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has 7 aspects, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are 4 basic mental operations, and so a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal intellect must be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of applying each operation to each aspect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.
</em><br>
<p>Um, right.  The theory is a variant of
<br>
property-dualism whereby everything in reality has a
<br>
'7-fold' aspect - 7 different irreducible properties.
<br>
<p>As to my logic, it stems from the Godel problem
<br>
combined with the need for reality as a whole to be
<br>
*closed*.  The idea is simply that there is nothing
<br>
outside reality (if there was 'something' it would be
<br>
part of reality wouldn't it?) If want to avoid the
<br>
supernatural and want to believe that every aspect of
<br>
reality has an explanation, then it appears that the
<br>
only solution is 'break up' reality into more than one
<br>
set of math axioms, so that one  kind of math can
<br>
serve as the metalanguage for another, enabling
<br>
explanatory closure.
<br>
<p>I now think it's the 'Godel reflectivity' problem that
<br>
will automatically prevent any unfriendly AI from
<br>
self-improving.  To beat the Godel problem, I think
<br>
any AI needs to mimic the structure of reality itself
<br>
- so more than one set of math axioms is needed.  
<br>
<p>I posited 'Agency' (free will) as one of the 7
<br>
fundamental aspects of reality.  So any AI that was
<br>
*fully* self-aware (as it would need to be for
<br>
recursive self-improvement), would automatically
<br>
respect volition.
<br>
<p>Patterns in the behaviour of agents can only be
<br>
inducted if the agents behave altruistically to some
<br>
degree.  So since 'pattern is good' and altruistic
<br>
behaviour is a fundamental 'pattern' of agent
<br>
behaviour over time, volition is respected.
<br>
<p>A paper-clip maximizer would be blocked by Godel,
<br>
since it couldn't have full self-awareness and hence
<br>
couldn't recursively self-improve.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now at the Wiki, he's actually told us which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical formalism is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to each of the 7 'aspects', and he also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posits that the aspects 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form a hierarchy, in which a higher-level aspect is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented by a mapping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between representations of two lower-level aspects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are four 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bottom-level aspects, two middle-level aspects, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one top-level aspect. 
</em><br>
<p>Right.  The 3 middle and top level forms of math are
<br>
'meta-languages' which analyze and connect the 4 lower
<br>
level forms of math together.  The top-level kind of
<br>
math can serve as it's own metalanguage (logical
<br>
closure achieved at the top level).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The relevant mathematics is quite familiar:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability theory, game theory, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculus, propositional logic. Similarly, he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposes familiar formalisms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g. fuzzy logic) for the implementation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic mental operations. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, regardless of how you feel about his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphysics, regardless of whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you even understand it (I think I'm only getting it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fragments), there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually an AI specification hidden in there (or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, a specification 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a class library), and I would like to see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teased out and restated in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophically neutral terms that would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehensible to any computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist. This is not to say that the metaphysics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unimportant, but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical conversation will move to a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; octave if we can get the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalism in view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think I've identified the kind of math relevant
<br>
to each of the 7 aspects.  But there I think my time
<br>
on the SL4 list really has to end.  I've pissed
<br>
everyone off too much ;)  It remains to be seen
<br>
whether my theory leads anywhere.  I shall try to
<br>
develop it further and may be write a book or post
<br>
various essays elsewhere.
<br>
<p>As to Eliezer and his theories:  the boy's not even
<br>
close.
<br>
<p>Any way, see ya for now.
