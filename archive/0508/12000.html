<em>&gt; Richard Loosemore provides a particularly clear example of this

</em><br>
<em>&gt; SL4 concepts remotely well enough to judge them or contribute to them.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was not clear that he did know anything else.  People on the list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded by arguing politely, explaining points, and in general 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treating him in a friendly fasion.  Then, when he asserted his erudition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and Bayesians should have outgrown absolute objections to arguments 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from authority) suddenly people  became aggressive about putting him in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his place.
</em><br>
<p>Bayesians are just supposed to judge issues of fact correctly.  Probability 
<br>
theory doesn't tell you how to configure your emotions, unless your emotions 
<br>
are interfering with your perception of simple facts, in which case 
<br>
probability theory says only that this is illegal.  The Way does not tell you 
<br>
what to eat, who to sleep with, how to dress, or how to feel about the simple 
<br>
facts you have just apprehended - the art of rationality is about determining 
<br>
the state of the world, not binding emotions to states of the world.
<br>
<p>As for why people became more aggressive... that's easy, it's because it's one 
<br>
thing to perceive that someone is wrong, quite another to perceive that 
<br>
someone is wrong and trying to pull rank about it.
<br>
<p>One may see in my own response-in-kind to Loosemore that I didn't think his 
<br>
original message was stupid.  When people spend their whole lives being the 
<br>
smartest person in the room, they naturally tend to develop a statistically 
<br>
correct prior probability to which I am an exception.
<br>
<p>It occurred to me some time ago, pondering Fun Theory, that life would never 
<br>
become boringly easy for humankind as long as we could make things difficult 
<br>
for each other.  When Nick Hay started talking about category theory in #sl4, 
<br>
I learned the rudiments of category theory, because I was too proud to allow 
<br>
Nick Hay to know something I didn't.  Two years ago, say, I probably wouldn't 
<br>
have judged that a legitimate motivation, and I would have cast out the 
<br>
feeling from myself.  In which case I wouldn't presently know the rudiments of 
<br>
category theory and I would never have encountered a whole new interesting way 
<br>
to look at math.
<br>
<p>Of course one does have to be careful to respond appropriately, by learning 
<br>
the new science once one becomes interested enough to feel ashamed of not 
<br>
knowing it.  If instead you react by putting down the other person, then this 
<br>
is bad pride.  You can tell it's bad pride because it's not making you learn 
<br>
math.  There's something to be said for the Red Queen's Race of constructive 
<br>
pride, precisely because it *is* open-ended.  Open-ended constructive human 
<br>
impulses are fun.  Why shouldn't swords clash on SL4, if afterward we find a 
<br>
diamond or two lying on the ashes of the battlefield?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am a firm believer of putting people in their place.  It avoids much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasted time AND greatly increases the degree of respect that you will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recieve from the truly ignorant.  It is much more likely that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uninformed will actually read the articles that you tell them to if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are condescending or dictatorial about it.  However, the older and more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledgable someone is, the less likely this strategy is to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive.  When experts or near experts have read your introductory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writings and have gotten key points grossly wrong without realizing it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this means that you have a chance to gain skills that will be vitally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important when it comes time to approach other experts who haven't even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read your introductory writings.  It is precisely the experts who most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need outreach, as these are the people most likely to actually help if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can get through to them.
</em><br>
<p>We'll see how Richard Loosemore reacts.  It's always nice to have another 
<br>
semi-polymath on the list, especially a good writer willing to write long 
<br>
replies, and he seems like he'd be a nice person once caught up.  He came in 
<br>
and immediately opened fire on what he perceived to be scientifically 
<br>
illiterate anthropomorphism, which is fair enough, but if he can't take the 
<br>
return fire, begone to him.  I hope Loosemore hangs around, given that he is 
<br>
in fact the sort of person who hangs around, and hope he leaves, given that he 
<br>
is the sort of person who would leave.  Some filters are self-organizing.
<br>
<p>If I approach an expert or near-expert with an unsolicited email, I may treat 
<br>
them gingerly.  There are people in this world who treat all comers with 
<br>
kindness and respect, and expect politeness in return.  I'm not such a person 
<br>
myself, but I respect them, and sometimes I wish I were one of their number. 
<br>
But when an expert or near-expert walks in and opens fire, they'd better be 
<br>
able to handle my return fire.  Little sympathy do I have for they who expect 
<br>
unconditional kindness and do not give it in return.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, I've seen no sign as yet that Loosemore falls into this 
<br>
category.  He may underestimate the condescension he dished out and 
<br>
overestimate the condescension he received in return, but that is an 
<br>
experimentally proven universal; people who feel someone push against their 
<br>
hands, told to push back by the same amount, push an average of 43% harder.
<br>
<p>Maybe we should try to respond only one-third as harshly as we believe we 
<br>
ourselves are being treated, so that the sequence converges instead of 
<br>
diverges.  I'll have to think about that point.  It wasn't in my mind at the 
<br>
time I first fired back at Loosemore, so perhaps I made the wrong decision. 
<br>
Personally I was going, &quot;Yay, another person who can give and take a little 
<br>
harshness.&quot;
