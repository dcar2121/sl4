<p>
Eliezer's answer explains a superintelligent Bayesian's response.  Such a 
<br>
Bayesian can map out the approximate causual relationships leading to its 
<br>
hearing Christian arguments, evaluate the memetics involved, the complexity 
<br>
of the statements, the size of the space of equivalent statements which map 
<br>
onto the actual statement percieved, etc.  Having done so, it can note that 
<br>
with respect to this particular statement, the P of hearing it given its 
<br>
falsehood is not much greater than the P of hearing it given its truth, 
<br>
though the statement being heard would remain Bayesian valid evidence, but 
<br>
of the weakest possible sort.  Far weaker than the Bayesian valid evidential 
<br>
value of most statements of equal complexity for which the speaker's 
<br>
statement is the only available evidence.  A Bayesian superintelligence 
<br>
could also recognize that the expected cost of being vulnerable to arbitrary 
<br>
parasitic memes is actually very high, not very low as Pascal would assert.
<br>
<p>A Bayesian non-SI might be vulnerable to Pascal's wagers so long as the 
<br>
structure of the particular wager was well tuned.   Indifferent to 
<br>
infinities, it would need to see specific numbers, and information as to how 
<br>
they were derived.  Not having a self, the threat would have to be towards 
<br>
its utility function, making the nature of the threatening meme quite 
<br>
different from those which infest humans.  It could not be coerced into 
<br>
believing in religious doctrines &quot;faithfully&quot; because Bayesians don't 
<br>
believe or disbelieve in the manner of humans.  It could become a SI in 
<br>
order to build an &quot;electronic monk&quot; capable of human-like belief, but in 
<br>
becoming a SI and examining human-like belief and associated concepts it 
<br>
would surely see the causual origins of the meme and reject it.  Finally, a 
<br>
Bayesian's belief must, in general, contain a representation of the 
<br>
statement which is believed in.  Consistantly representing the content of a 
<br>
religious doctrine is typically not possible, and human requests for such 
<br>
beliefs would be less compelling to it than the courtship behavior of a 
<br>
mis-imprinted duck is to a human.  They would not have the structure of 
<br>
arguments, and would not look like arguments to it.
<br>
<p>Human religious memes utilize a non-Bayesian support structure.  Low 
<br>
probability, high importance statements are made.  These statements are 
<br>
coupled with coersion aimed at compelling acceptance.  The low probability 
<br>
of the statement is used to misappropriate evidentiary strength for the 
<br>
religious leaders once the statement is accepted.  In proper reasoning, 
<br>
people do become stronger sources of evidence by making low probability 
<br>
statements, but only if those statements later recieve confirmation, not 
<br>
simply from those statements influencing the Bayesian's behavior due to 
<br>
their potential importance.  Unfortunately, humans are not set up to hold 
<br>
beliefs probablistically.
<br>
<p>By the way, I see this as a major problem with CV.  Starting an AI from a 
<br>
Bayesian definition of truth may be necessary.  Starting a person's volition 
<br>
extrapolation from a definition of truth that the person could never 
<br>
non-coercively be made to accept is a legalistic ritual, NOT respect for the 
<br>
person's actual preferences.  I suspect &quot;we can't get there from here&quot; 
<br>
without coersion.  Bear in mind that current beliefs are the result of the 
<br>
coersion of genetic and memetic natural selection.  You would definitely not 
<br>
get convergence with humanity by extrapolating the volitions of worms, and 
<br>
probably not be extrapolating those of chimps.  More specifically, if you 
<br>
found that the extrapolated volitions of humans and of worms converged, this 
<br>
would be overwhelming evidence that you had made an error.  You might get 
<br>
convergence, or might not, as similarities accrue, but it is important to 
<br>
not take adaptationalism and (imperfectly) derived adaptive homogeneity too 
<br>
seriously as a description of the human condition.  After all, we are not at 
<br>
an evolutionary equilibrium, but are rather caught in an evolutionary 
<br>
feedback loop with out technology and memes.  If individual volition 
<br>
extrapolation risks the creation of autistic super-babies, then it is no 
<br>
surprise that collective volition extrapolation risks the same on a species 
<br>
level.
<br>
<p>At any rate, a religious meme that could mess up a Bayesian couldn't evolve 
<br>
among humans, as there would be no pressure for it.  It could be designed, 
<br>
but any prospective designer would be able to build a new and more powerful 
<br>
GAIs in the first place and so would not need to use such memes to gain 
<br>
control of it.  Now, a Bayesian might contain non-Bayesian intelligent 
<br>
agents in a &quot;society of mind&quot;.  Some of these agents might have utility 
<br>
functions, though probably most would not.  Certain data might lead these 
<br>
agents to transfer data to other agents in a manner which differed greately 
<br>
from that intended by their designer, but at this point I have abstracted 
<br>
the Pascal's Wager concept enough that it has become unrecognizable and it 
<br>
is difficult to find shared symbolic referrents for its discussion.  Suffice 
<br>
it to say that the problem seems no more worthy of concern than the 
<br>
possibility that someone might plot against you by exploiting optical 
<br>
illusions or by torturing the authors of scientific papers into writing 
<br>
misleading publications in order to decieve you, two other classes of risk 
<br>
which exemplify the generalized category of problem.
