<p>
The fear of UFAIs is based on the idea that they'll be able
<br>
to outthink us, and to do so quickly.
<br>
<p>&quot;More intelligent&quot; thinking is gotten
<br>
by adding another layer of abstraction onto a representational
<br>
system, which causes the computational tractability of reasoning
<br>
to increase in a manner that is exponential in the number
<br>
of things being reasoned about.  Or, by adding more knowledge,
<br>
which has the same effect on tractability.
<br>
<p>By limiting the computational power available to an AI to be
<br>
one or two orders of magnitude less than that available to a
<br>
human, we can guarantee that it won't outthink us - or, if it
<br>
does, it will do so very, very slowly.
<br>
There are many cases where someone has come up with a new
<br>
algorithm that has lower computational complexity than the
<br>
previously-known algorithm, but I don't think any algorithm
<br>
will be found for general intelligence that doesn't have the
<br>
property that exponential increases in resources are needed
<br>
for a linear increase of some IQ-like measure.
<br>
<p>If the AI gets out and is able to harness the computational
<br>
power on the internet, that would be different.  But within
<br>
its box, it's going to remain at or less than the order of
<br>
magnitude of intelligence dictated by its computational capacity.
