</em><br>
<em>&gt; and some people with the ability to manage those people
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>NASA was trying to solve, as a matter of engineering, a problem whose 
<br>
fundamental physics were well-understood.

<p><em>&gt; AI has too many lone wolves who are determined to do

<p>Bringing order out of scientific chaos is oft-done by teams, but also oft-done 
<br>
by Luke Skywalkers; such is the lesson of history.  Why?  One overlooked 
<br>
reason, I suspect, is that once someone latches on to a piece of the problem 
<br>
they have an advantage in figuring out the rest also, a first-mover effect. 
<br>
But also because quite often you *do* need to fit all the knowledge into one 
<br>
person's head.  Some knowledges can only be properly collated using 
<br>
intercortical bandwitdth, not interpersonal bandwidth.  In AI it's not so much 
<br>
a matter of collation as knowing, for each of the necessary fields, how not to 
<br>
make the mistakes which that field knows about.
