<p>I think his point was that the class of phenomena which we would call
<br>
&quot;exploits&quot; is much larger than the class of phenomena which we would
<br>
call &quot;ninja hippos.&quot;
<br>
<p>By the way, it doesn't really make sense to speak of the Kolmogorov
<br>
complexity of a set of possible outcomes as a means to determine the
<br>
probability that the actual outcome will fall within that set.
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity is only useful for assigning priors to *specific*
<br>
outcomes.
<br>
<p>For example, given the sequence 1, 2, ...,
<br>
<p>the statement &quot;3 or 4 is next&quot; is less complex than the statement &quot;3, 4,
<br>
or 5 is next,&quot; but clearly the latter statement at least as likely as
<br>
the former. It would make more sense to compare the Kolmogorov
<br>
complexity of &quot;1, 2, 3&quot; with the Kolmogorov complexity of &quot;1, 2, 4&quot; and
<br>
&quot;1, 2, 5.&quot;
<br>
<p>Given infinite resources, what you should REALLY do is generate all
<br>
possible programs, ordered by size, and assign a prior to each program:
<br>
maybe something like 2^-n, where n is the index of the program (starting
<br>
with 1). Then the probability that the next digit is 3 is the sum of the
<br>
priors of all programs whose output begins with &quot;1, 2, 3,&quot; divided by
<br>
the sum of the priors of all programs whose output begins with &quot;1, 2.&quot;
