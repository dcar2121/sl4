<p>
If we can put philosophical questions aside for a moment - Marc's theory 
<br>
actually involves a specific metamathematical structure, which constitutes 
<br>
the 'formalism' of his philosophy. If this thread is to be more than a 
<br>
rehash of debates (about materialism vs idealism, about 'is' vs 'ought') 
<br>
which have already been conducted elsewhere, we should take a moment to 
<br>
understand the formal side of his theory. His 'periodic table of cognition' 
<br>
may just look like an array of magic words, but in fact it's logical enough. 
<br>
Put crudely, his idea is that everything in reality has 7 aspects, that 
<br>
there are 4 basic mental operations, and so a universal intellect must be 
<br>
capable of applying each operation to each aspect of reality.
<br>
<p>Now at the Wiki, he's actually told us which mathematical formalism is 
<br>
relevant to each of the 7 'aspects', and he also posits that the aspects 
<br>
form a hierarchy, in which a higher-level aspect is represented by a mapping 
<br>
between representations of two lower-level aspects. There are four 
<br>
bottom-level aspects, two middle-level aspects, and one top-level aspect. 
<br>
The relevant mathematics is quite familiar: probability theory, game theory, 
<br>
calculus, propositional logic. Similarly, he proposes familiar formalisms 
<br>
(e.g. fuzzy logic) for the implementation of the basic mental operations. 
<br>
So, regardless of how you feel about his metaphysics, regardless of whether 
<br>
you even understand it (I think I'm only getting it in fragments), there is 
<br>
actually an AI specification hidden in there (or at least, a specification 
<br>
of a class library), and I would like to see it teased out and restated in 
<br>
philosophically neutral terms that would be comprehensible to any computer 
<br>
scientist. This is not to say that the metaphysics is unimportant, but the 
<br>
philosophical conversation will move to a higher octave if we can get the 
<br>
formalism in view.
