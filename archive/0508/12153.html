<p>And past unfriendliness as well is no indication of future unfriendliness. So
<br>
why bother trying to build a friendly AI in the first place? Suppose it were
<br>
easier to build UFAI than FAI. I'd say this is reasonable, as &quot;Make everything
<br>
cupcakes&quot; is more straightforward than &quot;Give us Apotheosis.&quot; So, we have a
<br>
better chance of achieving FAI by building UFAI.

<p>Maybe you're just way, way smarter than me.

<p><em>&gt; Any moral system evolves over time as complexity is introduced and new

</em><br>
<p>If you want to generalize from legal systems, you raise the questions:
<br>
<p>1. How often do legal systems go from 'friendly' to 'unfriendly?'
<br>
<p>2. Of the instances of legal systems going from 'friendly' to 'unfriendly¸' how
<br>
many were the result of the judges (or whoever was in charge) misguided
<br>
good-faith efforts to carry out the spirit of the system, as opposed to
<br>
intentionally perverting the system for some reason or other?

<p><em>&gt; It is widely recognised that a child may be incapable of distinguishing

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; any differently?  
</em><br>
<p>Because AIs are not children. Why should we accept your analogy? If I propose
<br>
that, since rocks are incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong
<br>
because they do not understand morality in sufficient depth, why should
<br>
limited AIs be treated differently, I must have a compelling argument as to why
<br>
the case of rocks sheds any light on the case of limited AIs. Thus when you say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we make the assumption that an intelligence-limited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI is a reasonable approximation of a child, then limiting it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless 
</em><br>
<p>You are quite right, but it isn't clear that we need to make that assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the AI must either be designed from scratch to have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-human morals to match its super-human intelligence, kept in a box 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for its entire existence, or never built in the first place.  
</em><br>
<p>So 'super-human morals' would guarantee that a currently friendly AI would
<br>
remain friendly? What, then are super-human morals? Are they amenable to any
<br>
analysis other than &quot;that which would guarantee that a currently friendly AI
<br>
remain friendly?&quot;
