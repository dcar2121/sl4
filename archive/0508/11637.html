<p>The waste of 20 years is unlikely to be important in the grand scheme of things with heaven and hell still in doubt, unless that twenty year period represents the closing of a cosmological window in which we could have done something like alter the topology of the universe from an open to a a desired closed state.  The debut of AGI is properly weighed against the debut of Molecular Manufacturing, any new technologies which hasten either or both of these, and all the other hundreds of low probability risks which would impact society enough to disrupt AGI/MM.  The latter occurs 1%-10% per decade and is rising in time.
