<em>&gt;&gt; Nobody can posit things like general intelligence in a paperclip 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; monster (because it really needs that if it is to be effective and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dangerous), and then at the same time pretend that for some reason it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; never gets around to thinking about the motivational issues that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have been raising recently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This discussion is obscured by the use of concepts from human psychology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as 'obsession', 'motivation', and 'pleasure'. It's functionalism in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverse: instead of presuming that belief, desire, etc. are completely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterized by a quasi-cybernetic description, here one is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropomorphizing a complex homeostatic mechanism and then attempting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reason about its imputed psychology. Most of your critics accept the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validity of shuttling back and forth between psychological and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cybernetic descriptions, and have asked you to think about various 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhuman psychologies. I would ask you to abandon psychologizing entirely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a moment
</em><br>
<p>The discussion is not obscured by this issue.  I am using such terms 
<br>
advisedly, because they pertain to a type of mechanism (note: mechanism, 
<br>
not metaphysical or nonphysical entity) that I am trying to bring into 
<br>
the discussion.
<br>
<p>I, like most cognitive scientists, can use such terms as shorthand for 
<br>
those mechanisms because we have a pluralistic grasp of distinctions 
<br>
between mechanisms and philosophy, and do not get confused between the 
<br>
two.  If you are confused please feel free to translate into some 
<br>
neutral language of your choice BUT please do not mistranslate into 
<br>
mechanisms that are different than the ones I am referring to.  There 
<br>
has been enough mistranslation of my arguments already (see separate 
<br>
post this evening).
<br>
<p>This is not anthropomorphizing, or psychologizing, or functionalism in 
<br>
reverse, and none of my arguments depend on vague appeals to psychology, 
<br>
except where &quot;psychology&quot; refers to mechanisms.  You may get the feeling 
<br>
that they do, but this is not so:  look more closely and extract an 
<br>
example, please.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; I would ask you to abandon psychologizing entirely
</em><br>
<em> &gt; for a moment, and think about this entity as a *machine* - a homeostatic
</em><br>
<em> &gt; system with advanced capabilities for calculation, adaptation, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; preemptive self-modification. It does nothing out of feeling,pleasure,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; or desire. It does not have motivations or goals. It is as empty of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; consciousness as a mirror, and the creation of a new level of feedback
</em><br>
<em> &gt; will not automatically render it benign, any more than will the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; introduction of a second mirror make a reflected figure smile in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; self-recognition.
</em><br>
<p>You make assertions about radical materialism that are highly debatable, 
<br>
easily challenged, crucially dependent on your own choice of the 
<br>
meanings of such terms as &quot;feeling&quot;, and irrelevant to the discussion.
<br>
<p>Then, you imply that I was making the rather foolish, Artificial 
<br>
Intelligence 101 kind of claim that &quot;the creation of a new level of 
<br>
feedback will [] render it benign&quot; and you impressionistically use your 
<br>
assertion to conclude that I am wrong.
<br>
<p>Not going to wash.
<br>
<p>Later, much later, we could have the C-word discussion.  Maybe.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S. Sorry if I appear grumpy, Mitchell.  See other post, and also the 
<br>
time stamp on this message.  I am battle-weary.
