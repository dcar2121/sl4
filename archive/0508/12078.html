<em>&gt; Novamente LLC's application for funding under this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program was rejected, as I learned a few weeks ago.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular rejection came with zero explanation.
</em><br>
<p>The solicitation, in thrust B, seemed to ask for models
<br>
of brain areas, whereas in private email Tom Armour told
<br>
me that they absolutely don't want any models of brain
<br>
areas.  I think you told me you wrote to thrust A?  I
<br>
didn't ask about thrust A, but it might also be that what
<br>
they were looking for was not really what was described
<br>
in the solicitation.
<br>
<p>It is very important to talk to the program managers
<br>
before sending in your proposal, especially on a BAA.
<br>
<p>DARPA IPTO is aware that neuroscience has something to
<br>
offer, but they want somebody else to deal with that
<br>
aspect, and DARPA money to go to more traditional
<br>
AI-people who abstract and apply that knowledge.
<br>
Remember, the head of IPTO is Ron Brachman.
<br>
<p>My application was also rejected.  Good reviews, but
<br>
no acceptance.  I suspect the budget was a problem;
<br>
my subcontractor's cost multiplier was a little too high.
<br>
Using a Canadian subcontractor may also have cost
<br>
me points.  But mainly, my company's lack of a track
<br>
record is always the one big strike against it quoted
<br>
by reviewers.  I now think it's better to get JUST ONE
<br>
contract, anywhere, from anyone, before going after
<br>
grants.  And that is what I'll do when I re-start my
<br>
startup.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This second rejection drove home the well-known fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such funding is allotted on political grounds as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific/technical grounds.  (And my own &quot;political&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections are not null, but nor are they the best in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the business....)
</em><br>
<p>I worked for IAI for 5 years, and won 6 grants, and had
<br>
no connections.  IAI has few connections, and has
<br>
won hundreds of grants.
<br>
<p>I suggest looking at SBIRs, where connections count
<br>
for very little.  The kind of connections you need
<br>
for bigger contracts aren't political connections,
<br>
but name recognition, a proven track record, and
<br>
a history of working with some of the bigger contractors.
<br>
Ben, you probably know this already.
<br>
I think having a recognized name, good references
<br>
from people at companies with recognized names, or being
<br>
a silver-tongued devil, count for more than connections,
<br>
at least when your projects are less than eight figures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I note that I have successfully achieved government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grants and contracts on many occasions, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently -- but for narrow-AI work (such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bioinformatics or language processing), not AGI work.
</em><br>
<p>The DARPA program managers sometimes want AGI-like stuff,
<br>
but they have to sell their programs.  When you talk
<br>
to the people who the DARPA program managers have to
<br>
sell their programs to about what they really need,
<br>
what comes up is that they want something like what
<br>
they've got, but easier to use.  They already think
<br>
Soar is too complicated.  The Army likes finite-state
<br>
automata.  Create a better interface than One-SAF for
<br>
building finite-state automata, make it compliant with
<br>
One-SAF and HLA, and you've got a sale.
<br>
<p>DARPA is, in any case, committed to ideas about
<br>
modular design, re-usability, interoperability, and
<br>
backwards-compatibility, that you have to operate within.
<br>
Some good work can be done this way.  IAI is still
<br>
working with DARPA to improve the MAGIC (Multi-Agent
<br>
Generic Infrastructure for Cognition) system that I
<br>
co-designed for DARPA.  Now Lockheed Martin, and Jeff
<br>
Hawkin's Redwood Institute, are also involved.  I'm so
<br>
proud of my baby!  Even if it is a modular
<br>
design incompatible with dynamic systems theory.
<br>
It's still a large improvement on the state of the art.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My application
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referred to various prior publications and also material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available online, but I doubt the reviewers took the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to dig through all this stuff enough to fully appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the underlying ideas....
</em><br>
<p>Not only won't reviewers do that;
<br>
you're lucky if they read past the second page.
<br>
Their eyes will glance over it, but if you don't
<br>
grab them in the first couple of pages, you're lost.
