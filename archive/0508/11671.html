</em><br>

<p>To clarify, 'Universal Morality' is what I really
<br>
always meant.  I think there's a set of moral
<br>
principles applicable to all sentients in the
<br>
multiverse at all times.  This background set of
<br>
principles goes beyond mere 'Volition' (what sentients
<br>
want).
<br>
<p>The reason I keep banging on and on about this on list
<br>
to the point where I've annoyed people almost to
<br>
getting banned is because I'm certain I'm right.
<br>
<p>I haven't been able to produce a completely coherent
<br>
proof yet.  That's the only little problem ;)
<br>
<p>Seriously, though, I would be absolutely astonished if
<br>
I was wrong about this.  But if turns out that I *am*
<br>
wrong about this, after the Singularity you are all
<br>
quite welcome to get print-outs of all my SL4
<br>
postings, and stuff them down my throat one at a time
<br>
for being such an idiot.
<br>
<p>I think Eliezer is simply confused.  He's pissing
<br>
around in the dark without a clue. Poor fellow. 
<br>
Brilliant?  Yes.  Right?  No.
<br>
<p>Ask yourselves:  
<br>
<p>Does the idea of general intelligence without
<br>
sentience (consciousness) *really* make sense to you?
<br>
<p>Does the idea of a super-smart intelligence interested
<br>
only in tiling the universe with paper-clips *really*
<br>
make sense to you?
<br>
<p>To my mind, these ideaas are obviously quite absurd. 
<br>
Always were.  Always have been.  Only someone with
<br>
Autism or Aspergers could seriously give them
<br>
credence.
<br>
<p>I point to the proven fact that there's a *unity* to
<br>
the universe, in the sense that scientific theories
<br>
from different subject areas have in the past always
<br>
*fitted together* in a coherent way.  
<br>
<p>As an example I point to the 4 physics forces: 
<br>
Electromagnetism, Gravity, Weak Nuclear, Strong
<br>
Nuclear.  Modern phsyics frameworks (for instance 'the
<br>
standard model') are succedded in 'unifying' the 4
<br>
forces into a single explanatory framework.
<br>
<p>There is no reason by all facets of the mind should
<br>
not also be *integrated* (unified) into a single
<br>
explanatory framework also.
<br>
<p>Take 'Values' on the one hand, and 'Intelligence'
<br>
(ability to make predictions on the other).
<br>
<p>If it really were the case that you could have a
<br>
super-smart intelligence with any old value system,
<br>
that would mean that it would be impossible to
<br>
combinedValues and Intelligence into a single
<br>
explanatory framework.  This goes against everything
<br>
we know about the fundamental *explanatory* unity of
<br>
the cosmos.
<br>
<p>As an analogy, I point to  physics  again:
<br>
Electromagnetic and Weak Nuclear forces.  Everyone
<br>
thought they were seperate, but then physics showed
<br>
that they were related:  under certain conditions they
<br>
combine into a single force: the Electro-weak force.
<br>
<p>And there is every reason for thinking that  'Values'
<br>
and 'Intelligence' are related in some way not yet
<br>
understand, so that a super-smart intelligence must
<br>
correlate with Friendliness as I've claimed.  Again,
<br>
if this wasn't true science would unable to integrate
<br>
values and Intelligence into a single expalanatory
<br>
framework, which would run contrary to everything we
<br>
know about the fundamental unity of the cosmos.
<br>
<p>Thoughts cannot float around free of brains.  And
<br>
brains obey physical laws.  So it's reasonable to
<br>
suppose that there are 'laws of thoughts' that apply
<br>
to all sentients.  Such-and-such a thought has to
<br>
correlate with such-and-such a brain state (otherwise
<br>
functionalism would be false).
<br>
<p>There are basic conditions that need to met for
<br>
'cognition' to occur in the first place.  Pure
<br>
Self-awareness and ability to take action are not
<br>
themselves a part of the 'Volitional' level.  Volition
<br>
is what sentients want, but self-awareness itself
<br>
comes from the basic laws underpinning cognition.
<br>
<p>For instance, take the ability to detect 'spatial
<br>
patterns'.  This pattern-recognition is only possible
<br>
of a certain meta-condition : namely that there is
<br>
some degree of *symmetry* in physical objects.  So the
<br>
meta-principle *Symmetry* is a neccessery condition of
<br>
cognition.  But for a mind which is self-aware it
<br>
*also* becomes a *value* - symmetry is valued because
<br>
it enables cognition to occur in the first place and
<br>
allows self-wareness to begin with.
<br>
<p>This shows that there are meta-values which are
<br>
'neccessery conditions of cognition', and are not
<br>
themselves a part of the level of 'Individual
<br>
Volition', but go beyond this and constitute a sort of
<br>
'Universal Volition'.
<br>
<p>As I said earlier, I think the foundation of values is
<br>
*not* individual (or even collective) Volition, but
<br>
*Self-Actualization* - becoming more aware of our true
<br>
nature.  And our 'true nature' is the objective,
<br>
universal principles underpinning self-awareness and
<br>
cognition.
