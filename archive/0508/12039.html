I don't believe that there is anything ironic about that.  We are all 
<br>
Bayesian approximators in so far as we are rational at all, and due to 
<br>
biological constraints, especially the indeterminacy of subjective 
<br>
probabilities, no human is a Bayesian.  For these reasons I would say that 
<br>
Loosemore shows very strong signs of not being a Bayesian and of being a 
<br>
Bayesian approximator.  As such, he has some likelihood of reaching 
<br>
conclusions based on Bayesian valid evidence and although such conclusions 
<br>
will be held with confidences which do not correspond to the subjective 
<br>
probabilities with which he would be advised to hold them, they will still 
<br>
generally contain useful information of the same type as the information 
<br>
contained in the conclusions of self-described &quot;Bayesians&quot; in almost all 
<br>
practical situations.
<br>
The position that explicitly Bayesian reasoning is a practical path to 
<br>
general intelligence is highly controvercial to say the least.  It seems to 
<br>
me to be a reasonable working hypothesis because it contributes to the 
<br>
transparency which is probably necessary for the creation of FAI, but such 
<br>
agreement with SIAI party line on this issue is not a reasonable criterion 
<br>
for assessing a person's rationality or basic competence.  Like yellow 
<br>
shirts however, it is a more than adequate criterion for defining an 
<br>
in-group and an out-group.  Lets be extremely careful not to make it one.

<em>&gt;&gt;I think the condecension Loosemore recieved exceeded that he dished out, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and worse, provided Bayesian rational evidence, from his perspective, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;we were defensive and argumentative non-truth-seekers.
