<em>&gt; 1a.  I am familiar with many independent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-substantiated cases of appearances of the Virgin Mary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I give them small probabilities of truth, because I gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them small priors.  I'd need details of each case to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome these low priors.  Likewise with the AI-box.
</em><br>
<p>The prior is low because the hypotheses 'it is a fake' and
<br>
'it's random chance', the first well supported by experience
<br>
and the second well supported by statistics, are much more
<br>
likely than 'there is a supernatural entity contradicting
<br>
all known physics that decided to create pattern X in location
<br>
Y'. What's the competing hypothesis for AI-box, and what
<br>
support gives it such a high probability? What other reasons
<br>
do you have for doubting the 'humans are easily convinced of
<br>
things they don't expect to be convinced of' hypothesis?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1b.  Someone once said that a scientist is someone who,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of believing something because he sees it, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who believes something because he has a theory for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. I can't construct a theory for the AI-box results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without more details of what happened.
</em><br>
<p>You can't construct a specific theory of what happened.
<br>
But the aim is not to make a specific prediction. The aim
<br>
is simply to predict if a prepared, intelligent person can
<br>
be convinced. Given the likely difference between the
<br>
specifics here and the specifics of any real encounter, the
<br>
the extra predictive power gained by building a more
<br>
detailed model of these encounters is probably marginal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  I want to know whether Eliezer is using the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;trick&quot; each time.
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, are you using the same trick each time?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 3. The outcome is meant to suggest that, if Eliezer can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince an arbitrary human to do something they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead-set against doing, then so can an AI.  But if Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had such powers, why can't he consistently convince people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on SL4 to change their views?
</em><br>
<p>Again, this isn't the aim of the experiment, and this
<br>
much more general prediction would be harder to make or
<br>
justify. The question is whether the very specific action
<br>
of letting an AGI of unknown ethics out of a box is something
<br>
that people can be convinced to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This suggests a solution to boxing an AI:  Create a list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocating the position that AIs will be friendly.  Wait
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until that list's Marc Geddes-equivalent appears. Have him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the gatekeeper.
</em><br>
<p>Go for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  I'm interested in the transcripts for what they say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about human psychology.
</em><br>
<p>Ditto, but my satisfying my curiosity is a minor consideration
<br>
compared to convincing people that AI-boxing is an incredibly
<br>
risky (i.e. probably futile, but a small risk of blowing up the
<br>
world is still an insane risk under most conditions) strategy.
