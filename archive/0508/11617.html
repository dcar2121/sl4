You're still missing my point, Ben. You wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think there is a reasonably good analogy with a dog who has cornered his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human victim and thinks there's no way the human can escape -- until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human is rescued by a helicopter, something the dog has never seen or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagined, and which lies outside the world-model of the dog. 
</em><br>
<p>The problem with this is that it's uncontroversial that if there is a
<br>
helicopter, then dog won't account for it and will be surprised if the human
<br>
gets away. However, this puts a damper on the dog's strategy only if there is a
<br>
helicopter. If there is no helicopter, then the fact that the dog didn't
<br>
account for it doesn't make a difference.
<br>
<p>You reason as though you had reason to believe that there was a
<br>
helicopter/exploit, and not just that helicopter/exploits are logically
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This doesn't mean that plausible, rational arguments can't be made (even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they fall short of full scientific rigor), of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the only arguments I know how to make to bolster my intuition that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; box-exploits are reasonably likely, are complex arguments that depend on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detailed arguments about specific places where I think modern physics may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomplete. This is a topic better reviewed in a long technical paper than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a casual email...
</em><br>
<p>Okay, well if you can't give me a precise answer, can you at least let me in on
<br>
the structure of your argument? I say this because I'm not sure rational
<br>
arguments can be made (for your position). Consider the structure of your
<br>
conclution: &quot;I think I have good reason to believe proposition X about an area
<br>
of knowledge that I will never know anything about.&quot; That seems paradoxical.
<br>
<p>Now, you mention *specific* places where you think that physics is incomplete.
<br>
I'm not sure what those areas are, but I assume they must be relatively small
<br>
sized portions of the domain of possible physics. In making claim (3) from my
<br>
previous email, you could have been saying that there is a box-exploit in
<br>
*some* area of physics, or in *this* area of physics, &quot;this&quot; being a pretty
<br>
specialized area.
<br>
<p>I think the &quot;some&quot; argument is pretty hopeless. The &quot;this&quot; argument is somewhat
<br>
better, but I have difficulty understanding two problems:
<br>
<p>a) How it has anything to do with the &quot;some&quot; argument, which seemed to be the
<br>
point of the original &quot;magic&quot; problem.
<br>
<p>b) How it squares with this claim you made:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I may have mentioned &quot;quantum teleportation&quot; as one particular possibility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but if this possibility is proved impossible, that doesn't affect my point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.
</em><br>
<p>It seems like the &quot;this&quot; argument just means bringing up a few more
<br>
possibilities. I know that you have a finite knowledge of physics, so you could
<br>
only have so many possibilities that you could be justified in suspecting had
<br>
an exploit. If all of those possibilities were known to not have exploits (or,
<br>
assume for the sake of argument that those possibilities do not have exploits):
<br>
would you still assert that magic is an issue worth worrying about? It seems
<br>
like you would. If so, then you still have to answer my arguments about why I
<br>
don't think it's rational to believe in &quot;magic,&quot; and you can't use any of your
<br>
suppositions about incomplete theories of physics.
<br>
