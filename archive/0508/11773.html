<p>I disagree Ben.  I think Godel is the key to this
<br>
whole thing!  As you know, I'm desperate to try to
<br>
prove Universal Morality and I've been lunging and
<br>
stabbing wildly at anything that might save the day
<br>
for altruism.  Godel is my last straw! ;)
<br>
<p>For how can an AI self-improve unless it can
<br>
*understand it's own system* ?  You yourself have been
<br>
thinking about this problem (recall your ITSSIM).  A
<br>
self-improving AI, it seems to me, has to maintain
<br>
temporal continuity with past versions of itself - how
<br>
can it be sure that the future version of itself is an
<br>
improvement on its current version?  It seems to me
<br>
that the only way it can do this is by somehow
<br>
*understanding it's own system*.
<br>
<p>An AI which did not understand it's own system could
<br>
not be sure that any modification it made to itself
<br>
would be an improvement.  Lack of understanding in
<br>
recursive self-modification would probably quickly
<br>
destroy the system altogther, since it would make a
<br>
fatal blunder.
<br>
<p>My idea for 'Godel to save the day for friendliness',
<br>
is simply that the unfriendly ai's can't understand
<br>
their own systems properly and hence they can't
<br>
self-improve.
<br>
<p>Now, I'm sure a paperclip maximizer could have
<br>
*complete awareness* of its own system.  BUT COMPLETE
<br>
AWARENESS IS *NOT* THE SAME THING AS COMPLETE
<br>
UNDERSTANDING!  It is not just complete AWARENESS of
<br>
one's own system that is needed for self-improvement,
<br>
it is complete UNDERSTANDING.
<br>
<p>Perhaps only a friendly AI could have complete
<br>
understanding of its own system?
