<em>&gt;Subject: Emotional intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Tue, 23 Aug 2005 02:00:47 +0100
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I mentioned in my JOIN that I'm working on a model of intelligence using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotion as the driving force.  When I posted that message to SIAI, I got 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some questions back about it, so I'll post my reply here as well.  I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;writing up another email clarifying some things and explaining some more of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the complexity involved, but for the sake of netiquette I'll just send this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out for the moment and save the extra stuff for when I (hopefully) get some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions back.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The fundamental driving force behind emotional intelligence (as I see it) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a desire to be happy.  &quot;Happiness&quot; in the case of AI is just a number, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as are all emotions.  In a biological intelligence there is some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correlation for emotions as simple vectors - it might, for example, be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasonable to measure the fear level of a creature based upon the amount of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adrenaline in its system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The catch is, the system cannot make itself happy.  All of the input it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given affects its emotional state - if it observes people who are happy, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becomes happy itself.  In essence, it is driven by a desire to make other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people happy - or, to put that another way, it is driven by &quot;friendliness&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>You are getting fuzzy here. Yes, I can follow that the observation of 
<br>
happiness may very well lead to happiness, but this is not true in all 
<br>
cases. Especially as a fundamental drive for &quot;friendliness&quot;.
<br>
<p>The actual value of the emotion is ultimately derived from the part of the 
<br>
brain which decides what observations are intrinsically valueable, thus the 
<br>
happiness you have observing someone else being happy is actually a heavily 
<br>
dependent emotion. Careful there.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alongside basic happiness sit a number of other basic emotions - fear, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anger, etc etc.  Again, each of these cannot be influenced directly by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being itself (at least not by conscious thought), they are primarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;controlled by external influences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Above these primal emotions sit more complex emotions, such as confidence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stubbornness, and optimism.  (There is a threshold at which  these should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be regarded as personality traits, although that's not strictly relevant).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Each of these more complex emotions has a smaller influence on overall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happiness, but at the same time are influenced less by external factors.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As a general rule, every emotion is controlled by two things - external 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influences, and other emotions.  Any emotion which has a large effect on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overall happiness is controlled more readily by external influences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Example: Optimism is strongly affected by external influences.  Optimism  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;controls how likely you are to take a chance - if the chance pays off, your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimism goes up, and you feel happier because of it.  At the same time, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stubbornness affects optimism, but does not directly affect happiness much. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you are stubborn in a given situation, you are less likely to take a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chance, and the happiness increase when that chance succeeds is far less.
</em><br>
<p><p>Sounds like you've got some pretty well founded observations here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Memory is a combination of two things.  Firstly, a word - the concept in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question.  Secondly, attached to each word is a set of emotional vectors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which comprise the beings total experience about that object or concept.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the being encounters an object that it recognises, it consults its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memory to see how that object has made it feel in the past, determines 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether the emotions it presents are appropriate for its current mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state, and either promotes or avoids the encounter accordingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Example:  Let's say that in the past, you have been bitten by a dog. Pain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a universal way to reduce happiness (much like pleasure is a universal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way to increase it), so the emotional vectors associated with your memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a dog include negative happiness.  However, if you see a person holding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a dog and you remember that the person has, in the past, made you very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happy, you may still decide that the dog is not worth avoiding; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negative happiness based upon your experiences with dogs are offset by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;positive happiness of your experiences with the person, and you can make an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent decision on how to respond to the situation.
</em><br>
<p><p>Again, I'm definitely following you here.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Automated learning, in any given situation, is simply the product of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combining a number of different emotional memories together in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieve the required goal.  You program the system with a number of basic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;operations that could be applied to the task, and let the system experiment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;randomly, learning based upon emotion along the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If, for example, correctly recognising a face stimulates &quot;pleasure&quot; (either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by seeing that the face is smiling, or by the programmer pressing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;pleasure&quot; button), then whatever operations were used to perform that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recognition (adjust brightness, decrease color depth, adjust contrast, etc 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc) are then given higher happiness ratings, and are more likely to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used again.  The act of randomly combining operations together is based 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upon emotion, and the success or failure of each attempt is similarly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stored as emotion.  If, for example, the computer takes a chance on a new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;graphics operation when attempting the recognition, it will remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether it tried it before and failed based upon the stored value for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confidence; if its confidence is high at that time then it may still take a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chance on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Yep looks good, although
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's a lot more complexity than what I've presented here,
</em><br>
<p><p>You are missing a key concept, at least from the perspective of my 
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;If, for example, correctly recognising a face stimulates &quot;pleasure&quot; , then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whatever operations were used to perform that recognition (adjust 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brightness, decrease color depth, adjust contrast, etc etc) are then given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher happiness ratings, and are more likely to be used again.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think that's where you need to expand a little bit. This is where I would 
<br>
mark as &quot;missing some complexity&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;but I think this should convey the gist of what I'm thinking.  Hopefully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's enough to let people start exploring the idea themselves, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hopefully I can answer some of your questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
