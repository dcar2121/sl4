Hi all,
<br>
<p>I've been pointed here by a couple of folks over at SIAI, since I have 
<br>
some ideas about AGI - somewhat controversial ones by all counts.  So, 
<br>
by way of a join post, I'll copy and paste the relevant bits from the SI 
<br>
list...
<br>
<p><p>A quick disclaimer:  Today was the first time I even heard the phrase 
<br>
&quot;technological singularity&quot;, although I've been exploring the idea for 
<br>
some time now.  I'm definitely not &quot;up&quot; on the terminology, so apologies 
<br>
in advance for any misnomers :)
<br>
<p>Not-quite-first, an introduction.  My name is Chris Paget, I'm a 
<br>
27-year-old security consultant who lives and works in London.  I'm 
<br>
married (for almost a year now) to an american, Erin, and we're in the 
<br>
process of applying for a spousal visa so we can move back to 
<br>
Pennsylvania (where Erin is from).  I've been programming since I was 3 
<br>
years old, and a penetration tester for about 4 years now, the last 3 of 
<br>
which have been with NGS Software; if you're into security you will have 
<br>
probably heard of me from security.tombom.co.uk/shatter.html, which I 
<br>
published in August 2002.  I'll mention that I studied Computer Science 
<br>
at Cambridge Uni (here in the UK) but if you want the rest of my 
<br>
(probably rather boring) history feel free to ask me :)
<br>
<p>Now to the interesting stuff.  The idea that I have been working on 
<br>
apparently fits into the Wikipedia definition of &quot;strong&quot; AI - I know 
<br>
very little about neural nets, genetic algorithms and their ilk, and 
<br>
don't really want to know - it seems like a blind alley to me.  Too much 
<br>
research time is, IMHO, currently spent on AI as a system of complexity; 
<br>
it seems like the current thinking is that if you add sufficient 
<br>
complexity to a system it can &quot;appear&quot; intelligent, maybe even enough to 
<br>
pass a turing test.  I believe this is wrong; my ideas are focussed 
<br>
around intelligence as an emergent system based on some relatively 
<br>
simple rules.
<br>
<p>The stuff I've had time to read on the SIAI website appears to be fairly 
<br>
high-level; they've certainly solved some interesting problems before 
<br>
they've even arisen, using some clever reasoning.  However, I disagree 
<br>
with the statement that &quot;...the search for a single essence of 
<br>
intelligence lies at the center of AI's previous failures&quot;.  I believe 
<br>
the problem is quite the opposite; we have not yet looked hard enough at 
<br>
the overall problem to realise that the most complex problem (as we see 
<br>
it) is actually the simplest - that of how to integrate emotion into an 
<br>
artificial mind.
<br>
<p>My thinkings have largely focussed upon this problem, with some 
<br>
startling conclusions.  I believe that emotion is a fundamental 
<br>
component of intelligence, that the two are inextricably linked, and 
<br>
that it may even be the case that they cannot exist without each other. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't go into too much detail (just in case I'm emailing a black 
<br>
hole here), but I believe that a simple system, constructed around some 
<br>
very basic principles (I refer to it as emotional mechanics) can be 
<br>
emergent, and that the emerging properties and behaviours are what we 
<br>
would classify as intelligence.
<br>
<p>I'm looking at the problem from a much lower level than what I've read 
<br>
on the SIAI site; they've solved a lot of the high-level problems I've 
<br>
thought of (and many that I hadn't), but I'm more interested in the guts 
<br>
of the system - actually translating it into code that can be written. 
<br>
I'm on the verge of a simple implementation, essentially integrating 
<br>
emotions into an intelligent tic-tac-toe system.  I haven't gotten 
<br>
further than the planning yet, but it's already proving an interesting 
<br>
exercise.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I think I've rambled enough for what was intended to be a brief 
<br>
introduction, so I'll stop here.  Please feel free to ask for more 
<br>
detail on anything I've mentioned in this mail; I'm happy to discuss 
<br>
anything.  Be warned though, if you do wish to ask about my visa 
<br>
application the response you get may be somewhat tedious and boring - US 
<br>
visas are not fun to apply for :(
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>Chris
