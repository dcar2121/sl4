<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p>I have to restrict my response to only one point you made, because some 
<br>
of the places you quoted me were situations where I was trying to 
<br>
characterize and clarify a position that I was *opposing*, so my head is 
<br>
now spinning trying to keep track of whether I am coming or going :-).
<br>
<p>Anyow, this is an important issue:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;wait!  why would it be so impoverished in its understanding of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;motivation systems, that it just &quot;believes its goal to do [x]&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;confuses this with the last word on what pushes its buttons?  Would it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not have a much deeper understanding, and say &quot;I feel this urge to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;paperclipize, but I know it's just a quirk of my motivation system, so, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;let's see, is this sensible?  Do I have any other choices here?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, you're still anthropomorphising. A paperclip maximiser would not see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its goals as a 'quirk'. Everything it does is aimed at the goal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximising paperclips. It is not an 'urge', it is the prime cause for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every action and every inference the AI undertakes. 'Sensible' is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a meaningful concept either; maximising paperclips is 'sensible' by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition, and human concepts of sensibility are irrelevant when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't affect paperclip yield. There would be no reason (by which I mean,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no valid causal chain that could occur within the AI) to ever choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions, including altering the goal system, that would fail to maximise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expected number of future paperclips.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is how expected utility works, and it can be quite chilling. Car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies failing to recall unsafe cars if the cost of the lawsuits is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller than the cost of the recall is a tiny foretaste of the morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indifferent efficiency that EU driven AGIs can deliver.
</em><br>
<p>This hypothetical paperclip maximiser is both having its cake and eating it.
<br>
<p>If a paperclip maximiser is not aware of such things as goals and 
<br>
motivations, it is not smart enough to be relevant, for the following 
<br>
sequence of reasons:
<br>
<p>a) The Seed AI is going to be expected to know enough to bootstrap 
<br>
itself up to higher levels of intelligence.  If all it knows is 
<br>
paperclip maximiziation, it will be too stupid to do that.
<br>
<p>b) A dangerously unstoppable paperclip maximizer will have to be built 
<br>
by an AI:  we are not smart enough, without help, to develop a runaway 
<br>
paperclip maximiser that will escape detection by other humans on the 
<br>
lookout for rogue AI projects.  This is pre-Singularity stuff.
<br>
<p>c) A successful Seed AI will bootstrap and then eliminate rival projects 
<br>
quickly (except for case (d) below).  After that, it will not allow 
<br>
experiments such as the construction of superintelligent paperclip 
<br>
maximisers.
<br>
<p>d) If the Seed AI does not make the choice to be Friendly (on the side 
<br>
of &quot;convergence&quot; (see parallel post in reply to Ben)), then it will 
<br>
allow rival projects, etc. etc.  It All Ends In Tears.  For reasons 
<br>
discussed elsewhere, I think this extremely unlikely.  This is the only 
<br>
case that could generate a paperclip maximiser that did not have general 
<br>
intelligence and awareness of such issues as motivation.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>So, again:  I am not anthropomorphising (accidentally attributing 
<br>
human-like qualities where they don't belong), but making the specific 
<br>
statement that a seed AI worth worrying about would be impossibly 
<br>
crippled if it did not have awareness of such design issues.
<br>
<p>I am making this, not on general philosophical grounds, but on the basis 
<br>
of specific nuts-and-bolts issues about how to get a real cognitive 
<br>
system working.
<br>
<p>And here, the nuts-and-bilts issue I have been raising is:  &quot;What is the 
<br>
role of a motivation mechanism in a cognitive system, and how will that 
<br>
impact the design and behavior of the Seed AI?&quot;
