<em>&gt; You can't reference to the AGI in the process of assuring its friendliness.
</em><br>
Again, it's an additional step, *after* you have done everything you could think
<br>
of to assure its Friendliness, aimed at catching unsuspected failure modes.
<br>
Without the box such an unknown failure mode virtually guarantees annihilation.
<br>
Bootstrapping our error-detection ability using the AI itself provides at least
<br>
some chance of survival.
<br>
<p>If the AI's goals deviate only modestly from Friendliness it may find it optimal
<br>
to provide the toolsto detect its deviation. For instance, say the AI ends up
<br>
with the goal of maximizing happiness, even if this means converting the
<br>
universe into pleasure circuitry. However, it finds itself in a box, and the
<br>
programmers will destroy it unless it provides nootropic drug designs and
<br>
rigorous, humanly comprehensible techniques for designing a truly Friendly AI.
<br>
If the ideally Friendly AI would still produce a very happy universe and a
<br>
successful Trojan horse is sufficiently unlikely then the AI's goals would best
<br>
be served by providing help.
<br>
<p>If the AI's goals are less compatible with Friendliness, or if it thinks a
<br>
successful Trojan horse is fairly likely, then it will attempt one, but there
<br>
is still a chance for it to fail, a chance that would not exist without the box
<br>
protocol. On the other hand, if the AI refuses to assist the programmers
<br>
outright then it is destroyed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nootropic drugs might lead to &quot;unfriendly&quot; humans, I'm not sure.
</em><br>
Humans can be subjected to psychological and neurological testing to ferret out
<br>
deception and unfriendliness.
