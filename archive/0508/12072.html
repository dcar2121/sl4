<p>
I was just discussing DARPA and AI with Peter Voss at dinner Friday 
<br>
night, and we both agreed there was very little AGI in sight.
<br>
<p>Today I saw these interesting developments at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/open/05-18_PIP.htm">http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/open/05-18_PIP.htm</a>.
<br>
<p>*1 Program Objective *
<br>
<p>The goal of the Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures Program 
<br>
via this BAA is to develop, implement and evaluate psychologically-based 
<br>
and neurobiologically-based theories, design principles, and 
<br>
architectures of human cognition. In a subsequent phase, the program has 
<br>
the ultimate goal of implementing computational models of human 
<br>
cognition that could eventually be used to simulate human behavior and 
<br>
approach human cognitive performance in a wide range of situations.
<br>
<p>*2 Background and Motivation*
<br>
<p>The traditional approach to machine intelligence pursued by the 
<br>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) community has provided many achievements, 
<br>
but has fallen short of the grand vision of integrated, versatile, 
<br>
intelligent systems. Revolutionary advances may be possible by building 
<br>
upon new approaches inspired by cognitive psychology and neuroscience. 
<br>
Such approaches have the potential to help us understand and model 
<br>
significant aspects of intelligence thus far not attained by classic 
<br>
formal knowledge modeling technology. This program seeks to advance the 
<br>
design and development of computational models of human cognition based 
<br>
on architectures using both approaches.
<br>
<p>During the past 15 years, intensive research in neuroscience, enabled by 
<br>
advances in experimental techniques and instrumentation, has led to 
<br>
substantial progress in our understanding of the brain's physical 
<br>
structure and function. It is now feasible to develop cognitive 
<br>
architectures, rooted in neuroscience, which may offer important insight 
<br>
into the understanding and modeling of human cognition.
