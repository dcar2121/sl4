I had not heard of this before. If we accept the paraphrase advanced on this 
<br>
page - &quot;if some experimenters are able to behave in a way that is not 
<br>
completely predetermined, then the behavior of elementary particles is also 
<br>
not a function of their prior history&quot; - then the &quot;theorem&quot; gives 
<br>
determinists absolutely no new reasons to believe in free will, as it boils 
<br>
down to this: &quot;if some events have no causes, then certain other events also 
<br>
have no cause&quot;. But why would you believe of any event that it has no cause?
<br>
<p>Conway's only reported argument in support of free will comes after the 
<br>
lecture: &quot;Holding up a piece of chalk, he said he felt he could choose 
<br>
whether or not he would drop it or continue to hold it.&quot; So, the fate of the 
<br>
chalk is determined by Conway's choice; but is Conway's choice not in turn 
<br>
determined by something else, whether it be psychological or physiological, 
<br>
conscious or unconscious, an aspect of himself or something external to him? 
<br>
Apparently he really wants to assert the existence of something called 
<br>
&quot;whim&quot;, a type of event in the mind which has no cause at all - it just 
<br>
happens. Well, he is free to postulate such a thing, but I would like to 
<br>
know what sort of phenomenological *evidence* he might have for it. Even if 
<br>
there is a faculty of knowledge allowing a person to say whether they are 
<br>
causally involved with a perceived event, that tells you nothing about the 
<br>
causes (or lack thereof) of events for which you think you are *not* 
<br>
responsible.
<br>
<p>Celia Green's &quot;The Lost Cause&quot; looks to be a good book about mind, matter, 
<br>
and causality.
