<p><em>&gt; I have to point out that you are looking at

</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to the original point.
</em><br>
<p>The field of &quot;complex systems&quot; studies systems that are,
<br>
typically, extremely simple, in that they can be described
<br>
in a few sentences.  Sandpiles, the game of Life, etc.
<br>
What makes the outcome complex is not the complexity of
<br>
the parts or the rules, but the multiplicity of non-linear
<br>
interactions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This means:  it builds a representation of what is going on inside 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.  And as part of its &quot;thinking&quot; it may be curious about what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens if it reaches into its own programming and makes alterations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its goal system on the fly.  (Is there anything in your formalism
</em><br>
that 
<br>
<em>&gt; says it cannot or would not do this?  Is it not free, within the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints of the goal system, to engage in speculation about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities?  To be a good learner, it would surely imagine such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventualities.)
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes we design systems to have this capability.
<br>
It's a difficult design problem; you have to go out of your way to
<br>
design a computer program that has access to its own programming.
<br>
This is rarely done completely, except in Prolog programs.
<br>
LISP programs often have this property to some extent, but
<br>
there is always an outer main loop that the program doesn't
<br>
have access to.  Unless you go to extremes (which some people
<br>
have done) to create a program that can replicate its own
<br>
source code.  Those things are freaks of nature, and you
<br>
absolutely wouldn't take a big complicated program and
<br>
re-design it to have that property.
<br>
<p>Note that on modern CPUs, with code generated by compilers,
<br>
a program-instruction (code) block typically cannot execute
<br>
instructions to read data values from its own block, or from
<br>
another code block.  Data is in data blocks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It also models the implications of making such changes.  Let us
</em><br>
suppose, 
<br>
<em>&gt; *just for the sake of argument*, that it notices that some of its
</em><br>
goals 
<br>
<em>&gt; have subtle implications for the state of the world in the future
</em><br>
[ snip ]
<br>
<p>I understand what you're saying.  I disagree.
<br>
Somewhere in the agent, there is a piece of &quot;code&quot;, whether it's
<br>
implemented as a neural network, or as a series of x86 instructions,
<br>
or whatever, that controls a choice mechanism that ranks or
<br>
otherwise selects actions, goals, and so on.  Even while the program
<br>
is examining that very code, and deciding what to do about it,
<br>
it is doing so under the control of that code.
<br>
<p>Supposing that the AI designer had gone to the extra effort to
<br>
allow the program to read and modify that particular piece of
<br>
code, the AI might choose to modify that code.  But that choice
<br>
itself would still be controlled by that code.
<br>
<p>The AI can't make a choice that isn't controlled by its
<br>
pre-existing choice mechanism, which is governed by a set
<br>
of wired-in preferences or values or goals or whatever you
<br>
choose to call them.  It will act in a way meant to satisfy
<br>
those preferences.  It may act in error, accidentally
<br>
redirecting its goal system.  It might also be that the
<br>
motivational system has been programmed in a buggy way that
<br>
leads to conclusions the designers didn't intend, in the same
<br>
way that, for example, deep study of Buddhist doctrine could
<br>
lead you to conclude that destroying the Universe would be a
<br>
virtuous act, yet Buddha himself would not have approved
<br>
of that conclusion.
<br>
<p>Digression:  Buddhism operates under an exemplar-based rather
<br>
than a logic-based system.  A disciple is not meant to deduce
<br>
all the rules and compute their logical closure; a disciple is
<br>
meant, rather, to study a large set of cases, and apply them
<br>
to other situations, using similarity judgements rather than logic.
<br>
This might be a safer way to design AI motivational systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, demonstrate in some formal way that the goal system's structure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the AGI has finished this little thought episode, is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictable consequence of the current goal system.
</em><br>
<p>Hard to know what you mean by &quot;predictable&quot;.  You can't mean
<br>
&quot;predictable&quot; in the ordinary sense, since no one here would argue
<br>
that the goal system's structure is predictable.  Hopefully
<br>
you don't mean &quot;deterministic&quot;, e.g., that a sufficiently
<br>
complex deterministic system is no longer deterministic.
<br>
But I can't figure out what else you might be trying to say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Demonstrate that the goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system cannot go into an arbitrary state in a few minutes.
</em><br>
<p>Likewise, if &quot;arbitrary&quot; mean &quot;unpredictable&quot;, or if it means
<br>
&quot;nondeterministic&quot;, then this statement is unhelpful.  But I
<br>
don't know what else it could mean.
