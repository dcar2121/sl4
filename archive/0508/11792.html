<p>&lt;snicker-snack explanation of proposed self-selecting communities of experts/&gt;

<p><em>&gt; Meanhile, I don't want to debate the above in this forum.  You can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate issues that touch people's core paradigmatic commitments.  Read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuhn or Feyerabend to understand why.
</em><br>
<p>You know, maybe I'm just too thick to be insulted, but.. what was the
<br>
relevance of that? Were you saying that all the people responding to
<br>
your emails belonged to one of your invented communities?
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, most of the people on this list are not deep experts. I
<br>
have always hoped that sl4 or extropians would produce a pool of
<br>
deeply competent people in clearly defined areas of expertise I could
<br>
call upon. But most of the active participants here are either
<br>
generalists, or reaching somewhat beyond their specialities when
<br>
talking here. Most sl4-ers do not work for ultratechnology companies.
<br>
<p>Most of us got here *through* generalism. This is not a new concept.
<br>
There are, insofar as I am aware, very few people here who think that
<br>
something like SOAR is ever going to work. I only know of one person
<br>
who thinks highly of Cyc, and he works/worked there. Many of us have
<br>
our own painfully gathered databases of knowledges we believe are
<br>
relevant. There are software engineers and artists on this list, and I
<br>
can't think of any active posters who display the characteristics you
<br>
were describing.
<br>
<p>Did you have specific behaviors you wanted to react to? Those probably
<br>
are better addressed on a case-by-case basis. I just got the feeling
<br>
that this 'Retrenchment' may have had something to do with me, or was
<br>
in response to one of the discussions you had which I took part in, 
<br>
but I just couldn't figure out how.
