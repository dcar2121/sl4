Hmm.  It seems that shall have to post again to

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the day of your departure [sic], may I step in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with my first post and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give what I believe to be a cogent response to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) You would like morality (and cognition and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volition, etc.) to be as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tight a system of ideas as physics - where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts and laws and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equations fit together with such elegant mutual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistency that we can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say with some confidence that *this* (physics) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *the* correct account 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of how the universe is (modulo some fine details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we are still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on).  You would like there to be an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension of physics to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover morality, cognition, volition, etc., and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension to inherit the universality that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe we can see in physics.
</em><br>
<p>This is not really correct.  You have misinterpreted
<br>
me.  I'm not proposing much of an extension to
<br>
*physics* as such, rather an extension to *science*.
<br>
<p>I am a property dualist, in that I think that at the
<br>
most fundamental level of reality, there's more than
<br>
one valid way to describe that reality.
<br>
<p>Materialism is *one* valid way to describe reality
<br>
(that is, I agree that everything can be *described*
<br>
in physical terms).
<br>
<p>But I'm proposing that materialism is not the *only*
<br>
valid way to describe reality.  I think one could for
<br>
instance, equally give a full description of all of
<br>
reality in terms of qualia (mental events).  
<br>
<p>So materialism gives a complete *description* of
<br>
reality, but not a complete *explanation* of reality. 
<br>
Materialism has *descriptive* completeness, but not
<br>
*explanatory* completeness.  I think things like
<br>
volition, qualia etc are fundamental properties of the
<br>
universe.  So I think new kinds of science are needed
<br>
to *explain* these things in their own terms.  
<br>
<p>Do you follow?  If not look up 'property dualism' in a
<br>
philosophy dictionary.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) You go beyond just wanting this, of course:  you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say you know it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true and claim to be able to &quot;prove&quot; it.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, well again, I think you've misinterpreted.  I
<br>
certainly don't claim to have proved it!  (If I was
<br>
THAT good I wouldn't be wasting time here, I'd be out
<br>
coding the AGI and submitting papers to all the
<br>
science journals)
<br>
<p>I think my *general principles* seem to me to have an
<br>
irreducible force of intuitive 'rightness' to them ;)
<br>
<p>Of course, general principles is one thing, working
<br>
out the math is quite another...
<br>
<p>I haven't got the math.  That would probably take me
<br>
15-35 years I estimate.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am a cognitive scientist (and, coincidentally, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former student of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Taylor).  This theory is *not* widely accepted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Au contraire, your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion of &quot;consciousness&quot; (like Taylor's) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; riddled with the kind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of confusion that sends philosophers and cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists tearing up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wall with frustration.
</em><br>
<p>What 'wild assertions'?  What 'confusion'?  I'd say
<br>
the ideas are crystal clear, albeit highly
<br>
speculative.
<br>
<p>'property dualism' is a crystal clear philosophical
<br>
position.  As an assertion it says that qualia are a
<br>
fundamental property of the universe (See what I said
<br>
above).
<br>
<p>It's most of the current scientific community that are
<br>
confused about qualia, not me ;)
<br>
<p>Let me put it this way:  Suppose you tried to claim
<br>
that consciousness can be completely explained in
<br>
material terms.  Then I would ask:   If everyone was a
<br>
zombie would they be able to understand your
<br>
explanation? ;)  This to me is the clearest argument
<br>
you can get that materialism might have *descriptive*
<br>
completeness, but it doesn't have *explanatory*
<br>
completeness, and any explanation of qualia actually
<br>
*presupposes* the existence of qualia to begin with.
<br>
<p>Let me sum up my theory again, in crystal clear terms:
<br>
<p>*Reality itself is operating off 7 different
<br>
mathematical systems of axioms.
<br>
<p>*Each of these 7 axiom sets are *almost* but not quite
<br>
consistent.  So I'm saying there are small
<br>
inconsistencies in reality iteself.
<br>
<p>*The maths from each of the different axiom sets can
<br>
serve as a 'metalanguage' to understand the maths of
<br>
the other axiom sets.  So 'reality' forms a complete
<br>
'closed loop'.  But you need at least 7 different
<br>
axiom sets to get a 'complete' system.  This is the
<br>
only way to beat the 'Godel limitation'. 
<br>
<p>*Each mathematical axiom set appears to us as 'a
<br>
fundamental proeprty' of reality.  One type of math
<br>
appears as 'Cognition', another type of math appears
<br>
as 'Computation', another type appears as 'Volition',
<br>
another type as 'Force' (or interaction), another type
<br>
as 'Qualia', another type as 'Propositions' and the
<br>
final type as 'Space/Matter' (geometey).  So there are
<br>
7 different ways to interpret reality depending on
<br>
which axiom set we choose to describe reality as.
<br>
<p>*Any working general intelligence would have to mimic
<br>
the structure of reality itself.  So you would need 7 
<br>
different axiom sets to beat the Godel problem.  And
<br>
to get seed FAI you simply have to put enough
<br>
information in, so phrased in the language of one type
<br>
of math, the system can completely  understand the
<br>
other types of math (i.e cognitive closure).
<br>
<p>I'd say these ideas are crystal clear.  To me at least
<br>
they seem blindingly, overwhelmingly obvious.  No, I
<br>
don't claim to have proved them yet, but I'm certainly
<br>
puzzled as to why for instance, someone like Eliezer
<br>
can't see how clear-cut and right they actually are ;)
<br>

As to Ben's point, please re-read my previous posts
Ben!  There's more than one kind of 'pattern'.  I just
told you I think there are in fact 7 different
fundamental mathematical definitions.  I think
'volition' is a fundamental property of the universe,
so there'll be a specific mathematical definition of
pattern concerned with that.  And then I pointed out
that the AI reasons:
&quot;property X is good for cognition if property X is
needed for cognition&quot;
Since Volition is a fundamental property of the
universe needed for 'cognitive closure', the AI must
automatically conclude volition is good, and altruism
automatically follows.
