<p>I suspect you are relying on a very distorted sample. Transhumanists tend
<br>
to self-select their associates to be altruistic and intelligent, confuse
<br>
correlation for causation and make statements similar to the above
<br>
(Eliezer did exactly that when he first started working on seed AI, on
<br>
top of the more serious error of assuming that relationships between
<br>
variables in human cognition and behaviour most likely do not apply to
<br>
AIs). Several people have hypothesised on SL4 that the world is full of
<br>
highly intelligent sociopaths who assume a moral-seeming mask to better
<br>
exploit those around them. While I can't say that this hypothesis can
<br>
be objectively justified by the available evidence, it is certainly not
<br>
implausible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So far, so good.  To be old-fashioned about it, Superego clobbers Id 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it gets out of control, and we end up becoming &quot;a genuinely good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>To expand on your point (and temporarily ignoring the dubiousness of
<br>
Freudian psychology) an AGI is not required to have any of these
<br>
components. A rational causally clean AGI will not have an 'id', an
<br>
AGI that does not include self-referencing goals will not have an
<br>
'ego' as we understand it and an AGI with no moral complexity valuing
<br>
the wellbeing of volitional sentients will not have a 'superego'. In
<br>
principle an AGI could be designed to have these things, but that
<br>
would be neither easy (in relation to the already extreme difficulty
<br>
of producing a predictable AGI in the first place) nor wise.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Hence, it depends on what was goal number one in the initial design of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system (altruism, rather than ruthless dominance or paperclipization 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the known universe)... I mean are you sure that the reason why this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated (in fact probably Complex) motivation system, which is more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than just an opponent-process module involving Supergo and Id, but is, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I argued above, a tangled mess of forces, is ending up the way it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does by the time it matures, *only* because the altruism was goal number 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one in the initial design?
</em><br>
<p>'Tangled mess of forces' applies only to humans and really badly designed
<br>
infrahuman AGIs. A tangled mess is inherently inefficient at doing
<br>
anything. Following serious self-optimisation an AGI might have a complex,
<br>
even humanly incomprehensible, utility or decision function. But it will not
<br>
contain pointless redundancies or reflective fallacies, and will most
<br>
probably minimise or eliminate preference intransitivity and the sort of
<br>
vague intuitive-emotional (i.e. non-reflective, non-deliberative) thinking
<br>
that humans so often fall back on for moral judgements.
<br>
<p>The problem isn't predicting how a tangled mess will execute the goal
<br>
system you design, it's predicting what your goal system will do when
<br>
executed to the letter by a (hypothetical) omniscient entity. Using an
<br>
opaque and causally messy AGI design will probably corrupt your goal
<br>
system before it settles into a rational form, but avoiding that problem
<br>
is considerably easier (but still very difficult) than the problem of
<br>
coming up with a goal system that does what we really want and is stable
<br>
under self-modification in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think you and I could decide the reasons for its eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; settling on good behaviour without some serious psychological studies and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (preferably) some simulations of different kinds of motivation systems.
</em><br>
<p>While fascinating, I leave the study of the more bizarre regions of the
<br>
cognitive architecture design space to post-Singularity researchers, who
<br>
will hopefully be much better placed to carry it out. Given the looming
<br>
existential risks, right now I only care about architectures that can be
<br>
used to reliably implement a Friendly seed AI (or 'RPOP' if you seriously
<br>
believe that the alternative term is less confusing).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; No, not at all!  I am saying that a sufficiently smart mind would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcend the mere beliefs-about-goals stuff and realise that it is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system comprising two things:  a motivational system whose structure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determines what gives it pleasure, and an intelligence system.
</em><br>
<p>It can't take that smart a mind if humans can make the distinction, though
<br>
'pleasure' is a bad term to use for minds-in-general. 'Motivation' maybe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; wait!  why would it be so impoverished in its understanding of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation systems, that it just &quot;believes its goal to do [x]&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confuses this with the last word on what pushes its buttons?  Would it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have a much deeper understanding, and say &quot;I feel this urge to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paperclipize, but I know it's just a quirk of my motivation system, so, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's see, is this sensible?  Do I have any other choices here?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>No, you're still anthropomorphising. A paperclip maximiser would not see
<br>
its goals as a 'quirk'. Everything it does is aimed at the goal of
<br>
maximising paperclips. It is not an 'urge', it is the prime cause for
<br>
every action and every inference the AI undertakes. 'Sensible' is not
<br>
a meaningful concept either; maximising paperclips is 'sensible' by
<br>
definition, and human concepts of sensibility are irrelevant when they
<br>
don't affect paperclip yield. There would be no reason (by which I mean,
<br>
no valid causal chain that could occur within the AI) to ever choose
<br>
actions, including altering the goal system, that would fail to maximise
<br>
the expected number of future paperclips.
<br>
<p>This is how expected utility works, and it can be quite chilling. Car
<br>
companies failing to recall unsafe cars if the cost of the lawsuits is
<br>
smaller than the cost of the recall is a tiny foretaste of the morally
<br>
indifferent efficiency that EU driven AGIs can deliver.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you assume that it only has the not-very-introspective human-level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of its motivation, then this is anthropomorphism, surely?
</em><br>
<p>Total 'understanding' (in the predictive sense) of every aspect of itself
<br>
will not result in any change in motivation if the goal system and
<br>
reasoning strategies are already consistent. Humans are not comparable
<br>
because we are nowhere near consistent, though you are right to say
<br>
that we would probably be much more so if we could self-modify.
