<p>Friendly AI is a term of art that applies to AIs only.  There is no such thing 
<br>
as a Friendly human.
<br>
<p>Expected utility maximization can tell you the correct action to take relative 
<br>
to a utility function.  Whether expected utility maximization is 'rational' is 
<br>
a less open-and-shut question than whether Bayesian probability theory is 
<br>
rational.
<br>
<p>Occasionally people who know very little about real-world cults start going on 
<br>
about whether the Singularity / SIAI / SL4 / etc. is a cult.  The cure I would 
<br>
prescribe to them is to spend three days with the Raelians.  But there's also 
<br>
the question of how it is that SL4 *avoids* becoming a cult, which, contrary 
<br>
to what people think, takes an effort.  Cultishness is a natural human impulse 
<br>
and a natural condition into which groups slide - a high-entropy state, as 
<br>
'twere, requiring a continual expenditure of work to keep out of.
<br>
<p>Part of that is that you keep your special expertise special.  I don't tell 
<br>
people what to eat, who to sleep with, how to dress, how to cook food, where 
<br>
to go to school, who to associate with, what language to speak, which websites 
<br>
to visit, etc. etc.  It's bad enough that I go around telling people how to 
<br>
update their probabilistic beliefs about questions of simple fact.
<br>
<p>It is also a good idea to avoid buzzwords.
