The way plus a Friendly goal does tell you what to eat, who to sleep with, 
<br>
etc, though the usual answer is &quot;the expected value of formal consideration 
<br>
is low, follow habit&quot;.  The art of rationality is about deciding the state 
<br>
of the world AND the correct action to take; with the latter taking 
<br>
precedence over the former.  It definitely does tell you &quot;don't waste time 
<br>
on people who are unlikely to follow up&quot; and &quot;don't antagonize potential 
<br>
allies&quot;.  On a factual level, it tells you that arguments from authority are 
<br>
like any other sort of evidence, *not* the terrible sin against logic that 
<br>
people with remaining hang-ups due to religion related frustration often 
<br>
believe them to be.
<br>
Swords shouldn't clash if people are as modest as Heuristics and Biases 
<br>
should make them.  Rather, alternatives should be proposed and considered.  
<br>
Swords shouldn't clash with competent newbies especially, as they are most 
<br>
likely to be driven away to our loss.
<br>
I'm really just asking everyone to act in the way most likely to produce 
<br>
good results.  Economists to the contrary, people don't usually do that, and 
<br>
need reminders.
<br>
I think the condecension Loosemore recieved exceeded that he dished out, and 
<br>
worse, provided Bayesian rational evidence, from his perspective, that we 
<br>
were defensive and argumentative non-truth-seekers.  Push back 1/3  (or 
<br>
whatever) seems like a good empirical heuristic validated by game-theory 
<br>
simulations of noisy prisoners dillemas.
