</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>The point is, though, that &quot;exploits&quot; is shorthand here
<br>
for &quot;tricks that it is extremely improbable that a being
<br>
of human intelligence would ever think of&quot;.
<br>
<p>Given this, in order to show that it is unlikely that
<br>
such exploits exist, you have to show that there are no
<br>
areas in which our model of physics is very incomplete,
<br>
*and* that our model of physics is simple enough that
<br>
the consequences of it fully understandable by humans.
<br>
<p>Conversely, in order to show that the likelihood of
<br>
exploits is, at least, unknown, all Ben and Eliezer
<br>
have to show is that either our model of physics is
<br>
complex enough that the consequences of an action are
<br>
not fully captured by a human understanding of it, or
<br>
that there are areas in which our model of physics
<br>
does not appear to be consistent, or explain observed
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p>When you say that the helicopter/exploit depends on
<br>
the existence of helicopters, you're right, but that's
<br>
irrelevant!  We're in the position of the dog, here,
<br>
not the person who calls for the helicopter.  There is
<br>
no way for a dog to know whether a helicopter he has
<br>
never seen before might show up, and no way for him to
<br>
reason about the possibility.  He can't show that
<br>
helicopters are possible without an example, but that
<br>
has no constraint on likelihood of rescue for the
<br>
&quot;trapped&quot; human.
<br>
<p>If members of the dog pack were to sit around discussing
<br>
(pardon the conceit) whether a cornered human could get
<br>
away via some undogly exploit, an argument that there
<br>
was no known way for a human to get away in any dogly
<br>
understanding of the situation would not be a correct
<br>
argument that the human could not, in fact, get away, as
<br>
we know.
<br>
<p>In any case, a statement that the incompleteness of
<br>
physics is not an argument that exploits are possible
<br>
implies that the stater has delineated the boundaries
<br>
of the incompleteness, and has some procedure to rule
<br>
out exploits within those boundaries.  But if that were
<br>
the case, the areas of incompleteness would be within
<br>
the model, rather than outside it.
<br>
<p>In summary, even if there were an apparently complete
<br>
model of physics, and we could work out the consequences
<br>
of any given action to an indefinite precision and time,
<br>
we would still not have a guarantee of no exploits.  But
<br>
given that we know of areas that are incomplete, and
<br>
given that we know that it's possible to surprise us even
<br>
within ostensibly complete areas, it should be obvious
<br>
that exploits must be assumed to exist for intelligences
<br>
which dwarf our own (if that's possible).
