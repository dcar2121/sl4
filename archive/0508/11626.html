<p><em>&gt; Conversely, in order to show that the likelihood of

</em><br>
<p>But I don't disagree with this, and I don't see why you think I do. I never
<br>
said that it was not the case that the likelihood of exploits is unknown. I
<br>
agreed with this, and disputed those who seemed to take this fact to show that
<br>
it was likely that there were reasonable exploits, an obviously false
<br>
entailment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you say that the helicopter/exploit depends on

</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant!  We're in the position of the dog, here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the person who calls for the helicopter.  
</em><br>
<p>I strongly disagree. Whether we are the dog or the human, the escape is
<br>
possible iff there are helicopters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If members of the dog pack were to sit around discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (pardon the conceit) whether a cornered human could get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away via some undogly exploit, an argument that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was no known way for a human to get away in any dogly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the situation would not be a correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument that the human could not, in fact, get away, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we know.
</em><br>
<p>You're right, but this is not my argument. The fact that there is dogly way the
<br>
human could get away means the dogs may believe that the human has a possible
<br>
way to escape, but cannot justifiably hold that there is a reasonable way to
<br>
escape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, a statement that the incompleteness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics is not an argument that exploits are possible...
</em><br>
<p>NO, NO, NO! REASONABLE, not possible. That physics is incomplete is an argument
<br>
that exploits are possible, but possible isn't much help. The AI wants the
<br>
exploit to be reasonable under a particularly awful set of circumstances.
<br>
Clearly, an exploit could be possible and yet not reasonable under circumstances
<br>
C, or any circumstances at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In summary, even if there were an apparently complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model of physics, and we could work out the consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any given action to an indefinite precision and time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would still not have a guarantee of no exploits. 
</em><br>
<p>But we don't have to guarantee no exploits for it to be unjustified to suppose
<br>
there are any.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; given that we know of areas that are incomplete, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given that we know that it's possible to surprise us even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within ostensibly complete areas, it should be obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that exploits must be assumed to exist for intelligences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which dwarf our own (if that's possible).
</em><br>
<p>If you know of an &quot;exploit&quot; like the ones under discussion, I'd love to hear
<br>
about it. I don't think you have any good reason to suppose reasonable exploits
<br>
exist.
