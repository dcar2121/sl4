Daniel, I think at this point I have to say:  Study some probability theory. 
<br>
You're arguing, as though it were a basic principle of rationality, a 
<br>
principle of probability assignment which simply would not be well-calibrated 
<br>
in practice.
<br>
<p>You seem to believe that in the absence of &quot;specific support&quot; - which is 
<br>
apparently something you get to define, if none of the historically similar 
<br>
situations from dogs to Lord Kelvin count as generalizable cases - you must 
<br>
assign probability zero.  This is flatly wrong.  If you read 
<br>
<a href="http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html">http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/technical.html</a> you will see why you should never 
<br>
assign probability zero to anything.
<br>
<p>Since you cannot assign probability zero, what probability must you assign? 
<br>
Note that I do not say &quot;may&quot; assign.  Rationality is a precise art.  All that 
<br>
is not prohibited is mandatory, all that is not mandatory is prohibited. 
<br>
Water does not choose where to flow but only flows downhill, and probability 
<br>
flows similarly in a Bayesian reasoner.
<br>
<p>Technical rules for assigning probability in the absence of specific support 
<br>
include maximum entropy and Kolmogorov complexity.  Neither is readily 
<br>
applicable to calculate a quantitative probability for the AI case.  The best 
<br>
probability estimate we can get is by analogy to historical cases from dogs to 
<br>
Lord Kelvin.  End of story!  You cannot demand a specific account of how an AI 
<br>
could break free from a box, else assign probability zero.  It is like asking 
<br>
for a specific account of how an opponent could win a game of Go against you, 
<br>
else assigning probability zero to your loss.  It is like saying that a 
<br>
lottery ticket has probability zero of winning, unless someone gives you a 
<br>
specific reason why those numbers will win.  You can (therefore must) assign 
<br>
negligible non-zero probabilities to each element of the search space, and 
<br>
assign a larger non-zero probability for the entire search space.
<br>
<p>There is simply no principle of probability theory that says that, if you 
<br>
cannot exhibit a specific element of the Go search space that wins against 
<br>
you, you must assign probability zero to the whole search space without 
<br>
searching it.
<br>
<p>If you permit (and you must permit) historical generalizations about similar 
<br>
but not identical situations, such as past games of Go, in the absence of 
<br>
specific exhibited possible winning moves against you, then you must permit 
<br>
historical generalizations about similar failures of physical theory and 
<br>
failures of imagination, in the absence of specific exhibited possible winning 
<br>
moves against you.
<br>
<p>I think that's essentially the end of the discussion so far as I'm concerned. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are simply using probability theory incorrectly.  If you read up on 
<br>
technical rules for assigning probability in the absence of specific support, 
<br>
you will probably get a better idea of where your verbal argument goes wrong, 
<br>
even though you cannot use these methods to calculate a quantitative 
<br>
probability in this case.
<br>
<p>Rationality is supposed to work.  It is supposed to produce correct answers 
<br>
and well-calibrated probability assignments.  If you believe that some 
<br>
principle of rationality requires you to assign a zero probability to 
<br>
something that could actually go ahead and happen, or a negligible probability 
<br>
to something that stands a good chance of really happening, then whatever you 
<br>
are doing is not rationality.  Do not say that your art failed you; you failed 
<br>
your art.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure there's anything anyone can say to you beyond that.  You appear 
<br>
to have leaped to a conclusion and to be using an alleged principle of 
<br>
rationality to justify it, which principle accords not with probability 
<br>
theory, nor exhibits qualitative correspondence to common sense.  No one else 
<br>
here agrees with your principle and you have made no case for it.  If you 
<br>
continue to appeal to the principle, you will convince yourself but no one else.
<br>
