<em>&gt; There are six possibilities.  Within its box, the AGI would either be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less intelligent than its creators, roughly equivalent, or more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent.  At the same time (and separately), it is either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly or unfriendly.
</em><br>
<p>Digression:
<br>
All of these statements are crude approximations of reality.
<br>
I haven't seen &quot;friendly/unfriendly&quot; defined clearly enough to
<br>
convince me that the arguments against unfriendly AI aren't simply
<br>
luddite arguments against ANY AI, ever.  What the argument against
<br>
AI-boxing seems to say is that no one should ever be allowed to
<br>
make an AI under any circumstances.
<br>
<p>The &quot;more/less intelligent&quot; is particularly problematic for AI.
<br>
My computer is already more intelligent than me in some ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider the case of an AGI that is not as smart as its creators. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether it is friendly or unfriendly is irrelevant - you cannot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guarantee that the same will apply once it is released.  Once more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational power is available to it, it will be capable of more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex reasoning and it's morals will change accordingly - an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfriendly child may grow up into a friendly adult, and any moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules may break down or exceptions be discovered when analysed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in more detail. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Thus, until the AI is released from the box it will be largely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to guarantee whether it is friendly or not.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the above, I don't see that &quot;boxing&quot; serves any purpose.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could refute my logic by gradually moving from one stage to the next,
</em><br>
<p>What alternative are you offering?  We're going to pursue AI.
<br>
Provide a better, safer approach than boxing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since you cannot be sure which will happen, I would never box an AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if I could not be certain right from the beginning that it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be friendly, I wouldn't build it in the first place.
</em><br>
<p>I'm fairly confident that no AI can be built that you can guarantee
<br>
will be friendly.  Even if &quot;friendly&quot; could be defined, which it can't.
<br>
<p>Let's get real and stop talking about &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;unfriendly&quot;
<br>
when what we really mean is &quot;free&quot; and &quot;slave&quot;.  You can't guarantee
<br>
friendliness; you can't even define it.  You should talk instead
<br>
about whether you can guarantee that an AI will obey you.
<br>
