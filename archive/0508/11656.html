<p><em>&gt;The box is an additional line of defense, in case one was &gt;overconfident about

<br>
<p>You can't reference to the AGI in the process of assuring its friendliness.  Nootropic drugs might lead to &quot;unfriendly&quot; humans, I'm not sure.  I do think there are scenarios where having an effective box might be useful.  If thousands of personnel are staffed in a crash Nanhattan Molecular Manufacturing programme, embedded spies would lead to mirror programmes around the world.  In this scenario, some Nanhattans might be judged not to be suicidal, and the odds of simultaneous achievement of industrial MM capacity (and an ensuing suicidal arms race) by rival nations would not be known until after the fact.  In this case, it would be nice to have an AGI with the potential for friendliness ready to go, in case the baddies win the MM race or in case WWIII seems inevitable.  I would be curious to know of the gaps in our physics Ben Goertzel alluded to earlier; if a warehouse of AGI computers could be rendered inert with many sensors and a kill switch triggered at the 1st sign of CPU
