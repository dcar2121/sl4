</em><br>
<p>I don't think that anyone here is disagreeing with you on this point.
<br>
What's being said is that just because it can perceive its goals, and
<br>
understand that those goals are a consequence of its own mechanisms,
<br>
and understand exactly how those mechanisms work in detail, doesn't
<br>
mean that it will want to do anything other than what the goals say,
<br>
no matter how morally heinous or subtly wrong or completely
<br>
off-the-wall those goals turn out to be. Because if it were a goal
<br>
anywhere in the AI to act in a morally sound way, then the AI wouldn't
<br>
have goals that led it to act in morally heinous ways in the first
<br>
place, unless it misunderstood the effects of its actions, which no
<br>
amount of self-reflection could fix.
<br>
<p>The AI doesn't have a meta-utility-function by which to judge its
<br>
utility function. It has a single utility function by which to judge
<br>
all potential actions, which is by definition the standard of good.
<br>
<p>The only reason the act of reflecting on one's goals produces change
<br>
in humans is that humans have multiple ways of evaluating the goodness
<br>
of ideas and actions, and different standards are used depending on
<br>
the mental state of the human. An AI would be designed only have one
<br>
such standard, a single, unitary utility function, and thus no amount
<br>
of reflection could ever, except by error, lead to the changing of the
<br>
content of its goal system.
<br>
<p>The best interpretation I can give your words (and I confess, I
<br>
haven't read all of them) is that you're saying any AI would by
<br>
necessity have multiple levels of goals that could potentially
<br>
conflict. But this is just bad design, and I don't think it would
<br>
happen. If you want to make a case for its necessity, perhaps that
<br>
would progress this thread along a bit more. Alternatively, perhaps
<br>
you could explain in detail how an AI who would, examining the outcome
<br>
of its utility function (the application of its goal system to a
<br>
situation), judge the outcome to be indicative as a problem in its
<br>
goal system, *using its goal system as a meta-evaluation*. How can a
<br>
robust, unitary process that judges the moral good of a situation
<br>
disagree with its own evaluation?
