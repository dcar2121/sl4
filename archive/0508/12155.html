<p>
I was thinking how much easier my life could be if I could
<br>
reprogram myself to be attracted by intelligence and kindness
<br>
more than by breast and waist size.  If I were capable of
<br>
reprogramming myself that way, I might.
<br>
<p>Formerly, if Richard Loosemore had made this observation,
<br>
I would have responded by saying that this meant that my
<br>
behavior was being driven by some different values, or
<br>
some lower level of values.
<br>
<p>If there is some lower level of values, it would probably
<br>
be something such as the laws of thermodynamics, and that's
<br>
too low a level of analysis to be useful.
<br>
<p>Yes, my behavior in that case would be driven by different values,
<br>
but why can't this happen?:  An organism with the ability to
<br>
reprogram itself has drives A, B, and C.  Drives A and B conspire
<br>
to replace drive C with drive Z.  Drives B and Z then conspire to
<br>
replace drive A with drive X.  Drives X and Z then conspire to
<br>
replace drive B with drive Y.  The organism now has drives X, Y,
<br>
and Z, instead of A, B, and C, despite always having been
<br>
controlled by pre-existing drives.
<br>
