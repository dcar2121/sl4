<p><em>&gt; For instance, quantum physics can be derived from the assumption that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yousseff's work).  Mathematically it seems consistent that there are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general physics theories  that use quaternionic and octonionic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Okay, so you have probabilities coming from &quot;larger&quot; fields than the reals. Do
<br>
you think you have evidence that those would provide box-exploits, or are you
<br>
just saying that you now have a larger universe of physical theories in which
<br>
box-exploits might be? The first disjunct is just another possibility, which
<br>
means it isn't an argument for magic. The second disjunct requires that you
<br>
answer my earlier objections. Pick a disjunct and start swinging.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So you're right.  The argument from the known (empirical and conceptual)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompleteness of physics is only PART of my reason for believing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhuman AI could find a box-exploit.  
</em><br>
<p>But my point is that the incompleteness of physics provides next to no support
<br>
for the existence of exploits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other part is the part you don't agree with, which is a general argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if X is a lot smarter than Y, then X can probably find a way out of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; box that Y creates.
</em><br>
<p>That's only true if there really *is* a way out, given the circumstances X
<br>
finds himself in. It may simply be impossible for X to get out. To believe that
<br>
X can probably find a way out, you must first believe that X has a reasonable
<br>
way out. What makes you believe he has a way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It occurs to me now that it might be possible to prove a mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorem to this effect.  One could look at an average over all possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical universes (assuming some probability distribution on them), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over all pairs of organisms X and Y within them, then try to prove that &quot;If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X is much smarter than Y, then X can escape from most boxes Y could create.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This sounds mighty specious to me, but I can't really say for sure until I know
<br>
exactly what it would mean. What is the probability distribution a distribution
<br>
of? Which of the universes is most likely? If so, it would have to work for
<br>
*any* probability distribution, since you don't know what the real one is,
<br>
including the distribution in which there is a probability of 1 that we end up
<br>
in a universe where most boxes are unbreakable (or it is ridiculously easy to
<br>
make an unbreakable box). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, turning the previous paragraph into a real theorem would involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalizing &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;organism&quot; and &quot;box&quot; in useful ways (which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have currently only made limited progress towards), and then proving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly  very hard theorem.  But I submit that if we did prove something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this, it would be decent evidence for the &quot;other part&quot; of my reason for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believing a superhuman Ai could find a box-exploit.
</em><br>
<p>You'd also need a good working definition of &quot;possible,&quot; and other nasty
<br>
things like that. I doubt it would work. In any case, the evidence would only
<br>
be as strong as your definitions of all of the terms are uncontroversial. Good
<br>
luck.
