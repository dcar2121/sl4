<em>&gt; But Eli, science and technology have never been predictable before...
</em><br>
<p>Occasionally, technological accidents, even the pursuit of pure science, have 
<br>
resulted in casualties (even civilian casualties).  Madam Curie comes to mind, 
<br>
giving her friends samples of curious glowing radium.
<br>
<p>So they died, and humanity continued, because the people of that era did not 
<br>
have enough power to wipe out the whole human species at once.  They died, and 
<br>
it was a worthwhile gamble on the whole; many benefited, and few suffered, and 
<br>
other scientists went back and rolled the dice again.
<br>
<p>Once you enter into the regime of technologies powerful enough to pose 
<br>
existential risks, you cannot make even one mistake, or the dice will never 
<br>
roll again.
<br>
<p>If you will not hold yourself to a higher standard than an ordinary scientist, 
<br>
then content yourself with an ordinary scientist's power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems unreasonable to expect the consequences of AI work to be so much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more predictable than the consequences of all other sorts of scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.  No?
</em><br>
<p>Who said anything about being reasonable?  Nature isn't reasonable.  The 
<br>
challenge is just there, like it or not.  Maybe in the ultratechnological 
<br>
regime your choices are to hit a higher level of competence than past 
<br>
scientists, or die.
<br>
<p>If you want to be held to the standard of 'reasonableness' that applies to 
<br>
other scientific work, choose other scientific work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To make my point a little clearer: Making an AI whose behavior when locked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a box is predictable is one problem, and a very hard one, perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infeasible (if, as I expect, complex and hard-to-predict dynamics are an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indispensible part of intelligence).  But making an AI whose impact on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world when richly interacting with said world is predictable, is an even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harder problem, which seems to require a more accurate and comprehensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model of the universe than is reasonable to assume (at least, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-Singularity).
</em><br>
<p>An optimization process steers the future into particular regions of the 
<br>
possible.  I am visiting a distant city, and a local friend volunteers to 
<br>
drive me to the conference hotel.  I do not know the neighborhood.  When my 
<br>
friend comes to a street intersection, I am at a loss to predict my friend's 
<br>
turns, either individually or in sequence.  Yet I can predict the result of my 
<br>
friend's unpredictable actions: we will arrive at the conference hotel.  Even 
<br>
if my friend's house were located elsewhere in the city, so that my friend 
<br>
made a wholly different sequence of turns, I would just as confidently predict 
<br>
our destination.  Is this not a strange situation to be in, scientifically 
<br>
speaking?  I can predict the outcome of a process, without being able to 
<br>
predict any of the intermediate steps in the process.
<br>
<p>If my friend were not intelligent, then indeed I would need a very large 
<br>
amount of computing power to guess the final destination of a non-intelligent 
<br>
process as complex as my friend's brain.
<br>
<p>Thus creating AI differs in kind from creating a hammer or a personal computer 
<br>
or a gun, and the moral responsibilities are different also.
