On September 22, 2005, distinguished scientist and bestselling author Ray
<br>
Kurzweil's The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology will be
<br>
published. But you needn't wait. In partnership with Ray Kurzweil, the
<br>
Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence is giving an advance
<br>
signed edition to everyone contributing $200 or more to the Institute.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil's follow-up to his bestseller The Age of Spiritual Machines is an
<br>
in-depth analysis of emerging technologies and the transformation we'll
<br>
undertake as the line between human and machine disappears. With a 20-year
<br>
track record of accurate predictions, Kurzweil has produced what is certain
<br>
to become one of the most important and widely discussed books of 2005.

<p>WHAT IS THE SINGULARITY INSTITUTE?
<br>
<p>The Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, SIAI, is a nonprofit
<br>
research think tank and public interest institute for the study and
<br>
advancement of beneficial artificial intelligence and ethical cognitive
<br>
enhancement. Since cognitive ability influences how well difficult problems
<br>
can be solved, SIAI aims to further the safe and significant enhancement of
<br>
cognition to make contemporary humanitarian challenges generally more
<br>
solvable. The Singularity Institute has the additional goal of fostering a
<br>
broader discussion and understanding of beneficial artificial intelligence.
<br>
<p>For more about SIAI's charitable purpose, see:

<br>
Near. Monthly donors giving at least $30 each month toward the requested
<br>
$200 will receive The Singularity Is Near immediately upon availability.
<br>
Your contributions are 100% tax deductible in the United States and Canada.

<p>THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR QUOTES
<br>
<p>&quot;Ray Kurzweil's intriguing new book envisions a future in which information
<br>
technologies have advanced so far and fast that they enable humanity to
<br>
transcend its biological limitations - transforming our lives in ways we
<br>
can't yet imagine.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Bill Gates
<br>
<p>&quot;If you have ever wondered about the nature and impact of the next profound
<br>
discontinuities that will fundamentally change the way we live, work, and
<br>
perceive our world, read this book. Kurzweil's Singularity is a tour de
<br>
force, imagining the unimaginable and eloquently exploring the coming
<br>
disruptive events that will alter our fundamental perspectives as
<br>
significantly as did electricity and the computer.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Dean Kamen, physicist and inventor of the first wearable insulin
<br>
pump, HomeChoice portable dialysis machine, IBOT Mobility System, and Segway
<br>
Human Transporter; recipient of the National Medal of Technology
<br>
<p>&quot;Ray's optimistic book well merits both reading and thoughtful response. For
<br>
those like myself whose views differ from Ray's on the balance of promise
<br>
and peril, The Singularity Is Near is a clear call for a continuing dialogue
<br>
to address the greater concerns arising from these accelerating
<br>
possibilities.&quot;

<br>
<p>AN EXCERPT FROM THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR
<br>
<p>Chapter One - The Six Epochs
<br>
<p>&quot;I am not sure when I first became aware of the Singularity. I'd have to say
<br>
it was a progressive awakening. In the almost half century that I've
<br>
immersed myself in computer and related technologies, I've sought to
<br>
understand the meaning and purpose of the continual upheaval that I have
<br>
witnessed at many levels. Gradually, I've become aware of a transforming
<br>
event looming in the first half of the twenty-first century. Just as a black
<br>
hole in space dramatically alters the patterns of matter and energy
<br>
accelerating toward its event horizon, this impending Singularity in our
<br>
future is increasingly transforming every institution and aspect of human
<br>
life, from sexuality to spirituality.
<br>
<p>&quot;What, then, is the Singularity? It's a future period during which the pace
<br>
of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human
<br>
life will be irreversibly transformed. Although neither utopian nor
<br>
dystopian, this epoch will transform the concepts that we rely on to give
<br>
meaning to our lives, from our business models to the cycle of human life,
<br>
including death itself. Understanding the Singularity will alter our
<br>
perspective on the significance of our past and the ramifications for our
<br>
future. To truly understand it inherently changes one's view of life in
<br>
general and one's own particular life. I regard someone who understands the
<br>
Singularity and who has reflected on its implications for his or her own
<br>
life as a singularitarian.
<br>
<p>&quot;I can understand why many observers do not readily embrace the obvious
<br>
implications of what I have called the law of accelerating returns (the
<br>
inherent acceleration of the rate of evolution, with technological evolution
<br>
as a continuation of biological evolution). After all, it took me forty
<br>
years to be able to see what was right in front of me, and I still cannot 
<br>
say that I am entirely comfortable with all of its consequences.&quot;
<br>
<p>TECH CENTRAL STATION'S EARLY REVIEW OF THE SINGULARITY IS NEAR 
<br>
<p>&quot;The singularity is a future period in which technological progress becomes
<br>
so rapid that it radically transforms humankind. To picture the singularity
<br>
imagine computers trillions of times smarter than Newton, Einstein and
<br>
Edison inventing new technologies while continually enhancing their own
<br>
abilities. Ray Kurzweil argues that the Singularity will occur around 2045.&quot;
