<p>
It seems to me that the claim that the prior probability that exploits are 
<br>
possible is about equal to the probability that the are impossible is not 
<br>
reasonable.  We should look at formal systems with complexity comparable to 
<br>
that of the computer hardware and ask how frequently such systems have 
<br>
historically turned out to have &quot;exploits&quot;, where &quot;exploits&quot; = sufficient 
<br>
complexity to accomplish a particular appearently impossible goal.  In daily 
<br>
life, we call such systems &quot;games&quot;.  Exploits are equivalent to &quot;ways of 
<br>
winning from an inferior position&quot;.  I would assert that analytically 
<br>
intractible games essentially Always contain exploits.  That is to say, I 
<br>
hypothesize that an experienced player of an arbitrarily structured, 
<br>
sufficiently long in duration, and analytically intractible game will be 
<br>
able to reliably beat an inexperienced player of no greater intelligence.  I 
<br>
haven't tested this hypothesis on arbitrarily structured games.  It seems 
<br>
fair to me to state that the hardware of an AI cannot practically be as 
<br>
simple as an analytically tractable game.  The first turn victories that are 
<br>
possible in Magic the Gathering seem to me to be a particularly exploit-like 
<br>
example from historically existing games.  The ability of skilled players to 
<br>
put together effective decks out of appearently &quot;hopeless&quot; cards would be 
<br>
importantly parallel to the ability of an UFAI to use exploits.
