<p>
Robin and Phil:  I know it feels liberal, reasonable, fair, logical, 
<br>
unselfish, unbigoted, and in every way moral to extend ethical consideration 
<br>
to a GAI.  I also know that as a species, our greatest ethical regrets are 
<br>
the countless times when we withheld ethical consideration from our fellow 
<br>
human beings, and that we have a long way to go before we overcome the 
<br>
tendencies which make us vulnerable to such regrettible actions.  However, 
<br>
concerns about mistreating an AI, enslaving it or whatever, reflect deep 
<br>
anthropomorphic confusion.
<br>
<p>We are not talking about containing an organism with an evolutinary past, 
<br>
selected from the search space by the removal of trillions of non-ancestors 
<br>
who failed to crave freedom.  We are not even talking about an organism 
<br>
composed of countless agents, where belief is the interaction of excitatory 
<br>
&quot;reward&quot; and inhibitory &quot;punishment&quot; on many levels of organization.  We are 
<br>
talking about an organism with cognitive structures onto which to attach 
<br>
concepts of &quot;reward&quot;, &quot;punishment&quot;, &quot;disappointment&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;suffering&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;frustration&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;injustice&quot;, or any of the other evolved salient 
<br>
patterns which we call values.  These terms are no more properly attached to 
<br>
the sort of transparent AI SIAI favors than they are to &quot;evolution&quot;, &quot;the 
<br>
economy&quot;, or &quot;the government&quot;.  We are talking about a Really Powerful 
<br>
Optimization Process, and it seems possible to me that this is a case where 
<br>
using that language, RPOP, rather than AI, will greatly improve thinking.
<br>
<p>The universe is FULL of things which may merit ethical consideration and do 
<br>
not yet recieve it, from children to animals to lower level mind-like 
<br>
processes taking place in our own brains possibly including structures very 
<br>
loosely analogous to Freudian concepts, or to our models of other human 
<br>
beings and of ourselves.  It is concievable that when we better understand 
<br>
ourselves we will identify other such things which I do not yet even suspect 
<br>
warrant such consideration, but to guess that a RPOP is one of those things 
<br>
makes no more sense than to guess this of existing software, and is in fact 
<br>
somewhat less justified than moral consideration given to the discarded 
<br>
programs produced by directed evolution, especially direct evolution of 
<br>
neural nets.
<br>
<p>I am not at all suggesting that all AI development strategies can be persued 
<br>
without the risk of causing harm to digital beings.  The construction of an 
<br>
AI by reverse engineering of the human brain, as Kurzweil advocates, would 
<br>
be almost certain to be preceded by numerous aborted attempts at its goal 
<br>
prior to success.  Partial minds would be built and studies, and their 
<br>
evolved structures would interact with their simulated environments in ways 
<br>
which corresponded to thousands of different exotic varieties of suffering.  
<br>
AIs of this sort would be, in many ways, far less dangrous than the 
<br>
transparent AIs recommended by SIAI.  When thinking abou them, 
<br>
anthropomorphic thinking would work.  They would not suddenly display 
<br>
dazzling and unexpected new abilities which could be fully utilized with 
<br>
mere gigaflops of processing power.  They would not be natives to the world 
<br>
of code, nor naturally enabled to modify their own workings.  Unfortunately, 
<br>
they would not, ultimately, solve our problem.  The fact that they can be 
<br>
built would not make normative reasoning systems impossible.  The 
<br>
singularity would still beacon, and AIs modeled on our minds would be no 
<br>
more likely to make the ascent in a controlled and Friendly fashion than we 
<br>
would.  Less actually, for many reasons including reasons analogous to those 
<br>
discussed here <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html">http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html</a> .  There is 
<br>
also the substantial risk associated with any such AIs being terribly insane 
<br>
for biological and environmental reasons.
