Mitchell Porter:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This discussion is obscured by the use of concepts from human psychology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such as 'obsession', 'motivation', and 'pleasure'.
</em><br>
<p>Richard Loosemore:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The discussion is not obscured by this issue.  I am using such terms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advisedly, because they pertain to a type of mechanism (note: mechanism, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not metaphysical or nonphysical entity) that I am trying to bring into the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion.
</em><br>
<p>And also said (in &quot;Retrenchment&quot;):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And if you mentioned &quot;motivation&quot;, &quot;compulsion&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;obsession&quot; or &quot;pleasure&quot; they would assume you were just using these as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shorthand for certain mechanisms, rather than assuming you were talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dualist philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>I have lately concluded that any literal attribution of psychological or 
<br>
phenomenal states to a classical computer should require either dualism or 
<br>
eliminativism, because assertions of literal *identity* between such states, 
<br>
and *any* state definable in terms of presently acknowledged physical 
<br>
properties, are metaphysically outlandish; and that the relevant dualism, 
<br>
while not metaphysically outlandish, would be extremely complex in its 
<br>
specification, since it would have to posit some association between mental 
<br>
states and physical states by way of &quot;computational states&quot;, but the 
<br>
definition of computational states in terms of physical states is usually 
<br>
done only using fuzzy predicates, whereas this association (being by 
<br>
hypothesis a sort of fundamental law) would have to be an exact one, and I 
<br>
see no especially natural way to draw the exact lines in microphysical state 
<br>
space that will define the &quot;computational states&quot; that are to be the 
<br>
physical counterparts of the mental states. So an AI-friendly dualism is 
<br>
logically possible, but unlikely because of the necessary complexity of its 
<br>
&quot;psychophysical bridging laws&quot;.
<br>
<p>People feel warranted to make such identifications (of thought with 
<br>
computation, for example) because they think the brain has been shown to be 
<br>
a classical information processor, and so that it simply *must* be true. For 
<br>
my part, my a-priori objections to it (which have grown greater as I have 
<br>
thought further about the nature of the two things that are being portrayed 
<br>
as one) lead me to consider (i) scientific heterodoxies such as quantum 
<br>
brain theories (ii) ontologies other than naturalism.
<br>
<p>I say all this just so you understand exactly where I'm coming from when I 
<br>
assert that a machine feels nothing, has no motivations or goals, etc. I do 
<br>
fundamentally dispute the legitimacy of equating psychological and 
<br>
computational concepts, even though this is taken for granted by most people 
<br>
in cognitive psychology, most people in AI, most people concerned with the 
<br>
Singularity, and perhaps a majority of the scientifically minded public.
<br>
<p>However, the issue of safety in AI design is to some extent logically 
<br>
independent of such considerations. One may consider an AI to be a 
<br>
self-organizing physical system, without attributing any genuine mentality 
<br>
to it whatsoever, and still agree with arguments about it made in 
<br>
mentalistic language, so long as they have a translation in terms of (say) 
<br>
the purely causal or computational.
<br>
<p>In any case, having re-read your book excerpt, I've noticed an interesting 
<br>
feature of your argument. In previous discussions of goal systems on this 
<br>
list, and how they might go astray, the AI analogue of &quot;wireheading&quot; often 
<br>
comes up. Just as a human might sidestep the laborious aspects of 
<br>
pleasurable activity by instead directly stimulating their pleasure centers, 
<br>
an AI capable of self-modification might increase the (self-assessed) 
<br>
utility of its actions simply by changing the assessment criteria, rather 
<br>
than by acting on the world in new ways. Your argument that an evil 
<br>
intelligence would choose to adopt good motivations, but not vice versa, on 
<br>
the grounds that the nature of the universe offers a benign intelligence 
<br>
greater opportunities for pleasure, actually turns the temptation behind 
<br>
wireheading into the thing that saves us! You could even extend the argument 
<br>
to say why, on purely selfish grounds, a benign intelligence might remain 
<br>
benevolently engaged with the rest of the universe, rather than hiding away 
<br>
in a Dyson sphere and literally wireheading itself - because the payoff for 
<br>
expansive engagement will necessarily eventually exceed any possible payoff 
<br>
accompanying solitary self-reconstruction.
<br>
<p>However, such broad assertions about the prospects accompanying different 
<br>
cosmic lifestyles must be argued for at much greater length. If the universe 
<br>
is indeed &quot;a fragile place where order and harmony are rare, always 
<br>
competing against the easy forces of chaos&quot;, then to side with life sets you 
<br>
up for frustration and heartbreak. If creation is a painful struggle that 
<br>
must nonetheless be motivated by pleasure, it would appear to require 
<br>
auto-sado-masochistic motivations, in which some of the pleasure derives 
<br>
from anticipation of the relief from painful struggle which success (or even 
<br>
just definitive failure) will bring. And so forth.
<br>
<p>So I would add this intuitive criticism to the more technical ones offered 
<br>
already. You could call it the Argument from Angst: Even if the AI is human 
<br>
enough in its response to reality to attach significance to the 
<br>
considerations you originally listed, it will have to weigh them against 
<br>
equally real and cogent reasons for adopting an attitude of caution, 
<br>
pessimism, or nihilism.
