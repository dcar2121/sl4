<p>
Everyone,
<br>
<p>(But particularly in response to Michael Wilson, who has been engaging 
<br>
me in off-list debate)
<br>
<p>I am getting a lot of the following rather comical pattern of argument, 
<br>
so I thought I would share it with you all:
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) You haven't produced any arguments that mean anything.
<br>
<p>ME) Okay, I'll try again.  There is a very general argument, from 
<br>
Complex Systems theory, that says that if something of the complexity of 
<br>
an AGI has a goal system, and a thinking system that is capable of 
<br>
building and making use of sophisticated representations of (among other 
<br>
things) the structure and behavior of its own goal system, then it would 
<br>
be extraordinarily unlikely if that AGI's behavior was straightforwardly 
<br>
determined by the goal system itself, because the feedback loop between 
<br>
goal system and thinking system would be so sensitive to other 
<br>
influences that it would bring pretty much the entire rest of the 
<br>
universe into the equation.  The overall behavior, in other words, would 
<br>
be a Complex (capital C) conjunction of goal system and representational 
<br>
system, and it would be meaningless to assert that it would still be 
<br>
equivalent to a modified or augmented form of the original goal system. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason we need to be very careful when we try to draw 
<br>
conclusions about how the AGI would behave.
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) You still haven't given any arguments to support your 
<br>
contention.
<br>
<p>ME) What?! To anyone who understood what I meant by &quot;Complex System&quot; the 
<br>
above contention is transparent.  It is one of the most basic claims of 
<br>
the CS folks, observed over and over, in many types of system.
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) We have already looked at Complex Systems Theory and it is 
<br>
a waste of time.
<br>
<p>ME) So you know a lot about Complex Systems Theory?  Good: can you tell 
<br>
me what is wrong with the above argument, then?  How can the CS folks 
<br>
have been so wrong about one of their most basic observations?
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) [Various arguments against *Chaos Theory*, but presented 
<br>
as if this were Complex Systems]
<br>
<p>ME) Huh? That's Chaos Theory!!  What has that got to do with anything? 
<br>
Is that what people think I mean by &quot;Complex Systems&quot;?  No wonder they 
<br>
keep saying its not relevant.
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) [Various discussion about *Kolmogorov complexity*, 
<br>
presented as if this were the same as &quot;Complex Systems&quot;]
<br>
<p>ME) Huh? Why are you changing the subject and talking about Kolmogorov 
<br>
complexity now?!  *Please get back to the point* and say what is wrong 
<br>
with Complex Systems Theory.  Have you actually studied that field?  Do 
<br>
you know enough to distinguish it from Chaos Theory and Kormogorov 
<br>
complexity?
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) Do, I haven't studied Complex Systems Theory:  I don't 
<br>
need to, its a waste of time.
<br>
<p>ME) So you (a) don't understand it, but (b) know it is a waste of time? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of sophistry is this?
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) I know enough to know its a waste of time.  Besides, what 
<br>
have the Complex Systems people achieved?
<br>
<p>ME) If you don't understand it, don't engage me in debate about it!
<br>
<p>SOMEONE ELSE) There is nothing here to debate:  you don't produce 
<br>
arguments, you just make vague appeals to higher authority.  And you 
<br>
don't understand what anyone else is trying to explain to you. &quot;There
<br>
is inevitably some pride swallowing (proportional to one's self-assessed 
<br>
level of expertise) in accepting that people have been where you are, 
<br>
thought about everything you're likely to say about it and moved on, but 
<br>
again this is something all of our competent researchers went through 
<br>
when they joined [SL4].&quot; (direct quote from Michael Wilson).
<br>
<p>ME) Pride swallowing?  Indeed.  So you need humility on this list?  So 
<br>
maybe you sometimes need to be aware of your own limitations, and go do 
<br>
a bit of reading to catch up?  Couldn't agree more.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>To anyone else who might be tempted to think that blanket ignorance of a 
<br>
domain of inquiry makes them plenty qualified to shoot down arguments 
<br>
coming from within that domain, I should make it clear that I have no 
<br>
interest in debate on those terms.
<br>
<p>For those of you with a genuine interest in the issues that I was trying 
<br>
to raise, you would probably enjoy reading M. Mitchell Waldrop's 
<br>
&quot;Complexity&quot;.  It would help to combine this with a good long look at 
<br>
Godel Escher Bach (Hofstadter) as well, although you should bear in mind 
<br>
that the term &quot;Complex Systems&quot; didn't really come into widespread use 
<br>
until after Hofstadter wrote GEB.   I believe Hofstadter later said that 
<br>
GEB was filled to the brim with the spirit of CS, even though he didn't 
<br>
refer to it that way (I can't remember where exactly he said this though 
<br>
- does anyone have that reference?).
<br>
<p>I am writing a more detailed analysis of some of these issues, as I 
<br>
promised earlier, but this is almost a book-length project, so it goes 
<br>
slowly.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
