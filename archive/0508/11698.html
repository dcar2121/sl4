<em>&gt; Since anything in reality could in principle be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented with 100% accuracy as a 'conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought' in your mind (IF you were cognitively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhanced enough), it follows that anything in reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be represented by the same underlying cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles underpinning your value judgments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Induction, Deduction).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This provides a way to bridge the is/ought gap.
</em><br>
<p>Marc,
<br>
<p>I do understand your basic point, I think.
<br>
<p>You're saying that anything in objective reality could be contained within
<br>
the subjective reality of a hypothetical sufficiently powerful mind.
<br>
<p>And you're saying that anything contained in a mind is constructed according
<br>
to certain cognitive principles, including principles of deductive and
<br>
inductive reasoning.
<br>
<p>This second point is a bit confusing, because induction and deduction are
<br>
procedures of inference not methods of *representation*.  However, one can
<br>
say that inductive and deductive reasoning are the processes a mind would
<br>
use to figure out a compact representation of some entity.  In that sense
<br>
one can perhaps associate an entity with a series of inductive and deductive
<br>
reasoning steps.  Is this what you mean, or am I missing something?  Can you
<br>
give me an example of how you intend inductive and deductive processes to be
<br>
used for knowledge representation?
<br>
<p>Next, you're saying that chains of deductive/inductive reasoning can be
<br>
meaningfully assessed via various valuation methods.  And you're saying that
<br>
in order for a mind to trust in its own reasoning at all, it must accept the
<br>
proposition in the former sentence -- if not, then its reasoning would be
<br>
untrustworthy from its own point of view.
<br>
<p>So, ultimately, you're arguing that if any mind trusts its own reasoning
<br>
processes, then this mind can assess the &quot;value&quot; of an entity in objective
<br>
reality via assessing the value of the chain of cognitive processes it uses
<br>
to reconstruct this entity within its own mind (or would use to do so, if it
<br>
had the memory/processing power).
<br>
<p>I don't think this kind of argumentation deserves the label &quot;Theorem&quot;, which
<br>
should really be reserved for statements proved with mathematical rigor.
<br>
But that is a stylistic point and if you don't agree with me, that's your
<br>
right, obviously.
<br>
<p>I don't really see what this has to do with ethics or morality, though.
<br>
Indeed, as you say, I can try to assess the value of the cognitive processes
<br>
I would use to reconstruct the Holocaust within my mind if I had more memory
<br>
and processing power.  But, I don't see how this is much deeper than just
<br>
saying (for example) &quot;Yes, there is a universal morality, because we can
<br>
model the universe as a computer, so everything in the universe is made of
<br>
bits, and we can define the value of X as the number of bits in X.&quot;
<br>
