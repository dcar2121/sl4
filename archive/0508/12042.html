</em><br>
<p>Interpreting sensory data from the real world requires signal
<br>
processing, and generating actions for an embodied agent
<br>
requires at least some control theory. I'm a strong critic
<br>
of the whole peripheral/code divide when (GOFAI) researchers
<br>
declare the bulk of perception 'peripheral', but I accept
<br>
that the specifics of the early stages of the information
<br>
extraction process or the late stages of action generation
<br>
are noncritical parts of an architecture specification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Look at Chris Eliasmith's book, &quot;Neural engineering&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an excellent start on constructing modular systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of neural networks.
</em><br>
<p>This is much closer to Loosemore's position, though I'm not
<br>
/sure/ that he's proposing to use emergence to build an AGI
<br>
(it just seems likely). As I've doubtless made clear, I
<br>
consider this silly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can begin to see how you might solve the 100-step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, when you see how to construct neural networks to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement each of those 100 steps, where each step is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal processing step such as performing a Fourier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transform, or mapping deltas into absolute values.
</em><br>
<p>In engineering we do this by designing the appropriate
<br>
algorithms. Clearly the relevant specialist theory is
<br>
helpful whenever one designs a specialist algorithm, be it
<br>
signal processing, edge detection or physics simulation.
<br>
But this is learned complexity, that we want an AGI to
<br>
induce from an environment or possibly some processed
<br>
knowledge source. I assume that you're claiming that we
<br>
need control theory and signal processing to design the
<br>
basic substrate of the AI, before it learns anything. I
<br>
am highly dubious of this claim; you need information theory
<br>
which is relevant in defining the goals and feasibility of
<br>
signal processing, but I do not see the relevance of either
<br>
of these to the design of a rational inference substrate.
<br>
I can see why you'd think you needed them, if you thought
<br>
that connectionism and emergence were a good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Control theory by itself is not going to make an AGI, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control theory techniques may well be applied to the cyclic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or chaotic attractors stored in memory in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stabilize them, to make use of them as a pattern generator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to structure movement OR &quot;thought&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, so we have at least two people sharing this view,
<br>
possibly more if the AAII people are taking this view of
<br>
pattern processing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The only paper I can think of off hand that makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; semi-reasonable case for dynamic systems theory as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; basis for AGI is 'Dynamics and Cognition' by Timothy van
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Gelder. And he didn't have any good reasons why one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; /want/ to use that as a basis for AGI design, only some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; vague arguments as to why it should be possible and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it might be useful for analysing the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I don't understand the phrase, &quot;the basis for AGI&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nothing from any of these communities would be &quot;the basis&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>The paper I mentioned describes an architecture in which
<br>
dynamic systems theory is the most important descriptive and
<br>
predictive design tool, to the extent that I'd call it the
<br>
'basis'. Clearly you would not go as far in simplification,
<br>
but in my view you have inverted the sensible layering of
<br>
complexity as well as introducing some pointless and poorly
<br>
understood holdovers from human cognitive design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have evidence that, at least in some cases, brains use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractors, possibly chaotic ones, as memory elements.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. I've read plenty of papers on the subject. We can
<br>
do better. That's not even a statement of hubris, because
<br>
the task of designing an AGI to run on a (pretty good and
<br>
fast approximation of a) Turing machine is much easier,
<br>
in the absolute sense, than designing one to run on mammal
<br>
neurons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AS WELL AS fuzzy operators to work on those representations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to have flexible categorization, analogical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning, metaphor, creativity, etc.
</em><br>
<p>I do agree that you need fuzzy logic to do those things (it
<br>
is, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, necessary
<br>
but not sufficient). Fuzzy logic is of course a subset of
<br>
Bayesian/probabilistic reasoning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In addition, the time aspect of representation and action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very poorly accounted-for by non-dynamical approaches.
</em><br>
<p>Classically, this has been true, and this is an argument
<br>
for making very sure that dynamic analysis is efficient and
<br>
easily available within the AGI. But again, it's a technique
<br>
that a rational reasoner can use where appropriate, not a
<br>
technique you need to design a rational reasoner per se.
