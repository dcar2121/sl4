<p>If you're using variables that have insufficient dynamic range to
<br>
encompass the entire co-ordinate space, then by definition you
<br>
must be using some kind of system for nesting reference frames.
<br>
If you're using true absolute co-ordinates, i.e. every particle
<br>
or similar ontological primitive has a position in quanta relative
<br>
to the universe itself, then your variables must have enough
<br>
range to allow speeds from 1 distance quanta/time quanta up to
<br>
1 universe diameter/time quanta without any loss of precision.
<br>
Fractional speeds imply that the effects of momentum are
<br>
probabilistic if you are using an integrative model; they may
<br>
remain deterministic if you are using a continuous model.
<br>
Continuous models are more complicated but for relatively sparse
<br>
universes (and our universe is very sparse) they are much more
<br>
computationally efficient as well as being deterministic
<br>
(requiring no external source of randomness).
<br>
<p>If storage space and computing time aren't an issue, using
<br>
solely absolute co-ordinates is certainly much simpler. That
<br>
said note that the difference between representing co-ords in
<br>
our universe absolutely using (say) 256-bit integers and
<br>
32-bit floats you seem to be using is less than an order of
<br>
magnitude, which is pretty insignificent when you start
<br>
talking about the amount of computing power needed to run a
<br>
direct physical simulation of everything that exists. But anyway,
<br>
even if nested reference frames are used, this still isn't an
<br>
argument for relativity; indeed relativity is still a massive
<br>
complication to the calculation of any interactions, plus you
<br>
either have issues with rounding mismatched clocks to time
<br>
quanta or you have to abandon the notion of global instantaneous
<br>
states entirely, which is another major complication. If
<br>
relativity really did simplify anything, all non-trivial physical
<br>
simulation programs would be using it, whereas of course in
<br>
reality very few do.
