</em><br>
<p>I will argue that it has, but from a different viewpoint.
<br>
<p>I agree with you that the escape arguments given thus far are weak;
<br>
for the &quot;man versus dogs&quot; analogy to be even vaguely applicable, you'd
<br>
have to be talking about a naked man with no tools in a hermetically
<br>
sealed cell, in which case the dogs are right that he really can't
<br>
escape no matter how smart he is, no matter how many ways he can think
<br>
of to escape _if_ he had the means.
<br>
<p>The problem is that you can't have an AI in a box in the first place.
<br>
<p>For a start, a superintelligent being isn't going to run on a single
<br>
machine short of full nanotechnology. You'll have to have a _lot_ of
<br>
computers, connected by the highest speed network you can get, at
<br>
which point it isn't in a box anymore. And that's just the requirement
<br>
to _run_ a full-fledged AI, let alone _create_ one (which will require
<br>
far more resources).
<br>
<p>And then, nobody is actually going to put in all that work just to
<br>
spend two hours talking to the thing over an IRC link before turning
<br>
it off and reformatting the disks. To get any use out of it there'll
<br>
have to be rich two-way traffic, where you provide it with information
<br>
about the world and make use of advice and information it gives you. I
<br>
think we can all agree that in that situation, a superintelligent
<br>
entity could find ways to shaft you if it wanted to.
<br>
<p>So I will argue that there are no plausible assumptions in which the
<br>
strategy of &quot;create a superintelligent AI and keep it in a box&quot; is
<br>
safe _and_ useful _and_ feasible. Therefore, however confident you are
<br>
of your ability to keep a box sealed, it doesn't make sense to set out
<br>
to create a superintelligent AI unless you have a plan for making sure
<br>
it will be Friendly.
