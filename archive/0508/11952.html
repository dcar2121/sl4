</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;purely governed by its initial, hardwired motivations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are misunderstanding here. You *already have* desires to reform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself. Humans are inconsistent, with multiple sources of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation. You presumably love your son, and desire to be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person. These motivations come from a different source than your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporary limbic rage, and are unaffected in intensity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directionality. Hence, those motivations view anger as orthogonal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your goals of loving your son, and being a good person.
</em><br>
<p>No, once again, I protest that I am not underestimating the 
<br>
sophistication of the cognitive system.
<br>
<p>You are correct, I will grant you, that my example may simply be a case 
<br>
of one motivation system triumphing over another (love vs. limbic rage), 
<br>
but I would argue back to you that on this particular point we would 
<br>
have to come down to brass tacks and look into the design of the system 
<br>
to find out if the driver of my reformist tendency was that other 
<br>
motivation system, or something higher like self-knowledge.  You simply 
<br>
cannot assert that it is definitely and obviously a hard-wired 
<br>
motivation system that is doing it, without showing why it has to be so.
<br>
<p>But in that case my example was not good enough evidence.
<br>
<p>Here I will quickly try again, by way of your other comment:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Pure self-knowledge&quot; doesn't change anything about your total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations. You already wanted to be a more consistent person, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes revising some of your inconsistent, less powerful human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations. You'll notice, if you examine yourself carefully, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have little desire to reform your most important, cherished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs. This is probably not because they are objectively the best,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but rather because they are the things that are important to you, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprise central portions of your motivations.
</em><br>
<p>I will declare, here and now, that I just introspected, and you are 
<br>
mistaken (oops, I feel like we just went back to the age of the 
<br>
introspectionists.  gulp).
<br>
<p>Do I really have &quot;little desire to reform [my] most important, cherished 
<br>
beliefs&quot;?
<br>
<p>That is not so.  I happen to have some anti-desires (repugnances) that 
<br>
are quite strong.  I do not want to become a woman,  do not want to be 
<br>
gay (no disrespect to transgender/gay folks here:  just expressing my 
<br>
personal feelings about *my* lifestyle choices), and I am deeply 
<br>
repelled by drugs.
<br>
<p>Now, I know I *could* in some future world, flip a switch in such a way 
<br>
that I would enjoy being gay, or being a woman.  I know that after I 
<br>
flipped the switch, I would enjoy it deeply, even though the thought 
<br>
makes my skin crawl right now.
<br>
<p>Would I flip the switch?  I would be happy to do it.
<br>
<p>Now please explain which motivation system allowed me to make that choice?
<br>
<p>I made the choice, I claim, at a pure thought level.  I am not just a 
<br>
slave to the cruder parts of my motivation system.
<br>
<p>Or at least, if I cannot yet prove that it happened at a level above the 
<br>
slave-to-motivation level, can you convincing argue that it *could not* 
<br>
have originated at that higher level?
<br>
