<em>&gt; I agree with you in principle, but these things look less

</em><br>
<p>That's not at all what I meant.  I'm trying to figure out
<br>
the connection between control theory and signal
<br>
processing,
<br>
and peripheral vs. core complexity, and not getting it.
<br>
<p>Look at Chris Eliasmith's book, &quot;Neural engineering&quot;.
<br>
This is an excellent start on constructing modular systems
<br>
out of neural networks.  You can begin to see how you
<br>
might solve the 100-step problem, when you see how to
<br>
construct neural networks to implement each of those 100
<br>
steps, where each step is a signal processing step such as
<br>
performing a Fourier transform, or mapping deltas into
<br>
absolute values.
<br>
<p>(In its current incarnation, Neural Engineering
<br>
is at odds with dynamic systems theory approaches,
<br>
because of its modular nature.)
<br>
<p>Control theory by itself is not going to make an AGI, but
<br>
control theory techniques may well be applied to the cyclic
<br>
or chaotic attractors stored in memory in order to
<br>
stabilize them, to make use of them as a pattern generator
<br>
to structure movement OR &quot;thought&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only paper I can think of off hand that makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semi-reasonable case for dynamic systems theory as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basis for AGI is 'Dynamics and Cognition' by Timothy van
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gelder. And he didn't have any good reasons why one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; /want/ to use that as a basis for AGI design, only some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vague arguments as to why it should be possible and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might be useful for analysing the brain.
</em><br>
<p>Now I don't understand the phrase, &quot;the basis for AGI&quot;.
<br>
Nothing from any of these communities would be &quot;the basis&quot;.
<br>
You may have many necessary components, none of which
<br>
are &quot;the basis&quot;.
<br>
<p>We have evidence that, at least in some cases,
<br>
brains use attractors, possibly chaotic ones,
<br>
as memory elements.  This includes Freeman's work
<br>
studying the patterns present in olfactory cortex
<br>
on exposure to and while learning different smells.
<br>
It also includes the plots of human cyclical movements
<br>
as described in Kelso's work.  We have good theories as
<br>
to why this should be the case, including the properties
<br>
of switching dynamics (see my 1998 paper, Goetz and
<br>
Walters, &quot;The dynamics of recurrent behavior networks,&quot;
<br>
_Adaptive Behavior_ 6(2): 247-283), and the necessity of
<br>
having &quot;fuzzy&quot; (but not merely fuzzy-logic-like)
<br>
representations AS WELL AS fuzzy operators to work on those
<br>
representations, in order to have flexible categorization,
<br>
analogical reasoning, metaphor, creativity, etc.  In
<br>
addition, the time aspect of representation and action is
<br>
very poorly accounted-for by non-dynamical approaches.
<br>
One could fairly say it is ignored entirely, and that
<br>
experiments are structured to sidestep it.  There is a bit
<br>
on this in Jeff Hawkins' new book /On Intelligence/, IIRC.
