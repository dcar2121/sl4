I think this is a good time to identify what we mean by responsibility.
<br>
<p>In a neural network, we use back-propagation to assign &quot;blame&quot; for
<br>
errors to individual neurons. The purpose of this heuristic is to
<br>
determine which weights can be changed to reduce this error while
<br>
minimizing other disruptions which would be caused by this change. Human
<br>
responsibility is a similar concept.
<br>
<p>When Sam commits a crime, we do not blame Sam's grandmother. Sam's
<br>
grandmother giving birth to Sam's mother is part of the chain of
<br>
causality which led to the crime; without her, the crime could not have
<br>
occured. So why don't we blame her? We don't blame Sam's mother because
<br>
if we universally weaken the heuristics which led Sam to commit the
<br>
crime, then fewer crimes will be committed per person, but if we
<br>
universally weaken the heuristics which led Sam's grandmother to give
<br>
birth to Sam's mother, then all we accomplish is to reduce the world's
<br>
population.
<br>
<p>Note also that blame should not be assigned solely based on proximity to
<br>
the undesired event. If Sam pushes Bob off of a tall building, we do not
<br>
blame gravity for Bob's death, even though it was a more immediate cause
<br>
than Sam pushing Bob. Even if gravity had no other redeeming
<br>
characteristics, we still should not blame it, because our blaming
<br>
gravity has no bearing on what gravity will do. If we assign
<br>
responsibility to Sam, we can change the heuristics which led him to
<br>
push Bob, and fewer people will be pushed off of buildings. If we assign
<br>
responsibility to gravity, there's nothing we can do.
<br>
<p>In the case of the AI researcher... if a hypothetical AI researcher
<br>
creates a Seed AI which destroys humanity, who is responsible? If
<br>
society universally blames the hypothetical AI researcher, then maybe
<br>
actual AI researchers will listen and watch what they're doing. If
<br>
society universally blames the hypothetical Seed AI, then actual Seed
<br>
AIs will not care in the least bit.
