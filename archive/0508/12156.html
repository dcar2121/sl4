<br>
<em>&gt; The fundamental driving force behind emotional intelligence (as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it) is a desire to be happy.  &quot;Happiness&quot; in the case of AI is just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number, as are all emotions.  
</em><br>
<p>I have a fundamental disagreement here. Emotions are NOT numbers, they
<br>
should never be numbers even in a computer embodiment. Emotions change
<br>
the frames through which people see the world. Basically, a frame can
<br>
amplify, filter out, or distort elements of incoming and stored
<br>
information -- to streamline the process of recognition, analysis, and
<br>
planning of objects, events, attitudes, etc.
<br>
<p>When you are happy you &quot;see&quot; the world differently than you &quot;see&quot; the
<br>
world when you are &quot;upset&quot;. A different set of criterial frames act upon
<br>
one's perception and sequencing of the world depending upon the emotion
<br>
experienced. Fundamentally, emotions correspond to the activation of
<br>
certain frames; which people have given names to based upon the
<br>
similarity of the experience in the body and cognitive processing.
<br>
<p>What does it mean to be jealous if not to analyze a situation based upon
<br>
a frame of the absence of getting something that someone else is getting;
<br>
and your being more deserving of it; which presupposes a criteria of
<br>
deservingness; and the complex emotion of deservingness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a biological intelligence there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlation for emotions as simple vectors - it might, for example, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable to measure the fear level of a creature based upon the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of adrenaline in its system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The catch is, the system cannot make itself happy.  All of the input 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is given affects its emotional state - if it observes people who are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy, it becomes happy itself.  In essence, it is driven by a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make other people happy - or, to put that another way, it is driven 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;friendliness&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>A person can make themselves happy. Linking frames of happiness to
<br>
outside influences is not the only way to operate as a person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alongside basic happiness sit a number of other basic emotions - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anger, etc etc.  Again, each of these cannot be influenced directly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the being itself (at least not by conscious thought), they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled by external influences.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I fundamentally disagree. A person can &quot;go to a happy place&quot; in
<br>
their mind, such as when you remember the  fun of being a child chasing
<br>
your dog, and this need have nothing to do with &quot;external influences&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Above these primal emotions sit more complex emotions, such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidence, stubbornness, and optimism.  (There is a threshold at 
</em><br>
<p>Notice that optimism is a way of framing the future, of &quot;seeing&quot;,
<br>
&quot;feeling&quot;, and &quot;hearing&quot; (or valuing) more of the good and less of the
<br>
bad, that might be anticipated for the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   these should be regarded as personality traits, although that's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictly relevant).  Each of these more complex emotions has a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence on overall happiness, but at the same time are influenced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by external factors.  As a general rule, every emotion is controlled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two things - external influences, and other emotions.  Any emotion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a large effect on overall happiness is controlled more readily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external influences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example: Optimism is strongly affected by external influences.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Optimism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   controls how likely you are to take a chance - if the chance pays 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your optimism goes up, and you feel happier because of it.  At the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, stubbornness affects optimism, but does not directly affect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness much.  If you are stubborn in a given situation, you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to take a chance, and the happiness increase when that chance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeeds is far less.
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't stubbornness mean that once you take a position, you don't change
<br>
your position? This doesn't really have anything to do with whether or
<br>
not one is taking a chance with this position that has been selected,
<br>
does it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Memory is a combination of two things.  Firstly, a word - the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.  Secondly, attached to each word is a set of emotional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vectors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which comprise the beings total experience about that object or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   If the being encounters an object that it recognizes, it consults 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory to see how that object has made it feel in the past, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determines 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the emotions it presents are appropriate for its current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state, and either promotes or avoids the encounter accordingly.
</em><br>
<p>There is an automatic revivification, an unconscious framing of the
<br>
object in light of the frames and sequences-of-events-and-reactions
<br>
(templates) previously experienced. What happens is that a person
<br>
responds in a way that corresponds to the appropriate or familiar
<br>
response as determined by prior interaction with an object of the same
<br>
type. In a sense they are not acting in the present, they are acting in
<br>
the past, and may ignore, due to framing that de-emphasizes them,
<br>
elements that make the current situation different from the prior
<br>
situation; as well as seeing features that are not as prominent
<br>
(sometimes totally absent) in the current object -- as if they were as
<br>
prominent as the features in the previous, remembered object.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example:  Let's say that in the past, you have been bitten by a dog. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pain is a universal way to reduce happiness (much like pleasure is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal way to increase it), so the emotional vectors associated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your memory of a dog include negative happiness.  However, if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person holding a dog and you remember that the person has, in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made you very happy, you may still decide that the dog is not worth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding; the negative happiness based upon your experiences with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are offset by the positive happiness of your experiences with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, and you can make an intelligent decision on how to respond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the situation.
</em><br>
<p>Emotional response is not &quot;intelligent&quot;; it relies on unconscious framing
<br>
of the situation which may distort the actual circumstance a person can
<br>
find yourself in .. a memory that overrides the actuality-set of
<br>
features.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Automated learning, in any given situation, is simply the product of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combining a number of different emotional memories together in order 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve the required goal.  You program the system with a number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic operations that could be applied to the task, and let the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment randomly, learning based upon emotion along the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, for example, correctly recognizing a face stimulates &quot;pleasure&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (either by seeing that the face is smiling, or by the programmer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressing the &quot;pleasure&quot; button), then whatever operations were used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform that recognition (adjust brightness, decrease color depth, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjust contrast, etc etc) are then given higher happiness ratings, 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the adjustment of brightness, etc. corresponds to framing. It may
<br>
also cause a misrecognition when the same framing is applied to a face in
<br>
the future. However, I disagree with the happiness conditioning you are
<br>
suggesting. There are intrinsic features of happiness that affect
<br>
cognitive processing; in general, when one is happy, cognitive processing
<br>
&quot;flows&quot;, there is more automatic unconscious processing, and less
<br>
conscious analysis going on; although, this could be said for many
<br>
emotions. You have positive thoughts that spring to mind from the
<br>
unconscious, &quot;these people will like you&quot;, &quot;you are doing great&quot;, &quot;this
<br>
is getting you somewhere&quot;, etc. that maintain the frame, that are related
<br>
to prior experience of feeling good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more likely to be used again.  The act of randomly combining 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operations together is based upon emotion, and the success or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failure of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each attempt is similarly stored as emotion.  If, for example, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer takes a chance on a new graphics operation when attempting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognition, it will remember whether it tried it before and failed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based upon the stored value for confidence; if its confidence is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that time then it may still take a chance on it.
</em><br>
<p>Situational confidence may override remembered failure; but what makes
<br>
this intelligent?
<br>
<p>I'm interested in your responses.
