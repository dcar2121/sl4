I'm sorry, I must be on the wrong list.  I was looking for the list where 
<br>
people discussed the nature, impact, and design strategy for survivable 
<br>
recusively self-improving generally intelligent systems.  You know, stuff 
<br>
that Extropians and Transhumanists can't really think about clearly because 
<br>
they are still in a state of shock.  Seems to me that nukes are more like 
<br>
SL0, as a general understanding of what they are and of their consequences 
<br>
is expected of ordinary elected officials and the like.  I think that &quot;nukes 
<br>
and ultimately annihilation or transcendence as a part of the human extended 
<br>
phenotype&quot;, which initially started this thread, is probably SL3 at best, 
<br>
but opportunities for Eli to reaffirm his dedication to human survival 
<br>
through the use of dramatic support, so long as they work (e.g. help him to 
<br>
maintain a productive mental state) are, if not SL4 ideas, at least SL4 
<br>
appropriate uses of resources, at least so long as they don't provide more 
<br>
motivational assistance to the would be creators of UFAI, who can see 
<br>
dramatic support for their role as agents in our collective suicide as an 
<br>
inevitable consequence of our nature.
<br>
It's probably a waste of time to let such utilization of bandwidth for drama 
<br>
distract us by spawning threads though.  That way leads to madness, e.g. 
<br>
politics
