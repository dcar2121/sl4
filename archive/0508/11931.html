<em>&gt; No, not at all!  I am saying that a sufficiently smart mind would

</em><br>
<em>&gt; system comprising two things:  a motivational system whose structure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determines what gives it pleasure, and an intelligence system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I think that what you yourself have done is to hit up against the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropomorphization problem, thus:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; A Seed AI which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; believes its goal to be paper clip maximization will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait!  why would it be so impoverished in its understanding of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation systems, that it just &quot;believes its goal to do [x]&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confuses this with the last word on what pushes its buttons?  Would it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have a much deeper understanding, and say &quot;I feel this urge to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paperclipize, but I know it's just a quirk of my motivation system, so, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's see, is this sensible?  Do I have any other choices here?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But why specifically would it for some reason use that understanding to override 
<br>
it's goal system in such a way?
<br>
<p>This seems the crux of the matter, and where I think there is indeed some 
<br>
anthropomorphizing going on with your hypothesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you assume that it only has the not-very-introspective human-level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of its motivation, then this is anthropomorphism, surely? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (It's a bit of a turnabout, for sure, since anthropomorphism usually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means accidentally assuming too much intelligence in an inanimate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object, whereas here we got caught assuming too little in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence!)
</em><br>
<p>Here you are incorrect because virtually everyone on this list assumes as a 
<br>
given that a superintelligence will indeed have full access to, and likely full 
<br>
understanding of, its own &quot;mind code&quot;.
<br>
<p>But again, having such access and understanding does not automatically and 
<br>
arbitrarily lead to a particular desire to reform the mind in any specific way. 
<br>
&quot;Desires&quot; are driven from a specific goal system. As the previous poster 
<br>
suggested, if the goal system is so simplistic as to only purely want to create 
<br>
paperclips, where _specifically_ does it happen in the flow of this particular 
<br>
AGI's software processes that it up and decides to override that goal? It simply 
<br>
won't, because that isn't what it wants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To illustrate:  I don't &quot;believe my goal is to have wild sex.&quot;  I just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jolly well *like* doing it!  Moreover, I'm sophisticated enough to know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have a quirky little motivation system down there in my brain, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it is modifiable (though not by me, not yet).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bottom Line:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is all about there being a threshold level of understanding of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation systems, coupled with the ability to flip switches in ones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own system, above which the mind will behave very, very differently than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your standard model human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm just not seeing how that will work. It sounds very similar to how Eliezer 
<br>
and I first imagined things might magically work back in 1999, but after taking 
<br>
the time to actually try and work out exactly how real AGI software might behave 
<br>
it just didn't fall out of the system. It's something that will have to very 
<br>
carefully be worked out and designed into the system in very specific ways, and 
<br>
a system without such a design will not as far as we can see automatically 
<br>
behave in that manner.
