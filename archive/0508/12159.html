<p>
This concern has been discussed under the topic &quot;subgoal stomp&quot; for a long 
<br>
time here.  To some degree the phenomenon of subgoal stomp arises from the 
<br>
interaction of shallow analysis on the AI's part, and to some degree from 
<br>
the lack of clear preference ordering.  Humans analyze extremely shallowly, 
<br>
and have disturbingly unclear preference ordering, so they can imagine 
<br>
making such transitions.  However, even in the case of humans, it is not 
<br>
clear that they every actually do make such transitions after reaching 
<br>
adulthood.  I suspect that any time in which we come close to such 
<br>
transitions, our doing so is driven by the influence of a well evolved meme 
<br>
complex or of another person engineering or preferences as a subgoal for the 
<br>
satisfaction of their own preferences.  None of these circumstances resemble 
<br>
the likely environment of a transparently and rationally designed AI.  Even 
<br>
in the abstract, such scenarios appear implausible.  Drives in a human mind 
<br>
may be agent-like and &quot;conspire&quot;.  Criteria in an optimization do not do 
<br>
this.  Three discrete top-level goals might easily interact in such a manner 
<br>
as to alter or remove one-another, but they should not ever generate novel 
<br>
top-level goals, only sub-goals.  They should only produce sub-goals which 
<br>
would contribute to supergoal fulfillment, not arbitrary subgoals.
<br>
<p>I would not be very concerned by such issues unless I was shown a 
<br>
non-abstract example.  An existance proof that the specific type of 
<br>
intelligence displayed by humans might undergo such a goal transition would 
<br>
count.  Furthermore, the example should not involve the manipulation of 
<br>
comparable intelligences, penetration of feeble defenses by meme complexes, 
<br>
disordered preferences or gross failures of foresight.
<br>
<p>Human preferences for fertility correlates are not tightly integrated with 
<br>
other preferences.  Furthermore, such preferences are almost completly 
<br>
disconnected from the verbal manipulations within which preferences are 
<br>
formalized.  The agent &quot;Phil Goetz&quot; which behaves most like a utility 
<br>
function is the relatively serial and verbal meme-complex which has 
<br>
essentially taken over a messy evolved adaptation executor.  The verbal 
<br>
structure of the statement &quot;I was thinking how much easier my life would be&quot; 
<br>
suggests that this meme complex values &quot;ease&quot;, though possibly only as a low 
<br>
level goal.  The meme complex in question contains certain preferences which 
<br>
refer to the evolved preferences of the adaptation executor, such as a 
<br>
preference for breast and waist size, but these preferences are relatively 
<br>
low priority sub-goals.  In so far as the meme complex is a semantic web, it 
<br>
cannot even directly interface with the perceptions which it is referring 
<br>
to, and in so far as it lacks external reference semantics it doesn't care 
<br>
about the referrent, only about its input stream.
<br>
<p>The unsurprising and correct conclusion to draw from your unrealized 
<br>
meta-preferences is that humans are not Friendly.  Evolution did not create 
<br>
adaptation executors with pre-adapted mental facilities for strong self 
<br>
modification during hard take-off scenarios.  For this reason, efforts to 
<br>
construct sentient software modeled on the human mind are extremely unwise, 
<br>
though not quite as certainly suicidal as some other proposals.  This topic 
<br>
and others are covered rather well in Coding a Friendly AI.  There have been 
<br>
subsequent advances in Friendlyness theory, but this document is the basic 
<br>
introductory text.  It is extremely unlikely that someone who doesn't 
<br>
understand it will be prepared to contribute insights into AI safety.
