Both here and at crnano's blog it seems to me that ego is impairing 
<br>
efficient use of time and possibly efficient acquisition of information.  
<br>
When someone who has ignored the rules, not read enough back posts, and who 
<br>
is generally clueless shows up making cliche errors, people argue, refute, 
<br>
and spend a great deal of time correcting the inconsiderate time waster.  
<br>
Even trolls are often allowed to post a few dozen times.  By contrast, when 
<br>
similar or more subtle errors are made by actual experts, or by those who 
<br>
with some reason claim expertise, hostility becomes far more overt and 
<br>
attempts are made to drive the know-it-all away.  This is unfortunate, both 
<br>
because it is likely to impede the efficient flow of information, and 
<br>
because it prevents us from developing the habits necessary to acqurie 
<br>
buy-in from people who are not yet familiar with our positions but who have 
<br>
demonstrated the willingness to study and learn something, and who may know 
<br>
where to find other people who could provide assistance or money.
<br>
Richard Loosemore provides a particularly clear example of this problem.  
<br>
When Richard started posting, it was clear that he didn't know SL4 concepts 
<br>
remotely well enough to judge them or contribute to them.  It was not clear 
<br>
that he did know anything else.  People on the list responded by arguing 
<br>
politely, explaining points, and in general treating him in a friendly 
<br>
fasion.  Then, when he asserted his erudition (and Bayesians should have 
<br>
outgrown absolute objections to arguments from authority) suddenly people  
<br>
became aggressive about putting him in his place.
<br>
I am a firm believer of putting people in their place.  It avoids much 
<br>
wasted time AND greatly increases the degree of respect that you will 
<br>
recieve from the truly ignorant.  It is much more likely that the uninformed 
<br>
will actually read the articles that you tell them to if you are 
<br>
condescending or dictatorial about it.  However, the older and more 
<br>
knowledgable someone is, the less likely this strategy is to be productive.  
<br>
When experts or near experts have read your introductory writings and have 
<br>
gotten key points grossly wrong without realizing it, this means that you 
<br>
have a chance to gain skills that will be vitally important when it comes 
<br>
time to approach other experts who haven't even read your introductory 
<br>
writings.  It is precisely the experts who most need outreach, as these are 
<br>
the people most likely to actually help if you can get through to them.
