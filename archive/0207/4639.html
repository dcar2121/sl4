</em><br>
<p>When I was very *very* young, I think around age six or seven, I read a
<br>
children's book whose name I have long since forgotten.  I do remember 
<br>
one thought from that book, though, and it has served me in good stead 
<br>
my whole life:
<br>
<p>&quot;There's a difference between believing in ghosts and half-believing. 
<br>
Some people say they don't believe in ghosts, but they still jump at odd 
<br>
noises and feel uncomfortable when ghost stories are told.&quot;
<br>
<p>At the age of thirteen or thereabouts I read &quot;Snow Crash&quot; by Neal 
<br>
Stephenson, during which Stephenson mentions in passing the debate about 
<br>
which authors wrote the book of Deuteronomy, which was written somewhat 
<br>
later than the other four chapters of the Old Testament.  And when I 
<br>
read this it came as a very slight shock, because I realized that up 
<br>
until that point I'd been thinking, somewhere in the back of my mind, 
<br>
&quot;Moses made the whole thing up on Mount Sinai&quot;, rather than &quot;This is a 
<br>
perfectly ordinary document produced in a perfectly ordinary way.&quot;  And 
<br>
when that one last shock had passed, the separation was complete.
<br>
<p>If you're thinking &quot;Jesus was just a good man&quot;, without realizing how 
<br>
religiously brainwashed this sounds to someone who was raised without 
<br>
any mention of Jesus at all, it sounds to me like you still 
<br>
half-believe.  I suggest you check out some reputable material on the 
<br>
actual authors and derivation of the New Testament.
<br>
<p>If you're going to quote someone, don't quote a religious figure, even 
<br>
with a disclaimer.  Find a modern secular humanist who has said roughly 
<br>
the same thing; s/he will undoubtedly have said it far more clearly and 
<br>
with fewer millennia-old prejudices mixed in.
