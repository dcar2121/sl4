<p>That's another good possibility.  There are plenty of reasons why one or 
<br>
more Singularities could have even successfully occurred and us not be 
<br>
aware of them.  Maybe one occurred and the resulting Singularity spread 
<br>
throughout the universe, except where Intelligent life had/was forming (due 
<br>
to friendliness).    Thus we're just an oasis of natural evolution and 
<br>
if/when we get to a Singularity ourselves we'll just be invited to join the 
<br>
party already in progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Even if we don't get a Singularity this will be true.  Widespread 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;availability of nano-technology will make the industrial base completely 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;information.  Some level of service organizations may survive depending 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you think maybe the powers that be saw this possibility and wrecked the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tech sector on purpose to slow it down until they could maybe put more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;controls in?  Naw, probably simple stupidity is enough of an explanation.
</em><br>
<p>Good question, I never considered that.  It seems to me that Alan Greenspan 
<br>
(and the other members of the board) are almost solely responsible for this 
<br>
recession.  Under normal circumstances I'd rule out the 
<br>
possibility.  However, given that this recession had a pretty specific 
<br>
catalyst it is a possibility.  I think its unlikely that its due to 
<br>
nano-tech or AI, though.  Maybe someone just has an issue with very rapid 
<br>
technical progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I'm not at all convinced that a good outcome is likely (I suspect the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;opposite is true).  However, I don't see that humanity has much choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The nature of man is such that we will continue to progress.  Even if all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technology was destroyed today humans will either eventually reach the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;point of no return or will be destroyed by other means.  I am hopeful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that everything will turn out ok, though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, we have all the choice that there is right now.  If we believe that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the basic nature of ourselves leads to a not good outcome then we have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choice but to do all we can to change or transcend some of that nature or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ameliorate its effects to increase the probability of a good outcome.  Or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;create something more powerful than us that has our best interest in mind, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a FAI.
</em><br>
<p>I don't necessarily think its the nature of ourselves that leads to 
<br>
not-good outcome, I think its just a vastly, incredibly difficult 
<br>
problem.  There are (as is usually the case) many more ways to fail than 
<br>
succeed and this problem in particular transcends human intelligence so it 
<br>
would stand to reason that there is a higher chance of failure than 
<br>
success.  I don't like this, but I can't see where our primitive minds can 
<br>
do any better.  We must, of course, try our best.
