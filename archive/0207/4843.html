Another thing we need to clarify about this drive is the goal.  Is it merely intelligence and power?  I think we can get an idea of the goal by looking at what we are.  We are all familiar with the arguments related to identity and body.  If I cut off my hand I am still me, still just as much me as before.  I may have less capability in this environment but I am not less me.  I think the same can be said of mental appendages, memories.  I can remember the address of the house I grew up in but if I forgot I would not have lost any of the real me, just a possession.  If I forgot how to get home from work today I would have lost some capability to operate in this environment but not any of my identity.  On the other hand if I forgot my abstracted concept of love then I would have lost some of my identity, would be less of the me.  I am a network of interrelated abstracted concepts applicable over a broad range of environments.  I am information.  I can be copied, multiplied, stored, evolved, or fractured.  In as much as these concepts are shared by other instantiations I am not an individual.  I think the goal is the evolution of these concepts, not strictly limited to intelligence.
