Follow up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From GISAI (<a href="http://intelligence.org/GISAI.html#mind_thought_I">http://intelligence.org/GISAI.html#mind_thought_I</a> ):
</em><br>
ESY&gt; But to say that &quot;Aisa understands Aisa&quot; is not the same as saying
<br>
ESY&gt; &quot;Aisa understands itself&quot;.  Douglas Lenat once said of Cyc that it
<br>
ESY&gt; knows that there is such a thing as Cyc, and it knows that Cyc is
<br>
ESY&gt; a computer, but it doesn't know that it is Cyc.  That is the key
<br>
ESY&gt; distinction.  A thought-level SPDM binding for the self-model is
<br>
ESY&gt; more than enough to let Aisa legitimately say &quot;Aisa wants ice
<br>
ESY&gt; cream&quot; - to make use of the term &quot;Aisa&quot; materially different from
<br>
ESY&gt; use of the term &quot;shmeerp&quot; or &quot;G0025&quot;.  There's still one more step
<br>
ESY&gt; required before Aisa can say:  &quot;I want ice cream.&quot;  But what?
<br>
ESY&gt;
<br>
ESY&gt; Interestingly, assuming the problem is real is enough to solve the
<br>
ESY&gt; problem.  If another step is required before Aisa can say &quot;I want
<br>
ESY&gt; ice cream&quot;, then there must be a material difference between
<br>
ESY&gt; saying &quot;Aisa wants ice cream&quot; and &quot;I want ice cream&quot;.  So that's
<br>
ESY&gt; the answer:  You can say &quot;I&quot; when the behavior generated by
<br>
ESY&gt; modeling yourself is materially different - because of the self-
<br>
ESY&gt; reference - from the behavior that would be generated by modeling
<br>
ESY&gt; another AI that happened to look like yourself.
<br>
ESY&gt;
<br>
ESY&gt; This will never happen with any individual thought - not in humans,
<br>
ESY&gt; not in AIs - but iterated versions of Aisa-referential thoughts may
<br>
ESY&gt; begin to exhibit materially different behavior.  Any individual
<br>
ESY&gt; thought will always be a case of A modifying B, but if B then goes
<br>
ESY&gt; on to modify A, the system-as-a-whole may exhibit behavior that is
<br>
ESY&gt; fundamentally characteristic of self-awareness.  And then Aisa can
<br>
ESY&gt; legitimately say of verself:  &quot;I want an ice-cream cone.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think the above could form the basis for a good argument that
<br>
in order to reach a certain level of intelligence, awareness is
<br>
_required_.  Specifically, without the ability to create complicated
<br>
feedback loops which in turn mean the system-as-a-whole exhibits
<br>
self-awareness, intelligence cannot come about.
<br>
<p>Whether through interacting with the real world or internal models
<br>
exhibiting sufficient levels of complexity, an AI *must* IMO be able
<br>
to create feedback systems in order to learn/figure things out, i.e.
<br>
in order for us to consider it intelligent.  And once you reach a
<br>
certain level of complexity, IMO self-awareness is as inevitable as
<br>
the Singularity.
