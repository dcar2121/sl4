</em><br>
<p>James, I never, ever, ever suggested explicitly programming in the Sysop 
<br>
Scenario.  I thought (and still think) that imagining an FAI having to 
<br>
serve as the OS of a universe provides an extreme way to test your 
<br>
conception of morality - it's a more stringent test than we apply to the 
<br>
morals that humans use to interact with each other.  But that wasn't 
<br>
originally the rationale of talking about the Sysop Scenario.  The point 
<br>
of the Sysop Scenario is that it provides a concrete disproof of these 
<br>
three claims:
<br>
<p>1)  It is knowably the case that as intelligence and technological 
<br>
ability increases, the ability of attackers to wreak asymmetrical havoc 
<br>
on defenders goes on increasing indefinitely.  Therefore we should 
<br>
attempt to halt progress because existential risk is a monotonically 
<br>
increasing function of progress, and a Singularity would inevitably 
<br>
destroy the world by giving trillions of individuals the independent 
<br>
ability to do so.  There is no conceivable way to avoid this outcome. 
<br>
Therefore the Singularity should be avoided or delayed as long as possible.
<br>
<p>2)  Although not actually resulting in the destruction of all 
<br>
intelligent life, a Singularity will result in a colonization wave of 
<br>
entities attempting to grab all resources in the universe.  The threat 
<br>
of instant destruction on any lapse of vigilance will force all 
<br>
posthuman communities to live in fear of one another, and Darwinian 
<br>
competition will eliminate all entities with goals that we would regard 
<br>
as sympathetic, leaving no computing power for activities we would 
<br>
regard as meaningful.  There is no conceivable way to avoid this 
<br>
outcome.  Therefore the Singularity should be avoided or delayed as long 
<br>
as possible.
<br>
<p>3)  Creating a Singularity will not actually alleviate misery; billions 
<br>
of posthumans will simulate countless quadrillions of human-level 
<br>
sentient beings; and while some of them might live in worlds pleasanter 
<br>
than this one, quadrillions more would live in worlds as bad as this one 
<br>
or worse.  There is no conceivable way to avoid this outcome.  Therefore 
<br>
the Singularity should be avoided or delayed as long as possible.
<br>
<p>The Sysop Scenario is not the only possible solution to any of these 
<br>
three problems.  It just demonstrates that at least one humanly 
<br>
conceivable solution exists.
<br>
<p>But apparently rational discussion of the Sysop Scenario just isn't 
<br>
possible, even on the SL4 mailing list.
