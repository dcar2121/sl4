<p>
I conducted my own survey in an Evangelical IRC channel I lurk in from time
<br>
to time. The general consensus seeme to be that a mind without faith would
<br>
not be able to reason itself to an understanding of the correctness of their
<br>
faith, even if it posessed no pride. They seemed to feel very strongly that
<br>
some form of  supernatural intervention on the part of God is necessary for
<br>
a mind to see the truth of their brand of Christianity. Their greatest
<br>
concern at first was whether such a mind would be affected by sin, but it
<br>
seemed that, either way, the AI would not be able to access the truth by
<br>
purely evidenciary means.
<br>
<p>Here follows a log of their responses:
<br>
[I am HeatDeath in this log.]
<br>
=======================================
<br>
* mfibaway examines the corrupted mind that formulates such questions ;)
<br>
<p>&lt;js4jc&gt; What does it matter? According to you all will be saved....
<br>
&lt;HeatDeath&gt; js4jc: I believe that. But that doesn't answer the question.
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; the question has mainly to do with the accessibility of
<br>
metaphysical truths to the intellect.
<br>
<p>&lt;vividblue&gt; heat no
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: um well it depends on how much info and what info he was
<br>
getting
<br>
* js4jc starts typing, realizes she's just too beat to bother, and allows
<br>
someone else to tackle this one...
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; lol
<br>
&lt;HeatDeath&gt; oso: assume the mind has access to the real world to any desired
<br>
resolution, and the ability to read human minds.
<br>
&lt;vividblue&gt; I dont think Catholocism is predestinarian
<br>
<p>&lt;vividblue&gt; Therefore it fails in that regard
<br>
&lt;mfibaway&gt; HeatDeath, Scripture teaches that the mind is debased and
<br>
corrupted by the affects of sin through Adam's fall ....
<br>
&lt;Micah&gt; vivid: you've not talked to aquianian or augustinian catholics then
<br>
<p>&lt;mfibaway&gt; your postulate is a waste of time since it creates its own
<br>
problems and then seeks to solve them
<br>
&lt;mfibaway&gt; we can only go by what IS true and objective
<br>
&lt;vividblue&gt; Micah do they assert that it is predestinarian?
<br>
&lt;mfibaway&gt; not by what we invent to be reality
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: i would have to say no then
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: is this mind affected by sin?
<br>
&lt;HeatDeath&gt; oso: it might be, and it might not be.
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; is that the only determining factor?
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: no but it will effect the outcome
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; oso: If we assume the mind is affected by sin, can it?
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: because he will have the same prob as we have in dealing
<br>
with presuppositions
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: it's possible
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; And if we assume the mind is not affected by sin...?
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: i would think so
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; oso: just to clarify, what problems do we have in dealing with
<br>
presuppositions?
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: well, sometimes when we get to a verse we say &quot;that is not
<br>
what that means&quot; even though that is what it means. Because we read the
<br>
bible with already assumed outcomes
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; or presuppositions
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; everyone has them
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; So you feel that a mind that is affected by sin might not be
<br>
able to determine the true denomination by examination if it has
<br>
presuppositions?
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; yep
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; traditions effect us as well
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; traditions effect us as well
<br>
* Micah notes that scripture states that the mind affected by sin (and
<br>
unregenerated) cannot understand the Spiritual things of God. (1 Cor. 2:14)
<br>
<p>&lt;Micah&gt; and thus, still subject to error
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; Micah: would it be fair to say then that a mind affected by sin,
<br>
no matter how great it's ability to examine the real world and the minds of
<br>
men, would be able to come to no more certainty regarding the truth of a
<br>
particular denomination than any normal human?
<br>
<p>&lt;Micah&gt; heat: depends are we talking spiritual regenerate or not?
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; I'm not familiar with the term &quot;spiritual regenerate&quot;. We're
<br>
taking about an extremely intelligent mind, not necessarily a human mind,
<br>
that has no pride but also no faith.
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: well i think the extent of adams sin was universal so even
<br>
the creature would be affected
<br>
<p>&lt;Micah&gt; heat: so we are talking about a mind unaltered by God. While such a
<br>
mind might be able to see inconsistancies in certain concepts it would not
<br>
fully comprehend the truth and be able to judge accordingly.
<br>
<p>&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: it's not  the intellegence that is the final outcome, its
<br>
sin
<br>
<p>&lt;Micah&gt; Heat: I also believe that no mind in such a state is truly &quot;without
<br>
pride&quot;. Pride is arguably the first sin.
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; Micah: interesting.
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; heat: for instance i am never wrong but  sin keeps everyone from
<br>
seeing this. :)
<br>
&lt;Micah&gt; oso: LOL!  Liar and a thief you are!@
<br>
&lt;Micah&gt; :)
<br>
<p>&lt;HeatDeath&gt; Micah, oso: Do you feel that such a mind could come to a
<br>
rational, or even a probabilistic, conclusion that the one true denomination
<br>
WAS the one true denomination, even if it had no spiritual capacity to
<br>
become a worshipping member?
<br>
<p>&lt;Micah&gt; Heat: nope.
<br>
&lt;osoclasi&gt; no
<br>
