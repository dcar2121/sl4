<p>CS&gt;&gt; So you claim.  I beg to differ. If your simulation, or whatever, is
<br>
CS&gt;&gt; based on physics, and if even a single atom can be in an infinity of
<br>
CS&gt;&gt; states (positions, electron spin, whatever degrees of freedom quarks
<br>
<p>TK&gt; For the first aid - it is definitly not so. And for the medicine as
<br>
TK&gt; well, also not. The latest should be bigger, yes. Still very finite.
<br>
<p>Again...so you say.  Do you have any argument for this?  Isn't there
<br>
an infinity of states even one atom or molecule can be in, let alone
<br>
the number that make up a human body?
<br>
<p>CS&gt;&gt; could still be NP-hard.  
<br>
<p>TK&gt; It's not.
<br>
<p>How do you know?
<br>
<p>CS&gt;&gt; I think you're overconfident of the ability of standard
<br>
CS&gt;&gt; computational techniques to solve problems.
<br>
<p>TK&gt; That is my point. You can do GA with them - can't you? Just see,
<br>
TK&gt; what the evolution is capable of.  Needs a lot of computation -
<br>
TK&gt; but so what, if you have it? 
<br>
<p>OK. But how do you get massive amounts of computation in our lifetime?
<br>
By building a seed AI, which can learn, and grow, until it can design
<br>
new versions of itself, and new hardware to run them on.  At that
<br>
point, building a non-conscious AI (which I don't think is possible,
<br>
for reasons I've outlined in other posts) becomes irrelevant.
<br>
<p>In any case: talk is cheap, code is hard.  You say x, y and z is
<br>
possible?  Fine, I don't think it is.  Now write the software and
<br>
prove me wrong.
<br>
<p>If we were sitting around wondering how to get rich, and I said
<br>
&quot;I know!  Let's become famous rockstars!&quot; -- that wouldn't be very
<br>
helpful, you know?
<br>
<p>...or wait, I've got it!  You're somebody's early prototype, aren't
<br>
you?  You can tell me, it's OK...Cyc, maybe?
<br>
<p>I'm definitely getting that expert system, &quot;symbolic manipulation
<br>
without meaningful underlying structures&quot; vibe...
