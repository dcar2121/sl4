<p>
I wonder if in these discussions of intelligence vs. wisdom, we're not
<br>
leaving out an essential component of the distinction: namely, human
<br>
psychology with its conscious vs. subconscious, id/ego/superego,
<br>
shadows, complexes, anima and all the rest of it.
<br>
<p>Perhaps when we say of someone that they're intelligent but not (yet)
<br>
wise we really are referring to a lack of congruence between their
<br>
explicit stated goals and their &quot;actual&quot; (subconscious) goals, as
<br>
evidenced by their behaviour.  I put &quot;actual&quot; between quotes because
<br>
the situation is of course far more complex than that.
<br>
<p>Question: would you predict that an AI at some point during its
<br>
moral evolution will 'have' some similar substrate for internal
<br>
struggle?  I am presuming most expect a super AI to be perfectly
<br>
congruent*, with no internal contradictions, but am asking a question
<br>
about how it gets to that point.
<br>
<p>* Actually, I'm starting to strongly question this myself.  Even in a
<br>
system as simple as Hofstadter's CopyCat, one can point to conflicting
<br>
drives, drives at different levels of abstraction, etc.  There appear,
<br>
to me, to be fundamental reasons why self-consciousness of necessity
<br>
cannot include the whole system.  Taken together, this would appear to
<br>
imply at the least a differentiated 'ego' with some underlying less
<br>
consciously accessible (or at least, accessed) motivations, and
<br>
possibly a differentiated 'subconscious' as well.
