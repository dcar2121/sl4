<p>Well, I guess that depends upon the topic.  When it comes to wisdom in
<br>
regard to human interactions you can learn some by thinking and some by
<br>
reading but most has to be leared by experience.
<br>
<p>If your talking about mathematics then you can become mathamatially wise
<br>
by just doing a whole lot of thinking.
<br>
<p>For decisions about The Singularity in regard to how it *should* impact
<br>
humanity I believe the &quot;soft&quot; skills are key, and most of that knowledge
<br>
needs to come from the &quot;I've been around the world and back again&quot; category.
<br>
<p>Thinking rationally gets you far on technical points on Friendliness
<br>
implementations, architecture, etc.  But doesn't buy you nearly as much
<br>
on how to apply a Singularity to a civilization.  Because to truly
<br>
understand, respect and have empathy for all humans requires being
<br>
exposed to large quantities of them from different backgrounds and
<br>
taking a real interest in getting to know them.
<br>
<p>So, back to the point, the importance of time varies with the subject
<br>
matter.  I was thinking in context of soft skills.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; formulate a negative to that which is right.  The `easy' way (this kind
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of thinking it's really easy, just the process is easier and faster than
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the hard way) is to be able to think rationally and reason your way to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wise choices.  As it turns out, this way gets more right answers faster
</em><br>
<em> &gt; (still limited by time in the sense that I mentioned).  The equation you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; proposed should look more like this (in Smalltalk/Obj-C like syntax):
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wisdom = [your_mind intelligentThoughtWithKnowledge: your_knowledge
</em><br>
<em> &gt; experience: (your_experience + vicarious_experience) forTime: t];
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; :-)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The only issue with time is spending time thinking about things that,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; upon drawing conclusions, will make you wiser.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; To be fair, though, I obtain wisdom both ways.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; As for this being adolescent egoism, I don't think there's much that can
</em><br>
<em> &gt; be said to dissuade you of that position.  I understand why you think
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that way, but it's wrong to think that wisdom is necessarily correlated
</em><br>
<em> &gt; with age, though it often is.
</em><br>
<p>It is only possible to gather knowledge so fast.  Plus, for a
<br>
substantial fraction of the first 20 years, many of the mental building
<br>
blocks are still under development.  Exact ages at which the
<br>
architecture of the mind is fully in place vary.  Also, the rate at
<br>
which one is exposed to knowledge varies.
<br>
<p>For &quot;soft&quot; (interpersonal) skills a child who has highly social (and
<br>
afluent would help) parents who expose him/her to many cultures and
<br>
individuals would greatly decrease the time it takes to gather such
<br>
knowledge.  Likewise, a child who is given extensive access to
<br>
scientists, researchers and related materials/equipment would gather
<br>
knowledge in those regions faster.  But *most* people don't have access
<br>
to vast quantities of knowledge in such ways.  Therefor my belief that,
<br>
in most cases, it takes significant time.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; As Eli suggested, demonstrating wisdom
</em><br>
<em> &gt; goes a lot further than claiming to be wise towards proving wiseness to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; someone (of course if you're wise enough you know that it doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em> &gt; what most people think of you and act on it, but I digress).
</em><br>
<p>Correct.  But, is it possible to understand the wisdom of someone who is
<br>
more wise than they are?  Lookup &quot;up&quot; it may not be possible to tell
<br>
someone else is more wise (much like intelligence tends to work).  Only
<br>
it is even more difficult to demonstrait wisdom.
<br>
<p>People on SL4 are free to make judgements regarding my intelligence,
<br>
wisdom, egotism or whatever the like.  But unless someone can convince
<br>
me to change my view I will continue on my present course (which
<br>
includes, among other things, getting us to a safe Singularity).
