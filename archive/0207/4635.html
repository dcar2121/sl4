<p>I want to clarify a few things about Buddha School cultivation ways for 
<br>
everyone.  I think this will help the conversation since I can see there 
<br>
is some confusion as to what aspects of Zen Buddhism are religious and 
<br>
are not religious and how these differences are important.
<br>
<p>Buddha School cultivation ways are in and of themselves not religions.  
<br>
The Buddha Fa (the laws and principles of the Buddha School) is quite 
<br>
diverse and the Buddhist Dharma (viz. the Dharma taught by Guatama 
<br>
Siddhartha) is a small part of the Buddha Fa.  There are many other 
<br>
cultivation ways that take different approaches to reaching the same 
<br>
point.  For example, Falun Dafa offers another means of attaining 
<br>
enlightenment.  Kirshnamurti offers teachings to reach enlightenment 
<br>
that have more grounding in modern cognitive sciences (or as modern as 
<br>
they were during his life time).  All of them have the goal of reaching 
<br>
a point where there is an end to goal oriented thought and a death of 
<br>
the self.  Of course, I think the thing that confuses everyone is that 
<br>
this doesn't mean that an enlightened being is incapable of action, he 
<br>
just doesn't have any goals to get in the way of his seeing the truth 
<br>
and doing what is right.
<br>
<p>The Buddhist religion includes several cultivation ways.  Each of these 
<br>
cultivation ways has a religion built up around it.  Zen, in my opinion, 
<br>
is a much harder cultivation way to take, but then cultivation isn't 
<br>
supposed to be simple.  The reason that Zen is hard is because it 
<br>
refuses to teach Dharma, thus understanding must come on it's own 
<br>
without any assistance.  The whole existence of koans illustrates the 
<br>
oddness of Zen, in that one spends a long time creating the right mental 
<br>
state such that one can be enlightened as easily as a chain of dominos 
<br>
will fall with a slight push.  To be fair, though, there is no 
<br>
cultivation way where you can think your way to enlightenment, so in the 
<br>
end you still have to have a death of thought (in the goal oriented 
<br>
sense).
<br>
<p>Buddhism has it's problems as a religion and, like all religions, tends 
<br>
to get in the way of getting the real benefits of the teachings.  I 
<br>
think if people just listened to the teachings of Jesus they'd be a lot 
<br>
better off, but it's not so simple because of religion, which sets about 
<br>
to create all sorts of things around what he said and ends up twisting 
<br>
it around so much that you give up and just decide to act like a human 
<br>
(and, as the /Hitchhiker's Guide/ points out, all Jesus ever did was try 
<br>
to get people to be nice to each other and they killed him for it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I have already said that Zen is a special case.  If Zen is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of looking at the world that is beyond desirability or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undesirability - much like science in that respect, I've always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought - then within Zen a Friendly AI is not desirable or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undesirable; it simply *is*, whether the existence of a Friendly AI is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a truth that would be reflected in the internal experience of a Zen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practitioner, or an illusion to which no attention at all should be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paid.  A Friendly AI might fully understand a Zen practitioner, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what would the practitioner care?
</em><br>
<p>Zen isn't really a special case.  The way I see it, enlightenment is 
<br>
also the end result of rational thinking.  Ultimately, thinking 
<br>
rationally involves eliminating all biases, not just biases that can be 
<br>
eliminated reasonable, thus the rational thinker, upon reaching ultimate 
<br>
rationality, will enter a quiet state where the only thoughts are those 
<br>
arising from the truth.  The only difference between rational thinking 
<br>
and a Buddha School cultivation way is that it doesn't have all the 
<br>
discussion of mysticism and that there is another level of attainment 
<br>
before enlightenment known as rationality (for those confused, I posit 
<br>
that there is a hard line between someone who is irrational and only 
<br>
stumbles onto rational thought and someone who is rational).
<br>
<p>For those curious, I have been in the state of ding before, which is in 
<br>
some sense a window unto enlightenment, so I do speak from experience.  
<br>
I'm sure I've gotten some of this wrong and it will look very different 
<br>
once I'm enlightened.  Also, on the point of there being a hard line 
<br>
between irrationality and rationality, it may be that the Buddha School 
<br>
refers to this as being Beyond-Triple-World Cultivation, but to be 
<br>
honest it is not very clear to me whether being Beyond-Triple-World 
<br>
Cultivation means that you are enlightened and you are now to begin on 
<br>
your path to nirvana or if it is a point where you have had a 
<br>
fundamental change in your thinking that makes enlightenment possible.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I hope I haven't bored the list to death with this, but I get 
<br>
the feeling that people are interested, so I thought I'd share my 
<br>
knowledge.
