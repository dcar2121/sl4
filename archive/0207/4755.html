<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;At least he does not ignore obvious mathematical facts. I don't know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether he is right, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sloppy reasoning is much better than merely emotional attitudes. (i.e. yours)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My emotional attitudes are merely why I find his more 
<br>
irritating, not why I think he is wrong. I have quite a lot of good 
<br>
arguments as to why he is wrong, from arguments against the Chinese 
<br>
Room to arguments in favour of plausible purely connectionist 
<br>
cognition, to arguments against quantum effects being that 
<br>
significant as a general neuron mechanism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone on this list (or at all) could rule out the possibility that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Penrose could be right.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you aren't going to rule out the possibility that he could 
<br>
be right just because his reasoning is sloppy, its hard to rule out 
<br>
the idea that anyone could be right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I also think the Chinese room analogy should not be treated as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complete nonsense. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not a strict argument, but, for me, an intuitive hint, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness may have more substance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than it appears at the first sight.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed. But once you realistically start getting into 
<br>
self-modifying Chinese Rooms with internal state equivalent to that 
<br>
of a human being, it gets very silly indeed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But its interesting just how far you CAN get in impersonating 
<br>
a human being using ALICE, for example, which is pretty much along 
<br>
the lines of Chinese Room style canned response.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese Room is not a good argument against machine 
<br>
consciousness, but it may well be a good argument against Turing 
<br>
Tests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is some mystical about self-consciousness (if you meditate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about it  a bit),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is some mystical about quantum mechanics (if you think abbout it a bit)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and there is strong link between these two (phase reduction).
</em><br>
<p>Thats about the level of reasoning I think Penrose is at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Perhaps he is wrong in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;details, but there is a good chance that he's got the correct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overall intuition.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That might be where we differ - I think there is an excellent 
<br>
chance he has that wrong, and I think there are many flaws in the 
<br>
reasoning that gets him there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My point : It is not a correct to say that argument A must be wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since it is similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the wrong statement B (vitalism in your case). This leads to nowhere.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but that was why I found it more irritating, not why its wrong!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think Edelman has some flaws, but overall I think he is 
<br>
heading in the right direction. I think Penrose is heading in the 
<br>
wrong direction, and for the wrong reasons.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers
<br>
