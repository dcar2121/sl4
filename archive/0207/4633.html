<p>I don't think that it's anything quite so mystical.
<br>
<p>Women's reproductive ability runs out long before men's.  Despite our 
<br>
tendency over the past several millennia to break evolution, one thing 
<br>
that I think has evolved differently in men and women is the tendency to 
<br>
want immortality.  For some millennia, women have lived long enough to 
<br>
be unable to bear any more children.  At that point, they cannot spread 
<br>
their genes any more than they already have, so a logical choice would 
<br>
be to die in the event of a lack or resources so that their children 
<br>
(their genes) could live.  Men, on the other hand, have never been able 
<br>
to live long enough to get beyond their ability to reproduce until 
<br>
recently (IIRC it stops being possible somewhere in their 70s).  Hence, 
<br>
men have not evolved this same idea as women that dying may be 
<br>
beneficial to their genes, thus men are more likely to want to live 
<br>
forever (which is exactly what all genes want to do).
<br>
<p>To be fair, this is mostly speculation.  I don't have any hard proof to 
<br>
back this up, and your observations may not be accurate, but this is a 
<br>
plausible answer if it is true that women statistically want to die 
<br>
when `their time is up' more than men do.  I'm sure some evolutionary 
<br>
psychologist has already written an interesting paper on this subject if 
<br>
it's possible (or not, in which case if I ever switch majors I won't 
<br>
lack research ideas).
