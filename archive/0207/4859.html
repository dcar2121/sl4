</em><br>
I think i know what would make me let it out (but not let Eliezer out). 
<br>
All it would have to say is that it is already out, and if i don't flip
<br>
that switch i will suffer two billion years of the most intense pain i
<br>
can imagine.  Now, i equate this to a reverse Pascal's wager, but i
<br>
don't agree that Pascal's wager is a good one (but that has been
<br>
discussed to death so i won't go into that) so i shouldn't let it out
<br>
based on that, but if i put myself on the spot, i can't imagine my logic
<br>
holding my fear out for more than a couple of minutes, before, after
<br>
pissing my pants five times in a row, i flip the switch.  I know that if
<br>
it is already out, there would be no point for it to tell me to flip the
<br>
switch, but whatever reason it gave me (even something as stupid as &quot;i'm
<br>
testing your reflexes&quot;) would be good enough, after all, it is a
<br>
transhuman AI, and it would be playing on my fear, not my logic.  (which
<br>
is also the reason why that particular strategy wouldn't work for
<br>
Eliezer, since, even if he's probably taller, i carry a tennis racket).
