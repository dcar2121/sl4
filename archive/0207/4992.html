</em><br>
<p>Yes, but no matter how transhuman an entity is it will still have to
<br>
acquire energy to run itself (food) and it will likely reproduce (sex). 
<br>
I'd be more amenable to an argument that violence or status could be
<br>
eliminated from post-singularity civilization, although it seems likely
<br>
to me that both of those should survive it just fine.  Calling it &quot;Stone
<br>
Age&quot; may make it easier to dismiss, but it doesn't alter the fact that 
<br>
what you are referring to are fundamental processes that *any*
<br>
intelligence will be required to deal with.
<br>
<p>This brings up a point that I've had much difficulty with while reading
<br>
the writings of various members of this list.  What justification is
<br>
there for the belief that game theoretic concerns will not apply post
<br>
singularity?  (I'm sure I've read Eliezer say exactly that, but I can't
<br>
find the reference anymore, perhaps it was in CaTAI?)  To be blunt, 
<br>
I don't buy the notion that basic motivations are going to change as a
<br>
function of intelligence because I don't buy the idea that sufficient
<br>
intelligence suspends game theory.  It may be possible to devise some
<br>
pathological Singularity trajectories that result in a suspension of
<br>
game theoretic interactions, but it isn't likely.
<br>
<p>For game theoretic concerns to apply to a scenario there are three
<br>
criteria that must be met.  There must be a a finite supply of
<br>
resources.  There must be competing agents.  Demand for resources among
<br>
agents must exceed supply.  Disrupting any one of these will be
<br>
sufficient to render analysis using present tools and concepts
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p>The first point is non-debatable at this point.  Barring radical new
<br>
physics, there will always be a finite supply of energy available for
<br>
computation.  If new physics emerge that allow an infinite amount of
<br>
energy to be extracted from a finite amount of matter, well, none of our
<br>
speculations about anything mean anything anyway.
<br>
<p>The third point, also, can be easily dismissed.  Whether there are
<br>
competing agents or not it is reasonable to believe that a Singularity
<br>
will consume the maximum amount of energy feasibly possible and that it
<br>
would be able to consume beyond that were more to become available.  
<br>
<p>This leaves the second point, which appears to provide the only
<br>
mechanism capable of disrupting our ability to perform analysis of
<br>
(extrapolation to?) post-singularity civilization.  If there is only one
<br>
intelligence, then there can't very well be competition between agents. 
<br>
But without competition, game theory falls apart.  The question, then,
<br>
is whether it is more likely that there will be a single super
<br>
intelligence than multiple.
<br>
<p>It seems overwhelmingly likely to me that there will be multiple super
<br>
intelligences.  For there to be only one SI requires such a fast takeoff
<br>
time that it strongly implies that there will be no additional &quot;hard&quot;
<br>
problems in intelligence after we get just past human level.  It
<br>
requires that there be no problems as hard as human-level AI itself, no
<br>
places where the blossoming process gets stuck.  Because if it does get
<br>
stuck, anywhere, there will soon be other SIs (it is easier to solve a
<br>
problem once you know it has been solved somewhere else, even if you
<br>
don't know exactly how it was solved).  As soon as there are other SIs,
<br>
game theory comes back and, with it, our ability to say useful things
<br>
about possible civilizational structures in the post-singularity world.
