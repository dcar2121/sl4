<p>Perhaps I'm overly skeptical, but I seriously doubt that your 20 year
<br>
old self could have modeled the world at anything even remotely
<br>
resembling the complexity that your 35-year-old self does.  And
<br>
multiplying that by several billion humans living longer than they would
<br>
in a primal state leads to the conclusion that the world is vastly,
<br>
subjectively different today than at any time in history.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly nowhere near comparable to, say, the transition from primate mind

</em><br>
<p>Indeed.  But arguing that *another* transcension is imminent in no way
<br>
detracts from the position that we, as a species, have already
<br>
transcended our historical notion of humanity at least once.  Moving
<br>
from nomadic groups of 30-50 individuals to a globally networked
<br>
civilization with members who regularly interact with thousands of
<br>
others is a change of such magnitude that it is hard to appreciate,
<br>
especially from our privileged perch within the process, the true scope
<br>
of the alterations.
