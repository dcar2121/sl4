<p>If Cyc could read (it cannot) and was a Seed AI (which it is not), then it
<br>
would immediately find the following from NORD (National Organization for
<br>
Rare Disorders):
<br>
<p>&quot;Femoral-Facial Syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs for no apparent
<br>
reason (sporadically). However, there have been two reported cases in
<br>
which the disorder was believed to be inherited as an autosomal dominant
<br>
genetic trait. The major symptoms of this disorder are underdeveloped
<br>
thigh bones and unusual facial features.&quot;
<br>
<p>And here are some images that a Seed AI would find:

<br>
<p>I suggest that your frustration on locating extremely specific
<br>
information on a dear yet obscure topic has blinded you from the vast
<br>
online repository of online textbooks and knowledge sources.  A Seed AI need not
<br>
deal with paper patent filings and applications - they are online as I
<br>
have previously written.
<br>
<p>Your point here is not a valid counterexample to my refutation of your
<br>
previous post.  In fact there is a large effort underway to open all
<br>
medical journal articles to the public at no cost.  The British Journal
<br>
of Medicine and the NIH are leading the way, with strong efforts by a
<br>
number of researchers and educators.
<br>
<p>See for example:
