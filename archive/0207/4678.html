<em>&gt;&gt; James, we live in the absolutely most interesting, terrifying, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; significant time in all of the history of the universe.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Singularity is it!  If this had ever happened before, anywhere, we'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have heard about it.  Nothing we could imagine could be as fascinating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or as scary as reality right now.  Never before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This small piece of time is definitely all those things.  But lets not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get ahead of ourselves, we have no idea if this has happened before.  My 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal opinion is that this type of thing has probably happened many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times but that its usually cataclysmic.  Hell, as pointed out repeatedly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we may just be simulations.
</em><br>
<p>Or maybe Earth is an SI glider gun.  Periodically such a beastie 
<br>
is created along with a grew of posthumans.  Being Friendly, 
<br>
they do what they can to respect the self-determination 
<br>
decisions of all sentients including those not ready/willing to 
<br>
transcend.  The result is an Earth with the technological clock 
<br>
reset and the transcended parts of the crew going elsewhere. 
<br>
The cycle begins again.  Salt to taste with those not ready 
<br>
being popped into a VR within the SI and only apparently living 
<br>
and dying (perhaps multiple times) until they come to a decision 
<br>
and some understanding[s] that allows them to do something else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if we don't get a Singularity this will be true.  Widespread 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; availability of nano-technology will make the industrial base completely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obsolete overnight.  Just this one aspect of the future would completely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change everything.  The value structure of the entire world will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transform overnight with very few things retaining much value.  The most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valuable commodities post-nano will be raw materials (including land) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and information.  Some level of service organizations may survive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on how things go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you think maybe the powers that be saw this possibility and 
<br>
wrecked the tech sector on purpose to slow it down until they 
<br>
could maybe put more controls in?  Naw, probably simple 
<br>
stupidity is enough of an explanation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not at all convinced that a good outcome is likely (I suspect the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposite is true).  However, I don't see that humanity has much choice.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The nature of man is such that we will continue to progress.  Even if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all technology was destroyed today humans will either eventually reach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of no return or will be destroyed by other means.  I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopeful that everything will turn out ok, though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well, we have all the choice that there is right now.  If we 
<br>
believe that the basic nature of ourselves leads to a not good 
<br>
outcome then we have no choice but to do all we can to change or 
<br>
transcend some of that nature or ameliorate its effects to 
<br>
increase the probability of a good outcome.  Or create something 
<br>
more powerful than us that has our best interest in mind, a FAI.
