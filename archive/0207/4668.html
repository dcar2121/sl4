Mitch Howe:
<br>
<em>&gt;There are more potential reasons that I can't think of at the moment, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should be apparent that a highly intelligent AGI should have no trouble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;finding valid interpretations for each and every empirical perception that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would put it in harmony with God's Plan as described by the Mormon faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But naturally, there would be no rational reason to do this unless it had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acquired a Testimony of the Gospel through non-empirical means -- perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;evidence of things not seen.&quot; -- which I guess is another one of those Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things creeping up in diverse religions...  So chalk up another point under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Religious folk see AGI as needing non-empirical perception to arrive at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ultimate truth.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I too was trapped within the particular circular argument which is Mormonism until 20 yrs
<br>
old and can testify;) to the truthfulness of what Mitch is saying.  The doctrine surrounding
<br>
Mormonism is so extensive and education is so encouraged that this strangely framed
<br>
rationality is constantly honed to be used against any doubt that Satan might throw at you.
<br>
On the other hand, having recovered from that perspective, I find the added tendancy to
<br>
test every assumption to be a great advantage.
<br>
In many ways I can contribute my awakening out of this state to singularity related thought.
<br>
In a period of doubt on my mission after having baptized a young boy in less than ideal
<br>
circumstances, I purchased Godel, Escher, Bach and Tipler's The Physics of Immortality.
<br>
At the time I considered Tipler rather absurd, but GEB touched me deeply.  This was
<br>
against mission rules, but having read them I could no longer maintain even the facade of
<br>
certainty about what I was supposed to be teaching.
<br>
<p>I suppose what I'd like the readers of this list to know is that intelligent, even scientificly apt
<br>
people are sometimes convinced of ridiculous positions and maintain them out of positive
<br>
human characteristics.  Some of these people can arrive at a new worldview, and I think
<br>
that anyone who scraps their basic assumptions and takes stock of the world today has
<br>
a fair chance of predictiing the singularity.
