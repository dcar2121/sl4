Your disagreement with Edelman is the same as mine:  He has this stupid idea
<br>
that connectionist, differential-equations-based processes cannot be
<br>
simulated using discrete digital processes.  I think he's just obviously
<br>
wrong.  I still like his ideas anyway, even though he makes this one
<br>
elementary mistake.  I think this mistake is largely borne of his ignorance
<br>
of theoretical computer science and theoretical physics.   Roger Penrose
<br>
makes a less ignorant case for the noncomputability of brain/mind, though I
<br>
think he's wrong too...
<br>
<p>In terms of the comparison between consciousness and a sensory modality, I
<br>
guess this exists in his book only at a high level of abstraction ;)  The
<br>
neural structures that he suggests for consciousness are very similar to
<br>
neural structures for sensory perception.  it's just that they involve more
<br>
re-entrance, so that the neural-map-building circuitry is used to observe
<br>
the inner workings of the mind rather than the outputs of perceptual
<br>
neurons...

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Goertzel, The book you recommended &quot;A UNIVERSE OF CONSCIOUSNESS&quot; by
<br>
Gerald M. Edelman and Giulio Tononi, in response to my comment that
<br>
consciousness might have some things in common with a sensory modality,
<br>
turns out to be not exactly as you stated.  I read the whole book carefully
<br>
and at no point did it make any comparisons between consciousness and a
<br>
sensory modality.  Nevertheless, I am glad you recommended it.  It is an
<br>
excellent book.  I learned a lot of neuroanatomy.  The book included a
<br>
complete model of the functioning brain.  I can't say that I didn't have
<br>
some disagreements with the author, but it was still enlightening to see
<br>
another point of view, stimulating new perspectives.  It basically proposed
<br>
that consciousness was a network of corticothalamic circuits with peripheral
<br>
algorithmic subprocesses in the amygdale and cerebellum.  His contention
<br>
that consciousness is not algorithmic but rather connectionist relational in
<br>
nature does not bode well for my particular preference in AI design.  He
<br>
states that consciousness is not the result of a deterministic process but
<br>
requires the fuzziness of a biological substrate.  Personally, I thing any
<br>
fuzzy connectionists process can be simulated by an algorithmic
<br>
deterministic design.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike.
