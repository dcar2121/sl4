<p>GW&gt; I chose my wording carefully:  I only assert that this is true, but 
<br>
GW&gt; admit completely that I cannot prove one way or another whether free 
<br>
GW&gt; will exists (if it can be proven please point me in the direction of 
<br>
GW&gt; such a proof, since I have not spent endless time thinking on this).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a hard science standpoint, it is as far as I can see
</em><br>
fundamentally unprovable.
<br>
<p>GW&gt; As far as what free will is (and what I was thinking when I wrote this), 
<br>
GW&gt; I use the common, folk sense of the word, meaning that you, at any time, 
<br>
GW&gt; can decide to do or think anything.  In other words, the common sense of 
<br>
GW&gt; free will implies that you have a magic box in your head that 
<br>
GW&gt; nondeterministically decides what happens in your brain next and it 
<br>
GW&gt; could be anything that `you' want (remember, its `you' that has the free 
<br>
GW&gt; will).
<br>
<p>But you're mixing levels and metaphors when you choose to use a common
<br>
sense understanding of concepts like &quot;you&quot; and &quot;decide&quot; and &quot;free
<br>
will&quot; -- and the implied, underlying concept of &quot;consciousness&quot; -- and
<br>
then refute it from a scientific perspective.  You've shown exactly
<br>
nothing by doing this, because you haven't scientifically defined what
<br>
it is you're disproving the existence of.
<br>
<p>Again, &quot;consciousness&quot; can AFAICT as a matter of principle never be
<br>
proven to exist: it has no weight, no smell, no physical properties
<br>
whatsoever, no location (see the essays &quot;Where Am I&quot; by Dennett and
<br>
&quot;Where Was I&quot; by Sanford, both readily Googlable).  Its existence can
<br>
very tenuously be argued to be inferencable from the evidence, but all
<br>
such evidence of existence by inference falls flat upon even cursory
<br>
examination.
<br>
<p>So does this mean &quot;consciousness&quot; does not exist?  What would even be
<br>
meant by the statement &quot;consciousness does not exist&quot;?  We would have
<br>
to define in some rigorous way what we mean by the word to begin with,
<br>
which I maintain is next to impossible.  But if it were, any workable
<br>
definition would have to include its existence...I can't formulate the
<br>
exact reasons why, but, ehm, trust me, it would.
<br>
<p>David Chalmers has written some interesting thoughts on what he calls
<br>
the &quot;hard problem&quot;, see
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/facing.html">http://www.u.arizona.edu/~chalmers/papers/facing.html</a>
<br>
<p>GW&gt; As for alternative definitions of free will, I'm not very interested.  
<br>
GW&gt; Once you clear out the mystical means of choice, your choice is no
<br>
GW&gt; longer free but restricted by the confines of your brain and your 
<br>
GW&gt; current mind state.
<br>
<p>How is the concept of &quot;mind&quot; any less mystical?
<br>
<p>GW&gt; That's it for tonight.  I have been kept up far too late with all the 
<br>
GW&gt; Independence Day fun that everyone managed to involve me in.

embroiled in what IMO is essentially semantic games.
