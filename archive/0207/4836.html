<em>&gt;&gt; Obviously a great many people feel this way.  But why would the human

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to Freud, in his great book &quot;Civilization and its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discontents,&quot; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes from the fact that large parts of our brains want us to run wild

</em><br>
<p>Bleh, sounds like, as usual, Freud was starting to think about the right 
<br>
things, but, because of the times and his own lack of rigor, failed to 
<br>
reach a conclusion that matches up with what we now know about the human 
<br>
mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; According to David Bohm, in &quot;Thought as a System,&quot; it comes from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;fragmentation of mind&quot; that modern culture has brought, as opposed to 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wholeness&quot; of the primitive mindset and the greater wholeness of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Bohm seems to have this a bit backwards.  The human mind starts out very 
<br>
fragmented and has to be cultivated towards wholeness, which is away 
<br>
from the primitive mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; According to Indian religions, it's due to the &quot;veil of Maya&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from perceiving true nirvanic reality underneath...
</em><br>
<p>Here are my thoughts on this.  The human brain is programmed to be a 
<br>
good reproducer.  Better reproducers have been smarter and more able, 
<br>
thus over the millennia humans have evolved to be smarter, faster, 
<br>
stronger.  But, why should that be enough? Within the individual 
<br>
lifetime of a human, he can become even smarter, faster, and stronger 
<br>
than he would be if he had an average life.  If he had the ability, and 
<br>
the need, to dedicate himself to something greater, he could become a 
<br>
better reproducer than he was when he started out.  Consequently, humans 
<br>
with this need to be something greater (they feel like they are missing 
<br>
something; like they are incomplete) are better reproducers (assuming 
<br>
that they act on this desire) and, over time, out produce the slacker 
<br>
humans.  Ergo, we get today's situation:  humans feel the need to be 
<br>
something greater, so they join a cult, take up body building, or just 
<br>
do something that they think will make them a better.  As persons' 
<br>
choices indicate, they don't always pick something that will actually 
<br>
lead to greater reproductive ability, but this is most likely because 
<br>
humans only evolved the desire to be better and never a system to check 
<br>
if the actions to satisfy the desire are doing any good (of course you 
<br>
can develop such a system, but it isn't hardwired so people make dumb 
<br>
choices).
<br>
<p>As for more primitive humans having less of this feeling (and this may 
<br>
not be true; this could be stuff out of anthropology the pseudoscience), 
<br>
they simply have less of this desire than more advanced humans.  If they 
<br>
had evolved with more desire to be better, they'd be more advanced and 
<br>
we'd be the primitives or their peers.  Personally, I suspect that the 
<br>
level of desire for betterment is about the same in all humans and 
<br>
primitive people only continue to exist for geographical and cultural 
<br>
reasons.
