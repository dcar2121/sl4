This is the first of a few replies.  I've finally caught up on my SL4 
<br>
reading after being behind for about a week.

<p>There are two things I want to mention.
<br>
<p>First, Ben, this is just a diction issue, but intuition, unless used in 
<br>
some technical sense, is a misleading word.  The only reason a thought 
<br>
is an `intuition' is because your brain thought it up and only told you 
<br>
the answer, not the process involved in reaching the answer.  Since we 
<br>
know that the only black box aspect of `intuitions' is that you don't 
<br>
have accesses to the specifics of how you reached an answer (though your 
<br>
interpreter will be happy to rationalize a reason for you), it's more 
<br>
accurate to say that this is simply what you think.  Intuition 
<br>
constantly sounds to me like you're claiming you were divinely inspired 
<br>
in your thoughts (which may be possible if science isn't right, but 
<br>
AFAIK such a possibility is not readily within your world view).
<br>
<p>Second, the social behavior of overconfidence tends to be a side effect 
<br>
of rational thinking.  The more rationally you think, the more sure you 
<br>
are of your ideas that are in final enough form to tell to other 
<br>
people.  In social games, though, overconfidence is shunned by everyone 
<br>
else vying to become chief because it gives the person who is 
<br>
overconfident a better chance of becoming chief (&quot;ug oh, he sure of 
<br>
idea; he right&quot;).  This has become the racial proverb that 
<br>
overconfidence is always to be shunned.  This is correct when it comes 
<br>
to your average, irrational human.  As I stated, though, this is not 
<br>
true of a rational thinker.  If the person really is rational, then they 
<br>
shouldn't be able to be overconfident because that's irrational 
<br>
behavior.  In other words, Eliezer is only overconfident if he is not 
<br>
yet rational enough to be outside that kind of thinking.
<br>
<p>I have no idea whether he really is that rational or not, but my own 
<br>
opinion from my interactions with him is that he is.
