<p>
It's been some time since I was actively involved in research on the
<br>
development of mammalian cortex but let me try to answer some of Emil
<br>
Gilliam's questions:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It is not enough merely to point out the notorious
<br>
complexity of protein folding, at least without some good argument about
<br>
&quot;how much&quot; of this complexity gives rise to the functional complexity we
<br>
see in the mind (or any other organ).
<br>
<p>### The complexity of protein folding is only indirectly implicated in the
<br>
formation of the brain, in the sense that it merely provides the lower level
<br>
building blocks - the direct source or cortical complexity lies higher.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
&nbsp;I guess what I'm really wondering
<br>
is &quot;where&quot; in the genome we can expect to find the difference between
<br>
one purported mental module and another, and how this encoding scheme is
<br>
not hostile to the evolution of new mental modules by natural selection.
<br>
<p>### During ontogeny the cortical sheet is imprinted by concentration
<br>
gradients of morphogenetic molecules, such as LAMP, Emx and Dmx gene
<br>
products, some members of the FGF family, and doubtlessly many others. The
<br>
combinations of morphogene concentrations at particular points on the sheet
<br>
direct the neuroblasts to differentiate into module-specific phenotypes.
<br>
There is a cascade of such specifying events, starting with the
<br>
establishment of main AP and DV axes (initiated by morphogenes acting even
<br>
before the formation of the brain), all the way to the subdivision into
<br>
single cortical areas. A single morphogen can appear a number of times at
<br>
progressively higher levels of differentiation. Thus, even if the number of
<br>
true mophogenes was less than a hundred, their spatial and temporal
<br>
combination could specify the oft-quoted 10,000 types of neurons. What each
<br>
cell does is to integrate chemical (and later - electric) inputs, and
<br>
respond with e.g expression of receptors to other morphogens and sending
<br>
axons to areas specified by these morphogenes. New modules can be formed if
<br>
the response of cells at some point in space (on the cortical sheet) and
<br>
time (e.g. 6th month of pregnancy) to the local morphogenes is changed - e.g
<br>
a receptor is not expressed (due to a mutation in its promotor), and the
<br>
cells instead start responding to competing morphogenes. If the new cortical
<br>
area turns out to be doing something useful, the mutation will be favored by
<br>
selection.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>Since we don't really know, can someone explain at least what we might
<br>
expect an answer to this question to look like?
<br>
<p>### Hundreds of morphogenes but probably not thousands, with thousands of
<br>
possible combinatorial responses encoded in the promotor genes,in the
<br>
protein-protein interactions, and other places. Scientists like Pat Levitt,
<br>
who discovered LAMP (Limbic Associated Membrane Protein) and in whose lab I
<br>
had the privilege to work, have enough to keep them occupied for years to
<br>
come.
