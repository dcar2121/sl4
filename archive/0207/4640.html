</em><br>
<p>Hmm, seems what I wrote does sound rather strange and religious.  That 
<br>
wasn't my intention, but, since having become completely areligious, I 
<br>
tend to not notice when I say or write things that sound religious in 
<br>
nature.
<br>
<p>My point of this was that Jesus, from what we know of him, was teaching 
<br>
people to be nice to each other and get outside of anthropomorphic 
<br>
thinking.  I have no idea just how far his teachings went, since I have 
<br>
not studied them in depth.  Anyway, then a religion grows up around him 
<br>
and the result is that no one who is trying to learn from him through 
<br>
Christianity is learning very much of what we think he was really 
<br>
teaching.
<br>
<p>The same thing, in my opinion, has happened with Buddhism.  Siddhartha 
<br>
comes along with his Dharma that will help lead people to enlightenment, 
<br>
and 500 years after his death a religion has sprung up and very few 
<br>
persons are becoming enlightened.
<br>
<p>In general this seems to be the trend with most religions focused on 
<br>
attaining some form of enlightenment (even if that's getting into 
<br>
heaven, which is basically the same thing as achieving nirvana).  Of 
<br>
course, religions of aboriginal people, paganism, and related religions 
<br>
don't qualify for this, since they tend to grow out of human desires 
<br>
rather than a great, moral way of being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're going to quote someone, don't quote a religious figure, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a disclaimer.  Find a modern secular humanist who has said roughly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing; s/he will undoubtedly have said it far more clearly and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with fewer millennia-old prejudices mixed in.
</em><br>
<p>While this may be a good rule of thumb when communicating to a poorly 
<br>
educated audience, I hope that members of SL4 are beyond the pettiness 
<br>
of discarding ideas based on the perceived credentials of the person who 
<br>
spoke them.  If not, I might as well just post to Extropians or, heaven 
<br>
forbid, Usenet.
<br>
<p>At any rate, I don't really have any plans to make direct quotes of 
<br>
Jesus or Siddhartha, since I doubt their exact words have survived the 
<br>
centuries.  Paraphrasing the content of their ideas, though, may prove 
<br>
worthwhile.  Besides, any modern secular humanist who said roughly the 
<br>
same thing is likely to have his own set of reasons to be incredible 
<br>
(and there are likely to be hordes of people ready to tell me that I 
<br>
didn't understand what he *really* meant).
