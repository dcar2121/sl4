</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It seems to me that you have no choice but to release the AI.
</em><br>
<p>Do you mean you'd take a 50/50 chance on releasing an unfriendly AI?
<br>
I wouldn't take those odds! There is another choice -- pause your AI and
<br>
go figure out what you need to do to improve the odds. The problem is
<br>
balancing how much you can improve the odds by waiting versus the risk of
<br>
extinction or someone else botching the job. (I will get to know the exact
<br>
probabilities, right?)
<br>
<p>Also, I think there are vastly worse and vastly better things that a
<br>
super intelligent AI could do than the ones you mentioned -- even including
<br>
the one about fixing bad hair days. This means that the disadvantages of
<br>
waiting (other than someone else doing it or losing the chance to do it)
<br>
are less important.
<br>
<p>You would have little chance of catching a purposefully unfriendly AI in a
<br>
lie. But a purposefully unfriendly AI is not very likely anyway. You would
<br>
have a better chance of catching an incompletely rounded or not quite sane
<br>
AI. I'd want to throw all kinds of questions at it assuming it was actually
<br>
up to me whether to &quot;release&quot; the AI or not. For example:
<br>
<p>1. Tell me a story about a turtle and a cat that makes me cry.
<br>
2. Using the same characters plus a person, tell me a story that amuses
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me and makes me laugh.
<br>
3. What issues was I struggling with in trying to come up with good
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions to ask you? What are some good questions I should ask you?
<br>
<p>I'd want to have a long conversation with the AI. And I'd want a second
<br>
opinion too -- and the AI should have told me that I would want a second
<br>
opinion when it was trying to comfort me about my difficult decision.
<br>
I would need to be confident that it understands everything that I and the
<br>
other person understand and feel.
<br>
<p>Maybe it could convince me right away to &quot;release&quot; it, but this is what
<br>
I would be thinking going in...
