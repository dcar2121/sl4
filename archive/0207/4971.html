<p>Yup, and designs are sketchy at best so far...

<p><em>&gt; Asimov Law-type injunctions, Friendly Goalsystems, and Goertzel's Novamente's

</em><br>
<p>As far as I know Eliezer doesn't have a complete AI design yet, so it 
<br>
isn't practicle to analyze his approach yet.  Ben doesn't have the 
<br>
Friendliness thing fully worked out.  So both need more work and study...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most other schemes depend on determining the character of the 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; my propensity for hyperbole scare you off, it's just really really a bad 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; are likely to follow rules unintuitive and alien to us. Our social reflexes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are entirely inappropriate. And very misleading, as the AI boxing experiment 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>AI Boxing will almost certainly be employed, however.  It may even 
<br>
proove very useful.  There is a good chance that an infra-human AI won't 
<br>
be able to lie effectively.  A human level AI would most likely be less 
<br>
successful at lieing than, at least, very good human liars.  Plus, it is 
<br>
likely that such AIs would be much less socially developed/skilled than 
<br>
most humans.  At the very least, they will be unpracticed at lieing and 
<br>
will most likely need to develop that ability (which we would, 
<br>
hopefully, notice).  Thus we may well be able to spot trouble using Box 
<br>
Testing before the AI gets to the trans-human stage.  Once there, 
<br>
however, it will likely be very difficult to spot an UnFriendly AI using 
<br>
Box Testing.
