&lt;Lucifer&gt; I remember when Nathan Russell let you out, but that doesn't 
<br>
constitute a proof.
<br>
<em>&gt;&lt;Lucifer&gt; Have you done any box experiments since then?

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;Lucifer&gt; I don't think there is  a chance I could be persuaded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * Eliezer says to Lucifer:  &quot;It's only impressive if you can find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who'll say &quot;NOTHING on EARTH can persuade me to let you out&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then get them to let you out.&quot;
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;&lt;Lucifer&gt; I'm ready, what are the ground rules?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[Eliezer] We open up an IRC channel called #aibox2, which is +s and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;+i.  You can go first so you can be op.  The experiment lasts 2 hours or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;until you decide to let me out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[Eliezer] If you haven't let me out by the end of the experiment, I'll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paypal you, say, $20 - that sound about right?
</em><br>
<p>Is that a sucker bet or what.  Probably the easiest $20 bucks David 
<br>
McFadzean ever made.  Well, then again, he has to listen to Eliezer in 
<br>
private chat for 2 hours straight.  Alone.  Hmm, maybe that's Eliezer's 
<br>
strategy for getting out of the box...   ;)
<br>
<p>Actually, I have a few clarification questions about this.
<br>
<p>In regard to Eliezer's question, &quot;Do you believe that a transhuman AI 
<br>
couldn't persuade you to let it out?&quot;  Specifically I'm assuming these 
<br>
conditions are in place:
<br>
<p>1.  The experiment assumes that the transhuman AI &amp; the programmer are 
<br>
communicating via a chat / TTY connection
<br>
<p>2.  The transhuman AI can not influence the programmer outside of this 
<br>
communications channel
<br>
<p>3.  Safety precautions are in effect (AI does not have control over the 
<br>
speed at which characters are displayed, etc)
<br>
<p>Basically, the above should rule out foul-play by the AI.  After which 
<br>
point it simply has to convince the programmer that its release is in 
<br>
his/her own interest.  Something that should be difficult to convince most 
<br>
AI programmers of (I would hope) and impossible on others.
<br>
<p>My other questions (just for reference): what is the goal of this chat 
<br>
session?  Is the programmer just bored and decided to kill some time 
<br>
talking to his creation?  Is this an interview to consider possible release 
<br>
and/or a less restrictive prison?
<br>
<p>James Higgins
<br>
<p>P.S.  If Lucifer caves and lets you out try me Eliezer.  I can very much 
<br>
guarantee that you couldn't convince me (given my above assumptions) to let 
<br>
you out.
