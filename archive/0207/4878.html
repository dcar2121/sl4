<p>But if it is truly that much more intelligent it could come up with ways

to prove that a flawed friendly design was in fact friendly.  This
<br>
should not be a hard problem for a transhuman.  It might be helpful by
<br>
giving us some insight, but we couldn't actually believe anything
<br>
written by the AI.  I'd like to point out that Humans can write papers
<br>
attempting to prove points that are not in fact true, yet sometimes they
<br>
are believed for many years because there is no substantial opposing
<br>
evidence.  Science is full of this, it is routine to have numerous
<br>
theories about a subject that oppose each other, yet all of them can
<br>
make a good case.  In the case of a transhuman it would be much harder
<br>
for us to spot any holes so it could essentially tell us a story and,
<br>
unless we had decades to verify it, we'd have to take it on faith.
