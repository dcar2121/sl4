One last post before heading off for vacation ;)
<br>
<p>A Catholic friend, who is also a friend of high technology, had the
<br>
following comments to make [these are a bit scattered because they were
<br>
parts of a longer e-mail].
<br>
<p>They are a bit different from that of my other Catholic acquaintance who
<br>
commented on this by telephone....  The disparity between these comments
<br>
shows how tough it is to generalize about &quot;the Catholic's reaction to
<br>
AGI/Singularity&quot;, which is not surprising, given the impossibility of
<br>
generalizing about &quot;the Scientist's reaction to AGI/Singularity&quot;!
<br>
<p>One thing that should be noted is that my circle of friends &amp; acquaintainces
<br>
is very far from a scientific sample of the religious population -- I know
<br>
mostly scientists and techies, and religious folks who are scientists or
<br>
techies also, will generally have views that are a lot more science and tech
<br>
friendly than that of the average religious person.... [Just as, for
<br>
instance, a survey of the scientists I know would reveal that scientists
<br>
tend to have a liking for avant-garde music and existentialist philosophy,
<br>
but this says more about whom I know than about scientists as a whole...]
<br>
<p>anyway here goes:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think the probability of the AGI to arrive at any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific belief system to be vanishingly small, but I also think that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI could consider some religous beliefs to be true. I don't consider it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical that the AGI arrives at my specific beliefs, or at Catholicism or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even at Christianity.
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't want (at this point) to speculate whether an AGI could have a soul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not. I think this question is completely irrelevant. I can't see why a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soul would be necessary to see the truth of Christianity. (I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tempted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put 'truth of Christianity' under quotes '&quot;truth&quot; of Ch.', to make clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that what I see as Ch.'s truth is probably not what you think).
</em><br>
<p><p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own view, *very* briefly summarized, is that no religion is the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct one (I guess this is the point where I disagree with most other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catholics), but that in many/most/all religions some aspects of the *real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth* (whatever that might be) can be found.
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that AGI is possible, and I want to see it happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know whether SI [superintelligence] is possible, but I'm scared by
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; idea of a SI in the hands of the military.
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singulitarian, I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know whether a (the) Singularity will be possible, whether it will happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it is possible, and whether it will be good if it happens. Uploading,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eternal life (in the transhumanist sense), etc. are the things that come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near to my own conflict
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't have answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to find them by considering rational arguments, faith (but not &quot;blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith&quot;), the Bible, etc., and I'm willing to discuss my thoughts. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly not someone who blindly believes others' statements, be it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priests' or the scientists'. I'll consider all arguments and hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the truth myself. I assume an AGI would act similarly.
</em><br>
<p>And that concludes this week's unscientific, undersampled survey of the
<br>
religious population ... hasta la vista folks...
<br>
