<em>&gt;As much as people like to think they have complete free will, the same

</em><br>
<p>When quantum physics is more thoroughly understood I'm certain they will 
<br>
figure out if and how it is related to the human brain.  Until then we're 
<br>
just guessing.
<br>
<p>However, I didn't say the brain needed to be based on quantum mechanics (I 
<br>
just said some people think so).  What I did say is that quantum mechanics 
<br>
could be responsible for the &quot;mystical&quot; capabilities some people believe 
<br>
in.  Even if the brain is not based on quantum mechanics it doesn't mean 
<br>
that it can't detect such things at all.  I have a friend who is very 
<br>
scientific and logical and who (nearly) insists that his grandmother has 
<br>
ESP like ability.  Personally, I've never been convinced of such things 
<br>
but, at the same time, I can't prove they don't exist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Besides, I assert there's no such thing as free will and it's just an 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Of course there is free will, at least on the individual level.
