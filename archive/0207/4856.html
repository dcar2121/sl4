</em><br>
<p>Yes, this would be helpful.  It *might* still be possible for the AI to
<br>
detect such a situation if it were not very, very carefully done though.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, given much longer to reply a human would be likely to use
<br>
better grammar and have better spelling (since they could correct
<br>
themselves).  Other, more subtle, clues may also be present in Human/AI
<br>
communications
<br>
<p><em> &gt; For instance, we *might*, based on how we seeded the AI and how ve grew,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; have reason to think that this chunk of nodes correlates more strongly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to social/psychological analysis/cognition, and that chunk of nodes
</em><br>
<em> &gt; more strongly to spatial/mathematical cognition, etc.
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; Bringing the clockspeed down -- way down -- during an AI box
</em><br>
<em> &gt; experiment would then let us then study such activation patterns at
</em><br>
<em> &gt; our leisure, and speculate as to what was going on, without the AI
</em><br>
<em> &gt; being able to deduce from an increased latency of our replies that we
</em><br>
<em> &gt; were doing so.
</em><br>
<p>The hardware design could use something like VRAM instead of normal RAM
<br>
and be configured so that it could be read by another computer without
<br>
affecting the AI's hardware.  Combined with a slow clock speed you could
<br>
actually record every detail of the AI's processing for detailed analysis.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Just to clarify: I am in no way arguing that speeding us up relative
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to a transhuman AI could make us &quot;just as intelligent&quot;, or that if I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; could just run my brain at 10x the clock speed of yours, that would
</em><br>
<em> &gt; make me 10x as smart -- but I *am* arguing for *some* relative
</em><br>
<em> &gt; improvement, which we can try to maximize by getting the timing right.
</em><br>
<p>But if you could run your brain at 1000x the speed of another person
<br>
that might make you equivelant to 10x as smart.  No guarantee either way
<br>
- we simply don't have the data to know.  But being able to
<br>
intelligently try 1000 possible solutions before picking one should
<br>
greatly improve your intelligence, as percieved by the other party.
