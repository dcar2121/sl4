<em>&gt; Because intelligence is the way to solve all problems.  So whatever it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you want to do, you can do it most effectively with intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Singularity is a subgoal of everything.  That's my reason.
</em><br>
<p>We have seen that a Zen Abbot does not consider it to be a subgoal of
<br>
Enlightenment, his goal
<br>
<p>Also, within the world-view of the average American, the Singularity is not
<br>
really perceived as a subgoal of their main goals of &quot;a house, a good car,
<br>
an attractive &amp; supportive mate and a nice batch of kids.&quot;  Rather, the
<br>
Singularity -- if it's presented to them -- is perceived by them as
<br>
something weird and scary that leads away from this goal into an unknown
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>But, within your perspective, I can see that you're correct (and your
<br>
perspective is close to mine...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1) We are evolutionarily programmed to seek greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not an odd assertion, it probably goes along with the trajectory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increasing intelligence that has resulted in the creation of humans from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; primates...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Introspectively, I can see several adaptations that appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence when it's presented (i.e., &quot;That's wicked clever.&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's also emotional support for excelling at competition, whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that competition takes the form of physical strength or intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I don't know that I can see an drive to actually explicitly seek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>I think this drive exists, and is an abstraction from several more
<br>
particular drives, including the drive to compete, the drive to find an
<br>
optimal mate, to seek social status, etc. etc.
<br>
<p>I do not think it's one of our more powerful drives, however
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although it may be noteworthy in this connection that many men and women
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list &quot;intelligence&quot; as a primary requisite in a desirable mate; some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the women and a few of the men may even have been non-self-deceptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this.
</em><br>
<p>This is not typically self-deception in my view; the majority of men or
<br>
women whom I know would genuinely be unsatisfied with a partner
<br>
significantly less intelligent than themselves.  However, this is really a
<br>
side point in the current conversation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2) Perhaps there is some kind of trans-human force in the universe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pushes toward the creation of greater intelligence, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity itself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just a manifestation of this (this is a &quot;self-organizational&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strictly &quot;evolutionary&quot; answer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have support for this hypothesis of which I am unaware?  Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the support I currently see, I wouldn't have rated this as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth a mention in your reply.  (Unfortunately the human mind seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to accept wishful thinking as &quot;support&quot; - but it's not.)
</em><br>
<p>This is not the sort of hypothesis for which one can list a few items of
<br>
individually convincing evidence.
<br>
<p>For a good depiction of this point of view, see Eric Jantsch's book, &quot;The
<br>
Self-Organizing Universe.&quot;  It's not that current, but the basic ideas are
<br>
still just as valid as ever, in my view.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; 3) There is a kind of existential/emotional lack most humans feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; internally, which causes them to reach out for something greater than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves, be it a God or a future superintelligent being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or it's just a spandrel of our emotional setup that we find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis of a God appealing when it's presented, so if even one person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes up with the idea, the meme propagates.  You don't need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesize an actual reaching out.
</em><br>
<p>My hypothesis is that the modern human psyche generically contains a certain
<br>
lack, a feeling of emptiness.  Obviously this is far from an original idea!
<br>
It's been called many things -- a feeling of aloneness, meaninglessness,
<br>
purposelessness, existential angst...
<br>
<p>Some have claimed this is a consequence of modern civilized society and its
<br>
mismatch with our evolutionary programming, which may well be the case -- I
<br>
suspect it is *largely* but not entirely the case, and that primitive
<br>
peoples also feel something like this, but more weakly, perhaps partly as a
<br>
consequence of the mismatch between their own culture and their evolutionary
<br>
programming...
<br>
<p>This emptiness inside is something almost all humans feel sometimes, to some
<br>
degree, and there is a natural attraction in the human psyche to things that
<br>
give the feeling of completeness and wholeness, of &quot;having the gap filled
<br>
in.&quot;
<br>
<p>Historically, hypotheses of a greater life or world to come have proved to
<br>
have a lot of power in filling in this gap in the human psyche.  The
<br>
hypothesis of a future in which there are greater intelligences than us,
<br>
solving all our problems and then some, would seem to fit into this pattern
<br>
nicely.
<br>
<p>I don't claim that this is *all* of the motivation that humans have for
<br>
seeking to create a greater intelligence, but I think that it is *some* of
<br>
it...
<br>
<p>-- ben g
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seems pretty straightforward
<br>
<em>&gt; that people would be comforted by the thought of a supernatural being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking out for their interests, especially in the afterlife.  It's more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectively pleasant to think about.  An unfortunate byproduct of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivational architecture is that pleasant thoughts tend to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinforced at the expense of painful thoughts for reasons orthogonal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their truth or falsity.
