<em>&gt; &gt; According to Freud, in his great book &quot;Civilization and its

<em>&gt; &gt; Discontents,&quot; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comes from the fact that large parts of our brains want us to run wild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; animals, yet civilization forces us to constrain our activities in ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are &quot;unnatural&quot; to these parts of our brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bleh, sounds like, as usual, Freud was starting to think about the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, but, because of the times and his own lack of rigor, failed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach a conclusion that matches up with what we now know about the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that modern cognitive science contradicts Freud's ideas; it
<br>
just provides a different sort of perspective.
<br>
<p>For instance, a huge percentage of kids today are diagnosed with ADD or
<br>
ADHD.  We can identify the parts of the brain involved with this, and
<br>
address the problem with chemicals.  But it seems to be true that in a
<br>
primitive lifestyle, the traits associated with ADD and ADHD are mostly
<br>
positive ones.  It's modern culture that has made this sort of natural
<br>
personality trait undesirable.  This is an exact example of the sort of
<br>
thing Freud was talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; According to David Bohm, in &quot;Thought as a System,&quot; it comes from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;fragmentation of mind&quot; that modern culture has brought, as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;wholeness&quot; of the primitive mindset and the greater wholeness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mindset before it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bohm seems to have this a bit backwards.  The human mind starts out very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fragmented and has to be cultivated towards wholeness, which is away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the primitive mind.
</em><br>
<p>I think he is more right than you do.
<br>
<p>I think modern culture does bring a lot of personality fragmentation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As for more primitive humans having less of this feeling (and this may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be true; this could be stuff out of anthropology the pseudoscience),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they simply have less of this desire than more advanced humans.  If they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had evolved with more desire to be better, they'd be more advanced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'd be the primitives or their peers.  Personally, I suspect that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of desire for betterment is about the same in all humans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive people only continue to exist for geographical and cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that humans from Stone Age cultures are neurally very
<br>
different from the rest of us.
<br>
The primary differences are almost surely cultural rather than due to
<br>
evolution on the DNA level.
<br>
<p>Most primitive cultures are &quot;steady-state&quot; cultures (see Gregory Bateson's
<br>
work for a discussion of this, e.g. in Steps to an Ecology of Mind).  This
<br>
is a very different orientation from the one in modern culture.  Colin
<br>
Turnbull has described the preindustrial model of time as being spherical
<br>
rather than linear, an insightful metaphor.
