<em>&gt; How I understand Eli's position is that any competent baby will arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the center with no undue respect to original orientation or position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the pen.  (This includes one with your orientation I suppose, so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't much disagree with your approach either.)  To treat human moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems equally requires enough interest from each to place the baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the playpen but, along with a healthy crawling baby, not much more.
</em><br>
<p>What you are proposing here is a very strong hypothesis about the dynamics
<br>
of AGI's.
<br>
<p>Basically, it's a statement that the eventual moral system of an AGI is
<br>
independent of its initial moral system.
<br>
<p>I have no idea whether this is true or not.  So I'm going to guess that the
<br>
eventual moral system of an AGI is more likely to be positively than
<br>
negatively correlated with its initial moral system, and give it a good
<br>
initial moral system.
<br>
<p>I don't think this is exactly what Eli was saying, because in his view,
<br>
giving an AI a Friendly initial moral system is likely to be positively
<br>
correlated with the AGI having a Friendly eventual moral system.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think this makes sense, since there are some human moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems that say AGI and uploading are evil, others that say AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a waste of resources, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Some human moral systems&quot; seriously close to placing a baby in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pen?  Sounds like the latter are celibate.  The former?  Hmmm.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed there... but this was not what Eliezer and I were discussing.  He
<br>
wanted, I believe, the AGI to have no bias toward any particular human moral
<br>
system, regardless of that moral system's relevance to
<br>
