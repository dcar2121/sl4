<em>&gt; This looks tantamount to claiming that only an utterly unlimited

</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Free will&quot; is a relative term.  Computational machinery can only
<br>
deterministically model other computational machines smaller (re: AIC) than
<br>
themselves.  Therefore, it is impossible to deterministically self-model.  I
<br>
define &quot;free will&quot; as not being able to deterministically predict the
<br>
outcome of your own computational processes.  All finite state machinery has
<br>
this property, and not being able to perceive and perfectly evaluate your
<br>
own processes doesn't mean nothing else can either -- that would be the
<br>
logical equivalent of &quot;I can't see you, so you can't see me&quot;.  If you have a
<br>
different (but meaningful) definition of &quot;free will&quot; or assume non-FSM
<br>
computation, then maybe that might change the discussion.
<br>
<p>Of course, this doesn't preclude using external machinery to
<br>
deterministically model yourself, though it puts a different spin on things
<br>
(and creates a feedback loop).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Oh, wait, we are, afaik, capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going beyond our biological limits.  Either way, you lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it is not a question of mathematics at all.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can choose among alternatives, even if the alternatives are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite, you have free will.  Espcially if you can modify your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value and goal structures to some extent.
</em><br>
<p><p>That is an embarrassingly superficial analysis.  When you choose among
<br>
alternatives, how do you know that an SI with access to your computational
<br>
state would not be able to perfectly predict which alternative you would
<br>
pick?  How do you know the modification of your values and goal structure
<br>
are not the result of a deterministic process?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ah, now any questioning of your bald assertions will be taken as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;irrational backlash&quot;.  Sigh.
</em><br>
<p><p>Spare us the melodrama.  Your insistence on reading things into what people
<br>
write is a reflection of your own issues, not everyone else's.  I've
<br>
discussed this topic, rigorously, in other forums with individuals who are a
<br>
lot farther back on the curve than most of the people on this list (though
<br>
technically competent), and was relaying their reaction.  The rigor of the
<br>
actual technical argument was questioned in other forums but held up under
<br>
scrutiny -- there is no magic/difficult mathematical concepts involved.
<br>
<p>I didn't think I would have to go into it too far into detail, as there are
<br>
quite a few people with sufficient background in the relevant areas of
<br>
mathematics on this list that it wouldn't surprise them.  I was only
<br>
pointing it out to refresh memories and keep things on track.  I have
<br>
limited time and don't want to spend it elaborating on things that should be
<br>
obvious to someone with sufficient background and/or can be verified in
<br>
rigorous detail elsewhere.
<br>
<p>How about actually contributing something useful?  Something vaguely
<br>
approximating a rigorous refutation would make for a nice discussion.
