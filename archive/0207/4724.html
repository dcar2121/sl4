<em>&gt; I chose my wording carefully:  I only assert that this is true, but

</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as what free will is (and what I was thinking when I wrote this),

<em>&gt; I use the common, folk sense of the word, meaning that you, at any time,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be anything that `you' want (remember, its `you' that has the free 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will).
</em><br>
<p>The common folk sense of the word is of course worse than 
<br>
useless for discussing such a topic. However, I challenge the 
<br>
contention that the human brain qualifies as deterministic.  It 
<br>
looks to me like it has too many random null input transitions 
<br>
to qualify. :-)  But it is bad debating style to mix up &quot;common 
<br>
sense&quot; notions of something with technical discusions of such as 
<br>
FSA and deterministic vs non-deterministic automata.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for alternative definitions of free will, I'm not very interested.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once you clear out the mystical means of choice, your choice is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer free but restricted by the confines of your brain and your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current mind state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Your choice is free within the confines of your being.  As 
<br>
alluded to earlier, a claim that free will only exist for beings 
<br>
that are unlimited is vacuous. At any moment in time any being 
<br>
that does not transcend time will be of only a fixed &quot;size&quot;. If 
<br>
we build an FAI and/or augmented indefinitely, precisely in what 
<br>
sense are we limited to the confines of our brain? For that 
<br>
matter don't you need to extent the decision making space to 
<br>
include other human beings (for starters)?  The brain itself 
<br>
either is or is not able to be modeled as a FSA.  Personally, I 
<br>
have my doubts that this model is workable.  It is or is not 
<br>
fully deterministic.  Again I have my doubts. Your current mind 
<br>
state is huge and capable of being influenced by literally 
<br>
millions of internal and external events in parallel with and 
<br>
without your conscious attention or intention.  So saying that 
<br>
we choose out of our current mind state is trivially true but 
<br>
probably not useful to the question.  How would we choose 
<br>
otherwise?  Utterly randomly?  That isn't what most people mean 
<br>
by free-will, common sense or otherwise.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That's it for tonight.  I have been kept up far too late with all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Independence Day fun that everyone managed to involve me in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I hear that.  I just got home from such fun a couple of hours 
<br>
ago myself.  I hope all in the US had a good one.
