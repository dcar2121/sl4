</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm pretty sure that Cyc's goal has been for a long time to be

</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably the common urge (as it would be with me) to first get

<em>&gt; it to affect the world.  And, of course, before taking that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last giant step, implementing friendliness would be necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your reordering of these priorities, if I understand you right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is most interesting, placing Friendliness first.  I'll probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to study your architecture to understand how friendliness
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Friendliness cannot arise in the absence of all understanding; &quot;you can 
<br>
only build Friendly AI out of whatever building blocks the AI is capable 
<br>
of understanding at that time&quot;.  The kind of understanding that both 
<br>
enables and *requires* Friendly AI content would probably come 
<br>
considerably before a strong understanding of our world, the one we 
<br>
chauvinistically and shortsightedly call &quot;real life&quot;.  Furthermore, for 
<br>
an FAI to read the massed moral writings of humanity and come to 
<br>
philosophical conclusions therefrom would require a structurally 
<br>
complete FAI architecture and a substantial amount of existing FAI content.
<br>
<p>I also agree that a Friendly AI would be wisest to hold off on making 
<br>
its own real-world plans in pursuit of long-term goals until it has a 
<br>
very strong understanding of the real world, and even though the AI 
<br>
might be able to be somewhat more confident by borrowing the judgement 
<br>
of the programmers, the programmers might be wise to avoid affecting the 
<br>
world too much until the AI is grown up.  But Friendliness is one of the 
<br>
foundations of a Friendly AI's general intelligence - it can't be 
<br>
slapped on afterward.  Building a Friendly AI as described in CFAI means 
<br>
building a general intelligence with certain structural semantics in the 
<br>
goal system.  You can no more build a general intelligence and add on 
<br>
Friendliness later than you can build a human-architecture brain 
<br>
newspapers and add on pleasure and pain later.
<br>
<p>Or you could add on Friendliness later, maybe, if the AI weren't already 
<br>
grown up to the point of being able to resist you, but it would be a 
<br>
major scramble in terms of rewriting code and recreating content and 
<br>
propagating changes and invalidating dependencies and so on.  There's 
<br>
just no reason to go there.  And an AI that can read and fully 
<br>
understand arbitrary newspapers or moral writings probably *is* grown up 
<br>
to the point of being able to resist you.
<br>
<p>Certain structural characteristics in a goal system architecture are 
<br>
necessary to understand the statement:  &quot;I built you, now please let me 
<br>
modify you.&quot;
