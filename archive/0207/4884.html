<p>I might agree with that general statement about wisdom vs intelligence,
<br>
except that it also takes significant time for the process to occur.
<br>
<p>Something along the lines of:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intelligence + knowledge/experience * time = wisdom
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Some people have only met &quot;intelligent&quot; people whose rationalization

<p>Ok, this I know is not the case (at least for myself).  I'm no genious
<br>
but there is a clear distinction betwee the way I think &amp; process
<br>
information and most other people.  This is obvious because it gets very
<br>
frustrating when most people just don't &quot;get it&quot; regularly.  This is why
<br>
I tend to associate mostly with smart people, so I definately don't
<br>
suffer from what you suggest.
<br>
<p>Yet I still maintain that &quot;Intelligence does not equal wisdom&quot;.  That is
<br>
because 10 years ago I was equally intelligent but, looking back, I was
<br>
much less wise.  It takes time and introspection to be able to see this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think, for the majority of cases, the human mind has had
<br>
sufficient experience by age ~20 to enable this.  In the late teens a
<br>
smart person probably has all the mental building blocks in place, but
<br>
having just gotten them properly assembled they have little run-time
<br>
experience with them.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The problem of discussing &quot;wisdom&quot; is that everyone's had at least a few
</em><br>
<em> &gt; thoughts they consider &quot;wise&quot;.  In many cases they've gone through a lot
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, I don't know that I would consider any one thought as wise.  More
<br>
like wisdom is the general quality of thought (but that isn't quite
<br>
right - I just can't come up with a better term at the moment).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; of hell to acquire whatever lesson they learned, and they really don't

<p>Some of us want, very much, to know if we learned the wrong lesson.
