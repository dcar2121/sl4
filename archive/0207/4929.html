<p>
I think I understand the argument of why SIAI wants to build an &quot;infant&quot; 
<br>
(so to speak) rather than a &quot;genome&quot; for its seed AI.
<br>
<p>As a separate issue, however, I am really nervous about how so few genes 
<br>
(some fraction of the 30,000 to 120,000 genes that are believed to exist 
<br>
in the human genome, by various estimates) can encode wiring algorithms 
<br>
for the many purported built-in modules of the brain that are supposed 
<br>
to exist under the Integrated Causal Model. Can anyone give, or point me 
<br>
to, a really satisfying hypothesis for this?
<br>
<p>It is not sufficient to point out the number of megabytes of data 
<br>
encoded in the raw DNA comprising these genes, as this is meaningless in 
<br>
and of itself. It is not enough merely to point out the notorious 
<br>
complexity of protein folding, at least without some good argument about 
<br>
&quot;how much&quot; of this complexity gives rise to the functional complexity we 
<br>
see in the mind (or any other organ). I guess what I'm really wondering 
<br>
is &quot;where&quot; in the genome we can expect to find the difference between 
<br>
one purported mental module and another, and how this encoding scheme is 
<br>
not hostile to the evolution of new mental modules by natural selection. 
<br>
Since we don't really know, can someone explain at least what we might 
<br>
expect an answer to this question to look like?
<br>
