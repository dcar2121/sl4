<p>James, this is pure slander.  I've stated before and will state again 
<br>
that the Sysop Scenario was one bright stupid idea that I sincerely wish 
<br>
I'd never come up with, since it seems to take over people's minds 
<br>
faster than a transhuman AI with a VT100 terminal.  The Sysop Scenario 
<br>
is the Singularitarian equivalent of the Sixties Syndrome or the 
<br>
Jetsons; futurism couched in human terms, easy to imagine and therefore 
<br>
probably flat wrong.
<br>
<p>What does matter, and does not change irrespective of whether the result 
<br>
of seed AI is a Sysop Scenario or the first very powerful transhuman 
<br>
helping the world make a smooth transition to a civilization of equally 
<br>
powerful transhumans, is whether the mind you build has *your own* goal 
<br>
system, or whether the result is the same mind that would be built by 
<br>
*any* AI project which shares the moral belief that the outcome of the 
<br>
Singularity shouldn't be made to depend on who implements it.  This 
<br>
holds true whether it works because of objective morality, or because of 
<br>
a &quot;subjective&quot; yet clearly widely shared belief that certain kinds of 
<br>
personal morality should *not* be transferred into the first transhuman 
<br>
AI.  I clearly spend a great deal of time worrying about this.  Ben, on 
<br>
the other hand, has stated in clear mathematical terms his intention to 
<br>
optimize the world according to his own personal goal system, yet you 
<br>
don't seem to worry about this at all.  I'm not trying to attack Ben, 
<br>
just pointing out that your priorities are insane.  Apparently you don't 
<br>
listen to what either Ben or I say.
<br>
<p>Oh, well.  I've been genuinely, seriously accused of trying to take over 
<br>
the world.  There probably aren't many people in the world who can put 
<br>
that on their CV.
