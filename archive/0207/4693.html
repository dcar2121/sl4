<p>JR&gt; Gordon is correct.  IF you assume the mind can be run on finite state
<br>
JR&gt; machinery (something one generally assumes in AI research), you can't have
<br>
JR&gt; free will.  Furthermore, in such a case it is mathematically impossible for
<br>
JR&gt; you to even perceive that you don't have free will (kind of like Godel's
<br>
JR&gt; theorem applied to computational machinery), though it is possible to
<br>
JR&gt; perceive the lack of &quot;free will&quot; in simpler machinery.  This last sentence
<br>
JR&gt; catches most people as a surprise.
<br>
<p>Actually, your first one catches me.  I wasn't aware that &quot;free will&quot;
<br>
or even &quot;consciousness&quot; were concepts amenable to any sort of formal
<br>
analysis...seeing as anybody would have a damned hard time defining
<br>
what they mean by these terms in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my perspective, it seems to me that I decide what to do.  Seen
</em><br>
from a pure physics perspective, obviously -- it would seem -- I
<br>
don't.  The laws of physics &quot;decide&quot;.  But this gets us into the whole
<br>
question of what the heck is really meant by deciding, by
<br>
consciousness, by terms such as free will, which can all get very
<br>
sticky.  Pragmatically though, I can decide (or, ehm, have the
<br>
illusion of deciding) to act /as if/ I have free will -- if it looks
<br>
like a duck, etc.
<br>
<p>There's some interesting (to me) analysis of the language around these
<br>
concepts in Smullyan's &quot;Is God a Taoist?&quot;, collected in Dennett and
<br>
Hofstadter's &quot;The Mind's I&quot;, and etext copies of which can be readily
<br>
Googled.
<br>
<p>JR&gt; A lot of people have a hard time with this concept because it isn't
<br>
JR&gt; intuitive, but it is relatively simple to show why it must necessarily be
<br>
JR&gt; true.  An SI may be able to observe that we do not have free will but we as
<br>
JR&gt; roughly equivalent individuals never can, so we've operated under the
<br>
JR&gt; assumption that we do have free will as a functional heuristic.  The
<br>
JR&gt; emergence of large intelligence differentials in observer entities will
<br>
JR&gt; shatter this illusion, which is really just a narrow boundary case when
<br>
JR&gt; applied to humans. 
<br>
<p>JR&gt; I've seen quite a bit of very irrational backlash against this idea because
<br>
JR&gt; it invalidates a core axiom of human interaction.  I've never seen anyone
<br>
JR&gt; actually refute it, they just get a &quot;deer in the headlights&quot; look and refuse
<br>
JR&gt; to accept it.  But this is SL4. :-)
<br>
<p>Well, you can't blame them as they obviously have no choice in the
<br>
matter (because, ehm, they don't have free will).  Wait...I take that
<br>
back.  Maybe you can and do blame them, in which case you cannot not
<br>
do so, lacking, as you do as well, free will.
<br>
<p>OK, I'm being facetious...where I'm going with this is that this whole
<br>
&quot;do or don't we have free will?&quot; question seems to me mostly a
<br>
semantic game.
<br>
<p>To wit: similarly, there can as a matter of principle never be, as far
<br>
as I can figure, a way to prove that consciousness exists, but I'm
<br>
perfectly happy pretending I'm conscious.
<br>
<p>In any case, to get this down to brass tacks -- let's say someone
<br>
gives you a One Free Answer From God coupon, and you get to settle,
<br>
once and for all, Whether Or Not we have free will.
<br>
<p>Say the answer is Yes.  What does that prove?  To what conclusions
<br>
does that lead?
<br>
<p>Same thing for No.
<br>
<p>In short, practically I'm not sure why or how it's any more an
<br>
important rather than semantical question over the old saw about the
<br>
tree falling in the forest.
