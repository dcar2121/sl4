<em>&gt; James, we live in the absolutely most interesting, terrifying, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant time in all of the history of the universe.  The Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is it!  If this had ever happened before, anywhere, we'd have heard 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it.  
</em><br>
<p><p>Really, no guarantees that we would have heard about it at all. 
<br>
Frankly, for all we know we are a transcendent SI remembering 
<br>
its own becoming.  From that POV we certainly would not hear 
<br>
about it as it is in our &quot;future&quot;. If the SI transcends time 
<br>
and/or  runs sims or VRs then there are many scenarios, where 
<br>
we, within such, would not know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nothing we could imagine could be as fascinating or as scary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as reality right now.  Never before have we had to concern ourselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with so many existential risks, some of which, risks not just for us but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for everything.  
</em><br>
<p>Like the old MAD days of the end of humanity?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And being on the cusp of changing literally everything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overnight, the immediate future is so unpredictable.  
</em><br>
<p>I think it is dangerous to hold this point of view except very 
<br>
carefully.  It can immobilize us for planning the immediate 
<br>
future to the degree we can and thus decrease the effectiveness 
<br>
of our lives.  It can be an equivalent to the millenium hysteria 
<br>
that the world is changing or radically altering on such a such 
<br>
date so why bother with normal long-term tasks?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; When I was a child 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had nightmares.  Now my dreams pale to boredom compared to real life.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something incredible is going to happen.  Some businessmen who have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become aware of the trends are wondering how to take advantage of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic opportunities.  They don't get it.  Everything we are familiar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with is going to be wiped away in an instant.  All of our institutions, 
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe not, or at least maybe not until some time from now 
<br>
- perhaps longer than you think, perhaps not.  Until then it 
<br>
behooves us to act as if there *is* a tomorrow.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; our culture, our way of life.  Even if it turns out infinitely good, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'cataclysmic' will still be an understatement.  Although personally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paranoid, I do not recommend fear.  While I myself expect the worst, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't rationally think a good outcome is unlikely.  There is no reason 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to panic, we are way past that.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, your statement isn't exactly conducive to much except 
<br>
panic or resignation to something or other making anything and 
<br>
everything we do utterly beside the point and probably not even 
<br>
in a good way.  Have a nice day. :-)   Surely we can come up 
<br>
with better than this.  If we don't the natives might attempt 
<br>
something drastic like a cultural revolution to eliminate those 
<br>
darned eggheads and their diabolical machines.
