</em><br>
<em>&gt;James, we live in the absolutely most interesting, terrifying, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant time in all of the history of the universe.  The Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is it!  If this had ever happened before, anywhere, we'd have heard about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it.  Nothing we could imagine could be as fascinating or as scary as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality right now.  Never before
</em><br>
<p>This small piece of time is definitely all those things.  But lets not get 
<br>
ahead of ourselves, we have no idea if this has happened before.  My 
<br>
personal opinion is that this type of thing has probably happened many 
<br>
times but that its usually cataclysmic.  Hell, as pointed out repeatedly we 
<br>
may just be simulations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;have we had to concern ourselves with so many existential risks, some of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which, risks not just for us but for everything.  And being on the cusp of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changing literally everything overnight, the immediate future is so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unpredictable.  When I was a child I had nightmares.  Now my dreams pale 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to boredom compared to real life.  Something incredible is going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happen.  Some businessmen who have become aware of the trends are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wondering how to take advantage of the economic opportunities.  They don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get it.  Everything we are familiar with is going to be wiped away in an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instant.  All of our institutions, our culture,
</em><br>
<p>Even if we don't get a Singularity this will be true.  Widespread 
<br>
availability of nano-technology will make the industrial base completely 
<br>
obsolete overnight.  Just this one aspect of the future would completely 
<br>
change everything.  The value structure of the entire world will transform 
<br>
overnight with very few things retaining much value.  The most valuable 
<br>
commodities post-nano will be raw materials (including land) and 
<br>
information.  Some level of service organizations may survive depending on 
<br>
how things go.
<br>
<p>No matter what path the future takes it will be quite something to see.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;our way of life.  Even if it turns out infinitely good, 'cataclysmic' will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;still be an understatement.  Although personally paranoid, I do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recommend fear.  While I myself expect the worst, I don't rationally think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a good outcome is unlikely.  There is no reason to panic, we are way past that.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not at all convinced that a good outcome is likely (I suspect the 
<br>
opposite is true).  However, I don't see that humanity has much 
<br>
choice.  The nature of man is such that we will continue to progress.  Even 
<br>
if all technology was destroyed today humans will either eventually reach 
<br>
the point of no return or will be destroyed by other means.  I am hopeful 
<br>
that everything will turn out ok, though.
<br>
<p>James
