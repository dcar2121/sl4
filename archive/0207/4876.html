<em> &gt;&gt; Um, what else do you think Eliezer IS trying to do if not take over the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; that is obviously his goal.  His previously stated goal is to initiate
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; the Sysop which would, by proxy, take over the world.  He states that
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; this is to help all people on the Earth, but it is still him taking over
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; the world for his own purposes.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; James, this is pure slander.  I've stated before and will state again
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that the Sysop Scenario was one bright stupid idea that I sincerely wish
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, I did not intend it as such.  I believe what I wrote to be
<br>
factual, please note that I did not specify what your motives are.  You
<br>
are in effect attempting to take over the world via an SI.  This could
<br>
be a very good thing, depending on how your implementation turns out.  I
<br>
apologize if you took that as an insult or such.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I'd never come up with, since it seems to take over people's minds
</em><br>
<em> &gt; faster than a transhuman AI with a VT100 terminal.  The Sysop Scenario
</em><br>
<em> &gt; is the Singularitarian equivalent of the Sixties Syndrome or the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Jetsons; futurism couched in human terms, easy to imagine and therefore
</em><br>
<em> &gt; probably flat wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Even if the SI doesn't actually take over the world (as in locking down
<br>
all matter) it will be able to control the world due to its vastly
<br>
superior intellect.  So, sysop or not, it is still taking over the world
<br>
so to speak.  The difference (in my oppinion) would be that the Sysop
<br>
scenario would provide a nice, comfy cell for all intellects where a SI
<br>
that didn't take full control could just be a helper.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; What does matter, and does not change irrespective of whether the result
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of seed AI is a Sysop Scenario or the first very powerful transhuman
</em><br>
<em> &gt; helping the world make a smooth transition to a civilization of equally
</em><br>
<em> &gt; powerful transhumans, is whether the mind you build has *your own* goal
</em><br>
<em> &gt; system, or whether the result is the same mind that would be built by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; *any* AI project which shares the moral belief that the outcome of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Singularity shouldn't be made to depend on who implements it.  This
</em><br>
<em> &gt; holds true whether it works because of objective morality, or because of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a &quot;subjective&quot; yet clearly widely shared belief that certain kinds of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; personal morality should *not* be transferred into the first transhuman
</em><br>
<em> &gt; AI.  I clearly spend a great deal of time worrying about this.  Ben, on
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the other hand, has stated in clear mathematical terms his intention to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; optimize the world according to his own personal goal system, yet you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; don't seem to worry about this at all.  I'm not trying to attack Ben,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; just pointing out that your priorities are insane.  Apparently you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; don't listen to what either Ben or I say.
</em><br>
<p>For the record, I worry about all manner of things when it comes to the
<br>
Singularity, Nanotech, or the like.  I also listen very closely to what
<br>
both you and Ben say.
<br>
<p>This isn't the place to get into the details but having conversed with
<br>
you and Ben for awhile I believe he is significantly wiser than you (not
<br>
necessarily more intelligent).  Nothing personal, but your ~20 and
<br>
virtually all people that age are full of themselves.  It is a
<br>
perspective that changes with experience and, I believe, allows a person
<br>
to make significantly better judgements.  I've said this before, but
<br>
I'll repeat it here, over the next 5-15 years you will mature, gain
<br>
wisdom and shift your perspectives.  Hopefully in 10 years time I'll be
<br>
as comfortable with your decisions as I am now with Ben's (which is far
<br>
from 100% - btw).
<br>
<p>Eliezer, please don't take this personally.  You agree that a person
<br>
can't think like, or fully understand the thinking of, a person more
<br>
intelligent than themselves.  Well, I believe that in addition a person
<br>
can't understand things in the same way as a person who has more life
<br>
experience (is wiser) than themselves.  Pretty much everyone becomes
<br>
wiser with age (some more than others, obviously).  Assuming you don't
<br>
keep yourself locked in a closet thinking about the Singularity then
<br>
I'll bet you that 10 years from now you'll agree with this statement.  I
<br>
sincerely wish I could just explain/teach this to you but,
<br>
unfortunately, you just can't start to see over that hill until you've
<br>
climbed it for awhile.  And I expect that my perspective will also
<br>
change and mature over the next 10 years (it is a continual process -
<br>
unless you intentionally isolate yourself from it).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Oh, well.  I've been genuinely, seriously accused of trying to take over
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the world.  There probably aren't many people in the world who can put
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that on their CV.
</em><br>
<p>The way I intended it is that, essentially, anyone working on a seed AI
<br>
or the Singularity would qualify.  Of course, that is still a very small
<br>
group of people...
