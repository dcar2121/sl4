<p>Yes, to some degree.  I'm quite certain not nearly as much as you have
<br>
(you get paid to think about this stuff - after all).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; yours?  Have you sat down and really thought about how *you* would

<p>Do I think I could win in which role?  Frankly, without using meta
<br>
tricks I don't think any human today playing the role of an AI could
<br>
convince a reasonably intelligent person to let them out, assuming the
<br>
individual was determined to keep them in the box.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; someone to guard an AI, would you choose someone who said &quot;I can't

<p>I don't think it would help much at all, either way.  I'd prefer to pick
<br>
the individuals involved by other criteria.  Such as their goals,
<br>
integrity, honesty, intelligence, knowledge and understanding of the
<br>
topic and its importance, etc.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; transhuman AI, but I'm asking what you would do.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't know what I'd do.  Having thought about it previously I
<br>
don't think I would ever be able to convince myself to let the AI out of
<br>
the box prematurly.  Since I can't think like anyone other than myself I
<br>
can't think of a good way to get another person to let the AI out of the
<br>
box.  Now, given someone that didn't fully understand the situation and
<br>
its importance or wasn't dedicated to keeping the AI in the box,
<br>
certainly I could find ways to succeed.
