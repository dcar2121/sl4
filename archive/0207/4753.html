At least he does not ignore obvious mathematical facts. I don't know 
<br>
whether he is right, but I think
<br>
sloppy reasoning is much better than merely emotional attitudes. (i.e. 
<br>
yours) I don't believe
<br>
anyone on this list (or at all) could rule out the possibility that 
<br>
Penrose could be right.
<br>
<p>I also think the Chinese room analogy should not be treated as a 
<br>
complete nonsense. It is
<br>
not a strict argument, but, for me, an intuitive hint, that 
<br>
consciousness may have more substance
<br>
than it appears at the first sight.
<br>
<p>There is some mystical about self-consciousness (if you meditate about 
<br>
it  a bit),
<br>
there is some mystical about quantum mechanics (if you think abbout it a 
<br>
bit)
<br>
and there is strong link between these two (phase reduction).
<br>
I agree that the reasoning of Penrose is not convincing, because it is 
<br>
not founded.
<br>
I've got the impression that he simply tries to find an explanation how 
<br>
these appearently
<br>
related things (self-consciousness and QM) are really connected. Perhaps 
<br>
he is wrong in the
<br>
details, but there is a good chance that he's got the correct overall 
<br>
intuition.
<br>
<p>My point : It is not a correct to say that argument A must be wrong 
<br>
since it is similar to
<br>
the wrong statement B (vitalism in your case). This leads to nowhere.
<br>
<p>Best regards, Chrtistian
