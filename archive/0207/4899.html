</em><br>
<em> &gt; the same underlying machinery.  It is sort of like the old &quot;book
</em><br>
<em> &gt; smart&quot;/&quot;street smart&quot; dichotomy.  Intelligence still manifests itself
</em><br>
<em> &gt; quite clearly even in the absence of formal education in some field, but
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it tends to look qualitatively different.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;book smart&quot; and &quot;street smart&quot; have very different conotations and do
<br>
not refer to the same thing.  A person who is &quot;book smart&quot; is likely to
<br>
be good at something (like science, writing, software development, etc)
<br>
but would likely get themselves killed if they were walking around the
<br>
wrong part of town.  On the other hand, someone who is &quot;street smart&quot;
<br>
could probably conduct business in the wrong part of town but may not be
<br>
able to do any of the things the &quot;book smart&quot; individual would be
<br>
successful at.
<br>
<p>Wisdom and Intelligence also have very different conotations.  A very
<br>
intelligent person could do something that many would consider unwise
<br>
and land in jail or get killed.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I really don't understand why people would think these are the
<br>
same thing.  It is like saying night is the same as day, which in the
<br>
cosmic sense is true but here on earth they are very different things.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; BTW, having personally known a number of &quot;Native American Indian Chiefs&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in real life, I must say that their wisdom is mostly a mythological
</em><br>
<em> &gt; construct; the egregious lack of wisdom and judgment exhibited by most
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;Native Americans&quot; should make this patently obvious.  What is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; interpreted as &quot;wisdom&quot; is really just the New Age artsy sound of their
</em><br>
<em> &gt; languages when interpreted literally rather than semantically.
</em><br>
<p>Just to clarify, I personally never mentioned anything about such
<br>
things.  I think attributing wisdom to any one class of individual is a
<br>
fallacy.  I'm also not mythological in my thinking.  So, in my view,
<br>
Wisdom has nothing to do with such things.
