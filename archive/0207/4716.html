<p>
Regarding &quot;free will&quot;, I don't attach all that much meaning to this concept,
<br>
personally.
<br>
<p>Sometimes it pays to remind ourselves that linguistic terms have meanings
<br>
agreed upon by social convention.  They are tokens which we have found
<br>
valuable to communicate amongst ourselves in certain contexts.  Sometimes
<br>
terms/concepts are useful for a while and then become less useful.
<br>
<p>There are many examples -- for instance why was &quot;hysteria&quot; such a common
<br>
psychiatric diagnosis for among women 100 years ago, but is unheard of now?
<br>
Have womens' mental states changed with changes in culture?  To some extent.
<br>
Have we just started classifying things in a different way?  Largely.
<br>
<p>There is no such thing as a crisply defined concept of &quot;free will.&quot;  What we
<br>
have is a series of two words which people have used in various ways in
<br>
various contexts.  The degree of consensus as to the meaning of a term like
<br>
this is much smaller than one finds regarding terms like &quot;table&quot; or
<br>
&quot;integrated circuit&quot; or even &quot;headache&quot; (though the latter has a lot of
<br>
variety too).
<br>
<p>All in all, any debate about whether this or that entity has free will that
<br>
does not begin with a fairly precise definition of &quot;free will&quot; seems to me
<br>
unlikely to lead anywhere interesting....  There is too much ambiguity here
<br>
to lead to anything but poetry, speculative metaphysics, and meandering
<br>
e-mails or conversations ;)
<br>
<p>To me, &quot;free will&quot; is most meaningful as a psychological feeling -- a state
<br>
of mind in which one feels in some sense responsible for making autonomous
<br>
decisions.  This feeling -- this flavor of experience -- is what it is,
<br>
regardless of scientific theories about the deterministic or
<br>
nondeterministic underpinnings of the mind doing the experiencing.
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gordon is correct.  IF you assume the mind can be run on finite state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; machinery (something one generally assumes in AI research), you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This looks tantamount to claiming that only an utterly unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being could have free will.  Oh, wait, we are, afaik, capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going beyond our biological limits.  Either way, you lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it is not a question of mathematics at all.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can choose among alternatives, even if the alternatives are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite, you have free will.  Espcially if you can modify your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value and goal structures to some extent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Furthermore, in such a case it is mathematically impossible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you to even perceive that you don't have free will (kind of like Godel's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theorem applied to computational machinery), though it is possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perceive the lack of &quot;free will&quot; in simpler machinery.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last sentence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; catches most people as a surprise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then how do you know it?  hmm?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A lot of people have a hard time with this concept because it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intuitive, but it is relatively simple to show why it must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then show it instead of simply asserting it.  Start with your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of &quot;free will&quot; and go from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I've seen quite a bit of very irrational backlash against this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it invalidates a core axiom of human interaction.  I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually refute it, they just get a &quot;deer in the headlights&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look and refuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to accept it.  But this is SL4. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, now any questioning of your bald assertions will be taken as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;irrational backlash&quot;.  Sigh.
