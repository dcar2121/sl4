<p>As I understand it, genes are more like a set of arguments passed into a 
<br>
Human Making Machine.  You tell it to give it these properties and 
<br>
those, and out comes pretty much what you asked for.  This is a 
<br>
reasonable means by which evolution can work:  genes store the variables 
<br>
and the best genes, over time, are the ones that get put in a Human 
<br>
Making Machine most often (of course the Machine changes since it's 
<br>
inside of a human and evolution can take place with just that).
<br>
<p>This is somewhat similar (not the same) as the way Ben has mentioned he 
<br>
tweaks his AI:  he has a set of variables that he can play with while 
<br>
the rest of the mind is created automatically via some formula.  The 
<br>
problem from his perspective, just like it is in human evolution, once 
<br>
you've got the AI Making Machine you have to pass in the right variables 
<br>
to get a good AI.
