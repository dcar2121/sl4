[I just joined this list.  Rather than a separate JOIN message,
<br>
I'll just briefly state I've been reading/thinking about the
<br>
Singularity and related subjects ever since reading Vinge, and have
<br>
been a technophile/neophile as far back as I can remember.  I also
<br>
have opinions/ideas for AI that I haven't seen elsewhere -- which is
<br>
not to say they haven't been thought of before by others.  In any
<br>
case, what follows is IA, not AI, related.]
<br>
<p>I recently came across this article, which meshes/overlaps some
<br>
thoughts I've had on Intelligence Enhancement:
<br>
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1932000/1932709.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1932000/1932709.stm</a>
<br>
<p>It's a very brief outline, and I haven't tracked the actual scientists
<br>
and papers behind it, but the basic idea seems to be using
<br>
transcranial magnetic stimulation of some sort to 'activate' the right
<br>
brain, and with it some skills shared by some autistic people.
<br>
However, as with so many science &quot;stories&quot; in mainstream media, the
<br>
headline is a lot more enticing than the body of the article, which
<br>
in this case indicates they've used it only to improve drawing skills
<br>
(which a two hour session using lessons from the book Drawing on the
<br>
Right Side of the Brain could probably achieve just as nicely).  I'd
<br>
be more interested in the full range of skills displayed by &quot;idiot
<br>
savants&quot;.
<br>
<p>In any case: having experimented with psychedelic drugs in my past and
<br>
experienced what seemed like enhanced mental acuity in certain areas;
<br>
and being interested in &quot;willed&quot; as well as technologically achieved
<br>
brain change; and having dreamed about superpowers since reading
<br>
comics, and mental superpowers since reading Dune as a boy -- I've
<br>
long wondered if it's possible to acquire savant-level skills in math,
<br>
drawing, instant-counting, etc.
<br>
<p>Such powers clearly appear to be inherent possibilities of the brain;
<br>
perhaps there are evolutionary reasons why their appearance in the
<br>
general population has not occurred -- but if the potential for these
<br>
skills exists in our brains, shouldn't we be trying to unlock it?
<br>
<p>Is anybody aware of research -- whether based on technology, Lilly's
<br>
&quot;metaprogramming&quot; via drugs, Crowleyan &quot;willed brain change&quot;, or for
<br>
that matter any method or combination of methods -- that's been done
<br>
in this direction?
<br>
<p>[I took a brief gander at some of the archived messages here and
<br>
didn't offhand see any discussion of this; if I missed any, kindly
<br>
link.]
