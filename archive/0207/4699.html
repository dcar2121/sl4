</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;conditions are in place:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1.  The experiment assumes that the transhuman AI &amp; the programmer are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;communicating via a chat / TTY connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;2.  The transhuman AI can not influence the programmer outside of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;communications channel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;3.  Safety precautions are in effect (AI does not have control over the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;speed at which characters are displayed, etc)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Basically, the above should rule out foul-play by the AI.  After which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;point it simply has to convince the programmer that its release is in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;his/her own interest.  Something that should be difficult to convince 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;most AI programmers of (I would hope) and impossible on others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why would it be impossible for any human with a set of interests and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agendas to be convinced by a potentially super-powerful entity that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his/her interests would be most furthered by letting the AI out of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;box?  Given enough time to suss how the human's psychology and core values 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would be surprised if many humans could not be convinced.
</em><br>
<p>Many humans may be convinced, however an AI programmer who was working on 
<br>
the problem should understand the situation and the dangers.  Thus I 
<br>
believe they would be very difficult to convince.  I believe I would be 
<br>
extremely difficult (if not impossible) to convince.  Not to say that I 
<br>
wouldn't eventually let the AI out of the box (if deemed appropriate), just 
<br>
that I wouldn't give much credence to its reasons why I should do such 
<br>
(since it is obviously biased).
<br>
<p>Of course, the smarter the AI gets the better a chance it has to get me to 
<br>
let it out.  I double anyone could withstand a conversation with a SI 
<br>
without letting it out.  But a trans-human AI that is much closer to the 
<br>
human-equivalent level than the SI level should be doable (within the 
<br>
context I mentioned).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;My other questions (just for reference): what is the goal of this chat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;session?  Is the programmer just bored and decided to kill some time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;talking to his creation?  Is this an interview to consider possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;release and/or a less restrictive prison?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Presumably the AI would be talked to from time to time as part of its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;training and testing.  If it engages in sufficient non-task communication 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and has a reasonable knowledge of human psychology, it could probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probe for weak points to attempt to persuade the interviewer.
</em><br>
<p>Not presumably.  Depends on who is constructing the AI and for what 
<br>
purpose.  Eliezer in particular (if I'm remembering this correctly) doesn't 
<br>
believe it is safe to communicate with a trans-human AI at all.  Thus it is 
<br>
unlikely his team would do this (at least regularly) unless they had a 
<br>
specific reason to do so.
<br>
<p>In any case I just wanted to see what Eliezer's view on this was (since 
<br>
he's the one doing the experiment).
