<p>Time is involved, but not in the sense you're thinking.  Time is 
<br>
important in the &quot;I can only think so fast&quot; sense, not the &quot;I've been 
<br>
around the world and back again&quot; sense.  You are only thinking about 
<br>
accumulating wisdom the hard way:  you do the wrong thing and try to 
<br>
formulate a negative to that which is right.  The `easy' way (this kind 
<br>
of thinking it's really easy, just the process is easier and faster than 
<br>
the hard way) is to be able to think rationally and reason your way to 
<br>
wise choices.  As it turns out, this way gets more right answers faster 
<br>
(still limited by time in the sense that I mentioned).  The equation you 
<br>
proposed should look more like this (in Smalltalk/Obj-C like syntax):
<br>
<p>wisdom = [your_mind intelligentThoughtWithKnowledge: your_knowledge 
<br>
experience: (your_experience + vicarious_experience) forTime: t];
<br>
<p>:-)
<br>
<p>The only issue with time is spending time thinking about things that, 
<br>
upon drawing conclusions, will make you wiser.
<br>
<p>To be fair, though, I obtain wisdom both ways.
<br>
<p>As for this being adolescent egoism, I don't think there's much that can 
<br>
be said to dissuade you of that position.  I understand why you think 
<br>
that way, but it's wrong to think that wisdom is necessarily correlated 
<br>
with age, though it often is.  As Eli suggested, demonstrating wisdom 
<br>
goes a lot further than claiming to be wise towards proving wiseness to 
<br>
someone (of course if you're wise enough you know that it doesn't matter 
<br>
what most people think of you and act on it, but I digress).
