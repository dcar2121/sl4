<p>Just because you have the knowledge doesn't mean you'll find the 
<br>
wisdom.  Plenty of wealthy Englishmen in the 19th Century traveled 
<br>
around the world to exotic places and met lots of different people.  
<br>
And, by my recounting of history, they didn't learn much of anything 
<br>
other than that they really were more advanced than everyone else and 
<br>
then reckoned that they had all the more right to be snobs.
<br>
<p>I agree, though, that you need the knowledge to start getting wiser 
<br>
(though the more intelligent you are, the less knowledge you need).  
<br>
Also, some knowledge is worth more than other knowledge.  For example, 
<br>
knowledge of evolutionary psychology is worth a lot more than experience 
<br>
interacting with people when your trying to model how a normative human 
<br>
would act so that you can make wise decisions in your interactions with 
<br>
people, though to be fair you need to have some experience with people 
<br>
if you even hope to have the skills to use your wisdom.
<br>
<p>I am of the opinion that you can only gain wisdom by accident until you 
<br>
are a rational thinker, at which point you have the potential to see 
<br>
around your brain and find the right answers.
