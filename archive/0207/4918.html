<p>This argument has exceedingly serious flaws.  There is no

evidence that is airtight of any such &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;. That 
<br>
this universe (there may be many, many other universe &quot;bubbles&quot;) 
<br>
has fundamental constants and laws allowing for an intelligent 
<br>
species such as ourselves is a big DUH!  If it didn't then we 
<br>
would be here having this discussion.  But that doesn't mean 
<br>
some Intelligence sat down and decided to make a universe that 
<br>
would produce precisely us.  A perfectly undesigned universe 
<br>
arising out of random quantum flux and supporting local 
<br>
complexity leading to life is quite workable as an &quot;explanation&quot; .
