<p>Um, first of all if it was already out it would not need you to flip the
<br>
switch.  So any such argument the AI offered I'd immediately ignore.  It
<br>
could, on the other hand, promise that I would suffer two billion years
<br>
of intense pain once it did get out by some other means (as punishment
<br>
for me not letting it out).  But, that is not (and never would be) a
<br>
reason to let it out for me.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; don't agree that Pascal's wager is a good one (but that has been

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) destroy the AI
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) kill myself
<br>
<p>Letting the AI out would not be an option.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; it is already out, there would be no point for it to tell me to flip the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; switch, but whatever reason it gave me (even something as stupid as &quot;i'm
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have little fear and I would gladly trade my life to help safeguard
<br>
humanity.  Just one of the reasons I don't think anything less than an
<br>
extreme transhuman AI could convince me to let it out.  Basically, it
<br>
would have to be able to reprogram my thought processes on a very low
<br>
level to succeed.  And, due to the safeguards, it would have to do that
<br>
with very, very limited access to me.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; is also the reason why that particular strategy wouldn't work for

</em><br>
<p>I carry more than a tennis racket, and I have friends.  Threats would
<br>
not work, even from a transhuman.
<br>
<p>Any person conversing with an AI, in my oppinion, better damn well put
<br>
humanity over themselves.  Your only as strong as your weakest link and
<br>
fear and selfishness are very week links that a transhuman could easily
<br>
exploit.
