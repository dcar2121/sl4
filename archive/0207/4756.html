<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I mostly agree with Chalmers' criticism of Penrose's consciousness-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;must-be-quantum argument (section 3) and of his Gödel-based argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against AI (section 1).  Not sure yet what I think about Chalmers'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opinions, in section 2, about Penrose's second, neglected Gödel-type
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think the Goedel-type arguments are neglected, because they are mostly
<br>
uninteresting. To me, using  Goedels theorem and its variants to
<br>
speculate about the capabilities or limititations of AIs are simply naive
<br>
and completely miss the points. While they are mathematically accurate,
<br>
seldom practically related to the real problems of consciousness and GAI.
<br>
I find those argumentations mainly boring, much more boring than the
<br>
mathematicall uninteresting but inuitively challenging thought-experiment
<br>
of Searle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To me, it reeks of the rhetorical technique Jacque Vallee has called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the &quot;transitivity of strangeness&quot;: my evidence for strange fact 1 --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I've had contact with aliens -- is strange fact 2: watch me bend this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spoon with the Mind Power they taught me.  This type of argument can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be surprisingly effective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The transitivity of strangeness can lead to obviously nonsense.
<br>
but I have the exprience that it can lead to very interesting results if
<br>
1) Both weird things are really unexplainable by standard methods,
<br>
2) They share something common.
<br>
None of them applies to your analogy.
<br>
In mathematics, it is often a very powerful way of thinking. Sometimes 
<br>
it turns
<br>
out to be incorrect, but there are cases where it yields very powerful 
<br>
ideas.
<br>
I would say, the most interesting things in mathematics are discovered 
<br>
by the
<br>
method you called &quot;transitivity of strangeness.&quot;
<br>
<p>The interesting thing about the phase reduction (a very poorly 
<br>
understood phenomen)
<br>
that, so far, it assumes an observer, i.e. some conscious being 
<br>
performing the
<br>
measurement. I think that the weird think about self-consciousness is 
<br>
also the
<br>
fact that there is an observer at all. So to say, the &quot;integrity&quot; of the 
<br>
observer is one of
<br>
the its key problems. So if you think about it a bit, then the
<br>
unsolved parts of S-C and QM seems to be quite related. It may be a mere 
<br>
coincidence
<br>
or illusion, maybe the whole point of view is screwed, but it is at 
<br>
least not clear.
