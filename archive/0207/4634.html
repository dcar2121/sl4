<p>
To supply another data point in this discussion, I was raised Mormon and
<br>
know entirely too much about this particular/peculiar subset of
<br>
Christianity.  On the issue of whether AGI could become a convert, a certain
<br>
doctrinal dichotomy comes into play.  On the one hand, knowledge of God's
<br>
existence seems to be confirmed to an individual only through spiritual
<br>
senses (on this point I remained stuck my entire life until finally
<br>
abandoning the pursuit).  But on the other, there is the ingrained
<br>
scriptural idea that &quot;All things denote there is a God.&quot;  Everything that
<br>
happens, therefore, can be seen as evidence of God's handiwork -- or as
<br>
Satan's handiwork that happens to be permitted by God because it ultimately
<br>
serves His purpose. (Satan knows the truth but chooses rebellion.)  One
<br>
might see this religion, then, as supplying a simple perceptual filter to
<br>
the converted one.  Think of them as God-tinted glasses.  There are no
<br>
contradictions between empirical evidence and Mormon faith -- just a
<br>
colossal series of roundabout miracles, works, trials, etc contributing to
<br>
the Divine Plan.
<br>
<p>If Eliezer does, as he often postulates, get hit by a truck, it could be the
<br>
consequence of any of the following, all of which are potentially valid
<br>
reasons according to Mormon thought:
<br>
<p>--His time was up.
<br>
--He was so good that there was no point in him being on earth any more, and
<br>
he was carried home to his Creator.
<br>
--He had some sort of urgent work to do &quot;on the other side.&quot;
<br>
--He was going to commit some evil towards someone God decided to protect in
<br>
that particular way on that particular occasion.
<br>
--God didn't want him to develop AGI.
<br>
--Satan didn't want him to develop AGI (but God will have a backup plan
<br>
somewhere to show everyone how clever He is -- Ben's been ready for a
<br>
while...).
<br>
--Someone was supposed to prevent it, and could have if they had listened to
<br>
the Spirit, but didn't and is thus being taught a lesson. (God will make it
<br>
up to Eliezer though, and the stubborn person may yet become a pillar of
<br>
faith...)
<br>
--Some evil person was responsible: God knew this person was evil inside,
<br>
but allowed this person to express this evil so that He would be justified
<br>
in punishing the person for it.  (Eliezer will again be compensated if he
<br>
wasn't already due...)
<br>
--Eliezer was evil, and God was hiding this abomination from before his
<br>
eyes, as He is known to do from time to time when things get really ugly.
<br>
--Some member of Eliezer's family was meant to be touched by his death in a
<br>
way that will cause them to seek the Truth and become eligible for
<br>
salvation, and to perform the rites that make Eliezer posthumously eligible
<br>
as well.
<br>
--Eliezer was evil, and on the verge of doing even more evil, and God
<br>
decided he had enough evidence and slew him in an act of mercy, lest Eliezer
<br>
be subject to even more cosmically unpreventable punishment.
<br>
<p>There are more potential reasons that I can't think of at the moment, but it
<br>
should be apparent that a highly intelligent AGI should have no trouble
<br>
finding valid interpretations for each and every empirical perception that
<br>
would put it in harmony with God's Plan as described by the Mormon faith.
<br>
But naturally, there would be no rational reason to do this unless it had
<br>
acquired a Testimony of the Gospel through non-empirical means -- perceived
<br>
&quot;evidence of things not seen.&quot; -- which I guess is another one of those Zen
<br>
things creeping up in diverse religions...  So chalk up another point under
<br>
&quot;Religious folk see AGI as needing non-empirical perception to arrive at
<br>
ultimate truth.&quot;
<br>
