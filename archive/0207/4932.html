<p>Rafal,
<br>
<p>You have a good point; my reply was overly hasty and I didn't necessarily
<br>
fully understand the argument being profferred (as it was provided only as a
<br>
hint, not a fully argument).
<br>
<p>I have often seen arguments of the form &quot;No finite system can fully know
<br>
itself, because then it would have to fully know not only itself but also
<br>
its knowledge of itself, etc. ... leading to an infinite regress.&quot;  In other
<br>
words, no finite system can embody &quot;X, I know X, I know I know X, I know I
<br>
know I know X, ... &quot; forever, it has to stop somewhere, hence there has to
<br>
be some Y so that it knows Y, but doesn't know it knows Y.
<br>
<p>I consider this a weak argument because it only argues against absolute
<br>
self-knowledge.  It doesn't show that a system can't have 99.99%
<br>
self-knowledge.
<br>
<p>However,  there is another possible argument why an intelligent system can't
<br>
have even 99.99% self-knowledge or anywhere near.  This is the argument
<br>
you've posed: an intelligent system is going to be a complex,
<br>
hard-to-predict system, so that even if a system knows almost its whole
<br>
state at a given time, the small bit it doesn't know can lead to a great
<br>
amount of ignorance going forward, due to chaos-theory-style &quot;sensitive
<br>
dependence on initial conditions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Adding this onto the first argument, I guess the package does become more
<br>
convincing!  Though it's still just an heuristic argument, of course.
<br>
<p>In my own AI work, it is intuitively apparent that a Novamente AI system
<br>
will never have anywhere near complete self-knowledge (at least not until it
<br>
has revised itself into something hugely different than the current design)
<br>
