</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A:  It has become cliché on SL4 to say that intelligence does not equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wisdom.  Many of us have been well aware of this for quite some time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Please, avoid pointing this out unless the alternative is being drawn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and quartered (and maybe not even then).  This is also a rather silly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing to say, since for all you know greater intelligence *does* equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greater wisdom. With humans we get the opinion that the two are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uncorrelated, but the sample is too small to make non trivial factual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statements about greater intelligences (aside from the errors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extrapolation).
</em><br>
<p>OK, you have pushed me into spending 10 minutes trying to clarify the issue.
<br>
<p>First of all, let's be clear: this is an argument about the relationship
<br>
between two human-language concepts, &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot;, neither of
<br>
which  may be of any fundamental significance in the cosmos.
<br>
<p>To explore the relationship between these two terms it may help to
<br>
explicitly define the terms.
<br>
<p>First, &quot;Intelligence&quot; I understand as &quot;the ability to achieve complex goals
<br>
in complex environments.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is clear, and species-independent (though assessments of complexity may
<br>
be subjective).  Others may have different definitions of intelligence, but
<br>
at least I have one that satisfies *me*.
<br>
<p>I don't have a similarly crisp and satisfying definition of wisdom, but I'll
<br>
try to fabricate one for you this fine morning ;)
<br>
<p>Let's start with Dictionary.com, which says wisdom is
<br>
<p>***
<br>
1. The quality of being wise; knowledge, and the capacity to make due use of
<br>
it; knowledge of the best ends and the best means; discernment and judgment;
<br>
discretion; sagacity; skill; dexterity.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>n 1: accumulated knowledge or erudition or enlightenment 2: the trait of
<br>
utilizing knowledge and experience with common sense and insight [syn:
<br>
wiseness] [ant: folly] 3: ability to apply knowledge or experience or
<br>
understanding or common sense and insight [syn: sapience] 4: the quality of
<br>
being prudent and sensible [syn: wiseness, soundness]
<br>
***
<br>
<p><p>According to this, wisdom is a mixture of
<br>
<p>a) practical real-life intelligence, not just intelligence about narrow
<br>
abstract domains
<br>
b) knowledge
<br>
c) &quot;prudence&quot;, i.e. being relatively risk-averse
<br>
<p>So, we come down to wisdom as
<br>
<p>a) practical real-life intelligence, i.e. the ability to achieve complex
<br>
goals in complex &quot;practical, real-life&quot; situations
<br>
b) abstract knowledge that pertains to practical real-life intelligence
<br>
c) being relatively risk-averse
<br>
<p>If we accept this, then we conclude that intelligence does not imply wisdom
<br>
for at least two reasons:
<br>
<p>1) intelligence, generally considered, doesn't have to be practical; it can
<br>
be intelligence mostly about math and music and metacyberhagiography, rather
<br>
than about domains considered &quot;practical&quot; (where of course the judgment of
<br>
practicality is subjective...)
<br>
<p>2) one can be intelligent yet highly oriented toward risk-taking
<br>
<p>My conclusion is that intelligence just doesn't equal wisdom, as a matter of
<br>
definition.  Whether the mind is superintelligent or otherwise.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, wisdom does imply intelligence.  (Though a mind may be
<br>
wiser than it is intelligent.)
<br>
<p>I stress, finally, that, these concepts &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot; are not
<br>
necessarily all that important in the grand scheme of things, in analyzing
<br>
future technologies, etc.
<br>
<p>Gordon, when you say
<br>
<p><em>&gt; for all you know greater intelligence *does* equal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  greater wisdom
</em><br>
<p>I have to ask you how you are defining &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;wisdom&quot;.  And
<br>
please clarify how your definitions relate to the standard English
<br>
definitions of these terms as found in the dictionary.
