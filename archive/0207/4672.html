<em>&gt;Hmmm.  Actually, science could be perfectly right and there could still be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intuition that was not from merely subconscious processing within the 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>A more likely cause (in my book at least) would stem from quantum 
<br>
mechanics.  I'm defiantly no expect on this stuff but the little I do know 
<br>
about is pretty amazing.  For instance, you can tangle 2 quantum particles 
<br>
together and they will then maintain exactly opposite states (switch one 
<br>
and the other switches).  Then you can move these particles a very long 
<br>
distance and they still have this effect, and it is virtually instantaneous 
<br>
(ie: I believe can be faster than light).
<br>
<p>There have been theories that general intelligence my rely on quantum 
<br>
computing.  If nothing else it seems reasonable that our brains could 
<br>
contain a number of quantum particles that are somehow entangled with 
<br>
others (not in our brain).  Quite possibly with particles in other people's 
<br>
brains.  I've never believed in ESP and the like, but this could actually 
<br>
provide a scientific method for such things to occur.  Thus this 
<br>
&quot;intuition&quot; you speak of could be our subconscious detecting various 
<br>
patterns in its entangled particles.
<br>
<p>Then again, quantum mechanics in all its complexity and oddity could simply 
<br>
be our interpretation of bleed over from the underlying computational 
<br>
matrix of our VR universe.
