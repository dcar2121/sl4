<em>&gt; A thought exercise carried out from time to time among my co-workers at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cycorp is to imagine an AI that can read.  Consider how and if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast IP tied up in text can be protected from a non-human yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent reader.  Discard for a moment the difficulties of scanning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and OCR - assume them solved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1.  Does copyright keep an AI from perceiving, understanding and making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of the knowledge content of a book?  We think not but have not reached the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where we need a lawyer or court test.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that ultimately the only workable approach is to make 
<br>
most types of information part of an information commons. 
<br>
Certainly this is much more doable and many times more useful in 
<br>
the digital age.  Copyright is not on the knowledge content of a 
<br>
book but on that particular embodiment of content as I 
<br>
understand it.  IANAL.  I don't expect the laws to change 
<br>
favorably any time soon.  What I do expect is that eventually 
<br>
copyright of information will become impractical and incapable 
<br>
of being enforced except through means quite draconian that will 
<br>
incite rebellion.
<br>
<p>In principle there is no difference between an AI reading books 
<br>
and having
<br>
much more perfect retention and access than a human with a 
<br>
photographic memory reading the books.  The AIs information is 
<br>
simply more complete and much more accessible and possibly more 
<br>
shareable.  This is one of the places where current copyright 
<br>
notions are obviously faulty.  Is copyright dependent on 
<br>
relative weak understanding, retention and ability to reproduce 
<br>
information?  Will clinging to copyright cause us to limit our 
<br>
own augmentation and the abilities of AIs?
<br>
<p>Very interesting indeed.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2.  Would a knowledge economy replace or supplement the bookselling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business?  The reduction in friction would address the point of your post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>If you mean an economy based on ownership of 
<br>
knowledge/information, that is the last thing I want to see. 
<br>
Its implementation would cause much more friction than what we 
<br>
have today.
