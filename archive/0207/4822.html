<em>&gt; Someone just asked me this question in a private e-mail:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S, I have always wondered one thing, if i may ask you this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do we as humans, feel the need to create something with the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being much greater than us? interms of Intelligence and awareness (And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even possibly, in Physical Strength.) I figured I would ask you this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you are a scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***
</em><br>
<p>Because intelligence is the way to solve all problems.  So whatever it 
<br>
is you want to do, you can do it most effectively with intelligence. 
<br>
The Singularity is a subgoal of everything.  That's my reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the motivation is a combination of a number of factors, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not limited to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) We are evolutionarily programmed to seek greater intelligence.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an odd assertion, it probably goes along with the trajectory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing intelligence that has resulted in the creation of humans from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primates...
</em><br>
<p>Introspectively, I can see several adaptations that appreciate 
<br>
intelligence when it's presented (i.e., &quot;That's wicked clever.&quot;) 
<br>
There's also emotional support for excelling at competition, whether 
<br>
that competition takes the form of physical strength or intelligence. 
<br>
But I don't know that I can see an drive to actually explicitly seek 
<br>
greater intelligence.  I'm not sure we have any built-in definition of 
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; - just a lot of little adaptations that look at various 
<br>
things that happen to be intelligent and make them pleasurable to 
<br>
behold.  I'm not sure that any of these translate into a long-term 
<br>
drive.  I'm not sure we have adapted support for lifelong romances with 
<br>
intelligence, as opposed to just brief flings - although of course many 
<br>
Western philosophies call for such a romance.
<br>
<p>You're right that it's not odd to postulate it, but having postulated 
<br>
it, I don't actually see it.
<br>
<p>Although it may be noteworthy in this connection that many men and women 
<br>
list &quot;intelligence&quot; as a primary requisite in a desirable mate; some of 
<br>
the women and a few of the men may even have been non-self-deceptive 
<br>
about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Perhaps there is some kind of trans-human force in the universe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushes toward the creation of greater intelligence, and humanity itself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a manifestation of this (this is a &quot;self-organizational&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictly &quot;evolutionary&quot; answer)
</em><br>
<p>Do you have support for this hypothesis of which I am unaware?  Because 
<br>
with the support I currently see, I wouldn't have rated this as being 
<br>
worth a mention in your reply.  (Unfortunately the human mind seems 
<br>
designed to accept wishful thinking as &quot;support&quot; - but it's not.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) There is a kind of existential/emotional lack most humans feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internally, which causes them to reach out for something greater than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, be it a God or a future superintelligent being
</em><br>
<p>Or it's just a spandrel of our emotional setup that we find the 
<br>
hypothesis of a God appealing when it's presented, so if even one person 
<br>
comes up with the idea, the meme propagates.  You don't need to 
<br>
hypothesize an actual reaching out.  And it seems pretty straightforward 
<br>
that people would be comforted by the thought of a supernatural being 
<br>
looking out for their interests, especially in the afterlife.  It's more 
<br>
subjectively pleasant to think about.  An unfortunate byproduct of our 
<br>
motivational architecture is that pleasant thoughts tend to be 
<br>
reinforced at the expense of painful thoughts for reasons orthogonal to 
<br>
their truth or falsity.
