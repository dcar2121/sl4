<p>Well, the problem as I see it, is not that we always let the AI out of the 
<br>
box, but that we can't accurately judge whether it is friendly or not. 
<br>
<p><p>Becuase the precautions have to include someway to let the AI out if it's 
<br>
nice, otherwise, why are we making the AI? just so we can wave at it through 
<br>
soundproof, auto-opaquing glass? Also, the big problem is not just people 
<br>
letting it out, but the AI acting on the world in an unFriendly way.. so 
<br>
it would have to be a prison for the AI as well, and the difficulty of imprisoning 
<br>
a transhuman intelligence, even one of known origin and substrate, is difficult 
<br>
to assess at best, and impossible at worst. 
<br>
<p>The challenge is not to design 
<br>
a perfect prison or vault, but to create an AI that we can trust to some 
<br>
reasonable degree, whether through character or design. Now character is 
<br>
shifty, and while i'd love to trust ver on that, I'm afraid I probably couldn't 
<br>
take the chance. So design it is. And at this point, all I've heard are 
<br>
Asimov Law-type injunctions, Friendly Goalsystems, and Goertzel's Novamente's 
<br>
FriendlyNode thingey. Of those, Friendliness(a la Yudkowsky) and perhaps 
<br>
Goertzel's sytem are the only types I think would survive, although i'd 
<br>
have to see more of the documentation on both in their specific instances 
<br>
of course. 
<br>
<p>Most other schemes depend on determining the character of the 
<br>
AI, which is so insanely dangerous and ill omened, I hardly have words for 
<br>
it. (well, of course I have words for it, I just told you some, don't let 
<br>
my propensity for hyperbole scare you off, it's just really really a bad 
<br>
idea) An AI will not be a person like a human is. It's personality and goals 
<br>
are likely to follow rules unintuitive and alien to us. Our social reflexes 
<br>
are entirely inappropriate. And very misleading, as the AI boxing experiment 
<br>
illustrates. Absolutely none of the participants let the AI out for the 
<br>
right reasons, and I believe that to be because the right reasons can't 
<br>
be determined by interaction at that stage and in that medium.

&quot;No, I don't think so. A person can be sincere and still be stupid&quot;
