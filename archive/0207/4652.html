<p>I have lots of various Internet experience and had previously given this 
<br>
some thought.  One way to do this would be to use a specially constructed 
<br>
proxy.  The AI itself (its code, actually) would have no way of interfacing 
<br>
directly with the Internet.  The safest solution would be to not have any 
<br>
network protocols installed or accessible on the AI systems 
<br>
themselves.  Requests to gather data would be passed to an dedicated 
<br>
retrieval system, probably by using a custom protocol on a serial line or 
<br>
such.  The AI's software would have no control over how the HTTP request 
<br>
was generated or structured.
<br>
<p>The ideal system, actually, would completely opaque the retrieval 
<br>
method.  So that the AI could request information about X and the retrieval 
<br>
system could use multiple protocols (HTTP, NNTP, FTP, WAIS, whatever) to 
<br>
fetch information.  Any links (URLs) embedded within the information would 
<br>
be translated to a custom hyper-link format (used only by the AI software 
<br>
such as a GUID marked as a hyper-link) before being sent to the AI.  The 
<br>
retrieval system would then keep a mapping of these custom hyper-links to 
<br>
real URLs, but would never communicate this to the AI.  In such a system 
<br>
the AI wouldn't even know it was getting information from the Internet and 
<br>
definitely not have any idea what protocol specific the information 
<br>
actually used.
<br>
<p>Once the AI becomes smarter than its designers, or at least much faster 
<br>
than them, there may be a chance that it could somehow exploit bugs in the 
<br>
software running the serial connection (either side) or something similar 
<br>
to gain more control.  There are many ways that such attempts could be 
<br>
detected and this would provide an ideal trigger event for a fail safe.
