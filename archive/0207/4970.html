<p>First, the Box problem doesn't apply to an SI.  I believe most people

(at least on SL4) agree that once you have an SI there is no way to keep

it in prision, period.  Thus the box tests can only apply to

infra-human, human level or trans-human AIs.

<p>It is, in my personal opinion, unlikely that an infra-human or human

level AI could effectively control a human via a TTY with the safeguards

previously discussed on this list.  This type of thing only starts to 
<br>
become practicle with trans-human AI.

<p>In any case, none of this is at all relevant to the box tests conducted

and report here on SL4.  It can't be because neither Eliezer nor Justin 
<br>
are SIs and, thus, can't employ brain attacks.  So the argument that all 
<br>
humans are equivelant to an SI using brain attacks is irrelevant here.
<br>
<p>Since is is unlikely that random people will be conversing with AIs in 
<br>
boxes, and even if they are they won't have the power to release them, I 
<br>
maintain that the experiments conducted by Justing are not relevant and 
<br>
can not be used as the basis for any decision making.
