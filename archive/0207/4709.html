<p>JR&gt; I don't think it really matters; I was discussing it more as a consequence

JR&gt; of certain premises, not evaluating the consequences.  With respect to
<br>
JR&gt; possible consequences, it defines our relationship to an SI.  If we actually
<br>
JR&gt; had free will, a consequence of that is that humans would be inscrutable to
<br>
JR&gt; an SI.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure this follows.  Predictability != lack of free will.
<br>
Let's presume a dog has free will (I assume we're not exclusively
<br>
talking about higher level, intelligent/analytical decision making,
<br>
but also simple &quot;shall I lick my balls or chase the cat&quot; choices),
<br>
we might still be able to predict its behaviour.
<br>
<p>Conversely, presuming a 'photon' has no free will doesn't give
<br>
us the ability to predict its behaviour in a two-slit experiment.
<br>
<p>JR&gt; However, there are other mathematical consequences to this that do
<br>
JR&gt; not map to the reality of human minds as we actually know them.
<br>
<p>JR&gt; I behave as though I have free will, but I also realize that this probably
<br>
JR&gt; can't be the case in an omniscient objective sense.
<br>
<p>I think this still presumes predictability (in that sense) = lack of free
<br>
will, which I don't see as necessarily the case.
<br>
<p>The &quot;free will&quot; concept is pretty slippery in any case; one common
<br>
formulation is that &quot;we could have chosen differently&quot;.  But in the
<br>
end, of course, we couldn't -- all probability curves end up
<br>
collapsing one way or the other, and in retrospect, everything that
<br>
has occurred was &quot;fated&quot; to occur exactly the way it did, including
<br>
our &quot;choices&quot;.  In a sense, the whole concept of hypotheticals is
<br>
bogus, from the standpoint of hard science.
<br>
<p>At least, until we build that lateral time machine.
