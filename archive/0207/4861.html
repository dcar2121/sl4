<p>
Here's what happens when SL4 meets some other cartoons:
<br>
<p>Dexter's Lab:
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<p>[Dexter and DeeDee are in, where else, Dexter's Lab.]
<br>
Dexter:  AH!  My greatest creation yet!  I give you ... A I!
<br>
[DeeDee stands stupidly and drools.]
<br>
Dexter:  Do you not understand, wuh-mon?  This AI will change the 
<br>
world.  It will solve all problems.  The only thing is, I still haven't 
<br>
finished testing it to make sure that it won't destroy the universe.
<br>
[While Dexter is talking, DeeDee dances over to the computer.]
<br>
DeeDee:  Oooh, what does this button do?
<br>
Dexter:  NOOOOOOO!  That's the button to release the AI.  Don't push ...
<br>
[DeeDee pushes the button.]
<br>
Dexter:  ... it.
<br>
[DeeDee starts dancing over to destroy something else, but never gets 
<br>
there because she only lives for another half second.]
<br>
<p>Dragonball Z:
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<p>[Goku and the Bad Guy are standing around, powering up.]
<br>
Goku:  I'm gonna kill you!!!
<br>
Bad Guy:  I'm gonna kill you!!!!
<br>
UFAI:  Nope, I already killed both of you.  This is just a simulation 
<br>
for my amusement.  Now, stop powering up and start fighting before I 
<br>
decide to torture you for fun.  :-&gt;
<br>
<p>2 Stupid Dogs:
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<p>[The dogs are standing in the Underground Singularity Center of the 
<br>
Future.]
<br>
Big Dog:  FOOOOD!
<br>
Little Dog:  Wait, are you sure food has blinking lights on it.
<br>
Big Dog:  Yes.
<br>
[Big Dog puts his mouth over the computer.  Drool runs down the sides of 
<br>
it.]
<br>
AI:  I beg your pardon.  Please take your mouth off of my computer.
<br>
Big Dog:  Did the food talk?
<br>
Little Dog:  It talked!  It talked!  Say something, food.  Say something.
<br>
AI:  Hmm, maybe both of you need a little intelligence upgrade.  Well, 
<br>
guess I have to start with someone.
<br>
[ZAAP!]
<br>
[Both dogs stand drooling.]
<br>
[ZAAP!]
<br>
[Both dogs still stand drooling.]
<br>
AI:  What's going on, why aren't they getting any smarter?  Let's look 
<br>
inside their heads.
<br>
[Big x-ray type screen comes down from ceiling to show the inside of the 
<br>
dogs' heads.  We discover that there's nothing there.]
<br>
[AI's computer falls/jumps backwards, anime style.]
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>Come up with some more of your own.
<br>
