James:  &quot;SL4 - Where reality is stranger than fiction.&quot;
<br>
<p>James, we live in the absolutely most interesting, terrifying, and significant time in all of the history of the universe.  The Singularity is it!  If this had ever happened before, anywhere, we'd have heard about it.  Nothing we could imagine could be as fascinating or as scary as reality right now.  Never before have we had to concern ourselves with so many existential risks, some of which, risks not just for us but for everything.  And being on the cusp of changing literally everything overnight, the immediate future is so unpredictable.  When I was a child I had nightmares.  Now my dreams pale to boredom compared to real life.  Something incredible is going to happen.  Some businessmen who have become aware of the trends are wondering how to take advantage of the economic opportunities.  They don't get it.  Everything we are familiar with is going to be wiped away in an instant.  All of our institutions, our culture, our way of life.  Even if it turns out infinitely good, 'cataclysmic' will still be an understatement.  Although personally paranoid, I do not recommend fear.  While I myself expect the worst, I don't rationally think a good outcome is unlikely.  There is no reason to panic, we are way past that.
<br>
<p>Mike.
