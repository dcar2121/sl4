</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; If that's true, it doesn't change the fact that Ben Goertzel has

</em><br>
<em> &gt; population of entities with goal systems N such that the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; population-level effect would be to optimize C.  Now this can be argued
</em><br>
<p>You know, actually, I don't remember ever having seen such a post by
<br>
Ben.  For a period of some months I didn't read many of the posts on SL4
<br>
so I'm guessing this is why.  Could you refer me to the post/thread in
<br>
question, I would very much like to read that thread...
<br>
<p><em> &gt; as moral or immoral.  It happens that I think it's immoral, at least the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; way Ben is defining C.  But that could be argued.  What does not change
</em><br>
<em> &gt; is that you are focusing on your personal impressions of myself and Ben
</em><br>
<em> &gt; at the expense of completely losing track of our actual respective
</em><br>
<em> &gt; positions.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that to be the case.  The Sysop scenario you, yourself,
<br>
suggested previously is highly immoral in my opinion.  If you are
<br>
correct about Ben then you have both proposed immoral (subject to
<br>
perspective) goals.
<br>
<p>Maybe Humanity is just screwed and the reason we haven't found any
<br>
evidence of advanced civilizations is that there is no practical way to
<br>
get beyond this point.  But I'm going to hope and act as if that is not
<br>
the case (since I don't see any rational alternative).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; As for the rest of your post, if you're wiser than me for whatever
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reason, this should be shown and not told.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  The only reason this specific discussion is taking place is
<br>
because you keep bringing up why it is that I trust Ben's decision more
<br>
than yours.  If it makes you feel any better, I would probably trust
<br>
your decisions more than those of 90-95% of the populace.
