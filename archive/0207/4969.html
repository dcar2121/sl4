<p>As much as I think that God comparisons are largely unhelpful, as God is 
<br>
a fictional character and comparing ourselves to any other fictional character 
<br>
is only obliquely useful as a tool for examining one'self; I think that, 
<br>
based on my last reading of the bible, (which was almost two years ago, 
<br>
mind) the only feats of God's that remain out of our purview have to do 
<br>
with the nature of the universe in God's care. 
<br>
<p>For example, God raises 
<br>
the dead prophet Samuel to speak with David. Or more dramatically the making 
<br>
and unmaking of our world. Most of the other active things he did could 
<br>
be replicated, if not in the character they were done in the bible. We can 
<br>
hardly imbue a person with the ability to part an ocean by raising his hands, 
<br>
even if we can part the sea itself.
<br>
<p>But this question brings up a more interesting one(to my point of view, 
<br>
in any case.) I see religious belief as largely a problem to be overcome 
<br>
individually, through education, or self questioning. But is there a point 
<br>
at which God can be discredited publicly en masse? What would it take to 
<br>
simply prove to everyone that God does not exist? 
<br>
<p>Obviously replicating 
<br>
all his feats would be a start, but there is little in the memeset of religion 
<br>
that says his footsteps cannot be followed. Unfortunately, the memeset of 
<br>
Christianity in particular has mutated to the point that miracles are no 
<br>
longer neccesary to prove belief. In fact, a lack of action of any kind 
<br>
on God's part is explained and encouraged, else I would rip a page out of 
<br>
his book, and challange all the prophets of gods to a miracle-off. I'll 
<br>
do it myself, with a cellphone, a yellow pages, and a few hundred bucks. 
<br>
I can conjure with the best of em. 
<br>
<p>So, a challenge of action being out, 
<br>
what about some kind of public inquiry? A panel of elected experts of any 
<br>
kind, and their final results are televised? 
<br>
<p>The problem with this issue, 
<br>
is that so few religious people have beliefs of any substance, and the hypothesis 
<br>
of God is supremely untestable. 
<br>
<p>hmm. In my recent vein of going to the 
<br>
populace for wisdom, I think I'll hang out with a smattering of religious 
<br>
folks, and see if a testable hypothesis for God can't be worked up, as I 
<br>
see this question as one that should be resolved. 
<br>
<p>Now, keep in mind I 
<br>
have no real antipathy to the concept of God, although if he does exist, 
<br>
he has quite a few questions to answer for the design flaws we currently 
<br>
labor under. I simply have yet to come across a way to in any way confirm 
<br>
his existence, so my search for a testable hypothesis is in this vein. I 
<br>
have nothing wrong with the experiment going either way. Although, naturally 
<br>
I doubt it could turn out but to my advantage in this regard. ;-)
<br>
<p>So, off I go, if anybody has any ideas for a way to test the God hypothesis, 
<br>
no matter how far off they may seem, send them too me personally, lets not 
<br>
pollute SL4 with anything but the final findings of this inquiry
