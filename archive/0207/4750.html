<p>MW&gt; My own intuition is that the likelyhood of FAI over UAI is
<br>
MW&gt; high enough that it is more important to bring it quickly
<br>
MW&gt; than safe (if that is possible), because of the various
<br>
MW&gt; other existential (or big-step back) events that could occur
<br>
MW&gt; in the meantime.  None-the-less I feel its important to
<br>
MW&gt; discuss strategies for containing code, which, regardless
<br>
MW&gt; of it's sentience or friendliness is capable of evolving
<br>
MW&gt; and reproducing unlike anything currently infecting the
<br>
MW&gt; internet.
<br>
<p>One possible approach to making the AI more amenable to study,
<br>
analysis and containment would be to simply (presuming non-modifiable
<br>
hardware and a very limited communication channel) bring the
<br>
clockspeed down.
<br>
<p>Without external referents, the AI can have no concept or perception
<br>
of time other than number of clock cycles.  We can run it at 10GHz or
<br>
1Hz and it will have no idea unless we clue it in.  Fixing our vt100
<br>
transmission speed relative to its clockspeed, e.g. 1 character for
<br>
every 1000 of its clocks, would eliminate at least that clue.
<br>
<p>Leaving aside all questions of urgency due to other factors, and all
<br>
other things being equal -- shouldnt't we have at least *somewhat* better
<br>
odds of figuring out what an AI at 0.01% of full speed is doing than one
<br>
running at full speed?
<br>
<p>For instance, we *might*, based on how we seeded the AI and how ve grew,
<br>
have reason to think that this chunk of nodes correlates more strongly
<br>
to social/psychological analysis/cognition, and that chunk of nodes
<br>
more strongly to spatial/mathematical cognition, etc.
<br>
<p>Bringing the clockspeed down -- way down -- during an AI box
<br>
experiment would then let us then study such activation patterns at
<br>
our leisure, and speculate as to what was going on, without the AI
<br>
being able to deduce from an increased latency of our replies that we
<br>
were doing so.
<br>
<p>The *content* of our communications could still clue it in, but
<br>
1) we would have eliminated at least one information channel
<br>
2) we would have more time to try to minimize the suspiciousness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of our responses, to the extreme of e.g. presenting a team member
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who hadn't participated in the analysis with the dialogue so far,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ask their immediate response -- since we may be more interested
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the AI's responses or brain patterns than the conversation
<br>
3) we may be able to spot it performing more than obviously necessary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;textual analysis on our responses, which could indicate suspicion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on its part.
<br>
<p>Although improbable but not, I think, impossible, we may even be able
<br>
to bring the clockspeed down exponentially just as it starts
<br>
to accelerate exponentially past human-level intelligence.  We could
<br>
give it a shot, in any case.
<br>
<p>Just to clarify: I am in no way arguing that speeding us up relative
<br>
to a transhuman AI could make us &quot;just as intelligent&quot;, or that if I
<br>
could just run my brain at 10x the clock speed of yours, that would
<br>
make me 10x as smart -- but I *am* arguing for *some* relative
<br>
improvement, which we can try to maximize by getting the timing right.
