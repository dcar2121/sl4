</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; an answer (though your interpreter will be happy to rationalize a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; reason for you), it's more accurate to say that this is simply what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; you think.  Intuition constantly sounds to me like you're claiming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; you were divinely inspired in your thoughts (which may be possible if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; science isn't right, but AFAIK such a possibility is not readily 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Hmmm.  Actually, science could be perfectly right and there could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; still be intuition that was not from merely subconscious processing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; within the brain.  One way this could be true is if (short form) we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are in fact within a VR/sim and in certain modes we either have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; flash of access to or get bleed over from the underlying computational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; matrix.  This could also explain some mystical inspired states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A more likely cause (in my book at least) would stem from quantum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics.  I'm defiantly no expect on this stuff but the little I do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know about is pretty amazing.  For instance, you can tangle 2 quantum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles together and they will then maintain exactly opposite states 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (switch one and the other switches).  Then you can move these particles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very long distance and they still have this effect, and it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually instantaneous (ie: I believe can be faster than light).
</em><br>
<p>The problem that I have with quantum theories of the brain (among other 
<br>
problems, but this is my major problem with these theories) is that the 
<br>
brain needs to be robust to work well.  If every whim of a particle can 
<br>
cause neuron firings, the brain probably wouldn't work at all.  From 
<br>
what I can tell, brains are much more like computers NASA builds to go 
<br>
up in space:  they can take a blast of radiation and keep on working.  
<br>
As much as people like to think they have complete free will, the same 
<br>
patterns of thought are evident in most people (most people includes me) 
<br>
and unless you like to be mystical or believe in quantum mystics, it is 
<br>
most likely that the brain is just really good at always getting the 
<br>
same kind of answer all of the time.  Even the parts we can rewire don't 
<br>
change how we think so drastically that our minds become as alien as an 
<br>
AIs.
<br>
<p>Besides, I assert there's no such thing as free will and it's just an 
<br>
illusion of the interpreter, but that's another thread.
<br>
<p>Also, I'm not sure that defiant non expectance is a good way to start 
<br>
out presenting an idea.  :^)
