</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S, I have always wondered one thing, if i may ask you this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do we as humans, feel the need to create something with the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being much greater than us? interms of Intelligence and awareness (And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even possibly, in Physical Strength.) I figured I would ask you this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you are a scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My answer was as follows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the motivation is a combination of a number of factors, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not limited to:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) We are evolutionarily programmed to seek greater intelligence.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an odd assertion, it probably goes along with the trajectory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing intelligence that has resulted in the creation of humans from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primates...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think this comes close to the widely discredited notion of 
<br>
evolution being directional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Perhaps there is some kind of trans-human force in the universe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pushes toward the creation of greater intelligence, and humanity itself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a manifestation of this (this is a &quot;self-organizational&quot; rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictly &quot;evolutionary&quot; answer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>No evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) There is a kind of existential/emotional lack most humans feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internally, which causes them to reach out for something greater than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, be it a God or a future superintelligent being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Anyone have any additional answers to add?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps as we all feel mortality and seek for something beyond 
<br>
it or to somehow &quot;make sense of it all&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, I think the best reason for the desire to increase 
<br>
intelligence and to transcend is because our 
<br>
intelligence/knowledge/rationality is our characteristic means 
<br>
of survival and well-being.  For the sake of our own survival 
<br>
and well-being we seek to increase our intelligence.  We also 
<br>
see the creation of more intelligence than we can aspire to even 
<br>
in seriously augmented form as being a womderful thing for much 
<br>
the same reasons.
<br>
<p>The phrasing is a bit off I think.  We feel the need to 
<br>
transcend our own condition whether or not it is we ourselves or 
<br>
others like us or deriving from us directly who most transcend 
<br>
our limitations and most acheive what we idealize.
