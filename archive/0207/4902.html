<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;What
<br>
I am interested in is how the thing we call &quot;intelligence&quot; interacts
<br>
with the thing we call &quot;wisdom&quot;, a real issue well worth debating.
<br>
<p>### Just recently I finished reading E.Goldberg's &quot;The Executive Brain&quot;.
<br>
Among other things he describes Toby, an extreme case of the dissociation
<br>
between intelligence and wisdom (as commonly defined). Toby has a huge but
<br>
chaotic knowledge base in all kinds of subjects. He succeeds in all jobs he
<br>
undertakes but never accomplishes anything significant. He spent years as a
<br>
male prostitute, was dependent on drugs, alcohol. He never plans for the
<br>
future. Although he is intellectually capable of foreseeing the results of
<br>
his actions, he does not modify his behavior to avoid adverse experiences.
<br>
Things &quot;happen&quot; to him. He does suffer despite having all the processing
<br>
power needed to escape suffering.
<br>
<p>This illustrates the difference between intelligence and wisdom as I see it:
<br>
intelligence is the ability to derive knowledge from information, wisdom is
<br>
the application of intelligence and knowledge to the modification of own
<br>
(long-term) goal system within the large scale context - the world. It's
<br>
hard to have the latter without the former, but possible to have the former
<br>
without the latter.
