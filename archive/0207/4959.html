<p>DE&gt; I've had it on my list of things to do when I have
<br>
DE&gt; too much time on my hands (i.e. never) to go through
<br>
DE&gt; the Bible and list all the things God did, then see
<br>
DE&gt; how many of them we now can do.  Then take the list
<br>
DE&gt; of things we can't yet do and make it my 'to do' list.
<br>
<p>I don't have the Gospel of Thomas to hand, but recall being struck
<br>
by a few of the preconditions for entering Heaven -- &quot;not until X
<br>
shall ye enter the Kingdom of Heaven&quot;, where X was:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- the male becomes female, and the female male (done, varying
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degrees of success)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- ye make an image replacing an image (done)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- ye make a hand replacing a hand (pretty close, afaik)
<br>
<p>Note: my recollection of the Gospel of Thomas could be off.  I believe
<br>
all the &quot;conditions&quot; needed to be met, and there were more.  (Perhaps
<br>
these were less &quot;conditions&quot; than &quot;coincidences&quot;, i.e. by the time
<br>
you enter heaven you'll notice you've also done a, b and c.)
<br>
<p>Also of possible relevance is a quote from Stewart Brand, erstwhile
<br>
editor of the Whole Earth Catalog and arguably early explicit
<br>
neophile: &quot;We are as Gods, and may as well get good at it.&quot;
<br>
<p>So my short take is &quot;No&quot;, but we're getting there -- and I concur with
<br>
Brand that we may as well try to do it right, which makes things like
<br>
CFAI worth studying.
