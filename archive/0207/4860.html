<p><p>i've seen a few posts in this list about prodigy programmers (in reference 
<br>
to prodigy calculators, by the way prodigy calculators are not necessarily 
<br>
idiot/autist people).  Personally i've been surprised to see that i could 
<br>
also produce code very fastly.  Nothing really comparable to the above, i 
<br>
maxed at 4000/5000 lines per day, that was a long time ago (my early 
<br>
thirties).  And it was sqlc, that is not very difficult coding.  Also i 
<br>
could merge two code libraries 100 000 lines each in a matter of half a 
<br>
month.  But i did not sustain this rythm for a long time, far from a year.  
<br>
The reason being that in france it is very rare to have that much work to 
<br>
do, they had problem finding work for me (i worked on service companies).
<br>
<p>So what's all that got to do with sl4 ? Well in all modesty i'm just waiting 
<br>
to be of some use.  There might be a brief period where a GAI might be 
<br>
running and some firemen with great brain plasticity might be needed to 
<br>
fight the damage some idiots did ignite by doing some silly work of so 
<br>
called theoretical friendliness.
<br>
<p>Hopefully will be there (after fifty i think i won't be good anymore, 
<br>
anyhow)
<br>
<p>Jean.
