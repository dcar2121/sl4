<p>
My fellow Singularitarians,
<br>
<p>Registration is open for this yr's Summit -- limit 500.
<br>
<p>Join us: www.singularitysummit.com
<br>
<p>NEWS: Singularity Summit 2008: Opportunity, Risk, Leadership takes place
<br>
October 25 at the intimate Montgomery Theater in San Jose, CA, the
<br>
Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence announced today. Now in
<br>
its third year, the Singularity Summit gathers the smartest people around to
<br>
explore the biggest idea of our time: the Singularity.
<br>
<p>Keynotes will include Ray Kurzweil, updating his predictions in The
<br>
Singularity is Near, and Intel CTO Justin Rattner, who will examine the
<br>
Singularity's plausibility. At the Intel Developer Forum on August 21, 2008,
<br>
he explained why he thinks the gap between humans and machines will close by
<br>
2050. &quot;Rather than look back, we're going to look forward 40 years,&quot; said
<br>
Rattner. &quot;It's in that future where many people think that machine
<br>
intelligence will surpass human intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The acceleration of technological progress has been the central feature of
<br>
this century,&quot; said computer scientist Dr. Vernor Vinge in a seminal paper
<br>
in 1993. &quot;We are on the edge of change comparable to the rise of human life
<br>
on Earth. The precise cause of this change is the imminent creation by
<br>
technology of entities with greater than human intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>Singularity Summit 2008 will feature an impressive lineup:
<br>
<p>* Dr. Ruzena Bajcsy, pioneering AI and robotics researcher
<br>
* Dr. Eric Baum, AI researcher, author of What is Thought?
<br>

<p>About the Singularity Summit
<br>
<p>Each year, the Singularity Summit attracts a unique audience to the Bay
<br>
Area, with visionaries from business, science, technology, philanthropy, the
<br>
arts, and more. Participants learn where humanity is headed, meet the people
<br>
leading the way, and leave inspired to create a better world. &quot;The
<br>
Singularity Summit is the premier conference on the Singularity,&quot; Kurzweil
<br>
said. &quot;As we get closer to the Singularity, each year's conference is better
<br>
than the last.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Summit was founded in 2006 by long-term philanthropy executive Tyler
<br>
Emerson, inventor Ray Kurzweil, and investor Peter Thiel. Its purpose is to
<br>
bring together and build a visionary community to further dialogue and
<br>
action on complex, long-term issues that may transform the world. Its host
<br>
organization is Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a
<br>
501(c)(3) nonprofit organization studying the benefits and risks of advanced
<br>
artificial intelligence systems.
<br>
<p>Singularity Summit 2008 partners include Clarium Capital, Cartmell Holdings,
<br>
Twine, Powerset, United Therapeutics, KurzweilAI.net, IEEE Spectrum, DFJ, X
<br>
PRIZE Foundation, Long Now Foundation, Foresight Nanotech Institute,
<br>
Novamente, SciVestor, Robotics Trends, and MINE.
