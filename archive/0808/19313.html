<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2008 Midwest NKS Conference: Call for Papers and/or Participation
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GENERAL ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Extension of Abstract Submission Due Date)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is computation? (How) does nature compute?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2008 Midwest NKS Conference
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri Oct 31 - Sun Nov 2, 2008
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indiana University -- Bloomington, IN
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dgerman/2008midwestNKSconference/">http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dgerman/2008midwestNKSconference/</a>
<br>
<p>In 1964, in one of the six Messenger lectures he delivered at Cornell
<br>
University (later published as a book &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;)
<br>
Richard Feynman said: &quot;It always bothers me that, according to the
<br>
laws as we understand them today, it takes a computing machine an
<br>
infinite number of logical operations to figure out what goes on in no
<br>
matter how tiny a region of space, and no matter how tiny a region of
<br>
time ... So I have often made the hypothesis that ultimately physics
<br>
will not require a mathematical statement, that in the end the
<br>
machinery will be revealed, and the laws will turn out to be simple,
<br>
like the chequer board with all its apparent complexities.&quot;
<br>
<p>The topic of the conference has been chosen with this quote in mind.
<br>
The conference will host a most distinguished group of scientists
<br>
supporting different views of a computable universe, from those
<br>
supporting the thesis that Nature performs (only) digital computation
<br>
and does it up to a maximal level, to those supporting the thesis of
<br>
nature as a quantum computer. Some strongly suggest however that the
<br>
true nature of Nature can be only explained by the study of
<br>
randomness. Randomness however preserves its mysterious reputation,
<br>
for some of these authors it seems that randomness can be generated
<br>
deterministically in the classical sense, while others claim the
<br>
existence of &quot;true&quot; randomness from the principles underlying quantum
<br>
mechanics necessarily to explain the complexity seen around. This
<br>
event will become the place of confluence in which all these views
<br>
will be presented, discussed and analyzed by the guests and the
<br>
conference participants themselves. After presenting their views
<br>
during the first three days of the conference, the keynote speakers
<br>
will then participate in a round table discussion on the topic.
<br>
<p>Keynote speakers:

<br>
<p>Conference topics
<br>
-----------------
<br>
<p>Topics of interest for submissions include (but are not limited to):
<br>
<p>- Pure NKS projects
<br>
- The physics of computation
<br>
- Computational physics
<br>
- Foundations of computation
<br>
- Universality and Irreducibility
<br>
- Classical (digital) and quantum computation
<br>
- Algorithmic information theory
<br>
<p>It is encouraged to relate the above topics with the conference title
<br>
(What is computation? (How) does nature compute?) and the points of
<br>
intersection between classical computation, quantum computation,
<br>
algorithmic information theory, and the principle of computational
<br>
equivalence.
<br>
<p>Important Dates
<br>
---------------
<br>
Authors are invited to submit a title and a long abstract of one or
<br>
two pages providing a perspective on research results related to the
<br>
topics above. Accepted abstracts will be presented during the first
<br>
day of the conference on Fri morning and early afternoon October 31.
<br>
Papers that have been accepted for presentation will be considered for
<br>
publication in the journal of Complex Systems
<br>
(<a href="http://www.complex-systems.com/">http://www.complex-systems.com/</a>) which will have a special number
<br>
dedicated to this conference.
<br>
<p>Title and short abstract due: 25 August 2008 (Abstract Submission New
<br>
Due Date: 5 September)
<br>
Abstract notification: 15 September 2008
<br>
Conference: 31 Oct-2 Nov 2008
<br>
<p>Conference paper due: 31 October 2008
<br>
Paper notification: 1 December 2008
<br>
Camera-ready paper due: 15 December 2008
<br>
<p>The short abstracts must be in English and provide sufficient details
<br>
to allow the organizing committee and the advisory board to assess the
<br>
potential merits of each submission. One author of each accepted
<br>
abstract will be expected to attend the conference and make the
<br>
presentation. Abstracts/papers submitted for consideration must be
<br>
unpublished, original work of the authors that has not been submitted
<br>
for publication elsewhere, but may contain previously published
<br>
material. Short abstracts must be submitted electronically by the date
<br>
above to <a href="mailto:hectorz@andrew.cmu.edu?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%202008%20Midwest%20NKS%20Conference:%20Call%20for%20Papers%20and/or%20Participation">hectorz@andrew.cmu.edu</a> with &quot;2008 Midwest NKS Conf. Short
<br>
Abstract&quot; included in the subject line.
<br>
<p>Format
<br>
------
<br>
The symposium is a four days event organized to provide an atmosphere
<br>
that fosters collaborative work, discussions and interactions.
<br>
Lectures are given by the keynote speakers listed above and by the
<br>
authors of accepted abstracts.
