<p><em>&gt; Unlike most people on this list, I don't think that the singularity is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions, will beat exponential feedback).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I'm on this list because if a singularity does happen, it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the importance getting involved is still very high, even if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity is unlikely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was just wondering if there were other people like me on the list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if this is a good audience to target. Basically by definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list self-selects those who believe a singularity is likely. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we critically lack well informed people (I don't include myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that list), who see a singularity as plausible, but unlikely. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were some of these, we could better test the strength of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity arguments, against real opponents (and not against those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who just wave their hands and say &quot;that'll never happen!&quot;)
</em><br>
<p><p>I also think the singularity is unlikely to work, but for very different
<br>
reasons. I think it already happened, not necessarily on earth, and our
<br>
world is a simulation, even a fiction. We don't seem to have been interfered
<br>
with much so far, but at some point that may change, and the singularity
<br>
seems likely to be that point. This has the potential to be a significant
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>I find it very difficult to estimate the likelihood of this, but even if
<br>
things go smoothly we are still a ship in a bottle, so I spend most of my
<br>
time in more fringe research looking for a way out.
