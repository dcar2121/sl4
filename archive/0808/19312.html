<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel, noted scientist, author, futurist and pioneer in the
<br>
field of Artificial Intelligence, was the featured guest of the August
<br>
13, 2008 Episode of The Future and You. Topics he discusses include:
<br>
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the singularity, transhumanism,
<br>
human immortality and how long he expects to live, and why (like the
<br>
show's host Stephen Euin Cobb) he is a founding member of the Order of
<br>
Cosmic Engineers. The Future and You (Wikipedia) is an award-winning
<br>
podcast hosted by Stephen Euin Cobb. The show's host interviews a
<br>
variety of authors, scientists, celebrities and &quot;pioneers of the
<br>
future&quot; as to what they believe both the near future and distant
<br>
future will be like for individuals as well as for humanity in
<br>
general.
<br>
<p>Highlights of the interview include: The mechanism of human empathy
<br>
seems to have been identified, and so can be reproduced in AI; even AI
<br>
that is radically different in its thinking from human beings. Doctor
<br>
Goertzel explains that this empathy is not based on emotion, and he
<br>
emphasizes that he does not want to create an AI which is governed by
<br>
its emotions.
<br>
<p>He stresses that the human mind does not qualify as a completely
<br>
'General Intelligence' but lies somewhere on the spectrum between AGI
<br>
on one end and 'Narrow AI' on the other. This is one of several
<br>
reasons why he does not expect AGI to be achieved by mimicking the
<br>
workings of the human brain.
<br>
<p>He describes how our brains fool us into believing that we understand
<br>
our actions and decisions when we don't. And why modeling an AI too
<br>
closely on the human brain might make it too, vulnerable to false
<br>
notions.
<br>
<p>He also says, 'I think virtual worlds are going to be absolutely
<br>
critical to the development of Artificial General Intelligence.' As
<br>
well as 'Right now connecting AI's to virtual worlds is probably the
<br>
best way to get an AI to have a general human-like embodied
<br>
experience.'
