<em>&gt; I was just wondering if there were other people like me on the list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if this is a good audience to target. Basically by definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list self-selects those who believe a singularity is likely. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we critically lack well informed people (I don't include myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that list), who see a singularity as plausible, but unlikely. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were some of these, we could better test the strength of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity arguments, against real opponents (and not against those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who just wave their hands and say &quot;that'll never happen!&quot;).
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm glad there are skeptics who are willing to talk about this. I think the
<br>
Singularity is so theoretical that most of the people willing to discuss it
<br>
think it will happen -- talking about why some gigantic, world-changing
<br>
phenomenon is *not* real would be no fun (unless you're Richard Dawkins).
<br>
<p>But your aggregate opinion is less important than your view on specific
<br>
areas. If we break down possible Singularities into, say, a biotech-driven,
<br>
nanotech-driven, hardware-driven, or software-driven singularity, we
<br>
probably don't have a full majority supporting each position. And at that
<br>
point, it's obvious that we can further divide things, to the point that
<br>
each list member has a basically unique view of the most likely outcome.
<br>
<p>So we're close to a monoculture on the premise that the singularity could
<br>
happen, but we can still have a great discussion of any specific narrative.
<br>
That's probably the best we can hope for.
