</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if this is a good audience to target. Basically by definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list self-selects those who believe a singularity is likely. I

</em><br>
<p>Your question would benefit from an explicit definition of what
<br>
exactly you mean by &quot;singularity&quot;.
<br>
<p>One definition would be nothing fancier than the creation of
<br>
human-surpassing AI. To me, that seems rather inevitable at *some*
<br>
point (assuming a technologically advancing civilization continues to
<br>
exist). It also seems that once we have only mildly human-surpassing
<br>
AIs, we will rather quickly have greatly human-surpassing AIs, if not
<br>
by other means then by adding huge amounts of computing power, thereby
<br>
increasing the AI's thinking speed by an astronomical factor.
<br>
<p>Personally, I don't make the claim that we'll have human-level AI
<br>
soon. And I *hope* it is still a long way off. If I somehow became
<br>
convinced that a thousand years of slow progress is required before we
<br>
get there, I would be near-ecstatic. This is because things could be
<br>
done a lot safer if we had more time before someone else would do it
<br>
anyway. (&quot;It&quot; being the creation of entities astronomically more
<br>
powerful than us, possibly such that they aren't under our control,
<br>
and have goals significantly differing from ours.)
<br>
<p>What makes the singularity scenario worth a lot of attention is that
<br>
we can't rule out it happening in a couple of decades. It's not
<br>
necessary to claim that it's likely to happen soon, even if there were
<br>
grounds for such a stronger claim. (If I were to start presenting
<br>
grounds for such a claim, I would start by guesstimating when we are
<br>
likely to be able to emulate -- and subsequently modify -- the human
<br>
brain, and thereby human intelligence, on a computer.)
