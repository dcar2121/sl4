<em>&gt; I read it, but I didn't understand it. I could not find any logical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications in it. A central paragraph is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It follows that we have no reason to expect any SI we deal with to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attach a huge intrinsic utility to its own survival. Why? Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's an extremely specific outcome within a very large class of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes where the SI doesn't shut itself down immediately. There is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in other words, no Bayesian evidence - no likelihood ratio - that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says we are probably looking at an SI that attaches a huge intrinsic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility to its own survival; both hypotheses produce the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prediction for observed behavior.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There doesn't seem to be any reason given for the conclusion.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could just as well say, &quot;We have no reason to expect any animal we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with to attach utility to its own survival, because that's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely specific outcome within a very large class of animals who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't commit suicide immediately.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The difference is that we have strong reason to believe that animals are 
<br>
the result of Darwinian forces.  The point about an SI is that it's more 
<br>
likely to be the result of a design process than eons (or millions of 
<br>
generations) of natural selection.  It is natural selection that leads 
<br>
us to expect a survival instinct.

<p>Phil later wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; Darwinian evolution is only one subclass of the competitive systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that lead to self-preservation and greediness.  We can expect this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome when there is competition for limited resources, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion of the use of resources.  It doesn't matter whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition takes the form of a colony of organisms that increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their resource share by reproduction, and adapt by evolution; or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few superorganisms that increase their resource share by growing, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapt largely by introspection.
</em><br>
<p>But, (absent other forces you haven't specified yet) the drive for 
<br>
self-preservation is a predictable end-point of a particular selection 
<br>
process.  Have you ruled out other mechanisms?  I don't see where how 
<br>
your argument indicates that the only way to reach superintelligence 
<br>
also necessarily produces a drive for self preservation.  The necessity 
<br>
of that drive in creatures produced by Darwinian evolution and selection 
<br>
is pretty well established.

       It persuades us that things we do may last and matter.&quot;
