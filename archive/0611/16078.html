<em>&gt; This is a forum devoted to the Netflix Prize, $1 million for producing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collaborative filtering algorithm 10% better than Netflix's.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current leading contenders are edging up on 5% better than Netflix's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm, corresponding to a root mean squared error of .90.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't taken a potshot at this problem yet, but it's quite interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see how things go.  Right now, the current leading algorithm, beating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out many serious contenders, is apparently one that was rejected from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the NIPS conference as uninteresting.  Hence the name, &quot;NIPS Reject&quot;.)
</em><br>
<p>There's a neat thread on that forum which tells a little bit about who
<br>
the people on the leaderboard are:

<br>
<p>It seems that &quot;NIPS Reject&quot; is a PhD student of Geoff Hinton, a
<br>
well-known figure in the neural-networks community. I don't know if
<br>
this is the same work, but they published a Science paper a few months
<br>
ago, on &quot;Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks&quot;:

<br>
<p>I actually hadn't seen this paper before -- it's nice to see that
<br>
after all these years somebody's managed to tame autoencoder networks
<br>
into do something practical. From the end of the accompanying
<br>
Perspective article:
<br>
<p>&quot;This makes it practical to use much deeper networks than were
<br>
previously possible, thus
<br>
allowing more complex nonlinear codes to be learned. Although there is
<br>
an engineering flavor to much of the paper, this is the first
<br>
practical method that results in a completely invertible mapping, so
<br>
that new data may be projected into this very low dimensional space.
<br>
The hope is that these lower dimensional representations will be
<br>
useful for important tasks
<br>
such as pattern recognition, transformation, or visualization. Hinton
<br>
and Salakhutdinov have already demonstrated some excellent results in
<br>
widely varying domains. This is exciting work with many potential
<br>
applications in domains of current interest such as biology,
<br>
neuroscience, and the study of the Web.
<br>
<p>&quot;Recent advances in machine learning have caused some to consider
<br>
neural networks obsolete, even dead. This work suggests that such
<br>
announcements are premature.&quot;
