<br>
<p>This is a forum devoted to the Netflix Prize, $1 million for producing a 
<br>
collaborative filtering algorithm 10% better than Netflix's.  The 
<br>
current leading contenders are edging up on 5% better than Netflix's 
<br>
algorithm, corresponding to a root mean squared error of .90.  (I 
<br>
haven't taken a potshot at this problem yet, but it's quite interesting 
<br>
to see how things go.  Right now, the current leading algorithm, beating 
<br>
out many serious contenders, is apparently one that was rejected from 
<br>
the NIPS conference as uninteresting.  Hence the name, &quot;NIPS Reject&quot;.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, the first two posts from the above thread are just... beautiful. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People sure are fast to give up, aren't they?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winsteps:
<br>
<p>The leaderboard has stalled at .90. It seems that super-powered 
<br>
computers combined with super-descriptive algorithms may be reaching 
<br>
their maximum predictive power.
<br>
<p>There is a historical parallel. Imagine that we had given 100,000,000 
<br>
astronomical observations to astronomer Claudius Ptolemy around 130 A.D. 
<br>
He would have come up with an astrolabe able to describe the past 
<br>
motions of the known planets very accurately. But it would not be so 
<br>
capable of predicting the future motions of those planets. The reason is 
<br>
that his Earth-centered theory of planetary motion was deficient.
<br>
<p>It took Copernicus, then Newton, then Einstein, to develop better 
<br>
theories of planetary motion. Copernicus theorized that the Sun is the 
<br>
center of planetary circles. This is more substantively accurate than 
<br>
that the Earth is at the center, but Copernicus's circle-based 
<br>
predictions of the locations of the planets were less accurate than 
<br>
Ptolemy's, as were also Newton's first ellipse-based predictions.
<br>
<p>So now we have the same situation with the Netflix data. It seems that 
<br>
the super-descriptive algorithms are based on deficient psychometric 
<br>
theory. (Psychometry is the branch of psychology that deals with these 
<br>
types of data). In the past 100 years, several psychometric theories 
<br>
have been developed, but these appear to be at the Copernicus or early 
<br>
Newton stages of development. Applying them to the Netflix data does not 
<br>
yield as good results as the Ptolemaic super-descriptive approach.
<br>
<p>It seems that we need a psychometric Newton, or even an Einstein, to 
<br>
raise the prediction of ratings  to a higher order of accuracy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ummon:
<br>
<p>Dude, with all due respect it's been only several weeks since the start 
<br>
of the contest.  Drawing analogies with Copernicus is all good and nice 
<br>
but there is no way the winning algorithm doesn't exist today.
<br>
