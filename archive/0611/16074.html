<p>What this competitive landscape would look like is extremely difficult to
<br>
make strong predictions about. A lot of it depends on your definition of
<br>
'multiple'. For larger numbers of AIs, co-operation becomes more and
<br>
more viable (and eventually, essential) for competing against AIs at a
<br>
similar level of development. That said, the only way I can see this coming
<br>
about is through a badly designed AGI splintering while undergoing takeoff
<br>
(which is fairly plausible if it's Internet-distributed).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet clearly mutations that involve destroying and/or using the resources of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (potential) competitors are often adaptive. Thus, AGIs that are not only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unFriendly but downright aggressive will emerge. 
</em><br>
<p>There isn't /necessarily/ any correlation between how the AGI treats other
<br>
AIs and how the AGI treats humans (more properly a distinction between
<br>
classes of sapient and sapient goal systems). A well designed goal
<br>
structure can differentiate between these, but an 'emergent' one may do
<br>
almost any kind of generalisation. While analogies to humans are usually
<br>
ill-advised, I'd note that neither human co-operative nor competitive
<br>
drives extend to ants; generally we just wipe them out when they get in
<br>
the way. Humans would get in the way a lot during a nanowar (and any
<br>
AGI trying to save /physical/ humans would probably be at a huge
<br>
disadvantage).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose that in a hard takeoff, the leading AGI could gain so much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (possibly Friendly) power to make all questions moot.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it would make external competitive dynamics irrelevant. I'd guess
<br>
that (unstructured) internal competitive dynamics tend to get stripped
<br>
out once deliberative self-modification becomes available, there almost
<br>
certainly are metastable goal systems that never settle down to a
<br>
coherent optimisation targets, but I suspect they're rare.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But otherwise, doesn't the above suggest that we do have some idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the direction in which AGIs will tend to develop within the space of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible intelligences, and that it's not a good one?
</em><br>
<p>Somewhat, but unFriendliness from a single AI that simply ends up with
<br>
human-incompatible goals seems a lot more likely to me.
<br>
<p>P.S. Good short story on a seed AI; <a href="http://qntm.org/transit">http://qntm.org/transit</a>
<br>
<p>Many of the other stories on the same site are quite interesting.
