Pascal's wager doesn't break down nicely into a single fallacy; it
depends on how you look at.  I would generally classify it as invalid
first-order logic, but I can see how one could also deconstruct it as a
syllogistic fallacy.

Yes, that's why it appeared to be a bizarrely constructed false
analogy.  It wasn't clear why it was even mentioned.  Mostly though, the
definitions used were so loose that it raised the specter of being
invalidated first-order logic by way of ambiguity.

Perhaps, but this was mostly just my interpretation of what you wrote. 
Apparently I read it differently (or was using different definitions)
than you intended. Some fallacies can be construed as such by the simple
fact of skewed premises, lacking rigorous construction.
