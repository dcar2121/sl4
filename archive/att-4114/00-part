Someone actually sent this to me a couple days ago, though I hadn't
gotten around to posting it to the list yet.  I was actually very
pleased to see that the wording of the announcement suggested that the
author has a fairly deep understanding of the real problems and issues. 
Even in the nominal AI community, I sometimes wonder if people really
understand the underlying issues, but these DARPA fellas seem to "get
it".

It looks quite interesting, and I've been mulling over some possible
proposals myself.
