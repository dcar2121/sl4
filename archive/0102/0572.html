Eliezer,
<br>
If you want to publish a book cheaply and to have the potential for wide
<br>
distribution at low cost, then the best way to publish a small book today is
<br>
via electronic/on-demand publishing.
<br>
<p>Below is a list of electronic and print-on-demand publishers. Each one
<br>
offers different terms and conditions for publication. Examine the
<br>
trade-offs between cost to you (ranging from nothing to several hundred
<br>
dollars), copyright (most give it to you; some demand it for themselves),
<br>
and hard copy printing arrangements. I think you'll find that one or more of
<br>
these companies can give you what you want for far less than a conventional
<br>
vanity press.

Subject: How does one publish a short book?
<br>
<p>Several people have been bugging me, or in some cases simply assuming,
<br>
that &quot;Friendly AI&quot; should be published in book form.  I'm not committing
<br>
to anything, but I do see that it might be a little hard on the eyes to
<br>
read it in Web form - that people have more patience to thoroughly read
<br>
the &quot;dead tree&quot; publishing format - and so I'm willing to look into it.
<br>
<p>How does one go about publishing a small, short nonfiction technical
<br>
book?  Does anyone here have any experience?
<br>
<p>Failing that, does anyone have experience with getting technical papers
<br>
bound up as minibooks - not the kind that gets sold in stores, but the
<br>
kind that you hand out to your friends?  (I.e. Robert Freitas handing out
<br>
bound copies of the regular paper _Some Limits to Global Ecophagy_ at the
<br>
Foresight Gathering; long thesis papers with spiral wires through the
<br>
spine.)  Would anyone care to recommend a good online bindery that handles
<br>
small jobs or microjobs?
