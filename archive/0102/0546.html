<p>
Regarding Evolution:
<br>
<p>I have to say that I've been a great admirer of the power of evolution
<br>
having read Dawkin's &quot;Selfish Gene&quot; and Dennet's &quot;Darwin's Dangerous
<br>
Ideas&quot; among others. I also attended ALife '94 and saw some jaw
<br>
dropping presentations by Danny Hillis and Karl Sims as well as
<br>
dabbling with Cellular Automata a tiny bit myself a long time ago.
<br>
<p>However, after thinking about Eliezer's position, if I had to pit
<br>
&quot;Vanilla Evolution&quot; against &quot;Intelligence + Evolution (as a toolkit)&quot;
<br>
I'd agree with Eliezer and put my money on the latter. Evolution is
<br>
powerful, but it doesn't learn from its mistakes. (Searching+Infernece
<br>
Chaining+Caching+ WhatEverTheSIComesUpWith) in *conjunction* with
<br>
evolution just seems more powerful to me. It sounds to me like Ben
<br>
Goertzel is going to evolve competing intelligences. If you just add
<br>
an Intelligent Supervisor (IS) that learns, improves and reruns the
<br>
simulations (and you do it right) I think that system will do better
<br>
than pure evolution (even better than evolution + &quot;all that simulated
<br>
annealing and parasite modelling and whatever else is the state if the
<br>
art these days&quot;).
<br>
<p>In fact, you could have the supervisors compete: which ever supervisors
<br>
construct the fastest learning community get bred and go on to the
<br>
next round. At some point, when they are getting pretty good at this,
<br>
give each of the best and brightest The Current Simulation of Themselves
<br>
and stand back (however, don't forget to give them a copy of Eliezer's book
<br>
on Friendliness first :-). Intelligent strategies, I'm assuming, will
<br>
converge (backward chaining is great, it should pop up at some point
<br>
and once it does, it's there to stay...until improved, or maybe there's
<br>
something better). 
<br>
<p>Well, that would just be for fun of course. There are probably faster
<br>
ways of building a SeedAI. Right?
<br>
<p>===
<br>
<p>Ok, now regarding Friendliness (Samantha's posts got me thinking along
<br>
these lines):
<br>
<p>I understand how the Pol Pots, Adolf Hitlers and Jeffrey Dahmers
<br>
will have limitations placed on enacting their desires. There is 
<br>
however a vast sea of gray between Friendliness and Unfriendliness.
<br>
<p>Consider the following scenario:
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;A Sadist, A Masochist and an Friendly, Omnipotent Sysop walk into a bar...&quot;
<br>
<p>The Cast:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S(adist) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M(asochist)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sysop, the Friendly, Omnipotent, Laissez-Faire type
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I(nnocent)[1..N]
<br>
<p>Act I:
<br>
<p>A Sadist, A Masochist and an Friendly, Omnipotent Sysop walk into a bar and
<br>
sit down to have a drink. Some Innocents are sitting at the other end of the 
<br>
room.
<br>
<p>M: So, S, don't you think you'll ever get tired of being a sadist?
<br>
<p>S: I don't think so. I tried the Violence Patch and that only worked
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a little while until I decided I didn't need it any more. Boy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was I wrong. But I didn't apply it again. Still looking for those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old thrills I guess. Nice piece of software though. Thanks Sysop.
<br>
<p>Sysop: Don't mention it.
<br>
<p>M: What about true to life simulations? Have you tried 'em? Didn't you become
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so bored, that they seemed unappealing.
<br>
<p>S: Yes and no. I mean they worked, but soon I craved really hurting other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sentients again, since I knew that the simulations were totally fake, just
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high fidelity input signals. I got The Rush and everything, but after awhile
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it faded. I'm still looking for a good masochist in real life, but I guess
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll have to do in the mean time.
<br>
<p>M: Snide remarks aside, it was a good thing we found each other. That party
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tonight sounds great, too.
<br>
<p>S: Yeah. Hey, look at the time. My dry cleaning! Go pick it up for me and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet me back at my place around 7pm. 
<br>
<p>M: Anything you say sweetie.
<br>
<p>M leaves.
<br>
<p>S: Sysop, do you see that attractive person over there?
<br>
<p>Sysop: You mean I1?
<br>
<p>S: Yes. Would you create a custom invitation to the S&amp;M party tonight that is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tailored to I1. It should maximize I1's curiosity and desire to attend.
<br>
<p>Sysop: Done.
<br>
<p>S: Send it.
<br>
<p>Sysop: Done.
<br>
<p>S: You worm &lt;chuckle&gt;
<br>
<p>Sysop: Oh puh-lease...
<br>
<p>S: Say my name.
<br>
<p>Sysop: &quot;S&quot;
<br>
<p>S: Say it again.
<br>
<p>Sysop: &quot;S&quot;
<br>
<p>S: Call me &quot;Master&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sysop: Master, your invitation was rejected.
<br>
<p>S: Well *your* invitation obviously sucked. Ok, keep trying the other people 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over there until one accepts.
<br>
<p>(pause)
<br>
<p>Sysop: I2 accepts.
<br>
<p>I2 approaches them at the bar and sits down.
<br>
<p>S: Can I buy you a drink?
<br>
<p>I2: Sure. Your party invitation was quite compelling. I1 warned me not to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go, but I'm pretty sure I can handle it.
<br>
<p>S: Great. There's an incredible new patch I've come up with. Everyone loves it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you try it, you enjoy being a masochist.
<br>
<p>I2: Really. I don't know if I'd like that. I mean I might, but I don't know.
<br>
<p>S: Oh, but that's the point, you'll really like it because you get rewired.
<br>
<p>I2: I can undo it later, right Sysop?
<br>
<p>Sysop: Yes, you can. You are free to do what you want as long as you don't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hurt anyone who doesn't want to be hurt.
<br>
<p>S: Yeah, you always have that option, but everyone I've met has kept
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing it. Sysop and I come up with upgrades every so often. They're
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not that expensive either. Those ersatz stimulations have nothing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the real thing. Everyone loves them and can't get enough. I have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a very high Reputation Rating. Check it out.
<br>
<p>I2: I did. I'm very impressed.
<br>
<p>S: So we'll see you tonight then?
<br>
<p>I2: I'll be there.
<br>
<p>S: You can invite your friends too...You don't mind if I send them an 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invitation, do you?
<br>
<p>I2: Not at all. I'm sure some of them would like to try this out. We're always
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking for The Next Big Thing.
<br>
<p>S: Well this is it, lemmetellya.
<br>
<p>I2: Ok, see you tonight. Thanks S, it was a pleasure meeting you.
<br>
<p>End of Act I
