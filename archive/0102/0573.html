<em>&gt; How does one go about publishing a small, short nonfiction technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book?  Does anyone here have any experience?
</em><br>
<p>It's hard.  From the technical publisher's point of view, the costs are pretty
<br>
much constant per title they publish-- editing, design, sales, distribution
<br>
and binding are all costs that don't much depend on how thick the book is.
<br>
But from the buyer's point of view, the value of a book, and hence the
<br>
acceptable price,  is roughly proportional to its thickness.  So the only thin
<br>
technical books that are efficient to sell are those that are visibly of high
<br>
quality to the purchaser, i.e. those by big-name authors or on hot topics. And
<br>
(not to disrespect you or anything) a first book on building a friendly AI
<br>
doesn't qualify on either count.
<br>
<p>If you had a 300-page tome on the topic, you would have a better chance.
<br>
<p>If you published it as an article in a hardcopy journal, you could hit them up
<br>
for 'offprints'-- some technical journals will print up a number of copies of
<br>
an article and bind them, and provide them to the author at cost.  Actually,
<br>
they might not do this any more.  They did it back in the '80s, but in this
<br>
modern age of desktop printing it might not be needed any more.  But
<br>
publishing in a peer-reviewed journal might be valuable, both because it will
<br>
provide you with experience in dealing with the Establishment, and because it
<br>
will force the Establishment to notice you.
<br>
<p>I have done both of these things, so I speak from experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Failing that, does anyone have experience with getting technical papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bound up as minibooks - not the kind that gets sold in stores, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind that you hand out to your friends? ... Would anyone care to recommend a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good online bindery that handles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small jobs or microjobs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you're willing to pay for printing and binding, you can get anything up to
<br>
a professional-looking book from companies right there in your city.  It's
<br>
just a question of cost.  I would warn against doing it online.  Printers
<br>
range from scrupulous craftsmen to malevolent fools, and you can't tell one
<br>
from the other until you see their work.  The usual procedure is to walk into
<br>
the print shop with a file in some common format, and pick a bunch of options
<br>
from examples they show you (binding, paper, etc).  Then they make up the
<br>
first copy, you go in and look at it and fix anything that's wrong, and then
<br>
tell them to make 500 of them, or whatever.  You really need physical contact
<br>
with them during this process, in case you get a malevolent fool, or even a
<br>
scrupulous craftsman who misunderstands your desires.
<br>
<p>I would warn against the Sir Speedy branch in Framingham, Massachusetts, but
<br>
that doesn't do you much good.
