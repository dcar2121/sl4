<em>&gt; Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only in minds, but in general we see that there is emergent behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even outside of living systems there is emergent behavior.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at crystels, they contain complex patterns that develop out of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few ridges.  On a much larger scale, planets organize themsleves into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems around stars and stars organize into galaxies and galaxies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into clusters and so on.  When we look at the universe, it always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grows to levels of more and more order.  From this, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable to state that minds will always emerge and that they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely work the way they do on Earth.  Why?  For the same reason that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stars in one galaxy behave the same way as those in another:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symmetry.  Unless symmetry is proven to be broken in some way, all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds will eventually work the same way (though the intermediary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steps may vary a bit).  Personally, I doubt that symmetry would bend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for something like the mind, which is just much better organized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, when it has proven ridge with unorganized and somewhat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organized matter.

One way to think of the problem is whether minds are all of a species or a
<br>
genus. If minds are all of a species then your elaboration of the celestial
<br>
analogy holds. If minds form a genus then from your celestial analogy we
<br>
might have to say that what develops are different types of minds,
<br>
supernovaminds, neutronminds, blackholeminds, darkminds, etc. (Or to scale
<br>
it down, gravityminds, electromagnetic minds, strong and weak minds). Which
<br>
it is I don't know. But the conservative hypothesis when coding an AI would
<br>
be to assume the genus hypothesis so as to be vigianlt that it is friendly.
<br>
<em>&gt; But we do have enough data to make conclusions about the universe (at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least this part of it) in general, which minds are a part of and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must, therefore, conform to.  &gt;
</em><br>
If minds are but a species then perhaps we have some reason to suppose that
<br>
our conclusions about the universe are reasonably complete. However, if
<br>
minds form a genus then we have to worry about how complete our description
<br>
of the universe is. (How does the universe look from the point of view of
<br>
another species of mind?) To argue from the completeness of our physical
<br>
description to the species view of mind seems to prejudge the issue. To
<br>
argue from the species view of mind to the completeness of our physical
<br>
description seems to prejudge the issue. Mark.
