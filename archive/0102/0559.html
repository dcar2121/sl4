<p>I have and am not satisfied.  To quote how you left the matter:
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;  No.  Others can go outside who may have more nefarious motives.  Are you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  remorse, never seek to undo some part of the painful ugly creatin they
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Some would, some wouldn't.
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>What kind of answer is this supposed to be?  Your answer is that some 
<br>
will step outside of the FriendlyOS or not enter at all and be evil, 
<br>
possibly to the point where they destory everything else (or maybe 
<br>
even themselves; see the scenario in my previous post), and that's 
<br>
how it is?  If there were no FriendlyOS, everyone might have to keep 
<br>
worrying about everyone else, but at least it would make sure that no 
<br>
one could do something without at least the possibility of noticing 
<br>
their actions, whereas everyone in the FriendlyOS will be so busy in 
<br>
their VRs not to even care about physical reality.  The Sysop may 
<br>
have a lot of power, but ve is just a finite entity like the rest of 
<br>
us, even with the Singularity, and as such at some point can't do any 
<br>
more, inside or (more importantly) outside of the FriendlyOS.
<br>
<p>Samantha tries to offer a response, but it just assumes that SIs get 
<br>
tired of something.  But, depending on programming, this might never 
<br>
happen.
