<p>Well, duh!  I think that the military is more interested in clones. 
<br>
This is bad, but think about /Star Wars/ and the Storm Troopers. 
<br>
While the movies leave it up in the air as to where they come from, I 
<br>
have always suspected that they are spawned humans.  Now, why not 
<br>
just use robots with AIs controlling them?  Well, AIs get smarter, 
<br>
but humans only get so smart.  Now, I'm sure George Lucas wasn't 
<br>
thinking of this when he made the films, but it does make sense.
<br>
<p>The thing that Singulatarians really have to watch out for is the 
<br>
military threat to the creation of SIs.  The reason being that an SI 
<br>
could eliminate a threat like the military before the military could 
<br>
scramble a single jet.  If you want, compare this to the military's 
<br>
struggle to keep crytopgraphy out of the hands of the masses, only 
<br>
with much higher stakes.  Fortunately, SIs and the Singularity have 
<br>
an advantage, in that they will develop faster than the military can 
<br>
react to.  By the time they realize what is going on, it will be too 
<br>
late.
<br>
<p>To that extent, going back to the first post in this thread, it would 
<br>
probably be a good idea not to let the military in on SI development. 
<br>
In fact, we should probably encrypt messages about the creation of an 
<br>
SI (not the theoretical discussions we have now but the practical 
<br>
ones that will take place in the weeks and months before one comes 
<br>
into existance).  When the first SIs come into existance, whether via 
<br>
super AIs or dynamic posthumans, it will be essential that they have 
<br>
the upper hand or the element of surprise.  In other words, let's let 
<br>
the cat out of the bag before someone has a chance to tie the strings 
<br>
shut.
<br>
<p>Now, Eliezer may come back and tell me and everyone else why this is 
<br>
not, but I would not put it past the military or any part of the 
<br>
government to create a dystopian society just to prevent SIs and the 
<br>
upset of power that they will bring.  Let's face it:  this has more 
<br>
or less been the story of Latin America (someone comes along with a 
<br>
good way to run a country, and, bam, the US military creates a 
<br>
dystopia, or as close as they can get to one, to make sure that 
<br>
nothing changes, even if it would be for everyone's net benefit).
