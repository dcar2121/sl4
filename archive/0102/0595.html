<p>
Hello all,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As suggested on the listpage I am introducing myself.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wandered over here from Extropia and the Fountain Society
<br>
&nbsp;in the hopes of finding some more productive brainstorming going on.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I reside in DC. I'm probably a SL3 on Eli's scale.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am finishing up a degree in biology and philosophy after a
<br>
period of &quot;independant reflection&quot; in my early 20s. After a stint
<br>
navigating aircraft and finishing up a Master's in Space Studies
<br>
I'm going to med school. I am finding that a medical education
<br>
is essential for understanding the publications on preventative
<br>
and gerontological medicine neccessary to actualize medical
<br>
immortality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I suspect most of the people on this list are, I am bright.
<br>
How bright is a good question since my readings in psychometry
<br>
seem to indicate intelligence beyond the top half of the 99th percentile
<br>
is difficult to quantify.  The study of intelligence, it's quantification,
<br>
amplification, and expression is a personal passion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a voracious reader and intellectual omnivore.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a rabid enthusiast of Qing Dynasty  neijiaquan martial arts,
<br>
Ba Gua Zhang in particular.  Much of my interest in respiratory physiology
<br>
and
<br>
transformative/adaptive anatomy reflects my interest in rationalizing and
<br>
expanding the classic concept of Ch'i.  I am also deeply interested
<br>
in exploring the neglected areas of tactile sensation and it's neural basis
<br>
in electrophysiology and entrainment of rational hyper-efficent movement
<br>
patterns.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a pet transhuman project I am planning that I rant about from
<br>
time to time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tend to emotionally favour superhuman intelligence built on genetic
<br>
improvements and biotechnology or cyborg style wetware/dryware
<br>
combinations. Perhaps this is a meat fetish.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one reason why I suspect I am only at SL3.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding that this may be connected to my relative ignorance
<br>
in matters infomatic I am working to remedy this. As is E's
<br>
&quot;CaTAI&quot; is rather impenetrable to me. But give me time. :)
<br>
<p>If I missed any of the usual intro points tell me and I will elaborate.
<br>
