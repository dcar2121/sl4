<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently corresponded with a military analyst about the artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence and SI. But it made me wonder, what are people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about the desirability of maximizing or minimizing awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; military establishment about the implications of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superintelligence? My own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; inclination (which I'm not 100% confident in) is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about it; and the same goes for nanotechnology.
</em><br>
<p><p>To answer your question more directly: These guys are definitely VERY aware
<br>
of
<br>
the implications of these advanced technologies, but they don't consider
<br>
them to be
<br>
quite near-term enough to merit their own focused attention, yet.  They have
<br>
a lot
<br>
of near-term problems to solve and as soon as they judge that nanotechnology
<br>
or superintelligence
<br>
is within, say, 3-5 years of helping them solve their problems, ~then~
<br>
they'll jump on the
<br>
appropriate bandwagon.  Meanwhile, they'll just watch and wait...
<br>
<p>Unless someone starts spreading a rumor that the KGB is pursing
<br>
nanotechnology research ;&gt;
<br>
<p>Of course, I don't make these statements with absolute confidence; these are
<br>
just my impressions
<br>
based on talking to some researchers from the intelligence community....
<br>
Perhaps others in some deeper
<br>
layer of some secret bureau are working on grand projects, unbeknownst to
<br>
the researchers I met....  I'd
<br>
guess not, but...
<br>
<p>Anyway, these guys are definitely making a lot of advanced
<br>
cyber-surveillance technology.
<br>
Think &quot;Back Orifice, government style...&quot;.
<br>
<p>(BTW, did you know they also have a hand-held scanner that they
<br>
can aim at you and thus see through your clothes?  The images don't look
<br>
terribly sexy, but they show if you're
<br>
carrying hidden weapons, etc.  When the cost comes down, these will replace
<br>
metal detectors in airports.)
