<p><em>&gt; 1. The 'problem of superintelligence' can be separated into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two subproblems, the &quot;general theory of self-enhancement&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the &quot;problem of the initial conditions&quot;. The first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subproblem is a problem in theoretical computer science,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the second is an ethical and political problem.
</em><br>
<p>At least it is a workable division of the two main bugaboos in the
<br>
discussion. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 2. Self-enhancement: It seems likely to me that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an optimal strategy of intelligence increase which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be bettered except by luck or by working solely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a particular problem domain, and that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy is in some way isomorphic to calculating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successive approximations to Chaitin's halting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability for a Turing machine given random input.
</em><br>
<p>Why is this isomorphic to Chaitin approximations? I might have had too
<br>
little sleep for the last nights, but it doesn't seem clear to me.
<br>
<p>I'm not as certain as you are that there exists an unique optimal
<br>
strategy. Without working within a certain problem domain the no free
<br>
lunch theorems get you. Taking the problem domain to be 'the entire
<br>
physical universe' doesn't really help, since you also have to include
<br>
the probability distribution of the environment, and this will be very
<br>
dependent not just on the interests but also actions of the being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. If this is so, then once this strategy is known,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; winning the intelligence race may after all boil down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hardware issues of speed and size (and possibly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues of physics, if there are physical processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can act as oracles that compute trans-Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions).
</em><br>
<p>What if this strategy is hard to compute efficiently, and different
<br>
choices in initial conditions will produce noticeable differences in
<br>
performance?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5. Initial conditions: For an entity with goals or values,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence is just another tool for the realization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of goals. It seems that a self-enhancing intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could still reach superintelligence having started with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost *any* set of goals; the only constraint is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pursuit of those goals should not hinder the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-enhancement.
</em><br>
<p>Some goals are not much helped by intelligence beyond a certain level
<br>
(like, say, gardening), so the self-enhancement process would peter
<br>
out before it reached any strong limits.
