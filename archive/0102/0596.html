Eliezer,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am more of a biomedicine geek than an infosystems geek. I am still
<br>
running ...well I won't admit what I run on my puter (::wince::).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can however assure you that UNLESS
<br>
your commentary on the difficulties inherent in constructing near-human
<br>
and transhuman AI are utterly spurious
<br>
&nbsp;then the Military/Industrial complex will NEVER cook up enough novelty to
<br>
create superintelligent AI. They might &quot;buy&quot; it but would never be able
<br>
to &quot;build&quot; it!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The DoD/contractors  probably will invest heavily in pre-superintelligent
<br>
AI.
<br>
&nbsp;It's just a better way to organize, which the mil DOES understand all too
<br>
well.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the theory here is that you have to be absolutely sure the sword will
<br>
not
<br>
turn on you before you let it loose.  Militaryfolks are paid to be paranoid.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If an superintelligent AI could not be utterly guaranteed to be loyal it
<br>
would not be funded.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go so far as to say the military programmers would deliberately use
<br>
less than optimal AI rather than run ANY risk that the &quot;tool&quot; would be
<br>
disloyal.

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         [My guess as to your intended meaning]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I meant that - even assuming you can build a totally tame SI -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ve still has no military applications.  If SIs that are &quot;toollike&quot; rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than &quot;mindlike&quot; (structured around immediate instructions rather than
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; living thing in Iraq down to bacteria - I can't visualize ver fighting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battle or directing a tank brigade.  There are no military applications of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence because a superintelligence is outside the domain where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;military&quot; makes sense.  Pre-superintelligent AI may have military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applications; superintelligence, as Nick Bostrom meant the phrase, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none.  (Nick Bostrom's original post nowhere states that SI has military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apps; I'm not sure whether this was deliberate.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regardless of what conclusions the military eventually comes to, my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion is that superintelligence is not a military matter.  Any AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is *not* superintelligent is another question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But your questions are still valid, so...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let's assume your meaning is c).  Then I have a question for you.  Which
</em><br>
is:
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why couldn't the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; CIA create a self-modifying AI whose supergoal was &quot;Serve the USA.&quot;
</em><br>
I.e.,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Be Friendly to the USA.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You posit that the supergoal &quot;Be Friendly to Humans&quot; can remain a fixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point throughout the successive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason-driven self-modification events that will constitute the path
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initial AI to superintelligent AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But, I'm not seeing why the supergoal &quot;Serve the USA&quot; couldn't serve as
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equally adequate supergoal, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the perspective of the development of intelligence.  Things like &quot;learn&quot;
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;gather information&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;survive&quot; are subgoals of &quot;Serve the USA&quot; just as they are of &quot;Be
</em><br>
Friendly
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to Humans.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Serve the USA&quot; is compatible with generic supergoal semantics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external reference semantics; I don't think it's compatible with any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater philosophical sophistication on the part of the AI (i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anchor/shaper semantics or causal rewrite semantics).  Subgoals can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convergent given supergoals.  I believe that supergoals can be convergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given a panhuman grounding for philosophy.  If you took &quot;almost any&quot; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and slowly but steadily amped up their intelligence, they would sooner or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later write more or less the same definition of Friendliness - that's what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm hoping for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regardless of whether the complete definition is convergent, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect certain aspects of it to be convergent - for example, symmetry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among all humans as a moral principle.  If you took a military AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmer and started slowly increasing her intelligence, she would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably stop thinking in terms of &quot;Serve the USA&quot; as a supergoal and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start thinking in terms of &quot;Serve the USA&quot; as a subgoal of peace and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom for everyone in the world.  This process might be slow and awkward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the militaryfolk are totally lost to common-sense morality and don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify with the AI - for example, if the AI asks &quot;Is a human life in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; USA really more *intrinsically* valuable than a human life in Iraq?&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the programmers answer &quot;That is your mission priority&quot;; if the AI asks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Wasn't Martin Luther King a nice guy?&quot; and the militaryfolk answer &quot;Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from your perspective.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the AI isn't built to be sensitive to programmer intentions - isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built to be philosophically robust - then ve may never get past vis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original supergoals, and may equally interpret those supergoals to mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Duplicate copies of the USA, as it existed at the time defined, using all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available matter to build as many copies as possible.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Q:  &quot;Can non-Friendly AI or toollike AI be built?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A:  &quot;Not safely.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope that AI never becomes the subject of an arms race - that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity is finished, over and done with, before AI becomes regarded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a national security asset, or regarded as a target of acquisition by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence agencies.  Failing that, I hope that military organizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are smart enough to develop AIs that serve their home country as a subgoal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Friendliness - rather than compromising planetary security by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromising sensitivity to programmer intentions.  Failing that, I hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the military researchers are so dumb that their AIs are not competitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with those developed by those organizations that are smart enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embrace Friendliness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Failing that, we're screwed.
