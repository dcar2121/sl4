</em><br>
<em>&gt;Including the static uploads, the benevolent superintelligences, and the

<em>&gt;unfiltered communications from you if you make yourself a malevolent SI,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But what do you plan to do to control the SIs that are outside of 
<br>
this OS?  Sure, maybe 99% of the SIs will want to live in FriendlyOS, 
<br>
but some will choose, when uploaded, to stay outside of the OS.  Now 
<br>
fine, those in FriendlyOS might choose to ignore such outsiders, but 
<br>
they will not be able to ignore them if they did something in the 
<br>
physical world.  For example, let's say that all the SIs are busy 
<br>
living in FriendlyOS, going about their simulations and enjoying the 
<br>
altruism of the Sysop.  Meanwhile, I and EvilJoe decide that we don't 
<br>
want to be part of FriendlyOS, so we build our own, independent 
<br>
computers to upload ourselves to.  Then, after the brain scan, being 
<br>
turned into code, and a few subjective centuries of self code 
<br>
enhancement, both of us are equivilant technologically to anything 
<br>
found in FriendlyOS.  With a little more work, we get better, and 
<br>
since the SIs inside FriendlyOS won't listen to us, they fail to 
<br>
realize that we have become super powerful in the physical world. 
<br>
One day, I'm doing some kind of post humanish thing, when suddendly 
<br>
EvilJoe announces to the universe that he is going to destroy it. 
<br>
I'm not ready for it, but that's my own fault.  Those in FriendlyOS, 
<br>
though, will have only the Sysop to blame.  By letting them become 
<br>
absorbed in their own world and by letting vis cycles go to being 
<br>
altruistic towards SIs in the FriendlyOS, ve is unable to cope with 
<br>
EvilJoe's actions.  Thus, EvilJoe kills everything off to be made 
<br>
into whatever ve desires, all because there weren't enough SIs aware 
<br>
of what he was doing to stop him.
<br>
<p>So, how do you propose to deal with this issue?  One, I suppose, 
<br>
would be to come up with some sort of legislation, but that could be 
<br>
too easily avoided.  Another might be to use force to jack everyone 
<br>
into FriendlyOS, but the ethics of this are questionable.  How are 
<br>
you going to preserve Friendliness in a universe where any SI (and 
<br>
not just ones from Earth, mind you) can exist outside and be 
<br>
unFriendly?
