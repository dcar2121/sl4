1. The 'problem of superintelligence' can be separated into
<br>
two subproblems, the &quot;general theory of self-enhancement&quot;
<br>
and the &quot;problem of the initial conditions&quot;. The first
<br>
subproblem is a problem in theoretical computer science,
<br>
the second is an ethical and political problem.
<br>
<p>2. Self-enhancement: It seems likely to me that there is
<br>
an optimal strategy of intelligence increase which
<br>
cannot be bettered except by luck or by working solely
<br>
within a particular problem domain, and that this
<br>
strategy is in some way isomorphic to calculating
<br>
successive approximations to Chaitin's halting
<br>
probability for a Turing machine given random input.
<br>
<p>3. If this is so, then once this strategy is known,
<br>
winning the intelligence race may after all boil down
<br>
to hardware issues of speed and size (and possibly to
<br>
issues of physics, if there are physical processes
<br>
which can act as oracles that compute trans-Turing
<br>
functions).
<br>
<p>4. I haven't at all addressed how to apply superintelligence
<br>
in the abstract to specific problems. I would guess that
<br>
this is a conceptual problem (having to do with grounding
<br>
the meanings of inputs, symbols, and outputs) which only
<br>
has to be solved once, rather than something which itself
<br>
is capable of endless enhancement.
<br>
<p>5. Initial conditions: For an entity with goals or values,
<br>
intelligence is just another tool for the realization
<br>
of goals. It seems that a self-enhancing intelligence
<br>
could still reach superintelligence having started with
<br>
almost *any* set of goals; the only constraint is that
<br>
the pursuit of those goals should not hinder the process
<br>
of self-enhancement.
<br>
<p>6. I think the best observation we have on this topic is
<br>
Eliezer's, that the utilitarian goal of superintelligence
<br>
can be pursued as a subgoal of a 'Friendliness' supergoal.
<br>
As a design principle this leaves a lot of questions
<br>
unanswered - what, explicitly, should the Friendly
<br>
supergoal be? how can we ensure that it is *interpreted*
<br>
in a genuinely Friendly fashion? how can we harness
<br>
superintelligence, not just to the realization of goals,
<br>
but to the creation of design principles more likely to
<br>
issue in what we really want? - but it's the best starting
<br>
point I've seen. Whether there is such a thing as
<br>
*superintelligence that is not goal-driven* is another
<br>
important question.
