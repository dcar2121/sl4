Eliezer ,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;fine research minds&quot; you refer to are following orders.
<br>
Or else they are transferred to somewhere else in the Maze.
<br>
It is hard for someone outside the system to really &quot;grok&quot;
<br>
the amount of administriva that infects EVERYTHING the
<br>
Fed touchs. Though you may have a vantage point from the
<br>
&quot;outside&quot; I don't.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will grant that dealing with the antiquated computer
<br>
systems in BuMed's area of influence has made me rather
<br>
cynical about military AI attempts. Perhaps unjustifiably
<br>
so. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would point out however that 
<br>
&quot;That is the disaster scenario for military development
<br>
&nbsp;- research minds smart enough to develop AI and superior
<br>
&nbsp;officers dumb enough to screw up Friendliness&quot;
<br>
assumes the dumb officers won't decide to reorganize
<br>
the project along &quot;rational&quot; &quot;service-oriented&quot; lines and
<br>
jack up the development process LONG before the
<br>
AI has an attitude of any sort.  I see this sort of thing
<br>
constantly I tell you! LOL.
<br>
<p>As far as the &quot;military/industrial complex&quot; when I use
<br>
this phrase I mean the &quot;fact&quot; that defense contracters
<br>
and the Defense procurement/administration infrastructure
<br>
are where many career military folks end up after they
<br>
retire. It's just common knowledge. &quot;Don't piss off the
<br>
senior noncoms and officers ...they may be interviewing
<br>
you after you separate.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I work with many folks who joined for just that reason.
<br>
All the senior non-coms weigh this sort of thing when they
<br>
retire. It's just the Way Things Are. From the inside anyway.
<br>
<p>On another note are the line breaks any better?
<br>
