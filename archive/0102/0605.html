Gordon,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Um where do I start....
<br>
&lt;&lt;Well, duh!  I think that the military is more interested in clones&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;Well some military personnel are interested in them. As a means
<br>
of reproduction. :)  This sort of thing is hardly smiled on by
<br>
the Joint Chiefs however. Who are happily married and hoping
<br>
that Junior will attend the Academy just like his father. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise Eliezar is right.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I get to work with lots of interesting types ...and the closest
<br>
thing to &quot;radical transhumanist&quot; research going on is calorically
<br>
restricted monkey colony down the road at NIH. Not that isn't
<br>
FASCINATING stuff of course with mad applications in 
<br>
life extension research.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloning  (in the biomedical as opposed to &quot;whole body
<br>
clone&quot; sense) as a technology is interesting to the military as a 
<br>
&quot;medical&quot; technique..cloning skin grafts and neural tissues
<br>
for use in rehabilitating vets and soldiers who have suffered
<br>
traumas. Possibly stem-cell work for helping out the geriatric
<br>
veterans with degenerative nerve disorders. Especially if it 
<br>
can be done without embryonic destruction. This sort of thing
<br>
is mostly over at NIH and it's associated organs.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military is also vaguely interested in cryo and stasis
<br>
technologies, say if you have a sailor or marine who suffers
<br>
catastrophic wounds while on an isolated duty platform.
<br>
Similarly NASA and the DoD collaborate on telemedicine
<br>
issues. But again ..it's all keyed to the mission.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly Darth Maul though. ..
