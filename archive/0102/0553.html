<p>Can't blame you; I get tired of writing that stuff sometimes.  I

guess I should learn to avoid getting myself into these types of 
<br>
discussions so often.  :-)

<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Okay, now I see what Friendliness is supposed to be.  Or wait, maybe

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Raymond Smullyan:  &quot;Is altruism sacrificing your happiness for the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendly AI:  &quot;No.  Altruism is making decisions that fulfill the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volitional desires of others.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, I think I like that.  Now, my concern is whether a Friendly AI 
<br>
might Friendly verself to death.  Friendliness is begining to sound a 
<br>
lot like Asimov's laws of robotics, which, frankly, just create a 
<br>
slave race that isn't very interesting.  Why should AIs have to be 
<br>
Friendly if post humans won't have it programmed in, though it may or 
<br>
may not be added to their code sometime later?  When I'm uploaded, I 
<br>
don't want to be forced to be Friendly and altruistic.  If I choose 
<br>
to be, that's one thing, but I should be able to keep on living as 
<br>
selfishly as I choose.  I realize that it might create SIs that won't 
<br>
do anything too bad, but it won't be up to them.  Thus, I think I've 
<br>
returned to the issue of how SIs will act if Friendliness is taken 
<br>
away (or, better yet, not there to begin with).  You don't seem to 
<br>
care too much about how you get SIs to behave, so long as they do, 
<br>
but I for one am not a big fan of giving up some liberty because 
<br>
someone else is scared of what one might do.  My guess is that if an 
<br>
SI were going to do something that would destroy the universe we 
<br>
wouldn't be having this discussion right now.  I suppose it is 
<br>
possible that we're going to be the first civilization to do this, 
<br>
but the chances for this seem rather slim to me.
