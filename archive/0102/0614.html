<p>But we do have enough data to make conclusions about the universe (at

least this part of it) in general, which minds are a part of and 
<br>
must, therefore, conform to.  More below.

<p><em>&gt;If life always emerges out of chaos still we would need further

</em><br>
<em>&gt;further proof that they are like the ones on earth.
</em><br>
<p>A valid point, but ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;All that we can conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about minds in general, from the fact that humans think like this, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one species of minds in general think like this. To conclude anything else
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Idealism).
</em><br>
<p>... when dealing with the future, one must always extrapolate.  Not 
<br>
only in minds, but in general we see that there is emergent behavior. 
<br>
Even outside of living systems there is emergent behavior.  If you 
<br>
look at crystels, they contain complex patterns that develop out of a 
<br>
few ridges.  On a much larger scale, planets organize themsleves into 
<br>
systems around stars and stars organize into galaxies and galaxies 
<br>
into clusters and so on.  When we look at the universe, it always 
<br>
grows to levels of more and more order.  From this, it would be 
<br>
reasonable to state that minds will always emerge and that they will 
<br>
likely work the way they do on Earth.  Why?  For the same reason that 
<br>
stars in one galaxy behave the same way as those in another: 
<br>
symmetry.  Unless symmetry is proven to be broken in some way, all 
<br>
minds will eventually work the same way (though the intermediary 
<br>
steps may vary a bit).  Personally, I doubt that symmetry would bend 
<br>
for something like the mind, which is just much better organized 
<br>
matter, when it has proven ridge with unorganized and somewhat 
<br>
organized matter.
