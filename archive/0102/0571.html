</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, that's where the rub is: how do you convert a general problem into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a halting problem in an efficient way? For example, how does &quot;What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions will give me the largest probability of having more than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million dollars within ten years?&quot; or &quot;How do I build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanoassembler?&quot; convert into halting problems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would guess that the sum of work often remains constant in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general case: the amount of work needed to encode a problem into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form solvable by an algorithm and the amount of work in using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm tend to be fairly constant. Intelligence is about finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways of getting around this by exploiting patterns that make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem non-general, such as in mathematical tricks where a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformation makes a hard problem simple. 
</em><br>
<p><p>What a perfect segue into the topic of the Codic Cortex! 
<br>
<p>This is a fascinating thread, but a bit too abstract, so let's
<br>
concretify it:
<br>
<p>Suppose I have a specific problem in a specific domain: I want what
<br>
to assign teachers to classrooms in some effiecient way. There are a
<br>
limited number of classrooms and each teacher has a particular
<br>
schedule (the actual details of this example aren't too important).
<br>
<p>Let's also imagine that we have an SI which devotes some fraction of
<br>
its time &quot;approximating Omega&quot; and has &quot;modules which take general
<br>
problems, encode them as halting problems, and look them up in
<br>
Approximate Omega&quot; (see thread snippets below).
<br>
<p>As some of you probably know, solving the scheduling problem for
<br>
teachers is isomorphic to coloring a graph, that is, one can
<br>
translate the problem of teachers, classrooms and schedules into
<br>
nodes, arcs, and colors (not necessarily in that order). You can
<br>
&quot;color&quot; the graph in the right way and then translate that colored
<br>
graph solution back into the domain of scheduling teachers.
<br>
<p>So now. Let's say we have a module called a Codic Cortex (this is
<br>
Eliezer's term, of course). What does this Codic Cortex do? (I'm 
<br>
hoping for corrections here where ever I misstep) In the same way
<br>
that one's visual cortex processing visual information and
<br>
recognizes traits, the codic cortex processes codic (code, as in
<br>
programming &quot;code&quot;) information and also recognizes traits. 
<br>
<p>My understanding of the Codic Cortex concept is that it can look at
<br>
some code and &quot;intuitively&quot; (in the same sense that my visual cortex
<br>
can &quot;intuitively&quot; recognize my mother's face) know what it does and
<br>
what kind of problem it is, so that it might be optimized.
<br>
<p>We have a problem and a problem solver. Let's go through the steps! 
<br>
Somehow the symbols of teachers, classrooms and schedules are all
<br>
grounded, that is, attached to a vast database of deep meaning
<br>
(eg. Cyc?). Excess information is thrown away (we don't care that
<br>
&quot;Most teachers are older than 13 years old&quot;). That is, we abstract
<br>
only the salient features.
<br>
<p>Let's say we also just happen to have solved the class of problems
<br>
characterized by graph-coloring and can look up the right bit of
<br>
code in our Approximate Omega Index (am I actually making sense?)
<br>
<p>Everyone should see that we have 1) a problem encoded in terms we
<br>
recognize and 2) a solution (sitting in our Omega Index) which we can
<br>
apply if we are only clever enough to recognize that they go together.
<br>
<p>Here's my question (which is actually asking for a clarification):
<br>
<p>Is it also the Codic Cortex which recognizes that the teacher 
<br>
scheduling problem can be mapped to the graph coloring problem,
<br>
which has a known solution?
<br>
<p>If that is not the module, then what module does that? (that is the
<br>
module that interests me most personally). What do the details of
<br>
this module look like?
<br>
<p>This module might do such things as take a signal processing
<br>
problem expressed in the time domain and be able to recognize that
<br>
it can be translated into the frequency domain (where it has a known
<br>
solution involving Fourier transforms and simple addition - an
<br>
important feature being that the solution can be remapped into the
<br>
original problem space). 
<br>
<p>Note that these problem spaces and solution spaces are pretty big
<br>
(right?). Finding matches might involve *combinations* of solution
<br>
transformations, which take longer to find the first time, but can
<br>
fortunately be rembered once found...in fact, can we encode this
<br>
search (this mapping of problem spaces) as a halting problem, and look
<br>
for it in Approximate Omega?
<br>
<p><p><p><p>So now let's say I have a fixed amount of work to do and a highly
<br>
tantalizing thread on sl4 is obstructing my path...

<p>[snip - 5 other interesting theses]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4. I haven't at all addressed how to apply superintelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the abstract to specific problems. I would guess that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is a conceptual problem (having to do with grounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the meanings of inputs, symbols, and outputs) which only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to be solved once, rather than something which itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is capable of endless enhancement.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; From: &quot;Mitchell Porter&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mitchtemporarily@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Codic%20Cortex%20WAS:%20Six%20theses%20on%20superintelligence">mitchtemporarily@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Date: Sat, 10 Feb 2001 05:12:40 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea is that a superintelligence would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 'computational core' which spends its time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximating Omega, and modules which take general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems, encode them as halting problems, and look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them up in Approximate Omega.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Assuming that calculating Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really is a meta-solution to all problems, the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is then: What's more important - solving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment-specific problems which Approximate Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't yet solve for you, by domain-specific methods,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or continuing to calculate Omega? My guess is that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most environments, even such a stupid process as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximating Omega by blind simulation and random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culling always deserves its share of CPU time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Okay, that's a retreat from 'You don't have to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything *but* approximate Omega!' But this is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want a general theory of self-enhancement to tell me -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in what sort of environments will you *always* need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain-specific modules that do something more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consult the Omega module? Maybe this will even prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be true in the majority of environments.)
