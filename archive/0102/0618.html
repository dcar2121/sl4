<p>What I am proposing is that the end result of minds will always be 
<br>
the same thing.  I agree that there may be gravityminds and the like 
<br>
along the say to the paragon mind, but there will be only one kind of 
<br>
paragon mind.  You must disregard the internal workings that get to 
<br>
that point.  No matter whether one views art on a computer screen or 
<br>
from a canvas, the art looks the same.  A mind, regardless of it's 
<br>
underworkings, will be the same.  After a few minutes of moving into 
<br>
the SI realm, the mind should develop to the same end point that it 
<br>
would in any other civilization (of course, there could always be 
<br>
mistakes and one particular SI might misdevelop, but, on the whole, 
<br>
SIs will reach the same end point in mind development).
<br>
<p>Now, if we find that there are many mindish things out in the 
<br>
universe the story will be different (not in the same genus, but each 
<br>
one a genus).  We will have to worry about dealing with something 
<br>
other than a mind, but very much like this.  It may even turn out 
<br>
that we don't have minds at all, but something close to it.  I know 
<br>
I'm being vague, but I'm just starting to formulate these ideas, not 
<br>
to mention a lack of experience with anything other than a mind found 
<br>
on Earth.  Give me a few decades and I'll have the answers.  ;-)
<br>
<p>When coding an AI, why should we have to look out for other mindish 
<br>
things?  If we (I noticed that I've been using 'we' a bit lately, and 
<br>
by 'we' I mean human or human derived AI, SI, etc.) are doing the 
<br>
coding, all that we have experience with are our own minds.  Now, 
<br>
there might be an accident, but when it happens I doubt that we'd be 
<br>
able to know that it's a different mindish thing that we need to deal 
<br>
with differently.  I still haven't bought into the whole Friendliness 
<br>
deal yet (though that may change as I read more of that paper ... ), 
<br>
so, to me, I don't really care if a mindish thing is Friendly or not.
