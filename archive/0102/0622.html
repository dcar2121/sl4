<p>
Hello all. This is my join message.
<br>
<p>I have a Bachelor of Science degree. I majored in Computer Science and
<br>
Philosophy. I'm currently applying to go back to school in september to take
<br>
an additional 2 year degree to become a high school teacher in those
<br>
specialities.
<br>
<p>My area of specialization in Computer Science was Artificial Intelligence.
<br>
Which means I took a half course in Machine Learning, a half course in
<br>
Expert Systems, and two half courses in more general stuff like planning
<br>
algorithms. It was during this time that E. published CaTAI for the first
<br>
time. Paying attention in class was a little trickier after that :)
<br>
<p>As a result of these studies, I developed a pretty fair idea of the the
<br>
artificial intelligence community thinks &quot;learning&quot; means for computers.
<br>
This fall I took a couple of elective courses from the Faculty of Education
<br>
and tried to figure out what &quot;learning&quot; means when people do it.
<br>
<p>They aren't even close. :)
<br>
<p>If I have any ambitions regarding helping in the design of a transhuman AI,
<br>
it's to learn enough about learning and cognitive development to actually be
<br>
able to create a computer program that can &quot;learn&quot; in some sense even
<br>
vaguely similar to the way humans &quot;learn&quot;.
<br>
<p>You could well ask why, having a degree in Computer Science, I don't get a
<br>
job in that field. I find that, while having successfully graduated and
<br>
having maintained reasonable grades, my interest in computers is much
<br>
broader then any plausible career in information technology or computer
<br>
programming could realistically sustain. The information sector of our
<br>
economy rewards intense specialization of skills to a much greater degree
<br>
then I personally find palatable. I have always seen myself as something of
<br>
a generalist, maintaining a considerable but by no means exhaustive level of
<br>
expertise in a wider array of fields.
<br>
<p>Plus, as bizarre as this sounds for a CompSci grad, I just really don't like
<br>
working with computer networks. :) Maybe it's an aesthetic or something, but
<br>
they just feel somehow, I don't even know the right word for it... empty. I
<br>
know many people who have a passionate love for networking technologies,
<br>
protocols, routers, etc. I just can't do that.
<br>
<p>On the other hand I try to talk to them about neural architectures, or
<br>
wargames, or air traffic control simulations, and their eyes just glaze
<br>
right over. So I guess it takes all kinds.
<br>
<p>In terms of Shock Levels, I'm probably a middling SL3. My first exposure to
<br>
any speculations about singularity-type ideas was in Heinlein's Expanded
<br>
Universe, where he laid out a view of the future as an exponential curve,
<br>
but my first real exposure to what that would /really/ mean came from E.'s
<br>
Staring into the Singularity, which I found as a link from Anders Sandberg's
<br>
Transhumanism page. I can't even remember how I got there. All I remember is
<br>
a distinct sensation of having my eyes blown through the back of head. Just
<br>
like the first time I read Asimov's &quot;The Last Question.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hmmm. That went on for a little longer then I was planning it to. Oh well. I
<br>
don't think it's particularly boring and anyways bandwidth is cheap :)
<br>
I'll probably be mostly lurking here, the way I do on the Extropians list.
<br>
It's a little strange, actually. I know so much more about most of these
<br>
vaguely esoteric topics then the people I know in real life, but when I come
<br>
on the internet and hang out in channels like this it's like I have almost
<br>
nothing to contribute. Everything I know about ultratech I learned from
<br>
these pages, and these forums, and these people.
<br>
<p>Learning is Good.
