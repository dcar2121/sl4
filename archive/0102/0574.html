<em>&gt; &gt; How does one go about publishing a small, short nonfiction technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; book?  Does anyone here have any experience?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's hard.  From the technical publisher's point of view, the costs are pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much constant per title they publish-- editing, design, sales, distribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and binding are all costs that don't much depend on how thick the book is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But from the buyer's point of view, the value of a book, and hence the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable price,  is roughly proportional to its thickness.  So the only thin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical books that are efficient to sell are those that are visibly of high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality to the purchaser, i.e. those by big-name authors or on hot topics. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (not to disrespect you or anything) a first book on building a friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't qualify on either count.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you had a 300-page tome on the topic, you would have a better chance.
</em><br>
<p>That's about what I figured.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're willing to pay for printing and binding, you can get anything up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a professional-looking book from companies right there in your city.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a question of cost.  I would warn against doing it online.  Printers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range from scrupulous craftsmen to malevolent fools, and you can't tell one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the other until you see their work.  The usual procedure is to walk into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the print shop with a file in some common format, and pick a bunch of options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from examples they show you (binding, paper, etc).  Then they make up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first copy, you go in and look at it and fix anything that's wrong, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell them to make 500 of them, or whatever.  You really need physical contact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with them during this process, in case you get a malevolent fool, or even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scrupulous craftsman who misunderstands your desires.
</em><br>
<p>What I would really like is for somebody to be able to order a fast hard
<br>
copy of &quot;Friendly AI&quot; or &quot;Coding a Transhuman AI&quot; for four bucks plus book
<br>
rate - 6.50 total or whatever - and someone else would print it on demand
<br>
and ship it, maybe a spiral-binding 8x11 rather than a glossy-cover
<br>
pocket-paperback, but still a page-flippable hard copy.
<br>
<p>As a member of the Webvan generation, I haven't yet found it necessary to
<br>
buy a car, so I do tend to favor the Internet side of this... but I'll
<br>
probably take your advice when the time comes.
