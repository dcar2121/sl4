<p>Ah.  Well, good enough, then.  I definitely agree that the convergence of
<br>
paragon minds is the most aesthetically pleasing possibility; it's the
<br>
possibility that I personally think I would most enjoy living in; and it's
<br>
the possibility that would most simplify present-day engineering of minds
<br>
in general and Friendliness in particular.
<br>
<p>But alas... well, you know.
<br>
<p>I used to have a simple and beautiful theory of AI goal systems based on
<br>
objective morality.  Now I have a complex theory, based on the idea that
<br>
an AI should be able to handle any possibility at least as well as it
<br>
would be handled by a self-enhancing altruistic human - but I think the
<br>
new theory is equally beautiful.  Which is important, because this is one
<br>
of those instances where beauty really counts.  I'm just about certain
<br>
that any theory of Friendliness which is not beautiful is wrong.  Anyone
<br>
who accepts this should be able to reject any AI motivation theories that
<br>
are based on enslavement, subordination, or other ugly and exploitative
<br>
means, but unfortunately I can give no simple proof of the importance of
<br>
beauty.
<br>
<p>In Friendly AI, the opposite of beauty is called &quot;the adversarial
<br>
attitude&quot;, though this is never stated explicitly.  Maybe it should be.
