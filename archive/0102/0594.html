</em><br>
<p>Actually, I meant that - even assuming you can build a totally tame SI -
<br>
ve still has no military applications.  If SIs that are &quot;toollike&quot; rather
<br>
than &quot;mindlike&quot; (structured around immediate instructions rather than
<br>
supergoals) are possible, you might tell a &quot;toollike&quot; SI to kill every
<br>
living thing in Iraq down to bacteria - I can't visualize ver fighting a
<br>
battle or directing a tank brigade.  There are no military applications of
<br>
superintelligence because a superintelligence is outside the domain where
<br>
&quot;military&quot; makes sense.  Pre-superintelligent AI may have military
<br>
applications; superintelligence, as Nick Bostrom meant the phrase, has
<br>
none.  (Nick Bostrom's original post nowhere states that SI has military
<br>
apps; I'm not sure whether this was deliberate.)
<br>
<p>Regardless of what conclusions the military eventually comes to, my own
<br>
conclusion is that superintelligence is not a military matter.  Any AI
<br>
which is *not* superintelligent is another question.
<br>
<p>But your questions are still valid, so...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's assume your meaning is c).  Then I have a question for you.  Which is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why couldn't the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CIA create a self-modifying AI whose supergoal was &quot;Serve the USA.&quot;  I.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Be Friendly to the USA.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You posit that the supergoal &quot;Be Friendly to Humans&quot; can remain a fixed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point throughout the successive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason-driven self-modification events that will constitute the path from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial AI to superintelligent AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But, I'm not seeing why the supergoal &quot;Serve the USA&quot; couldn't serve as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally adequate supergoal, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the perspective of the development of intelligence.  Things like &quot;learn&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;gather information&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;survive&quot; are subgoals of &quot;Serve the USA&quot; just as they are of &quot;Be Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Humans.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Serve the USA&quot; is compatible with generic supergoal semantics and
<br>
external reference semantics; I don't think it's compatible with any
<br>
greater philosophical sophistication on the part of the AI (i.e.
<br>
anchor/shaper semantics or causal rewrite semantics).  Subgoals can be
<br>
convergent given supergoals.  I believe that supergoals can be convergent
<br>
given a panhuman grounding for philosophy.  If you took &quot;almost any&quot; human
<br>
and slowly but steadily amped up their intelligence, they would sooner or
<br>
later write more or less the same definition of Friendliness - that's what
<br>
I'm hoping for.
<br>
<p>Regardless of whether the complete definition is convergent, I would
<br>
expect certain aspects of it to be convergent - for example, symmetry
<br>
among all humans as a moral principle.  If you took a military AI
<br>
programmer and started slowly increasing her intelligence, she would
<br>
probably stop thinking in terms of &quot;Serve the USA&quot; as a supergoal and
<br>
start thinking in terms of &quot;Serve the USA&quot; as a subgoal of peace and
<br>
freedom for everyone in the world.  This process might be slow and awkward
<br>
if the militaryfolk are totally lost to common-sense morality and don't
<br>
identify with the AI - for example, if the AI asks &quot;Is a human life in the
<br>
USA really more *intrinsically* valuable than a human life in Iraq?&quot; and
<br>
the programmers answer &quot;That is your mission priority&quot;; if the AI asks
<br>
&quot;Wasn't Martin Luther King a nice guy?&quot; and the militaryfolk answer &quot;Not
<br>
from your perspective.&quot;
<br>
<p>If the AI isn't built to be sensitive to programmer intentions - isn't
<br>
built to be philosophically robust - then ve may never get past vis
<br>
original supergoals, and may equally interpret those supergoals to mean
<br>
&quot;Duplicate copies of the USA, as it existed at the time defined, using all
<br>
available matter to build as many copies as possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>Q:  &quot;Can non-Friendly AI or toollike AI be built?&quot;
<br>
A:  &quot;Not safely.&quot;
<br>
<p>I hope that AI never becomes the subject of an arms race - that the
<br>
Singularity is finished, over and done with, before AI becomes regarded as
<br>
a national security asset, or regarded as a target of acquisition by
<br>
intelligence agencies.  Failing that, I hope that military organizations
<br>
are smart enough to develop AIs that serve their home country as a subgoal
<br>
of Friendliness - rather than compromising planetary security by
<br>
compromising sensitivity to programmer intentions.  Failing that, I hope
<br>
the military researchers are so dumb that their AIs are not competitive
<br>
with those developed by those organizations that are smart enough to
<br>
embrace Friendliness.
<br>
<p>Failing that, we're screwed.
