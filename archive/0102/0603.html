This thread is wandering off-topic for SL4.  I hereby veto further
<br>
discussion of the military's general attitude and research competence as
<br>
being more debatable than resolvable.
<br>
<p>In terms of possible intereference, either their attitude is &quot;bah humbug&quot;,
<br>
or not.  In terms of possible independent research, either their research
<br>
totally flops, or something interesting might happen.  I still think this
<br>
is an interesting and appropriate list topic, but try to just make one of
<br>
the preconditional assumptions, one way or the other, so you can get to
<br>
the SL4-specific scenarios.
<br>
<p>My own view is that I'd prefer to see no military involvement at all in
<br>
&quot;real&quot; AI; the possibility of increased funding does not compensate for
<br>
the disadvantages of less open development, not to mention the possibility
<br>
of pitched intelligence-agency battles being fought inside my laboratory. 
<br>
Given military involvement... well, asking an AI to harm humans today for
<br>
the greater good tomorrow is not the *total* ethical meltdown it would
<br>
represent in a human, but it does represent a significant compromise of
<br>
Friendliness.
<br>
<p>If anyone asks me my views on AI and national security, my answer will be
<br>
&quot;no first use&quot; and &quot;no escalation&quot;.  The US should not be the first to
<br>
make AI research projects an intelligence acquisition target.  The US
<br>
should not be the first to use AI for information warfare - not even in a
<br>
defensive capacity, since that would render AI research projects into
<br>
military targets.  While I would reluctantly understand the necessity of
<br>
using automated-weaponry or combat-coordinator &quot;humankiller AI&quot; to defend
<br>
the US *against a similarly equipped enemy*, doing so would still
<br>
represent a serious compromise of Friendliness.  The AI would value enemy
<br>
lives on the battlefield, and might reject the proffered utilitarian
<br>
rationale for specific cases; trying to prevent either of these conditions
<br>
would probably result in a total compromise of Friendliness.  In summary,
<br>
being the first party to compromise Friendliness, for *any* reason, would
<br>
compromise planetary security, regardless of any short-term national
<br>
objectives served.
<br>
<p>I'll fold that up and send it to the NSA, but only if *they* ask me first.
