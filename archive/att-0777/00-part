A major tenet of Buddhism is the doctrine of no-soul (or no-self;
"anatta").

Buddhist teleology posits a time when all beings are Enlightened, which is
to say, all beings have entered Nirvana. But Nirvana itself was never
defined in a postive sense by Gautama Buddha, who preferred to say what it
is not. He defined Nirvana as no clinging, no suffering, etc.

Similarly, the Buddha choose to remain silent when asked certain questions,
such as whether the universe is finite or infinite. When asked why he did
not answer, Buddha responded that he taught only what would help
individuals. He considered speculation to be unhelpful. Therefore, so far
as I know, there is no teaching in Buddhism about an end to the universe.
