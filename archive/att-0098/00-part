Um. Okay. Let me say it this way:

I don't think the AI would go 'bezerk'.

I would hope that it is rational. And kind. Or whatever.

And wouldn't it be smart enough NOT to destroy us?

I never said it would go nuts and kill us all; there is little chance it will.

That's it. I think I get it now. Okay.
