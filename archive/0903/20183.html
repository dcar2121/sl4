<p><em>&gt; &gt; Many-worlds is indistinguishable from the case that

</em><br>

<p>Not exactly. Under many-worlds, universes don't actually &quot;split&quot; because quantum mechanics and general relativity are symmetric with regard to time. The universes were different before the split, but not at the macroscopic level. However, the two universes still had different quantum states.
<br>
<p>Remember that probability is a model of belief, not of reality. In quantum mechanics, the square of the modulus of the wave function fits our model of probability only in the absence of other knowledge. For example, if constraints such as conservation of mass-energy, electric charge, momentum, and angular momentum restrict the possible combinations of  observations we could make, we call that entanglement. As another example, the probability of observing a radioactive decay over one half-life interval is 1/2 only if that interval is in the future. But if you knew the quantum state of the universe, you would know everything about the future and probability would be a meaningless concept.
<br>
<p>The reason we expect a coin to come up heads with probability 1/2 is because of the way our brains compute probabilities based on past experience.
