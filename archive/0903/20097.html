<em>&gt; My point is that ethical beliefs are not the same thing as the truth. I think we both understand that, but it is a difficult point to make. For some reason people continue to argue about what we should do as opposed to what we will do, as if our minds had free will as opposed to being programs.
</em><br>
<p>Let me try to translate the commonsense understanding of &quot;ethical&quot;
<br>
language like &quot;should&quot; into &quot;we-have-no-free-will-speak&quot;.
<br>
<p>Humans are social animals, and can be influenced by the perceptions
<br>
and reasonings of other humans. The human ability to selectively
<br>
accept these influences, to sometimes &quot;be persuaded&quot;, is one of the
<br>
many characteristic features of the species.
<br>
<p>In order for a rational entity (which humans approximate to some
<br>
degree) to be persuaded to action, the message must contain evidence
<br>
of the action's utility.
<br>
<p>Regarding evidence: The only kind of evidence that an untrusted
<br>
message can offer are certificates, for example, proofs. These
<br>
certificates can allow the receiver to quickly replicate and check a
<br>
chain of reasoning that the sender computed. For example, the
<br>
complexity class NP can be defined in terms of these certificates.
<br>
<p>Regarding utility: The utility in question is the _receiver's_ utility
<br>
function, not the sender's.
<br>
<p>A sentence like &quot;You should do X because Y.&quot; might be understood as &quot;I
<br>
am transmitting a certificate (Y) that contains evidence that the
<br>
action (X) will lead to higher values of your utility function, as I
<br>
understand it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Because humans are irrational animals, it is common for flawed
<br>
certificates to be sent, either because the sender made a mistake, or
<br>
because the sender knows that the receiver might make a mistake in
<br>
checking the certificate. Because humans are fuzzy, informal
<br>
reasoners, the &quot;certificates&quot; offered are routinely informal and
<br>
require considerable computation to unpack and check on the receiver's
<br>
side.
<br>
<p>Someone who says &quot;You should accept this radical medical procedure
<br>
because it is analogous to saving your life, which you value.&quot; is
<br>
definitely not claiming that minds have free will as opposed to being
<br>
programs. This is merely one human attempting to persuade another
<br>
human to action.
<br>
<p>If someone else says &quot;You should not accept this deliberate temporary
<br>
induction of clinical death, because it is analogous to killing you
<br>
and creating a different entity from your corpse.&quot;, they're also using
<br>
&quot;ethical&quot; language, but there's still no claim that minds have free
<br>
will.
<br>
<p>Johnicholas
<br>
<p>Note: I was very deliberate in my example. The medical procedure
<br>
discussed might be uploading, or it might be one of the surgeries
<br>
mentioned in &quot;Controlled Clinical Death&quot;.
