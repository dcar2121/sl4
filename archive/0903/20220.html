<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The human brain computes probability based on a model that assumes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories accurately reflect the past and that the past predicts the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose you are given a choice of (A) being tortured, and then having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory of the torture erased, or (B) not being tortured, but then having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false memory of torture programmed into your brain. Our model says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after many trials you will consistently choose (A) even if you prefer not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you knew what was going on you would choose (B). If you didn't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have no reason to choose (B) over (A).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I understood Matt's original position that we would choose A (with the
<br>
caveat that there is no lasting inexplicable physical damage) because the
<br>
consciousness with no memory of the experience is indistinguishable from
<br>
having not had the experience at all.  A memory of fading intensity is still
<br>
much more traumatic than no memory.
<br>
<p>I think it is important to approach this scenario without emotional
<br>
investment in the actual torture experience.  We should discuss only the
<br>
states Matt proposed:  Tortured with no memory (and I added no evidence) vs.
<br>
No torture and vividly detailed memory of torture.
<br>
<p>Along the same line of thought as the crush-your-clone teleporter:  Having
<br>
been told that you are in the group that has received implanted memory of
<br>
torture, you may rid yourself of by actually experiencing the torture you
<br>
already remember (perhaps the memory erasure drugs require this) - Do you
<br>
willingly retain your false memory or voluntarily accept torture as the cost
<br>
of relief from those memories?
