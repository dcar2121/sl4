No! There are other answers, see Johnicholas' list.

<br>
<p>The answer that most are actually worried about is time continuity of 
<br>
the pattern that resides within in the activation states of the brain's 
<br>
neurons (in the *arrangement* of the matter's state space). That does 
<br>
not seem to be too terribly dependent on specific atoms. However it does 
<br>
seem to need to be kept running on the hardware rather continuously to 
<br>
qualify as the same self. As evidenced by coma victims often having 
<br>
seriously changed personalities.
<br>
<p>And that seems _unbelievably_ hard to do quickly enough. I think if the 
<br>
transition was essentially transparent between the old brain and the new 
<br>
brain, to the point that thought processes were indeed continuing in 
<br>
such a way that their hardware was not distinguishable, then it would be 
<br>
an acceptable transition. I mean to say that if a powerful enough 
<br>
simulation of the time evolution of the matter's state space were 
<br>
ongoing throughout the process, I see no reason this would cause any 
<br>
alarm. It happens every night and day.
<br>
<p>I think the discussion of this hypothetical teleportation is rather 
<br>
worthless without the caveat that somehow this pattern of brain activity 
<br>
(and maybe body activity while we're at it, though that's likely a less 
<br>
pressing concern since it's so much slower) is simulated during the 
<br>
building of the new body in a different spatial location. I'd be willing 
<br>
to accept teleportation in this case personally; we have shown that we 
<br>
are not specifically tied to the underlying atoms themselves, but we do 
<br>
seem to need time continuity...

<br>
<p>Yes, Yes, and Yes. This is the key. As we start out at the star-crashing 
<br>
level, we have frustratingly little evidence of the ability of the 
<br>
system to remember us. As we approach human society, then our families, 
<br>
then our body and mind, we remember more and more. This memory is, I 
<br>
believe, what people associate with their selves, in general.
<br>
<p>I believe it is important to consider this on a gradient. In some way, 
<br>
yes, I feel that my self is my light cone and so my potential self is 
<br>
little different from the physical universe itself.

I think this gets very nicely to the question at hand... this seems to 
<br>
be the end of the societally important human self. 5 is on the border, 
<br>
in that our society does recognize it as continuous, but most people 
<br>
would find it a hollow shell of the former. The rest are not societally 
<br>
protected or at all universally accepted.

And the only one that I'm willing to argue with the societally accepted 
<br>
position on is #10: if our cell states are not tied to specific atoms, 
<br>
it seems a long shot that our brain state would be somehow tied to the 
<br>
specific cells (though the internal cell organization and time 
<br>
continuity do both seem to be important).
<br>
<p>The critical caveat is that we cannot be confident of our 
<br>
self-continuity past any time discontinuity in our brain's patterns: 
<br>
that is what we must maintain across any hardware transitions, to 
<br>
guarantee the continuity of memory, the foundation of our self.

catching up on reading now.
