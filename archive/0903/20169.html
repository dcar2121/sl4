I understand that you claim to be conscious, but that doesn't tell me 
<br>
what you are claiming.
<br>
I don't really think that you believe that &quot;seeming to know things that 
<br>
you don't know&quot; is a definition of a separate conscious entity.  That 
<br>
would imply that a table of logarithms was conscious.
<br>
<p>Looking before you leap is quite reasonable, but looking implies 
<br>
searching for some set of features or characteristics.  What you would 
<br>
find satisfactory is quite opaque.
<br>
<p>You are looking at it as &quot;Would an upload be conscious?&quot;, but I'm 
<br>
looking at a simpler(?) problem of &quot;What is required for an AI to be 
<br>
conscious?&quot;  Your problem requires not only that the system be 
<br>
conscious, but that it have the same consciousness (i.e., be the same 
<br>
individual) as the original.

<em>&gt; Could you define the &quot;consciousness&quot; that you are worrying about?  Is there any test for it?  If not, how do I know that *you* are conscious, and not just pretending?  And if there isn't a definition that we can both agree on, isn't the word just a meaningless noise?  If not, why not?

<em>&gt; Not ok. This Dennet, Blckmore take on consciousness is lacking in that it does't help me understand the origin of subjective experience, whether my motives are purely philosophical or engineering oriented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact the statement that conciousness does not add anything is itself pointless: it helps understanding not one bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A super inteligent, but not conscious, AI recieves an upload. The company that owns the AI demos the newly uploaded person to it's family. It passes all sorts of tests - Turing style and White box - the audience concluded that this really is uncle Bert. It does not have a body, it is not a zombie, it is a set of responses that has fooled the room. It may require 10x the processing power of a human brain to run. In this example consciousness is a performance optimization allowing complex behaviour to run on smaller hardware/wetware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uncle Bert is not conscious - this is not irrelevant for people considering the procedure.
