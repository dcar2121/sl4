<br>
<em>&gt;I'm still not certain, but I think that AI/AGI research is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fulfilling thing for me to do with the next 6 years of my life.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt;Lastly, there is the issue of impact upon the future of humanity. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is bad because the human mind (at least my mind) finds it hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cope with the immense cognitive dissonance that is created by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weight of responsibility, and the implication that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant chance that the human race will be wiped out by someone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;uFAI project. Also, merely contemplating the size of the stakes (both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the reward for success, and the penalty for failure) makes you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you are insane.
</em><br>
<p>I've spent the last few years mostly doing things entirely unrelated
<br>
with AGI research.  In my experience, once you're aware of the issues,
<br>
you'll pay the costs listed above whether you do constructive work on
<br>
the issues or not.  So they aren't really costs of working on the
<br>
issues unless the alternative is to completely fill your attention
<br>
with meaningless distractions so you don't think about what's really
<br>
happening.  Apparently I'm not up to that.  I just can't party hard
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>So I think you're doing the right thing.  
<br>
<p>Let me know if you figure out how to get paid.
