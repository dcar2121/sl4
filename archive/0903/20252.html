<p><em>&gt; I'm still not certain, but I think that AI/AGI research is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfilling thing for me to do with the next 6 years of my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do remember that AGI research is a very hard scientific problem. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both a good thing and a bad thing: it is good because it is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting opponent to fight against; even if you fail, you will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;lived&quot; more than if you'd succeeded at some boring, run of the mill piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of almost-settled-science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a bad thing because you will fail a lot, and this will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disheartening. Also, it has a poor intellectual reputation at the moment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though this is improving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lastly, there is the issue of impact upon the future of humanity. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again is a double-edged sword. It is good because you get to feel you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing something really important, and if you are part of an effort that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeeds in creating a positive singularity, not only will you live forever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a very nice world, but you will also be a hero for the rest of the age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe, a kind of eternal celebrity. It is bad because the human mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at least my mind) finds it hard to cope with the immense cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissonance that is created by this weight of responsibility, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implication that there is a significant chance that the human race will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiped out by someone's uFAI project. Also, merely contemplating the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stakes (both the reward for success, and the penalty for failure) makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you think that you are insane. I have found existentialist philosophy to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helpful in this respect: humans must strive to create meaning in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningless universe, and pursuing a mad-sounding but potentially universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saving idea *does* creating meaning, even if the idea really is mad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cc: SL4 list, because others may want to read this advice, and/or comment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It does have a poor intellectual reputation, but to offer a small piece of
<br>
advice (coming from a budding undergraduate), break the AGI problem into
<br>
smaller narrow-AI-ish pieces, then attack them one by one, or all slowly in
<br>
unison under the guise of more practical applications. I am currently
<br>
building a pattern recognition engine to predict stock prices for an
<br>
independent study at my university, but the real motive is to take the end
<br>
product and chuck it into my metaphorical bin of AGI parts.
<br>
<p>As for the impact on humanity, and the universe (as if they are separate
<br>
entities), I totally agree, imagining the future impact is mind-bendingly
<br>
bizarre and difficult at the same time, it's a lot of responsibility.
