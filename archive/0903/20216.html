</em><br>
<p>I would definitely choose B, not being tortured.  Memories of past physical 
<br>
pain do not hurt as much as enduring current physical pain.  I have many 
<br>
memories of past physical pain that were terrible at the time, but don't 
<br>
bother me at all now.  Loading more of these in my head wouldn't bother me a 
<br>
bit.  But enduring real torture would be..., well, torture.
<br>
<p>I am always boggled by people's assertion that if you hide something, it 
<br>
doesn't count.  Erasing my memory of torture does not make it OK.  The 
<br>
knowledge that you can hide all evidence of memory of this crime against me 
<br>
would not encourage me in the least to allow it.
