<p>
I'm still not certain, but I think that AI/AGI research is the most
<br>
fulfilling thing for me to do with the next 6 years of my life.
<br>
<p>Do remember that AGI research is a very hard scientific problem. This is
<br>
both a good thing and a bad thing: it is good because it is a very
<br>
interesting opponent to fight against; even if you fail, you will have
<br>
&quot;lived&quot; more than if you'd succeeded at some boring, run of the mill piece
<br>
of almost-settled-science.
<br>
<p>It is a bad thing because you will fail a lot, and this will be
<br>
disheartening. Also, it has a poor intellectual reputation at the moment,
<br>
though this is improving.
<br>
<p>Lastly, there is the issue of impact upon the future of humanity. This again
<br>
is a double-edged sword. It is good because you get to feel you are doing
<br>
something really important, and if you are part of an effort that succeeds
<br>
in creating a positive singularity, not only will you live forever in a very
<br>
nice world, but you will also be a hero for the rest of the age of the
<br>
universe, a kind of eternal celebrity. It is bad because the human mind (at
<br>
least my mind) finds it hard to cope with the immense cognitive dissonance
<br>
that is created by this weight of responsibility, and the implication that
<br>
there is a significant chance that the human race will be wiped out by
<br>
someone's uFAI project. Also, merely contemplating the size of the stakes
<br>
(both the reward for success, and the penalty for failure) makes you think
<br>
that you are insane. I have found existentialist philosophy to be helpful in
<br>
this respect: humans must strive to create meaning in their meaningless
<br>
universe, and pursuing a mad-sounding but potentially universe saving idea
<br>
*does* creating meaning, even if the idea really is mad.
