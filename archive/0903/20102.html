<p><em>&gt; The teleportation industry might go to great lengths to soundproof the booths so nobody would hear the tormented screams of their customers. Suppose you only found out how it worked after you have used it 100 times. Suppose it costs $100 to teleport anywhere in the world, and for $20 extra you have the option of having the booth filled with a narcotic gas so you die painlessly. How many more times would you teleport before you no longer saw any sense in paying the extra fee?

<p>Subjectively you have a 1/2 chance of suffering when faced
<br>
non-destructive teleportation with painful killing of the original. Of
<br>
course you will have no memory of it if you are the survivor, but
<br>
there is still a 1/2 chance that it will be you suffering next time.
<br>
On the other hand, after teleportation you could torture your copy
<br>
with impunity, since there is never any chance his suffering could be
<br>
in your subjective future. Yes, you could say that it is all just a
<br>
game evolution has programmed us to play, but it's an important game
<br>
for those so programmed.
