<p>Perhaps the following will aid in understanding. If I hard wired your brain to connect the &quot;2+2&quot; neurons to your &quot;5&quot; neurons, you would not ask &quot;what is 2+2?&quot; You would ask &quot;why do...
<br>
<p>Do you think math is memory?
<br>
Maybe at first, but then we spot the patterns.
<br>
<p>Or is it possible that 2+2=4?
<br>
<p>I am with you on this (unless you have tampered with my mind).
