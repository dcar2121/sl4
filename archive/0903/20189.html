Sorry if my posts don't clearly show who wrote what - partly me being sloppy, partly my mail client.

What is required for an AI to be conscious?

I did not write that.



That it be intelligent. That is the strategy that Evolution took and it
successfully produced at least one conscious being, probably more. 

A super inteligent, but not conscious, AI […..]

If you believe that is possible then I can only conclude that you do not
believe in Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. 


What? Why? 
People can atribute consciousness to inanimate objects like cars or teddies or volcanos. I think a complicated machine could fool people but still be inanimate and not self aware. Are you saying that anything that acts clever enough to &lt;insert test here&gt; is conscious?

I think you are saying: algorithmic complexity = inteligence = consciosness. 
This is certainly one hypothosis.
