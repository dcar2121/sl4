<p>Then I guess we are mostly in agreement after all.
<br>
<p>The question &quot;how should we compute the probability of being tortured?&quot; is philosophical and irrelevant. The question &quot;how will we compute the probability of being tortured?&quot; does have an experimentally testable answer.
