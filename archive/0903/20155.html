Thanks for your concise summary. I accept both your points.
<br>
<p>I'm sure then that it's already been asked what happens if two copies are created at the same time, in which one will I continue to experience?
<br>
<p>The world would say 'both', but I cannot experience being in two bodies at the same time.

<em>&gt; &gt; Please excuse me if this has been done to death,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it has been repeatedly discussed on this and many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists, and although some never tire of this important topic others get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; annoyed and might even demand the thread be terminated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I think focusing on the question of whether there is a thing called a consciousness clouds the issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the question is about a continuity of experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To the rest of the world there's no difference, but how could somebody make me believe that my experience would not just cease as I am physically destroyed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your experience would cease, but it would kick in again when your copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is fired up. This is what happens when you walk from A to B: you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappear from the universe at A, and some time later your copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears at B and has much the same experiences as the original at A.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objection: walking retains the same matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Response: metabolic processes replace most of the matter in your body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over months, and you still feel that you're the same person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objection: there is continuity of consciousness in the intermediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stages as you walk from A to B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Response: not if you are anaesthetised and carried.
</em><br>
