I was not linking levels of processing power with conciousness. 
<br>
I was maintaining that there could be a dumb procedural non recursive program that appears conscious through brute force... But is not. Like a rock. 
<br>
I am. A rock is not.

<p>Not ok. This Dennet, Blckmore take on consciousness is
<br>
lacking in that it does't help me understand the origin
<br>
of subjective experience, whether my motives are purely
<br>
philosophical or engineering oriented.
<br>
In fact the statement that conciousness does not add
<br>
anything is itself pointless: it helps understanding not one
<br>
bit.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the following will aid in understanding. If I hard wired your brain to connect the &quot;2+2&quot; neurons to your &quot;5&quot; neurons, you would not ask &quot;what is 2+2?&quot; You would ask &quot;why does 2+2=5?&quot;
<br>
<p>e.g.
<br>
A super inteligent, but not conscious, AI recieves an
<br>
upload. The company that owns the AI demos the newly
<br>
uploaded person to it's family. It passes all sorts of
<br>
tests - Turing style and White box - the audience concluded
<br>
that this really is uncle Bert. It does not have a body, it
<br>
is not a zombie, it is a set of responses that has fooled
<br>
the room. It may require 10x the processing power of a human
<br>
brain to run. In this example consciousness is a performance
<br>
optimization allowing complex behaviour to run on smaller
<br>
hardware/wetware.
<br>
Uncle Bert is not conscious - this is not irrelevant for
<br>
people considering the procedure.
<br>
<p>So lets say that the upload service figures out an optimization that allows Bert to be simulated and pass all the tests as before with 1/10 the computing power. Does that make it conscious? Or are you saying that's impossible because currently the brain does 10% of your thinking and your consciousness (by some mysterious process) does the other 90%?
<br>
<p>Or is it possible that 2+2=4?
<br>
