<br>
<p><em>&gt; if you try to draw a line […]
</em><br>
<p>In the real world one never draws a line, you draw a blob.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; one person posted that they believed that if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were killed instantly during teleportation then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would become the copy but not if they were killed 5 minutes later. 
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I believe that was me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OK, what about 1 minute? At exactly what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; femtosecond boundary is the critical point? 
</em><br>
<p>I also said that I wouldn’t be comfortable with the procedure unless the
<br>
copy was made right now, and “now” is the time it takes to complete a
<br>
thought, about a second, maybe two. I made no claim that this tells us
<br>
anything profound about the universe, it’s just my personal preference.
<br>
I personally don’t like the idea of having a last thought, but you may
<br>
feel differently about it. There is no disputing matters of taste.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if a newly fertilized egg is not conscious, what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about a 3 month old embryo? If an ant is not conscious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what about a dog? 
</em><br>
<p>A 90 pound man is thin, a 900 pound man is fat, but you can not point to
<br>
a precise ounce and say this is where a thin man becomes fat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can always construct a continuum between these cases. 
</em><br>
<p>And I can make a continuum between jet black and blinding white, does
<br>
that mean there is no difference between black a white?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; what about a program that also passes the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing test? By a process of binary search 
</em><br>
<p>What about it?
