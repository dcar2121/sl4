<p><em>&gt; It is impossible for an observer inside the universe to know its state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://politics.randomplayground.net/2009/02/20/wolpert-proves-that-in-any-such-system-of-universes-quantities-exist-that-cannot-be-ascertained-by-any-inference-device-inside-the-system/">http://politics.randomplayground.net/2009/02/20/wolpert-proves-that-in-any-such-system-of-universes-quantities-exist-that-cannot-be-ascertained-by-any-inference-device-inside-the-system/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; To give another example, a computer program with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; observer that branches into two processes, one where the observer sees
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; heads and the other where he sees tails, will be completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; deterministic viewed from outside, but it will seem to the internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; observer that he has a 1/2 chance of seeing heads or tails, even if he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; has full access to the source code and the data.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The program will estimate a probability that depends on how it was programmed. It cannot have full access to the source code and data by the above theorem.
</em><br>
<p>The irreducible randomness of the first person perspective does not
<br>
come from an inability of an observer to fully know the universe's
<br>
state. It is easy to imagine special cases where the observer knows
<br>
everything relevant about the experiment: at 10 AM I will be
<br>
duplicated, one of the copies will see heads and the other copy will
<br>
see tails. In the case of a classical coin toss in a non-branching
<br>
universe, assigning a probability of 1/2 to heads is due to partial
<br>
ignorance: I know how a series of past coin tosses have turned out,
<br>
but I don't know how this particular one will turn out, for if I did I
<br>
would assign heads a probability of either 1 or 0. But in the former
<br>
example although I know exactly what is going to happen, I don't know
<br>
what I'm going to experience.
