<p><em>&gt; Of course there is consciousness... right?

<p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;consciousness&quot;. How would you be different if you didn't have one?
<br>
<p>Of course it doesn't matter how you answer. Either there is a difference that others could detect, or there isn't.
<br>
<p>If there is a detectable difference, then there is no reason that we couldn't create a machine that simulates you and passes whatever test for consciousness you propose.
<br>
<p>If there is no detectable difference, then there is no sense in asking the question.
<br>
<p>I think your real question is &quot;will I die?&quot; which is understandable since we are programmed to fear death.
