<p>
The Singularity Institute and the Future of Humanity Institute are
<br>
beta’ing a new site devoted to refining the art of human rationality,
<br>
LessWrong.com.  LessWrong will end up as the future home of Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky’s massive repository of essays previously written on
<br>
Overcoming Bias - with, we hope some added features to enable much
<br>
easier reading thereof; which is where you come in.
<br>
<p>LessWrong is based off the open-source Reddit codebase and written in
<br>
Python.  The current site is up and running, but there are many
<br>
features remaining to be added.  Volunteer developers for this
<br>
open-source project would be much welcome, especially fast coders
<br>
fluent in Python with large blocks of free time to contribute major
<br>
new modules.
<br>
<p>For more information, see:
<br>
<p><a href="http://wiki.github.com/tricycle/lesswrong/contributing-to-less-wrong">http://wiki.github.com/tricycle/lesswrong/contributing-to-less-wrong</a>
<br>
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1t/wanted_python_open_source_volunteers/">http://lesswrong.com/lw/1t/wanted_python_open_source_volunteers/</a>
<br>
<p>Please note that to prevent topic drift during the establishment of
<br>
Less Wrong, we’ve banned discussion of the Singularity / AGI / FAI
<br>
until May 2009 - the goal of this blog is to create an ongoing
<br>
conversation about human rationality.  If you aren't much interested
<br>
in reading about discussion of human rationality per se, and you just
<br>
want to discuss transhumanist projects, then you're politely requested
<br>
not to comment on Less Wrong.
<br>
<p>But it goes without saying that SIAI and FHI have reasons for
<br>
launching this project - for example, it turns out that it's
<br>
surprisingly hard to convey our arguments to someone who doesn't
<br>
realize why you ought to maximize expected utility instead of running
<br>
out to save cute puppies.  So any Python developers with large blocks
<br>
of open-source development time may indeed consider this a formal
<br>
request for help.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky.
