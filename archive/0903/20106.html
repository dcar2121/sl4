Good point.  I've been choosing &quot;12.  All of your future light cone.&quot;  
<br>
implicitly, but it's good to make it explicit.  (Actually, I'd never 
<br>
figured out exactly what I was intuitively calling &quot;me&quot;, but 12 captures 
<br>
it rather nicely.  The only problem has to do with things like detached 
<br>
limbs, etc.  Once I lose a hand or arm or whatever, I no longer see it 
<br>
as part of &quot;me&quot;.  Probably if a prosthetic were attached I *would* soon 
<br>
see it as a part of &quot;me&quot;.  And clearly the atoms of my future body 
<br>
aren't necessarily currently within my light-cone, and the atoms that 
<br>
leave my body will no longer be a part of &quot;me&quot;.  So &quot;12.  All of your 
<br>
future light cone.&quot; is an over-inclusive statement.  Maybe
<br>
<p>&quot;13. All of my (current) future light cone that has the potential to 
<br>
remember being me.&quot;
<br>
<p>Even that's a bit vague.  I don't consider my corpse to be &quot;me&quot;.  &quot;Me&quot; 
<br>
is associated with physical continuity, plus connected memories.  And I 
<br>
guess I can't really give a satisfactory definition.  Would I consider 
<br>
someone who had my memories teleported into their mind via non-classical 
<br>
processes (i.e., outside my light-cone) to be me?  If I were that person 
<br>
I would, but I don't know what the original &quot;me&quot; would think.  And what 
<br>
if the person just ended up with a part of my memories?  Or what if 
<br>
there were merely the result of a random rearrangement?  In each case 
<br>
the person with the memories would consider themselves to be &quot;me&quot;, but I 
<br>
have my doubts as to whether the self who descended via classical 
<br>
processes would consider them so.
<br>
<p>OTOH, I see &quot;me&quot; as basically an artifact of memory.  When I remember 
<br>
myself at an earlier age, I don't doubt that it's me.  So, to an extent, 
<br>
the key feature is a connected chain of memories.  After a twinning 
<br>
process, at first the &quot;twin&quot; will be closer to &quot;me&quot; than anything 
<br>
besides me that I could ever conceive of.  And it will always be closer 
<br>
to me than a brother or sister.  (There is, of course, no guarantee that 
<br>
I'll like him.   At first talking would be a disaster.  But 
<br>
understanding would run VERY deep.)
<br>
<p>If some twinning process becomes feasible, we'll need to develop a 
<br>
vocabulary to allow one to express how close to &quot;me&quot; someone is.  But 
<br>
memories keep accumulating, so by the time that one is twice one's 
<br>
current age at time of twinning, there will be VERY significant 
<br>
differences.  But they'll be built on a deep foundation that's 
<br>
identical, which should make understanding much easier.
