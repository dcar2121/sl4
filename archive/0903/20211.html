<p>In a world where people can't be copied, it makes perfect sense to ask what you can expect to experience. In a world where people can be copied, you need to define what you mean by &quot;you&quot;. It comes down to how your brain calculates probabilities, and whether it is using an appropriate algorithm in this new world where probabilities don't have to add up to 1.
