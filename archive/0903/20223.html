<em>&gt; &gt; I understood Matt's original position that we would choose A (with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; caveat that there is no lasting inexplicable physical damage) because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness with no memory of the experience is indistinguishable from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; having not had the experience at all.  A memory of fading intensity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much more traumatic than no memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Removing the memory does not make the experience benign. If it did, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience would matter since we are all in the end demented or dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>granted.  But the point is about identity continuity around events or the
<br>
lack of memory of events.
<br>
<p>For all the upload and teleport philosophical devices, I don't think this is
<br>
much different than if I were to get you so stupidly drunk that you had no
<br>
recollection of events at last night's party.  If I told you that you did
<br>
XYZ heinous or embarrassing things, would you trust me and act accordingly?
<br>
What if I provided pictures?  What if those pictures were expertly
<br>
photoshopped?  Do you see how this might become a problem in a world where
<br>
memory is as easily constructed/manipulated as photoshopped images?
