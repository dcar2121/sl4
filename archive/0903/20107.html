<br>
<p><em>&gt;  My point is that ethical beliefs are not the same thing as the truth. 
</em><br>
<p>Right, so with a huge pile of irrational beliefs that every one of us
<br>
has why does your thought experiment hinge on whether a person would or
<br>
would not feel comfortable walking into a duplicating chamber? That will
<br>
tell us nothing about the truth. If you’re interested in the truth and
<br>
not in some superstitious belief an individual may have then your
<br>
thought experiments should be geared to determine if that individual
<br>
could even tell if he was a copy or The High Holy Original. He won’t be
<br>
uncomfortable if he can’t tell that anything happened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as if our minds had free will as opposed to being programs. 
</em><br>
<p>In other words, as if our minds acted at random as opposed to being
<br>
programs.
