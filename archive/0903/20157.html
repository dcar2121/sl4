<em>&gt; I my brain stops it cannot form new memories, so when it starts up again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe will appear to me to have suddenly jumped. There is no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can tell if my mind continued smoothly and the universe jumped or if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe proceeded smoothly and my mind stopped for a while.
</em><br>
<p>Of course there is! Use the standards you normally use. If before your
<br>
mind jumped, you were walking across the road, and after, you woke up
<br>
in a white bed, surrounded by your doctors and cheerfull loved ones,
<br>
and someone hugs you saying &quot;it's a miracle you woke up! you've been
<br>
in a coma for months!&quot;, while are the newspapers are talking about the
<br>
same things but with a date a few months in the future - then the
<br>
balance of evidence is that your mind stopped, and the universe
<br>
continued.
<br>
<p>But if you are perfectly awake the whole time and suddenly the
<br>
universe goes strange in completely off-the-wall ways - well, that's
<br>
evidence the universe has jumped in some way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the pure philosophical point of view, you are correct, but in
</em><br>
practice, there should be clues to enable you to distinguish the two
<br>
situations.
<br>
