<em>&gt;&gt; The irreducible randomness of the first person perspective does not

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everything relevant about the experiment: at 10 AM I will be
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; universe, assigning a probability of 1/2 to heads is due to partial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ignorance: I know how a series of past coin tosses have turned out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but I don't know how this particular one will turn out, for if I did I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would assign heads a probability of either 1 or 0. But in the former
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; example although I know exactly what is going to happen, I don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what I'm going to experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're asking the wrong question. One of you will experience heads and one will experience tails.
</em><br>
<p>You are dismissing the significance of the difference between
<br>
subjective, first person experience and objective, third person
<br>
description. You may as well argue that going to the cinema is a waste
<br>
of money since what's *really* projected on the screen is a series of
<br>
still frames.
