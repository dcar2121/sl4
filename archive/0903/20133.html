<p>I think this is one of the simplest statements of your position on this

<p>I was trying to figure out how to say exactly this in earlier threads.
<br>
&nbsp;Whether these jumps are measured in milliseconds or millennia, whatever
<br>
refresh rate is 'normal' will determine the kind of thinking one does within
<br>
this tolerance.

<p>I agree that pre- and post- coffee &quot;me&quot; are different personalities, but
<br>
both are within some deviation from the median identity (attractor?) that
<br>
various cognitive agents would recognize repeatedly over time.
