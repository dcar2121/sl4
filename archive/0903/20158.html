<br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for your concise summary. I accept both your points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sure then that it's already been asked what happens if two copies are created at the same time, in which one will I continue to experience?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world would say 'both', but I cannot experience being in two bodies at the same time.
</em><br>
<p>You have a 1/2 chance of ending up as one or the other. If 10 copies
<br>
are made and 9 of them are tortured, you have a 9/10 chance of finding
<br>
yourself one of the ones that is tortured. Some object to this saying
<br>
&quot;but you will actually be all the copies&quot;, but as you point out people
<br>
can only experience one stream of consciousness at a time. In the many
<br>
worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics it is postulated that we
<br>
are duplicated all the time, and the observed probabilities occur
<br>
because we only experience being one of the duplicates in one of the
<br>
universes.
