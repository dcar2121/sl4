<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lastly, there is the issue of impact upon the future of humanity. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is bad because the human mind (at least my mind) finds it hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cope with the immense cognitive dissonance that is created by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weight of responsibility, and the implication that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant chance that the human race will be wiped out by someone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uFAI project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. AGI won't be developed in isolation. It will be an internet that keeps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting smarter, and harder to know when you are talking to a human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Everyone, including criminals, will have access to AGI, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone has access to email and Google.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...unless someone can show me a model of self-improving intelligence in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; box rushing past the collective intelligence of humanity, I think the focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our attention should be the collective intelligence of humanity.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, I could respond &quot;unless you can show me a model of the internet acting
<br>
as an agent rather than a large repository of data, I think the focus should
<br>
be self-improving intelligence&quot;.
<br>
<p>But, I like to have an open mind. You are not the only one who has negated
<br>
the geographical locality assumption. Maybe you are correct.
<br>
<p>If you are correct, what should we do? Probably not much in particular;
<br>
simply look forward to a world that becomes more and more intelligent over
<br>
time. Perhaps one would recommend strengthening the democratic process and
<br>
the rigor of public policy debate.
<br>
