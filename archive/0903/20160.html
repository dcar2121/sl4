<p>No, you will believe that you have a 1/2 chance of ending up as one or the other. Probability is a mathematical model of belief, not of reality. You can program any number you want in the range [0,1] and that is what you will believe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics it is postulated
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur because we only experience being one of the duplicates in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the universes.
</em><br>
<p>Many-worlds is indistinguishable from the case that there is one universe in a definite quantum state, but you don't know what that state is.
