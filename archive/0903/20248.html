<em>&gt; Lastly, there is the issue of impact upon the future of humanity. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is bad because the human mind (at least my mind) finds it hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cope with the immense cognitive dissonance that is created by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight of responsibility, and the implication that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant chance that the human race will be wiped out by someone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uFAI project.
</em><br>
<p>1. AGI won't be developed in isolation. It will be an internet that keeps getting smarter, and harder to know when you are talking to a human.
<br>
<p>2. Everyone, including criminals, will have access to AGI, just like everyone has access to email and Google.
<br>
<p>...unless someone can show me a model of self-improving intelligence in a box rushing past the collective intelligence of humanity, I think the focus of our attention should be the collective intelligence of humanity.
