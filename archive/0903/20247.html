<em>&gt;&gt; I'm still not certain, but I think that AI/AGI research is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fulfilling thing for me to do with the next 6 years of my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Lastly, there is the issue of impact upon the future of humanity. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It is bad because the human mind (at least my mind) finds it hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cope with the immense cognitive dissonance that is created by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; weight of responsibility, and the implication that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; significant chance that the human race will be wiped out by someone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; uFAI project. Also, merely contemplating the size of the stakes (both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the reward for success, and the penalty for failure) makes you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that you are insane.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've spent the last few years mostly doing things entirely unrelated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with AGI research.  In my experience, once you're aware of the issues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll pay the costs listed above whether you do constructive work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the issues or not.  So they aren't really costs of working on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues unless the alternative is to completely fill your attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with meaningless distractions so you don't think about what's really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening.  Apparently I'm not up to that.  I just can't party hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough.
</em><br>
<p>Haha... I'll have to invite you to one of my parties up here in  
<br>
Edinburgh ...
<br>
<p>In all seriousness, yes I agree. There is a strong moral imperative  
<br>
here that no intelligent non-psychopath can ignore. It's tough to turn  
<br>
that overwhelming imperative into a motivation which doesn't send you  
<br>
crazy, though.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I think you're doing the right thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me know if you figure out how to get paid.
