2009/3/5 Matt Mahoney &lt;<a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Uploads%20coming%20first%20would%20be%20good,%20right?">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; In the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics it is postulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that we are duplicated all the time, and the observed probabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; occur because we only experience being one of the duplicates in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; one of the universes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many-worlds is indistinguishable from the case that there is one universe in a definite quantum state, but you don't know what that state is.
</em><br>
<p>That's the point: your subjective expectation of seeing heads when you
<br>
are duplicated and the two copies see opposite sides of the coin
<br>
should be the same as your subjective possibility of seeing heads when
<br>
you toss a coin in ordinary life. You can point out that &quot;subjective
<br>
probability&quot; has no real objective basis in either case, but that's
<br>
why it's called subjective.
