<p>Um, you may have misunderstood. &quot;All of your future light cone&quot;
<br>
includes things like the sound of your footsteps, photons from your
<br>
body heat warming a tree you happen to be passing, the butterfly that
<br>
was sitting on the tree, the butterfly deciding the tree is too warm
<br>
and taking off, and the tornado six months hence caused by the
<br>
butterfly's takeoff. It's a pretty radical notion of personal
<br>
identity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;13. All of my (current) future light cone that has the potential to

</em><br>
<p>Interesting. An alien (or computer program) that maliciously killed
<br>
you and then scanned your brain into its form of episodic memory might
<br>
remember being you.
<br>
Would you call that entity &quot;me&quot;, even if it has very different goals
<br>
and emotions from the present you?
