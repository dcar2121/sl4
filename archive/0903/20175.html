<p><em>&gt; With no experience of a coin toss, you can't even assume the outcome is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads or tails - it could disappear via slight of hand, it could turn into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dozen pigeons,  it could explode.  Your first observation of a coin toss may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely be so fascinating that you marvel at the trajectory of the object and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sound of its impact - ignoring the orientation of it faces.  If we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing robots easily capable of reproducing the &quot;flip&quot; action, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result may always be heads due to a carefully controlled application of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forces.  Would this observation that the particular flip action results with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100% reproducible outcome indicate anything fundamental about probability?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this a completely deterministic cosmology? Oh, so the &quot;flip&quot; needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more 'random' - so where does this randomness come from?  It gets computed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By what mechanism?  I propose angels/demons vie for control of the coin's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yin/yang energies and stuff happens below the threshold of observation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eventually the result becomes known.  Simple as that.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly, the MWI of QM and duplication thought experiments in
<br>
general allow for true randomness in the setting of absolute
<br>
determinism. If you are duplicated so that one copy sees heads while
<br>
the other sees tails, then the objective fact of the matter is that
<br>
one copy sees heads and the other copy sees tails, each with a
<br>
probability of 1. But from the first person perspective of the
<br>
experimental subject, who can only experience one thing at a time,
<br>
there is a probability of 1/2 that he will experience heads or tails.
<br>
The same applies to an observer watching an event like radioactive
<br>
decay under MWI: which world he will find himself in, and hence which
<br>
outcome he will see, is completely random, even though the physics of
<br>
the multiverse as a whole is completely deterministic. Thus, quantum
<br>
randomness is explained without resorting to the fundamental
<br>
randomness of collapse interpretations.
