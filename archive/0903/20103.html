</em><br>
<p>In an attempt to take this conversation in a different direction than
<br>
we have gone in before, let us talk about entities. Each entity in
<br>
this list has a claim to be you, but there are other reasons to say
<br>
that the entity is not you. You could add additional features to each
<br>
of these scenarios to transform them into a continuum between
<br>
more-plausibly-you and less-plausibly you.
<br>
<p>Note: This list is in no particular order.
<br>
1. Your tomorrow self after going to sleep tonight (&quot;sleep is death&quot;).
<br>
2. Your self after surgery on your heart that requires stopping your
<br>
heart (&quot;death&quot;).
<br>
3. Your self after many of the atoms in your body have been replaced,
<br>
via normal living.
<br>
4. Your self after a radical atom-flushing treatment replaces all of
<br>
the atoms in your body.
<br>
5. Your self after a stroke that causes you to change in knowledge or emotions.
<br>
6. Your clone, grown from your DNA.
<br>
7. Your self after a genome-editing virus transforms you into
<br>
(technically) a different species - mutually infertile with unedited
<br>
humans, but otherwise identical.
<br>
8. Your life's work, a body of text that might be republished and
<br>
reread by college students for centuries.
<br>
9. Your children.
<br>
10. A high-quality simulation of you.
<br>
11. Your self after surgery on your brain to change your personality.
<br>
12. All of your future light cone.
<br>
<p>My point is that we ACTIVELY DECIDE which future entities fit into our
<br>
utility functions in the role of &quot;my future self&quot;. There isn't a
<br>
bright line labeled &quot;self&quot; in the world - it's all atoms underneath.
<br>
