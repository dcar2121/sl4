<br>
<p><em>&gt; And you will have even less memory of it if you are not the survivor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forget teleportation, if you walk into a torture chamber you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember none of the subsequent events after they’ve finished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disemboweling you. Nevertheless I’d prefer not to walk into that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chamber; but that’s just me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there’s no arguing over matters of taste.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A good thought experiment should examine an idea of illustrate a point;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can’t see how this torture the original and pamper the copy business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or the other way around) can do either.
</em><br>
<p>At the point of teleportation you have a 1/2 chance of experiencing,
<br>
say, either 5 minutes of torture and then dying or life carrying on as
<br>
usual at your desired destination. I would say that was a bad deal,
<br>
unless you were going to be killed or tortured anyway if you didn't
<br>
teleport this way. On the other hand, if the teleporter instantly
<br>
killed the original (basically what destructive teleportation is
<br>
supposed to be) there would be no problem.
