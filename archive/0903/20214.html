The human brain computes probability based on a model that assumes that memories accurately reflect the past and that the past predicts the future. Suppose you are given a choice of (A) being tortured, and then having the memory of the torture erased, or (B) not being tortured, but then having a false memory of torture programmed into your brain. Our model says that after many trials you will consistently choose (A) even if you prefer not to be tortured.
