<p><em>&gt; I understood Matt's original position that we would choose A (with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caveat that there is no lasting inexplicable physical damage) because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness with no memory of the experience is indistinguishable from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having not had the experience at all.Â  A memory of fading intensity is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more traumatic than no memory.
</em><br>
<p>Removing the memory does not make the experience benign. If it did, no
<br>
experience would matter since we are all in the end demented or dead.
