<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without a definition how will you know if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have what you were after? 
</em><br>
<p>By seeing if the thing that I just made is like that thing over there
<br>
that I am very interested in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if you don't have a decent workable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition you might as well be working at random. 
</em><br>
<p>When you really get down to it, definitions are Bullshit. Every single
<br>
definition in the dictionary is made of words, and every one of those
<br>
words have their own definitions made of yet more words that are also in
<br>
the dictionary, and on and an it goes. The only thing that saves us from
<br>
this hideous infinite loop is examples, at some point we can say to hell
<br>
with the dictionary and point to a ASCII sequence and then to something
<br>
in the real world and say “this means that”.
<br>
<p>And by the way, I maintain that it is imposable to define “define”
<br>
without sounding stupid.
