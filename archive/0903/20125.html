<p><em>&gt; Subjectively you have a 1/2 chance of suffering when faced

</em><br>
<p>I think the reason people are getting so confused over this is not that
<br>
they come up with the wrong answer, the problem is that they come up
<br>
with the wrong question. The correct question is “What is the
<br>
probability that after I step into that teleportation booth I will
<br>
conclude that I am being tortured?” The answer of course is 100%. If the
<br>
question was “What is the probability that I will NOT be tortured the
<br>
answer would also be 100%. 
<br>
<p>And the answers would be exactly the same if the one who was painfully
<br>
killed was the copy not The High Holy Original.
