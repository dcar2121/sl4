<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with you and I think that the good side surpasses a lot the bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, it's a weighty matter. Doing AGI/FAI research is undoubtedly a risk to
<br>
your scientific career. If you like a quiet life... then it probably isn't
<br>
worth it. If, like me, you have always been an iconoclast, and always wanted
<br>
to question things, to find out what is really important in science, then it
<br>
is the perfect challenge!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also want to do research in AI/AGI with a strong brain science basis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore I believe that one of the best options in this moment of my career
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to enter in a doctoral program about neuroinformatics and computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscience (like the one in Edinburgh). With this background I will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prepared to perform research about neuroscience and artificial intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in projects that attempt to create true intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure, you could do this. My opinion is that learning neuroscience is a waste
<br>
of your time. You'd be better off to learn the functional input output
<br>
behavior of the human brain (this is *cognitive science*) than learning
<br>
about the internal wiring. Read Minsky's emotion machine to find out about
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>Another great resource is Josh Tenebaum on hierarchical Bayesian models for
<br>
structure learning, which he relates to the learning behavior of infants.
<br>
Again, this is cognitive science, not neuroscience.
<br>
<p>A third source of inspiration is Ben Goertzel's general theory of general
<br>
AI, and Shane and Marcus' agent/environment interaction framework.
<br>
<p>Others will probably disagree with me...
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; You said that you will do research in AI/AGI, but more specifically where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and about what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm still not certain, but I think that AI/AGI research is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fulfilling thing for me to do with the next 6 years of my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Do remember that AGI research is a very hard scientific problem. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; both a good thing and a bad thing: it is good because it is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; interesting opponent to fight against; even if you fail, you will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;lived&quot; more than if you'd succeeded at some boring, run of the mill piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of almost-settled-science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It is a bad thing because you will fail a lot, and this will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; disheartening. Also, it has a poor intellectual reputation at the moment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; though this is improving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Lastly, there is the issue of impact upon the future of humanity. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; again is a double-edged sword. It is good because you get to feel you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; doing something really important, and if you are part of an effort that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; succeeds in creating a positive singularity, not only will you live forever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in a very nice world, but you will also be a hero for the rest of the age of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the universe, a kind of eternal celebrity. It is bad because the human mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (at least my mind) finds it hard to cope with the immense cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dissonance that is created by this weight of responsibility, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; implication that there is a significant chance that the human race will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wiped out by someone's uFAI project. Also, merely contemplating the size of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the stakes (both the reward for success, and the penalty for failure) makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you think that you are insane. I have found existentialist philosophy to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; helpful in this respect: humans must strive to create meaning in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; meaningless universe, and pursuing a mad-sounding but potentially universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; saving idea *does* creating meaning, even if the idea really is mad.
