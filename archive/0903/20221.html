<em>&gt; I understood Matt's original position that we would choose A (with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caveat that there is no lasting inexplicable physical damage) because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness with no memory of the experience is indistinguishable from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having not had the experience at all.  A memory of fading intensity is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more traumatic than no memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it is important to approach this scenario without emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment in the actual torture experience.  We should discuss only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states Matt proposed:  Tortured with no memory (and I added no evidence) vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No torture and vividly detailed memory of torture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Along the same line of thought as the crush-your-clone teleporter:  Having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been told that you are in the group that has received implanted memory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torture, you may rid yourself of by actually experiencing the torture you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already remember (perhaps the memory erasure drugs require this) - Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willingly retain your false memory or voluntarily accept torture as the cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of relief from those memories?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now this is a dangerous path. Don't substitute the reality with a map,
<br>
don't wirehead yourself into thinking that it's sufficient to believe
<br>
a lie to it become equivalent to the truth. If you care about
<br>
experience of torture, or about torture itself, you should act against
<br>
them, not against their symptoms.
<br>
<p>What if you create a simulation in which you torture and murder 10^100
<br>
people? Does it become OK if you erase all the evidence?
