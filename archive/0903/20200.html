<p><em>&gt; I would guess that conscioussness has an adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage over entities which are equivalently intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not conscious, inasmuch as consciousness is bound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with planning and simulating actions. 
</em><br>
<p>To say that one being can make plans and create mental simulations of
<br>
future events and one can not but the two beings are equally inelegant
<br>
is gibberish; such things are the hallmark of intelligence. At any rate
<br>
from your above comment I take it you would agree that if a computer can
<br>
out plan us, that is to say if it can beat the pants off us in any
<br>
mental task you care to name then you would conclude that it must be
<br>
conscious as hell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The argument that something can't exist because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution didn't produce it falls flat 
</em><br>
<p>Well I didn’t quite say that, but it does prove that if Darwin was right
<br>
then Evolution must see consciousness or consciousness is the byproduct
<br>
of intelligence, either way it means the Turing Test must work for
<br>
consciousness and not just inelegance. And you’re right, it’s not a
<br>
absolute proof that a unconscious intelligence is imposable, but it is
<br>
strong evidence in that direction, and at the very least it must mean
<br>
that a unconscious AI would be HARDER to make than a conscious one. So
<br>
guess what the first AI will be. And the first AI is the most important
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>If consciousness is the result of something like the notorious “self
<br>
circuit” that doesn’t effect behavior and just gives us a sense of self
<br>
and nothing more then Evolution could never have produced it and Darwin
<br>
was wrong. The day that the self circuit is proven to exist I will
<br>
become a Bible thumper myself. Don’t hold your breath
