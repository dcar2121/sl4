<p><em>&gt;&gt; Removing the memory does not make the experience benign. If it did, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experience would matter since we are all in the end demented or dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; granted.  But the point is about identity continuity around events or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack of memory of events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For all the upload and teleport philosophical devices, I don't think this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much different than if I were to get you so stupidly drunk that you had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recollection of events at last night's party.  If I told you that you did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; XYZ heinous or embarrassing things, would you trust me and act accordingly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if I provided pictures?  What if those pictures were expertly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; photoshopped?  Do you see how this might become a problem in a world where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory is as easily constructed/manipulated as photoshopped images?
</em><br>
<p>I suppose I would make a decision based on the evidence I have.
<br>
Personal identity, consciousness, even probability are - if it needs
<br>
to be spelt out - inherently subjective. The philosophical discussions
<br>
are not about what actually happens in the world, since that is either
<br>
a given from the premises or trivially obvious, but about what sort of
<br>
illusion or subjective experience we will have.
