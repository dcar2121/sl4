<p>Meta: Could we perhaps use the actual subject of the discussion
<br>
(destructive uploading as an alternative to death of old age), rather
<br>
than the teleporter booth metaphor? I think it is no longer adding to
<br>
intuition.
<br>
<p>We agree, some people would be willing to be uploaded, and some people
<br>
would not be willing. We also agree that neither side is likely to
<br>
convince the other that their views are correct without appealing to
<br>
emotion. But inside a discussion which is about the group's utility
<br>
function, emotions are relevant.
<br>
<p>The group's utility function is related, though not identical, to all
<br>
of the individual's utility functions. As I understand it, we are
<br>
discussing which emotions are socially appropriate to feel at a novel
<br>
situation - uploading someone in order to &quot;prevent&quot; them from dying.
<br>
Should we feel grief, because this is analogous to the familiar
<br>
situation of the person dying? Should we feel joy, because this is
<br>
analogous to familiar situation of the person being rescued by
<br>
medicine?
