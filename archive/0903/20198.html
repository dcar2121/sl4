<em>&gt; Well of course consciousness isn?t the same as intelligence! You can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have consciousness without intelligence but not intelligence without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>I would reverse that.  Being intelligent enough to know you're conscious
<br>
is a prerequisite for consciousness itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A human-equivalent intelligence with no goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wouldn't reproduce very effectively in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ancestral environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?s that got to do with the price of eggs? A Do Loop in a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program has a goal.  If you want to get to the heart of the matter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question you have to ask is ?Can Evolution see consciousness or can it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not??.  If it can then the Turing Test works for consciousness and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just intelligence and we can know for certain if a computer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious.  
</em><br>
<p>If by &quot;see&quot; you mean &quot;develop&quot;, I'd say that we're obvious example
<br>
proofs.  I would guess that conscioussness has an adaptive advantage
<br>
over entities which are equivalently intelligent but not conscious,
<br>
inasmuch as consciousness is bound up with planning and simulating
<br>
actions.  But it's all a guess, and I'll have to wait until it's all
<br>
better understood.
<br>
<p>The argument that something can't exist because evolution didn't 
<br>
produce it falls flat, though, when you consider wheels, aircraft
<br>
bodies, and calculators.  Evolution works with what exists already,
<br>
rather than with what could exist.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 1) Consciousness is an inevitable byproduct of intelligence, that is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say consciousness is just the way information feels like when it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being processed.
</em><br>
<p>It's almost as if you *want* it to be all mysterious and spiritual. :)
