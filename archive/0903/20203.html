In quantum mechanics, the square of the modulus of the wave function fits our model of probability only in the absence of other knowledge.

As another example, the probability of observing a radioactive decay over one half-life interval is 1/2 only if that interval is in the future. But if you knew the quantum state of the universe, you would know everything about the future and probability would be a meaningless concept.

I can remember that you have claimed that &quot;probability is a model of 
<br>
belief, not of reality &quot;, but that won't convince me that you have 
<br>
asserted a true statement.  And if I am understanding the model of the 
<br>
Many-Worlds hypothesis that you are expounding, I'm not sure that it's 
<br>
the standard version.  The one that I prefer goes like this:
<br>
&quot;The state vector does not collapse.  What you are interpreting as the 
<br>
collapse of the state vector is the bifurcation of the wave state into 
<br>
discrete 'segments'.&quot;
<br>
<p>In other words, both events happen with a probability density, and the 
<br>
wave state of the universe maintains consistency by preventing differing 
<br>
histories from re-encountering each other.  This can be modeled as the 
<br>
universe splitting, i.e. as numerous little tiny ping-pong balls 
<br>
suddenly duplicating and moveing at right angles to everything else so 
<br>
that a branch of the universe is created, but that's just a mental 
<br>
model.  All that really happens is that the state vector doesn't 
<br>
collapse.  You don't receive A measurement, you receive a vector of 
<br>
measurements, but each you only responds to one of the measurement 
<br>
elements.  AhhhhGG!  That's lousy!  I'm paraphrasing someone else's 
<br>
explanation of their understanding of the math, and not being very 
<br>
successful, but the essence is that the state vector doesn't collapse, 
<br>
and the universe has a lot more dimensions than you can imagine.
