<p>No, because uploading is the same issue with the extra complication that the copy is not exactly like the original. (Its brain is in silicon. It has a robotic body, or no body, etc). I could phrase the same question in this context. If there is a program running that imitates you so well that nobody can distinguish it from you, then are you willing to die and give control of your estate to this program?
