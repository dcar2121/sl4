<em>&gt; Yes, that is my example exactly! Abstract philosophical discussions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the one that we are having right now, can change culture (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group's utility function), and via culture, emotions (the individual's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility function).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Note that utility function is something you don't want to &quot;change&quot;. To
<br>
be more precise, by changing utility function I mean a process that
<br>
results in future being optimized for different criteria than was
<br>
desired (in decision-theoretical sense) by agent in the past. You may
<br>
want to learn to recognize as desirable those patterns that lead to
<br>
what you want, thus changing their instrumental utility in your eyes,
<br>
but you don't want to actually change the utility function seen in
<br>
decision-makers (unless you come to a point where you start
<br>
utility-optimizing the optimization algorithm itself).
<br>
<p>Of course, real cultural changes may be considered as changing utility
<br>
function, where you can't fine-tune the changes, so if you had that
<br>
power, you would be bound to choose from the available attractors
<br>
where the culture stabilizes after culture-changing decision is made.
