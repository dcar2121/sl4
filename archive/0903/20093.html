<p><em>&gt; The teleportation industry might go to great lengths

<br>
I’ve heard debates on this subject for a long time and the evolution of
<br>
my opponent’s argument is always the same. First he proposes a though
<br>
experiment with you and a exact copy of you (for some reason that I
<br>
don’t understand in their examples you are always the original, never
<br>
the copy). After assuring us over and over that they are exact in every
<br>
particular he then proceeds to slowly tortures to death one of them but
<br>
NOT the other, he then turns to me with a glint of triumph in his eye
<br>
and says “see, you wouldn’t like that very much if this was real I’ll
<br>
bet”. 
<br>
<p>They seem to think it’s obvious that they have just proven something
<br>
profound; but I’ll be damned if I can figure out what it is. Yes it is
<br>
true that being tortured will change you, but that’s not very profound,
<br>
I already knew that. No, their big point must be something else, but I
<br>
don’t have a clue of what it could be.
