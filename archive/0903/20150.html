<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the reason people are getting so confused over this is not that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they come up with the wrong answer, the problem is that they come up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the wrong question. The correct question is “What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability that after I step into that teleportation booth I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that I am being tortured?” The answer of course is 100%. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question was “What is the probability that I will NOT be tortured the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer would also be 100%.
</em><br>
<p>You do have a point in that you are describing the objective truth,
<br>
but the objective truth is still compatible with a probabilistic
<br>
subjective interpretation. A quantum coin toss under the many worlds
<br>
interpretation of quantum mechanics still results in a 1/2 chance of
<br>
the observer seeing heads or tails, and you have assumed this your
<br>
whole life whether you believe in MWI or CI.
