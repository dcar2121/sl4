<em>&gt; Anyone who believes that consciousness (that which makes you not a P-zombie) exists believes that there are some things which are not conscious. I can always construct a continuum between these cases. For example, if a newly fertilized egg is not conscious, what about a 3 month old embryo? If an ant is not conscious, what about a dog? If a program that prints &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; is not conscious, what about a program that also passes the Turing test? By a process of binary search, I can always force you to draw the line through some absurdly small region.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only other alternatives are to claim that either everything is conscious or that nothing is conscious. In either case, the term is meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I can do the same for questions about identity.
</em><br>
<p>Consciousness need not be a binary quantity. Same goes for identity.
<br>
And consciousness need not have anything to do with zombies - I
<br>
believe that consciousness exists, and that Zombies are impossible.
