<p>It has nothing to do with math. You believe you are conscious for the same reason that spiders know how to weave webs.
<br>
<p>I believe that my consciousness does not exist because every logical argument about it always leads to this conclusion. I also believe that my consciousness does exist, because I can't believe otherwise, because anyone who could believe otherwise saw no reason to live and therefore did not pass on their DNA for me to inherit. I realize these two positions are inconsistent. I prefer to have this inconsistency out in the open rather than tangled up in complex arguments about AI, identity, uploading, teleportation, copying, etc.
<br>
<p>If you don't accept the inconsistency, then you will keep looking for flaws in the arguments. That's why these threads never die...
