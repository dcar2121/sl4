What I mean is, atoms are constantly leaving and joining my body... if I cut off my left piny finger and then use nanotech or gene therapy to grow it back then am I the same person afterwards?  Of course.  So say take position A... The first quadrant of a square room... take position B... The second quadrant of a square room.... say I am at position A and I am instantly destroyed while at the EXACT same time in position B I am recreated.  Is that the same as me walking from position A to position B?

<p><p><p>It boils down to identity...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What is the difference between say a programmable silicon or carbon nanotube neuron versus an organic neuron?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We are obviously a pattern of information that is created by a physical process...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So is the pattern the only thing that matters or is it both the pattern and the physical substrate?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If the substrate is different but the pattern is the same then does it matter?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If at instance x I copy of me is created while at the same time I am destroyed then does my consciousness continue?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Obviously if a copy of me is created and I can go up and pat him on the head then there are two of us no?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We are seperate physical processes running the same pattern (therefore there are two of us), but if two physical processes are replaced at the exact instance x then does it matter?

<em>&gt; No, because uploading is the same issue with the extra complication that the copy is not exactly like the original. (Its brain is in silicon. It has a robotic body, or no body, etc). I could phrase the same question in this context. If there is a program running that imitates you so well that nobody can distinguish it from you, then are you willing to die and give control of your estate to this program?
