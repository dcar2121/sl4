2009/3/8 Matt Mahoney &lt;<a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Many-worlds%20(was%20Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Uploads%20coming%20first%20would%20be%20%20good,%20right?)">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You are dismissing the significance of the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; subjective, first person experience and objective, third person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; description. You may as well argue that going to the cinema is a waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of money since what's *really* projected on the screen is a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; still frames.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a world where people can't be copied, it makes perfect sense to ask what you can expect to experience. In a world where people can be copied, you need to define what you mean by &quot;you&quot;. It comes down to how your brain calculates probabilities, and whether it is using an appropriate algorithm in this new world where probabilities don't have to add up to 1.
</em><br>
<p>Apparent paradoxes of probability can also occur in a single world
<br>
where there is no copying, for example the Sleeping Beauty Problem
<br>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_beauty_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_beauty_problem</a>). The
<br>
fundamental issue here is that there is no objective theory of
<br>
personal identity to which we can refer. The only &quot;theory&quot; of personal
<br>
identity that gives an unequivocal answer and eliminates paradoxes is
<br>
that there is no persistent identity at all: each observer moment is a
<br>
separate entity, and the feeling of continuity is an illusion. But
<br>
like watching a film, it is meaningful to ask what sort of illusion I
<br>
am going to experience under particular circumstances.
