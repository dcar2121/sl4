<p>It seems that Everett did not imagine splitting universes. Rather, he includes the observer in the quantum equation, so that making an observation (an event that is asymmetric with regard to time) has no special status in a physics that is otherwise symmetric with regard to time. It seems illogical to me the need to reintroduce a probabilistic interpretation in terms of splitting universes after we have just eliminated the fundamental role of probability in physics. I agree with Einstein. Many-worlds (not Everett's term) is indistinguishable from the case of a single universe with a definite quantum state that is not known to the observers within that universe (as if it could be known).
