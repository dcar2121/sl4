<p><em>&gt; Not ok. This Dennet, Blckmore take on consciousness is
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact the statement that conciousness does not add

</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps the following will aid in understanding. If I hard wired your brain to connect the &quot;2+2&quot; neurons to your &quot;5&quot; neurons, you would not ask &quot;what is 2+2?&quot; You would ask &quot;why does 2+2=5?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A super inteligent, but not conscious, AI recieves an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload. The company that owns the AI demos the newly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded person to it's family. It passes all sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tests - Turing style and White box - the audience concluded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this really is uncle Bert. It does not have a body, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not a zombie, it is a set of responses that has fooled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the room. It may require 10x the processing power of a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain to run. In this example consciousness is a performance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization allowing complex behaviour to run on smaller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware/wetware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uncle Bert is not conscious - this is not irrelevant for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people considering the procedure.
</em><br>
<p>So lets say that the upload service figures out an optimization that allows Bert to be simulated and pass all the tests as before with 1/10 the computing power. Does that make it conscious? Or are you saying that's impossible because currently the brain does 10% of your thinking and your consciousness (by some mysterious process) does the other 90%?
<br>
<p>Or is it possible that 2+2=4?
