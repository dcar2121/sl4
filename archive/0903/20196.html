<p><em>&gt; I consider an expert system to be intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in a narrow way), but not conscious. 
</em><br>
<p>I’ll bet you don’t think that program is very conscious because it’s not
<br>
very intelligent, but I don’t understand why everybody assumes that
<br>
coming up with intelligence is easy but consciousness is hard. The parts
<br>
of the brain that produce emotion (and presumably you think emotion has
<br>
something to do with consciousness) are hundreds of millions of years
<br>
old, but the parts of the brain that produce the sort of intelligence we
<br>
are so proud of are only about one million years old.
<br>
<p>So if evolution found it easier to come up with consciousness than
<br>
intelligence I don't see why we would find the opposite to be true; you
<br>
could make a stronger case saying a computer may be conscious
<br>
someday but it will never be intelligent; although I think it will be
<br>
both. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't have an explicit, acceptable, and usable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of either intelligence or consciousness. 
</em><br>
<p>That’s OK, except for pure mathematics precise definitions are of little
<br>
use when you have something far more important, examples. Most people
<br>
can lead a full rich rewarding life having never looked at a dictionary
<br>
since their teacher made them do so when they were twelve; and after
<br>
all, examples are where lexographers got the information to write their
<br>
book.
