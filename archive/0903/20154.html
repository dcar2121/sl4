2009/3/4  &lt;<a href="mailto:rick.smith@ntlworld.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20Uploads%20coming%20first%20would%20be%20good,%20right?">rick.smith@ntlworld.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<em>&gt; Please excuse me if this has been done to death,
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it has been repeatedly discussed on this and many other
<br>
lists, and although some never tire of this important topic others get
<br>
annoyed and might even demand the thread be terminated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I think focusing on the question of whether there is a thing called a consciousness clouds the issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the question is about a continuity of experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the rest of the world there's no difference, but how could somebody make me believe that my experience would not just cease as I am physically destroyed?
</em><br>
<p>Your experience would cease, but it would kick in again when your copy
<br>
is fired up. This is what happens when you walk from A to B: you
<br>
disappear from the universe at A, and some time later your copy
<br>
appears at B and has much the same experiences as the original at A.
<br>
<p>Objection: walking retains the same matter.
<br>
Response: metabolic processes replace most of the matter in your body
<br>
over months, and you still feel that you're the same person.
<br>
<p>Objection: there is continuity of consciousness in the intermediate
<br>
stages as you walk from A to B.
<br>
Response: not if you are anaesthetised and carried.
