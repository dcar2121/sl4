<em>&gt; Before you toss the coin what should your expectation of tails be?

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

Why do you think you should have an expectation at all?  By the time we
<br>
raise this coin toss to the abstraction where cosmology has any relevance to
<br>
the outcome, I wonder if we should also call into question  a priori
<br>
knowledge of coin toss or observation memory or every/any damned thing.
<br>
<p>With no experience of a coin toss, you can't even assume the outcome is only
<br>
heads or tails - it could disappear via slight of hand, it could turn into a
<br>
dozen pigeons,  it could explode.  Your first observation of a coin toss may
<br>
likely be so fascinating that you marvel at the trajectory of the object and
<br>
the sound of its impact - ignoring the orientation of it faces.  If we're
<br>
discussing robots easily capable of reproducing the &quot;flip&quot; action, the
<br>
result may always be heads due to a carefully controlled application of
<br>
forces.  Would this observation that the particular flip action results with
<br>
100% reproducible outcome indicate anything fundamental about probability?
<br>
Is this a completely deterministic cosmology? Oh, so the &quot;flip&quot; needs to be
<br>
more 'random' - so where does this randomness come from?  It gets computed?
<br>
By what mechanism?  I propose angels/demons vie for control of the coin's
<br>
yin/yang energies and stuff happens below the threshold of observation and
<br>
eventually the result becomes known.  Simple as that.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I've read too many &quot;coin flip&quot; threads.  Seems there is a
<br>
correlation between this and the wax and wane of personal identity
<br>
threads...
