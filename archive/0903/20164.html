I guess what I am trying to say is several things...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>A)  I am conscious and that I am self-aware and thus know I am conscious, so it is my own personal gamble to upload and yes if I lose consciousness then you wont know the difference, but I believe if I die any copy of me WOULD be concious.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>B)  Consciousness is physical and is created once a certain amount of information and feedback within the brain is achieved, but that still doesn't say exactly what consciousness is.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>C)  The questions of consciousness and identity need to be solved in order for us to know if I will continue my consciousness in teleportion, uploading, etc.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>D)  Aren't animals like dogs, cats, mice, chimps, etc. conscious because they have visual, auditory, etc. cortices but are not self-aware?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>E)  Is some form of advanced cognition needed (i.e. abstract reasoning and language) needed for self-awareness?  Or at least the systems that create those advanced capacities need to be present.
<br>
