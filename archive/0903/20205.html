Without a definition how will you know if you have what you were after?
<br>
I won't deny that examples are EXTREMELY useful.  But if you don't have 
<br>
a decent workable definition you might as well be working at random.
<br>
<p>Now I'll admit that one can do a lot with implicit definitions.  But 
<br>
they can also be quite difficult to use.
