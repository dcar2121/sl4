That's rather hasty...
<br>
<p>There seems to be somewhat less activity on the whole in the stock 
<br>
market than exists in a brain, but to say that it's less ordered is 
<br>
rather hasty:
<br>
- It is built entirely upon the activities of human conscious 
<br>
entities... these can be modeled as (on average) obeying broad rules of 
<br>
action, as neurons are
<br>
- There are trends that can be traced and characterized throughout the 
<br>
patterns of activity (of stock trades rather than synaptic interaction), 
<br>
as again in the brain
<br>
- The stock market can be thought of as a control point for the economy 
<br>
as a whole, with all the inputs and outputs that implies (brain?)
<br>
<p>No, it is not the same. It certainly seems somewhat smaller. I would 
<br>
defend neither its wisdom nor its ability to self-regulate on these grounds.
<br>
<p>But it certainly involves feedback mechanisms that work through time, 
<br>
and therefore it can be characterized as maintaining a layer of 
<br>
consciousness atop that of the physical universe alone.
<br>
<p><p>I do, of course, question any approach that might trivialize its 
<br>
structure into that of a straightforward neural network -- I don't think 
<br>
that's a very accurate representation, and it attempts to fit it too 
<br>
violently toward the human-brain-model rather than stretching our ideas 
<br>
of the kinds of systems that can support valuable consciousness. 
<br>
Specifically, it seems extremely relevant to me that each individual 
<br>
element of the substrate can access any of the information in the system 
<br>
at any time. This de-emphasizes the social closeness that might 
<br>
otherwise parallel the physical arrangement of neurons. It increases 
<br>
instability of the system as a whole, especially considering the 
<br>
looseness of rule structures that individuals use relative to neurons. 
<br>
The consciousness of the stock market is also, perhaps relevantly, using 
<br>
much less direct mechanisms of control on the 'body' economic at whose 
<br>
head it ostensibly sits.
<br>
<p>To either discount its complexity or its organization is unproductive, 
<br>
without some justification... It's disorganized in a lot of ways, sure; 
<br>
so is the brain. I ask you: why is it a fundamentally different kind of 
<br>
system?
