<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, that is my example exactly! Abstract philosophical discussions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such as the one that we are having right now, can change culture (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; group's utility function), and via culture, emotions (the individual's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; utility function).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that utility function is something you don't want to &quot;change&quot;. To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more precise, by changing utility function I mean a process that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results in future being optimized for different criteria than was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desired (in decision-theoretical sense) by agent in the past. You may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to learn to recognize as desirable those patterns that lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you want, thus changing their instrumental utility in your eyes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you don't want to actually change the utility function seen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision-makers (unless you come to a point where you start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utility-optimizing the optimization algorithm itself).
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, maybe I was using the &quot;utility function&quot; wrongly.
<br>
<p>If we have a reified procedure, a computing device, that we were using
<br>
as the &quot;group utility function calculator&quot;, and when fed with novel
<br>
parameters, it started producing &quot;NaN&quot; or &quot;sqrt(-1)&quot; or other evidence
<br>
of breakdown, then we would want to build a new calculator. We would
<br>
go back to first principles (individual preferences) and negotiate a
<br>
new social norm for the novel situation, and incorporate the new
<br>
social norm into the repaired calculator.
<br>
<p>To un-metaphorize: Our current social norms (&quot;utility&quot;) are computed
<br>
by some fuzzy mental process, probably consisting of comparing
<br>
situations to clear ethical exemplars (murder, fraud, rescuing someone
<br>
from death, et cetera). Usually, we have pretty good agreement between
<br>
individuals, at least to the point of &quot;definitely praise-worthy&quot;,
<br>
&quot;definitely reprimand-worthy&quot;, or &quot;murky&quot;.
<br>
<p>About some topics, abortion and uploading being two of them, we seem
<br>
to get wildly divergent estimates for what the social norm is. I think
<br>
using valuative (&quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;) and normative (&quot;should&quot;) language to
<br>
talk about those issues and strive to come to some agreement is
<br>
rational.
