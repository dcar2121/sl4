<em>&gt; Um, you may have misunderstood. &quot;All of your future light cone&quot;

Yeah, I misunderstood.  My meaning is based around episodic continuity 
<br>
of consciousness and memory.  (Episodic, because there are gaps.  
<br>
Continuity because I can fill in the gaps with smoothing.  I don't 
<br>
remember putting on my shoes this morning, but I'm wearing shoes now, 
<br>
and I wasn't wearing them in bed last night, so I fill in that I put my 
<br>
shoes on.)
<br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Interesting. An alien (or computer program) that maliciously killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and then scanned your brain into its form of episodic memory might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember being you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you call that entity &quot;me&quot;, even if it has very different goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and emotions from the present you?
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Johnicholas

If it remembered being me, then *it* would call itself me.  Given your 
<br>
description of how that &quot;me&quot; arrived at it's state would cause me to 
<br>
have qualms about the description...but I couldn't deny the rightness of 
<br>
it's claim.  I'd just prefer to not get there that way...and I might 
<br>
well prefer to not be there if I were there.
<br>
<p>P.S.:  I have very different goals and emotions now than I did when I 
<br>
was 12, but I consider both parts of my timeline to be me.
