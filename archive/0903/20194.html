<br>
<p><em>&gt; it could be that consciousness requires 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence but isn't actually intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Well of course consciousness isn’t the same as intelligence! You can
<br>
have consciousness without intelligence but not intelligence without
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A human-equivalent intelligence with no goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't reproduce very effectively in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestral environment
</em><br>
<p>What’s that got to do with the price of eggs? A Do Loop in a computer
<br>
program has a goal.  If you want to get to the heart of the matter the
<br>
question you have to ask is “Can Evolution see consciousness or can it
<br>
not?”.  If it can then the Turing Test works for consciousness and not
<br>
just intelligence and we can know for certain if a computer is
<br>
conscious.  If it can’t then there are only two possibilities to explain
<br>
the observation that at least one conscious being exists in the
<br>
universe:
<br>
<p>1) Consciousness is an inevitable byproduct of intelligence, that is to
<br>
say consciousness is just the way information feels like when it is
<br>
being processed.
<br>
<p>2) Darwin was wrong and the Bible thumpers were right after all.
