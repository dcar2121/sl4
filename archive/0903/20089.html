<p>The teleportation industry might go to great lengths to soundproof the booths so nobody would hear the tormented screams of their customers. Suppose you only found out how it worked after you have used it 100 times. Suppose it costs $100 to teleport anywhere in the world, and for $20 extra you have the option of having the booth filled with a narcotic gas so you die painlessly. How many more times would you teleport before you no longer saw any sense in paying the extra fee?
<br>
<p>These questions are only hard to answer because of the way we are programmed. It is normal to fear those things that decrease the likelihood of passing on your DNA.
