<p><em>&gt; The human brain computes probability based on a model that assumes that

<em>&gt; Suppose you are given a choice of (A) being tortured, and then having the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory of the torture erased, or (B) not being tortured, but then having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false memory of torture programmed into your brain. Our model says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after many trials you will consistently choose (A) even if you prefer not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I assume A also involves ensuring evidence is erased along with memory, such
<br>
that scar and broken limbs have been healed?  If not, I think I'd prefer B -
<br>
since I would probably divorce my identity from that tortured self in much
<br>
the same way I've divorced my current self from the punk I was at age 19.  A
<br>
inexplicable scar or missing limb would be difficult to understand without
<br>
the associated memory.
<br>
<p>I think this example only furthers the point Matt was making about memory,
<br>
identity and probability.
<br>
<p>Consider also your poker strategy against 1) unknown players vs. 2)
<br>
well-known players.  By observation of #1, you hope to observe tendencies
<br>
similar to those of #2 - so you may profitably predict your opponent's
<br>
reaction to your own betting and bluffing behaviors.  A powerfully adaptive
<br>
intelligence would make a formidable Texas Hold'em player: both by reading
<br>
'tells' and presenting false 'tells' of its own.
