<p>Regardless of my personal opinion on the matter, I'd like to hear 
<br>
Samantha's reasons behind this statement.
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Ok, I'll take that &quot;AI faith&quot; reference to at least partially refer to myself.
<br>
<p>On this topic, I'll start by saying my views regarding Ben and Eliezer were 
<br>
not formed capriciously, at random or on a small sampling of information 
<br>
(though, admittedly, smaller than I would like - but I don't have direct 
<br>
access to either of them).  I've been reading this list since March, 2001, 
<br>
and I've corresponded with both Eliezer &amp; Ben via private email.  Based on 
<br>
my personal interactions with both of them and reading their interactions 
<br>
with others on this list:
<br>
<p>1)  I don't think either of them is 100% correct (or anywhere close, 
<br>
probably).
<br>
<p>2)  I don't think the personal views or morality of either is applicable to 
<br>
the population at large
<br>
<p>3)  Both of them are highly intelligent
<br>
<p>4)  Both of them are strong supporters of The Singularity
<br>
<p>However, over the course of this time and the interactions I have witnessed 
<br>
Ben Goertzel has displayed more wisdom and vastly more maturity in MY 
<br>
opinion.  Eliezer S. Yudkowsy is very intelligent, but also very young and 
<br>
inexperienced.
<br>
<p>The people directly responsible for The Singularity, also in MY opinion, 
<br>
should at least:
<br>
<p>1)  Realize that their views are not applicable to everyone
<br>
<p>2)  Value the views and wishes of people who have conflicting beliefs
<br>
<p>3)  Have a good degree of empathy with other humans
<br>
<p>4)  Value human life and free will very highly
<br>
<p>5)  Want to see The Singularity occur (but not so much as to cloud their 
<br>
reasoning)
<br>
<p>6)  Fully realize, believe and know that they could be DEAD WRONG about 
<br>
anything or everything
<br>
<p>7)  Be mature and responsible enough to ensure that The Singularity is done 
<br>
in the best manner possible
<br>
<p>I'm quite certain that I've missed some points here.  This is not intended 
<br>
to be an exhaustive list, just a list to illustrate the reasoning behind my 
<br>
personal opinions.
<br>
<p>Based on my interactions with Ben &amp; Eliezer, viewing their interactions 
<br>
with others and reading some of their published works:
<br>
<p>Eliezer:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully satisfies the statement in #4.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gets partial credit for #1, 2, 5 and slightly less so for #7.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needs much more work on #3 and #6.
<br>
<p>Ben:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fully satisfies the statements in #1, 2, 4, 6 and 7
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have enough details (yet) to know if he only gets partial 
<br>
or full credit for statements #3 &amp; #5.
<br>
<p>This is about as plain and laid out as I can put it.  Hopefully this helps 
<br>
clarify my views and the reasons for which I hold them.
<br>
<p>Please note that this is ONLY MY OPPINION.  I've been completely wrong 
<br>
about things in the past and I don't see any reason why this could not be 
<br>
the case here.  Obviously, at present I don't think I'm wrong - or I'd have 
<br>
different opinions.
<br>
<p>reasonable amount of experience (not the best word) with humanity as a 
<br>
whole.  Time and human interaction breed empathy.
<br>
<p>James Higgins
