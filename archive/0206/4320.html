<p>I do, actually.  Sometimes great scientific achievements are made by people 
<br>
who are no smarter than many other contemporary geniuses but who happen to 
<br>
be in the right place at the right time.  Both Newton and Einstein managed 
<br>
to do it *consistently*, however.  If Einstein had been an ordinary genius, 
<br>
he would have invented Special Relativity on the basis of Michaelson-Morley, 
<br>
but not gone on to invent General Relativity on the basis of essentially 
<br>
*no* evidence.  Almost as astonishing as Einstein's invention of General 
<br>
Relativity is his (absolutely correct) advance confidence in it: on being 
<br>
asked what he would have done if the eclipse observations conflicted with 
<br>
General Relativity, Einstein is said to have replied:  &quot;Then I would have 
<br>
pitied the Good Lord.  The theory is correct.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now of course it could be that Einstein was just overconfident and happened 
<br>
to be right (though this also happened with Special Relativity and 
<br>
Kauffman's apparent disconfirmation), but it's even more unnerving to 
<br>
contemplate whether Einstein's confidence might have been *actually 
<br>
justified*.  Sure, this violates the social rules of science laid down by 
<br>
people who weren't Einstein; what if Einstein was right and they were wrong? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What if Einstein's assigned confidence level was as correct as his theory? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It implies that Einstein didn't have *just enough* intelligence to invent 
<br>
General Relativity; it implies that Einstein had enough intelligence to 
<br>
invent General Relativity and *know* it was correct.  How did he possibly 
<br>
know?  For that matter, how did he invent the theory in the first place?  It 
<br>
seems to me that in some way, Einstein learned to think like the universe 
<br>
well enough to anticipate, in advance of knowing, what kind of physical laws 
<br>
the universe would invent.  Not barely, by the skin of his teeth, but with 
<br>
enough margin that he could do it several times in a row and be confident of 
<br>
his answers in the face of apparent contradictory experimental evidence.
<br>
<p>That's the power of intelligence.  It's quite fashionable to deemphasize the 
<br>
power of individual intelligence in favor of social intelligence these days. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fashionable, but wrong.  Nature is not that fair or democratic.  There is 
<br>
a historical tendency to overattribute problems to famous individuals rather 
<br>
than collaborative efforts, but intelligence is still far more powerful when 
<br>
concentrated in a single individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that some types of problems are more suitable to &quot;lone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geniuses&quot; (a la Einstein, Netwon) whereas others are more suitable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;brilliant teams&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is AGI a lone genius problem or a brilliant team problem?  I think it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brilliant team problem, due to the complex and integrative nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical intelligence.  On the other hand, I think &quot;unifying physics&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of a lone genius sort of problem (as it was in the times of Einstein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Newton)....  But of course these are &quot;just intuitions&quot; ;-&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think the basic nature and architecture of intelligence is a lone genius 
<br>
problem, followed by a brilliant team problem for building all the parts 
<br>
once the *kind* of parts are understood.  I don't think the members of the 
<br>
team have to be quite as brilliant as the lone genius individually, although 
<br>
the total intelligence might be greater collectively.  Fortunately so, 
<br>
because it becomes exponentially harder to find a lone genius as the 
<br>
required intelligence increases linearly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Computer science in general seems to have benefited from collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence at least as much as from &quot;lone genius&quot; style intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Progress in CS has been as substantial as that in physics, yet we don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CS heros on the order of Einstein or Newton to look up to.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't describe AI as a CS problem.
