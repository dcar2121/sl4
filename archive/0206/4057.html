<p>
This is merely another short argument for fostering a safe Singularity soon:
<br>
Nanotech poses an existential risk even without the creation of an
<br>
omnivorous &quot;grey goo&quot;.
<br>
<p>Recently posted on this list was the small reassurance that the power
<br>
problem for nanodevices will be difficult to overcome in such a way that
<br>
would allow rapid and total consumption of the biosphere.  I agree, but
<br>
would like to point out that the reassurance is miniscule indeed, seeing as
<br>
how a small degree of intelligence in a dedicated doomsday device would
<br>
nicely get around the problem.
<br>
<p>Consider for a moment the myriad of existing pathogens and toxins that can
<br>
be lethal to humans even in very tiny amounts.  An artillery shell full of
<br>
anthrax spores, it has been said, could potentially kill everyone on earth
<br>
if these spores could somehow be distributed among all human lungs.  Nerve
<br>
agents are perhaps a few orders of magnitude below this in terms of killing
<br>
capacity per volume on account of their non-replicating nature, but a
<br>
swimming pool's worth of Sarin could probably do in the species nicely --
<br>
provided it could be delivered equitably.  It is this crucial question of
<br>
delivery that makes these &quot;poor-man's nukes&quot; so difficult to use to their
<br>
fullest, but this is the very question that nanotechnology -- or possibly
<br>
even MEMS technology -- could be capable of solving.  The combination of
<br>
tried and true killing substances -- biological or chemical -- with
<br>
bulk-manufactured intelligent delivery devices creates the existential
<br>
menace I call the Eclectic Pseudoplague.
<br>
<p>In the more advanced manifestation of this approach, a doomsday terrorist
<br>
would design a self-replicating nano-device that, in it's &quot;spore&quot; phase
<br>
spreads, locates, and feeds off some readily consumed (if not quite
<br>
ubiquitous) power source, like electricity or petrochemicals.  In it's
<br>
&quot;incubatory&quot; phase it multiplies and begins to synthesize the following:
<br>
ultraconcentrated stores of toxins or viral agents, vehicles (with their
<br>
required energy reserves) for delivering these substances, and additional
<br>
propagation spores -- all according to programmed timetables and criteria.
<br>
In it's early &quot;reproductive&quot; phase it spreads spores to begin creating new
<br>
colonies attached to remote energy sources.  In all cases with sufficient
<br>
available energy, a &quot;kill&quot; phase is reached, upon which the colony releases
<br>
it's swarm of delivery vehicles.  Depending on the toxin or pathogen, these
<br>
devices might be just above or below the microscopic threshold, and would
<br>
crawl, swim or fly, navigating by detection of infrared radiation or carbon
<br>
dioxide emissions the way parasitic insects do.  Due to the toxicity of the
<br>
payloads and the high likelihood of each victim receiving multiple doses,
<br>
fatality rates among victims would be extremely high.  And unlike biological
<br>
plagues that &quot;burn out&quot; on account of their killing all the available hosts
<br>
before these can spread the illness, such an advanced Eclectic Pseudoplague
<br>
could continue spreading unabated, since it does not rely on the victims to
<br>
act as hosts or vectors.  It is not hard to imagine that such a plague could
<br>
pose an existential threat, with most of the killing happening quickly and
<br>
the rest happening eventually as survivors found it impossible to hide out
<br>
forever in the extremely secure environments that would be necessary.
<br>
Interestingly, such a plague would spread quickest and most thoroughly in
<br>
developed areas (where the designated ready-energy source would be most
<br>
abundant), ensuring that a non-existential outcome would set civilization
<br>
back as far as possible.
<br>
<p>In far-less advanced -- but still sufficiently terrifying -- manifestations
<br>
of Eclectic Pseudoplague, a doomsday terrorist would work with a pre-made
<br>
batch of delivery vehicles filled with a pre-made batch of toxins.  Billions
<br>
or trillions of killing vehicles could fit in a relatively small space, even
<br>
if these were the size of mosquitoes or houseflies.  With relatively simple
<br>
algorithms programmed in to ensure that these spread out as much as
<br>
possible, combined with a synchronized distribution of the devices in many
<br>
different starting areas, the effectiveness of a single pre-made stockpile
<br>
could be catastrophic.  While perhaps not posing the existential risk of the
<br>
former scenario, the casualties from such an attack could easily reach the
<br>
point where current economies would collapse and set civilization back
<br>
decades or centuries.  An undesirable occurrence, to say the least.

<br>
sounds like a tasteless Hollywood blockbuster just waiting to happen)
