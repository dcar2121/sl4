<p>Actually, I was thinking about this earlier, glad you asked.
<br>
<p>I think the best solution would be to assemble a board of maybe 10 
<br>
people.  These people should be intelligent, but not necessarily 
<br>
geniuses.  Some should be experts on AI, but not all.  I would say the 
<br>
criteria ALL members must posses would be:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  A strong desire to see the Singularity occur
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Strongly value human life and the survival of the human race
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Must be willing and able to accept that a solution, other than 
<br>
their own, is a better solution
<br>
<p>The deciding body SHOULD NOT have exactly coinciding interest.  They should 
<br>
not, under any circumstances, all be working on the same project (such as 
<br>
the Singularity Institute).
<br>
<p>Ideally, I think deployment (kick off) of a Singularity project would be 
<br>
impossible without the agreement of this group.  (the keys would not be in 
<br>
the possession of the developers).  All 10 people would have to agree in 
<br>
order to launch a Singularity attempt.  Ideally this same group would 
<br>
oversee all potential Singularity projects, so that they could analyze, 
<br>
compare and pick the one with the best potential to be launched.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You keep comparing your decisions to go forward to other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complex problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you denying the ultility of &quot;learning from past mistakes&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely not.  But if the moon shot failed it would not have killed all 
<br>
humanity.  The only possibly equal project I know of would have been the 
<br>
Manhattan Project.  If I recall correctly some of them thought a chain 
<br>
reaction could have occurred and would have destroy the earth.  Hopefully 
<br>
they fully researched this possibility before testing the first bomb.
