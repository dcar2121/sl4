<p>Yes, laws, backed by barrels of guns. The nasty old spiel.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I bet you believe in gun control too (because we all know if you outlaw all 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It depends on the nature of surveillance and enforcement, but, yes, you 
<br>
can completely outlaw guns for all practical purposes. Technology actually 
<br>
increases the asymmetry between thugs/spooks and subjects.
<br>
<p>I'm actually monitoring the legal and technological landscape from a
<br>
cypherpunk perspective, and it certainly doesn't look good. Recent 9/11
<br>
craze is just the (rather unpalatable) icing on the cake of longterm
<br>
trends.
<br>

<p>Because he otherwise will get his pants sued off, lose his entire assets
<br>
and will land in jail for the rest of her life, or worse?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; time anyone even realized that they didn't it would be too late.  Not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention the fact that it takes government bodies YEARS to understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderately complicated technology.  Look at the Internet for an example, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many government bodies still don't get it; and that is based on 20+ year 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old technology...
</em><br>
<p>The global communication networks are rapidly becoming one of the most
<br>
transparent, most subject to spook scrutiny places mankind ever created.  
<br>
In absence of cryptoanarchy (which has very mundane reasons for not
<br>
materializing) technology advances immediately translate into better
<br>
surveillance and control. Here AI technologies (ubiquitous realtime
<br>
biosignature capturing, data warehouse analysis) are a distinctly
<br>
double-edged sword.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Do you suppose the superintelligence will obey the laws too?  (sorry, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't resist)
</em><br>
<p>I specifically excluded feasibility of control on later stages of
<br>
Singularity. It is a degenerate development in that respect, since it
<br>
tends so erase information about its nucleation event. It has a natural
<br>
basin of atraction.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; And these regulations is why there have never been any bio-terrorism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems?  Oh wait, there have been.  Well, all it would take is ONE 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, we don't have any bioterrorism problems. The amount of
<br>
disruption (which is very real) is completely within people's heads. I
<br>
don't think sustainable disruption is possible given that people will
<br>
adapt, up to a point. (Remember bombings of England's cities during WWII).
<br>
<p>I put that watershed threshold at megadeaths due to bioterrorism. If you
<br>
look at the outcome of a number of current simulations, this is a very
<br>
high threshold to achieve for a small group. Apart from high efficiency
<br>
into modes of deployment it absolutely requires pathogen engineering.  
<br>
Effective pathogen engineering is decades away even for a major government
<br>
lab.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Singularity incident and that's it.  Thinking that ANY regulation could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have ANY noticeable effect on this problem is ridiculous.  Unless you plan 
</em><br>
<p>Thinking that regulations have no effect whatseover is naive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to take away everyone's computers and closely observe what is being done 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the few computers you do allow.  Is that what you are proposing?
</em><br>
<p>This is not what I'm proposing, but it can be done, and it will be done if
<br>
we're really unlucky. In fact I can point you to a large contemporary 
<br>
initiative from the side of the industry, spearheaded by copyright 
<br>
enforcement (but 9/11 events do make it easier).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; My apologies, in advance, to the list for not playing nice in this post.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just couldn't believe this is a serious suggestion.
</em><br>
<p>You're very welcome to shoot my argumentation full of gaping bleeding
<br>
holes. (I, of course, reserve the right to return the same in kind ;P ).
