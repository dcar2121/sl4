<em>&gt;&gt;many people on here do not agree with your opinion about the &quot;current

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for a useless (in the eyes of the Singularity) debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why?  The debate needs some grounding.  When there are proposals afloat to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have the FAI be developed by military and under orders from the Commander 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Chief it is very important to look at what that can mean in very real

<em>&gt;scaried given the current situations and proclivities of such deployment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and control of SAI is in my opinion vastly disconnected from reality - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quite dangerously so.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not at all opposed to such discussions, just pointless political jabs 
<br>
(in any direction).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;Besides, most views of a political figure's actual morals, based solely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on their &quot;public life&quot; or career, are almost certainly to be wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;That includes my views on political figures I dislike as well.  If the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;situation you suggest were to appear likely I'd like to get them involved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in a forum such as this for many months before making any personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;judgements about their morals (of course this would never happen - though).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;All I need to do is look at the public figure's public actions and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statements to decide what I think of them qua public figure and how much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a danger I believe they represent.  The stated endless War plans of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current administration are more than sufficient to gauge the advisability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of having any real AI owned by the military or the government
</em><br>
<p>I believe if you put a highly moral and intelligent person, who truly did 
<br>
have the interest of the people above their own, into Congress they 
<br>
wouldn't look any different from an external observer.  Changes need to be 
<br>
made to make political offices in the US less correctable.  But as it 
<br>
stands every senator &amp; representative has to play the game to get anything 
<br>
done.  I tend to think this discussion (corruption of politics) is off 
<br>
topic for SL4, but I may be wrong.
