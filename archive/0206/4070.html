<p>I would have to disagree with you on this point.  My thoughts are *not*
<br>
constrained by my emotional acceptence of the outcomes.  My actions may be
<br>
constrained in this way, but not my thoughts.  I can think through a bunch
<br>
of ideas, with moral outcomes that I find utterly revolting... but that
<br>
doesn't prevent me from thinking accurately and rationally about them.  Now
<br>
someone might argue: &quot;But your own thoughts are a single data point that may
<br>
not apply to others&quot;  And I would respond: Uh-huh, but there have been many
<br>
fine philosphers and debaters who were as-good-as-they-were precisely
<br>
because they could think accurately from the POV of thier
<br>
detractors/opponents.  They did not have to accept the conclusions/outcomes
<br>
in order to think about them well... or &quot;find the math&quot; as Eliezer writes.
<br>
<p>Now it just so happens that I agree with the viewpoint that &quot;there may be
<br>
something better than biological humans&quot;.  But that emphatically does not
<br>
imply that I would wish ill on even a single human being!  Any more than I
<br>
would wish ill on a dog because its master is 'better' in some ways.  One
<br>
can hold both ideas as being true and valid without any contradiction
<br>
whatever.  Not only that, but whole point of Friendly AI is to be able to
<br>
get SI without humanity going extinct and without harming a single person
<br>
either.
<br>
<p>This whole enterprise (building SI) is about expanding humanity's options,
<br>
not reducing them.  Not reducing them in any way.  Talking about
<br>
far-out/extreme/unlikely situations where one has to choose who lives and
<br>
who dies, while an interesting exercise, does NOT indicate what choices will
<br>
be *likely* in 99.999...% of situations.  Black and White, Either/Or
<br>
decisions are great movie-time fodder, but in real life there are *always*
<br>
other options.  For example, in Gordon's little pastiche about the SI and
<br>
the mob, there are many other options... the most obvious being:

Michael is sitting at a traffic light in a late model minivan with &quot;The AI
<br>
Shaggin Waggin&quot; emblazoned on the side.  Looking up the street he can just
<br>
see a crowd of people, gathered around headquarters, waving signs.  He
<br>
calmly picks up his cell phone and dial's Gordon's number.  Gordon answers
<br>
immediately,
<br>
&quot;Yo!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Michael here.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Hey, Mike... I'm all alone in here man!  An' there's a freekin' MOB
<br>
outside.&quot;, his voice sounds frightened.
<br>
&quot;Gordon, I'm a block away.  Meet me at the loading dock on the west side.&quot;
<br>
&quot;I can't do that!&quot;, he screams, &quot;They'll destroy everything!&quot;.
<br>
&quot;Calm down, Gord, we got the Seed backed up from here to Cleveland, just get
<br>
outa there!  Its not worth risking your life for.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Shit!  They just broke through the gate... okay, okay... west side loading
<br>
dock, I'm going there now&quot;
