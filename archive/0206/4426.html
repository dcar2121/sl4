<em>&gt;Rather than try to persuade most of you why this is should be the case,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Currently I manage Cycorp's participation in a Darpa project and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trust this process - and believe it will work for ensuring Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<p>Um, small problem here.  DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research (something) 
<br>
Association, is part of the Defense Department.  Or, more bluntly, the 
<br>
Military.  What are the ultimate goals behind the research projects DARPA 
<br>
sponsors?  To create technology useable by the military.
<br>
<p>If such an agency were to attempt the Singularity (or just transhuman AI) 
<br>
it would certainly try to constrain and control the result.  And it may not 
<br>
exactly want &quot;Friendliness&quot;.  After all, if the Defense Department needs to 
<br>
attack another country using information warfare, wouldn't you want your 
<br>
pet AI to be involved?  Woulnd't work out very well if the AI always 
<br>
answered that the things it was asked to do were not friendly and, thus, it 
<br>
could not cooperate.
<br>
<p>Not to mention the fact that if a Singularity were to be attempted by ANY 
<br>
government nation there would be so much special interest represented that 
<br>
it could never be done safely.  Most likely, it could never be done.
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I like DARPA and I thank them very much for the 
<br>
Internet.  But I just don't think AI or the Singularity is something I want 
<br>
them involved in.
