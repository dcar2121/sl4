<p>Many things could make a person extremely confidant despite being very, 
<br>
very wrong.  Even if the truth is spelled out in 100 foot tall letters, in 
<br>
plain view right in front of them.  (I'm having to deal with such an 
<br>
individual in real life presently).  Everyone I have ever dealt with that 
<br>
behaves in this manor has either been off by a significant degree (but 
<br>
refusing to consider such a concept) or wholly detached from reality.  I'm 
<br>
quite certain that there are people who display that much raw ego who are 
<br>
100% correct, I just haven't personally met one yet.  On the other hand the 
<br>
few truly brilliant people I have met constantly question themselves and 
<br>
rarely, if ever, display much ego.
<br>
<p>I don't offer this info to insult or disrespect anyone.  I offer it because 
<br>
I think a good number of people share this viewpoint and while you may not 
<br>
agree, in many circumstances you may go much further with some genuine modesty.
<br>
<p>Personally, I know I'm exceptionally good at software engineering and 
<br>
especially good at designing &amp; comprehending large, complex 
<br>
architectures.  I know this mostly because I've been told such and it has 
<br>
been demonstrated to me time and again.  (I honestly thought I was horrible 
<br>
up until 8 or so years ago when I started working with many other people in 
<br>
the field).  But there are numerous people out there that simply must be 
<br>
vastly better than I, even at these things.  Plus I am absolutely certain 
<br>
there are when it comes to specialized subjects such as AI.  Most people on 
<br>
this list would probably make me look silly in comparison on that 
<br>
topic!  Even when comfortably within in one of my prime areas I try (and 
<br>
sometimes it is difficult) to be modest.  However, I've found it gets you 
<br>
much further (which is why I try).  Maybe you should give it another try 
<br>
before dismissing it...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The strongest statement I would make about Friendly AI is &quot;I've been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking at this section of floor for two years, I have my trap detectors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shoved out to absolute maximum, and I still haven't detected any basic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;flaws, so at this point, even taking into account how much is at stake, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm ready to put one foot down and start shifting my weight over.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Hey, if you want to take solo risks of falling though the floor, be my 
<br>
guest.  But when doing so could wipe out all life on earth, please 
<br>
don't.  If for no other reason than if you were to fall though the floor 
<br>
there would be no one alongside to pickup the pieces and carry on (or 
<br>
effectively do damage control)...
<br>
<p>I'd much rather get a few thousand of the brightest people on the planet to 
<br>
look at the floor for two years before you took that first step.  Letting 
<br>
your ego prod you to go it mostly alone is insane given the circumstances.
<br>
<p>Hell, if I had to give the answer to &quot;623 + 377&quot; but giving the wrong 
<br>
answer would kill, well, even ONE person I'd get like 10 other opinions 
<br>
before answering!  And if even one of them was different I'd get 20 more, etc.
