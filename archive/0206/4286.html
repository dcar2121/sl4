</em><br>
<p>Actually, if you can invent a time machine and travel back to any point in 
<br>
history without destroying reality, does it really matter WHEN you invent 
<br>
time travel?
<br>
<p>Here's an interesting idea I just thought of.  Once time travel is possible 
<br>
go back and record the minds of everyone that has ever lived.  Then kick 
<br>
off a bunch of simulations for every period in time (there would probably 
<br>
need to be some degree of overlap).  Load the recorded minds into the 
<br>
simulations at the exact point they were recorded (thus maintaining their 
<br>
reality).  Then devise a plausible time line by which each era creates 
<br>
their own Singularity as a means to bring all of these minds into the 
<br>
&quot;present&quot; (real) reality gradually.  Maybe our reality is one of these and 
<br>
the only reason the Singularity is likely to occur during our lifetime is 
<br>
because the simulation is designed as such.  Unfortunately, such musings 
<br>
are not very useful as we won't know such things until after a Singularity 
<br>
occurs (if ever)...
