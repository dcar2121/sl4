<em>&gt; It seems to me that Ray's efforts could prove immensely catalytic in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparing the mind-set of intelligent people in the USA and elsewhere to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept and embrace the Singularity prospect, making it vastly easier for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the developers of the relevant technologies to advance without being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crushed or ignored. I tried earlier to do the same thing with THE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SPIKE and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION, but alas simply didn't have the leverage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make much difference (outside Oz). In our ways, it seems to me, Kurzweil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I (and other writer/analyst/promoters going back to Ed Regis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond) are doing quite a lot to `make it occur' in a responsible way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien Broderick
</em><br>
<p><p>Damien, I fully agree.  There is more than one way to urge and shape the
<br>
Singularity; technical work is certainly not the only valuable path.  For
<br>
one thing, books and speeches like Kurzweil's will encourage more young
<br>
people to do concrete technical Singularity-focused work!  And it will put
<br>
the Singularity into the minds of the next generation, so a few years down
<br>
the road, funding for kooky singularity-ish project may be slightly less
<br>
painful to come by, who knows....  And many other useful purposes besides...
<br>
<p>Kurzweil's view is that the Singularity will come about as the consequence
<br>
of a whole lot of different technologies all converging, in a very general
<br>
way.  Thus, he does not see funding any particular type of technology (e.g.
<br>
AI) as being critically helpful to bringing the Singularity about.  This is
<br>
really his major disagreement with Eliezer and myself.  We believe that a
<br>
quicker and better Singularity can likely be brought about by focusing more
<br>
resources on AGI engineering and teaching.  Kurzweil believes that the
<br>
Singularity will be brought about by a gradual convergence of neuroscience,
<br>
molecular biology, computing technology, brain scan technology, etc. etc.
<br>
And he is not rich enough to make a real impact across all those fields via
<br>
investing his $$.  Nor does he have an amazing technical insight that will
<br>
revolutionize one or more of these fields.  So from his point of view, what
<br>
he is doing is really by far the best thing he can do to help the
<br>
singularity happen and happen well.
