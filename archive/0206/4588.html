<p>Certainly, although last I checked M$ Word wasn't self modifying. That's
<br>
the point all my devil's advocacy is about: if you get to the point where
<br>
you have running self modifying code, you should already have in place
<br>
plenty of safety measures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I could give you a long list of other people with would-be-AGI systems:
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess the reason you're pushing me on this issue, and not them, may partly

</em><br>
<em>&gt; success than these others, though quite strong, is much, much weaker than my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very solid knowledge that the current code base *cannot go superhuman*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, no the reason is just that you're around and willing to talk
<br>
about it. Which I do have to give you a lot of credit for. I'll be even
<br>
more impressed if you do eventually get out your &quot;social policy&quot; for
<br>
criticism well before you get your total codebase running. I believe anyone
<br>
of them, you, us, or anyone else working on this stuff needs to have concrete
<br>
well-documented plans for how to deal with these issues well before they get
<br>
near the point of actual testing. If one of them was here instead of you I'd
<br>
be pressuring them just the same... hopefully they are getting the message
<br>
by lurking.
<br>
<p>I am still concerned that your commercial focus may be causing you to
<br>
cut dangerous corners in the long run, hopefully you'll address that in
<br>
your eventual documentation. Have a good vacation! :-)
