<p>And there's certainly intelligent debate about the merits of the EU,
<br>
too, at least here in Sweden. It seems many people here believe the
<br>
government is at least slightly out-of-control. Similar, though more
<br>
vague, sentiments can easily be found in the UK and New Zealand, too, in
<br>
my experience.
<br>
<p>Which leaves us in a way with &quot;national governments will surrender
<br>
sovereignty occasionally at random&quot; (ie., under the control of something
<br>
other than those who elected them).
<br>
<p>And, in fact, &quot;national governments are not rational&quot; (from the POV of
<br>
their electors, that is, since the govts are acting based on a hidden
<br>
variable, ie. the wishes of the non-electing controlling
<br>
entity/system/etc).
<br>
<p>I don't want a nonsentient memetic replicator (such as a government or
<br>
church) in control of my singularity, thank you very much ;-) All it
<br>
wants to do is copy itself! ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; don't think the US government has any clear demonstrated ability 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>... or something! What the hell is really going on? I get this queasy
<br>
feeling sometimes that we're cells in a much larger organism or entity
<br>
that we can't perceive properly...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a pity we in the US no longer in reality practice 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As with EU, NAFTA, privatisation efforts in New Zealand, the UK, etc.
<br>
Once people noticed what was happening, it was too late.
