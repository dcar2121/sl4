<p>
Eliezer...
<br>
<p>Ah, I think I was interpreting the phrase &quot;after the fact&quot; differently than
<br>
you
<br>
<p>My point was that evolution-of-species theory has never successfully
<br>
predicted the evolution of a new species.
<br>
<p>I.e., it has never made a successful prediction about a future event.
<br>
<p>It has *sort of* made predictions about past events that were unknown at the
<br>
time the prediction was made
<br>
<p>By &quot;sort of&quot;, I mean
<br>
<p>-- It has never predicted the details of an unknown *past* species, which
<br>
was later discovered, after the prediction was made
<br>
<p>-- BUT, it has predicted the *general characteristics* of some unknown
<br>
species, which were later discovered, after the prediction was made (by
<br>
identifying &quot;missing links&quot; in evolutionary trees built from past species
<br>
already discovered)
<br>
<p>This evidential weakness is why there are still some fairly intelligent
<br>
people pushing Scientific Creationism (though I am not one of them!)
<br>
<p>Cosmology has actually done better.  The Big Bang theory has actually
<br>
successfully predicted a present &amp; future event: the cosmic background
<br>
radiation at the exact wavelength predicted by the Big Bang equations.  This
<br>
empirical prediction, when validated by Arno Penzias &amp; co. (in the 60's, I
<br>
think?), put an end to the Steady State Theory for all but a few diehards.
<br>
<p>Still, these two theories do not at all fit the classic Popperian model of
<br>
science as experimental, or predictive.  They are much more
<br>
&quot;rationalizations&quot; of observed evidence, after the fact (the observation of
<br>
the cosmic background radiation being an important exception).
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Science does not REQUIRE prediction before the fact, it only prefers it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well-known counterexamples are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -- The theory of the evolution of species by natural selection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -- Cosmology: the theory of the origin of the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Neither of these, at this point, has made any verifiable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the fact ;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cosmology is not my field, but I find your statement astounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the evolution of species.  It is true that it is difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance, the exact DNA sequence, which exact mutations will occur in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeeding generation, and so on.  But evolution makes very specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions which are not made by the alternate hypotheses of either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent design or Lamarckian adaptation about what *kind* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designs we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to see - incrementally evolvable ones - and very tightly constrains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the space of what we expect to see relative to alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypotheses.  Each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and every time new observations fall within that very tight space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design signature predicted by evolution, and not the spaces and signatures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicted by Lamarckian inheritance or intelligent design, the theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution racks up another successful ante facto prediction.
</em><br>
