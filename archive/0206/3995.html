Samantha,

<em>&gt; Well, in my personal opinion and speaking plainly, disowning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's species, literally all of humanity include one's self and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loved ones, for an unknown set of hopefully stable higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences is a very deep form of treason and betrays a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singular contempt for humanity that I find utterly apalling.
</em><br>
<p>But I really feel this is not correct.
<br>
<p>The attitude you describe does not necessarily imply a *contempt* for
<br>
humanity.
<br>
<p>On the contrary, it *could* imply this, but it could also imply a mere
<br>
*indifference* to humanity.
<br>
<p>I confess that I feel somewhat indifferent to humanity, sometimes (not
<br>
always!).  Sometimes I just think of humanity as a vehicle for intelligent
<br>
mind.  And, I think: If a better vehicle comes along, why is the
<br>
human-vehicle so important?  And why are our individual human minds --
<br>
including mine -- so important.  In the big picture of the evolution of life
<br>
and mind in the cosmos, surely they aren't....
<br>
<p>Sure, the human race is important to me emotionally... just like my family
<br>
is important to me emotionally ... just as my own limbs are important to me
<br>
emotionally ...    but why are my personal human emotions so important?
<br>
<p>Indifference to humanity could come out of nihilism. But it could also come
<br>
out of having values that go beyond any particular species, or any
<br>
particular vehicle, and focus on general things like intelligence and
<br>
creation.
<br>
<p>In short, there are MANY different psychological motives that could underly
<br>
the attitude Mike displays, contempt being only one of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How about we just grow a lot more sane human beings instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digging continuously for technological fixes that really aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixes to the too often cussedness of local sentients?  Replacing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them with something that is faster and arguably smarter but may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or may not be any more wise is not an answer.  Scrapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients is to be frowned upon even if you think you can and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even do create sentients that are arguably better along some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parameters.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Wisdom&quot; is a nebulous human concept that means different things to
<br>
different people, and in different cultures.
<br>
<p>However, I think it's pretty likely that intelligent software WILL be wiser
<br>
than humans, due to reasons Eliezer has pointed out nicely in his writings.
<br>
We have an evolutionary heritage that makes it really tough for us to be
<br>
wise, and there seems to be no reason why intelligent software would have
<br>
any similar problem.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
