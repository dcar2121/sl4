</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum of paths to the Singularity in my reply to Kurzweil, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrating specifically on those research directions (brain-computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfaces, integrative computational neurology) that Kurzweil has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singled out as important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The morality of the question is difficult to be fully clear about.  It 
<br>
is not at all clear whethet an earlier Singularity is in fact a good 
<br>
thing.  It depends strongly on the how the Singularity is shaped.  If it 
<br>
is shaped wrongly it could mean the deaths of all of us and an SI born 
<br>
within it may not survive long either.
<br>
<p>On funding various types of research that would be useful to our fondest 
<br>
goals, I am of two minds.  In the marketplace funding something at the 
<br>
wrong time can simply waste one's resources to no great effect. 
<br>
Kurzweil has a proven track record of funding new technology at a time 
<br>
when it is accepted and generates adequate revenue.  He has a track 
<br>
record of innovation.  I personally wish some of his innovations were 
<br>
more accessible to other researchers and efforts, but I have to give him 
<br>
his due.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If Kurzweil chooses to become an activist on behalf of *any* technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he believes is the most critical, the most neglected link on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; path to Singularity, I will applaud the ethics and responsibility of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that moral decision *before* raising any issues with his choice of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology.  If Kurzweil decides to throw his full efforts behind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementing the Singularity, others will follow in his footsteps, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different choices of key technology, and whatever real critical links 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist will be funded eventually.  
</em><br>
<p>I see him building awareness and momentum now and stepping back, for 
<br>
now, from taking any technological lead.  Perhaps he believes more can 
<br>
be accomplished by him at this point in that capacity and/or that 
<br>
technology is proceeding apace in any case.  I am a little worried to 
<br>
see you or anyone casting moral aspersions on another if there actions 
<br>
are not what you would have done in their place.  I don't think that is 
<br>
very fruitful.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What I fear is a world in which people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear about the Singularity and use it to rationalize whatever they were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already doing. What I fear is a world in which Kurzweil, as the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presenter of the Singularity meme, inadvertantly inoculates his audience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the idea that we can derive comfort from the Singularity concept 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without *doing* anything to achieve the actual Singularity.  If this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens, spreading the word about the Singularity will do nothing to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve the humanistic goal that is the Singularity itself, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who insist that the Singularity is a religion will be right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Producing and forwarding the meme is no small contribution.  If the meme 
<br>
catches fire the technologists and investors will follow.
<br>
<p>At this point it is not at all clear that &quot;humanistic&quot; is applicable to 
<br>
a Singularity that might well spell the doom of all humans.   I don't 
<br>
know what Singularity as religion has to do with this conversation one 
<br>
way or the other.
