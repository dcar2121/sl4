<p><em>&gt; I was brainstorming a bit about your P2P project, and came up with some

<em>&gt; ideas.  Just food for thought, nothing I'm taking too seriously at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, one of the ways to attract funding to the project would be to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a particular application with the P2P software, and get a decent-sized pool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of users.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing that people *could* do with P2P is distributed problem-solving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're aware of distributed.net and SETI@home and other similar projects ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are all purely client-server based though.  A more innovatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structured such application could attract a lot of attention.
</em><br>
<p>I want to write a super-peer network for knowledge exchange among OpenCyc
<br>
images.  A reference is:
<br>
<a href="http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2002-13">http://dbpubs.stanford.edu:8090/pub/2002-13</a>
<br>
<p>We have 23,000 downloads of OpenCyc for Linux since April.  Shortly we
<br>
will introduce a Win32 version, which I expect to have triple the download
<br>
rate.  The majority of these downloaders are put off by the fact that
<br>
OpenCyc does not have an English chat interface.  If that aspect were
<br>
sufficiently addressed I imagine that by this time next year we could have
<br>
over 100,000 OpenCyc downloads with a majority of somewhat satisfied
<br>
users.  We will introduce a &quot;knowledge grid adapter&quot; that ties the
<br>
downloaded OpenCyc software into the super-peer network that we control.
<br>
The user gives us some machine cycles as the entry price for knowledge
<br>
grid inclusion.  This is similar in operation to &quot;spy-ware&quot; but ethically
<br>
different in that the user must download and install the knowledge grid
<br>
adapter as a deliberate decision.
<br>
<p>With a super-peer network, we should have over 10,000 OpenCyc servers
<br>
under central/hierarchical control for running Cyc applications.  There is
<br>
of course high latency among the nodes but many Cyc activities have a
<br>
large grain size in comparison to the latency cost.  For example,
<br>
extracting assertions from text is very time consuming, but if the
<br>
documents were distributed among many servers the speed up is almost
<br>
linear.
<br>
<p>Regarding the details of the super-peer network, I believe that each
<br>
joining node could quickly test its available bandwidth and also learn
<br>
from the user its availability (always on the internet? static IP
<br>
address?)  So given knowledge of the computational power and availability,
<br>
the central control could designate super peers to be responsible for say
<br>
a group of 50 casual nodes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a potential Novamente tie-in here, in that we could use Novamente
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do the problem-solving within the distributed architecture...  Not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-smart Novamente install of course (we're assuming crappy commodity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PC's), but select bits of Novamente appropriately chosen...
</em><br>
<p>Over time we can work out ways for our respective projects (including
<br>
all on this list) to collaborate. If nothing else, OpenCyc could provide
<br>
a transport layer or an implementation pattern to follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Next question as one pursues this line of thinking: What is the particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; application, in the vein of finding extraterrestrial life or prime numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or protein-folding?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My first thought was the bio work we're now doing -- looking for patterns in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gene expression data.  This is &quot;searching for the cure for cancer&quot; and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has some sex appeal...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then I thought of terrorism.  How about searching public info databases for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information pertinent to terrorism?  There are some useful historical DB's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out there I believe.  &quot;Download this app and use your computer's spare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycles to help fight terrorism!&quot; has a certain mass appeal to it, nyet?  ;-&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Cycorp has several proposals pending in this domain, about which I cannot
<br>
yet comment.  But we know US government interest is very high on this
<br>
topic and I exactly agree with your idea: use open-source materials to combat
<br>
terrorism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I fully understand that such a project (anything vaguely in this vein) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not bring anyone any revenue, but it could get a lot of press (esp. the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism angle), which would open a lot of doors for funding.  In the early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days of Webmind, our first real round of funding (not seed money) came on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the heels of a Wall Street Journal article about us...
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
