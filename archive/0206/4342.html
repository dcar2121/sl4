<p>The question is too simple for this example.  In this case I would 
<br>
obviously answer in under 1 minute because the answer is obvious, provable 
<br>
and checkable.  All in less than 1 minute.
<br>
<p>Now, asked a more difficult question where 1 person would die per minute 
<br>
but 1,000 would die if the answer was incorrect, I'd sacrifice a few lives 
<br>
to verify appropriately.  I'd probably work until 10 people had died or I 
<br>
was 99.99% certain the answer was correct.  I would NOT like this and it 
<br>
would probably bother me for a long time, but it would be the most rational 
<br>
course of action.  Even though it would probably haunt me for the rest of 
<br>
my life...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Let's say you're 90% (+-5%) sure that the answer is: 1000.  Would you

</em><br>

<em>&gt;It is rational to check with others to see if your theories of

</em><br>
<p>Wrong, dead wrong.  For one thing, why bother to check with others if you 
<br>
just plan to ignore them anyway?  It is irrational to proceed unless there 
<br>
is no other choice.  ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING that could lead to the extinction 
<br>
of the human race MUST BE checked, rechecked, checked again, etc.  To the 
<br>
maximum extent possible.  A 10% risk of extinction is way, way too 
<br>
high.  Unless, of course, the result of not acting IMMEDIATELY became equal 
<br>
to or worse than the result of failure.  Maybe at 0.01% chance of 
<br>
extinction I might back off my stance if a very significant number of 
<br>
deaths were occurring continuously.
