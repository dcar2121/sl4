<p>Can we write useful, provably correct systems? No. Can we write secure

systems? No. Okay, can we at least write gracefully failing systems? No.
<br>
Can we generate code to specs automatically? No. Can we design massively
<br>
parallel systems, where millions of asynchronous objects distributed over
<br>
thousands of small processors do meaningful work? No. Do we have any clue
<br>
as to how break through the complexity bareer, using nonstochastical
<br>
methods (coder monkeys)? No and no.
<br>
<p>There's no need to go on. We haven't had any palpable progress in the last
<br>
decade, arguably two. In fact, the average code quality is decreasing,
<br>
though to different reasons.

<p>It is probably doing a great deal worse.
