<p>Physics doesn't look dead to me now.  What, exactly, is a state-vector 
<br>
reduction?  When does it occur?  (And don't tell me that it occurs in 
<br>
response to an &quot;observation&quot;; what, exactly, is an observation?)  Is or is 
<br>
not time travel permitted under the rules of General Relativity?  What does 
<br>
spacetime look like at the center of a black hole?  Why does the universe 
<br>
have the laws it does?  (Don't tell me this is &quot;philosophy&quot;; current physics 
<br>
may not be able to constrain the answers or even the form of the answers 
<br>
using current observations, but that doesn't mean no answer exists.  There's 
<br>
a lot of complex, coherent information bound up in the laws of physics.)
<br>
<p>We are not finished yet.  But as for giving the universe eleven dimensions 
<br>
in order to try and more exactly explain the values of a few constants, 
<br>
without explaining the above questions... well, the word &quot;epicycles&quot; comes 
<br>
to mind.  My guess is that physics is ripe for a revolution and it won't 
<br>
come out of a massive, expensive particle accelerator; it will be a tabletop 
<br>
experiment investigating the nature of state-vector reduction.
