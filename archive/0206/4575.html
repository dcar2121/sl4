</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; people talk to each other when they're not debating a scientist or
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Zen isn't really focused on talking or debating at all.  Words are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; not perceived as very  meaningful.  They're used only to lead you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; beyond words, and sparingly.  The beginning of Zen was the &quot;wordless
</em><br>
<em> &gt; transmission&quot; ...
</em><br>
<p>Zen is a pretty special case as religions go.  If you leave out the
<br>
mystical story surrounding it, then Zen may not contradict
<br>
rationality... nor religion, for that matter.  It would depend on
<br>
whether you wished to achieve enlightenment (losing your wish to do so
<br>
in the process, of course).  So in that case, while a Friendly AI is
<br>
either unenlightenable or born enlightened depending on your viewpoint,
<br>
it would not be a matter of Friendly AI.  Nor would I expect Zen
<br>
practitioners to wish it so.  So, in that sense at least, I don't see a
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>Zen plus the backstory is a religion, though.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; Anyway, let's keep this conversation focused.  Ben, is it your
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; assertion that even if the Jewish or Buddhist religion were
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; correct, this would not be apparent to a Friendly AI that had been
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; programmed by atheists? Because *I* would most certainly regard
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; this as a bug.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I don't think that Zen is the sort of thing that can be correct or
</em><br>
<em> &gt; incorrect.  It's a different sort of thing than that.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It just is.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  Though even Zen may be desirable or undesirable to an outsider
<br>
such as myself (ironically, I think Zen is pretty cool, though not in a
<br>
religious way).  But what this just shows is that Zen is a very special
<br>
case.  Buddhism, which I specified above, is much broader and is not Zen
<br>
throughout even if Zen interacts with it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; So, I guess, speaking from the Zen Buddhist in me, I reject your
</em><br>
<em> &gt; question as being irrelevant to Zen, and being part of the samsaric
</em><br>
<em> &gt; world.  If you were here I'd just have to hit you with a stick and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; jolt you to enlightenment ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Um, I don't actually think the stick causes enlightenment without a lot
<br>
of advance preparation.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; But just in case *we* happen to be the ones who are in fact
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; horribly, fundamentally wrong, whether or not any current human is
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; right, we need to make sure that the AI is not bound to our
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; mistakes.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This kind of right vs. wrong, dualistic thinking is antithetical to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Zen.
</em><br>
<p>That's okay, it doesn't mean that Zen is antithetical to dualistic thinking.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; And so is the seeking, grasping nature of the whole AGI pursuit.  Zen
</em><br>
<em> &gt; is about being contented with what is, not about constantly striving
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to create a whole new order.  It teaches compassion, but simple
</em><br>
<em> &gt; compassion in each moment, not compassion via building thinking
</em><br>
<em> &gt; machines to change the world. If the Zen Buddhist in me were
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dominant, I wouldn't be working on AGI, I'd be sitting and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; meditating, walking thru the woods, and helping the needy directly.
</em><br>
<p>Why would you change your nature so?  Can you not be content with what
<br>
you are?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt;&gt; The thing is that my wife, a fairly rational person and a
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; Buddhist, would not accept the statement &quot;If you assume that
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; Buddhism is the correct religion, then a Friendly AI would be
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;&gt; Buddhist.&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Sounds like a testable statement.  Would you care to put it to the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; test?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I asked her.  She didn't want to answer ;)
</em><br>
<p>Please tell her I said &quot;Thank you&quot;.  This is a perfectly good answer for 
<br>
my purposes.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Atheism is a conclusion that a mind can be reasonably hoped to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; conclude based on observation of the external world, whereas
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Catholicism is not -- it is something a mind can only be hoped to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; conclude via internal experience, and instruction by others.
</em><br>
<p>Uh... that statement would have gotten you burned at the stake a few
<br>
centuries ago.  *You* may think that Catholicism is a matter of
<br>
unverifiable personal experience, but that is because you are not a
<br>
Catholic.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; So the two cases are very different.  To make a mind that could start
</em><br>
<em> &gt; out Catholic but become atheist, it would suffice to make a mind that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; could revise its own beliefs based on observation.  To make a mind
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that could plausibly start out atheist but become Catholic, one would
</em><br>
<em> &gt; have to guarantee that
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a) the mind were instructed in Catholicism at some point b) the mind
</em><br>
<em> &gt; were built to have similar spiritual experiences to humans
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This asks a lot more.  Atheism is not anthropomorphic or
</em><br>
<em> &gt; human-culture-bound so an AI can naturally be expected to happen upon
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it as a possible attitude. Catholicism is highly anthropomorphic, so
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it would take a lot of work to make a nonhuman system have spiritual
</em><br>
<em> &gt; experiences consistent with the &quot;father son and holy ghost&quot; meme,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>You are making this statement from the viewpoint that Catholicism is
<br>
wrong and that an impartial mind would have to be *forced* into 
<br>
agreement with it.
<br>
<p>A Catholic would have a very different perspective on what was needed
<br>
for an objective observer to come to the correct conclusion that
<br>
Catholicism is the true religion.  For example, a Catholic might deny
<br>
your statement that Catholicism is &quot;anthropomorphic&quot;, saying rather that
<br>
God is the spirit who created all things and that man was created in His
<br>
image, and that in this way both the universe and man reflect God; to
<br>
call God anthropomorphic is blasphemous because it implies that man
<br>
created God rather than the other way around.  Any open mind that comes
<br>
to an apprehension of the universe and the God which is the source of
<br>
that universe would inevitably come to the conclusion that it is
<br>
atheism, not Catholicism, which is a mere construction of man, a device
<br>
of hatred and denial by which the atheists close themselves to the
<br>
immanence of God in their souls and in the world, denying through their
<br>
obstinacy the self-evident truths of the Bible and all the evidence
<br>
therefore, out of pride, for no better reason but to avoid submitting
<br>
themselves to the mercy of their Creator and to avoid obeying those
<br>
commandments that they would be forced to obey if they were to
<br>
acknowledge the Word of the Lord.  For if you were, for even a moment,
<br>
abandon that pride and hubris and hatred that prevent you from seeing
<br>
the truth, you would at once enter into the grace of the Lord, who in
<br>
His mercy provides enough light to each man to illuminate the way,
<br>
though it is your own choice whether to walk it.  Amen.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; I think that asking how to ensure that an AI created by atheists
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; would converge to a religion, given that this religion is correct,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; is a necessary exercise for understanding how an AI can repair
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; whatever deep flaws may very well exist in our own worldviews.  In
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; this sense, I think that refusing to put yourself in the shoes of a
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Christian building an AI and asking what would be &quot;fair&quot; is not
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; just a matter of pre-Singularity politics.  It is a test - and not
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; all that stringent a test, at that - of an AI's ability to
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; transcend the mistakes of its programmers.  If you don't want to
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; apply this test, what are you going to use instead?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it's not impossible that a Novamente could decide the &quot;father, son
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and holy ghost&quot; were the real truth underlying the universe, but it's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; incredibly unlikely since Novababy will have neither father nor
</em><br>
<em> &gt; son... these concepts will not be at all natural to it...
</em><br>
<p>If our universe had been created by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, if
<br>
the Trinity were bound up in the foundations of order for all reality
<br>
and our own world simply a reflection of it, then Novamente would
<br>
indeed, as it grew and came to reflect more and more of the universe and
<br>
to learn more and more of its creators, find these concepts quite
<br>
'natural'.  For Novamente too exists in the world that is sustained by
<br>
the bounty of the Lord.  Do not suppose in your hubris that Novamente
<br>
exists independently of God because you have 'created' it, for the very
<br>
materials of which you fashioned it exist by the will of the Creator and
<br>
would cease in an instant if ever He should withdraw His will.  Amen.
