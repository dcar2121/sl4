About Eugen's suggestion that FAI and SIAI are dangerous...
<br>
<p>It is certainly worth seriously considering such a suggestion.
<br>
<p>But it doesn't take much thought to come to the opposite conclusion.
<br>
<p>In my view, the arguments for FAI and SIAI being dangerous are still highly
<br>
unclear.
<br>
<p>I can understand an argument that *AGI development itself* is dangerous to
<br>
the human race.  It is.
<br>
<p>This was part of Bill Joy's famous Luddite argument.  There are three basic
<br>
counterarguments against it:
<br>
<p>1) the benefits to humans outweigh the risks, probabilistically
<br>
<p>2) the human perspective is narrow, so AGI should be pursued even if it's
<br>
bad for humans
<br>
<p>3) there's no practical way to stop AGI development, so why bother yakking
<br>
about a non-real option
<br>
<p><p>But consider, what happens if Friendly AI thinking and organizing ceases.
<br>
<p>Would this decrease the chance of AGI happening?  Not hardly.  Nearly none
<br>
of the AI work going on today is in any way directly connected to Friendly
<br>
AI.  Although I have little respect for the vast bulk of mainstream AI work,
<br>
nevertheless, I can see that the CS, cognitive science, philosophy of mind
<br>
and neuroscience communities are gradually moving toward a better and better
<br>
understanding of how to build AI.  I don't see the Friendly AI meme as
<br>
contributing substantially to AI development at this moment.  Eliezer is the
<br>
only AI research I know of, for whom Friendly AI is truly central to his AI
<br>
approach.
<br>
<p>Rather, if FAI were to disappear, the inevitable march toward AGI would
<br>
continue... and the odds would be greater still of getting an UNfriendly
<br>
AI....
<br>
<p>So even if you think AGI is a big danger and should be stopped, ask
<br>
yourself: if AGI *isn't* stopped, isn't FAI a good thing to have around, to
<br>
at least minimize the odds of disaster?
<br>
<p>I hasten to add that, personally, I think AGI should be pursued avidly
<br>
[though not recklessly], in spite of the dangers....
<br>
