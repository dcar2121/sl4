From: &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=Re:%20Limits%20and%20Capabilities.">ben@goertzel.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the late 1800's, prior to Planck's experimental work on radiation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior to the discovery of the Michelson-Morley effect, leading physicists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *did* declare that &quot;physics was over, except for putting a few more values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of precision on constants.&quot;  I don't have the quote handy, but there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; famous one from a leading physicist (whom I believe was an administrator
</em><br>
at
<br>
<em>&gt; the university where Michelson made his discoveries).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then, as the turn of the century neared, new experimental discoveries were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made, leading to new theories, and surprising a lot of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not controversial, it's the standard history of physics!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is I think standard history of physics as told by physicists. Historians
<br>
of science will tell you that there was very little agreement in the late
<br>
19th century as to whether physics was more or less over. An interesting
<br>
although (IMO) very uneven book relevant to the subject is John Horgan's
<br>
&quot;The End of Science&quot; (1996).  He's a journalist who went around and asked a
<br>
bunch of big names when or if they thought science would end. I still
<br>
betting on Hawking's 1980 prediction: that a TOE will be discovered by the
<br>
end of the 20th century (sic).:)  Weinberg in a Sci. American article a few
<br>
years back is on record for saying about 2050 for a TOE. My own opinion is
<br>
that the very nature of the scientific enterprise is such that we would
<br>
never be in a position to claim to know that we have reached the &quot;final&quot; TOE
<br>
unless we have first attempted to create superintelligences and
<br>
superscientists.  The reason  I say this is that we have no way of knowing
<br>
whether what we take to be a TOE  really is a TOE or simply the best that
<br>
our puny brains can come up with. In &quot;Dreams of a Final Theory&quot; Weinberg
<br>
toys with the idea that there might be congenital limitations of what humans
<br>
can know: he makes the analogy that we are never going to get dogs to
<br>
calculate atomic energy levels. (His reasons for rejecting the conjecture
<br>
are not worth mentioning).  Of course, the problem is not simply that we can
<br>
get them to give the right answers, it's that we can get our canine friends
<br>
to ask the questions. Similarly, if our TOE answers what looks to us like
<br>
all the relevant questions we still have no guarantee that we have asked all
<br>
the relevant questions. Experimenting to create superintelligences is one
<br>
way to confirm or infirm our best candidates for the TOE. If our TOE really
<br>
is a TOE then even a creature with the brain the size of a football field
<br>
ought not be able to improve on it in any significant manner. In short,
<br>
unless we attempt this experiment we have no way to adjudicate between the
<br>
hypothesis that we have in fact discovered the TOE, and the hypothesis that
<br>
our conjectured TOE merely describes the limits of our minds. (I develop
<br>
this argument in the latter parts of &quot;Naturalism and Skepticism&quot;
<br>
(www.markalanwalker.com/natu.htm I will probably be posting a revised
<br>
version of the paper later tonight. I try not to do HTML work without a beer
<br>
or two in me. :))
