Eli, I think if we were both looking at the same codebase, we'd have no
<br>
substantial disagreements here
<br>
<p>But I am burnt out on this particular argument for the moment!
<br>
<p>Given that all this stuff is bouncing around in my head now, I'll probably
<br>
write a new version of &quot;Thoughts on Ai Morality&quot; later this summer, and you
<br>
can beat the poop out of it then ;)

<em>&gt; &gt; The difference of opinion between us seems to be that I think
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a moderately long phase in which we have an AGI system that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a) has an interesting degree of general intelligence, suitable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experimenting with and learning about AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) has no chance of undergoing a hard takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You and Eliezer seem to assume that as soon as a system has an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at-all-significant degree of general intelligence, it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nontrivial hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; takeoff risk.  As if, say, a &quot;digital dog&quot; is going to solve the hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer/cognitive science problems of optimizing and improving its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sourcecode!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, we think that it is worthwhile to prevent trivial existential risks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think we have confidence about different things.  You and Eli
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more optimism than me that simple hard-takeoff-prevention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, we think that any simple mechanism that has a chance of working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be implemented.  Not a certainty, a chance.  You don't *need* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainty for the mechanism to be a good idea.  All you need is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *chance*.  If there's a *chance* it will work, then you should do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you have a small chance of preventing a small chance of a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disaster, then take it.  It doesn't have to be a large chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preventing a small chance of a very large disaster for us to think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worthwhile.  small * small * very large == worth doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; And I seem to have more confidence than you that there will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; period of infrahuman AGI in which the risk of hard takeoff is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very very very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very low, in which all sorts of things to do with computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hard takeoff prevention, intelligence measurement and AGI in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; studied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben, I also think that there's a period of infrahuman AGI in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of hard takeoff is very very very very low, and in fact, as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall, I don't think the Novamente described in your manuscript will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of doing a hard takeoff, ever.  That's what I *think*.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are always surprises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that you guys don't really accept the diversity of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethical systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that we are thinking about ethics in fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different ways.  The diversity of human ethical systems is simply not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to what I am saying, and the fact that you keep bringing it up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows that I am not getting across.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is not possible to teach Novababy a &quot;universal human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality or ethics&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because no such thing exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not your job or mine to produce such an ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; While I understand the need to temper my natural entrepreneurial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; risk-taking streak in these matters, I think your criticism is a bit too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strong here.  You need to understand that my estimate of the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; existential risk of Novamente having a hard takeoff is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infinitesimally small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So is mine.  But I don't know what surprises are embedded in the space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-modifying algorithms, and we have fundamentally different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pictures of how a hard takeoff works.  I don't know how the dominoes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spaced and I don't know which domino knocks over all the other dominoes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   One innocent-looking algorithm might produce an algorithm that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced an algorithm that produced an algorithm et cetera.  You would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need a map of the entire fitness landscape to actually *know* that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard takeoff wouldn't happen.  I am not saying that Novamente might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knock over much bigger dominoes than you think; I am saying that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominoes might unexpectedly turn out to be all lined up.  Just because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visualize an actual hard takeoff as occurring when an AI learns to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve, using general intelligence, the problem of designing cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems and implementing code for it, does not mean that all hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takeoffs are constrained to occur in this way.
