I'd be willing to bet that the capabilities of the above system could be
<br>
reproduced in an order of magnitude fewer lines of C code if
<br>
re-architected from the ground up. That is a lot of lines of code for
<br>
something that doesn't do that much in an algorithmic sense.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The KB (knowledge base) content can be roughly considered as source code

</em><br>
<p><p>Again, I doubt this is particularly representative of the real problem,
<br>
although I expect the data portion of an AGI will require a lot more
<br>
effort to build than the compilable code.  I don't disagree that a
<br>
really useful system would require millions of raw data nodes.
<br>
<p>For the purposes of AGI at this point, I don't think we are really
<br>
calling this &quot;code&quot;.  People are still working on the compilable
<br>
substrate portion, never mind the data layers. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So I believe that the creation of Seed AI is far beyond the capability of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cycorp.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a flawed belief in that it appears to be based solely on the
<br>
premise of your experience with Cyc. If you don't think the Cyc
<br>
architecture is directly pertinent to AGI (and many don't), then it
<br>
becomes a null data point.
<br>
<p>My personal meaningless guess with respect to the ceiling for the number
<br>
of lines of compiler code required to generate an AGI is about 50,000. 
<br>
Any more than this and you are almost certainly doing things in the
<br>
source code that should be pushed up a layer. Of course, my data point
<br>
is as useful as most everyone else's at this point.
