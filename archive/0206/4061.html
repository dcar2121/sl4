<p><p>Nope.  There are other choices.  Do the Singularity but leave 
<br>
earth alone.  Guard it.  Perhaps police it just enough that some 
<br>
conflict could not kill all.   At the least we would be no worse 
<br>
off and probably better.
<br>
<p>The only way that thre is no way to take full copies of human 
<br>
beings and recreate them is if MNT is also impossible or there 
<br>
really is some immaterial something that just doesn't survive 
<br>
the process.  Otherwise a process can be found and is 
<br>
perfectable enough to work.  If so, then take periodic snapshots 
<br>
of all humans.  If they die and they wish it, then bring them 
<br>
back until they learn better games.
<br>
<p>There is much an SI could do to eradicate disease and much 
<br>
misery.  Just the fact that an SI was possible changes the 
<br>
complexion of human society tremendously.  This change could be 
<br>
molded carefully to produce as much good as possible.
<br>
<p>In short, if you make it a categorical imperative to save and 
<br>
improve the lot of as much of humanity as possible no matter 
<br>
what, we would all feel a lot better about the Work.  It would 
<br>
also, I believe, be much more likely to come to a good end (or 
<br>
beginning) for us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see uploading humans as the goal of the Singularity, though.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see the goal as creating a good successor to humanity; to creating a new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence that is beyond our own.  If we can benefit from that, I say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the better (I wouldn't support Friendly AI if I thought that a good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course of action would be to create an SI with no regard for humans).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I see the goal as, if you will, &quot;a new Heaven and a new Earth&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it as a freeing of sentient life from its constraints 
<br>
and limitations.  If I didn't see it this way I would not be 
<br>
able to continue or participate.  I would not be able to look 
<br>
human beings in the eye and imagine the world without them or 
<br>
the world itself gone and the SI in its place.  It would crush 
<br>
me. I would have no joy in my work, nothing to offer those who 
<br>
dream and have dreamed of better since humanity began.  Call me 
<br>
sentimental if you wish but on this I stand firm.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Funny, though, how the longer one lives the more precious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; life seems to become.  They draft 17 year olds because they'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fearlessly charge machine gun nests.  I myself at 19 thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that the human race would be better off not existing just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because, as you wrote, the &quot;world is full of pain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; suffering&quot;.  (What I failed to see at the time is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it's equally full of joy and gladness, and it's obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; now how evolution had to make it so.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are plenty of good things in life and in humans.  We've done 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of good things.  I hope that we'll go on to do more good things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and transcend into a new level of intelligence.  At the same time, if we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't ever get anywhere, it doesn't matter.  If humans lived in caves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ate bugs and never did anything new ever, the universe would hardly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miss them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>We are what we make of ourselves.  You, small human, wish 
<br>
instead to make something totally different that is better than 
<br>
all of us and makes us irrelevant and unneccessary.  At the 
<br>
least we are the becoming of a SI.  I hope it has the wit to 
<br>
prize that.  I hope we have the wit to understand our 
<br>
interconnection with all It and all sentience and that the 
<br>
disowning of any sentience is the betraying of it in total.
<br>
<p>But it seems to take more than chopping logic to understand this.
