<p>Always, never.  Sometimes, yes.  Exactly?  I doubt anyone ever knows 
<br>
EXACTLY what someone else knows/believes/intends, but it is possible to be 
<br>
in synch it to a very large degree.  But for complex issues it is 
<br>
difficult, takes much time, the participants generally must know each other 
<br>
well, and it still frequently fails to fully synchronize the participants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The life experiences gained by marriage can be complex and useful and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotionally significant... but they come at a cost: you miss-out on other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiences that are not marriage or marriage-related.  In your above quoted
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;married people have that is unavailable to unmarried people: that of knowing
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;introspection and completion-of-effort.  Marriage is not a prerequisite for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Naw, I was just using marriage as an example because, in theory, married 
<br>
couples are about as close and intertwined as it gets.  Thus, they should 
<br>
be a good reference point on how much people can potentially understand 
<br>
each other.  And frequently they don't.
<br>
<p>I'd love to hear your theory on why marriage &quot;often hinders&quot; knowledge of 
<br>
intentions.
