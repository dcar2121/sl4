hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Einstein had been an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary genius,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he would have invented Special Relativity on the basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michaelson-Morley,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not gone on to invent General Relativity on the basis of essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *no* evidence.
</em><br>
<p>GR was a great invention, but very similar to observations Hilbert made at
<br>
about the same time, and closely related to prior conjectures by Riemann.
<br>
It's not as though Einstein's genius pulled it out of thin air...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Almost as astonishing as Einstein's invention of General
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Relativity is his (absolutely correct) advance confidence in it: on being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked what he would have done if the eclipse observations conflicted with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; General Relativity, Einstein is said to have replied:  &quot;Then I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pitied the Good Lord.  The theory is correct.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now of course it could be that Einstein was just overconfident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be right (though this also happened with Special Relativity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kauffman's apparent disconfirmation), but it's even more unnerving to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contemplate whether Einstein's confidence might have been *actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified*.
</em><br>
<p>I very strongly suspect Einstein was just overconfident.  He was equally
<br>
confident in the wrongness of quantum theory, and so far has not been at all
<br>
validated in that regard.  (He spent the last decades of his life chasing
<br>
wild geese related to his wrong intuitions on quantum theory.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   What if Einstein's assigned confidence level was as correct as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his theory?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   It implies that Einstein didn't have *just enough* intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to invent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; General Relativity; it implies that Einstein had enough intelligence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invent General Relativity and *know* it was correct.  How did he possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know?  For that matter, how did he invent the theory in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place?  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to me that in some way, Einstein learned to think like the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well enough to anticipate, in advance of knowing, what kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe would invent.
</em><br>
<p>Einstein had a great physical intuition, to be sure.
<br>
<p>But the idea that physical laws could act by curving space was previously
<br>
articulated by Riemann.
<br>
<p>Once Minkowski introduced the idea of &quot;spacetime&quot; as an entity, the natural
<br>
extension of Riemann's ideas is to think about curved spacetime
<br>
<p>This is why Hilbert as well as Einstein was led to formulating physical laws
<br>
in terms of curved spacetime.  Einstein pushed it a little further than
<br>
Hilbert, of course... probably because he was pushed by physical intuition
<br>
more than purely mathematical intuition as in Hilbert's case
<br>
<p>I don't think there's any kind of mysterious &quot;knowledge&quot; going on here....
<br>
Einstein may have had the *feeling* that he had some kind of mystical
<br>
intuition into God's ways, but this was just a human feeling...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That's the power of intelligence.  It's quite fashionable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deemphasize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power of individual intelligence in favor of social intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Fashionable, but wrong.  Nature is not that fair or democratic.
</em><br>
<p>I am not denying that some people are vastly smarter than others.  Of course
<br>
they are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; intelligence is still far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrated in a single individual.
</em><br>
<p>I'm having trouble attaching a meaning to this statement.  How does one
<br>
define a disembodied lump of intelligence and then considering distributing
<br>
it either to one individual or among several?
<br>
<p>Of course, human individual intelligence and human collective intelligence
<br>
have very different characteristics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Computer science in general seems to have benefited from collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence at least as much as from &quot;lone genius&quot; style intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Progress in CS has been as substantial as that in physics, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; CS heros on the order of Einstein or Newton to look up to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't describe AI as a CS problem.
</em><br>
<p>No, of course AI isn't strictly speaking a CS problem, it's an integrative
<br>
multidisciplinary problem.
