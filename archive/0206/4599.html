<p>
hi,
<br>
<p>I called up an acquaintance who is a devout Christian and asked him to
<br>
comment on the Singularity, AGI and related things...
<br>
<p>I asked him &quot;do you think an AGI, if smart enough and unbiased, would arrive
<br>
at the truth of the Christian religion generally, or of your branch of
<br>
christianity (catholicism) specifically?&quot;
<br>
<p>A brief summary of some of the points [translated into Ben-speak] that came
<br>
up are:
<br>
<p>1) he said it was a really deep and tough question that he wasn't sure he
<br>
knew enough to answer reasonably
<br>
<p>2) he pointed out that intelligence is not the same as wisdom or spiritual
<br>
insight, and he was skeptical that an AGI was going to have wisdom or
<br>
spiritual insight.  Seeing the truth of Catholicism is in his view more to
<br>
do with wisdom than with intelligence, as evidenced by the fact that some
<br>
really smart people aren't Catholics...
<br>
<p>3) the big question is whether the posited AGI will have a soul.  If it
<br>
doesn't have a soul, it will not see the truth of Christianity at all, it
<br>
will be impaired in this way.  Whether the AGI will have a soul is up to
<br>
God, not us, and it's pretty hard to guess what god's will is gonna be in
<br>
this situation
<br>
<p>4) he thought wisdom had a lot to do with the body as well as the mind, and
<br>
was skeptical of the wisdom of a bodiless being
<br>
<p>5) he didn't see his religious faith as coming out of any kind of
<br>
&quot;correspondence theory&quot; [which doesn't mean that it doesn't, it just means
<br>
he didn't see it that way]
<br>
