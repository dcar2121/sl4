</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If it is really ethical it will not follow any offensive

military orders.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The Singularity is directly opposed to the national interests of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;particular national government, because it will almost inevitably lead to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;revolution&quot; that will make national boundaries meaningless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well for me the Singularity is something that I cannot see beyond, so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will respond to your statement as though I agree with the premise and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offer this counterexample of the second statement in your argument:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recent history shows that national governments will surrender sovereignty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a greater good.  Witness the EU and NAFTA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>NAFTA has not been for the greater good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Thus, no government should be trusted to play a leading role in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not only do I have the opposite opinion, I believe that as the evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mounts that an AGI is possible, the government - and in particular the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government will take the leading role.  I believe this from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the dynamics of how our government institutions have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responded to the great technical challenges over my lifetime -  The Space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Race, the War On Cancer, Safe Cars, Solar Energy, The AIDS Epidemic ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not see any non-governmental organization as the front-runner.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual work of developing and educating the Seed AI would in my opinion be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performed by private contracting companies - somewhat in competition with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The Space Race that we used as a political football and then let 
<br>
fall completely flat; the War on Cancer that was largely a lie 
<br>
(see The Big Lie); Safe Cars (?) with 50,000 Americans dying on 
<br>
the highway each year; Aids - see Bush's latest non-action 
<br>
proposals.  Clearly there is no clear pattern of government 
<br>
doing great things in real problems/opportunities.  Quite the 
<br>
opposite is the case.  And don't let us forget the US has more 
<br>
of its population in jail than any other country, most for 
<br>
victimless &quot;crimes&quot;.  Don't forget we are claiming an endless 
<br>
War without clear objectives against any country that we feel is 
<br>
not sufficiently for our obviously Good and Righteous War. No, I 
<br>
don't think the US government has any clear demonstrated ability 
<br>
to do anything except spend us into oblivion and wreck a lot of 
<br>
other coutnries for the sake of monied interests.
<br>
<p>Oh goodie, a major military spending boondoggle to develop Seed 
<br>
AI and teach it to follow orders!  The only virtue with such a 
<br>
proposal is if you don't want to see AGI really developed within 
<br>
the next 100 years.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I might accept gov't funding for AGI research, but I would never willingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;place control of an AGI in the hands of any military organization.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;really scares me.  Those people are not Singularity-savvy, and I don't trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they will become so in the future, not in any healthy way.  Plus, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;interests are not those of the human race as a whole, let alone of sentience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as a whole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My belief that the funding will be from the defense budget stems from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion that an AGI would be priceless for our nation's defense, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing this the military will fund before other government institutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It does not belong to &quot;our nation&quot; or any nation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Overall I believe that our constitutional, representative government has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best chance of marshaling citizen support and addressing the reasoned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissent sure to come in the face of mounting evidence that an AGI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.  Regardless of popular opinion towards the government, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculate that all other alternative coordinating organizations would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judged inferior by the public.
</em><br>
<p><p>It is a pity we in the US no longer in reality practice 
<br>
constitutional, representative government.  By the time the 
<br>
&quot;public&quot; gets around to &quot;judging&quot; it will be far too late.
