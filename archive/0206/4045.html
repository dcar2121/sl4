<p>Anand,
<br>
<p>When I read the sections (CFAI: 3.4.2.4.3 and 3.4.4) I considered the whole
<br>
concept of a 'cloud of attributes' for humanity to be a fascinating thought
<br>
experiment, something which might facilitate discussion.  When I read the
<br>
suggestion that there would be a strong superposed build-up around
<br>
'altruism', I found the idea intriguing... but hardly convincing, as it was
<br>
just an idea within a thought experiment.  If indeed there is actual
<br>
&quot;evidence&quot; to support this idea, I too want to see it.  Thinking further...
<br>
<p>How would one obtain such evidence?  Through analysis of what people *do*
<br>
perhaps?  Wouldn't you also need to know the reasoning behind thier actions?
<br>
That would involve asking them questions.  How would we judge who was lying,
<br>
or even that they understood the questions?
<br>
<p>IMO, there is unlikely to be any conclusive evidence (of convergence to a
<br>
central definition of 'altruism') until after uploading, and a direct,
<br>
impartial analysis can be made against a population of humans who's wetware
<br>
brains have been accurately simulated in software.  It will be a great time
<br>
to be a cognitive psychologist  :)
<br>
<p>But by all means, if someone has real-world evidence of this convergence
<br>
now... bring it forward.
<br>
