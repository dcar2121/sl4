<p>Does this indicate that there will be no fail safe system in place until

after your AGI system has been conscious and running for awhile?

</em><br>
<p>And, as someone pointed out, more than just &quot;Singularity wizards&quot; should be 
<br>
consulted.  I'm not suggesting you invite the Pope or President Bush, but a 
<br>
somewhat broader group should be used.

</em><br>
<p>Your quote from your AI Morality essay (as used by Brian):
<br>
<p>&quot;But intuitively, I feel that an AGI with these values is going to be a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;positive force in the universe ­ where by “positive” I mean “in accordance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with Ben Goertzel’s value system”.&quot; - Ben's idea of how an AI figures out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what's &quot;right&quot;
<br>
<p>I think this point is in fact 100% dead on.  All it says is if the AGI 
<br>
successfully learns and uses the same values as Ben Goertzel then they AGI 
<br>
would be a positive force in the universe according to Ben Goertzel's 
<br>
viewpoint.  How could that statement be anything other than correct?
<br>
<p>However, there is a significant difference between being technically 
<br>
correct and having the most appropriate or wise solution.  Ben's statement 
<br>
is technically correct, yet it is quite possible that many people who are 
<br>
not Ben Goertzel would not like the outcome.
<br>
<p>This is where wisdom comes into play and I, personally, think Ben gets it 
<br>
and Eliezer does not.  But I'm perfectly open to thinking that they both 
<br>
get it, neither gets it or that I've got it backwards; if someone can 
<br>
present substantial reason.
