Hi Even.  I haven't posted in a LONG time, but I had a few comments...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, apart from the singularity (which was a new idea to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me recently), I've always been convinced that humanity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; die unless we manage to get away from this planet and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; colonize other planets.  If not because there is a high risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of putting ALL our genes (and everything we every accomplished)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on one planet together with atom bombs and polution, or because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; soon we'll run out of materials, energy and destroy our environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behond the point where we can survive, then because the sun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will burn up (or explode) in the end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's several billion years from now, and I think we'll be able to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that, or be long gone before then.  The rest of this is just bogus.
</em><br>
<p>The sun is almost certainly irrelevant, yes.  However, to say that 
<br>
everything else &quot;is just bogus&quot; is not a fair (much less nice) 
<br>
statement.  &quot;Putting ALL our genes ... on one planet&quot; is very risky.  There 
<br>
are real dangers that could potentially cause major harm, or annihilate, 
<br>
the human race.  A few obvious examples would be nuclear holocaust, 
<br>
bio-weapons, killer asteroids, etc.  All of these are completely 
<br>
plausible.  Nano-Technology, once developed, will add even more 
<br>
possibilities.  It makes me nervous having the survival of Humanity tied to 
<br>
the Earth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you look at the way the whole industry has evolved till now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then it isn't reasonable to expect we will change anything until it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is too late (poisoned atmosphere, more humans then the earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and feed and a civilisation that is fragile and will break
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down totally when we don't even get MORE people, MORE pollution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and MORE raw materials; which is impossible at some point).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The atmosphere is a lot cleaner now than it was even 20, let alone 50 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago.  The population in the developed world is already below replacement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level, and the rest of the world is showing signs of leveling off as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As I said, bogus.
</em><br>
<p>Environmental problems are the least of our worries and very unlikely to 
<br>
wipe out humanity.  We don't even know for certain if we're causing global 
<br>
warming or if it is a natural long-term trend causing it.  Heck, have we 
<br>
even proved global warning is happening (haven't bothered keeping up to 
<br>
date on that sort of stuff).  However, population growth does have a 
<br>
reasonable chance of outstripping food (and other required supplies) within 
<br>
decades.  That could cause major problems if we don't find a way to stop or 
<br>
deal with it (singularity, possibly nano-tech, space colonization, etc).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Whether you like it or not, the progress that humanity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; making (and is needed for the Singularity), like the computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; market (and needed research fundings) and internet is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to fall down when America, or Europe or Japan etc turns into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an area like Libanon or Irak.  Humanity is constantly on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; edge of Not Making It.  Perhaps there will not be total self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destruction, but surely we won't get another chance to colonize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other planets, or initiate the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;U.s. turning into something like Lebanon or Iraq?  Where's your evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this nutty statement?  Yes, nutty.  I stand by my description.
</em><br>
<p>Unless one or more catastrophic events occur it is unlikely this will occur 
<br>
within the next few decades.  I actually find it very unlikely that the 
<br>
United States could backslide that much given virtually any amount of time, 
<br>
barring extraordinary circumstances (catastrophic events).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Intelligent people realize this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You mean that anyone who doesn't see things the way you do isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent?
</em><br>
<p>The way it looks to me is that your both playing that game.  Both of you 
<br>
have valid and plausible points, so play nice.  ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Some react with depression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some react by starting to party and drink alcohol.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some react by putting all their energy into initiating the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I never said, nor would I say, that people should not invest their energies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in advancing the singularity.  (Although I don't think it will really affect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the arrival date one iota.)  I was simply asking Eliezer why he thought so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much effort was necessary to advance something that is already advancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quite rapidly, and why he seemed to think humanity was toast if it didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;come off.
</em><br>
<p>If a large group of highly talented scientists, engineers, etc. were to 
<br>
start contributing much of their effort towards the Singularity I don't see 
<br>
how it wouldn't effect the arrival date.  Well, unless there really is such 
<br>
thing as pre destiny and the Singularity has a fixed arrival date.  But 
<br>
that's about as unlikely as it gets, in my opinion (I don't believe in 
<br>
astrology either).
<br>
<p>The reason why Eliezer believes so much effort is required is because he'd 
<br>
like to see it happen tomorrow instead of in ~2021.  It remains to be seen 
<br>
if he will actually have much effect on the end result, but at least he is 
<br>
trying.
<br>
<p>I also think &quot;humanity is toast if it [doesn't] come off&quot;, btw.  Well, 
<br>
unless galactic colonization becomes readily available in the not so 
<br>
distant future.  Given just the many, many ways we can easily annihilate 
<br>
ourselves (skipping natural catastrophes for the moment), which is 
<br>
constantly growing, eventually something or someone will give and there 
<br>
will be major destruction.  Espicially as it becomes easier and easier to 
<br>
acquire devastating technology.  If we can't solve the problem by the time 
<br>
teenagers can build weapons of mass destruction (whether nano, nuclear or 
<br>
bio is irrelevant) I'd say we are definitely doomed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Buy us some time Evan and use some Love and Understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in your life - that way the next World War might be delayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think I might have more 'love and understanding' than you have, because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think better of humans in general than you seem to.  I'm not expecting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;next&quot; world war.  I do not believe we are always on the verge of not making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it, or at the edge of a precipice, or any other doom clichae - eve of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destruction, gotta get that one in.  I recognize problems, but my outlook
</em><br>
<em>&gt;isn't the bleak one you seem to have.  If I was really that down on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future, I would have packed it in decades ago.  Fortunately, I and others -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though I admit we're an unfashionable minority - are a little more hopeful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about the human and transhuman future.
</em><br>
<p>I think you could both show a little more tolerance, if not &quot;love and 
<br>
understanding&quot; towards each other's opinions.  After all, they are ALL just 
<br>
opinions!
