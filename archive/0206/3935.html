<p>
Ben &amp; Eleizer,
<br>
<p>This thread is most certainly pertinent. 
<br>
<p>I worry about a distrubing trend among furturists
<br>
(Transhuamnists included) to write-off discussions of
<br>
political, economic, and epistemological philosophy as
<br>
a waste of time or off-topic. They may already be
<br>
living somewhere past the Singularity in their minds
<br>
and have forgotten that the present serves as the
<br>
foundation to realize their visions. Disengaging in
<br>
favor of purely technological activity or, even worse,
<br>
purely passive imaginings is impractical. 
<br>
<p>To the contrary, major change has always been heralded
<br>
in by one &quot;ism&quot; or another. As much as new ways of
<br>
thinking or perceiving (or projecting for that matter)
<br>
the world is a response to major social change, they
<br>
also serve as an integration mechanism. Whether
<br>
expressed as art, myth, literature, or philosophy
<br>
these both prepare the affected culture for the impact
<br>
of change, and create a mindset which furthers the
<br>
transformation of society. 
<br>
<p>You mentioned Existentialism and Post-Modernism which
<br>
arose, respectively, in response to the atheism of
<br>
enlightened rational thought (not to mention
<br>
industrial rev / WWII) and Cold War certainties &amp; new
<br>
physics (Theory of Relativity &amp; Uncertainty Pncpl
<br>
among them). This sounds myopic, but in the interest
<br>
of time and a lot of space that could be wasted, you
<br>
see the point I'm making...
<br>
<p>In any case, a certain zeitgeist has implications
<br>
which crosses disciplines.
<br>
<p>Transhumanists, and anyone who envisions a
<br>
singularity, will ignore your recent posts at their
<br>
own peril. The research you are both conducting,
<br>
assuming that it is as important as I believe it is,
<br>
must necessarily have a dramatic impact on philosphy -
<br>
not simply in order to get There, but how we will
<br>
interact with the world once we are.
<br>
<p>How do we get from Plato, to Kant, to Hegel, to De
<br>
Sartre (I'll take the opportunity to throw in
<br>
Heidegger), past Focault and to... To What?

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And how does faith help in the slightest?
</em><br>

</em><br>
