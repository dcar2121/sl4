<em>&gt; Hey Ben,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does that include genetic programming?
</em><br>
<p>Evolutionary programming (in a particular form) is one of the key learning
<br>
heuristics of my Novamente AI architecture
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, as is currently becomming pretty vogue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing the program to write itself might be a faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach, even though it seems 'inefficient' due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its randomness.
</em><br>
<p>Novamente, once it gets smart enough, will be able to handle the task of
<br>
re-coding itself.
<br>
<p>But I think that we need to start off an AGI with some pretty good AI data
<br>
structures and algorithms, which it can then use to think about re-coding
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>In my view, evolving an intelligently-goal-directed-self-modification system
<br>
from scratch is a cool idea, but is more an &quot;origin of life&quot; project than an
<br>
AGI project per se.  Also a cool project but, in my view, much more
<br>
resource-intensive.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;From my perspective, a new approach to this method
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could make real headway with relatively few lines of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code, many versions, access to a simple command
</em><br>
<em>&gt; library, and a whole lot of computing power. And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't mean rewriting the entire program, or gen 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redesigning itself from some grand plan. Just simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes, line by line, over time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you aware of anyone working in this direction?
</em><br>
<p>Writing simple code that self-modifies itself is no big trick, but also not
<br>
very useful.  See many references in the domain of &quot;artificial chemistry,&quot;
<br>
e.g. some older work by Walter Fontana (Alchemy? was that the name of his
<br>
system? I'm not sure...)
<br>
<p>I think that starting with fixed-program intelligence, and getting one's
<br>
fixed-program intelligence to intelligently self-modify, will be an easier
<br>
route than starting with unintelligent self-modification and getting it to
<br>
be intelligent....
<br>
<p>But I could be wrong, of course -- neither approach has been made to work,
<br>
so far!!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Re: Aaron's &quot;mid-night hackers&quot;. I think that he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, especially in light of grid computing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computing power may be a stumbling block not for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sake of the AI itself, but because GP requires so darn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many evolving programs to get any results in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable amount of time. The SETI software, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not truly advanced grid, is a glimpse of how this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff will become accessable to all of us soon.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, globally distributed computing will be very useful for AGI, once we
<br>
have built software that can utilize it in an appropriate way.
<br>
<p>I have detailed designs for using globally distributed Net computing to
<br>
enhance AGI, but these are on the back burner until my core AGI is more
<br>
fully built.
<br>
