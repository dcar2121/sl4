Who will launch the Singularity?
<br>
Rafal,
<br>
<p>History shows that throwing money at a problem is not always the best way to
<br>
solve it!
<br>
<p>This is why these days, major software firms tend to effectively outsource
<br>
most of their software R&amp;D to startups -- acquiring those startups that have
<br>
produced something clearly valuable.
<br>
<p>There is a lot of power in a small, tightly-knit team that has deep common
<br>
understanding.  Especially in the domain of software.  (And yes, I
<br>
understand that AGI is not just a software problem, but still, much of the
<br>
practical work of making an AGI is software work.)   Large companies and
<br>
government labs have a lot of trouble replicating the innovation that the
<br>
best independently-working small teams produce.
<br>
<p>I think that when gov't or major companies get into the AGI game, it may
<br>
well be by
<br>
<p>-- funding academic research groups, or
<br>
-- acquiring stakes in, or fully acquiring, small firms doing innovative
<br>
research

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only do I have the opposite opinion, I believe that as the evidence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mounts that an AGI is possible, the government - and in particular the US
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;government will take the leading role.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;### I guess that Stephen is right - the US government will be able to run
<br>
circles around indepdendent SAI efforts in the rase to the Singularity, by
<br>
virtue of the massive financial and organizational resources it will throw
<br>
at it (shortly before SAI becomes feasible based on academic efforts),
<br>
although a big software company might be the dark horse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that the Friendliness learning process forces a single
<br>
ethical structure as the outcome, predicated on the external referents of
<br>
Friendliness, the panhuman layer. However, there might be local minima
<br>
surrounding this part of the &quot;ethical configuration space&quot;, and an AI might
<br>
be launched towards one of them. Hopefully, not the one requiring a pledge
<br>
of allegiance.
