At 11:21 AM 6/23/2002 +0200, Eugen Leiti:
<br>
<em>&gt;Somewhen within the next decades, probably less than a century, a team
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will build an intelligent seed that enters a positive autofeedback loop,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by design.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is a considerable gap between what a given assembly of (molecular)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;switches could do in principle, and what humans can make it do. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superhuman AI does not have this limitation, or at least not for long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This stage of enhancement can buy you a couple orders of magnitude on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same hardware base. Considerably more, if this is reconfigurable logic, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to be expected at the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Given the state of system security, the global network is sitting there on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a silver platter, ready to be picked up. Here's your potential to expand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your hardware base by eight to nine orders of magnitude within minutes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hours, without even trying. Instead of a single AI everyone for some
</em><br>
<p>Well, we would hope that the team who created this AI doesn't give it 
<br>
access to the global network!  Or, if it does, it would be so highly 
<br>
restrictive as to (at least for the near term, pre-super intelligence) 
<br>
prevent such uncontrolled expansion.  However, they could conceivably be 
<br>
ignorant enough to grant such access or have a flaw in their security.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;strange reason assumes to be a given we're suddenly facing a population of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realtime AIs well in excess of humanity's population. Due to
</em><br>
<p>Or one very massive AI.  I'd probably bet on a single, world-spanning AI 
<br>
rather than it spawning billions of small AIs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;co-evolutionary competition and population pressure the AIs will very soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;start designing and building new hardware, which allows them to become
</em><br>
<p>And just how would they make the leap from running on silicon to building 
<br>
silicon?  I'm almost certain that there is no capacity to do this 
<br>
today.  They would have to be able to perform 100% of the manufacturing and 
<br>
assembly operation completely via computer, assemble the working technology 
<br>
and connect it to the net.  All without human intervention.  Even if there 
<br>
was a facility which had all of this capability computer controlled (which 
<br>
I don't believe is the case, much of it is manual - moving pieces between 
<br>
manufacturing workstations, etc) the operators would have to sit there 
<br>
while the machines spent hours (days?) &quot;doing their own thing&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;significantly superrealtime, about six orders of magnitude faster than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before (~1 day : 3000 years). This would give them the edge over other AIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which chose not to, or were too slow. At this stage fabbing of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hardware (habitats, sensors, actuators, infrastructure) becomes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bottleneck, and pressure to expand it becomes ferocious, as is competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for new resources.
</em><br>
<p>Once the genie is out of the bottle (super-human AI having self-controlled, 
<br>
beginning to end, automated manufacturing), yes.  But that is quite a leap 
<br>
from Seed or Human-Equivelant AI, unless it is helped by the humans (given 
<br>
access to the net and assistance in manufacturing).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I could describe a few things which could happen at the physical layer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within the course of days to weeks to illustrate above pretty abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt;description (all organic material done, darkness, large structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everywhere, frantic activity at all scales on the ground and in the air,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much too quick for human eye to see), but clearly we're completely out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our depth here. Even if no new physics is involved, which it very well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;At this stage humanity needs active protection in order to survive. Mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indifference doesn't cut the mustard.
</em><br>
<p>agreed
