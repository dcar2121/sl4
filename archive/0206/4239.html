</em><br>
<p>I've thought about this a lot in the domain of math &amp; programming.  I think
<br>
we can go a long way by collaboratively solving small math and programming
<br>
problems with it, so it can pick up patterns in what we're doing in various
<br>
cases and generalize from what it sees....  This is actually how most people
<br>
work with automated theorem proving tools right now... interactively,
<br>
guiding the system when it gets stuck.  But, current automated theorem
<br>
provers don't significantly learn inductively from the guidance they get ;-(
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes programming or teaching...
</em><br>
<p>You raise a very good point.
<br>
<p>A lot of thought has gone into the question: Do we need to program
<br>
high-level cognitive schema into Novamente?
<br>
<p>I have gone back and forth on this, actually.  You may well be right...
<br>
though my current brain-state hopes not ;&gt;
<br>
<p>The way to do that in Novamente, technically, would be to create compound
<br>
schema embodying &quot;ways of organizing ideas and approaching problems.&quot;  For
<br>
this purpose one would want to actually implement the Sasha
<br>
Novamente-scripting language we've designed, or something like it.  The ways
<br>
of organizing and approaching are then Sasha programs loaded into the
<br>
mind...
<br>
<p>My hope is that the Sasha scripts we end up needing to write will be more in
<br>
the spirit of &quot;nudging the system into context-appropriate emergent
<br>
responses&quot; rather than say, &quot;encoding explicit inference control schemes.&quot;
<br>
But I look forward to getting to the stage where we can discover such things
<br>
empirically!
<br>
<p>In the context of language processing, for instance, I created a whole bunch
<br>
of such &quot;schema-scripts&quot; for things like word-sense disambiguation, parsing,
<br>
etc.  But I'd rather not have to use them....  So we'll see!
<br>
<p>The Novamente architecture is really flexible, which is because I know
<br>
there's a lot left to discover, and I'd like to be able to incorporate what
<br>
we learn along the way without scrapping the system and starting over
<br>
(though I won't be surprised if a total code rewrite is needed before we get
<br>
to human-level AI, I'm still hoping ... ;)
