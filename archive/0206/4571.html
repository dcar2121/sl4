<p><em>&gt; But I am not sure how easy it will be to define a generic transhumanist

<em>&gt; ethics, either.  For instance, we have seen that among the different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists on this list, there are very different attitudes toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare.  My strong preference is to have the AGI believe killing is wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in almost all circumstances.  Evidently some transhumanists disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should I then refrain from teaching the AGI that killing is wrong in almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all circumstances, because by doing so, I am teaching it Ben Goertzel ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of genetic transhumanist ethics?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure it's possible to teach a system ethics as a set of abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles, only.  Maybe  most of the teaching has to be teaching by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.  And if it is teaching by example, there's going to be a fair bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of individual bias in the selection of examples....
</em><br>
<p>I put out on this list some time ago (or on Extropians) what
<br>
has to be a very old idea to you folks:  what about first 
<br>
getting the program to the point that it appears to be able
<br>
to understand literature, and then having it come to its
<br>
own conclusions after having read 200,000 books and plays
<br>
from every culture that touch on issues of morality?  I
<br>
would think that if the machine is able to hold decent
<br>
conversations with us at that point, that it will have
<br>
become a veritable fountainhead of knowledge about what
<br>
is and isn't moral.
<br>
<p>So I agree with you about the unlikeliness of teaching ethics
<br>
solely as a set of abstract principles (though I have not
<br>
studied Eliezer's proposals), but the suggestion of having
<br>
the AI read everything overcomes your point about bias.
