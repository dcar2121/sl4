<em>&gt; hi brian,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; See Eugen this is one of the major complaints people around these parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably have regarding your ideas. They are based on things you wish for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but don't seem to really exist or work in reality. I know you WISH we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had working cryonics, perfect anti-aging and disease prevention tech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone had their own mini space colony, but none of this seems likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to happen any time soon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But brian, it is certainly plausible to say anti-aging drugs and cryonics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will work some time soon -- just as plausible as to say this about AI.
</em><br>
<p>It is somewhat plausible, but remember the original point we were discussing:
<br>
the 150k deaths/day issue. Eugen posits that his proposal for how to
<br>
proceed to the future is not so bad because we'll eventually get good
<br>
enough cryonics and other anti-death tech that the 150k deaths/day issue
<br>
goes away. My take is that while maybe one or two issues like maybe some
<br>
specific cancers or some forms of aging or even maybe some cryonics
<br>
improvements might come before 2010, the odds of getting ALL cryonics and
<br>
aging and disease problems solved by then /for the entire planetary
<br>
population/ are greatly worse than the odds of achieving a self improving
<br>
AI by then. My take on these odds also stays the same all the way out to
<br>
2050 by which point AI is a virtual certainty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I happen to think that real AI can happen a lot faster than truly effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-aging drugs.  But these are for intuitive rather than rigorous reasons.
</em><br>
<p>I can think of many quite rigorous reasons why his wishes are unlikely to
<br>
happen very soon. For starters no one has truly figured out all the facets
<br>
of aging or disease. 2nd, once they do they still have to develop drugs or
<br>
other techniques to solve the problems. 3rd they have to get this approved
<br>
by the FDA. 4th they have to then somehow make these technologies available
<br>
to everyone on the planet. Good luck getting all that done by 2020.
<br>
<p>(snipped Ben's agreement that aging is a hard problem to crack soon)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think cryonics could probably be mastered fairly quickly if a lot of $$
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were put into it.  the remaining problems have to do with things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;inventing a very fast way of heating up tissue&quot; and &quot;creating drugs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counteract the toxic effects of cryoprotectants,&quot; which intrinsically seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like easier problems than those of AI or truly effectiveanti-aging.
</em><br>
<p>Even if you master cryonics you still have the problems of brain damage
<br>
in a large percentage of humans as they age + making it affordable for
<br>
everyone on the planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, I don't think Eugen is guilty of wishful thinking regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics, space travel or anti-aging, any more than Eli and you and I are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilty of wishful thinking regarding AI!!
</em><br>
<p>Oh come on and take a stand :-) If you were betting money you would bet
<br>
on AI before perfect anti-aging/anti-disease/cryonics + personal spacecraft
<br>
right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Meanwhile, rather than admit that there just might be a /possibility/ of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fixing all this via an AI technology that can be built and tested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a way as to be likely less risky than letting human uploads run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wild, you aren't interested in even seriously investigating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have thought about this very seriously and I think that superhuman AI is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MORE risky path than human uploads.  There are a lot more unknowns with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhuman AI; we are dealing with a different sort of embodiment AND a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different sort of mind all at once.
</em><br>
<p>A human upload that modifies its mind into transhumanity has both the same
<br>
problems.
