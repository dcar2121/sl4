<p>I think it is not so astonishing: the special relativity raised a more 
<br>
important question than it solved: why can it
<br>
work together with the gravity. I think this is only natural that one 
<br>
tries hard to tackle this question, and he had
<br>
the most motivation to do is, because his theory was at the stake. That 
<br>
was the reason also that he tried so hard
<br>
to prove that quantum-mechanics was not correct.

<br>
<p>It seems that he did not menage &quot;thinking like the universe&quot;, otherwise 
<br>
he would have discovered the quantum-mechanics
<br>
instead of insisting that it was not correct.
<br>
<p>I believe that Einstein was a great genius, and that he was at the right 
<br>
place at the right time (the special relativity is
<br>
so simple that it would have been surely discovered by someone else.), 
<br>
but I don't think the consistantly trying to tackle
<br>
the most insteresting problem was an inherent attribute of him. I think 
<br>
there is more coincidence, than you trying to
<br>
suggest.
