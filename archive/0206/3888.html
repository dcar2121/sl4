<p>Okay, I guess I failed to communicate that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It almost seems that what you're calling &quot;rationalization&quot; is what

</em><br>
<em>&gt; call &quot;abduction&quot; or &quot;hypothesis&quot; -- one of the most important forms of

</em><br>
<p>I was worried when I was writing this that it might sound like that.  
<br>
Guess I was right.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that rationalization is, specifically, a *control mechanism for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference* that *specifically seeks to consider only evidence in favor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth of a certain proposition, rather than evidence against its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not specifically tied to abduction, deduction, or any specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mode of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning, in my view.  One can rationalize with pure deduction if one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wishes.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it's harder to rationalize deduction.  It's very easy to 
<br>
rationalize abduction.  That's why my example went the way it did 
<br>
(looking back at what I wrote, I didn't really get out of example mode 
<br>
when I started to explain rationalization, sorry).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I think that *rationalization itself* is a powerful heuristic for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, really great creative thinkers may proceed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) rationalizing their way to an interesting conclusion, by careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference control
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) then, AFTERWARDS, considering their conclusion in a more balanced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at both positive and negative evidence equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, I think that rationalization is an important part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative thought process, but it is dangerous if used alone, rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one stage in a multi-stage process
</em><br>
<p>I think there's a difference between rationalization and *choosing* to 
<br>
ignore some facts so that you can get a conclusion that you can then go 
<br>
back and play with.  For example, when programming, it's common to start 
<br>
working on a program by assuming that the input is always in a specific 
<br>
format and fits certain guidelines.  Then, once you have the basic 
<br>
algorithm working, you go back and generalize your algorithm to work 
<br>
with more general input.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; When you are trying to find a reason why your conclusion is true, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; being to feel like you are straining to come up with support.  Stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right there.  If you don't know, you don't know, so don't make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; up, because whatever you make up is not helpful and will confuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; matters, an irrational choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, making stuff up is great.  The important thing is to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards, judge what you've made up by a harsher criterion (a fuller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration of evidence).
</em><br>
<p>This is true.  My main objective in this example was to point out that 
<br>
you have to acknowledge that you don't know and realize the consequences 
<br>
of making things up.  I generalized too much, so here's the situation I 
<br>
was thinking about when I wrote this:
<br>
<p>You are explaining to your friend why you think that theory x is true.  
<br>
In doing so he asks a question that you realize that you don't know the 
<br>
answer to.  Rather than admit that you don't know, you make up some 
<br>
excuse on the spot that probably doesn't really hold up, but, as you see 
<br>
it, keeps the argument going.
<br>
<p>Of course, later on you should sit down and try to figure out what an 
<br>
answer might be to his question.  Maybe it turns out he found the error 
<br>
in theory x.  Maybe you'll find and answer and it provides even more 
<br>
support for x.  Maybe the question was irrelevant and your friend was 
<br>
just trying to distract you because *he* had an emotional dislike for x 
<br>
and didn't want to even think of reasons why it might or might not be 
<br>
true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To say &quot;It's more important to me to get laid tonight than to graduate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; college&quot; is not illogical, it's just a goal weighting that many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider normatively suboptimal...
</em><br>
<p>This is what I discuss later on, but I think that any particular example 
<br>
should be as self inclusive as possible, so this one needs some work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is just silly...  If I were given this choice and the odds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extra $500 were 50%, I of course would take the 50% chance of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $500.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, Eli pointed out I got the numbers all wrong.  I remembered the 
<br>
outcome of the situation, but not the details.  Sloppy e-mail, as 
<br>
usual.  ;-)  Against my better judgment, I tried to pound that e-mail 
<br>
out in an hour late at night.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that, in each case that you describe, the real irrationality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down, not to incorrect inference on a micro level, but rather to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *emotionally biased inference control.*
</em><br>
<p>This is what I think, too, but I've gotten some bad reaction to 
<br>
explaining the situation that way, so I took a different approach last 
<br>
night.  The people that I've tried this explanation on either complain 
<br>
that I want to eliminate *all* bias, which is certainly a good goal but 
<br>
not possible depending on how broadly you define bias, or simply reject 
<br>
that it's impossible.  That's why the book project will be laid out 
<br>
something like this:
<br>
<p>Operators Manual for the Human Mind
<br>
<p>I.   The Human Brain
<br>
II.  The Human Mind
<br>
III. Ways of Human Thought
<br>
IV.  Rational Thought
<br>
<p>By the time there's any talk of rationality, the person will have some 
<br>
understanding of how the human mind works *to the best of our knowledge* 
<br>
so that an explanation of rational thought won't sound impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What &quot;irrationality&quot; is, in my view, is largely the following.  One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion that would be emotionally gratifying if it were true (and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a goal of gratifying the emotions in question).  One then biases the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information fed into one's logical inference component, in a specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oriented toward making the desired conclusion come true.  In a sense, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produces a divided mind, which &quot;intentionally&quot; (though perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unconsciously, still in a goal-oriented way) hides some knowledge that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has from some parts of itself.
</em><br>
<p>We're in complete agreement here.  A usual, when I let my fingers fly, 
<br>
something not quite like what I have in mind comes out (combined with 
<br>
trying to pick some angle other than my understanding to explain).
