<p>Much of this, yes.  Stealing credit cards, no.  Why bother?  Much too high 
<br>
profile for such small profit potential.

high-profile activities and became known.

<p>Not true.  We recognize silver back gorillas, queens of ant colonies and 
<br>
the head of a pride of lions.  Are they as powerful as us, no.  But we 
<br>
still recognize that they are more powerful than their peers.
