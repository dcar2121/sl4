<p>Yes.  I and others on this list are fans of evolutionary psychology 
<br>
because it explains a lot of why we act in ways that are against our 
<br>
best interests.  Evolution is really good at creating beings that are 
<br>
good at reproduction, because those that aren't good at it die out.  
<br>
Thus, humans and other animals are all wired to maximize the chances of 
<br>
reproduction and the chances that the offspring will go on to reproduce.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect that you and others here have adequately answered the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm real murky on how rationality fits into all this.
</em><br>
<p>Rational goals are those that result from some logical thought process.  
<br>
For example (highly simplified):  Eliezer sees the Singularity coming; 
<br>
Eliezer sees that the Singularity could potentially wipe out everyone 
<br>
and everything if it goes slightly wrong; ergo, Eliezer dedicates his 
<br>
life to creating a safe Singularity.  Irrational thinking would be if 
<br>
Eliezer had thought like this:  Eliezer sees the Singularity coming; 
<br>
Eliezer sees that the Singularity could potentially wipe out everyone 
<br>
and everything if it goes slightly wrong; Eliezer sees an attractive 
<br>
woman; Eliezer goes off with the woman and lets the Singularity be a 
<br>
hobby.  Even worse, he might have rationalized:  Eliezer goes off with 
<br>
the woman because he thinks that this experience will help him create a 
<br>
safer Singularity.  Without the right set of qualifiers on the woman, 
<br>
he'll be thinking this because his brain is tricking him into doing what 
<br>
it wants, i.e. reproducing.
<br>
<p>Rational goals don't just come out of no where, they follow logically 
<br>
from your knowledge.  Irrational goals don't follow logically and 
<br>
probably seem to come up out of nowhere (oh, I think I'd like vanilla 
<br>
ice cream today!).
