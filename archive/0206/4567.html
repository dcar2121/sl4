hi,
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you plan any &quot;containment&quot; features as part of your protocol?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As already stated on this list several times, we intend to give Novababy
<br>
read but not write access to the Internet, at first, until a lot of study
<br>
has been done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, I ask: do you plan to publish publicly any kind of basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your experimental protocol, and how it works at every step of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI design and testing to lower risks? It doesn't have to be now, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it should be available at a bare minimum 6 months before you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to have your full code up and running.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we will publish this publicly.  I can't promise it will be 6 months
<br>
before the codebase is complete, but it very likely will be, as this is
<br>
something I'll work on after the Novamente book work is done, and writing
<br>
the Novamente book should take less time than completing the codebase!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, since nowadays you are talking about having some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committee make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the final decision,
</em><br>
<p>Actually, as I said very many times on this list, what I thought was a good
<br>
idea was an *expert advisory board*, intimately involved with the project
<br>
when it reaches near-takeoff stage.  This does not imply that the advisory
<br>
board has final decision making power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if they come back to you and say &quot;The .01%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculated that your AI will go rogue at some point in the far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much in our opinion. Pull the plug.&quot; you will pull the plug?
</em><br>
<p>In that exact case, Brian, it would be a hard decision.  A .01% chance of an
<br>
AI going rogue at sometime in the far future is pretty damn small.
<br>
<p>What I'd really like the experts for is to help arrive at the .01% figure in
<br>
the first place, actually...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Higgins seems to want &quot;hundreds or thousands of relevant experts&quot; to agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is ok for you to &quot;push the big red button&quot;. Are you ok with that?
</em><br>
<p>I am not OK with that, but I believe he backpedaled on that particular
<br>
assertion.
<br>
<p>A consensus among a large committee of individualists is not plausibly going
<br>
to be achieved on *any* nontrivial issue.
<br>
