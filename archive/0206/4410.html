<em>&gt; &gt;This committee should be assembled in order to gather its opinions only,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; An excellent idea.
</em><br>
<p><p>OK, so we basically do agree on this....
<br>
<p>I agree that a such an advisory committee would work best if not tied
<br>
specifically to any one AI project.
<br>
<p>However, if such a thing were not convened by a group concerned with a
<br>
particular AI project, then by whom?
<br>
<p>The SIAI, in my view, is not really a general organization for &quot;AGI and the
<br>
Singularity,&quot; it's an organization largely (though not entirely) devoted to
<br>
Eliezer's particular approach to AGI and to Friendly AI.  Perhaps that is
<br>
not how it is intended, but that's how it comes across to me....
<br>
<p>It would be good to have something sorta like the SIAI, but explicitly NOT
<br>
tied to any one AI approach, or any one approach to Friendliness....  Such
<br>
an organization could be used to advocate the Singularity notion, and in
<br>
time to convene this advisory committee that you've proposed...
<br>
<p>Specifically, this organization should not fund any AGI research directly,
<br>
and though it might support work on the theory of the Singularity and
<br>
Friendliness, it should aspire to be as open-minded as possible in this
<br>
regard rather than developing a &quot;pet theory&quot;...
<br>
<p>However, I don't think there's any tremendous urgency to start such an
<br>
organization this year.  Sometime in the next 2-3 years would be good.
