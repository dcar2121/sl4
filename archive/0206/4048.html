<br>
<p><em>&gt; First off, attachment to humanity is a bias that prevents rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought.  I and others have broken this attachment to keep it from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clouding our thinking.  It is the result of being genetically related to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of humanity, where the death of all human genes is a big enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem to cause a person to give up a goal or die to save humanity.
</em><br>
<p>I sense a possible confusion here between loyalty to our
<br>
genes and loyalty to the actual extant 6,000,000,000 living
<br>
humans.  I have no loyalty towards the former, and in fact
<br>
strongly hope that we all get uploaded and saved from our
<br>
frail genetic housings.
<br>
<p>I do not agree with Eugen that you should be shot on site or
<br>
permanently imprisoned.  If I were on a star ship, however,
<br>
I would take whatever actions necessary to make sure that
<br>
you never got near the control room.  I want to live.  I also
<br>
want everyone else to live (forever).  I'm appalled at your
<br>
suicidal urge to replace us and our experiences with something
<br>
unknown and (from some biased itself point of view) &quot;better&quot;.
<br>
<p>Funny, though, how the longer one lives the more precious
<br>
life seems to become.  They draft 17 year olds because they'll
<br>
fearlessly charge machine gun nests.  I myself at 19 thought
<br>
that the human race would be better off not existing just
<br>
because, as you wrote, the &quot;world is full of pain and
<br>
suffering&quot;.  (What I failed to see at the time is that
<br>
it's equally full of joy and gladness, and it's obvious
<br>
now how evolution had to make it so.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some of us, myself included, see the creation of SI as important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to be more important than humanity's continuation.
</em><br>
<p>Yikes!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's in the interests of the Singularity and SI goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I not die, because my death would set back the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project quite a bit.
</em><br>
<p>Hollywood's mad scientists are not just figments of imagination!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, I'll go out of my way to make sure that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and everyone else doesn't die.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Especially everyone else, because if we all die then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goal can't be completed at all.
</em><br>
<p>I too think it's great when a region of space begins to
<br>
experience, when matter benefits.  And, yes, we poor humans
<br>
don't do much benefiting per cubic meter and our plants
<br>
and animals are even more pathetic.
<br>
<p>But at the same time, like I said, for many of us our
<br>
lives and benefit are simply not negotiable.
<br>
<p>Lee
