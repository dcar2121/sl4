<em>&gt;Hi james,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, we would hope that the team who created this AI doesn't give it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; access to the global network!  Or, if it does, it would be so highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; restrictive as to (at least for the near term, pre-super intelligence)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prevent such uncontrolled expansion.  However, they could conceivably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ignorant enough to grant such access or have a flaw in their security.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a tricky issue.  The global network is an important source of info
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for any AI in learning phase.  One wants to give one's young AI net access
</em><br>
<em>&gt;via a kind of &quot;reverse firewall&quot; that allows it to gather data but not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause damage.
</em><br>
<p>Right, that was my point.  It would have a highly controlled connection the 
<br>
Internet.  In today's terms it would have HTTP access to Get most 
<br>
things.  Post access would be removed or controlled.  No other protocols 
<br>
would be allowed.  And, preferably, the content of the HTTP traffic would 
<br>
be parsed to provide further filtration.  While it is conceivably be 
<br>
possible for an AI to extend itself out to the Internet via this 
<br>
connection, it would be very difficult.  It would probably take significant 
<br>
effort and research to do so, which could be spotted (hopefully) by the 
<br>
nature of the information being retrieved.  However, when the AI got 
<br>
significantly more Intelligent than Humans the chance of escape would 
<br>
obviously go up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;co-evolutionary competition and population pressure the AIs will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;start designing and building new hardware, which allows them to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And just how would they make the leap from running on silicon to building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; silicon?  I'm almost certain that there is no capacity to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; today.  They would have to be able to perform 100% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manufacturing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assembly operation completely via computer, assemble the working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and connect it to the net.  All without human intervention.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was a facility which had all of this capability computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; controlled (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't believe is the case, much of it is manual - moving pieces between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manufacturing workstations, etc) the operators would have to sit there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; while the machines spent hours (days?) &quot;doing their own thing&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Your point is an excellent one.  However, there are plenty of scenarios one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can conjure to counter it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For instance, suppose the AI finds a way to threaten a lot of people with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;death, and then basically *blackmails* humans into creating a fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;automated computer-and-robot-manufacturing facility for it....
</em><br>
<p>True, but it would take considerable time to construct such a facility.  I 
<br>
know it takes one major chip manufacturer about 2 years to construct their 
<br>
chip fabs (plus 10+ billion dollars).  Blackmailing to this degree would be 
<br>
very, very difficult.  Oh, and the chip fab is not an end-to-end facility, 
<br>
obviously.  Assuming that the needed facility was an order of magnitude 
<br>
smaller/cheaper than the mentioned chip fab it would still be very 
<br>
difficult to blackmail for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Or, more probably, suppose it finds some group of humans and promises them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lots of goodies if they build it the right automated manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facilities....  it's almost inconceivable that an AGI, capable of predicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;financial markets and hence getting lots of $$, couldn't find *some* group
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of humans to build it whatever it wanted for cash payment...
</em><br>
<p>True, and while more plausible than blackmail it would still take 
<br>
significant time (measured in months).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I can see a future gov't wasting a lot of effort protecting against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;military-style attacks by AGI, and then finding that an AGI actually takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over the world via financial &amp; political machinations...
</em><br>
<p>Right, I don't think governments will play much (if any) role in the coming 
<br>
Singularity.
