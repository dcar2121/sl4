<p>No it doesn't. You just have to put your bits where your logic is.  
<br>
(Despite proven nonlocality physical processes are intrinsically locally
<br>
coupled, since an event can't influence others lying outside its light
<br>
cone, so it's not that much of a limitation -- unless your life processes
<br>
are not based on something as exotic as, say, recursive wormholing).If
<br>
your switches are single molecules operating on bits stored in adjacent
<br>
molecules the shortest switch time will have to be above the time it takes
<br>
light to cross the volume. (You don't want your switches to radiate
<br>
light). In practice, even with reversible logic you will run into power
<br>
dissipation issues way before. (Of course, fractal cooling channels with a
<br>
high flux of coolant dilute your circuitry, increasing average distances).
<br>
<p>Also hitherto I regarded stable strangelets as science fiction, but
<br>
apparently some theories do allow them, and a couple of people even
<br>
postulated a corellated twin tremor as a strangelet clump passage through
<br>
Earth (maybe they should limit their crack intake).  Depending on their
<br>
properties they might be useful for very small, very hot computers (e.g.
<br>
mechanical ones driven by nuclear processes, e.g. fusion). Bootstrap
<br>
issues loom large once again, though, since even if you can mine the stuff
<br>
floating between the stars it doesn't mean you can process it (what's
<br>
Young's modulus of strangletronium?).

let us.

<p><em>&gt; strongly suspect we will exert ever increasing 'pressure' on this

<p>Indeed, since superluminal velocities are equivalent to time travel, and 
<br>
likely would require spacetime plumbing.
