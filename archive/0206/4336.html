<p>Not many. Toaster's world is simple, and hence it's an exceedingly simply

<p>Would you like your reality light or medium brown?

<p><em>&gt; create an Artificial Intelligence.  One that, in fact, may end up thinking

<p>No. You're trying to create an AI that can learn from its environment. An 
<br>
AI is Not a Toaster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and working in much different ways than human minds do.  Thus the

it better be competitive.

<p><em>&gt; complexity of a baby (which is pointless anyway since the heart, liver,

</em><br>
<p>The baby doesn't have to worry about the monetary system or the network 
<br>
protocol either. Further, I gave you some slack by putting the baby as the 
<br>
upper bound. You might find out that's not that much slack.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What I'm saying is that an AI has to have a large fraction of the world to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be represented in it before it even can start to learn. Because the world
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also very much not true.  If the AI only understood math but could learn

</em><br>
<p>No. It would not be naturally intelligent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; like to succeed?
</em><br>
<p>It would not succeed. It would be an useful idiot (savant). Bring on that 
<br>
good stuff, we have sore need of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, an engineering solution NEVER has to be dirty and complex in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solve a dirty &amp; complex problem.  An inelegant solution will produce less 
</em><br>
<p>Correction: the engineering solution to the problem class you're familiar 
<br>
with. If you think you understand the AI class of problems, you most 
<br>
definitely don't understand the AI class of problems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; than reasonable performance and/or won't be flexible.  Thus a successful AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation will almost certainly be elegant, otherwise it would require 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rut shortly after leaving the gate.  And thus would be beat to the punch 
</em><br>
<p>You assume you can make it leave the gate in an orderly and elegant shape. 
<br>
I fear this is pure wishful thinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by the first elegant implementation to surface.

<p>Where's the URL of your demo?
