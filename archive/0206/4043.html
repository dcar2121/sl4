<p>Agreed.  It's a good one to break.  It can be a bit hard to stop being 
<br>
attached to living, but it is possible.  This does not mean that I'm 
<br>
suicidal, though.  If a situation presented itself, however, where the 
<br>
universe would benefit from my death, I'd go right ahead and die.

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Let's say I'm responsible for the Seed AI for a time (I hope no 
<br>
one person is ever bears all responsibility, but this is just 
<br>
hypothetical).  It's in the interests of the Singularity and SI goal 
<br>
that I not die, because my death would set back the project quite a 
<br>
bit.  Therefore, I'll go out of my way to make sure that I and everyone 
<br>
else doesn't die.  Especially everyone else, because if we all die then 
<br>
the goal can't be completed at all.
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to above, I don't mind executing you in person. Okay?)
</em><br>
<p>I don't really know how to explain the position to you.  It's not that I 
<br>
have an apathy towards human life; I'd like to see human life stay 
<br>
around in one form or another.  At the same time, I see the goal of 
<br>
creating SI as more important than creating more humans that will be 
<br>
born into a world full of pain and suffering.  Furthermore, in my 
<br>
opinion, humans will last maybe another 100 years at most if we continue 
<br>
without a Singularity.  Unless something happens to make all of humanity 
<br>
suddenly rational, humans will kill themselves one way or another when 
<br>
they build a big enough weapon to do it.  Tribal thinking doesn't work 
<br>
well when the stick gets too big.
<br>
<p>We have a chance to move beyond the limits of human thinking and create 
<br>
something that can go on to do new and interesting things that humans 
<br>
can't even begin to conceive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not overly surprised that such attitudes exist (random noise gave us
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of having said something similiar in person, but I hope you don't mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we reserve a special circle in hell for those with broken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empathy-circuits.
</em><br>
<p>If I thought I might be going to hell one day, I wouldn't be a very 
<br>
rational person.
