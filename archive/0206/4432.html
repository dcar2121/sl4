</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You strengthen my point.  The US military has evolved ethics because of the
<br>
terrible power that they are entrusted to use.  Why else have the strict
<br>
honor system at military schools?  Furthermore, knowledge that individual
<br>
soldiers are capable of war crimes only encourages future military
<br>
planners to substitute an AGI for a soldier (or augment/monitor a
<br>
soldier) in that situation.  According to my understanding of CFAI, the
<br>
AGI should be resistant to criminal behavior due to a deep knowledge of
<br>
ethics.  From which follows my conclusion that an AGI would not follow an
<br>
illegal military order.
<br>
<p>More ethics info regarding my recent notion that military ethics may serve
<br>
to educate an AGI can be found at a military web site and its links list:

<p><em>&gt; The Singularity is directly opposed to the national interests of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular national government, because it will almost inevitably lead to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;revolution&quot; that will make national boundaries meaningless.
</em><br>
<p>Well for me the Singularity is something that I cannot see beyond, so I
<br>
will respond to your statement as though I agree with the premise and
<br>
offer this counterexample of the second statement in your argument:
<br>
<p>Recent history shows that national governments will surrender sovereignty
<br>
for a greater good.  Witness the EU and NAFTA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, no government should be trusted to play a leading role in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Not only do I have the opposite opinion, I believe that as the evidence
<br>
mounts that an AGI is possible, the government - and in particular the US
<br>
government will take the leading role.  I believe this from my
<br>
understanding of the dynamics of how our government institutions have
<br>
responded to the great technical challenges over my lifetime -  The Space
<br>
Race, the War On Cancer, Safe Cars, Solar Energy, The AIDS Epidemic ...
<br>
I do not see any non-governmental organization as the front-runner.  The
<br>
actual work of developing and educating the Seed AI would in my opinion be
<br>
performed by private contracting companies - somewhat in competition with
<br>
each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I might accept gov't funding for AGI research, but I would never willingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place control of an AGI in the hands of any military organization.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really scares me.  Those people are not Singularity-savvy, and I don't trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will become so in the future, not in any healthy way.  Plus, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests are not those of the human race as a whole, let alone of sentience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a whole.
</em><br>
<p>My belief that the funding will be from the defense budget stems from my
<br>
conclusion that an AGI would be priceless for our nation's defense, and
<br>
knowing this the military will fund before other government institutions.
<br>
<p>My comfort with military research organization (e.g. Darpa) leading and
<br>
coordinating this effort is from my own experience and I am not going to
<br>
persuade anyone else (lacking to skills to do so).
<br>
<p>Overall I believe that our constitutional, representative government has
<br>
the best chance of marshaling citizen support and addressing the reasoned
<br>
dissent sure to come in the face of mounting evidence that an AGI is
<br>
possible.  Regardless of popular opinion towards the government, I
<br>
speculate that all other alternative coordinating organizations would be
<br>
judged inferior by the public.
