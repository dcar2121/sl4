<p>
Deering appears to write
<br>
&lt;&lt;What to do?  As much as I hate the idea, the best option I see is
<br>
&nbsp;to outlaw privacy.  But this does not seem to be practical in the 
<br>
present political environment.  Alternatively we could treat bio 
<br>
viruses like computer viruses, with firewalls and antiviral software. 
<br>
&nbsp;Firewalls would consist of each home being equivalent to a level 3
<br>
&nbsp;bio containment facility with hepa filters and decontamination air 
<br>
locks.  When you went outside you would wear a racal hood with
<br>
&nbsp;a virus filter and exhaust fan along with a virus impervious body suit.  
<br>
The anti-virus software would be by subscription to a daily antibody 
<br>
update.  This would require the development of systems that could 
<br>
make a vaccine for a new virus in 24 hours or less.  We are not quite
<br>
&nbsp;there yet.&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Enlighten me. How would privacy be outlawed?  With crypto getting 
<br>
better and better versus intrusion methods I mean.
<br>
<p>Easy hard take off seed ai seems downright likely next to the functional
<br>
illegalization of privacy.....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
On the other hand you could just put lots of ocean between you and
<br>
any target.... That would go far towards solving the bio angle.
<br>
Yacht anyone, anyone?
