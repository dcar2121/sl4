hi brian,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's important to put in protections against unexpected hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takeoff, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the effective design of these protections is hard, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right way to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it will only be determined thru experimentation with actual AGI systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (again, experimental science)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not good enough. No AI project should find itself in the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of both being in a potential takeoff situation, and simultaneously having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no mechanisms to prevent a takeoff. If you can't figure this out, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should never run your code in the first place. To me, this looks like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another case of your overoptimism (which is the exact opposite of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required when dealing with existential risks- you need to practice walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around all the time expecting doom) leading to unnecessary risks.
</em><br>
<p>Well, Brian, on this point I am willing to partially concede that you're
<br>
right ;)
<br>
<p>The difference of opinion between us seems to be that I think there will be
<br>
a moderately long phase in which we have an AGI system that:
<br>
<p>a) has an interesting degree of general intelligence, suitable for
<br>
experimenting with and learning about AGI
<br>
<p>b) has no chance of undergoing a hard takeoff
<br>
<p>You and Eliezer seem to assume that as soon as a system has an
<br>
at-all-significant degree of general intelligence, it's a nontrivial hard
<br>
takeoff risk.  As if, say, a &quot;digital dog&quot; is going to solve the hard
<br>
computer/cognitive science problems of optimizing and improving its own
<br>
sourcecode!
<br>
<p>Maybe under Eli's design for AGI, a) and b) are not compatible, but in
<br>
Novamente they are.
<br>
<p>I think we have confidence about different things.  You and Eli seem to have
<br>
more optimism than me that simple hard-takeoff-prevention mechanisms will
<br>
work.  And I seem to have more confidence than you that there will be a
<br>
period of infrahuman AGI in which the risk of hard takeoff is very very very
<br>
very low, in which all sorts of things to do with computer consciousness,
<br>
hard takeoff prevention, intelligence measurement and AGI in general can be
<br>
studied.
<br>
<p>I can accept that perhaps I'm overoptimistic, and left to my own devices I
<br>
might wait too long to put appropriate protection in the system.  But the
<br>
Novamente project involves a diverse crew, and it's incredibly unlikely that
<br>
a serious hard takeoff risk would be created by us without *one* of the team
<br>
members wanting to put in protection.  So an error in judgment on my part
<br>
would not be enough to cause danger, as it's not an autocratic project at
<br>
all, it would have to be an error in judgment among 10 people all of whom
<br>
understand these issues pretty well, and have different perspectives on it.
<br>
and this is just talking about the Novamente team, not any advisors that
<br>
have been assembled due to the team's perception of the plausibility of soon
<br>
entering a hard takeoff situation.
<br>
<p>Anyway, having said all that, the bottom line is: On this point I am willing
<br>
to partially concede.  Perhaps my past attitude has been too cavalier in
<br>
this regard.  Based on the concerns of you, Eli, James and others, I will
<br>
put a significant &quot;unexpected hard takeoff prevention&quot; system into the
<br>
system significantly before my intuition tells me to.  I'll put a very
<br>
simple such system in now, even though it's not useful yet, and put in a
<br>
more serious such system together with the goal system when the goal system
<br>
is implemented.  (As a hard takeoff is essentially impossible before the
<br>
goal system is implemented; the system is really just a problem-solving
<br>
engine, not a mind, before that point.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, it is a tough decision to decide when an AGI should be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; increase its intelligence unprotectedly.  A group of Singularity wizards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be consulted, it shouldn't be left up to one guy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; MAYBE I will also replace the references to my own personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; references to some kind of generic &quot;transhumanist morality.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would take a little research into what articulations of transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morality already exist.  I know the Extropian stuff, but for my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taste, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generally emphasizes the virtue of compassion far too little....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Speaking as a human who is potentially affected by your AI, this isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good enough for me. You'll have to come up with a better answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willingly go along with such a plan.
</em><br>
<p>This is a point that I'm far less willing to concede on, Brian.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you guys don't really accept the diversity of human
<br>
ethical systems.  There simply is no consensus ethics in the human race.
<br>
There are a lot of people who think that creating computers displaying
<br>
apparent consciousness is immoral, that using computers for drug discovery
<br>
or life extension is immoral, etc. etc.
<br>
<p>It is not possible to teach Novababy a &quot;universal human morality or ethics&quot;
<br>
because no such thing exists.  A particular choice has to be made, just as a
<br>
choice has to be made when raising a child, which particular morals to
<br>
inculcate them with.
<br>
<p>The best you're going to get on this score is an invitation to participate
<br>
in teaching Novababy when it's ready for that.  Then your own particular
<br>
twist of the human ethical code will get to play a role in Novababy's
<br>
initial condition too.  Note that I'll invite you for this because your code
<br>
is reasonably similar to my own.  Osama bin Laden  will probably not get  an
<br>
invitation, although he is just as human as us and has his own moral code,
<br>
roughly shared by at least tens of millions of others.
<br>
<p>I'm sorry if this makes you uncomfortable.  The alternative proposed in
<br>
CFAI, insofar as I understand it, makes no sense to me, after repeated
<br>
readings and discussions.  A lot of the CFAI document does make sense to me,
<br>
but not this aspect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm glad of your uncertainty, but you're not handling it like you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationally handle it in the case of an existential risk- you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more like you would starting a business with someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money, and if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't work out then &quot;oops, oh well&quot;. Not good enough
</em><br>
<p>While I understand the need to temper my natural entrepreneurial,
<br>
risk-taking streak in these matters, I think your criticism is a bit too
<br>
strong here.  You need to understand that my estimate of the current
<br>
existential risk of Novamente having a hard takeoff is really
<br>
infinitesimally small.  That is why I do not take the risk seriously.  This
<br>
risk is vastly less than the risk of nuclear war breaking out and killing
<br>
everyone for example.  As Novamente progresses a real existential risk will
<br>
one day emerge, and *as we get closer to that that point* (before actually
<br>
reaching it!)  I will start taking it very seriously.
<br>
<p>By the way, I treat starting a business with someone else's money the exact
<br>
same way I treat starting a business with my own money.  In fact I was a lot
<br>
more fiscally conservative than some of our investor/executives at Webmind
<br>
Inc.  I am not afraid to risk my own cash or my own time (or even if it came
<br>
to it, which is hasn't yet, my own life) on my ideas, not at all.  My life
<br>
history shows this pretty well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Any other legitimate things Eliezer or others pointed out to you privately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or publicly should be addressed. The issue should be looked at from all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides. Three times. Then look at it again.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  There is time for that, because Novamente has effectively zero
<br>
existential risk at the moment.
<br>
<p>The design, if fully implemented, would in my view pose a real existential
<br>
risk, but it is just not there yet.
<br>
