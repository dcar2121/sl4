</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree with Samantha on this point: Super Intelligence does not equate to,
<br>
or converge to Wisdom.  Intelligence can be used to build/obtain wisdom, but
<br>
that doesn't just *happen* by default... at least I have never encountered a
<br>
convincing argument that it does.  There is zero evidence from the our
<br>
single data point (humanity) that intelligence automatically converges on
<br>
wisdom, or altruism, or selfishness for that matter.  I would profoundly
<br>
*hope* that it does by default, but hoping isn't good enough when we are
<br>
dealing with existential risks.  Anyone who cares about their own future
<br>
(and that of everyone else too) should do everything they can to face the
<br>
problem squarely, and try to solve it.
<br>
<p>The problem: How to arrange things so that an SI builds/obtains a high level
<br>
of wisdom.
<br>
<p>And the really dodgey part is how to define wisdom.
<br>
<a href="http://intelligence.org/CFAI/">http://intelligence.org/CFAI/</a> makes a pretty good start at this.  But its just a
<br>
start.  Defining Friendliness content is going to be a hell of a job.
