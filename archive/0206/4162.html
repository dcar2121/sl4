<em> &gt; Our seed AI is going to get its human-level intelligence, not purely by

</em><br>
<p>Ah.  Well, again we have very different models of intelligence.  I don't 
<br>
think you can use human knowledge as the mindstuff of an AI.  I don't think 
<br>
AI can be built by borrowing human content.  What we're after is what 
<br>
produced that content.  One is building brainware and, in the early stages, 
<br>
guiding that brainware into creating content.  There may be some 
<br>
opportunities to nudge the AI into creating better content than she 
<br>
otherwise would have, but this violates the self-encapsulation rule of seed 
<br>
AI; an AI doesn't own a thought until she can produce it on her own. 
<br>
Initially almost all of AI development will violate this rule, of course, 
<br>
but the measure of how far you've gotten in constructing real, independent 
<br>
AI, an AI that has her own thoughts and isn't just churning through yours, 
<br>
is not having to do this any more.
<br>
<p>So you look at pouring human content into an AI, and say, &quot;When we reach 
<br>
human-level, we will run out of mindstuff.&quot;  And I look at creating AI as 
<br>
the task of building more and more of that essential spark that *creates* 
<br>
content - with the transfer of any content the AI could not have created on 
<br>
her own, basically a bootstrap method or side issue - and say:  &quot;When the AI 
<br>
reaches human level, she will be able to swallow the thoughts that went into 
<br>
her own creation; she will be able to improve her own spark, recursively.&quot;
<br>
<p>An AI will have much to learn from human mind-content, but by the time 
<br>
reaching human-level is anything like an issue, the most important part of 
<br>
what she knows will belong to her; it won't be borrowed from humans.
<br>
<p>(Hm.  I think ve/vis/ver was better after all.)
