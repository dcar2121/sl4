<p>Above sentence refers to useful, provably correct systems. We can't do
<br>
these (in fact I conjecture a useful, provably correct system is
<br>
impossible). I explicitly mentioned embarrassingly parallel codes -- such
<br>
as distributed.net uses -- a few lines down.

<p>MOSIX? I don't recall mentioning transparent process migration in the

<p>If I'm not up to date, you're apparently unaware of what much has been

<p>Significant progresses as far as marketing and politics is concerned,

sure. None as far as Computer Science is concerned.
