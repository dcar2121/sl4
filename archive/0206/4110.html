</em><br>
<p>Eliezer, I understand and appreciate the points you made. I, too, would 
<br>
like to see enormously increased efforts towards intelligence augmentation 
<br>
(more than towards AI, though the two will overlap).
<br>
<p>However, since you cc'ed me on your message, I want to point something out 
<br>
that I'm not sure you are particularly aware of. Though your message called 
<br>
for Ray in particular to fund technological research that you see as 
<br>
important to the Singularity (to use the term that I continue to have 
<br>
reservations about), it's clear that you believe that your own work should 
<br>
be funded. I know that you are supremely confident in your own abilities. 
<br>
You are surrounded by those who you have convinced. I feel that it's up to 
<br>
me to point out more explicitly that not everyone shares your view of your 
<br>
research. I have no idea of Ray's opinion on this, but I do know the 
<br>
opinion of a number of other intelligent and informed people. I share the 
<br>
view of those who are highly skeptical of your expectations for your work. 
<br>
I and others would no doubt be more impressed if you were to demonstrate 
<br>
some actual results.
<br>
<p>I hope you show us to be mistaken. And I write this with no intention of 
<br>
offending you. It's just my view and, I know, that of some others. If Ray 
<br>
-- or anyone else -- does not fund your work, it could be that the reason 
<br>
is not the goal but lack of confidence in your abilities at this stage.
<br>
<p>If I had a few billion, I would probably throw some resources your way just 
<br>
in case. As it is, I may not be the only one who supports your general 
<br>
sense of urgency to fund intelligence augmentation (not necessarily the 
<br>
approach you favor) but who isn't at all convinced that you are the One.
<br>
<p>On a more positive note, someone looking for funding might be interested in 
<br>
this:
<br>
<p>DARPA ANNOUNCES RESEARCH INITIATIVE IN COGNITIVE SYSTEMS
<br>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) today announced a new 
<br>
research initiative in the field of cognitive systems, releasing a Broad 
<br>
Agency Announcement (BAA) seeking innovative research proposals.
<br>
<p>The DARPA Cognitive Information Processing Technology Initiative will 
<br>
develop the next generation of computational systems with radically new 
<br>
capabilities. &quot;Cognitive systems&quot; will demonstrate levels of autonomy and 
<br>
reasoning far beyond those of today's systems. With the ability to reason, 
<br>
learn and adapt, and with facilities for self-awareness, these will 
<br>
literally be systems that know what they're doing.
