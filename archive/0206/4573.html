<em>&gt; You and Eliezer seem to assume that as soon as a system has an

</em><br>
<em>&gt; takeoff risk.  As if, say, a &quot;digital dog&quot; is going to solve the hard

<em>&gt; computer/cognitive science problems of optimizing and improving its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sourcecode!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe under Eli's design for AGI, a) and b) are not compatible, but in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You /think/ they are, you mean. BTW, have you read this paper?
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanist.com/Waste.htm">http://www.transhumanist.com/Waste.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we have confidence about different things.  You and Eli seem to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more optimism than me that simple hard-takeoff-prevention mechanisms will
</em><br>
<p>We have little optimism about any of this. In fact we still worry something
<br>
will go wrong even with that little thing we are going to be paying you to
<br>
do. Our goal is to OVERengineer so many safety mechanisms in our design
<br>
such that we never even come close to exceeding some &quot;maximum risk level&quot;.
<br>
I think this is all in CFAI somewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm glad of your uncertainty, but you're not handling it like you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rationally handle it in the case of an existential risk- you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; handling it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more like you would starting a business with someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; money, and if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't work out then &quot;oops, oh well&quot;. Not good enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While I understand the need to temper my natural entrepreneurial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk-taking streak in these matters, I think your criticism is a bit too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong here.  You need to understand that my estimate of the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential risk of Novamente having a hard takeoff is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitesimally small.  That is why I do not take the risk seriously.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk is vastly less than the risk of nuclear war breaking out and killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone for example.  As Novamente progresses a real existential risk will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one day emerge, and *as we get closer to that that point* (before actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaching it!)  I will start taking it very seriously.
</em><br>
<p>Famous last words? You seem uncertain about so many other issues, but on
<br>
this one you are so utterly sure that an outside organization had to pay
<br>
you just to get your coders to spend a few weeks adding a simple takeoff
<br>
notification warning system? I think somehow you are still missing my
<br>
point. The point to reiterate is not about what your own intuition is
<br>
regarding the risk. The point is to always imagine that you might be
<br>
wrong, and if there is a relatively simple addition you can make to the
<br>
design to reduce or eliminate the risk you should always do that. What
<br>
is three weeks compared to that paper I referenced above?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the way, I treat starting a business with someone else's money the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same way I treat starting a business with my own money.  In fact I was a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more fiscally conservative than some of our investor/executives at Webmind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inc.  I am not afraid to risk my own cash or my own time (or even if it came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it, which is hasn't yet, my own life) on my ideas, not at all.  My life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history shows this pretty well.
</em><br>
<p>Good for you, although the .com era shows that some other people were not
<br>
so good at taking risks with other people's property. Sometimes your ideas
<br>
regarding embedding your own morality into your AI make me feel that you
<br>
are doing almost the same type of thing: acting in a riskier and less
<br>
critical fashion since you feel like there is going to be less or no risk
<br>
to yourself due to the AI acting in accordance with your beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any other legitimate things Eliezer or others pointed out to you privately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or publicly should be addressed. The issue should be looked at from all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sides. Three times. Then look at it again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course.  There is time for that, because Novamente has effectively zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential risk at the moment.
</em><br>
<p>In your opinion
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The design, if fully implemented, would in my view pose a real existential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk, but it is just not there yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>In your opinion
<br>
<p>You are certainly the wisest person on the planet to know all this with
<br>
such certainty that you feel ok with playing dice with us all.
