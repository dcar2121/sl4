<em>&gt; Suppose I did think that I was uniquely suited to playing a key role in
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Then you'd almost surely be deluded, at least if you *literally* thought
<br>
this.  There are 6 billion folks in the world, so how could you possibly
<br>
know you were *uniquely* suited for this purpose?
<br>
<p>If you merely thought you were *very well suited* for it, that would be a
<br>
lot more rational-sounding...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, I still think you're confusing &quot;You are wrong&quot; with &quot;I am right&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so.  There are plenty of other people in the world who think
<br>
I'm wrong in my theories.  Many of them think I'm *much wronger than you
<br>
do*!  Many of them think that I'm wrong that AGI is possible, or wrong that
<br>
such a thing as the Singularity will ever happen!  Yet, the fact that these
<br>
people think I'm wrong, does not lead me to ascribe to them an
<br>
overconfidence in their opinions...
<br>
<p>Anyway, I suppose that the issue of Eli's psychology and Ben's
<br>
interpretation of it is probably not very interesting to others; therefore I
<br>
suggest we terminate this thread and if we wish, continue it in private!
<br>
<p>Back to the usual technophilosophy, I say ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The strongest statement I would make about Friendly AI is &quot;I've been
</em><br>
looking
<br>
<em>&gt; at this section of floor for two years, I have my trap detectors shoved
</em><br>
out
<br>
<em>&gt; to absolute maximum, and I still haven't detected any basic flaws, so at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this point, even taking into account how much is at stake, I'm ready to
</em><br>
put
<br>
<em>&gt; one foot down and start shifting my weight over.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I and others have tried to point out some basic flaws in your thinking
<br>
on the topic for some time now, but you just won't listen!!  (Or rather, you
<br>
just don't agree ;).
<br>
<p>I still don't believe that you are anywhere near to understanding the
<br>
conditions under which a human-Friendly AGI goal system will be stable under
<br>
successive self-modifications... even mild and minor ones...
