<p>Any major movement is accompanied by some sort of
<br>
philosophy, including art &amp; lit. It both prepares the
<br>
society for the change, and advances the change
<br>
itself. JFK poured tons of cash into the moonlanding,
<br>
but his famous speach is remembered for preparing the
<br>
Nation and sparking an interest that made it all
<br>
(including the $$$) possible.
<br>
<p><p>(excerpts - 1962, Rice Stadium)
<br>
&quot;...This is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace
<br>
cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new
<br>
ignorance, new problems, new dangers. Surely the
<br>
opening vistas of space promise high costs and
<br>
hardships, as well as high reward. 
<br>
<p>&quot;So it is not surprising that some would have us stay
<br>
where we are a little longer to rest, to wait. But
<br>
this city of Houston, this State of Texas, this
<br>
country of the United States was not built by those
<br>
who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.
<br>
This country was conquered by those who moved
<br>
forward--and so will space...
<br>
<p>&quot;William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of
<br>
the Plymouth Bay Colony, said that all great and
<br>
honorable actions are accompanied with great
<br>
difficulties, and both must be enterprised and
<br>
overcome with answerable courage. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If this capsule history of our progress teaches us
<br>
anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge
<br>
and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred.
<br>
The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we
<br>
join in it or not, and it is one of the great
<br>
adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to
<br>
be the leader of other nations can expect to stay
<br>
behind in the race for space...
<br>
<p>&quot;We set sail on this new sea because there is new
<br>
knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and
<br>
they must be won and used for the progress of all
<br>
people. For space science, like nuclear science and
<br>
all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether
<br>
it will become a force for good or ill depends on man,
<br>
and only if the United States occupies a position of
<br>
pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean
<br>
will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of
<br>
war. I do not say the we should or will go unprotected
<br>
against the hostile misuse of space any more than we
<br>
go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea,
<br>
but I do say that space can be explored and mastered
<br>
without feeding the fires of war, without repeating
<br>
the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ
<br>
around this globe of ours...
<br>
<p>&quot;And it will be done before the end of this decade...
<br>
<p>&quot;--even though I realize that this is in some measure
<br>
an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know
<br>
what benefits await us...
<br>
<p>&quot;And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing
<br>
on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest
<br>
adventure on which man has ever embarked.&quot;
