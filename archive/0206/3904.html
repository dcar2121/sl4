<p>
I've been a chess master most of my life (Elo 2207), but
<br>
was more famous for my students than for my play---one,
<br>
Larry Christiansen, became U.S. champion.  In Go, I
<br>
almost reached Sho Dan.
<br>
<p>In 1966 at the age of eighteen, I became engrossed in
<br>
what I call &quot;the Identity Paradox&quot;, shortly after becoming
<br>
a materialist.  What are the implications, I'd ask, of
<br>
having an exact molecular copy of myself?  I immediately
<br>
seized upon the solution, principled from the physics
<br>
viewpoint, that there is no objective difference between
<br>
someone and his duplicate, a view that I still hold.  I
<br>
consider one consequence, &quot;the Paradox of Anticipation&quot;
<br>
to be profoundly unsolvable.
<br>
<p>I entered programming late, and even now, twenty years
<br>
later, it's a living but only that.
<br>
<p>I've been at SL4 for about fifteen years.  In 1981 my
<br>
friend and I saw the singularity coming, which we called
<br>
&quot;the wall&quot;, because it was obvious that if you stand
<br>
back far enough from a graph of progress, it resembles
<br>
nothing so much as a transistor switching from 0 to 1.
<br>
We certainly didn't think so clearly about it as did
<br>
Vernor Vinge a few years later, and I'm amazed at how
<br>
far some here and elsewhere have now taken the ideas.
<br>
<p>I only rejoined on-line discussion groups last year, and
<br>
have been rather blown away by the changes since I left.
<br>
I left extropians in 1996 because almost no one wanted to
<br>
discuss questions at what I would now call the SL4 level.
<br>
My last post was &quot;The VR Solipsist&quot;, to which there were
<br>
no replies.  No replies, that is, until 2001, when I got
<br>
an email from Robin Hanson on March 13 telling me that
<br>
Hal Finney had remembered my post from way back then.
<br>
A new thread, &quot;How to live in a simulation&quot; was going
<br>
over some of the same ideas.  Robin posted an excerpt
<br>
of my original post, and I've been back on-line so far
<br>
as time permits ever since.
<br>
<p>I have complained to friends that I haven't really made
<br>
philosophic progress the last five or so years, perhaps
<br>
even since the late 80's.  That's what I'm interested in:
<br>
to obtain the most advanced viewpoint I can.
<br>
<p>Well, I found a new world upon returning.  Talk of the singularity
<br>
abounded (even with entire books being written about it!), and
<br>
accounts of fantastic and amazingly sophisticated efforts at AI.
<br>
Eliezer and Ben say everything I'm thinking, and more, and
<br>
probably better than I can.  So I'll evidently be mostly
<br>
content to listen.
<br>
