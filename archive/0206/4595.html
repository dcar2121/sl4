Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; You seem to have this idea that there is some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;meta-rightness&quot; standard by which different ethical standards can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; judged more or less correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; There is no such thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem awfully certain about that.  (Heh.  I finally got to use that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line.)
</em><br>
<p>Well I'm certain that no human has proposed such a thing in a sensible way,
<br>
and highly (though not totally) certain that no human is going to in the
<br>
next few decades.
<br>
<p>Maybe an AI will someday ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben, you're a member of a species that has spent the last few hundred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand years arguing politics and morality with occasional pauses to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat and sleep.  Is it really that strange if I suggest that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex functional adaptations which influence your choice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declarative moral beliefs?
</em><br>
<p>Of course there are, I am a biological being, not totally detached and
<br>
impartial...
<br>
<p>My desire to see the human race survive is itself a &quot;complex functional
<br>
adaptation&quot;...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is actually a rather Zen situation; you have meta-ethics but you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know you have meta-ethics.  I wish now I had some formal training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Zen methods of getting people to realize that they possess a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience by just having them *see* it, without a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verbal argument.
</em><br>
<p>If you attack me with a stick, watch out -- I bite!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's start with a moral question.  Some people even today, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thankfully not as many as there a few generations ago, believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of certain races (or at least, what they regard as &quot;races&quot;) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrinsically worth less than others.  You have a different morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under which race makes no difference to intrinsic worth.  Now I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking you why you believe these other people are wrong, because if so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll just answer &quot;Because their morality conflicts with mine&quot;; rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm asking you why you don't share their morality.  If morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genuinely arbitrary then one mapping of sentiences to intrinsic value is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as good as any other; why is your morality different from theirs?
</em><br>
<p>Being &quot;worth less&quot; is ambiguous...
<br>
<p>If the argument is that blacks are extremely less intelligent than whites
<br>
(an argument made in the past by  many people), this is an empirically
<br>
testable statement,  and has been refuted [yes, I know there is a slight IQ
<br>
difference among races, with whites getting higher than blacks and orientals
<br>
getting higher than whites -- but this is not the sort of thing I'm tallking
<br>
about...]
<br>
<p>If the argument is that blacks don't have souls, then I guess it's outside
<br>
the domain of experiment and logic...
<br>
<p>I'm not sure I would agree that &quot;morality is genuinely arbitrary.&quot;  I would
<br>
say that there is no objective scientific or logical way to judge one moral
<br>
system versus another. Because any system of judging presumes some
<br>
&quot;criterion of merit&quot;; the choice of criterion of merit will then determine
<br>
which moral system is better.... of course, one can then ask which criterion
<br>
of merit is better
<br>
<p>However, it could nonetheless be the case that highly intelligent systems
<br>
tend toward certain moral systems, as opposed to others.  Just as modern
<br>
technological culture tends toward different moral systems than tribal
<br>
culture....
<br>
