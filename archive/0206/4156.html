<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;From everything I have read here and elsewhere, the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; coming along rather nicely without your efforts.  So why do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; special project is required?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think your statement is partly a variant on a common paradox.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Another variant of this paradox is: &quot;Why vote?  If I don't vote, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cares,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm just one among very  many voters.&quot;  But yet if everyone thought that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way, the election wouldn't happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I disagree.  The vast vast majority of people enabling the singularity have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never heard of it.  Voting takes a conscious effort, the singularity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being brought about almost exclusively by people advancing technology for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other purposes.  If you and Eliezer and the few others quit tomorrow, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would still be huge numbers of people working on distributed systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quantum computing, building better communications systems, nanotech,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;microtech, and on and on and on...  I don't think it would make a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would not say, and I did not say, that people shouldn't invest their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energies in advancing the singularity consciously.  You are right that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly a lot of worse ways to find meaning in life.  I simply wanted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know why Eliezer thought - or seemed to think if I understand him aright -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it somehow would not happen without his project, or that humanity was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somehow headed for disaster if his project didn't succeed.
</em><br>
<p>Awhile back when I was active (year+ ago) I had many rounds with Eliezer 
<br>
about his vision of the Singularity.  At least back then he very strongly 
<br>
believed that if *his* version of the Singularity was not implemented that 
<br>
we were doomed.  Personally, I don't quite agree (we actually had several 
<br>
major issues of disagreement about what the Singularity should 
<br>
be/produce).  Although our chances of survival as a species improve 
<br>
drastically with the creation of a &quot;good&quot; Singularity.  If we don't develop 
<br>
a breakthrough technology, though, I do think we will eventually (within a 
<br>
few centuries at most) cease to exist.
<br>
<p>I also tend to believe that the Singularity is inevitable (barring 
<br>
catastrophe) in some form or another.  Once you create an intelligent 
<br>
process that can do the job of the engineers who currently advance 
<br>
processing speed your mostly there.  And that will most likely happen, if 
<br>
nothing else, by a major corporation due to ROI once obviously feasible.  I 
<br>
mean, why use human engineers who you have to pay, who sleep, only work 
<br>
60hrs/week, etc. when you could replace them with intelligent 
<br>
software?  No-brainier decision there.  And as soon as you have the 
<br>
entities responsible for creating the advances directly tied to the 
<br>
advances (so that advances in the technology directly reduce the 
<br>
development time) you, more or less, get singularity rather quickly (few 
<br>
years at most).  The nature of that singularity is greatly uncertain, however.
<br>
<p>Having thought about the issue, I don't think that anything less than 
<br>
MASSIVE additional effort will have much effect at this stage, however.  We 
<br>
are too far off and most of what needs to be done right now is basic 
<br>
research.  And people much more qualified than myself (such as Ben 
<br>
Goertzel) are working on that.  In 5-10 years the technology will be much 
<br>
closer to what will be required and our basic understanding of Artificial 
<br>
Intelligence and other required technologies will be (hopefully much) 
<br>
better.  At that point additional effort will have much, much more effect 
<br>
than it would now.  So, personally, I'm not working on anything directly 
<br>
related to the Singularity (although some of the technologies I'm 
<br>
developing may some day help).  I think a better approach is to be 
<br>
successful and attempt to make a whole bunch of money (gotta love 
<br>
capitalism).  Then, when things get closer hopefully I'll be in a great 
<br>
position to assist.  Here is the way I look at it.
<br>
<p>Let's assume I'm a god of Software Development.  As such I'm highly 
<br>
creative, intelligent, knowledgeable, efficient and produce excellent code 
<br>
in incredibly short periods of time.  Thus I'm incredibly valuable!  (I 
<br>
only wish all that was true...)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  I devote all my time to developing the Singularity right 
<br>
away.  I spend the next 10 years doing mostly basic research to enable the 
<br>
Singularity.  Ten years from now, once everything is ready to begin 
<br>
development of the Singularity in earnest, I work on that.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  I devote the next 10 years to other projects, with the primary 
<br>
goal of becoming independent and expanding my knowledgeable.  A sub-goal 
<br>
(with fairly high priority) is to make lots of money (millions+).  I'm a 
<br>
god (remember?) so let's assume I succeed and 10 years from now I'm worth 
<br>
$50 million.  The basic research required for the Singularity has been 
<br>
completed (by others such as Ben) and development is ready to begin.  So I 
<br>
buy a small office building (which has good security), hire a team of the 
<br>
best &amp; brightest engineers available and devote all that collected efforts 
<br>
to developing the Singularity (hopefully in direct cooperation with some of 
<br>
the experts).
<br>
<p>Which route do you think would have the most long-term effect?  I'm betting 
<br>
on #2, even though I'm not a god and only have a moderate shot of making 
<br>
millions.  Even if I don't get rich the added effort right now wouldn't 
<br>
have much effect anyway (IMHO)...
