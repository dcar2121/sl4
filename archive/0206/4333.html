</em><br>
<p>I am absolutely positive that Eliezer agrees with you on this... else why
<br>
would he have published his Friendly AI theories on the web?  He obviously
<br>
*wants* &quot;the brightest people&quot; to read and blast holes in his stuff, if they
<br>
can.  And to a certain extent this has happened (bright people have read it)
<br>
and comments have been offerred.  I don't think that a &quot;thousand&quot; of the
<br>
brightest have read it.. but how would we get those kinds of people to spend
<br>
the time to do a thourough job?  Got any ideas?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Letting your ego prod you to go it mostly alone is insane given the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yep.  That is why there is the Singularity Institute.  Eliezer talks
<br>
confidently, but I don't see him as acting *over* confidently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hell, if I had to give the answer to &quot;623 + 377&quot; but giving the wrong
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; before answering!  And if even one of them was different I'd get 20 more,
</em><br>
etc.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Good for you! (and for us).
