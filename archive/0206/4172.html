<p>Well, obviously we agree that the upload *should* work on it/his/her 
<br>
self.  Will she agree to that?
<br>
<p>What about the very first change the upload makes which lowers her own 
<br>
intelligence?  Will she know the difference?  Would you?  Many people think 
<br>
they are as cognitively capable when drunk as when sober, but they 
<br>
aren't.  However, having been drunk, it is very difficult to judge for 
<br>
yourself (unless your VERY drunk, obviously).  How could you/she tell which 
<br>
changes were improvements?  What if the improvements added subtle deficits 
<br>
that were not readily obvious?  I believe this would be very slow 
<br>
going.  Over time you would make progress and the pace of progress would 
<br>
gradually improve.  It would likely take major improvement, however, to get 
<br>
to the point that she was capable of creating substantial progress on her 
<br>
own.  For quite some time she would just be one more mind working on the 
<br>
project.

The best way I can see to make rapid progress, if that is your goal, would 
be to have numerous copies of the AI running (lets say 10).  Each AI runs 
on equivalent hardware and is cloned (copied) from one original source 
(thus are identical at the instant of copy).
Start off by working on the problem with you staff + the 10 AIs (maybe 
equivalent to 30+ additional staff members).  Get proposals on tweaks to 
make in order to improve intelligence.  Pick 5, stop the AIs, copy one to 
all hardware, implement each change on 2 AIs, restart the AIs.  Give all of 
them the exact same input and run them though a series of mental 
exercises/tests.  Record their answers (maybe letting them pick several 
answers for each question and having them rank them) along with the time 
required to answer.  Once finished discuss the results (include the AIs I 
would imagine).  Determine which change made the best improvement.  At this 
point you have 2 options:
         1.  Implement the change to all 10 AIs (possibly undoing their 
previous modification and/or re cloning them).
         2.  Leave them as is
Repeat the process and pick 5 more changes to try.
---
The above process should produce positive progress fairly quickly.  As the 
AIs become smarter they will usually be suggesting the best ideas to 
try.  Coming up with mental exercises will become difficult as they get 
smarter.  One possibility is to have them devise the exercises, giving it 
significant thought.  Then, when cloning them, go back to a state before 
they created the exercises.
Actually, this has another significant benefit.  This method would keep the 
human creators in the loop (and in charge) for some time.  Which could be 
used as an effective delay/slowdown if desired.  It would also place them 
in a reasonable position to monitor and gauge progress.  Allowing them to 
make their own tweaks and, if necessary, pull the plug quite easily.
One obvious down side, however, is that you could be seen as killing 9 
sentient intelligences with every cloning operation (since you effectively 
delete 9 of them).
