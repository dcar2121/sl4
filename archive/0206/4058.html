<p><p>Rational?  By what measure?  How is attachment to the well-being

of ourselves and all like us irrational?  Whether we transform 
<br>
or simply cease to exist seems to me to be a perfectly rational 
<br>
thing to be a bit concerned about.  Do you see it otherwise?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I and others have broken this attachment to keep it from

<p><p><em>&gt;It is the result of being genetically related to

</em><br>
<p><p>I do not necesarily agree that we can just write it off as a 
<br>
genetic relatedness issue at all.  Whether there is sentient 
<br>
life and whether it continues, regardless of its form, is of 
<br>
intense interest to me.  That some forms are not genetically 
<br>
related is not of high relevance to the form of my concern. So 
<br>
please don't assume that explains it away or makes the issue go 
<br>
away.  It doesn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This kind of thinking, usually, is good because it keeps the average 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>If it makes it one whit more likely that the existing sentients 
<br>
survive on, perhaps in a transformed manner, then it is a very 
<br>
good thing.

<p><p>How do you come to this conclusion?  What makes the SI worth 
<br>
more than all of humanity?  That it can outperform them on some 
<br>
types of computation?  Is computational complexity and speed the 
<br>
sole measure of whether sentient beings have the right to 
<br>
continued existence?  Can you really give a moral justification 
<br>
or a rational one for this?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; self aware, do present more of an ethical delima than cows if it turns

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>How kind of you.  However, from the above it seems you see them 
<br>
as an ethical dilemna greater than that of cows but if your SI, 
<br>
whatever it turns out really to be, seems to require or decides 
<br>
the death of one or all of them, then you would have to side 
<br>
with the SI.
<br>
<p>Do I read you correctly?  If I do, then why do you hold this 
<br>
position?  If I read you correctly then how can you expect the 
<br>
majority of human beings, if they really understood you, to 
<br>
consider you as other than a monster?
<br>
<p>My own view of the Singularity and all steps up to it is to 
<br>
transform this world and all its sentient beings possible to a 
<br>
much more promising form of existence.  How much of the 
<br>
incomprehnsible post-Singularity possibilities are claimed is 
<br>
dependent on many things but especially on the wishes of the 
<br>
individual sentient.  They will claim different possibilities as 
<br>
they are ready.  No sentient, no matter how powerful, has the 
<br>
right to deprive them of existence entirely or of their choices. 
<br>
I don't believe any less than this gives a decent basis for what 
<br>
we are attempting to do or ends up with a world/universe that I 
<br>
would want any part of creating or inhabiting.  We have the 
<br>
power to re-create ourselves, this world and an unknown amount 
<br>
more.  How will we use it?  Will we just create an SI and leave 
<br>
it up to it to do whatever it wishes with us slightly more 
<br>
problematic than cows beings?
