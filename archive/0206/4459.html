<p>Hey, I'm always open to changing my point of view given good reason to do 
<br>
so (which I belive I've demonstrated at least a few times on here).  I 
<br>
never said it had to be this way, and Ben's suggestions (which were not in 
<br>
this vein) are the ones I ended up agreeing with.
<br>
<p>Also, please note, that the above viewpoint was in fact specifically 
<br>
because of your recent posting behavior Eliezer.  Your making me nervous, 
<br>
for darn good and I believe obvious reason.  And I'm obviously not the only 
<br>
one, I've gotten a number of private emails from SL4 participants in the 
<br>
last couple of days thanking me for confronting you on these issues, and 
<br>
asking that I continue to do the same.  Thus, my original pitch for this 
<br>
group WAS actually intended to get in your way, Eliezer.  A fact you 
<br>
obviously picked up on because you reacted so strongly against this 
<br>
emotionally, instead of giving rational arguments why it was not necessary 
<br>
(which would have been the wiser response, IMHO).
<br>
<p>I would tend to worry very little if Ben was about to kick off a 
<br>
Singularity attempt, but I would worry very much if you, Eliezer, were.  If 
<br>
you don't understand why I suggest you carefully re-read many of your 
<br>
recent posts and have some trusted friends, who can be completely honest 
<br>
with you, do the same.  You do have, I assume, trusted friends of this 
<br>
nature (although you very well may not since your focusing so much energy 
<br>
on getting to the Singularity ASAP).
