I think I failed to send the following message on Sunday but in case you
<br>
have already seen it, please accept my apologies.

<br>
<p>I do not consider a soft Singularity to be any less scary than a hard
<br>
Singularity.  I think this is wishful thinking.
<br>
<p>### I think a slow Singularity would be inherently safer, if it were to
<br>
occur (you *can* send troops, dismantle the internet, use nuclear weapons,
<br>
etc. to stop it if you think it's goin bad). However, I do agree with you
<br>
that it is most likely wishful thinking that the &quot;natural&quot; way for
<br>
superintelligent self-enhancement will be slow.
<br>
<p>Once a human-level AI exists, it can be copied and will work 24/7 on
<br>
self-enhancement - and it should be able to squeeze a lot more performance
<br>
out of existing hardware simply by virtue of its inhuman persistence and
<br>
cooperation among copies equivalent to a large team of top-flight
<br>
programmers. This should be enough to start a positive feedback.  
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>I would call it dead certain in favor of a hard takeoff, unless all the
<br>
intelligences at the core of that hard takeoff unanimously decide otherwise.
<br>
<p>### I do not share this certainty, but then you are the better informed
<br>
person. However, I'd like to posit the following objection - what if there
<br>
are some natural-law-type limits to the total problem-solving ability that
<br>
can be controlled by a single self-aware unit? There are limits to the size
<br>
of dinosaur, not apparent when you are building a mouse. The SI *could* find
<br>
itself limited by the sheer complexity of the processing needed to produce
<br>
aditional growth. BTW, I find it quite useless to speak of AI's 1000 or 1000
<br>
000 times smarter than humans, as some writers like to do, without a clearly
<br>
defined metric of what it means. We shouldn't forget that even among humans
<br>
with our relatively small differences in intelligence it is quite difficult
<br>
to provide standards, except for statistically based tools like the IQ.
<br>
<p>Another foible is believing that decisions humans make today regarding SAI
<br>
will substantionally shape reality over the next couple billion years. Most
<br>
likely the only long-term results will be similar in importance to the
<br>
cosmic microwave background - small ripples on the surface of reality. The
<br>
laws inherent in the evolution of intelligence will provide the bulk of the
<br>
sructure, no matter what we do.
<br>
<p><p>Another objection is that an human-level AI alone would be hugely effective,
<br>
but still easily controllable by humans - it might be able to work out the
<br>
basics of uploading without being an independent moral philosopher. I
<br>
understand that there would be some risks - a human-level AI with millions
<br>
of copies running in computers all over the world (as would be needed to
<br>
solve our problems) would be an SAI just waiting to happen. To reliably
<br>
prevent the copies from being modified by hackers and started on the
<br>
self-enhancement pathway might be difficult if not impossible. This is why,
<br>
all in all, I tend to agree with your approach - trying to get over the
<br>
human-level AI ASAP, while preserving friendliness not corruptible by human
<br>
influences. I am not dead certain though, it's more like a good hunch with
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>I would say that the Singularity &quot;wants&quot; to be hard; the difficulty of
<br>
keeping it soft would increase asymptotically the farther you got, and I see
<br>
very little point in trying.
<br>
<p>### Yes, I agree, but not quite - the difficulty of keeping the Singularity
<br>
slow would be enormous right at the beginning, at the level of human-level
<br>
AI (as I wrote above). Once you get to the level where humans have no direct
<br>
input, you might, paradoxically, be able to slow down - a Friendly AI might
<br>
realize that further growth in certain directions will damage Friendliness,
<br>
or the FAI encounters fundamental moral dilemmas which can be only addressed
<br>
by superhuman intelligences with preservation of the principle of autonomy,
<br>
so that the AI is morally constrained from making the decisions for us. The
<br>
FAI would then stop its enhancement, until enough humans could reach the
<br>
AI's level and provide guidance. Since malicious hackers would not be able
<br>
to change the AI's mind by direct meddling with code, such a decision have
<br>
the force of the law (and the FAI would stop any independent AI work, at all
<br>
levels). If the slow Singularity is better for us, your FAI will tell us
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Indeed, one of the crucial elements of stable Friendliness will be the
<br>
ability to predict moral challenges in advance, and adjust development
<br>
accordingly. I think you did address this issue in the CFAI.
