<p>Yes. However, I do not trust my judgement in this sufficiently, orelse I
<br>
wouldn't be here reading this forum. Most normal people think we all here
<br>
are engaged in massive mental masturbation. They're probably right, but 
<br>
conventional risk assement breaks down here. (Plus, our time is exactly 
<br>
ours to waste, right?).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; b) the gov'ts of the developed world will have instituted a surveillance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that has its feelers in every computer chip of any reasonable power,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and every network hub, etc.  Maybe even in every brain!  AGI research will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be allowed only in gov't regulated facilities, and if the surveillance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system sees anyone doing unapproved AGI research, the gov't will step in and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squash it.
</em><br>
<p>This is a possible future. We've got several independent forces working
<br>
towards that. First, spooks need no extra incentive to snoop. It's their
<br>
business, and bureaucracies, emulating ideal gas, tend to expand to fill
<br>
all available room, if unopposed. So far, we don't see much backpressure
<br>
rising up from the grass roots. The matter is a bit technical, and people,
<br>
if not overworked, are too busy partying to notice. Though a possibility,
<br>
I personally tend to disbelieve the aura of overworked imcompetence the
<br>
diverse TLA agencies are projecting. Psyops ain't that hard, and I kinda
<br>
doubt the suddenly lost all capabilities in that respect, which were
<br>
rather well developed.
<br>
<p>So the feds world-wide are pushing for more surveillance on the networks.
<br>
<p>Secondly, the content and copyright owners (lately, Redmond is expanding
<br>
into content provider role, and shifts stragies) are trying to make you
<br>
paying for the hardware which keeps you from owning and using content you
<br>
paid for. Coincidentally, diverse Blut und Bod.., excuse me, Homeland
<br>
Securitate czars love this, because this recent rehash of the tired
<br>
Trusted Platform is key escrow in disguise.
<br>
<p>Certain people who recently caused a collapse of twin buildings of certain
<br>
symbolic value and occupied by high-octane businesses, plus some random
<br>
federal employee busybody mailing B. anthracis spores in badly sealed
<br>
envelopes, or random wackos planned nerve gas attacks on the EU
<br>
parliament, greatly assisted the feds worldwide in their unprecedented
<br>
grab for power. (Whoever did it on which payroll is irrelevant, useful
<br>
idiots are useful idiots).
<br>
<p>So even before Singularity seed AI research is classified as terrorism,
<br>
we've got a definite tendency on our hands. For those, who've been asleep
<br>
at the wheel long enough to miss the trend, and ask for evidence, can
<br>
browse the following news clipping over a relatively short observation
<br>
window:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://cypherpunks.dhs.org/cpunx-news/">http://cypherpunks.dhs.org/cpunx-news/</a>
<br>
<p>(no, it's no longer hosted at yahoogroups).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think this is a *possible* future, I just don't think it's a likely one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For one thing, unless we have world gov't, what's going to stop &quot;rogue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations&quot; from developing their own AGI as part of their own defense/offense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts?  To assume a safe future ensured by regulation, you effectively
</em><br>
<p>Armageddon devices are not exactly weapons, not in the classical sense
<br>
(Dr. Strangelove, we really don't want to hear your objections). I don't
<br>
subscribe to the &quot;rogue nations&quot; rhetoric, but clearly the high threshold
<br>
of development indicates the grain size and competence required does make
<br>
for a rather short list of countries in which it could probably happen
<br>
(corrected for several decades downstream).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; have to assume a world gov't, otherwise, your future is going to include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of AGI arms race, which in my view is pretty darn dangerous.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's *more* dangerous than a world where AGI is developed by industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or maverick scientists... others may disagree.)
</em><br>
<p>I personally don't think the user experience is going to be all that 
<br>
different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the future you describe is unlikely even if your pessimistic stance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the pace of AGI development is wrong.  But it's not an unthinkable or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous prognostication; of course, predicting the future is not easy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially in times of such rapid change...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I see a number of people talking deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engineering hubris in face of the mothers of high-complexity efforts with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the highest impact imaginable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I can accept this characterization.  I have &quot;deep engineering hubris.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I kinda like the phrase, actually.  Someone should use it to title a band,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or at least a CD... not a techno CD, that would be too obvious; maybe some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retro early 80's hardcore ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure the candy ravers will take much notice.
