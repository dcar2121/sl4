<em>&gt; You 've got an interesting measure for achievement ;) It is

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Of course, there is no fully objective way to measure &amp; compare amounts of
<br>
achievement.  Einstein is more famous than von Neumann because he made a few
<br>
really crisp important discoveries, whereas von Neumann's discoveries were
<br>
more diffuse.  [Godel's Theorem is an example of an Einstein-like &quot;crisp
<br>
important discovery&quot; in the math/CS rather than physics domain...]
<br>
<p><p>The point I was making, though, is that
<br>
<p>1) von Neumann seems based on all reports to have had more of the surface
<br>
signs of &quot;super high intelligence&quot; than Einstein.  He was a lightning
<br>
calculator, mastered new areas of science immediately, could speak with
<br>
great precision and complexity and insight on nearly any topic, etc.
<br>
<p>2) Einstein was in my view (and the general view) at least as &quot;great a
<br>
thinker&quot; as von Neumann, maybe (as is the general consensus) greater
<br>
<p>I've seen similar phenomena in my own experience.
<br>
<p>For instance, Jeff Pressing, a friend who recently passed away prematurely,
<br>
was just an AMAZINGLY smart guy.  He spoke a dozen languages, could play 10
<br>
people simultaneously at chess while blindfolded (and quite well), could
<br>
solve really tough differential equations in his head rapidly, was a master
<br>
of several instruments and extremely good at nearly all the others (not only
<br>
orchestral instruments but West African drums of various sorts, etc. etc.).
<br>
Sometimes it scared me how smart this guy was.  Yet as a scientist he was
<br>
merely *very good*.  I've met other scientists who didn't seem &quot;as
<br>
intelligent&quot; as Jeff yet had accomplished significantly more in terms of
<br>
scientific discovery.
<br>
<p>In our own collaborations, we worked together quite well -- although I'm
<br>
*very quick* with math &amp; logical reasoning, he was even quicker and
<br>
considerably less error-prone; but I was always the one who came up with the
<br>
out-there, sometimes-kooky, sometimes-excellent ideas that kicked our
<br>
research projects off....
<br>
<p><p><p>One thing this kind of observation teaches us is that the notion of
<br>
intelligence is really very subtle and multidimensional.
<br>
<p>Of course, AI has taught us that already, in a different way -- what with
<br>
Deep Blue, Mathematica, and so forth.  No doubt the advent of AGI's will
<br>
teach us all sorts of freaky things about the possible varieties of
<br>
intelligence...
