<em>&gt;How many bits do you need to describe a baby? (Remeber, not the zygote. A

</em><br>
<p>Why does it matter?  How many bits does it take to fully describe a 
<br>
toaster?  We are NOT trying to recreate a human baby, we are trying to 
<br>
create an Artificial Intelligence.  One that, in fact, may end up thinking 
<br>
and working in much different ways than human minds do.  Thus the 
<br>
complexity of a baby (which is pointless anyway since the heart, liver, 
<br>
toes, etc. are irrelevant) or any other living thing is irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; complexity of the world, however, is completely irrelevant to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem (since we're not trying to create an Artificial World, just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; single Artificial Intelligence that would exist in it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What I'm saying is that an AI has to have a large fraction of the world to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;is dirty, and complex, the resulting architecture is that, too. The vessel
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Also very much not true.  If the AI only understood math but could learn 
<br>
and actually invent new knowledge in that domain would it not be 
<br>
Intelligent?  Why would it have to know about cars, hamsters, pizza or the 
<br>
like to succeed?
<br>
<p>Also, an engineering solution NEVER has to be dirty and complex in order to 
<br>
solve a dirty &amp; complex problem.  An inelegant solution will produce less 
<br>
than reasonable performance and/or won't be flexible.  Thus a successful AI 
<br>
implementation will almost certainly be elegant, otherwise it would require 
<br>
substantially more resources (computing power, memory, etc) or get stuck in 
<br>
a rut shortly after leaving the gate.  And thus would be beat to the punch 
<br>
by the first elegant implementation to surface.
