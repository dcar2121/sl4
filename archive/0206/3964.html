<p>But don't forget, 100 years ago theoretical physics also looked like it

was pretty much dead.  Everything was understood, more or less.  Then 
<br>
along comes general relativity and quantum mechanics.  Oops, guess there 
<br>
was some stuff we didn't know.  I'm sure any TOE we come up with will be 
<br>
stubbed by new discoveries.  And, if we can't find any, then we'll just 
<br>
have to create a new universe and start playing with that.  :-)

<p><em>&gt; The elimination of death, disease, disability, and infirmity.

<p>Well, we're likely to see further extended life spans, but the end of 
<br>
people being physically troubled is not near (unless the Singularity 
<br>
happens this evening).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Space exploration.
</em><br>
<p>Due to cost limitations, unless the private sector gets its act together 
<br>
I don't think we can expect to see much in the way of space 
<br>
exploration.  The except would be if the Chinese pump a lot of money 
<br>
into their space program, in which case we'll have another Space Race 
<br>
with the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What have I left out?
</em><br>
<p>Probably lots of things that no one sees coming.  The future's often 
<br>
full of surprises because no one was really looking in the right 
<br>
direction.
