</em><br>
<p>Why?  The debate needs some grounding.  When there are proposals 
<br>
afloat to have the FAI be developed by military and under orders 
<br>
from the Commander in Chief it is very important to look at what 
<br>
that can mean in very real life terms starting precisely from 
<br>
where we are.  Anyone that would not be scaried given the 
<br>
current situations and proclivities of such deployment and 
<br>
control of SAI is in my opinion vastly disconnected from reality 
<br>
- quite dangerously so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides, most views of a political figure's actual morals, based solely 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; That includes my views on political figures I dislike as well.  If the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in a forum such as this for many months before making any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal judgements about their morals (of course this would never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen - though).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>All I need to do is look at the public figure's public actions 
<br>
and statements to decide what I think of them qua public figure 
<br>
and how much of a danger I believe they represent.  The stated 
<br>
endless War plans of the current administration are more than 
<br>
sufficient to gauge the advisability of having any real AI owned 
<br>
by the military or the government
