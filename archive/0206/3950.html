I would phrase it this way, instead.
<br>
<p>Given a set of *basic goals*, rational *subgoals* are those that result from
<br>
the basic goals by some logical thought process.
<br>
<p>An organism's basic goals are not logically derived, at least not in
<br>
biological organisms.  They are part of an organism's evolutionary
<br>
birthright, modulo mutations.  They may be considered partially &quot;logically
<br>
derived&quot; via the logic of evolution, but there's a lot of
<br>
non-selection-based self-organizationg going on here too, in my view.
<br>
<p>In the future, goals may be logically derived in a different sense.  An AI
<br>
may create new goals for itself, based on its previous goals among other
<br>
things.  (For instance, uploaded-Ben might decide to remove &quot;personal
<br>
survival&quot; as an important goal for itself, thus radically altering its goal
<br>
system.)  This process of iterative basic-goal-revision depends on initial
<br>
conditions in a way we don't yet understand.  Maybe the trajectory thru
<br>
basic-goal-space depends sensitively on the initial condition, or MAYBE no
<br>
matter what the in initial condition, the system will eventually converge on
<br>
a small handful of &quot;fixed point&quot; basic goal systems G with the property &quot;A
<br>
system with basic goal system G, when revising itself, will preserve basic
<br>
goal system G.&quot;  Eliezer's hypothesis is that the Friendliness goal system
<br>
is a fixed point basic goal system in this sense.
<br>

<p><p><p><em>&gt; Rational goals are those that result from some logical thought process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example (highly simplified):  Eliezer sees the Singularity coming;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer sees that the Singularity could potentially wipe out everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and everything if it goes slightly wrong; ergo, Eliezer dedicates his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life to creating a safe Singularity.  Irrational thinking would be if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer had thought like this:  Eliezer sees the Singularity coming;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer sees that the Singularity could potentially wipe out everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and everything if it goes slightly wrong; Eliezer sees an attractive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woman; Eliezer goes off with the woman and lets the Singularity be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hobby.  Even worse, he might have rationalized:  Eliezer goes off with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the woman because he thinks that this experience will help him create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safer Singularity.  Without the right set of qualifiers on the woman,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he'll be thinking this because his brain is tricking him into doing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wants, i.e. reproducing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rational goals don't just come out of no where, they follow logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from your knowledge.  Irrational goals don't follow logically and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably seem to come up out of nowhere (oh, I think I'd like vanilla
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ice cream today!).
