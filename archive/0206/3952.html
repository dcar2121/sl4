<p><p>Ben replied:
<br>
I never do find it necessary to assume that a material, logically
<br>
consistent, objective reality exists, no.
<br>
<p>I assume that
<br>
<p>1) my subjective reality has certain properties of persistence and
<br>
consistency over time
<br>
<p>2) this subjective reality of mine has other beings in it (e.g. my
<br>
collaborators) whom I can usefully modeled as if *they* have their own
<br>
subjective realities, which intersect substantially with mine (though not
<br>
necessarily agreeing with  mine precisely).
<br>
<p>These are the minimal pragmatic assumptions I need to make to proceed with
<br>
my life, so they are the assumptions I habitually make.
<br>
<p>And this is not just abstract mumbo-jumbo -- this is *really* how I
<br>
feel/think about the world.  It seems to serve me OK.
<br>
<p>Is this identical to what you mean by assuming a &quot;material, logically
<br>
consistent objective reality.&quot;  I don't think so....
<br>
<p>But nor is it identical to nihilistically assuming nothing at all.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p>Thanks for clearing that up! As you said Ben, your assumptions are not
<br>
identical to what I mean by a material, logically consistent objective
<br>
reality. In practice though, I don't think they are inconsistent with my
<br>
meaning either if one judges by the effects of our respective assumptions
<br>
about reality (subjective or objective) have on individual behavior.
<br>
<p>The way you function in the world is not inconsistent with there being a
<br>
material, logically consistent objective reality. You merely choose not to
<br>
make the assumption that there is such a thing. But neither do you
<br>
&quot;nihilistically assum[e] nothing at all.&quot; So, to me, our respective
<br>
assumptions about reality amount to personal preferences that affect nothing
<br>
in the world except our opinions about. It seems to me that your assumption
<br>
about your subjective reality exhibiting &quot;persistence and consistency over
<br>
time&quot; yields the same operational behaviors on your part as the assumption
<br>
that reality of whatever flavor is law-bound, logical and unaffected our
<br>
wishes about it except insofar as wishes lead to action.
<br>
