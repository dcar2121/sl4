<p>No, but that is a very difficult problem though.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can we write secure systems? No.
</em><br>
<p>No but we can write more easily systems that have good security.  Both
<br>
Java and C# have very decent security system build in.  The use of
<br>
objects for buffers and strings really helps to eliminate most of the
<br>
common sources of buffer overruns.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>

</em><br>
<p>Java and C# can fail much more gracefully than a C or C++ system can.
<br>
Every error now throws a well defined exception.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can we generate code to specs automatically? No.
</em><br>
<p>Case systems are difficult.

<p><em>&gt; Can we design massively

</em><br>
<p>Writing distributed systems is much easier today that it was in the
<br>
past.  I wrote a distributed application yesterday from start to finish.

<p>Hmm... I do not understand what you mean.
