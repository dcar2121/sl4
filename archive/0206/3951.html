hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Elsewhere I thought that you wrote (but perhaps it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else) that we could all be talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same thing, but using different terms (and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different concepts).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that was me
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, it should be possible even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting from a solipsist POV that having a *model* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an objective reality would be very practical, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly could not be dismissed out of hand as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, this model can be useful.  On the other hand, it can sometimes be
<br>
counterproductive.  When interacting with people who have very different
<br>
approaches to life, or who come from very different cultures, it can be more
<br>
useful sometimes to assume that reality is subjective and there are
<br>
multiple, sometimes-overlapping realities.
<br>
<p>In science, the &quot;single objective reality&quot; model is pretty useful.  In
<br>
personal life, I find it less so.  In quantum physics, its utility is
<br>
certainly debatable (it's been much debated by pretty smart people, without
<br>
a firm conclusion).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Specifically, where do you find fault with the conjecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is a material universe &quot;out there&quot; and that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are evolved creatures within it?
</em><br>
<p>It's a useful hypothesis, which I find valuable sometimes.
<br>
<p>It doesn't explain to me very well what I experience while deeply
<br>
meditating, or what I experienced in the past while tripping on LSD or
<br>
mushrooms.  At those times, I found/find other hypotheses more useful.
<br>
<p>Of course, from the realist perspective, meditation or psychedelics just
<br>
cause you to experience certain illusions thru affecting your
<br>
neurochemistry.
<br>
<p>But from the relativist, mystical perspective, empirical reality is just a
<br>
kind of &quot;autopoietic system&quot;, a kind of self-referential attractor that
<br>
holds itself together, without any more &quot;fundamental reality&quot; than any other
<br>
illusion -- just with a higher degree of cohesion and persistence...
<br>
<p>I find each of these views valuable in different ways, and I particularly
<br>
enjoy maintaining them both at the same time ;)
<br>
<p>But, I am a weird dude, what can I say...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is elementary stuff, but realist philosophers don't seem to get it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Realist philosophers going all the way back to J. J. C. Smart have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealt quite adequately with hypotheses that our brains are in vats.
</em><br>
<p>I read a lot of that stuff 12-15 years ago, but I was never convinced....
<br>
My memory of it is fuzzy though.  If you'd like to refresh my memory with a
<br>
couple paragraphs, I wouldn't mind....  I do remember reading an awful lot
<br>
of tedious philosophy papers about brains in vats, that's for sure!
<br>
<p>Philosophically, I consider myself a &quot;pragmatist&quot; in the sense of Charles S.
<br>
Peirce (e.g. volume 8 of his collected works, &quot;Scientific Metaphysics&quot;).  I
<br>
don't agree with everything Peirce said, but most of it.  I am also pretty
<br>
sympathetic to the late philosophy of Nietzsche, e.g. Book III of the &quot;Will
<br>
to Power&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight of the Idols.&quot;
<br>
<p>Finally, I'll reiterate that, while I find philosophy both fun and
<br>
intellect-strengthening, I don't take it all that seriously.  It often does
<br>
strike me as a bunch of word-play, in the late-Wittgensteinian sense.
<br>
Remember, Wittgenstein's main point in his late work was to convince people
<br>
not to bother to do philosophy, because it was mostly just quasi-meaningless
<br>
playing with words.  He failed in his mission of course, his work has merely
<br>
served to stimulate more and more philosophy papers ;-&gt;
