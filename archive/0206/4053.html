</em><br>
<p>First off, let's define &quot;attachment&quot; and how it differs from a rational
<br>
decision that something is desirable.  I happen to feel that BJKlein has an 
<br>
irrational fear of death because BJKlein says he cannot conceive of it being 
<br>
reasonable for anyone, even an altruist, to sacrifice their own life so that 
<br>
ten others may live.  Death is &quot;not an option&quot;.  This, to me, indicates that 
<br>
BJKlein is processing death as emotionally unbearable rather than rationally 
<br>
undesirable.  I judge that my death is intrinsically undesirable.  But it is 
<br>
not irrational to make that judgement while simultaneously judging that the 
<br>
death of ten other people is ten times as intrinsically undesirable. 
<br>
However, if one's thoughts are motivated by an existential horror of 
<br>
personal nonexistence rather than a sentient-symmetrical judgement that 
<br>
death is evil, the rational decision to sacrifice your own life may be an 
<br>
emotional impossibility.  This is why I would call &quot;attachment&quot; irrational - 
<br>
because it acts as a constraint on the set of possible thoughts, and may 
<br>
cause you to make judgements that are incompatible with your professed 
<br>
principles.
<br>
<p>If something is rationally undesirable it may still be less undesirable than 
<br>
some even worse alternative; if something is rationally desirable there may 
<br>
still be more desirable things.
<br>
<p>As with continued life, one becomes &quot;attached&quot; to humanity - as opposed to 
<br>
being a rational defender of humanity's continued existence, which I judge 
<br>
to be a great good - at the point where it becomes *inconceivable* that 
<br>
something more valuable than humanity could exist.  It would be a horror if 
<br>
humanity were exterminated.  If two other sentient species were exterminated 
<br>
that would be twice as horrible.  If given a choice between the destruction 
<br>
of Earth and the destruction of ten other planets on which reside roughly 
<br>
equivalent sentient species (with roughly equivalent chances at the 
<br>
Singularity), I would choose the destruction of Earth.
