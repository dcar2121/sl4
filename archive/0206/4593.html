<p>6 months for me was like the bare minimum needed to allow everyone to
<br>
pick through your plans. Actually I'd prefer it be a longer period than
<br>
that. What does your common sense tell you? Do you have a time period in
<br>
mind?

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; AI going rogue at sometime in the far future is pretty damn small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What I'd really like the experts for is to help arrive at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; .01% figure in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the first place, actually...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So at this point, you can't answer my question? I guess it is one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things best left to the heat of the moment :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What would your answer be, if the same question were aimed at you regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own Ai project?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And once you tell me your answer, why should I believe you?
</em><br>
<p>Clearly, coming up with better ways to measure these risks and make
<br>
decisions upon the measurements is something we all still need to work on.
<br>
<p>I think if I was presented with such a figure, I would also want to compare
<br>
it to a bunch of humans that had been similarly tested. If the figure for
<br>
the AI was significantly less risky than the humans, then I would argue
<br>
pulling the plug makes no sense. If the AI was higher than any of the
<br>
humans then I would either pull the plug or if possible work on revising
<br>
the AI to lower the risks further.
<br>
<p>I think SIAI is trustable on this since we have been the leaders when it
<br>
comes to these issues, when it comes to stressing lowering risks, and
<br>
when it comes to publicly publishing our plans and discussing them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; A consensus among a large committee of individualists is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plausibly going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to be achieved on *any* nontrivial issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What if they did?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a diverse committee of transhumanist-minded individuals agreed that going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead with a Novamente-lauchned singularity was a very bad idea, then, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Unless there was some weird extenuating circumstance, like all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committee members being brainwashed, or paid off, etc.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, this is not the same as your last question.  Because a diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committee of transhumanist-minded individuals would be incredibly unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say &quot;The .01% chance we have calculated that your AI will go rogue at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some point in the far future is too much in our opinion. Pull the plug.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This statement bespeaks a lack of appreciation of the possibility that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human race will destroy itself *on any given day* via nuclear or biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare, etc.  It is not at all the kind of statement one would expect from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a set of Singularity wizards, now is it?
</em><br>
<p>Right, we need some way to compare between them all.
