Hi Stephen,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As miltary ethics are somewhat codified I believe a military AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may in fact be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *more* desirable case for AGI development.  Again this is said from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint of one who trusts the US military and who supports our current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missions.
</em><br>
<p>Oh man this is a scary day of e-mails!!!
<br>
<p>First we have Eli, who thinks that whomever can build an AGI is
<br>
intrinsically possessed with tremendous wisdom...
<br>
<p>And now, this assertion that the US military should be trusted with AGI and
<br>
the Singularity...
<br>
<p>My Singularity optimism is rapidly getting the jitters!  Eugen, maybe you're
<br>
right.... (Just kidding -- partly...)
<br>
<p>I don't doubt that there are many trustworthy, moral individuals within the
<br>
US  military.  However, I do not trust the US military as an organization,
<br>
no way Jose'.  This is the crew that invaded Grenada... the organization
<br>
that nuked Japan (probably both bombs were needless, but it's pretty damn
<br>
clear the second one was), that systematically tortured Vietnamese women and
<br>
children in the name of democracy and justice....  I'll spare you a full
<br>
list of examples.  Ever read the first-person account of how US soldiers
<br>
chopped off the arms and legs of a Vietnamese woman, inserted dynamite in
<br>
her vagina and blew her up?  Not an outlier occurence.  Excuse me if the
<br>
impeccable morality of the US military seems a little questionable to me...
<br>
<p>Yeah, the US military has done some good (I didn't like the Taliban either).
<br>
And some evil.  And the people who run it are charged with protecting the
<br>
interests of the USA (the military and ECONOMIC interests, as history amply
<br>
shows), not with promoting the general good of the human race.  If a
<br>
Singularity is gonna lead to the greater general good for sentient life, but
<br>
may lead to the dissolution of the US as an entity and the consequent
<br>
meaninglessness of the US military and ranks like &quot;general&quot; and &quot;admiral&quot;,
<br>
do you think the Joint Chiefs are gonna go for it???  Hmmmm....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My opinion is the opposite of yours in this regard.  Of course I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want a radical islamic government creating an AGI whose unity of will is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with gun totting mullahs.  Rather I want the US government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military/civilian research institutions with whom I am comfortable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct this effort.
</em><br>
<p>The Singularity is directly opposed to the national interests of any
<br>
particular national government, because it will almost inevitably lead to a
<br>
&quot;revolution&quot; that will make national boundaries meaningless.
<br>
<p>Thus, no government should be trusted to play a leading role in the
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>Conceivably, some organization such as the UN could be trusted with this
<br>
role, but the current UN is obviously not well-suited.
<br>
<p>I agree that the US gov't would do a better job of governing the Singularity
<br>
than the Taliban.  But this is a moot point because there are no
<br>
technologically savvy nations with governments as immoral and psychopathic
<br>
as the Taliban.  The closest examples you could find would be China or
<br>
India, but their gov't's, though imperfect, are no Talibans, and they have
<br>
far less chance of achieving AGI than US, Western Europe or Japan in which
<br>
advanced computers are far more widespread.
<br>
<p>I might accept gov't funding for AGI research, but I would never willingly
<br>
place control of an AGI in the hands of any military organization.  That
<br>
really scares me.  Those people are not Singularity-savvy, and I don't trust
<br>
they will become so in the future, not in any healthy way.  Plus, their
<br>
interests are not those of the human race as a whole, let alone of sentience
<br>
as a whole.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
