It amazes me every time a new, well marketted, language or IDE comes out everyone starts extolling its new Lispy 
<br>
virtue as though its like had never been seen before by man.
<br>
<p>The code generation Ben H is talking about using in C# is, as has already been pointed out, very similar to Lisp macros.  
<br>
But Lisp has other features that make code generation easier and more generalizable.  For instance all the symbols 
<br>
(variables) are pointers, but can be compared and manipulated like standard variables of the same type in C.  The 
<br>
functions are all lists, manipulable with standard data ops.  Also there are no statements, only expressions.  The way in 
<br>
which this helps is rather hard for me to explain, even to myself, but it is definately helpful when you have code 
<br>
generators producing code generators, producing code:)
<br>
For more info on why Lisp is still the most &quot;powerful&quot; programming language, read: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/icad.html</a>
<br>
<p>I personally am currently designing my own lisp dialect.  The big difference with my dialect, called Zippered Lisp, is that 
<br>
instead of the basic data structures being atoms in lists, they will be cells in dimensions.  See Ted Nelson's ZigZag 
<br>
(<a href="http://xanadu.com/zigzag/">http://xanadu.com/zigzag/</a>), for more info on this wild data structure.
<br>
<p>Once its basically completed, I'll be integrating it with the opensource MMORPG libraries, Nel (<a href="http://www.nevrax.org">http://www.nevrax.org</a>) 
<br>
which I've been working with at my failing game startup for a couple years now.
<br>
<p>So in the end, I hope to have the most powerful computer language yet invented working with the most powerful 
<br>
generalizable data structure I can find, and a cutting edge massively multiuser 3d environment for the programs I write 
<br>
to run around in.
<br>
<p>What do the programmers of the list think?  What are your pet data structures?  Do you think its more valuable for 
<br>
creating AGI to have the perfect programming environment or the most well understood/used/available one?
