</em><br>
<p><p>Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I think that the creation of such an organization right now would be *a bit
<br>
premature*, which is why I said 2-3 years in the future might make sense
<br>
(and that may be overoptimistic, depending on how much progress anyone's AGI
<br>
project makes during that time frame).
<br>
<p>However, I really think it's silly to call the idea &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;suicidal.&quot;
<br>
At worst, in my view, it would be a useless sideshow; and at best it could
<br>
serve to infuse a very big decision with some additional wisdom.
<br>
<p>Remember -- in my proposal, this is an *advisory* group anyway, so it
<br>
wouldn't have real power over what an AGI's owner does with it....  How then
<br>
could it be suicidal?
<br>
<p>What you propose instead seems to be: &quot;The world should trust that whomever
<br>
first creates a seed AI, is probably wise enough to make all decisions
<br>
regarding the advent of the Singularity.&quot;  I think your proposal is pretty
<br>
darn dubious, as it relies on your psychological theory that only a person
<br>
of supreme wisdom can possibly create a seed AI -- and I think this
<br>
psychological theory is pretty darn dubious.
<br>
<p>I don't intend to spend my time currently forming committees, I intend to
<br>
continue to spend it working on designing, engineering, testing and (later)
<br>
teaching an AGI.  But if/when Novamente gets to near-human intelligence, I'm
<br>
going to be wise enough not to trust my own wisdom, and I'm going to do what
<br>
I've suggested: assemble a committee of Singularity wizards to help me
<br>
monitor Novababy's progress, help me teach the thing, and help make the deep
<br>
decisions the thing will lead to...
<br>
<p>And I hope very much that, if *your* AGI design/engineering efforts bear
<br>
fruit and produce a near-human-level AGI, you *at that point* will have seen
<br>
the error of assuming that your AGI-creation prowess necessarily implies
<br>
your immense personal wisdom... and I hope that you will, at that point,
<br>
follow some methodology similar to what I've described.
<br>
