<p>
The last sentence contains my description of 'wisdom' (excerpted from my
<br>
unpublished book on Rational Morality &amp; Rational Thinking):
<br>
<p>&quot;** Practical Thinking: Seeking Relevant Knowledge **
<br>
<p>Knowledge comes and goes. New knowledge is constantly discovered, and old
<br>
knowledge routinely becomes obsolete. Furthermore, the relevance of
<br>
knowledge also changes dramatically - it depends on context: Knowing the
<br>
location of my fourth-grade mathematics class is of little utility to me
<br>
today; having the function-keys of my old incompatible word-processor at my
<br>
fingertips can be downright crippling. While specific information can be of
<br>
transient value, knowing how to select for relevance is eternally useful.
<br>
<p>Potential knowledge represents an infinite pool of information. What tiny
<br>
subset of this vast information-space is relevant to me? Relevant for what
<br>
purpose? Ethics is concerned with choices that improve life. All knowledge
<br>
seeking, even the most aimless, serves some life-enhancing purpose: at the
<br>
very least, it exercises our cognitive skills. However, we can vastly
<br>
improve on this default option, we can direct our pursuit of knowledge
<br>
toward practical benefits in our lives. From solving puzzles for pure
<br>
pleasure, to concentrated research to prevent death - the degree of
<br>
beneficial impact lies on a continuum.
<br>
<p>We may call this practical thinking - thinking aimed at obtaining knowledge
<br>
that achieves its intended purpose, successful living. This is no ivory
<br>
tower theorizing, divorced from real life, but practical, effective,
<br>
purposeful thought. Today, this includes knowledge of psychology, technology
<br>
and finances, but also the more traditional concept of &quot;wisdom&quot;. Wisdom can
<br>
be described as seeking, possessing and using practical knowledge pertaining
<br>
to human life and, in particular, knowledge of human nature and
<br>
relationships. Wisdom also implies knowledgeable, considered, and objective
<br>
thought and advice.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>As far as morality &amp; 'what is right' go, two of my essays address those
<br>
issues.

</em><br>
<p>As has been mentioned, wisdom is a rather loose term.  Here is some attempt,
<br>
though, at identifying what we ought to mean by wisdom.
<br>
<p>Wisdom refers to an ability to make the right decision.  If you are wise,
<br>
you almost always make the right decision.
<br>
<p>So, now it's just a question of what's right.  The issue of morals has been
<br>
throughly debated elsewhere with few useful conclusions, so I won't go into
<br>
it here.
