<em>&gt; You are in college and need to take a class in general relativity.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice, though, that there are lots of members of the opposite sex in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that oral communication class.  In fact, there's one person in there you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a lot and would like to get to know better.  Taking that class will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set you back in your academic career.  Assuming that you are in college
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn and get some kind of degree, choosing to take the oral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication class because it might let you get to know someone better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an irrational decision.
</em><br>
<p>It seems that this is a matter of prioritizing short-term goals over
<br>
long-term goals.
<br>
<p>To do so is not intrinsically irrational.  What is irrational is *believing
<br>
that one is acting optimally toward one's long-term goals*, whereas
<br>
*actually* one is choosing one's actions toward one's short-term goals
<br>
<p>i.e., fooling oneself, by ignoring evidence
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have a job providing tech support.  After many days working and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about how bad your job is when you get home, you realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Grand Theory X would justify you being rude to the customers and you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a lot happier.  The first trap of irrationality is acting on Grad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theory X without having proven it.  If you get past that, there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.  So, you are sitting around trying to prove Grand Theory X and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start to come up with reasons that it must be true.  After a while you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a whole bunch of reasons that, while they sound a bit implausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at times, justify Grand Theory X in your eyes.  That's rationalization,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another form of irrational thought.  Telling the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalization and a logical progression of ideas is easy if you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for what to look.  If you are rationalizing, you start with a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and seek out evidence to support that conclusion.  Unless you have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well trained mind, you'll ignore the counter evidence and conclude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your conclusion is in fact true.  Logical thought occurs when you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some evidence and you get a conclusion from that.  Or, possibly, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a conclusion and you have some evidence and after sitting around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a long time and thinking hard and trying to come up with counter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples and failing, you find that the evidence really does support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some conclusion (more likely a slightly different conclusion than what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you started with).
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm....
<br>
<p>It almost seems that what you're calling &quot;rationalization&quot; is what logicians
<br>
call &quot;abduction&quot; or &quot;hypothesis&quot; -- one of the most important forms of
<br>
reasoning.
<br>
<p>A great many scientific theories begin by someone starting with a theory
<br>
they'd like to be true, and coming up with reasons why it might be true.
<br>
This is abduction, in essence.
<br>
<p>You are championing deductive inference, which is just one among several
<br>
modes of inference.  (And when probabilistic evidence is involved, deduction
<br>
is not *absolutely* certain either, although it tends to have
<br>
greater-confidence conclusiosn than induction or abduction.)
<br>
<p>I think that rationalization is, specifically, a *control mechanism for
<br>
inference* that *specifically seeks to consider only evidence in favor of
<br>
the truth of a certain proposition, rather than evidence against its truth.*
<br>
<p>It is not specifically tied to abduction, deduction, or any specific mode of
<br>
reasoning, in my view.  One can rationalize with pure deduction if one
<br>
wishes.
<br>
<p>Also, I think that *rationalization itself* is a powerful heuristic for
<br>
creative thought.
<br>
<p>However, really great creative thinkers may proceed by
<br>
<p>1) rationalizing their way to an interesting conclusion, by careful
<br>
inference control
<br>
<p>2) then, AFTERWARDS, considering their conclusion in a more balanced way,
<br>
looking at both positive and negative evidence equally
<br>
<p>In other words, I think that rationalization is an important part of the
<br>
creative thought process, but it is dangerous if used alone, rather than as
<br>
one stage in a multi-stage process
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you are trying to find a reason why your conclusion is true, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being to feel like you are straining to come up with support.  Stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right there.  If you don't know, you don't know, so don't make something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up, because whatever you make up is not helpful and will confuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters, an irrational choice.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, making stuff up is great.  The important thing is to,
<br>
afterwards, judge what you've made up by a harsher criterion (a fuller
<br>
consideration of evidence).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have a big test tomorrow and need to study for it.  Right in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle of studying, your girlfriend shows up and wants your attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ahem!).  The rational choice is to keep studying, because in the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run doing well on a test and learning material are more important than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making out.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is not irrationality intrinsically, it's a weighting of short
<br>
term over long term goals.
<br>
<p>It's irrational only if one fools oneself as to what one is doing.
<br>
<p>To say &quot;It's more important to me to get laid tonight than to graduate
<br>
college&quot; is not illogical, it's just a goal weighting that many people
<br>
consider normatively suboptimal...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are playing a gambling game.  You have $500 dollars.  First you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given a choice:  you can either be given another $100 or you can try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; win $500 more, but if you don't win, you get nothing.  It doesn't matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the odds are, $100 is almost always the more rational choice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it guaranteed and most people will pick that one.
</em><br>
<p>This is just silly...  If I were given this choice and the odds of getting
<br>
the extra $500 were 50%, I of course would take the 50% chance of an extra
<br>
$500.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, your statement about what most people will do is contradicted
<br>
by observed behavior on TV game shows ;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>I think that, in each case that you describe, the real irrationality comes
<br>
down, not to incorrect inference on a micro level, but rather to
<br>
*emotionally biased inference control.*
<br>
<p>What &quot;irrationality&quot; is, in my view, is largely the following.  One has a
<br>
conclusion that would be emotionally gratifying if it were true (and one has
<br>
a goal of gratifying the emotions in question).  One then biases the
<br>
information fed into one's logical inference component, in a specific way
<br>
oriented toward making the desired conclusion come true.  In a sense, this
<br>
produces a divided mind, which &quot;intentionally&quot; (though perhaps
<br>
unconsciously, still in a goal-oriented way) hides some knowledge that it
<br>
has from some parts of itself.
