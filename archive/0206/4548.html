<p>I think understand what you're suggesting, Eugen.
<br>
<p>You're suggesting that in 10-20 years from now,
<br>
<p>a) we will not have created a human-level AGI yet
<br>
<p>b) the gov'ts of the developed world will have instituted a surveillance
<br>
system that has its feelers in every computer chip of any reasonable power,
<br>
and every network hub, etc.  Maybe even in every brain!  AGI research will
<br>
be allowed only in gov't regulated facilities, and if the surveillance
<br>
system sees anyone doing unapproved AGI research, the gov't will step in and
<br>
squash it.
<br>
<p><p>I think this is a *possible* future, I just don't think it's a likely one.
<br>
<p>For one thing, unless we have world gov't, what's going to stop &quot;rogue
<br>
nations&quot; from developing their own AGI as part of their own defense/offense
<br>
efforts?  To assume a safe future ensured by regulation, you effectively
<br>
have to assume a world gov't, otherwise, your future is going to include
<br>
some kind of AGI arms race, which in my view is pretty darn dangerous.  (I
<br>
think it's *more* dangerous than a world where AGI is developed by industry
<br>
or maverick scientists... others may disagree.)
<br>
<p>I think the future you describe is unlikely even if your pessimistic stance
<br>
about the pace of AGI development is wrong.  But it's not an unthinkable or
<br>
ridiculous prognostication; of course, predicting the future is not easy,
<br>
especially in times of such rapid change...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I see a number of people talking deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering hubris in face of the mothers of high-complexity efforts with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the highest impact imaginable.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I can accept this characterization.  I have &quot;deep engineering hubris.&quot;
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>I kinda like the phrase, actually.  Someone should use it to title a band,
<br>
or at least a CD... not a techno CD, that would be too obvious; maybe some
<br>
retro early 80's hardcore ;&gt;
