<em>&gt; Abduction is observing something which is true, then increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those hypotheses which are compatible with the observation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition is similar to &quot;rationalization&quot;; and rationalization can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulate slack in hypotheses to change their predictions post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facto; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is why science requires prediction *before* the fact.
</em><br>
<p>Science does not REQUIRE prediction before the fact, it only prefers it.
<br>
<p>Well-known counterexamples are:
<br>
<p>-- The theory of the evolution of species by natural selection
<br>
-- Cosmology: the theory of the origin of the universe
<br>
<p>Neither of these, at this point, has made any verifiable predictions before
<br>
the fact ;&gt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  When you are using abduction properly you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are simultaneously trying to assemble supporting evidence and negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence, unprejudiced.  I do not think that trying to assemble only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting evidence leads to any greater intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we just have differing intuitions here.  The idea of &quot;brainstorming&quot;
<br>
is basically to ignore negative evidence at the start of a discovery
<br>
process.  The fact that this idea is widely-known indicates that I'm not the
<br>
only one in the world kooky enough to believe that sometimes ignoring
<br>
negative evidence in the early stages of discovery is a good idea ;&gt;
<br>
<p>One day we will be able to determine this empirically by running Novamente
<br>
(and other AI systems) with different inference control systems and seeing
<br>
how it works.  (Of course, in the long run, NOvamente will adapt its
<br>
inference control system anyway.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If, historically, many scientists arrived at correct conclusions through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalization, this does not show that rationalization is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for increasing individual intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>You're right, it does not prove that.  But I still believe the statement is
<br>
true, i.e. that rationalization is sometimes a good strategy for hypothesis
<br>
discovery.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I have found that, despite all common wisdom, the most critical part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being really creative lies in narrowing down inventiveness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct ideas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in &quot;brainstorming&quot;.  I don't need brainstorming.  I'm inventive enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already.  What's needed is inventiveness that hits correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targets and comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with ideas that are *really* true and not just ideas that *sound* true.
</em><br>
<p>The psychology of creativity shows that different people have different
<br>
creative processes, Eliezer.
<br>
<p>I believe you about YOU, but not about everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that excellence in creativity is only achieved when you no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to make stuff up.  I think that while you're in the &quot;making stuff up&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage you occasionally hit the target, but you miss it just as often, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's not good enough.  When you're in the &quot;making stuff up&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your raw intuitions plus occasionally correct abductive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypotheses for those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitions of yours that happen to be correct; &quot;making stuff up&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasionally correct rational support for those intuitions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be correct to begin with, but it doesn't let you refine your intuitions so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they become more powerful.
</em><br>
<p>Your report contradicts the reports of many great artists and scientists
<br>
regarding their creative process.
<br>
<p>For instance, in my book From Complexity to Creativity, I discussed briefly
<br>
the creative process of Linus Pauling:
<br>
<p>&quot;Pauling won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his theory of the chemical
<br>
bond; he also did more than anyone else to found the science of molecular
<br>
biology, and made important contributions to other areas, such as mineral
<br>
chemistry and metal chemistry. He described one of his key creative
<br>
processes as the &quot;stochastic method&quot; -- the free-form combination of facts
<br>
into novel configurations, leading to original hypotheses. In applying his
<br>
stochastic method, he relied on his tremendous store of factual information
<br>
and his outstanding physical and chemical intuition. He also relied on the
<br>
altered state of consciousness experienced when falling asleep, a state of
<br>
consciousness in which ideas blend into each other more easily than usual,
<br>
and on the mysterious, long-term creative processes of the unconscious.
<br>
<p>&quot;In physical chemistry proper, Pauling's stochastic guesses displayed an
<br>
uncanny accuracy. The combinations of facts arrived at by his unconscious
<br>
were nearly always the same ones present in the physical world! In chemical
<br>
biology and medicine, his guesses were less accurate, though he still made a
<br>
number of important discoveries. His creative process apparently did not
<br>
change from one research area to the other, but the average quality of the
<br>
results did. It appears that Pauling's ability to see new connections was so
<br>
powerful, and at the same time so stochastic, that it needed a very solid
<br>
body of factual knowledge to tie it down. This body of knowledge was there
<br>
in physical chemistry, but less so in molecular biology, and far less so in
<br>
medicine. (I have given a more detailed discussion of Pauling's scientific
<br>
thought in the middle chapters of the biography Linus Pauling: A Life in
<br>
Science and Politics (Ted and Ben Goertzel, Basic Books, 1995))&quot;
<br>
<p><p>He felt like he was stochastically combining things, and liked to get into
<br>
an altered (hypnopompic) state of consciousness to do so.  The results were
<br>
mighty good....
