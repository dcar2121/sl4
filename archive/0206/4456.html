</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I disagree.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In my book, if the infrahuman AI that thinks in this has decent odds of

<p>Depends on whether the infrahuman AI is likely to develop into an SI while
<br>
maintaining (what you hold to be) the moral errors of its programmers.  An
<br>
AI that retains the moral errors of its programmers is a deadly serious
<br>
problem whether or not it has the specific problematic habit of killing people!
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; A disagreement with a transhuman AI is pretty much equally serious
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; whether the AI is in direct command of a tank unit or sealed in a lab
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; on the Moon; intelligence is what counts.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; No the comfort level of the AI with killing people also counts, it seems
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to me.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why you could or would expect of an infrahuman AI that it would
<br>
exceed the wisdom of its programmers so early.  Why would you expect
<br>
anything else of an AI developed by honorable soldiers?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; Ben, what makes you think that you and I, as we stand, right now, do
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; not have equally awful moral errors embedded in our psyche?
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Well, based on your various disturbing comments in these recent threads,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I'm a lot more sure about me than about you ;-)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; According to your recent posts,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a) an AGI project forming an advisory board of Singularity wizards is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; suicidal
</em><br>
<p>SIAI has already considered forming an advisory board.  It was when James
<br>
Higgins proposed giving the &quot;group&quot; (note: not using the C-word) control
<br>
over all Singularity projects that I started having serious problems.
<br>
<p>James Higgins wrote:
<br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Ideally, I think deployment (kick off) of a Singularity project would be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; impossible without the agreement of this group.  (the keys would not be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in the possession of the developers).  All 10 people would have to agree
</em><br>
<em> &gt; in order to launch a Singularity attempt.  Ideally this same group would
</em><br>
<em> &gt; oversee all potential Singularity projects, so that they could analyze,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; compare and pick the one with the best potential to be launched.
</em><br>
<p>Anyway, back to Ben:
<br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; b) training infrahuman AI's to kill is morally unproblematic
</em><br>
<p>Obviously different AI researchers are going to have different ideas of what
<br>
constitutes a proximal moral problem.  The job of Friendly AI discussion is
<br>
to come up with a strategy such that this difference of opinion makes no
<br>
difference in the long run.  If someone wants to create a Friendly AI using
<br>
what I see as a morally flawed theory it is my business to come up with a
<br>
way to make the human species safe *anyway*, not to tell them to use my
<br>
morality instead.  Who knows which flaws we have in common?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; c) whomever creates an AGI, intrinsically has enough wisdom that they
</em><br>
<em> &gt; should be trusted to personally decide the future of the human race
</em><br>
<p>Heh.  No, it's much worse than that.  I didn't say that method was good,
<br>
just that every other method was worse.  Pleasant dreams.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Well, the point of view that led to these statements seems to *me* to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; embody some moral errors...
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Regarding your comments on the subjectivity of morality: Yes, I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; understand that my own morality, which has a tendency (though not an
</em><br>
<em> &gt; absolute one) toward pacifism, is not shared by all.  This is part of my
</em><br>
<em> &gt; motivation for thinking that, when a near-human-level-AI comes about, an
</em><br>
<em> &gt; advisory board of Singularity wizards would be a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>?
<br>
<p>It genuinely strikes me as very strange that anyone would try to fix the
<br>
subjective morality problem by taking 10 nodes with subjective moralities
<br>
and letting them work it out using a human political protocol.  If that was
<br>
all it took...
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Of course, this group will *still* not have an objective morality --
</em><br>
<em> &gt; there is no true objectivity in the universe -- but it would have a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; broader and less biased view than me or any other individual.
</em><br>
<p>That is not even close to being good enough.
