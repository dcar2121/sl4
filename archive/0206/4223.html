Hi james,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, we would hope that the team who created this AI doesn't give it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to the global network!  Or, if it does, it would be so highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictive as to (at least for the near term, pre-super intelligence)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent such uncontrolled expansion.  However, they could conceivably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant enough to grant such access or have a flaw in their security.
</em><br>
<p>This is a tricky issue.  The global network is an important source of info
<br>
for any AI in learning phase.  One wants to give one's young AI net access
<br>
via a kind of &quot;reverse firewall&quot; that allows it to gather data but not to
<br>
cause damage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;co-evolutionary competition and population pressure the AIs will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;start designing and building new hardware, which allows them to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And just how would they make the leap from running on silicon to building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silicon?  I'm almost certain that there is no capacity to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today.  They would have to be able to perform 100% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembly operation completely via computer, assemble the working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and connect it to the net.  All without human intervention.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a facility which had all of this capability computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlled (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe is the case, much of it is manual - moving pieces between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing workstations, etc) the operators would have to sit there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the machines spent hours (days?) &quot;doing their own thing&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>Your point is an excellent one.  However, there are plenty of scenarios one
<br>
can conjure to counter it.
<br>
<p>For instance, suppose the AI finds a way to threaten a lot of people with
<br>
death, and then basically *blackmails* humans into creating a fully
<br>
automated computer-and-robot-manufacturing facility for it....
<br>
<p>Or, more probably, suppose it finds some group of humans and promises them
<br>
lots of goodies if they build it the right automated manufacturing
<br>
facilities....  it's almost inconceivable that an AGI, capable of predicting
<br>
financial markets and hence getting lots of $$, couldn't find *some* group
<br>
of humans to build it whatever it wanted for cash payment...
<br>
<p>I can see a future gov't wasting a lot of effort protecting against
<br>
military-style attacks by AGI, and then finding that an AGI actually takes
<br>
over the world via financial &amp; political machinations...
<br>
<p>Remember how the Brits took over New Zealand.  They never conquered the
<br>
Maori militarily.  They just wheeled and dealed the land out from under
<br>
them, in deals with varying degrees of crookedness....
<br>
<p>All a superhuman AGI needs is to be able to outsmart us in financial and
<br>
business situations, and it will effectively own the world, within a matter
<br>
of years.  And this can happen behind the scenes, and large corporations
<br>
will allow it to happen if it's in their own temporary financial interest,
<br>
i.e. if it boosts their quarterly profits, regardless of the potential
<br>
long-term consequences....  And if US corporations won't (yah, right), some
<br>
foreign corporations will...
<br>
