</em><br>
<p>Do you seriously think that it is moral to mass-distribute a version of 
<br>
the Singularity meme that massively underplays the individual's role in 
<br>
creating the Singularity?  What kind of difference do you think it 
<br>
would make for the Singularity if that same meme were spread, but 
<br>
*with* encouragement of individual action?  I'm not worried about 
<br>
Eliezer's suggestions at all - as he said, there are futurists out 
<br>
there who are shocked how someone can &quot;get&quot; the Singularity but not 
<br>
take personal responsibility or devote a dime of money to technologies 
<br>
aimed directly at it.  Creating musical and poetry writing software is 
<br>
cute and fun, but the same money invested in that sort of stuff can 
<br>
give us hundreds or thousands of times the return if invested in a 
<br>
technology that more directly supported the Singularity.  There's 
<br>
already enough waste in the world, seriously.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Producing and forwarding the meme is no small contribution. 
</em><br>
<p>Producing and forwarding the wrong meme can do more harm than good, 
<br>
because once the meme gets around, it may be too late to change 
<br>
anybody's mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the meme catches fire the technologists and investors will follow.
</em><br>
<p>True Singularity-furthering technologies *may* not turn out to have 
<br>
immediate, obvious, impressive returns.  Other areas will almost 
<br>
certainly be more appealing, at least at first.  Contributions directly 
<br>
aimed at the Singularity may be generated out of pure altruism and 
<br>
Singularitarianism alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't know what Singularity as religion has to do with this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conversation one way or the other.
</em><br>
<p>The idea is that if people use the Singularity as a passive excuse to 
<br>
continue on with what they are already doing, although assigning it 
<br>
more imaginary value, regardless of whether they have actually changed 
<br>
their actions to accelerate the Singularity more directly, those people 
<br>
will be acting religious.  And that is absolutely correct.
