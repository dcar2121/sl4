</em><br>
<em>&gt;1. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should come first and it is true
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;2. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should come first and it is false
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Friendliness should come first. (Slightly negative).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should not come first and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;false that Friendliness should come first. (Slightly positive outcome).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;4. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should not come first and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true that Friendliness should come first. (Worst outcome).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1 is best because we have effectively raised the probability of a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;singularity. Of course we should not make light of 2 and 3. If it takes X
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years to figure out Friendliness and it is inefficient to focus on it now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(as B.G. maintains) then a lot of time (= a lot of lives) could be wasted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;With 4 at best we squander our opportunity to raise the probability of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good singularity, at worst we are responsible for a bad singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(unforeseen hard tack off). Thus,  given our uncertainty and what is at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stake I think we should act as if Friendliness should come first.
</em><br>
<p>Pascal's wager makes perfect sense where only a single individual in 
<br>
involved.  If *I* don't believe and God exists *I* go to hell.  This is not 
<br>
if *we* don't believe in God *I* go to hell nor if *I* don't believe in God 
<br>
*we* go to hell.  If only one person (or one team) were working on the 
<br>
AI/Singularity problem then the obvious logical course of action would be 
<br>
#1.  This is not the case, though.  Multiple people/teams can pursue the 
<br>
different possibilities in parallel.  This is actually the best course of 
<br>
action, assuming we can prevent a hard takeoff, since we don't know which 
<br>
answer is correct.  To illustrate this consider this rule applied to 
<br>
Pascal's wager: as long as at least one person believes in God everyone 
<br>
would go to heaven (if God exists).
