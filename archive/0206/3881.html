</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; list, I'm asking you to reply with any additions that you might have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Here's what we have so far (putting my initial list and Eliezer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; additions together):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Beyond anthropomorphism by Eliezer Yudkowsky (section 2 of CFAI)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Man:  The Moral Animal by Robert Wright
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The Mind's Past by Michael S. Gazzaniga
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you're going to recommend Pirsig, I think his second book (what was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; title?  &quot;Lila&quot; ?) actually went into a lot more depth about the working 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mind, the patterns of culture and their influence on the mind, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Check it out.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I will.  I haven't read anything written by Pirsig (BTW, that name 
<br>
has neat typography; most words don't look like anything) and I only 
<br>
just read /Mr. Feynman/, which is an interesting book.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A really really deep book on the freeing of the mind from irrationality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all sorts is &quot;Thought as a System&quot; by David Bohm, which goes on and on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberating ourselves from cultural and biological thought systems.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply influenced by Bohm's (he's a quantum physicist) long relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Krishnamurti
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I'll look into that.  There is also a video series called /The 
<br>
Transformation of Man/ with Krishnamurti and him.  It's a bit older 
<br>
(circa 1970) so there are bound to be ideas in it that we now know are 
<br>
errors, but it seems to be worth a look.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Krishnamurti, &quot;The Nature of the Mind&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://208.234.18.51/mcart/index.cgi?ID=QZYELO&amp;task=show&amp;cat=Nature+of+the">http://208.234.18.51/mcart/index.cgi?ID=QZYELO&amp;task=show&amp;cat=Nature+of+the</a></em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hmm, this and the video series I mentioned above seem related.  Combined 
<br>
they're 500 minutes of material.  This should be an excellent resource.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that to get many humans to think significantly more rationally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) impossible, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) such a long-term project that it would take vastly longer than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10-100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years we have till the Singularity
</em><br>
<p>True, and I don't see it as necessary to make everyone rational.  I hope 
<br>
that if we can reach some of the more influential people in society, 
<br>
development of the Singularity might go more easily in those last few 
<br>
months/years.
<br>
<p>As Michael Anissimov said to me over #sl4, he likes the idea because it 
<br>
might improve Singularitarians, making a better team of supporters and 
<br>
possible developers.  Even if this is all that comes of the project, 
<br>
it's still a worthwhile accomplishment, in my opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, while I think that advocating rational thought is a good thing, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts in this regard are going to help much with Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No reason not to try though ;)
</em><br>
<p>I know it probably won't have a significant effect on the Singularity, 
<br>
but I have to find some way to make this on topic.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One more thing; I think the term &quot;rational thought&quot; can rub some people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong way.  It rubs *me* the wrong way a little, and would certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same impact (but more strongly) on many artists &amp; musicians &amp; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whom I know.  Artistic sorts value their &quot;irrational&quot; intuitions and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tastes
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, this is an interesting concern.  Unfortunately, I think that more 
<br>
accurate terminology will hurt the meme's ability to spread because it 
<br>
wouldn't have an easy to remember name.  Thank you for pointing this 
<br>
out, though, because this is a concern that I probably would have 
<br>
neglected to address somewhere early in the text.
<br>
<p>IIRC, I started using the `rational thought' terminology because when I 
<br>
was setting up the mailing list for Rational Thinkers I had to have some 
<br>
name for it an `rational' was the most appropriate words I could think 
<br>
of.  It was likely inspired by recent use of the word on SL4 or 
<br>
somewhere else.  If someone can think of a good replacement, please let 
<br>
me know.
