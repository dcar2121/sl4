</em><br>
<em>&gt; So far, based on these disussions, when i rewrite the &quot;AI Morality&quot; essay I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will add in the following points, with elaborated explanations:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI morality and AI consciousness are only going to become scientific when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are pursued as *experimental science*, and we're just not there yet...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until then it's just entertaining, thought-stimulating conjecture...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's important to put in protections against unexpected hard takeoff, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the effective design of these protections is hard, and the right way to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will only be determined thru experimentation with actual AGI systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (again, experimental science)
</em><br>
<p>This is not good enough. No AI project should find itself in the situation
<br>
of both being in a potential takeoff situation, and simultaneously having
<br>
no mechanisms to prevent a takeoff. If you can't figure this out, then you
<br>
should never run your code in the first place. To me, this looks like
<br>
another case of your overoptimism (which is the exact opposite of what is
<br>
required when dealing with existential risks- you need to practice walking
<br>
around all the time expecting doom) leading to unnecessary risks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it is a tough decision to decide when an AGI should be allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase its intelligence unprotectedly.  A group of Singularity wizards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be consulted, it shouldn't be left up to one guy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MAYBE I will also replace the references to my own personal morality with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; references to some kind of generic &quot;transhumanist morality.&quot;  However, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would take a little research into what articulations of transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality already exist.  I know the Extropian stuff, but for my taste, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally emphasizes the virtue of compassion far too little....
</em><br>
<p>Speaking as a human who is potentially affected by your AI, this isn't
<br>
good enough for me. You'll have to come up with a better answer before I'll
<br>
willingly go along with such a plan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I will not do in any revision of the essay -- except one written after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant experimentation with a Novababy has been done -- is introduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any definitive statement that one or another particular approach to ensuring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness, or measuring intelligence increase, is likely to be effective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel there is just too much uncertainty in these regards, at this stage.
</em><br>
<p>Any uncertainty has to err on the side of CAUTION, which means you stick
<br>
those things into your AI before you run it, JUST IN CASE, even if they
<br>
turn out not to work after testing. Something is better than nothing.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm glad of your uncertainty, but you're not handling it like you would
<br>
rationally handle it in the case of an existential risk- you're handling it
<br>
more like you would starting a business with someone else's money, and if it
<br>
doesn't work out then &quot;oops, oh well&quot;. Not good enough
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are there any other significant issues that you think should be addressed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the revision, Brian?  Knowing what you know now about my overall point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view on these matters?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Any other legitimate things Eliezer or others pointed out to you privately
<br>
or publicly should be addressed. The issue should be looked at from all
<br>
sides. Three times. Then look at it again.
