</em><br>
<p>So, are you &quot;dead certain&quot; that the AI won't purposely stop evolving its 
<br>
intelligence for a period of time?  Possibly to focus on something else 
<br>
(that we may not even know exists)?  I think the only thing we can be &quot;dead 
<br>
certain&quot; about is that we can't be certain about anything regarding the SI 
<br>
(at least at this point)...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I think the period of transition from human-level AI to superhuman-level AI
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suppose I could see a month, but anything longer than that is pretty

</em><br>
<p>A month?  Are we talking about going from human-equivalent to SI or merely 
<br>
significantly beyond human level?  I could, possibly, see getting into the 
<br>
lower stages of super-human in a month, but getting to SI would take much 
<br>
longer I would imagine.  Espicially since it may take considerable time to 
<br>
design &amp; produce the next level of hardware at the beginning.  My guess is 
<br>
that it would take numerous hardware iterations to get to super-human 
<br>
level, which could easily take months to years.  And the jump to nano-tech 
<br>
or other extremely advanced production methods will take super-human level 
<br>
to invent/implement.  Thus the early stages will likely be very slow, but 
<br>
will exponentially increase in speed.  But, then again, virtually anything 
<br>
is actually possible.  We won't really know until we get there 
<br>
(unfortunately)...
<br>
<p>Personally, I'd like to see someone like Ben be at the helm of the first 
<br>
successful SI.  I'd feel much more comfortable about the future of Humanity 
<br>
that way...
