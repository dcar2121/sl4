</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, what I'm worried about is that Kurzweil seems to be spreading a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutant nonactivist form of the meme.  Vernor Vinge's original stories of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity were based around the blazing disruptive power of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter-than-human intelligence, not the inexorable grinding of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wheels of industry churning out transhumanity as a safe, ordinary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; luxury.
</em><br>
<p><p>OK, but the hard takeoff variant of Singularity is not the only one and 
<br>
is not necessarily the way that it will work out in at least a 
<br>
generation or two.  So, if someone wants to work from where we are to 
<br>
take it step by step, I have a hard time seeing that as wrong or at all 
<br>
immoral.  Vinge's stories are stories, not gospel, not even an airtight 
<br>
case for how it will be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore Vinge's stories often show, realistically, individuals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or projects that play a critical role in the final Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (regardless of how much background technological progress contributes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it).  Vernor Vinge's 1993 NASA lecture emphasizes both the speed of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes once created and the size of the stakes - and while we're at it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also emphasizes the need to enter the Singularity with our best foot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward, the possible differences between technologies, and the fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the intrinsic rate of some technologies may be faster than others.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At this moment Kurzweil's version of the Singularity meme doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include *any* of Vinge's strategic, activist thinking, except in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very diluted form of deciding which inevitability to predict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>He has his own version of strategic activist thinking on a fairly 
<br>
different model from what I can tell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Vinge and I have very different approaches toward how our lives can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter in humanity's sweep toward the Singularity, but structurally our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking is similar enough that I have no worries about the memes he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spreads.  If Vinge should make what I regard as a strategic error, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't expect it will be any problem to point it out from within Vinge's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kurzweil gave a presentation at Extro 5.  During the Q&amp;A session, I got 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up and said (if I recall correctly, that is; the video is on Kurzweil's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site):  &quot;Well, you've told us to expect a Singularity, but you haven't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told us whether it's good or bad, or what we should be doing about it.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are our marching orders?&quot;  Kurzweil stood stock still for around 7 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds until some still-unforgiven voice from the audience gave him an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out by asking &quot;Well, what do you mean by the Singularity?&quot;, and Kurzweil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took it.  Ben Goertzel, after Kurzweil's presentation, said:  &quot;I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think we should get so caught up in predicting that nanotechnological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immune systems will exist that we forget to actually develop the immune 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems,&quot; and got a round of applause from the audience - because there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was no hint of that in Kurzweil's presentation.  At the Foresight 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gathering, I asked &quot;Have you considered whether we could accelerate the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity?&quot; and Kurzweil said, in an incredulous tone, &quot;How could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone possibly accelerate the Singularity?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't read this as Kurzweil having considered the possibility of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activism and rejected it because he can't think of anything good.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read it as &quot;activism&quot; structurally conflicting with Kurzweil's thinking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This causes me to worry about Kurzweil being the Singularity 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spokesperson in a way that I would not worry about for Vinge.  I am sure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Kurzweil has done enormously more in the way of concrete 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological development than Vinge.  But Vinge has an activist outlook 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Singularity.  Kurzweil is speaking from within a view which does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not structurally permit activism.  I am worried about this view being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmitted to Kurzweil's audience.
