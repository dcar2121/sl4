<p>That's quite odd since last I checked Ben wasn't even interested in
<br>
the idea of Friendliness until we invented it and started pointing out
<br>
to SL4 exactly how important it is. Not that it seems to have had much
<br>
effect since he still has no plans that I know of to alter his rather
<br>
dramatically risky seed AI experimentation protocol (basically not
<br>
adding any Friendliness features until /after/ he decides that the
<br>
AI has advanced enough) (he has a gut feel you see, and there's certainly
<br>
no chance of a hard takeoff, and even if it did he's quite sure it would
<br>
all turn out ok... trust him on it)
<br>
<p>I'm still not quite sure how he gets away with engendering the kind of
<br>
sentiment I see above, I guess it is because we go to the effort to
<br>
put our plans out for public review and he sits in with the rest of the
<br>
crowd picking them apart. At least we _have_ plans out for public
<br>
review.
<br>
<p>How about we set July for picking Ben's plan apart. After all he is far
<br>
closer to completion (he claims) than anyone else, yet few people here
<br>
seem to have anywhere near as good a grasp of his ideas compared to
<br>
SIAI's.
<br>
<p>Disclaimer: this post is not intended to start any kind of us vs. them
<br>
phenomena. It exists simply to point out a perceived important difference
<br>
in the amount of critical discussion regarding the two organizations' plans.
