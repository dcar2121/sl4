<em>&gt; 1)  Your statement that &quot;it is impossible to write a story about a character
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smarter than you are&quot; is clearly false, and rather odd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many authors have written good stories about characters smarter than they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, and evoked this superior intelligence well.  As a single example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the sci-fi classic &quot;Flowers for Algernon.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>As it happens, that *specific example* is used in &quot;Staring into the 
<br>
Singularity&quot; to bring out the point.
<br>
<p>If Charlie Gordon had been as smart as he was depicted as being, he would 
<br>
have realized that his brain was probably due to burn out without needing to 
<br>
be bitten by Algernon, and could have understood what was going on before 
<br>
performing a complex analysis of Strauss and Nemur's surgical technique; he 
<br>
could have reasoned that since there was nothing  about the surgical 
<br>
technique (as depicted in the story) to prevent it from occurring as a 
<br>
natural point mutation, and could moreover be applied so universally within 
<br>
the mammalian line as to work on Algernon as well, it was probably a net 
<br>
evolutionary disadvantage.  Of course it would still be valuable to have the 
<br>
specific quantitative demonstration that artificially increased intelligence 
<br>
would deteriorate at a rate of time directly proportional to the quantity of 
<br>
the increase.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless it does demonstrate one of the basic differences between 
<br>
intelligence and smartness.  Daniel Keyes can give Charlie Gordon a dozen 
<br>
languages as long as they don't appear in the dialogue (or, if necessary, 
<br>
Keyes could have gotten someone else to produce the dialogue); he can make 
<br>
Charlie Gordon do lightning calculations in his head as long as the 
<br>
calculations don't appear in the book or Keyes can do the calculations on a 
<br>
pen and paper over time; he can have Charlie Gordon invent a calculus of 
<br>
intelligence as long as it doesn't have to be produced within the story. 
<br>
Nonetheless Charlie's upper limit on smartness is the smartness of Keyes. 
<br>
He does the things that Keyes imagines himself doing with Charlie's 
<br>
abilities, but not the things that a real Charlie Gordon would do.  The 
<br>
events depicted in &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; happen to be roughly plausible in 
<br>
the real world (which is why I selected that example for &quot;Staring into the 
<br>
Singularity&quot;).  In the story Charlie attributes this to a mysterious 
<br>
neurological effect which is depicted but never explained; within the story 
<br>
it's hidden behind Charlie's opaque science skillz.  The nontechnical reason 
<br>
I gave, which can be easily explained to a lay reader, is actually much 
<br>
closer to the heart of smartness than Charlie's madd science skillz - but 
<br>
for that very reason, Charlie didn't think of it.
<br>
<p>Or maybe Keyes did think of it but decided not to include it in the story - 
<br>
Keyes isn't prohibited from writing a dumber character, just a smarter one. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is that real smartness is often very simple, and for that reason 
<br>
is far stranger and more powerful than technobabble churned out for the 
<br>
purpose of conforming to the Spock stereotype - &quot;genius&quot; as a human dressed 
<br>
up as a computer for Holloween.  The reason why I don't like to see people 
<br>
trying to export our conception of &quot;physical limits&quot; onto the Singularity is 
<br>
not so much because I expect post-Singularity entities to break the laws of 
<br>
physics with madd t3chnology skillz (though this is also a possibility) but 
<br>
because there could be some simple little reason we haven't thought of why 
<br>
you don't *need* to break the laws.
