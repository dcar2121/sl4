<em>&gt; &gt; As miltary ethics are somewhat codified I believe a military AGI

<em>&gt; &gt; may in fact be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *more* desirable case for AGI development.  Again this is said from the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oh man this is a scary day of e-mails!!!
</em><br>
<p>Yep, certainly is.  This also illustrates my points, I believe.  Although 
<br>
even I would rather not see them illustrated quite so well in a single 
<br>
day.  Seeing CFAI applied in such a manor really makes me queasy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;First we have Eli, who thinks that whomever can build an AGI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intrinsically possessed with tremendous wisdom...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And now, this assertion that the US military should be trusted with AGI and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Singularity...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My Singularity optimism is rapidly getting the jitters!  Eugen, maybe you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right.... (Just kidding -- partly...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't doubt that there are many trustworthy, moral individuals within the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;no way Jose'.  This is the crew that invaded Grenada... the organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that nuked Japan (probably both bombs were needless, but it's pretty damn

<em>&gt;clear the second one was), that systematically tortured Vietnamese women and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;children in the name of democracy and justice....  I'll spare you a full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list of examples.  Ever read the first-person account of how US soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chopped off the arms and legs of a Vietnamese woman, inserted dynamite in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;her vagina and blew her up?  Not an outlier occurence.  Excuse me if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impeccable morality of the US military seems a little questionable to me...
</em><br>
<p>Ok, not even regarding these matters.  The US military FOLLOWS 
<br>
ORDERS.  Those orders come, at the top, from very few people   Some of 
<br>
which may not have the morality and discipline you are attributing to the 
<br>
military in any case.  The president, who is elected primarily on a 
<br>
popularity campaign, would have direct control over this SI.  That is the 
<br>
most worrisome idea I've heard in awhile.  There is no way to guarantee 
<br>
such power would be wielded properly, and we're talking about something 
<br>
MUCH, MUCH more devastating than the nuclear arsenal.  Not to mention that 
<br>
the SI could be insidious, clandestine, smooth, or whatever else was 
<br>
necessary.  Hell, why not have the SI take control of the world markets so 
<br>
the US could reap all the money?  But, where should that money go?  Well, 
<br>
maybe the president happens to own a few companies that could use some 
<br>
exponential expansion...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Yeah, the US military has done some good (I didn't like the Taliban either).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And some evil.  And the people who run it are charged with protecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interests of the USA (the military and ECONOMIC interests, as history amply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shows), not with promoting the general good of the human race.  If a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity is gonna lead to the greater general good for sentient life, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may lead to the dissolution of the US as an entity and the consequent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meaninglessness of the US military and ranks like &quot;general&quot; and &quot;admiral&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do you think the Joint Chiefs are gonna go for it???  Hmmmm....
</em><br>
<p>And there we have the biggest problem.  The Singularty should be, and needs 
<br>
to be, for everyone.  Not just one government.  If this were to occur we 
<br>
could see SI warfare between governments.  I horror at the thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; My opinion is the opposite of yours in this regard.  Of course I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want a radical islamic government creating an AGI whose unity of will is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with gun totting mullahs.  Rather I want the US government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military/civilian research institutions with whom I am comfortable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; direct this effort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Singularity is directly opposed to the national interests of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular national government, because it will almost inevitably lead to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;revolution&quot; that will make national boundaries meaningless.
</em><br>
<p>I believe this is inevitable.  Well, unless we end up in one of the 
<br>
nightmare scenarios.  Which I'd rather not think about today...
