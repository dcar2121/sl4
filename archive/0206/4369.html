<p>&quot;Smartness is that quality which makes it impossible to write a story about 
<br>
a character smarter than you are.  You can write about super-fast thinkers, 
<br>
eidetic memories, lightning calculators; a character who learns a dozen 
<br>
languages in a week, who can read a textbook in an hour, or who can invent 
<br>
all kinds of wonderful stuff - as long as you don't have to produce the 
<br>
actual invention.  But you can't write a character with a higher level of 
<br>
emotional maturity, a character who can spot the obvious solution you 
<br>
missed, a character who knows (and can tell the reader) the Meaning Of Life, 
<br>
a character with superhuman self-awareness.  Not unless you can do these 
<br>
things yourself.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Eliezer Yudkowsky, &quot;Staring into the Singularity&quot;
<br>
<p>If your reason for designating von Neumann as a &quot;greater genius&quot; than 
<br>
Einstein was just the showoff lightning-calculator stuff, then I think we're 
<br>
talking past each other.  I don't consider that genius, or even relevant to 
<br>
a discussion of intelligence, unless it contributes to actual smartness.
