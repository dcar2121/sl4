</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Click the stopwatch at the end of the speech.  Let me know how long it

<em>&gt; It is tempting to do exactly as you suggest (since it would prove the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point), but I have better things to do with my time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a)  If they think I'm nuts the worst they could do is order a psych 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluation.  I'm not nuts so in a few days (at most) I'm free to do as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b)  If they take me seriously they can't jail me because creating an AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not illegal.  They could work on passing laws to make it illegal but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would take considerable time (possibly years), especially since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no &quot;obvious&quot; and present danger
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You might want to check out the &quot;Patriot&quot; Act and its 
<br>
cyberterrorism sections rather carefully before you assert that 
<br>
or depend on it.  In case you haven't noticed the US feds can 
<br>
now throw people (even citizens) in jail on trumped up charges 
<br>
they do not have to make public and without giving the detainee 
<br>
access to a lawyer or even admitting they are holding the 
<br>
person.  They can do this, under not difficult to contrive 
<br>
circumstances, to most anyone they wish.  It is a very different 
<br>
world than what we thought we grew up in.
<br>
<p>Also, I was attempting to make the point that saying you are 
<br>
outside the law makes you an outlaw, a wild card, a clear and 
<br>
present danger.  Your only hope is to not be taken seriously 
<br>
until it is too late.  Of course, that isn't necessarily good 
<br>
for the world at large.
