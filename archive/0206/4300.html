<p>The world is complex, at least if one wants to survive in it. Presence of 
<br>
life tends to make it even more complex, especially if it's intelligent 
<br>
life. A useful AI needs to be performance competitive with instances of 
<br>
life. Directed self-improvement requires at least human intelligence 
<br>
level. (Stochastically driven improvement has much lower requirements).
<br>
<p>Somewhere you need to encode that complexity. The distinction between
<br>
hardware and software is rather meaningless (we can safely assume a quite
<br>
simple transformation on a pattern will do), but the pattern must contain
<br>
a lot of assumptions about how the world is structured in order to be able
<br>
to start extracting knowledge from it.
<br>
<p>Biology starting with the fertilized egg is deceptive, because the human
<br>
baby is the result of a trapdoor function on the zygote. The inverse
<br>
function is never computed, since evolution is Darwinian, not Lamarckian.
<br>
Since we can't emulate life's morphogenesis, we can't use the genome for
<br>
compact encoding. If we look at a baby, we see lots of dirty, but
<br>
irreducible complexity. A naturally intelligent AI seed must contain a lot
<br>
of that complexity, in order to be able to abstract knowledge from the
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>I'm a bit at loss why most people here think you can just sit down, think
<br>
briefly, introspect a little, and write down that very large vector. This
<br>
is a lot like taking a core dump on the world. Without a lot of trial and
<br>
error, what is the source of that knowledge?
