<em>&gt; &gt; The idea that Novamente has more potential to *ever* be smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Microsoft Word is *also* &quot;just my opinion&quot;... or rather, &quot;just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of me and the others who have studied the codebase&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Can't you see that if the odds of a certain software system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going superhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are *sufficiently low*, then no protective measures are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaningful?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, although last I checked M$ Word wasn't self modifying.
</em><br>
<p>If it were, would Microsoft tell you??
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point all my devil's advocacy is about: if you get to the point where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have running self modifying code, you should already have in place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plenty of safety measures.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, now I think you're being too unconservative.  Or maybe just loose
<br>
with the definition of &quot;self-modifying.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think that a takeoff to vastly superhuman intelligence *could* occur
<br>
without any significant self-modification, just via a system with a fixed
<br>
(but good) AI architecture learning a lot, including learning how to think
<br>
better.  Of course, all learning involves some self-modification (modifying
<br>
the memory with new knowledge, modifying one's cognitive schema for
<br>
approaching different kinds of computers, etc.)
<br>
<p>I would rather say &quot;when you get to the point where you have a system that
<br>
can autonomously interact with the outside world, and can potentially
<br>
experience significant intelligence increase.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, no the reason is just that you're around and willing to talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it. Which I do have to give you a lot of credit for. I'll be even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more impressed if you do eventually get out your &quot;social policy&quot; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism well before you get your total codebase running.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, we will do that...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them, you, us, or anyone else working on this stuff needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have concrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-documented plans for how to deal with these issues well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before they get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near the point of actual testing. If one of them was here instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of you I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be pressuring them just the same... hopefully they are getting the message
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by lurking.
</em><br>
<p>So far as I know, all other AGI developers take about the same position as
<br>
me, albeit more quietly.
<br>
<p>They think that once their system is advanced enough according to their own
<br>
intuitions, they're going to put in appropriate protections.
<br>
<p>E.g. I know Peter Voss thinks it's just way too early to be seriously
<br>
talking about such things, and that he's said as much to Eliezer as well...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am still concerned that your commercial focus may be causing you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cut dangerous corners in the long run,
</em><br>
<p>hey, I would love to have some funding for &quot;pure Novamente AI&quot; work,
<br>
hopefully that will come in the next couple years...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;hopefully you'll address that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your eventual documentation. Have a good vacation! :-)
</em><br>
<p>thanks...
<br>
