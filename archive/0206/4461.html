<em>&gt;ADVISORY BOARD, MY LEFT FOOT.

</em><br>
<p>Ah, I see.  Glad to see we're discussing it, finally.  And if you had 
<br>
raised this point earlier, instead of &quot;panicking&quot; (your word) we could have 
<br>
cleared this up quite easily.  This, once again, is why I don't think 
<br>
intelligence directly equates to wisdom.  I'm not saying you have no 
<br>
wisdom, Eliezer, just that you don't frequently show as much as I would 
<br>
like to see of it on SL4.  Please see the reply I just posted (in response 
<br>
to this exact same quote you used in your reply to Ben) for clarification 
<br>
on my viewpoint.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; My interest is *not* in convincing people that solutions will work.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; want a solution that *does work*.  I suppose, as a secondary goal, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I want people to know the truth, but that is not primary; solving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; problem is primary.  It is not supposed to be persuasive, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; supposed to ACTUALLY WORK.  Lose sight of that and game over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but have you actually considered the idea that you could be wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That YOUR ideas may not work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Oh, for the love of -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Would I have spent O(N^2) hours working out a goal system architecture 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that lets an AI sanely spot and fix architectural errors in its own goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system if I thought I was infallible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now ask me whether I think your &quot;not a committee, just 10 bickering people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with individual veto power over the Singularity&quot; idea is going to work.
</em><br>
<p>I think the advisory board would be a good think and would help.  The 
<br>
committee I originally suggested probably would not work, but the real goal 
<br>
of it was to try and reign you in a bit (since you seemed to be getting 
<br>
more and more detached from reality).  :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Have you considered what would happen if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this were the case?  As they say, two heads are better than one (which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; btw, I very much agree with).  So having a few different people all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; working on the Friendliness problem would be highly beneficial.  If for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no other reason than it would give all of them alternate ideas to look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  and think about, which may then improve their own designs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CFAI is on the Web.
</em><br>
<p>?
<br>
<p>Not certain how that relates to the point that more solutions to choose 
<br>
from and take ideas from would be better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I know a *lot* of AI morality concepts that sound appealing but are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; utterly unworkable.  For that reason, above all else, I am scared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; death of committees.  It seems very predictable what the result will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  and it will be absolutely deadly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Would you please get off the committee thing.  Your sounding like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; broken record because you just keep repeating the same point, over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over.  Advisory board, not committee (I should NEVER have called it such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - my bad).  Everyone can always use some good advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Okay, if the resolution of this is that you call for the creation of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advisory board and the earlier committee concept gets sunk, buried, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;burned, then I'd accept that as a temporary &quot;win&quot; for the good guys.  Not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the notion isn't going to shamble forth from its grave and have to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defeated again every six months.
</em><br>
<p>See, we do agree (at least sometimes).  That is all I wanted you to agree 
<br>
with.  If you can convince me that your not egomaniacal nor have a 
<br>
self-important viewpoint then I'll work just as hard as you to defeat the 
<br>
idea of &quot;The Committee&quot; should it shamble forth from its grave...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Its seems to be inherently difficult to convince you that your not god
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and shouldn't personally be making all the decisions that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; permanently seal the fate of the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If I thought that I'd be advocating the idea of SIAI having veto power 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over all AI projects, on the basis of our greater expertise, dedication, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altruism, and understanding of the Singularity.  *NOBODY* should have that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power.  Not me, not your committee, not anyone.  Once we start fighting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over who gets to give orders instead of working out the best engineering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solution, the main issue has been lost.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, I'm not God.  Why would your ten people with veto power be God?  What 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exactly has been gained here?  Maybe you need to stew over the problem and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;let it slowly drive you insane for a few weeks, rather than picking on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first solution that comes to mind.
</em><br>
<p>They wouldn't be God, of course.  Although, it strikes me that creating the 
<br>
Singularity is as close to playing God as one can get.  But, I digress.
