</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but Darpa does not create technology *solely* for the
<br>
military/intelligence community.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If such an agency were to attempt the Singularity (or just transhuman AI)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; answered that the things it was asked to do were not friendly and, thus, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not cooperate.
</em><br>
<p>Let's talk about a use case to highlight your point.  Certainly the
<br>
military would want an AGI to perform battlespace decisions affecting
<br>
tactical defense and offense.  There are already highly automated systems
<br>
that await a (superior) replacement for the &quot;human in the loop&quot;.  So a
<br>
military AGI would be tasked to &quot;put metal on a target&quot; of its choice.
<br>
<p>As I understand from studing CFAI the AGI would simply have a unity of
<br>
will with its developers.  In the military case, this means an
<br>
understanding of duty, and the correctness of the mission. An AGI does not
<br>
necessarily have to be a pacifist.  The military has good, and logical
<br>
arguments as to why we need to have a military.
<br>
<p>As miltary ethics are somewhat codified I believe a military AGI may in fact be a
<br>
*more* desirable case for AGI development.  Again this is said from the
<br>
viewpoint of one who trusts the US military and who supports our current
<br>
missions.
<br>
<p>On the other hand a case to highlight my point -
<br>
<p>Consider that the miliary seeks to avoid combat and that force is the last
<br>
resort of diplomacy.  An AGI would in my opinion be more resourceful in
<br>
preventing combat, by detecting and solving the political problems that
<br>
lead to war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to mention the fact that if a Singularity were to be attempted by ANY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government nation there would be so much special interest represented that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it could never be done safely.  Most likely, it could never be done.
</em><br>
<p>My opinion is the opposite of yours in this regard.  Of course I do not
<br>
want a radical islamic government creating an AGI whose unity of will is
<br>
with gun totting mullahs.  Rather I want the US government
<br>
military/civilian research institutions with whom I am comfortable to
<br>
direct this effort.
