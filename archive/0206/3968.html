<em>&gt; &gt; Space exploration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Due to cost limitations, unless the private sector
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets its act together 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think we can expect to see much in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploration.  The except would be if the Chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pump a lot of money 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into their space program, in which case we'll have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another Space Race 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The energy cost to put 1 kg in orbit is about 20
<br>
kWh, or about $1 at wholesale rates.  It takes
<br>
about 1,000 kg per person to transport people to
<br>
orbit (body mass + chair + share of pressure
<br>
vessel, etc).  So an efficient transportation
<br>
system should run around $1,000 per ticket.
<br>
At the efficiency of commercial airlines, for
<br>
which total costs run around 4 times fuel cost,
<br>
that would be $4,000 a ticket.
<br>
<p>The fact that the going rate is about $20M for
<br>
a ticket is a testament to the poor efficiency
<br>
of current launch systems.  For example, did you
<br>
know the fuel efficiency of a commercial jet
<br>
engine is twenty times that on the Space Shuttle?
<br>
<p>One inexpensive way to send people (and other
<br>
stuff) into space would use a large pneumatic
<br>
tube.  Assume a 30 ton projectile carrying a
<br>
3 ton cargo needs to be accelerated at 6 g's
<br>
(about the limit for humans).  If it's diameter
<br>
is 2.5 meters, the operating pressure is only
<br>
52 psi.  That's why I call it a pneumatic tube
<br>
rather than a gun.  If located on the big island
<br>
of Hawaii (which as a shield volcano has long
<br>
stretches of constant slope mountainside), you
<br>
can get to 2 km/s this way, which is 25% of the
<br>
speed to orbit.  The projectile carries a rocket
<br>
that does the rest of the job of getting to orbit.
<br>
<p>The rather small reduction in the velocity that the
<br>
rocket supplies has a dramatic effect on the cost.
<br>
Without the boost from the tube, the rocket has
<br>
to be 83.7% fuel, 15% structure, and 1.3% cargo.
<br>
With the boost, the figures change to 74.4% fuel,
<br>
18% structure, and 7.6% cargo.  So the fuel-to-
<br>
cargo ratio drops from 64:1 to 10:1.  But more
<br>
importantly, the 20% increase in structural
<br>
weight results in 100 times the service life for
<br>
the vehicle (the fatigue life for aerospace
<br>
structures varies by a factor of 10 for each 10%
<br>
change in stress in the region close to yield
<br>
strength, which is where most of them operate).
<br>
So where the Space Shuttle was designed for 100
<br>
flights, the pneumatic-launched vehicle would
<br>
be good for 10,000 flights (25 years of daily
<br>
launches).
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Having pointed out that space travel can be
<br>
relatively inexpensive if done right, I think it
<br>
will be a moot point to envision a Mars base
<br>
in place by 2030 if the Singularity arrives by
<br>
2020.  Travel will occur at the speed of light
<br>
as your uploaded brain is sent via photons from
<br>
place to place.  The apparent transit time will
<br>
be zero.
