<p>
<em>&gt; Bunge is particularly strong in his formulation of philosophical claims as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical propositions, and on his warranted (in my opinion) dismissals of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most Continental philosophy (from existentialism to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-modernism). I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found quite valuable his summary of outstanding philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be amenable to resolution along the lines he sets out in his books.
</em><br>
<p>Not surprisingly, I hold a different view ;)
<br>
<p>I find his formulation of philosophical claims in logical terms rather
<br>
shallow, and I radically disagree with his dismissal of existentialism and
<br>
postmodernism.
<br>
<p>The existentialists and proto-existentialists dealt with the issue of how to
<br>
think about morality in the absence of a false notion of &quot;objective
<br>
reality,&quot; far better than anyone else has.  I'm thinking of Nietzsche,
<br>
Sartre and Camus, primarily.
<br>
<p>Baudrillard's book &quot;Simulations&quot; (he's a French postmodernist sociologist)
<br>
is the best book on the phenomenology of virtual reality that I know; and
<br>
Foucault (often considered a postmodernist), in his books on prisons,
<br>
schools, and sexuality for instance, has plunged deeper into the perverse
<br>
peculiarity of human nature than just about anyone else.
<br>
<p>To me, accepting only philosophy that can be summed up in concise logical
<br>
propositions is like, well, trying to encode philosophy in CycL!   Just as
<br>
the deepest parts of commonsense knowledge cannot be conveniently encoded in
<br>
compact logical formulas, so the deepest kinds of philosophy cannot be
<br>
conveniently encoded in compact logical formulas.
<br>
<p>What is most interesting to me in late 19'th century &amp; 20'th century
<br>
philosophy is the attempt to forge a middle way between shallow, naive
<br>
rationalism/empiricism (which holds there is a single objective reality, and
<br>
a single right answer to every question), and total nihilism (which is the
<br>
most common conclusion those who reject the existence of objectivity come
<br>
to) -- *without* recourse to superstitious beliefs.  This is existentialism,
<br>
postmodernism, and other assorted freaks like Mikhail Bakhtin (an amazing
<br>
Russian literary critic and philospher, who created a notion of a
<br>
&quot;polyphonic&quot; reality that is neither objective nor solipsistic, but
<br>
collective).
<br>
<p>By putting himself in the &quot;naive objectivist&quot; camp, Bunge makes himself
<br>
completely uninteresting to me.  Refusing to acknowledge the fact that each
<br>
of us lives in our own mind-created world, is just as silly as refusing to
<br>
acknowledge that there is some common reality that we all share.  Embracing
<br>
this Zen koan of subjectivity/objectivity is the real challenge, and will
<br>
become even more of a pertinent challenge as virtual reality and
<br>
superintelligence-inspired reality transformations completely alter reality
<br>
as we know it.
