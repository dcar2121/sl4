<p>It is tempting to do exactly as you suggest (since it would prove the 
<br>
point), but I have better things to do with my time.
<br>
<p>a)  If they think I'm nuts the worst they could do is order a psych 
<br>
evaluation.  I'm not nuts so in a few days (at most) I'm free to do as I wish.
<br>
<p>b)  If they take me seriously they can't jail me because creating an AI is 
<br>
not illegal.  They could work on passing laws to make it illegal but that 
<br>
would take considerable time (possibly years), especially since there is no 
<br>
&quot;obvious&quot; and present danger
<br>
<p>c)  Most likely they would just say &quot;uh huh&quot; and have me escorted out of 
<br>
the building, because they believe they have better things to do with their 
<br>
time...
