<em>&gt;&gt; I meant an awful lot more with software progress than just a bunch of new

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; every language is measured).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a subjective opinion. C# is perfectly good for anything anyone
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>These languages don't represent any kind of progress, they are the flavor of
<br>
the month.  They are no better or worse than yesterday's leftovers.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Why not? Take a look at distributed.net or any similar project. Real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are getting done in a distributed way, more so than ten years ago.
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Distributed&quot; means a lot more than how you are using it.  And ten years
<br>
ago, we had systems capable of doing substantially more powerful (&quot;powerful&quot;
<br>
in an architectural sense, not in terms of available crunch) distributed
<br>
computing than distributed.net.  In fact, I wouldn't even use the term
<br>
&quot;distributed&quot; for distributed.net.   Maybe &quot;cooperative&quot; computing would be
<br>
a better term.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Progress is being made. From the way you're talking, it seems that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just aren't up to date. Check out such things as the MOSIX project (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use this at home). Also, check out Microsoft .NET, and C#. Those are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant progress.
</em><br>
<p><p>.NET and C# is as significant a bit of progress as, umm, well actually it
<br>
isn't.  I can't think of a thing about it that actually represents real
<br>
progress in any meaningful sense.  But at least it isn't Visual Basic.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Do you have anything but your pessamistic curmudgeony old views to back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that up? Ten years ago, there were no standards for applications running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on PCs (I'm talking about MS-DOS). Now, it's possible to create reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programs that will run on any set of platforms, and interoperate, share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data, and so on in ways that hadn't been dreamed of ten years ago, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly even five. Code reuse is lightyears ahead of ten years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With .NET's CTS,  whatever you write in one language can be used in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other with no problems.
</em><br>
<p><p>This sounds a lot like historical myopia.  Bytecode virtual machines go back
<br>
to at least the 1970's (&quot;p-code&quot; anybody?), and C has been the universal
<br>
assembler for a long time (a very large number of languages compiled to
<br>
C-code at one time or another in fact).  The only thing I see written above
<br>
that isn't nearly as old as I am is .NET, which itself is about as original
<br>
as putting butter on toast.
