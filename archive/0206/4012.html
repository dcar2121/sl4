<p>
I just wrote this:
<br>
<em>&gt; I've tried writing some code that manipulates CodeDOMs as well as code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that manipulates human readable C# code for the purposes of execution
</em><br>
time
<br>
<em>&gt; code generation.  So far I have found it to be fairly challenging.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost feel as if there is some useful tool that is still not build
</em><br>
yet.
<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe I just need some more abstract programming concepts such as ADTs
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; functional blocks in a parallel structure to the current CodeDOM?
</em><br>
What do
<br>
<em>&gt; you all think?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm... I really need a better tool to really take advantage of all the
<br>
possibilities that CodeDOM presents.  Basically, I don't really want to
<br>
do run-time code generation -- I want to do development-time code
<br>
generation and refinement.  I want, within my IDE, to be able to write
<br>
environment-aware scripts that can take the CodeDOM of one source file
<br>
and manipulate it according to my whims in order to generate one or more
<br>
other CodeDOMs / source file.  The source file generating scripts
<br>
shouldn't be isolated scripts but scripts that are aware of the whole
<br>
design problem that I am working on -- basically the scripts themselves
<br>
would form a program that one executes to generate one's target program.
<br>
Thus I can modify a few parameters in one area and cause all the scripts
<br>
to function differently.  If the scripts use a high level language such
<br>
as C# the polymorphism presents amazing opportunities. ;-)
<br>
<p>Development in such a generative CodeDOM-aware IDE would be a more
<br>
dynamic and abstract process that what the norm currently is.  This is
<br>
sort of a ramble but hey it's 4am here. ;-)  I think that development is
<br>
implicitly going in this direction anyways even if everyone doesn't
<br>
quite realize it explicitly.
<br>
<p>Does anyone know of other environments/languages that have more fully
<br>
developed this type of development paradigm?
<br>
<p>I hope I make sense.  I should get some sleep. ;-)
