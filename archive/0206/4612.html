<p>I agree with Samantha.  The truth does not have this or that sectarian 
<br>
or philosophical brand on it, it is simply true.  Ben seems to think 
<br>
that truth has the sectarian brand of 'scientific empicirism' on it, and 
<br>
that by telling an AI to select whichever belief system (including 
<br>
atheism) is correct according to correspondence with reality, you are 
<br>
imposing your own views on the rest of the world because you didn't tell 
<br>
the AI to select whichever belief system is correct according to the 
<br>
word of the Bible.
<br>
<p>I think the statement that there is no way to find out that their 
<br>
religion is true - even given ultrapowerful intelligence, very thorough 
<br>
scans of the outside world, and the ability to read human minds - would 
<br>
be rank blasphemy to most deeply religious people.  If Moses really did 
<br>
split the Red Sea a few thousand years ago, and you send your time 
<br>
camera back to take pictures, does the camera come back with false 
<br>
pictures of the Red Sea not being split because the camera was built by 
<br>
empiricists?
<br>
<p>I'm currently hunting through IRC in an effort to find out what actual 
<br>
religious people think about this.  Asking my earlier question about a 
<br>
powerful but nonhuman mind, and whether it could find the correct 
<br>
religion, I got this response:
<br>
<p>&lt;Person1&gt; Are you asking why I believe my religion is correct?
<br>
&lt;Person2&gt; Person1: He's asking you whether it is POSSIBLE to know that 
<br>
your religion is correct.
<br>
&lt;Person1&gt; Buddhism is reason.
<br>
&lt;Person1&gt; I don't think faith is needed to be Buddhist since everything 
<br>
has reason behind it and can be experienced.
