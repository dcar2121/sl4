I think I'm going to have to chime in here...

That's a subjective opinion. C# is perfectly good for anything anyone

would want to do. So is Java, or Eiffel, and so on.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Why not? Take a look at distributed.net or any similar project. Real 
<br>
things are getting done in a distributed way, more so than ten years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can we write secure systems? No. Okay, can we at least write gracefully failing systems? No.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can we generate code to specs automatically? No. Can we design massively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parallel systems, where millions of asynchronous objects distributed over

</em><br>
<em>&gt;as to how break through the complexity bareer, using nonstochastical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;methods (coder monkeys)? No and no.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Progress is being made. From the way you're talking, it seems that you 
<br>
just aren't up to date. Check out such things as the MOSIX project (I 
<br>
use this at home). Also, check out Microsoft .NET, and C#. Those are 
<br>
significant progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There's no need to go on. We haven't had any palpable progress in the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decade, arguably two. In fact, the average code quality is decreasing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;though to different reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Do you have anything but your pessamistic curmudgeony old views to back 
<br>
that up? Ten years ago, there were no standards for applications running 
<br>
on PCs (I'm talking about MS-DOS). Now, it's possible to create reliable 
<br>
programs that will run on any set of platforms, and interoperate, share 
<br>
data, and so on in ways that hadn't been dreamed of ten years ago, or 
<br>
possibly even five. Code reuse is lightyears ahead of ten years ago. 
<br>
With .NET's CTS,  whatever you write in one language can be used in any 
<br>
other with no problems.
