</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that were otherwise impossible, just because it is running on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; silicon???
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why?  Here's a few reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) Totally infallable memory
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily true.  The AI architecture determines memory storage and 
<br>
retrieval, not the hardware.  It is most likely that they will NOT have 
<br>
infallible memory because they will need to delete (forget) details 
<br>
continuously (like we do) in order to stay within their allocated storage 
<br>
capacity.  If at a later time the AI needed some of those details it would 
<br>
either come up blank or attempt to deuce them based on other related 
<br>
details it retained.  Thus their memory would resemble ours much more than 
<br>
that of a computer.  This could, and most likely would, improve over time 
<br>
as more storage capacity became available and as its algorithms 
<br>
improved.  It could have the ability to decide (consciously) what to 
<br>
forget, which *may* be an improvement (or maybe not).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2) 24 x 7 operation, no breaks for body maintenance
</em><br>
<p>I account for this by saying it would be equivalent to 2-3 people.  This 
<br>
could possibly be as many as 10 (since inter-communication would be vastly 
<br>
reduced, which takes much time on large/complex projects).  Or could be as 
<br>
little as 1 if it works more like us and gets burnt-out or bored if working 
<br>
on the same thing 24x7.  No way to tell in advance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3) Improved speed of access to 'canned' facts (Encyclopedias, Google, etc)
</em><br>
<p>This will be the case to some degree, since (for example) I would benefit 
<br>
if I could simply think words instead of typing them.  But this would 
<br>
contribute much less than imagined since most (at least of my time) is 
<br>
spent thinking instead of typing (I've learned to type nearly as fast as I 
<br>
can code, which is somewhere around 75WPM).  Plus I must spend some time in 
<br>
advance (away from a keyboard typically) thinking about architecture and 
<br>
design issues.  Two years ago I produced 350,000 lines of code in one 
<br>
year.  If I didn't have to type I'd guess I could have done 450,000-600,000 
<br>
(at most) since much of my time was spent thinking, designing and 
<br>
communicating (not typing).  So while some speed will be gained here it 
<br>
won't contribute much when it comes to thinking &amp; problem solving.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And by FAR the most important reason for &quot;leaps &amp; bounds&quot; is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;4) Ability to reprogram ones own cognitive processes.
</em><br>
<p>Long term, yes, short term no/maybe.
<br>
<p>See my post: &quot;How to gauge positive progress (was How hard a Singularity?)&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If this isn't enough... then... nuts! --&gt;  Its plenty enough!!
</em><br>
<p>Not when you take my above points into account.  Note that I would *like* 
<br>
this to be enough and I would *love* for all of your points to be 
<br>
absolutely true.  Unfortunately, I don't find it likely.
