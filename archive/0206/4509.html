<p>This appears to state that you believe that kicking off The Singularity is

intrinsically evil.  Is this a correct interpretation of your statement?

</em><br>
<p>Another things that is starting to appear hopeless is your belief in 
<br>
regulation of the Singularity.
<br>
<p>Discussing regulation of *any* up-and-coming technology is pointless.  New 
<br>
technologies move, adapt and change much too quickly for legislatures to 
<br>
deal with.  Only after a technology has matured (is substantially deployed) 
<br>
can it be regulated.  I have provided examples of my view.  I have not seen 
<br>
ANY information in support of your beliefs, however.  Please provide us 
<br>
with a number of concrete examples where effective regulations to govern a 
<br>
technology were passed prior to the release or deployment of the 
<br>
technology.  Note that technologies created by government agencies would be 
<br>
inappropriate and poor examples.
