<p>
I actually disagree that the ability to self-modify an AI architecture
<br>
at some fundamental level is even important, at least in the sense that
<br>
I get the strong impression people are using it.
<br>
<p>The value of deep self-modifying code is apparently premised on the
<br>
first implementations of AGI being duct-taped architectures that barely
<br>
function, due in no small part to their extreme complexity.  My own take
<br>
is that if AGI is actually as complicated as most believe, then the only
<br>
likely and plausible human engineered implementations will almost have
<br>
to be very close approximations of &quot;optimal intelligence&quot; (read: elegant
<br>
and properly generalized models) as a consequence. Compounding this is
<br>
the probable fragility of AGI architectures with respect to the various
<br>
forms of computational complexity, meaning that most design vectors that
<br>
stray away from optimal architectures may not be able to reach seed AI
<br>
level due to tractability problems.  From this perspective, I don't
<br>
think it is unreasonable to assert that architectural self-modification
<br>
is an unnecessary capability as all likely human implementations of an
<br>
AI will almost have to be optimal (or close approximations) to even be
<br>
practical.
<br>
<p>If this is the case and the first &quot;real&quot; AGI architecture is a close
<br>
approximation of optimal, then the qualitative bootstrap process will
<br>
essentially be hardware limited no matter how intelligent the AGI
<br>
actually is.  Obviously there has to be some self-modification at higher
<br>
abstractions or a system couldn't learn, but that doesn't need to impact
<br>
the underlying architecture (and is essentially orthogonal to the
<br>
question in any case).
