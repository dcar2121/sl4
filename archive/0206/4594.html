hi Eugen,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However, by intelligently restricting the grammar of outgoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requests, one can go very far in this direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not see how it helps. You can realtime-block known exploit patterns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you can't meaningfully restrict the requests which happen to remotely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trigger an hitherto unknown vulnerability (though you can probably detect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a blatant brute-force search for buffer overruns -- stealth scans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especialy distributed, fall completely under your radar). As soon as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single vulnerability is found, the entire class of systems (even static
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity is pretty much nonexistant in the current landscape and software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model) is few steps away from being under your control. With current state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the art even moderately smart but distributed attacker can take over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;90% of all online nodes without trying hard.
</em><br>
<p>To me, your arguments are reasons why no security is perfect, but not
<br>
reasons why measure that &quot;help&quot; are impossible
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The Net is a tremendous information resource for a growing AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; baby....  Not using it at all, is simply not an option.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I notice you dismissed most basic security measures I mentioned as way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premature. While I agree that they're currently ridiculous, clearly there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a threshold were they need to be engaged. Do you have a guard in place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triggering on the threshold of some sum of behaviour observables, apart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from what your intuition tells you?
</em><br>
<p>Of course, it is our intuitions that define the sum of behavior observables,
<br>
right?  ;)
<br>
<p>As discussed extensively in my e-mails to Brian, we have such a &quot;guard&quot;
<br>
system designed and will implement and test it prior to running the system
<br>
as an autonomous, goal-directed AI [though we may never get there if I
<br>
continue to spend so much time sending e-mails on this list!!  aha -- now I
<br>
see your strategy!!]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All current search engines maintain large fraction of the web in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cache. I think it should be easy to arrange to have an air-gapped AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading a large fraction of that. Google has been known to try strange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things in R&amp;D. Clearly there's a tremendous market to nave e.g. a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language interface finding facts in iterative user sessions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you tried talking to them? This, of course, also/especially applies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to Cyc.
</em><br>
<p>In fact, I have talked to people at several major search engines recently,
<br>
though not about this issue -- rather, about the possibility of improving
<br>
their search performance with some relatively simple AI tech.
<br>
<p>At the present time, none of them have any serious interest in AI
<br>
technology, nor would they agree to have an experimental AI system interface
<br>
with their DB's.
<br>
<p>Also, the search engines don't always retain the full text of pages they
<br>
index; in many cases they just retain an 'index' of the page...
<br>
<p>This kind of partnership is of great interest to me, but we'll have to
<br>
demonstrate that Novamente can somehow be useful to *them* before they'll be
<br>
interested in such a partnership.  This means we'll have to have a Novamente
<br>
that can do something useful with human natural language.  Based on our
<br>
teaching programme, this means it will occur *after* the system has a modest
<br>
level of infrahuman AGI -- because we don't plan to force-feed it English
<br>
language knowledge, but rather to *teach* it English...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If a diverse committee of transhumanist-minded individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreed that going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ahead with a Novamente-lauchned singularity was a very bad idea, then, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would not do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fair enough. Notice that transhumanists are self-selected. If you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consult a commitee of Singularitarians that believe that Singularity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inherently good, whether we people make it, or not, then your answer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely predictable. It is very easy to engineer the outcome towards what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want to hear by jiggling the composition, and apply what constitutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an acceptable and unacceptable member.
</em><br>
<p>I actually don't know anyone who thinks the Singularity should be gone ahead
<br>
with full-speed even if it seems likely to extinct humanity.  I think this
<br>
hypothesized guy may be one of those &quot;straw men&quot; you read about sometimes ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture: longterm evolution is intrinsically unknowable. Cumulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilities is an extremely naive model.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed...
