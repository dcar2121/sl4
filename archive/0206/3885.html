<p>That's what the books for.  ;-)
<br>
<p>Most of this has been covered before, but since there has never been an 
<br>
&quot;Examples of Irrational Thought&quot; e-mail, I guess it's okay.
<br>
<p>So, broadly speaking, irrational thought is when you fail to think 
<br>
logically about a situation and make decisions based purely on what you 
<br>
feel or based on some rationalization because you want some conclusion x 
<br>
to be true (keeping in mind that there is the exception Ben discussed 
<br>
that you use when it's not really clear what to do so you just decide 
<br>
something and go with it, keeping in mind that you just decided it for 
<br>
not a particularly good reason).
<br>
<p>Here are some specific examples:
<br>
<p>You are in college and need to take a class in general relativity.  You 
<br>
notice, though, that there are lots of members of the opposite sex in 
<br>
that oral communication class.  In fact, there's one person in there you 
<br>
like a lot and would like to get to know better.  Taking that class will 
<br>
set you back in your academic career.  Assuming that you are in college 
<br>
to learn and get some kind of degree, choosing to take the oral 
<br>
communication class because it might let you get to know someone better 
<br>
is an irrational decision.
<br>
<p>You have a job providing tech support.  After many days working and 
<br>
thinking about how bad your job is when you get home, you realize that 
<br>
Grand Theory X would justify you being rude to the customers and you'd 
<br>
be a lot happier.  The first trap of irrationality is acting on Grad 
<br>
Theory X without having proven it.  If you get past that, there are 
<br>
others.  So, you are sitting around trying to prove Grand Theory X and 
<br>
start to come up with reasons that it must be true.  After a while you 
<br>
have a whole bunch of reasons that, while they sound a bit implausible 
<br>
at times, justify Grand Theory X in your eyes.  That's rationalization, 
<br>
another form of irrational thought.  Telling the difference between 
<br>
rationalization and a logical progression of ideas is easy if you know 
<br>
for what to look.  If you are rationalizing, you start with a conclusion 
<br>
and seek out evidence to support that conclusion.  Unless you have a 
<br>
well trained mind, you'll ignore the counter evidence and conclude that 
<br>
your conclusion is in fact true.  Logical thought occurs when you have 
<br>
some evidence and you get a conclusion from that.  Or, possibly, you 
<br>
have a conclusion and you have some evidence and after sitting around 
<br>
from a long time and thinking hard and trying to come up with counter 
<br>
examples and failing, you find that the evidence really does support 
<br>
some conclusion (more likely a slightly different conclusion than what 
<br>
you started with).
<br>
<p>When you are trying to find a reason why your conclusion is true, you 
<br>
being to feel like you are straining to come up with support.  Stop 
<br>
right there.  If you don't know, you don't know, so don't make something 
<br>
up, because whatever you make up is not helpful and will confuse 
<br>
matters, an irrational choice.  If you have been rationalizing, you'll 
<br>
hopefully get this strained feeling when your reasons turn out to be 
<br>
excuses.
<br>
<p>You have a big test tomorrow and need to study for it.  Right in the 
<br>
middle of studying, your girlfriend shows up and wants your attention 
<br>
(ahem!).  The rational choice is to keep studying, because in the long 
<br>
run doing well on a test and learning material are more important than 
<br>
making out.
<br>
<p>You are playing a gambling game.  You have $500 dollars.  First you are 
<br>
given a choice:  you can either be given another $100 or you can try to 
<br>
win $500 more, but if you don't win, you get nothing.  It doesn't matter 
<br>
what the odds are, $100 is almost always the more rational choice 
<br>
because it guaranteed and most people will pick that one.  Then you are 
<br>
given a second choice:  you can either lose $100 or play a game where 
<br>
you might not lose any money, but if you loose you'll lose $500.  Most 
<br>
people will pick the latter in this case, which is an irrational 
<br>
choice.  The situation is the same as the first time, the only thing 
<br>
that changed was the sign on the numbers.  (example paraphrased from one 
<br>
in CFAI)
<br>
<p>There are plenty of others.  They all stem from the same issue:  letting 
<br>
your upgraded ape brain make all the decisions for your mind which is 
<br>
capable of rational thought.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that my examples assume a certain goal system.  That is, a 
<br>
goal system that wants to accomplish something meaningful in the world 
<br>
and contribute to it.  If you're goal in life is to just have fun, it is 
<br>
completely possible for you to be a rational person and make all your 
<br>
decisions with the objective of having fun.  If you starting thinking 
<br>
about ideas and doing things that were not fun, you would be acting 
<br>
irrationally.
<br>
<p>I'm sorry if I haven't articulated as clearly as I'd like to.  I'm sure 
<br>
with time I can think up some really good examples that will make people 
<br>
say &quot;ahh, so that's what irrational thought is!&quot;.
