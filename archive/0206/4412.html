</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weren't answerable to or involved in their development work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Such a committee should be formed and at least made available for other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; projects to utilize.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;I think that a broader discussion group should *also* be assembled,

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;This committee should be assembled in order to gather its opinions only,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;without a view toward decision-making.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An excellent idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OK, so we basically do agree on this....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree that a such an advisory committee would work best if not tied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specifically to any one AI project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, if such a thing were not convened by a group concerned with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;particular AI project, then by whom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The SIAI, in my view, is not really a general organization for &quot;AGI and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity,&quot; it's an organization largely (though not entirely) devoted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eliezer's particular approach to AGI and to Friendly AI.  Perhaps that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not how it is intended, but that's how it comes across to me....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It would be good to have something sorta like the SIAI, but explicitly NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tied to any one AI approach, or any one approach to Friendliness....  Such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an organization could be used to advocate the Singularity notion, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time to convene this advisory committee that you've proposed...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Specifically, this organization should not fund any AGI research directly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and though it might support work on the theory of the Singularity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendliness, it should aspire to be as open-minded as possible in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regard rather than developing a &quot;pet theory&quot;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, I don't think there's any tremendous urgency to start such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organization this year.  Sometime in the next 2-3 years would be good.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- Ben G
</em><br>
<p>I agree with what you have said, including the time line.  In fact, if 
<br>
Eliezer were to agree with this idea I would consider progress having been 
<br>
made on this front.  Espicially if the two of you were willing to be on the 
<br>
board to start things rolling when the time comes.  The only trick after 
<br>
that would be to keep the meme going until the time was appropriate.
