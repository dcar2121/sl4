<p>I do not see how it helps. You can realtime-block known exploit patterns,
<br>
but you can't meaningfully restrict the requests which happen to remotely
<br>
trigger an hitherto unknown vulnerability (though you can probably detect
<br>
a blatant brute-force search for buffer overruns -- stealth scans,
<br>
especialy distributed, fall completely under your radar). As soon as a
<br>
single vulnerability is found, the entire class of systems (even static
<br>
diversity is pretty much nonexistant in the current landscape and software
<br>
model) is few steps away from being under your control. With current state
<br>
of the art even moderately smart but distributed attacker can take over
<br>

</em><br>
<p>I notice you dismissed most basic security measures I mentioned as way
<br>
premature. While I agree that they're currently ridiculous, clearly there
<br>
is a threshold were they need to be engaged. Do you have a guard in place
<br>
triggering on the threshold of some sum of behaviour observables, apart
<br>
from what your intuition tells you?
<br>

<em>&gt; One option we've considered is to create a huge mirror of a large
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mucho dinero!
</em><br>
<p>All current search engines maintain large fraction of the web in their
<br>
cache. I think it should be easy to arrange to have an air-gapped AI
<br>
reading a large fraction of that. Google has been known to try strange
<br>
things in R&amp;D. Clearly there's a tremendous market to nave e.g. a natural
<br>
language interface finding facts in iterative user sessions.
<br>
<p>Have you tried talking to them? This, of course, also/especially applies 
<br>
to Cyc.

<em>&gt; If a diverse committee of transhumanist-minded individuals agreed that going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead with a Novamente-lauchned singularity was a very bad idea, then, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not do it.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough. Notice that transhumanists are self-selected. If you would
<br>
consult a commitee of Singularitarians that believe that Singularity is
<br>
inherently good, whether we people make it, or not, then your answer is
<br>
entirely predictable. It is very easy to engineer the outcome towards what
<br>
you want to hear by jiggling the composition, and apply what constitutes
<br>
an acceptable and unacceptable member.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I honestly do not believe we're *ever* going to be able to reduce &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability that an AI goes rogue at some point in the far future&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than .01%, with any meaningful degree of confidence.  This kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of certainty is not going to be available pre-Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. In fact the error range you cited is quite absurd. Because far
<br>
future is not so far removed for human observers at superrealtime (factor
<br>
of ~10^6) rates, even small probabilities do cumulate. A simplistic
<br>
picture: longterm evolution is intrinsically unknowable. Cumulating
<br>
probabilities is an extremely naive model.
