<p>Good, I can accept a reality in which I'm personally deluded, deranged, or 
<br>
such but the human race is, in fact, safe.  Of course, that means I would 
<br>
continue to argue my viewpoint indefinitely...
<br>
<p>Luckily, I don't believe that I am deluded or deranged.  Thus you may 
<br>
someday change my mind if you are correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My &quot;inability to concede that others could be correct where I am wrong&quot; is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phrased in such a way as to evoke a visualization of debate as a social 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;ideas because they are others', rather than because negative evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outweighed positive evidence&quot;.  But in any case that is also your imagination.
</em><br>
<p>My intention was not to evoke a visualization of debate as a social 
<br>
game.  If I did such please consider it a mistake as this is no game.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you repeat these accusations indefinitely, it does not make them any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more true, and I hope that the readers on SL4 will read my writings and 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;has been repeated often enough.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I at least endeavor to provide new reasons, concepts, arguments, etc. 
<br>
to support my view.  Thus I will not, at least intentionally, repeat a 
<br>
static argument over and over.  Though I do reserve the right to continue 
<br>
arguing for my point as long as I think doing so has value.  Which has a 
<br>
built-in safe guard in that I have much to do and little time to do it, so 
<br>
I'll only spend significant time on this while I think it is doing (or has 
<br>
potential to do) good.
