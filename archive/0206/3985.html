<p>
Kurzweil, however, IS putting effort into helping people understand the
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>And I'm sure that part of his motivation for doing this, is a desire to
<br>
nudge the Singularity in a better direction.  A direction not too thoroughly
<br>
polluted by peoples' fear and uncomprehension.
<br>
<p>He is not involved directly in technical work building toward the
<br>
Singularity, because he has judged that he can make a more unique and
<br>
powerful contribution by helping to engineer peoples' *attitudes* toward the
<br>
Singularity.  And I suspect he's probably right; I don't doubt his
<br>
self-understanding on this point.  He would seem to have reached the stage
<br>
that many &quot;elder&quot; scientists reach, wherein philosophy becomes more
<br>
attractive than technical work.
<br>
<p>I do think he underestimates the degree to which more directly
<br>
Singularity-focused technical work could accelerate and improve the path
<br>
toward the Singularity.  Yes, I wish he was putting some of his cash into
<br>
SIAI and Novamente and A2I2 and a host of other Singularity-ish projects.
<br>
However, compared to what other techno-millionaires are doing with their
<br>
wealth and their time and their minds, I think Kurzweil's efforts are not
<br>
too shabby.

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  &gt; You're right.  I do quote him a lot.  But that is only because he has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; written a lot that is relevant to this discussion.  I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  new book to come out.  Does anyone know when it is due?  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  that I agree with everything he says or that I am a Kurzweil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groupie but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  don't you think the human race is lucky to have someone like Ray
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Kurzweil looking out for it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kurzweil is a futurist, not an activist.  He argues that the Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *will* occur.  As far I know he is not putting any effort into making it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur.  He believes it is inevitable.  So much for that.
