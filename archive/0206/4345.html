<em>&gt;  The interesting part is that I have little actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with academia vs experience in industry.  Maybe we just do things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently out here in Arizona.  ;)  Makes me wonder if I should try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get more involved with Academia.  Then again ASU isn't exactly a stellar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model for Computer Science (it is, after all, one of the nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top party
</em><br>
<em>&gt; schools!).  :(
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James Higgins
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, about getting involved with academia, here's the thing...
<br>
<p>If you want to very thoroughly learn very narrow, highly technical material,
<br>
universities are great.  There are brilliant people there doing deep &amp;
<br>
fascinating work on important topics.  Even at a university that's not
<br>
highly rated, nearly every department is bound to have a handful of really
<br>
brilliant people doing amazing things.
<br>
<p>However, if you want creative, long-term-oriented, out-of-the-box (to use an
<br>
annoying phrase) thinking -- and if you want your own interesting,
<br>
speculative, maybe not yet fully-based ideas to be taken at all seriously --
<br>
academia is definitely *not* the place.
<br>
<p>It is possible to get normal academic scientists interested in out-there
<br>
stuff like AGI and the Singularity, but it takes a lot of social art &amp;
<br>
science (I'm better at this than many, but still learning for sure).  It's
<br>
*especially* hard if you're not a professor yourself; most professors
<br>
(except those who have spent a lot of their careers outside academia) have a
<br>
very hard time taking seriously any idea that did not originate with another
<br>
professor, and that is not presented in the manner typical of academia
<br>
(modest impersonal tone, ample &amp; current references, etc.).
<br>
<p>I'm glad I got my PhD, because sitting through years of technical math
<br>
coursework was invaluable to me.  On my own I would not have had the
<br>
patience to do all the exercises needed to master that much math; I would
<br>
have skimmed things over more quickly, eager to get to the parts directly
<br>
relevant to my current research ideas.  However, I'm also glad that I never
<br>
fully absorbed the &quot;academic mindset&quot;, in which the most important thing is
<br>
to generate results that can be published in popular journals on a roughly
<br>
semiannaul basis.
<br>
<p>Just as business overfocuses on quarterly profits, academic researchers
<br>
overfocus on keeping a steady stream of &quot;acceptable&quot; papers coming out
<br>
(where &quot;acceptable&quot; refers not only to quality but also to conformity of
<br>
research topic).  Neither of these short-term focii is optimal for long-term
<br>
progress in new domains.
<br>
<p>Overall, the current US academic process and mentality is pretty good at
<br>
filtering out ultra-dumb ideas and loony people (at least in the sciences,
<br>
I'm not going to give you my rant on the state of the social sciences, which
<br>
is a lot more spotty ;), but is very bad at encouraging innovation and
<br>
long-term creative thinking...
<br>
<p>Having said this (and having taught at a couple overseas universities and
<br>
visited many more), I do think the US graduate education system is the best
<br>
in the world.  We monkeys just aren't that good at building productive
<br>
organizations of any kind, unfortunately...
<br>
