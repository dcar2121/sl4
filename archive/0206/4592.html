<p>You seem awfully certain about that.  (Heh.  I finally got to use that
<br>
line.)
<br>
<p>Ben, you're a member of a species that has spent the last few hundred
<br>
thousand years arguing politics and morality with occasional pauses to
<br>
eat and sleep.  Is it really that strange if I suggest that there are
<br>
complex functional adaptations which influence your choice of
<br>
declarative moral beliefs?
<br>
<p>This is actually a rather Zen situation; you have meta-ethics but you
<br>
don't know you have meta-ethics.  I wish now I had some formal training
<br>
in Zen methods of getting people to realize that they possess a
<br>
subjective experience by just having them *see* it, without a lot of
<br>
verbal argument.
<br>
<p>Let's start with a moral question.  Some people even today, though
<br>
thankfully not as many as there a few generations ago, believe that
<br>
people of certain races (or at least, what they regard as &quot;races&quot;) are
<br>
intrinsically worth less than others.  You have a different morality
<br>
under which race makes no difference to intrinsic worth.  Now I'm not
<br>
asking you why you believe these other people are wrong, because if so
<br>
you'll just answer &quot;Because their morality conflicts with mine&quot;; rather
<br>
I'm asking you why you don't share their morality.  If morality is
<br>
genuinely arbitrary then one mapping of sentiences to intrinsic value is
<br>
as good as any other; why is your morality different from theirs?
