<p>I don't think the Singularity could, even possibly, be slowed down to take 
<br>
a decade.  If for no other reason that some other group (probably several, 
<br>
actually) will also be working on it and at least one of them will go for 
<br>
the hard-takeoff option (or will botch the slowdown).  Somewhat slower, 
<br>
however, should be strongly considered.  The more we (humanity) can keep 
<br>
and eye on the progression and guide it the better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Singularity; the Singularity doesn't come in a &quot;soft&quot; version that

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;You're arguing that you can influence the onset, but not the general shape
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It is, unfortunately, most likely that we won't be able to greatly 
<br>
influence the shape of the Singularity.  Scares the heck out of me, but I 
<br>
still don't see it otherwise.  Unless we could somehow manage to 
<br>
continually upgrade a handful of HIGHLY TRUSTED humans to at least somewhat 
<br>
keep pace with the Singularity I don't see how its possible.  And I haven't 
<br>
heard of any real options for doing that...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I would call it dead certain in favor of a hard takeoff, unless all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligences at the core of that hard takeoff unanimously decide 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wonders have been known to happen.
</em><br>
<p>I truly hope we get one of those when the time is right...

<p><em>&gt; &gt;   All economic, computational, and, as far as I can tell, moral indicators

</em><br>
<em>&gt;My moral indicator might be broken, but I don't see how activities

</em><br>
<p>Well, Eliezer has a problem with people dying.  The longer your wait to get 
<br>
the Singularity in full force the more people die (that's my interpretation 
<br>
of his vision, at least).  Personally, I'd rather let a few hundred 
<br>
thousand people die while making certain that the Singularity won't just 
<br>
wipe everyone out.  I mean, what's the point in rushing to save lives if 
<br>
everyone gets converted into computronium anyway?  My best guess is that 
<br>
the final result will be somewhere in between (but probably closer to 
<br>
Eliezer's wishes than I'd like).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; fall through to much faster substrate than our 200Hz neurons.  The closest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we might come to a slow Singularity is if the first transhumans are pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; biological humans, in which case it might take a few years for them to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI, brain-computer interfaces, or computer-mediated broadband telepathy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 64-node clustered humans, but my guess is that the first transhumans would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; head for more powerful Singularity technologies straight out of the gate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I should hope not. It would seem to be much more ethical to offer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assistance to those yet unmodified to get onboard, while you're still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;encrusted with the nicer human artifacts and the player delta has not yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grown sufficiently large that empathy gets eroded into indifference.
</em><br>
<p>Here I'm split.  Personally, I think if we try and wait that long we're 
<br>
making a major mistake.  There are STILL people who aren't comfortable with 
<br>
computers today.  To try and get humanity &quot;on-board&quot; the Singularity would 
<br>
take centuries, which we don't have.  The most moral (in my opinion) option 
<br>
is to create the  Singularity as fast as possible while maintaining a 
<br>
strong measure of safety (ie: non-extinction, slavery, indifference, 
<br>
etc).  And yes, I know actual slavery would be pointless (we would be 
<br>
useless junk to an SI).  But we could be &quot;slaves&quot; by loosing much of our 
<br>
freedom &amp; choice, which is too likely.  But, as mentioned earlier, I don't 
<br>
think we'll actually get this option (due to the Eliezers out there).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; very little point in trying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once again we disagree. There's tremendous point in trying if human lifes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are at stake.
</em><br>
<p>While I doubt we'll get the chance for a moderate takeoff, we should be ALL 
<br>
MEANS try.  It is never pointless to try and protect the entire human race!
