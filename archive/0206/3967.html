<em>&gt; &gt; But don't forget, 100 years ago theoretical physics also looked like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was pretty much dead.  Everything was understood, more or less.  Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; along comes general relativity and quantum mechanics.  Oops, guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was some stuff we didn't know.  I'm sure any TOE we come up with will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stubbed by new discoveries.  And, if we can't find any, then we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have to create a new universe and start playing with that.  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	No, relativity and quantum mechanics were introduced to explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomena that were observed but not understood. Physics did not look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'dead' to anyone that was remotely interested in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p><p>In the late 1800's, prior to Planck's experimental work on radiation, and
<br>
prior to the discovery of the Michelson-Morley effect, leading physicists
<br>
*did* declare that &quot;physics was over, except for putting a few more values
<br>
of precision on constants.&quot;  I don't have the quote handy, but there's a
<br>
famous one from a leading physicist (whom I believe was an administrator at
<br>
the university where Michelson made his discoveries).
<br>
<p>Then, as the turn of the century neared, new experimental discoveries were
<br>
made, leading to new theories, and surprising a lot of people.
<br>
<p>This is not controversial, it's the standard history of physics!
