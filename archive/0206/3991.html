<p>Yes, if a deductive inference engine and symbolic knowledge representation
<br>
repository were essential for Seed AI, then I agree that less than 20K
<br>
lines of java code would be required, especially if a relational database
<br>
were the object store.  It would compare very poorly to Cyc but might be
<br>
enough for Seed AI, given the assumption that shallow deductive inference
<br>
would be the requirement.  A substantial portion of the Cyc code base is
<br>
motivated by computational linguistics, and I am leaving that
<br>
behavior aside.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So I believe that the creation of Seed AI is far beyond the capability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a single individual, and that belief is my motivation for working at
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a flawed belief in that it appears to be based solely on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; premise of your experience with Cyc. If you don't think the Cyc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture is directly pertinent to AGI (and many don't), then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes a null data point.
</em><br>
<p>Well yes, I agree that my Cyc experience can be discarded for those who
<br>
doubt our approach.  Yet add my experience to that reported by other AI
<br>
projects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My personal meaningless guess with respect to the ceiling for the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of lines of compiler code required to generate an AGI is about 50,000.
</em><br>
<p>My question to you then would be: Given a budget of 50K LOC, just what
<br>
behaviors would you require the system to have?  Or if your base system
<br>
merely accepts knowledge for the next layer up, how many person-years of
<br>
effort at that next layer would be required to achieve Seed AI, and what
<br>
behaviors would be taught to the system with this budget.
<br>
<p>All the implementers on this list gain from a discussion of the
<br>
essential Seed AI behaviors, regardless of how we achieve those behaviors
<br>
in a software system.
<br>
<p>Is reading important?  What kinds of machine learning are required? Does
<br>
automated reasoning require justifications/explanations?  What are the key
<br>
attributes of a goal? ...
