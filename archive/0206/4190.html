<p>You seem to somehow assume you can understand it. Here's your DNA sequence
<br>
on a CDROM. Please give me the diffs necessary to give you four arms and
<br>
gills, and a neocortex twice your current size. (Hey, sometimes size does
<br>
matter).

<p><em>&gt; been thinking about &quot;what I'm gonna do after I upload&quot; for a long time

<p>Okay, you're uploaded. I'm giving you full r/w access to /dev/mem (which
<br>
is a very large bitvector and about every bit flips on microsecond scale)  
<br>
and the full GNU tool suite. Do your worst.
<br>
<p>Sure, that was unfair. Wait, here's your 3d voxelset image describing your
<br>
brain at ultrastructure scale with full dynamics. For all practical
<br>
purposes you can assume a 1:1 mapping to physics (transmembrane gradient,
<br>
ion gating action, diffusion, genome network, protein interaction matrix,
<br>
etc). The toolbox you're given involves zooming, complete r/w access to
<br>
the 3d array, etc.
<br>
<p>What are you going to do with this? How long do you think you need to
<br>
build the tools to analyze this, and how many virtually drooling idiots
<br>
are going to document your failures in self engineering?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; now.  First on my list is: Make a backup copy.  Second: Work on

<p>A static copy doesn't do very well if you've managed to screw yourself up
<br>
during fancy neurosurgery. What you need is periodically dumping state,
<br>
and periodic reactivation of your former state, with voting rights on
<br>
whether to make the new diff permanent.
