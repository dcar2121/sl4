<p>Dam!  I haven't laughed that hard in YEARS!  Laws?  Are you really serious?
<br>
<p>I bet you believe in gun control too (because we all know if you outlaw all 
<br>
guns then criminals won't use them, right?).
<br>
<p>Why the HELL would anyone working on the Singularity obey the law?  By the 
<br>
time anyone even realized that they didn't it would be too late.  Not to 
<br>
mention the fact that it takes government bodies YEARS to understand 
<br>
moderately complicated technology.  Look at the Internet for an example, 
<br>
many government bodies still don't get it; and that is based on 20+ year 
<br>
old technology...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Once again, we're talking about avoiding specific developments. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relevant threat for this forum is runaway superintelligence, a Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turned Blight and death of us all due to side effects.
</em><br>
<p>Do you suppose the superintelligence will obey the laws too?  (sorry, 
<br>
couldn't resist)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Don't expect a specific scenario. The more specific it is, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrelevant. What we could do is draft broad guidelines, which necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to be adaptive in nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I told you the inhibiting aspects: regulating, tracking, enforcing. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not pretty, nor does it guarantee 100% success, but it's a lot better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than nothing. Talk to your friendly molecular biologist working in Level 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facilities how they're coping with the regulation load. Remember that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporal scope of the regulations is limited, the hard limit being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;late stages of Singularity, which will shrug off any regulations imposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by previour players due to raising power gradient.
</em><br>
<p>And these regulations is why there have never been any bio-terrorism 
<br>
problems?  Oh wait, there have been.  Well, all it would take is ONE 
<br>
Singularity incident and that's it.  Thinking that ANY regulation could 
<br>
have ANY noticeable effect on this problem is ridiculous.  Unless you plan 
<br>
to take away everyone's computers and closely observe what is being done 
<br>
with the few computers you do allow.  Is that what you are proposing?
<br>
<p>My apologies, in advance, to the list for not playing nice in this post.  I 
<br>
just couldn't believe this is a serious suggestion.
