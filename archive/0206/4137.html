hi brian,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; See Eugen this is one of the major complaints people around these parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably have regarding your ideas. They are based on things you wish for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but don't seem to really exist or work in reality. I know you WISH we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had working cryonics, perfect anti-aging and disease prevention tech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone had their own mini space colony, but none of this seems likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to happen any time soon.
</em><br>
<p>But brian, it is certainly plausible to say anti-aging drugs and cryonics
<br>
will work some time soon -- just as plausible as to say this about AI.
<br>
<p>I happen to think that real AI can happen a lot faster than truly effective
<br>
anti-aging drugs.  But these are for intuitive rather than rigorous reasons.
<br>
I think AI can happen soon because I think I know how to build one, and just
<br>
need some time and money to do it (the amount of time being decreased if the
<br>
amount of money becomes greater ;).
<br>
<p>I think aging research will go frustratingly slowly, because human aging in
<br>
itself is not a rapid thing to study (it takes a long time to run tests
<br>
involving humans, and it's relatively slow even on other mammals).
<br>
<p>I think cryonics could probably be mastered fairly quickly if a lot of $$
<br>
were put into it.  the remaining problems have to do with things like
<br>
&quot;inventing a very fast way of heating up tissue&quot; and &quot;creating drugs to
<br>
counteract the toxic effects of cryoprotectants,&quot; which intrinsically seem
<br>
like easier problems than those of AI or truly effectiveanti-aging.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I don't think Eugen is guilty of wishful thinking regarding
<br>
cryonics, space travel or anti-aging, any more than Eli and you and I are
<br>
guilty of wishful thinking regarding AI!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile, rather than admit that there just might be a /possibility/ of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixing all this via an AI technology that can be built and tested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a way as to be likely less risky than letting human uploads run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wild, you aren't interested in even seriously investigating.
</em><br>
<p>I have thought about this very seriously and I think that superhuman AI is a
<br>
MORE risky path than human uploads.  There are a lot more unknowns with
<br>
superhuman AI; we are dealing with a different sort of embodiment AND a
<br>
different sort of mind all at once.
<br>
<p>However, I think the greater rewards are more than commensurate with the
<br>
greater risks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do have differing reality models, and yours seems based on an utter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surety that AI must go evil or uncaring (or at least we can't tell what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will happen).
</em><br>
<p>To me, utter surety that AI will go evil or uncaring is foolish.  But so is
<br>
surety that AI can be made good or caring thru appropriate education or
<br>
engineering.
<br>
<p>Accept the unknowability of the future.  We must do the best we can, but,
<br>
should guard against overestimating the likely effectiveness of our
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p>Anyway, all in all, I don't agree with Eugen's perspective either, Brian.
<br>
It seems to combine, among other features
<br>
<p>a) skepticism about actually building real AI any time soon
<br>
b) kurzweil-ish optimism about eventual exact human brain simulation
<br>
c) fear of what real AI may do
<br>
d) faith in the ability of laws to restrain the advent of dangerous
<br>
technologies
<br>
<p>I agree with him that exact brain simulation will be possible before too
<br>
long, and I agree with him that a bad outcome from superhuman AI is a real
<br>
possibility.  But I doubt laws will be effective at constraining global tech
<br>
development, and of course I'm not an AI skeptic.
<br>
<p>But I don't know why I'm spending time partially defending Eugen; if I
<br>
recall correctly, about a year ago he said he was putting me in his killfile
<br>
so he wouldn't have to read my e-mails anymore, with their offensive AI
<br>
optimism ;&gt;
<br>
