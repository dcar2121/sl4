<p>
yo,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Foucault,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose historical researches--upon which he based his analysis of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions--have been refuted by people who know more about the periods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and institutions about which he wrote.
</em><br>
<p>Those debates are ongoing; I do not agree at all that Foucault's historical
<br>
conclusions have been convincingly refuted, except in some minor cases.  But
<br>
to argue this stuff would be out of place on SL4 I suppose ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll grant that Foucault did have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable first hand-knowledge of human perversity, as evidenced by his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral obtuseness regarding HIV (i.e., he knew he was infected but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to his promiscuous lifestyle nevertheless and without informing his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partners).
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I don't require a person to be morally admirable, in order to find
<br>
their ideas interesting!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bunge's &quot;naive&quot; realism/objectivism is, as I said, one-sided but, to me, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed corrective to the radical subjectivism that has come to dominate in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many academic departments. You wrote that we live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mind-created world&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we must acknowledge along with &quot;some common reality that we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share.&quot; Do you consider this common reality to be a mind-consensus or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective reality that exists apart from human observers? (Do we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear that tree fall in order for it to make a noise?)
</em><br>
<p>I think that these words &amp; phrases like &quot;mind-consensus&quot; and &quot;objective
<br>
reality&quot; are part of a cultural game we play, and that they're all very poor
<br>
at capturing the nature of things.
<br>
<p>I also think that notions as abstract as this are incredibly hard to
<br>
communicate about, so it may often be the case that people who think they
<br>
disagree are saying the same thing in completely different languages...
<br>
<p>I guess this means I sympathize with Wittgenstein's later period more than
<br>
with the Tractatus... though Novamente (my AI system) is somewhat
<br>
Tractatus-inspired with its Atoms ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would distinguish between changes to a virtual reality content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (software)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and changes to the underlying substrate (hardware/objective reality). Both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can and will be changed by superintelligence. But I think that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence that loses controlling contact over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be superceded by another superintelligence that does not.
</em><br>
<p>And how do you know there IS any material substrate?  How do you know you're
<br>
not in a simulation right now, which is running in another simulation, which
<br>
is running in another simulation?  You can't.  The best you can do is have
<br>
faith.
<br>
<p>You can say &quot;I know this stone is real because I kick it and it hurts,&quot; but
<br>
that could be the case in a simulation too, and the evil scientist running
<br>
the simulation could switch it off in 5 seconds.
<br>
<p>This is elementary stuff, but realist philosophers don't seem to get it.
<br>
This kind of denial of the obvious reminds me of religious doctrines, which
<br>
is why realist philosophy often reminds me of a religion.
<br>
<p><p>- Ben G
