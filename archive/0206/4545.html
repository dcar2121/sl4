Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this is so then some forms of spirituality with their strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emphasis on stepping beyond individual ego identification and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even teaching means of doing so may actually have a bit of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage over the type of agnostic or atheist materialists who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are firmly identified with their current state, ego and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personality structures.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree with this...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   One hopes.  :-)  The AI will find flaws in modern science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some aspects of the philosophy of science as well as in much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else that came before it.
</em><br>
<p>That is true.  And how the typical empiricist/rationalist human mind will
<br>
react to an AI telling them empiricism and rationalism are wrong... well,
<br>
this will be interesting to see, if it comes to pass!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  From the point of view of a Muslim mystic, a Muslim (or anyone)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that thinks/intuits/experiences Truth in so limited a fashion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the true infidel.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>It is true, of course.  But the vast majority of Muslims are not Sufis!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I found LSD a useful tool for understanding how my
<br>
<em>&gt; current personality and other constructs were put together,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blowing them apart and having some degree of freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconstruct in a way that seemed, well, &quot;better&quot;.  After a while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it felt as if I went to pretty much the same sorts of states and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw infinite reiterations of the same basic information.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble was actually making use of what was learned there in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;real&quot; world. It wasn't scary for me because my sense of, not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much identity as center, was deeper or different from or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluid than most.  I believe this sort of fluidity is indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential as the world and one's very self changes more and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly.
</em><br>
<p>Right, so you see what I mean -- a sense of the &quot;fluidity&quot; of self and
<br>
being -- this is what I think will be helpful in making the transition from
<br>
humanity to transhumanity.
<br>
<p>This transition will be totally different from an LSD trip, but will be
<br>
similar in that it will involve an out-of-the-ordinary insight into how
<br>
one's self, personality and beliefs are put together.
<br>
<p>Part of what LSD does is lets you see parts of your mind that are normally
<br>
blocked off from your perception.  Unfortunately, it also *distorts* your
<br>
perception of everything, so the insights it gives you are often badly
<br>
tainted....  When becoming transhuman, we will see all that and much, much
<br>
more...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
