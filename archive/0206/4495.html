Hi Brian,
<br>
<p>First of all, as I stressed in my previous e-mail, that brief essay entitled
<br>
&quot;Thoughts on AI Morality&quot; is exactly that -- some thoughts on AI morality.
<br>
It is not a systematic manifesto outlining the Novamente project's complete
<br>
approach to AI morality.  Maybe I will write such a thing -- *after* I'm
<br>
done with this damnable Novamente book project.  In other words, my essay is
<br>
much shorter and much less ambitious than Eliezer's CFAI document.
<br>
Furthermore the thoughts in it are probably  much more amenable to change
<br>
than Eli's ideas in CFAI, because I have definitely not spent as much time
<br>
on these issues as Eli has.
<br>
<p>I'm sorry I didn't write the Novamente AI Morality manifesto yet... but,
<br>
y'know, perhaps if I were being personally funded by a philanthropist, who
<br>
wanted me to write about this stuff, then I would have ;) .  As it is, I'm
<br>
focusing on actually creating the AGI, both
<br>
<p>-- because I think that's the most important thing for me to focus on, and
<br>
<p>-- because I'm counting on the biological-data-analysis applications of
<br>
Novamente to feed myself, my wife and my 3 kids over the next few years.
<br>
<p>Writing a manifesto on AI Morality is not going to feed the family, AND it's
<br>
also not going to do the world any more good than writing it a year or two
<br>
from now, when Novababy is ready to be seriously taught....
<br>
<p>I'm certainly not retracting the essay -- the thoughts in the &quot;Thoughts on
<br>
AI  Morality&quot; essay are all things I still agree with perfectly well (though
<br>
I might place different emphases today), but they do not reflect my complete
<br>
opinions and thoughts on the topic.  The discussions on this list have
<br>
brought out other opinions I have on the topic, that I did not put in that
<br>
essay.
<br>
<p>Now you cite some quotes from me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;It does not seem at all strange to me to partially rely on the advice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  an appropriate group of others, when making an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision. It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  unwise to me *not* to.&quot; - Ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;c) whomever creates an AGI, intrinsically has enough wisdom that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be trusted to personally decide the future of the human race&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben claiming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  this is what Eliezer believes (and implicitly what Ben does not believe?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not seem to match up with the sentiment here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;But intuitively, I feel that an AGI with these values is going to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  positive force in the universe – where by “positive” I mean “in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with Ben Goertzel’s value system”.&quot; - Ben's idea of how an AI figures out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  what's &quot;right&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't see the mismatch here, Brian.
<br>
<p>In truth,
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
I do feel it's likely that an AGI with the values I described in my paper,
<br>
would probably be a positive force in the universe according to my own value
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
And, I feel that the decision of whether to halt or proceed with an AI
<br>
project, once it gets to an advanced phase, is too big for just me to make;
<br>
I would certainly want to consult others whose opinion I respected at that
<br>
phase.
<br>
<p>What's the inconsistency?  That I did not say 2) in the essay you're
<br>
referring to?  It was just a quick essay, not a systematic manifesto.   You
<br>
cannot rightly assume that I disagree with all things that are NOT said in
<br>
that essay...
<br>
<p>Certainly, these discussions with Eli, you, James Higgins and others are
<br>
stimulating and productive, and will have an effect on what I finally say
<br>
when I do write that &quot;Novamente Friendly AI Manifesto&quot;, when I feel the time
<br>
is right...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another interesting quote from Ben's AI Morality paper to give us all a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warm fuzzy feeling:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What happens when the system revises itself over and over again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  its intelligence until we can no longer control or understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it?  Will it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  retain the values it has begun with?  Realistically, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody’s guess!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  My own guess is that the Easy values are more likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retained through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successive drastic self-modifications – but the Hard values do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a prayer of survival, if they’re embedded in a robust value dual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; network with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate basic values at the top.  Only time will tell.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>And that, Brian, is the straight truth as I see it.
<br>
<p>Realistically, we don't know how any Friendliness approach is going to work
<br>
out in any given AGI system, until we have
<br>
<p>1) built and experimented with the AGI system, or
<br>
<p>2) created a really solid mathematical model of the AGI system and its
<br>
behavior in real-world conditions
<br>
<p>Now, modern math seems not to be up to 2), so barring an immense
<br>
breakthrough in that regard, that leaves us with 1).
<br>
<p>About how Eli's Friendliness architecture will work out in his (yet to be
<br>
defined in detail) AGI system, I'd also say: Only time will tell.  His
<br>
somewhat plausible logical arguments are very far from a mathematical proof
<br>
that his Friendliness architecture will work in his AGI system.  In
<br>
particular, I am not the only one to ask him &quot;Why do you think the Friendly
<br>
goal system will really be stable under self-modifications?&quot; and not get an
<br>
answer that seems satisfactory....  If he had
<br>
<p>1) built and experimented with his AGI system, or
<br>
<p>2) created a solid math. theory of his AGI system and its Friendliness
<br>
<p>then he could answer this question in a way nearly any reasonable person
<br>
would accept.  Lacking either 1) or 2), it's all speculative conjecture....
<br>
Like it or lump it!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;From my quick read his FAI ideas boil down to hardcoding part of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality into his AI, and training it to know about the rest, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning it loose hoping it somehow sticks to it.
</em><br>
<p>My initial approach will indeed be to hardcode part of my morality into my
<br>
AI, and train it to know about the rest, and see what happens -- while the
<br>
AI is at a profoundly infrahuman, Novababy stage....  A lot of different
<br>
configurations will be experimented with, maybe even a CFAI-style
<br>
hierarchical goal system....  This will be a learning phase.  During this
<br>
phase, some simple protections will be built in to protect against the
<br>
extremely unlikely event of an unexpected hard takeoff -- but I feel the
<br>
correct design of these protections will only be determinable via
<br>
experimentation during this same phase.
<br>
<p>About my plan being &quot;turning it loose hoping it somehow sticks to it&quot;,
<br>
that's not quite right.  I think I've clarified that in this e-mail.  Of
<br>
course, if the AGI seems to be moving in a bad direction, it should be
<br>
halted; and though I didn't say so in the essay, of course I intend to
<br>
involve others than myself in this decision.
<br>
<p>You may feel it is irresponsible to proceed with AGI development without
<br>
having systematically written down my approach to AI morality.  To restate
<br>
my view yet again, however, I feel that AI morality should be approached
<br>
largely as an empirical science, and that attempts to make grandiose and
<br>
definitive statements or theories about it prior to actually having an AGI
<br>
to play with, are going to be largely a waste of time.
<br>
<p>I feel the same way about theories of computer consciousness for example.
<br>
There are loads and loads of papers by academics on computer consciousness.
<br>
The *real* study of computer consciousness, however, is going to start when
<br>
we have AGI's that display consciousness-like behaviors to play with!  AT
<br>
that point, all the writings on computer consciousness from the previous
<br>
period, are going to seem kind of silly...
<br>
<p><p>So far, based on these disussions, when i rewrite the &quot;AI Morality&quot; essay I
<br>
will add in the following points, with elaborated explanations:
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
AI morality and AI consciousness are only going to become scientific when
<br>
they are pursued as *experimental science*, and we're just not there yet...
<br>
until then it's just entertaining, thought-stimulating conjecture...
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
It's important to put in protections against unexpected hard takeoff, but
<br>
the effective design of these protections is hard, and the right way to do
<br>
it will only be determined thru experimentation with actual AGI systems
<br>
(again, experimental science)
<br>
<p>3)
<br>
Yes, it is a tough decision to decide when an AGI should be allowed to
<br>
increase its intelligence unprotectedly.  A group of Singularity wizards
<br>
should be consulted, it shouldn't be left up to one guy.
<br>
<p>MAYBE I will also replace the references to my own personal morality with
<br>
references to some kind of generic &quot;transhumanist morality.&quot;  However, that
<br>
would take a little research into what articulations of transhumanist
<br>
morality already exist.  I know the Extropian stuff, but for my taste, that
<br>
generally emphasizes the virtue of compassion far too little....
<br>
<p>What I will not do in any revision of the essay -- except one written after
<br>
significant experimentation with a Novababy has been done -- is introduce
<br>
any definitive statement that one or another particular approach to ensuring
<br>
Friendliness, or measuring intelligence increase, is likely to be effective.
<br>
I feel there is just too much uncertainty in these regards, at this stage.
<br>
<p>Are there any other significant issues that you think should be addressed in
<br>
the revision, Brian?  Knowing what you know now about my overall point of
<br>
view on these matters?
