<p>&nbsp;Killing people for what seem like good reasons might tend

to corrupt a human, but to the best my knowledge, I can't see it affecting a
<br>
<p>Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>### The AI will have a very complex network of hierarchical goals, as well
<br>
as Bayesian priors, being adjusted to function in a complex environment with
<br>
uncertain information. Don't you think that there might be a pervasive
<br>
change, an accumulation of small biases towards violent solutions? Whenever
<br>
the AI has to make a decision using uncertain data, the verification of the
<br>
validity of the decision might take a long time, and might be affected by
<br>
the current state of the AI. Once in a state predisposing to violent
<br>
behaviors, self-reinforcing patterns could emerge, with violence leading to
<br>
violent responses, and the (perceived) need for more violent responses,
<br>
especially if there are multiple AI's involved. Friendliness is difficult if
<br>
there is no possiblity of verifying the motives and actions of game
<br>
participants, and this would be the case with warring AI's. Their
<br>
motivations would be opaque to each other, therefore subject to the same
<br>
type of social dynamics that occurs in humans incapable of monitoring each
<br>
other's behavior (first strikes, arms races, etc.) The FAI might learn the
<br>
meaning of being Friendly to humans but I think it would have difficulty
<br>
with learning to be friendly to the combination of tribal humans with their
<br>
own tribal-Friendly AI's. As you later say, the growing up of the infant AI
<br>
might be unfavorably affected, in the distant analogy to the detrimental
<br>
effects of early childhood emotional trauma in humans.
