<p>
hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As already stated on this list several times, we intend to give Novababy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; read but not write access to the Internet, at first, until a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has been done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please describe how this works.. as I'm not sure you know, simply sending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a request to a vulnerable web server formatted in the proper way will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in the potential for a virus or whatever to be implanted.
</em><br>
<p>I do not have time at the moment to go into details on technical stuff like
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>There probably is no way to absolutely create an &quot;anti-firewall&quot;, absolutely
<br>
preventing a system from ever doing any small damage.
<br>
<p>However, by intelligently restricting the grammar of outgoing requests, one
<br>
can go very far in this direction.
<br>
<p>The Net is a tremendous information resource for a growing AGI baby....  Not
<br>
using it at all, is simply not an option.
<br>
<p>One option we've considered is to create a huge mirror of a large portion of
<br>
the Net, for the system's use.  However, this would cost mucho dinero!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why not just agree, here and now, to have it ready 6 months before?
</em><br>
<p>Ummm -- because &quot;6 months&quot; is an arbitrary figure set by you because it is
<br>
half the period of the Earth's rotation around the sun?
<br>
<p>I am going to use my own common sense here.  I will release this
<br>
documentation a reasonable period before we have a complete system ready to
<br>
roll, for you and other interested parties to comment on.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, since nowadays you are talking about having some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; committee make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the final decision,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Actually, as I said very many times on this list, what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought was a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea was an *expert advisory board*, intimately involved with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when it reaches near-takeoff stage.  This does not imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the advisory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; board has final decision making power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not give them the power if you truly believe they have a higher level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of combined wisdom than yourself?
</em><br>
<p>Because a lot of things can go wrong with a committee, as Eliezer has
<br>
pointed out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; if they come back to you and say &quot;The .01%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; chance we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; calculated that your AI will go rogue at some point in the far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; future is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; much in our opinion. Pull the plug.&quot; you will pull the plug?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In that exact case, Brian, it would be a hard decision.  A .01%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI going rogue at sometime in the far future is pretty damn small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What I'd really like the experts for is to help arrive at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .01% figure in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the first place, actually...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So at this point, you can't answer my question? I guess it is one of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things best left to the heat of the moment :-)
</em><br>
<p>What would your answer be, if the same question were aimed at you regarding
<br>
your own Ai project?
<br>
<p>And once you tell me your answer, why should I believe you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A consensus among a large committee of individualists is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausibly going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be achieved on *any* nontrivial issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if they did?
</em><br>
<p>If a diverse committee of transhumanist-minded individuals agreed that going
<br>
ahead with a Novamente-lauchned singularity was a very bad idea, then, I
<br>
would not do it.
<br>
<p>[Unless there was some weird extenuating circumstance, like all the
<br>
committee members being brainwashed, or paid off, etc.]
<br>
<p>However, this is not the same as your last question.  Because a diverse
<br>
committee of transhumanist-minded individuals would be incredibly unlikely
<br>
to say &quot;The .01% chance we have calculated that your AI will go rogue at
<br>
some point in the far future is too much in our opinion. Pull the plug.&quot;
<br>
This statement bespeaks a lack of appreciation of the possibility that the
<br>
human race will destroy itself *on any given day* via nuclear or biological
<br>
warfare, etc.  It is not at all the kind of statement one would expect from
<br>
a set of Singularity wizards, now is it?
<br>
<p>I honestly do not believe we're *ever* going to be able to reduce &quot;the
<br>
probability that an AI goes rogue at some point in the far future&quot; to less
<br>
than .01%, with any meaningful degree of confidence.  This kind of certainty
<br>
is not going to be available pre-Singularity.
<br>
