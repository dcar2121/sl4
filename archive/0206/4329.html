</em><br>

<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; [others have gotten this impression from you as well; I recently received
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a personal e-mail in which someone else referred to (his wording) your
</em><br>
<em> &gt; idea that you are &quot;The One&quot;]
</em><br>
<p>Suppose I did think that I was uniquely suited to playing a key role in the
<br>
Singularity.  It wouldn't necessarily make me confident of my ideas.
<br>
Humility should not be confused with modesty.  Humility is a way to conduct
<br>
yourself in an interaction with Nature; modesty is a way to conduct yourself
<br>
in an interaction with others.  I believe in humility but not modesty. 
<br>
Humility is a form of rationality.  Modesty is not.  And how bright you 
<br>
think you are, and how far you think your ideas have gotten at any given 
<br>
point, are rationally unrelated, regardless of whether they may be linked 
<br>
emotionally by the factory settings of the human mind.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, for my actual views on this topic, see:
<br>
<a href="http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/0204/0118.html">http://sysopmind.com/archive-sl4/0204/0118.html</a>
<br>
<p><em> &gt; b) your approach to Friendly AI is the right way to ensure the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Singularity comes out well
</em><br>
<p>Again:  There is a difference between having gotten far enough to know that
<br>
a given proposal isn't enough, and believing that your own proposal will 
<br>
work.  As for the Friendly AI part of it, I think that again I may have 
<br>
failed to convey the question to which Friendly AI is an answer.  It's not 
<br>
about getting an AI to do something for you or instilling an AI with a vague 
<br>
feeling of helpfulness toward humans; if that were the case there might, 
<br>
indeed, be many different right ways.  The question to which Friendly AI is 
<br>
intended as an answer is &quot;With the future of all humanity at stake, how do 
<br>
you construct a self-improving mind so as to enter the best possible 
<br>
Singularity?&quot;  We only get one Singularity and it has to be the best 
<br>
Singularity possible; not almost the best, but the best.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I still think you're confusing &quot;You are wrong&quot; with &quot;I am right&quot;. 
<br>
Friendly AI programmers saying &quot;I am right&quot; is worrisome.  Friendly AI 
<br>
programmers having to repeat &quot;You are wrong&quot; over and over again until holes 
<br>
are worn through their tongues is only to be expected.
<br>
<p>The strongest statement I would make about Friendly AI is &quot;I've been looking 
<br>
at this section of floor for two years, I have my trap detectors shoved out 
<br>
to absolute maximum, and I still haven't detected any basic flaws, so at 
<br>
this point, even taking into account how much is at stake, I'm ready to put 
<br>
one foot down and start shifting my weight over.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is not incompatible with plenty of repetitions of:
<br>
<p>&quot;Argh!  Wait!  Don't go there!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Hmph.  What makes you such a better trap detector than I am?  You think you 
<br>
know the one true path through this labyrinth?  Maybe my path is better, did 
<br>
you ever think of that?  Jeez, I never met anyone as arrogant as you.  What 
<br>
makes you so confident that YOUR route is safe?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Look, I'm not trying to shove in on your territory, but could you humor me 
<br>
and just take one step to the right?  To the RIGHT.  No, that's - shoot.&quot;
