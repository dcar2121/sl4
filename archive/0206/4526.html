<p>
<em>&gt; The *entire point* of Friendly AI is to eliminate dependency on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers' morals.  You can argue that this is impossible or that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture laid out in CFAI will not achieve this purpose, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not represent me as in any way wishing to construct an AI that uses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's morals.  I consider this absolute anathema.  The creators of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed AI should not occupy any privileged position with respect to its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.  Implementing the Singularity is a duty which confers no moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privileges upon those who undertake it.  The programmers should find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves in exactly the same position as the rest of humanity.
</em><br>
<p>This strikes me as phenomenally unrealistic, Eliezer.
<br>
<p>The vast majority of the Earth's population consists of deeply religious
<br>
people.  A decent percentage of these people think that a truly autonomous
<br>
AGI is an abomination against their god!
<br>
<p>I have respect for the beauty of the world's religious belief systems, and
<br>
for the art, poetry, music, and exalted human personalities they have helped
<br>
produce.  But I still think these belief systems are profoundly &quot;wrong&quot; in
<br>
many ways.
<br>
<p>And I don't think it's reasonable to expect that transhumanists and
<br>
traditionalist Muslims are going to be in exactly the same position with
<br>
regard to a Singularity-approaching AGI.  This just isn't plausible.  A lot
<br>
of traditionalist Muslims and other religious folks are going to think the
<br>
AGI and Singularity are bad ideas because they are not in the future history
<br>
their religion has foretold.
<br>
<p>It *may* be possible to define a kind of generic &quot;transhumanist ethics&quot;, and
<br>
ensure that one's AGI is imbued with generic transhumanist ethics rather
<br>
than with with the quirks of a programmer's individual ethics.
<br>
<p>But I am not sure how easy it will be to define a generic transhumanist
<br>
ethics, either.  For instance, we have seen that among the different
<br>
transhumanists on this list, there are very different attitudes toward
<br>
warfare.  My strong preference is to have the AGI believe killing is wrong
<br>
in almost all circumstances.  Evidently some transhumanists disagree.
<br>
Should I then refrain from teaching the AGI that killing is wrong in almost
<br>
all circumstances, because by doing so, I am teaching it Ben Goertzel ethics
<br>
instead of genetic transhumanist ethics?
<br>
<p>I am not sure it's possible to teach a system ethics as a set of abstract
<br>
principles, only.  Maybe  most of the teaching has to be teaching by
<br>
example.  And if it is teaching by example, there's going to be a fair bit
<br>
of individual bias in the selection of examples....
