<em>&gt; Of course you realize that the trend in growth of past estimates done by

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I find myself agreeing with Eugene on this score.  Many of the computational 
<br>
models on which estimates of the &quot;maximum hardware power&quot; of the human brain 
<br>
are based seem absurdly simple by comparison with any modern paper on 
<br>
computing in actual human neurons.  At the same time, the notion that all 
<br>
that potential power is being used effectively - that all systems intrinsic 
<br>
artifacts contribute materially to computation at higher levels of 
<br>
organization, such that it would require a perfect simulation of that 
<br>
systems artifact to obtain that contribution through any other means - is 
<br>
equally absurd.  I would place the estimate of computing power needed for a 
<br>
blindly faithful upload as being at least on the order of 10^19 ops/sec or 
<br>
10^21 ops/sec.  For AI, on the other hand, the number of major differences 
<br>
at all levels of organization is enough to shatter the analogy.  I'm not 
<br>
sure that there exists anything to be gained from the mapping any more.  But 
<br>
I do agree with Eugene that existing estimates of supposed &quot;maximums&quot; are 
<br>
not taking into account anything like the complexity of computing in single 
<br>
neurons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Therefore, I estimate, that the $1000 desk top of 2002 is not more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;than three doublings away from human level complex problem solving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;general deliberative software implementation capability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're still confusing crunch (measured in what? remember memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwidth) with a generally intelligent system.  You'll observe that a kg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of neuron suspension in liquid culture is usually not very intelligent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if we assume you're not wildly overoptimistic, you're completely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignoring the bootstrap issue. It may require a lot of crunch to be able to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do neat stuff with a modest amount of crunch.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how Mike Deering gets from his statements to the above estimate. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems like a non sequitur.
