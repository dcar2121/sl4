'Thinking' robot in escape bid
<br>
By Dave Higgens
<br>
London
<br>
June 20 2002
<br>
<p>Scientists running a pioneering experiment with
<br>
&quot;living robots&quot; which think for themselves today said
<br>
they were amazed to find one escaping from the centre
<br>
where it &quot;lives&quot;.
<br>
<p>The small unit, called Gaak, was one of 12 taking part
<br>
in a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; test at the Magna
<br>
science centre in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, which
<br>
has been running since March.
<br>
<p>Gaak made its bid for freedom yesterday after it had
<br>
been taken out of the arena where hundreds of visitors
<br>
watch the machines learning as they do daily battle
<br>
for minor repairs. 
<br>
<p>Professor Noel Sharkey said he turned his back on the
<br>
drone and returned 15 minutes later to find it had
<br>
forced its way out of the small make-shift paddock it
<br>
was being kept in.
<br>
<p>He later found it had travelled down an access slope,
<br>
through the front door of the centre and was
<br>
eventually discovered at the main entrance to the car
<br>
park when a visitor nearly flattened it with his car. 
<br>
<p>Sharkey said: &quot;Since the experiment went live in March
<br>
they have all learned a significant amount and are
<br>
becoming more intelligent by the day but the fact that
<br>
it had ability to navigate itself out of the building
<br>
and along the concrete floor to the gates has
<br>
surprised us all.&quot;
<br>
<p>And he added: &quot;But there's no need to worry, as
<br>
although they can escape they are perfectly harmless
<br>
and won't be taking over just yet.&quot;
<br>
<p>Motorist Dan Lowthorpe, 27, from Sheffield, who nearly
<br>
prematurely terminated Gaak said: &quot;I have visited
<br>
Magna a couple of times in the past but came on this
<br>
occasion especially to see the new robots. 
<br>
<p>&quot;You can imagine how surprised I was when I nearly ran
<br>
over one on my way in. I knew the robots interacted
<br>
with each but didn't expect to be personally greeted
<br>
by one.&quot;
