My my, I go to the theater and the list gets tons of posts.  I should go 
<br>
more often.  :-)  BTW, &quot;Nunsense&quot; is a very funny play that you should 
<br>
go see if you have a chance.  With great actors and a bit of 
<br>
improvisation, it's so funny even a rabid atheist or a `lowly' 
<br>
Protestant (remember, the title is *Nun*sense) will be laughing.

<p>Well, you don't *have* to be a Zen master, but it does help.  This

example comes from personal experience, because at one time this is the

kind of thing I would have done.  I've moved beyond that and it simply

doesn't happen anymore.  If that makes me a Zen master, thank you for

the compliment.  ;-)

<p>I've been thinking, when I give examples, this is the biggest hurdle I

have to get around.  It's not enough to say &quot;here's an example of 
<br>
someone thinking rationally&quot;, I have to say &quot;here's an example of 
<br>
someone thinking rationally, and here's why it's rational and why it

would be irrational given these situations&quot;.  I hope that would get 
<br>
across the point that it's not the behavior but the motivation that

makes an action rational.

<p><em>&gt; I have found that, despite all common wisdom, the most critical part of

<p>While I see your point of view, many of us are not that creative yet, so 
<br>
we are forced to resort to more brute force measures when we're outside 
<br>
of our domain of great creativity.  Personally, I'm only so creative 
<br>
that I don't have to rely on brainstorming in the realm of Tetris, but 
<br>
only because I've played the game for thousands of hours and become a 
<br>
master.  Step away from Tetris and I'm just like everyone else, where 
<br>
being creative means thinking up some good ideas, some not so good 
<br>
ideas, and learning how to pick out the good ideas and make them better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Real rationality is very, very rare.

<p>Well, re the Zen Master comment, I guess you found some.  :-P  (I kid; I 
<br>
still have a bit of irrationality to work out.)
