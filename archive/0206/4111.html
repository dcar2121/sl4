<p>Max, I am fully aware of this, which is why I cited the Foresight Institute 
<br>
and Neural Signals, Inc., neither of which I am personally involved with, as 
<br>
well as the work of researchers who Kurzweil specifically mentioned as 
<br>
important at the Foresight Gathering.  (Perhaps I should have mentioned the 
<br>
Extropy Institute as well.)  This is not about the merits of any one course 
<br>
of research, but a question of how we are to fulfill those moral obligations 
<br>
that devolve upon us when we become aware of the Singularity.  I think that 
<br>
first we have to resolve the moral issue of &quot;Can we speed up the 
<br>
Singularity?  Do we have a moral obligation to try?&quot; before considering the 
<br>
pros and cons of particular approaches.  This is why I did my best to 
<br>
mention a broad spectrum of paths to the Singularity in my reply to 
<br>
Kurzweil, concentrating specifically on those research directions 
<br>
(brain-computer interfaces, integrative computational neurology) that 
<br>
Kurzweil has singled out as important.
<br>
<p>If Kurzweil chooses to become an activist on behalf of *any* technology that 
<br>
he believes is the most critical, the most neglected link on the path to 
<br>
Singularity, I will applaud the ethics and responsibility of that moral 
<br>
decision *before* raising any issues with his choice of technology.  If 
<br>
Kurzweil decides to throw his full efforts behind implementing the 
<br>
Singularity, others will follow in his footsteps, with different choices of 
<br>
key technology, and whatever real critical links exist will be funded 
<br>
eventually.  What I fear is a world in which people hear about the 
<br>
Singularity and use it to rationalize whatever they were already doing. 
<br>
What I fear is a world in which Kurzweil, as the first presenter of the 
<br>
Singularity meme, inadvertantly inoculates his audience with the idea that 
<br>
we can derive comfort from the Singularity concept without *doing* anything 
<br>
to achieve the actual Singularity.  If this happens, spreading the word 
<br>
about the Singularity will do nothing to achieve the humanistic goal that is 
<br>
the Singularity itself, and the people who insist that the Singularity is a 
<br>
religion will be right.
