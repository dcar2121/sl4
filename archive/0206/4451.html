<p>So creating an organization to promote the inclusion of Friendliness into

</em><br>
<em>&gt;could have &quot;solved&quot; this problem by creating a committee to decide on AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality, which would have a greater appearance of authority and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trustworthiness.  But you cannot solve Singularity problems like that. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Political problems, yes; Singularity problems, no.
</em><br>
<p>God damn it.  Do you speak English?  Do you actually READ what I type?  How 
<br>
many times do I have to say that NO ONE want's to turn the problem over to 
<br>
committee!  As Ben put it this would be an advisory board.  What's, your 
<br>
telling us neither yourself nor anyone working on such things could even 
<br>
benefit from advice from your peers?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My interest is *not* in convincing people that solutions will work.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want a solution that *does work*.  I suppose, as a secondary goal, that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want people to know the truth, but that is not primary; solving the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem is primary.  It is not supposed to be persuasive, it is supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to ACTUALLY WORK.  Lose sight of that and game over.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but have you actually considered the idea that you could be 
<br>
wrong?  That YOUR ideas may not work?  Have you considered what would 
<br>
happen if this were the case?  As they say, two heads are better than one 
<br>
(which, btw, I very much agree with).  So having a few different people all 
<br>
working on the Friendliness problem would be highly beneficial.  If for no 
<br>
other reason than it would give all of them alternate ideas to look at and 
<br>
think about, which may then improve their own designs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I know a *lot* of AI morality concepts that sound appealing but are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;utterly unworkable.  For that reason, above all else, I am scared to death 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of committees.  It seems very predictable what the result will be and it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be absolutely deadly.
</em><br>
<p>Would you please get off the committee thing.  Your sounding like a broken 
<br>
record because you just keep repeating the same point, over and 
<br>
over.  Advisory board, not committee (I should NEVER have called it such - 
<br>
my bad).  Everyone can always use some good advice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;That said:  This is a fucking stupid suicidal idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Well, alrighty then.  Could you please clarify your point a bit?  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;sounds like your reacting in a completely irrational manor, heavily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;influenced by emotions.  I don't see anything suicidal about promoting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Friendliness in regard to the Singularity or trying to ensure that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Singularity is attempted in a reasonable and safe manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A Friendly AI designed by a committee?  Why aren't more people panicking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over this?  It sounds like the backstory of Ed Merta's &quot;Worst-Case Scenario&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Because everyone else has READ what we've posted and get the point that NO 
<br>
ONE endorses the idea of having a committee design any AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And no, I will not design a Friendly AI to please a committee either.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will not design a Friendly AI for any purpose other than being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendly.  IF such a committee exists I will attempt to convince it that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;its first duty is to disband.  It is inherently difficult to convince a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;committee of this, *regardless of whether it is true*, which in itself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shows that a committee is a bad idea.  Committees don't know what they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't know.
</em><br>
<p>Its seems to be inherently difficult to convince you that your not god and 
<br>
shouldn't personally be making all the decisions that will permanently seal 
<br>
the fate of the human race.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Here's an idea:  Instead of convening the Committee to Fuck Up Friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI, let's convene the Committee to Decide Whether the CFUFAI Should Exist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the First Place, with a clear understanding that the members of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CDWCSEFP will probably *not* serve on CFUFAI.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Look at the mess we have right here on SL4!  You can't agree over whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CFUFAI should be a purely advisory organization, a small transhumanist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organization with real powers (enforced how?), or a government committee; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can't agree whether or not military AI development is inherently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frightening...
</em><br>
<p>Your not reading again.  I've never said I wanted it to be a government 
<br>
committee and, in fact, have strongly stated the opposite.  And, I'm sorry, 
<br>
could you please give me a reference to ANY of my SL4 posts where I say 
<br>
that military AI development would not be frightening?  I'm not stupid 
<br>
Eliezer.  Either of those would be a horrible, horrible thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The natural situation is probably as good as we're going to get.  Random 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people fighting over who gets to give orders to AI projects will simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make things much, much worse.  If you want to influence the Singularity, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do the moral thing and devote your entire life to doing nothing else, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thereby gaining some
</em><br>
<p>Random people?  You really don't listen.
