<em>&gt;  &gt; And so is the seeking, grasping nature of the whole AGI pursuit.  Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; is about being contented with what is, not about constantly striving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to create a whole new order.  It teaches compassion, but simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; compassion in each moment, not compassion via building thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; machines to change the world. If the Zen Buddhist in me were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; dominant, I wouldn't be working on AGI, I'd be sitting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; meditating, walking thru the woods, and helping the needy directly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would you change your nature so?  Can you not be content with what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are?
</em><br>
<p>It would seem not.  I flunked out of Zen and took up transhumanism instead
<br>
;)
<br>
[A joke -- of course the two are not contradictory]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; This asks a lot more.  Atheism is not anthropomorphic or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; human-culture-bound so an AI can naturally be expected to happen upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; it as a possible attitude. Catholicism is highly anthropomorphic, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; it would take a lot of work to make a nonhuman system have spiritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; experiences consistent with the &quot;father son and holy ghost&quot; meme,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are making this statement from the viewpoint that Catholicism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong and that an impartial mind would have to be *forced* into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreement with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A Catholic would have a very different perspective on what was needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for an objective observer to come to the correct conclusion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Catholicism is the true religion.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps so.  I don't know any religious Catholics who would be willing to
<br>
enter into this sort of discussion.
<br>
<p>If you do, and have the discussion, please let me know the results!
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; If our universe had been created by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Trinity were bound up in the foundations of order for all reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and our own world simply a reflection of it, then Novamente would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed, as it grew and came to reflect more and more of the universe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn more and more of its creators, find these concepts quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'natural'.  For Novamente too exists in the world that is sustained by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bounty of the Lord.  Do not suppose in your hubris that Novamente
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists independently of God because you have 'created' it, for the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materials of which you fashioned it exist by the will of the Creator and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would cease in an instant if ever He should withdraw His will.  Amen.
</em><br>
<p>And if Novamente *failed* to see the truth of the {Father, Son, Holy Spirit}
<br>
story, what would this prove, to our hypothetical Catholic
<br>
<p>A) that the story is wrong?
<br>
<p>B) that Novamente is demon-spawn???
