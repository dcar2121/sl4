<p>Hi John, here's a few quick points/questions. Even if we take as given that
<br>
some slightly-post-Singularity societies make the decision (and adhere to
<br>
it down to each and every single individual) not to immediately seed the
<br>
Universe with probes to find and uplift any and all semi-intelligent
<br>
life that wants it, that still leaves some &quot;holes&quot;:
<br>
<p>1. Shouldn't such societies (who are theoretically doing this in order to
<br>
preserve all the &quot;experiments&quot; running out there) still seed the Universe
<br>
with hidden probes to seek out life near transcension, and intervene in
<br>
the end if a blight or other life-destroying phenomenon is about to occur?
<br>
The only reason not to do this is if you take the true Darwinian approach
<br>
and prefer to let failed experiments fail all the way to the end even once
<br>
you can see how it is going to play out. That sounds too harsh to be
<br>
believable...
<br>
<p>2. Shouldn't such societies also seed the Universe with probes to prevent
<br>
any other societies from attempting colonization? If you want to preserve
<br>
the most amount of Universe real estate in its natural state to allow stuff
<br>
to evolve there then you may have to expend efforts to protect it from other
<br>
post-Singularity societies that don't hold your views. Or would this kind
<br>
of intervention be messing with the evolution of the Universe also?
<br>
<p>3. Which brings me to point out that doesn't your theory itself predict
<br>
post-Singularity societies, since they have been left to themselves, will
<br>
end up potentially filling differing &quot;end states&quot;? Unless all of these end
<br>
states wind up leading the societies that value the Communication-Censored
<br>
approach, then we are missing something... and if they all DO converge on
<br>
the C-C approach, what's the real point of letting them suffer through
<br>
their adolescence alone when we only end up with cookie cutter end states?
<br>
<p>P.S. I don't buy the idea that any society deciding to seed the Universe
<br>
with probes is limited to only sending some kind of fixed primer. The
<br>
probes could contain vastly more than that, perhaps copies of chunks of
<br>
whole post-Singularity societies kept in stasis (or not) that have made
<br>
a decision to not transcend past the point of missing out on watching a
<br>
part of real space.
