<p><em>&gt; Whether a goal is short term or long is not the determining factor of

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's how we've come to view the situation in terms of
<br>
the meanings we give the terms, or so it seems to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the term length or effort is not the determining factors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precedence [rather] the value of the goal is.  [Yes]

<em>&gt; &gt; I'm very skeptical that it is even possible, let alone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wise, to *always* resist short term temptation. (Strange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that evolution never stumbled on endowing some creature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with only long term goals.)
</em><br>
<p>Mikko corrected that with
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not that strange, since thinking in terms of long term goals requires a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparatively sophisticated mind, and that's hard enough to evolve as it is.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, although 200,000 years does seem a long time for long-term
<br>
goals not to have precluded short term motivations in humans, but
<br>
you could very well be right.
<br>
<p>Gordon writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's an over-emphasis here on short term goals and long term goals.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a matter of evaluating what will happen in the future as a result 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an action and determining which tradeoff is better.
</em><br>
<p>Seems abundantly well put to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this example, the short term tradeoff is either that I get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the girl and take an easy class or I learn something interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and take the hard class.  Long term, I have a very low chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of gaining a life long friend or a high chance of learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something which will be useful.
</em><br>
<p>I think I understand; but implicitly here there are 3 goals:  getting
<br>
the girl (and your system's incentive to reproduce?), learning something
<br>
interesting, gaining a friend.  It sounds like 2 and 3 are long term,
<br>
and in your value system it also appears, for some reason, &quot;rational&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, it's not ignoring all short term goals, but those goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that result from human biases.  For example, I have two books laying on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my desk.  One is a collection of short stories by PKD and the other is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on system software (the programs that make computers go).  How I decide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which to read will be based on a large number of factors, but none of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them relate to my ability to reproduce (even if improved reproductive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fitness results, I give it a weighting of zero).
</em><br>
<p>The only way that I can parse this last sentence &quot;ability to
<br>
reproduce&quot; is by conflating it with my conjecture above that
<br>
you meant by &quot;getting the girl&quot; a satisfaction of your 
<br>
instincts to biologically reproduce.
<br>
<p>I suspect that you and others here have adequately answered the
<br>
following questions, but I could still use some help:  what makes
<br>
some of those goals rational and not others?  You clearly identify
<br>
with the long-term institution Gordon Worley, and not with the
<br>
subsystems that you almost never give in to (by your previous claims).
<br>
I'm real murky on how rationality fits into all this.
<br>
<p>(I will post an appreciation of Ben's characterizations of
<br>
&quot;rationality&quot; soon.)
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
