</em><br>
<p>Name EVEN ONE method.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; No such leverage is available for later stages. This is our window of

</em><br>
<em> &gt; limitations.
</em><br>
<p>How?  I've been asking you this for the last few years and have yet to
<br>
receive a straight answer.  Pardon me; I got a straight answer over IRC
<br>
once, which you later disclaimed as soon as I mentioned it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; Singularity; the Singularity doesn't come in a &quot;soft&quot; version that lets
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; you go on a few dates before deciding on a commitment.  That option
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; might be open to individual humans (or not), but it is not a real
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; option for humanity.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; You're arguing that you can influence the onset, but not the general
</em><br>
<em> &gt; shape of the Singularity. I have to disagree on the latter, since the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; foothills (defined by presence of basically unmodified people) can be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; obviously engineered.
</em><br>
<p>How?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; I would call it dead certain in favor of a hard takeoff, unless all the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;  intelligences at the core of that hard takeoff unanimously decide
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; otherwise.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Wonders have been known to happen.
</em><br>
<p>What concrete reason do you have for expecting a &quot;wonder&quot; in this case?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; All economic, computational, and, as far as I can tell, moral
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; indicators
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; My moral indicator might be broken, but I don't see how activities
</em><br>
<em> &gt; involving a very real probablity of complete extinction of all biological
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  life on this planet can be called moral.
</em><br>
<p>I guess that makes &quot;human intelligence&quot; immoral, then, because I don't know
<br>
of any path into the future that involves zero existential risk.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; fall through to much faster substrate than our 200Hz neurons.  The
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; closest we might come to a slow Singularity is if the first transhumans
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; are pure biological humans, in which case it might take a few years for
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; them to build AI, brain-computer interfaces, or computer-mediated
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; broadband telepathy with 64-node clustered humans, but my guess is that
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; the first transhumans would head for more powerful Singularity
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; technologies straight out of the gate.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I should hope not. It would seem to be much more ethical to offer
</em><br>
<em> &gt; assistance to those yet unmodified to get onboard, while you're still
</em><br>
<em> &gt; encrusted with the nicer human artifacts and the player delta has not yet
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  grown sufficiently large that empathy gets eroded into indifference.
</em><br>
<p>You know, maybe I shouldn't mention this, since you'll probably choose to
<br>
respond to it instead of my repeated questions for any concrete way of
<br>
producing a soft Singularity; but if you believe that all altruism is
<br>
irrational, why do you claim to be currently altruistic?  Do you see
<br>
yourself as having chosen altruism &quot;over&quot; rationality as the result of your
<br>
&quot;legacy&quot; empathy?  I can't see trusting someone who sees the inside of their
<br>
mind that way.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; We don't have to shovel the inhibition agent by the ton all the time.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Later stages can't and shouldn't be controlled.
</em><br>
<p>You have yet to give even a single reason why we should think earlier stages
<br>
are controllable.  What is an &quot;inhibition agent&quot; and how does it differ from
<br>
magical fairy dust?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; very little point in trying.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Once again we disagree. There's tremendous point in trying if human lifes
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  are at stake.
</em><br>
<p>They are at stake.  The slower the Singularity, the more die in the
<br>
meanwhile; and all known proposals for attempting to deliberately slow the 
<br>
Singularity increase total existential risk.  (I'm not talking about your 
<br>
proposals, since you have to yet to make any, but rather the proposals of 
<br>
Bill Joy and the like.)
