<p>I disagree. There's a qualitative difference if changes ordinarily

occuring during a decade are happening within a second. We can handle a
<br>
lot of change during a decade. Lumping that change in a single second
<br>
completely overloads our capability to adapt. Considerable leverage is
<br>
available to people to inhibit the kinetics of early stages via legacy
<br>
methods.
<br>
<p>No such leverage is available for later stages. This is our window of
<br>
operation to reduce our vulnerabilities by addressing some of our key 
<br>
limitations.

<p><em>&gt; Singularity; the Singularity doesn't come in a &quot;soft&quot; version that

</em><br>
<p>You're arguing that you can influence the onset, but not the general shape 
<br>
of the Singularity. I have to disagree on the latter, since the foothills 
<br>
(defined by presence of basically unmodified people) can be obviously 
<br>
engineered.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I would call it dead certain in favor of a hard takeoff, unless all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences at the core of that hard takeoff unanimously decide otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Wonders have been known to happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   All economic, computational, and, as far as I can tell, moral indicators
</em><br>
<p>My moral indicator might be broken, but I don't see how activities
<br>
involving a very real probablity of complete extinction of all biological
<br>
life on this planet can be called moral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; point straight toward a hard takeoff.  The Singularity involves an inherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive feedback loop; smart minds produce smarter minds which produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still smarter minds and so on.  Furthermore, thought itself is likely to

<p>This assumes a) you are in the possession of a human equivalent mind b) it
<br>
profits immediately from self enhancement c) it is allowed unfettered
<br>
operation.
<br>
<p>All these points are questionable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fall through to much faster substrate than our 200Hz neurons.  The closest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we might come to a slow Singularity is if the first transhumans are pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological humans, in which case it might take a few years for them to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, brain-computer interfaces, or computer-mediated broadband telepathy with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 64-node clustered humans, but my guess is that the first transhumans would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head for more powerful Singularity technologies straight out of the gate.
</em><br>
<p>I should hope not. It would seem to be much more ethical to offer
<br>
assistance to those yet unmodified to get onboard, while you're still
<br>
encrusted with the nicer human artifacts and the player delta has not yet
<br>
grown sufficiently large that empathy gets eroded into indifference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Beyond that point it would be a hard takeoff.  I see no moral reason for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowing this down while people are dying.
</em><br>
<p>I see the reason for slowing down (that's a wrong picture, because most
<br>
things needed to speeded up, and only a couple of dangerous ones need to
<br>
be slowed down) if a hard takeoff will kill all life on this planet in a
<br>
few hours flat.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I would say that the Singularity &quot;wants&quot; to be hard; the difficulty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping it soft would increase asymptotically the farther you got, and I see
</em><br>
<p>We don't have to shovel the inhibition agent by the ton all the time. 
<br>
Later stages can't and shouldn't be controlled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; very little point in trying.
</em><br>
<p>Once again we disagree. There's tremendous point in trying if human lifes 
<br>
are at stake.
