<p><p>You have an interesting library, but it is actually a generic acronym
<br>
for The End Of The World As We Know It (TEOTWAWKI).  The acronym
<br>
predates the title of that book, which was actually called something
<br>
else in its earlier versions and only adopted the acronym in its title
<br>
much later.  I very much doubt the reference to TEOTWAWKI was a
<br>
reference to this book.
<br>
<p>(While I've never read the book, I actually know the author of it, as he
<br>
is the friend of one of my long-time friends and I've run into him on a
<br>
number of occasions. He is actually a very pleasant, laid-back, and
<br>
likable guy who doesn't really meet the profile of the kind of guy you
<br>
would think would write a book like that. The book was originally
<br>
written for other purposes and later adapted to the right-wing nutter
<br>
market as part of the publishing deal.)
