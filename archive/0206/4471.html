<em>&gt; The AI will have a very complex network of hierarchical goals, as

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sure, when the AI is young.  When the AI grows up I would expect it to rerun 
<br>
the programmers perceived considerations involved in their moral decisions, 
<br>
come to the conclusion that violent solutions were not as desirable as it 
<br>
was told (assuming the &quot;honorable soldiers&quot; are not actually correct!), 
<br>
models its own growth for biases that could have been introduced, and washes 
<br>
out the biases.  Of course a Friendly AI has to be able to do this once it 
<br>
grows up!  It's not just a military question!
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Whenever the AI has to make a decision using uncertain data,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the verification of the validity of the decision might take a long time, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and might be affected by the current state of the AI. Once in a state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predisposing to violent behaviors, self-reinforcing patterns could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerge, with violence leading to violent responses, and the (perceived) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for more violent responses, especially if there are multiple AI's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved. Friendliness is difficult if there is no possiblity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verifying the motives and actions of game participants, and this would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the case with warring AI's. Their motivations would be opaque to each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other, therefore subject to the same type of social dynamics that occurs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in humans incapable of monitoring each other's behavior (first strikes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arms races, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>That's an argument against turning control of combat over to AIs, which is a 
<br>
very different thing from an argument against exposing Friendly AIs to 
<br>
combat.   As I said before, if you want to argue against military AI there 
<br>
are plenty of other ways... it's just that I'm afraid I can't back you if 
<br>
you argue from Friendly AI theory.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The FAI might learn the meaning of being Friendly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans but I think it would have difficulty with learning to be friendly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the combination of tribal humans with their own tribal-Friendly AI's.
</em><br>
<p>No, I can't see this as any more difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As you later say, the growing up of the infant AI might be unfavorably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affected, in the distant analogy to the detrimental effects of early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; childhood emotional trauma in humans.
</em><br>
<p>This is an appealing analogy which happens to be, as best I can tell, 
<br>
completely wrong.
