<p>Granted. Though the enhancement payoff is difficult to quantify given 
<br>
current knowledge. Given current knowledge we can't even tell there's 
<br>
going to be uploads at all.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Incidentally, you have yet to explain how both computing and physical 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you can scan a few people, the issue is automation and automated
<br>
fabbing of infrastructure. Given the state of the world required for a
<br>
successfull upload it doesn't require a lot of technological advances to
<br>
scale up the procedure to billions of people.
<br>
<p>As an analogy, it took a lot of time and resources to sequence the human
<br>
DNA. It probably won't take longer than two decades before sequencing of
<br>
individual's DNA becomes commonplace, using desktop devices and normal
<br>
healthplan budgets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; enough to account for such an enormous technological disparity.  Or do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have any specific laws in mind?
</em><br>
<p>None of those backed by the barrel of the gun this time. Just plain
<br>
technological progress over the course of a decade, or two (projected to
<br>
happen several decades downstream from now, almost certainly less than a
<br>
century).
<br>
<p>I'm noticing I'm overposting, so I'm going to cease now. Sorry for hogging 
<br>
the channel.
