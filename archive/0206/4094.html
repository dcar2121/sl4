Robert Bradbury requested that I forward this to SL4:
<br>
<p>
<br><p><strong>attached mail follows:</strong><hr>
<br><p>
<p>Mitch Howe recently contributed a long exploration of the various ways
<br>
nanospawn could be used to create a plague to wipe out humanity as
<br>
an argument for promoting a safe singularity soon.
<br>
<p>I don't buy his argument and I encourage others not to do so.  Here is
<br>
how I look at it -- any &quot;group&quot; with &quot;magic&quot; technologies can wipe out
<br>
any &quot;group&quot; lacking &quot;magic&quot; technologies.  We have existed in that
<br>
state for the last several million years and exist in that state today.
<br>
Historically, nature (in the form of viruses and bacteria) had the
<br>
&quot;magic&quot; technologies and were fought to rough balance by our immune
<br>
systems.  Then humans came along and developed everything from gunpowder
<br>
to mustard gas to atomic weapons, any of which could have wiped out
<br>
significant fractions of humanity but we managed to develop the means
<br>
to defend ourselves against these various technologies allowing most
<br>
of us to avoid a premature death.
<br>
<p>The same will be true for nanotech.  If one allows a group hell bent
<br>
on eliminating you to gain significantly superior technological
<br>
capabilities then all bets are off.  If one balances any advances
<br>
in potential offensive capabilities with equivalent defensive
<br>
capabilities then the worry level should be no higher than it is
<br>
today.  There is a fundamental flaw in people arguing the risks
<br>
of a nanotechnology enabled group against the current state of
<br>
the world (non-nanotech enabled).  There seems to be an implicit
<br>
assumption that one (evil) group should be able to take a dominant
<br>
lead in the development of plague-spreading nanotech and everyone
<br>
who might become victims of such a situation are simply sitting
<br>
around sucking on their thumbs.
<br>
<p>The bottom line is this -- it doesn't matter *what* the technology
<br>
is -- if &quot;they&quot; can hurl more matter or energy at you than you have
<br>
the ability to defend yourself against you are toast.  If you have
<br>
the ability to defend against such attacks then you aren't.
<br>
<p>All of the toxins/spore spreading scenarios are easily dealt with
<br>
by having immune systems designed to recognize and eliminate such
<br>
materials.  This isn't that much different from how it has been over
<br>
the millions of years of evolution that have gotten us to this point.
<br>
<p>If you really want to be safe, you live in a deep underground bunker
<br>
where all incoming materials are irradiated with high levels of
<br>
radiation (to corrupt any nanobot programs), then run through
<br>
a plasma torch to disassemble any nanobots, then sorted by mass
<br>
to remove radioactive isotopes, leaving one to be fed with a
<br>
completely certified as safe stream of elements.  Using this
<br>
approach you would be *much* safer than you are today wandering
<br>
around in a world where everything from drunk drivers to flesh
<br>
eating Streptococci can kill you.
