<p>The Cyc knowledge base was developed on Symbolics Lisp machines. Now we
<br>
perform development with Franz Allegro Lisp developement software on
<br>
Linux. We actually program in SubL (Subset of Lisp) which is a
<br>
simplified lisp dialect of our own design which trivially translates into
<br>
C code for compilation and deployment on any gcc-supported platform.  Our
<br>
SubL system compiled into C contains a complete SubL interpreter and every
<br>
feature required to port arbitrary Common Lisp into SubL with the notable
<br>
exceptions:
<br>
<p>Graphics (Cyc uses HTML almost exclusively for GUI).
<br>
Lambda closures (write functions instead)
<br>
SubL requires explicit returns from all functions via RET function
<br>
<p>Two years ago I ported the open-source SHOP planner from Common Lisp to
<br>
SubL and it is now a part of Cyc's deductive inference engine.
<br>
<p>So our experience at Cycorp building a Good Old Fashioned AI system proves
<br>
your assertions about the preference of Lisp for our activities.  If we
<br>
represented our object store in Java rather than in our own SubL
<br>
(lisp) implementation, the storage requirements would balloon, because
<br>
Java has about a one hundred byte overhead for representing an object
<br>
instance. Regarding performance, Java doesn't know for example that the
<br>
great majority of KB objects are not going to be garbage collected, and
<br>
will have long interruptions dealing with a 400MB image.  And like
<br>
Smalltalk and Allegro Common Lisp, but unlike Java, our KB is implemented
<br>
as a memory-mapped file in Linux/Win32, so you save your state by saving
<br>
the file.  Java requires the creation or import of individual objects upon
<br>
application startup.  Java is fine for the applications to which Cyc
<br>
interacts and I have written the Cyc Java API to facilitate system
<br>
integration.
<br>
<p>I don't really care about whether software science has made substantial
<br>
progress in my (long) career, because my study of software engineering led
<br>
me back to the idea that AI is what software engineering needs to make
<br>
breakthrough progress.  My idea for Cyc, which I will soon circulate among
<br>
my Cycorp co-workers and OpenCyc collaborators, is to represent large
<br>
grained functional activities as Actions in the KB according to the
<br>
requirements of our Planner.  So each action has preconditions and
<br>
effects, and methods for accomplishing useful tasks are decomposed in a
<br>
hierarchy of sub-methods that bottom out at operations having direct code
<br>
support.  Then an interpreter can use the sequence of actions generated
<br>
from the planner (or a precomputed action sequence template retrieved
<br>
from a case library), to provided the desired behavior.  So the
<br>
software science advance would be the use of KB modifications alone to
<br>
produce changes in Cyc's behavior, rather than further enlarge the 1.5M
<br>
lines of generated C code.
<br>
<p>Regarding hardware progress, our compiled C runtime produces execution
<br>
traces that use the expected RISC-like handful of integer memory and
<br>
register instructions on the x86 architecture.  We use few floating point
<br>
operations.  So in my opinion, processor speed/performance improvements
<br>
following Moore's Law, are just fine.  Our Cyc benchmarks show speed
<br>
improvements directly proportional to the CPU MHz ratings.  There is some
<br>
debate here as to how to use multiple CPU/clusters/loose peer-to-peer
<br>
configurations.  I expect that Cyc would use multithreading on a multi-cpu
<br>
system, and server-to-server message-passing on clusters or P2P.  Most of
<br>
the research applications for which Cyc has been used would benefit from
<br>
parallel delegation of work.
