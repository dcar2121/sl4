<p>Sorry, I don't buy it.
<br>
<p>You just jumped the whole point.  If the first AI ran &quot;1000 times faster&quot; 
<br>
and &quot;could maintain thousands of details simultaneously in consciousness&quot; 
<br>
then it wouldn't be HUMAN EQUIVELANT, now would it?  You skipped 
<br>
human-equivalent AI and went straight to super-human AI.
<br>
<p>Plus, your assuming an AI would inherit everything a computer could do just 
<br>
because it runs on computing hardware.  Nothing says that the AI can keep 
<br>
more than 4-7 details in consciousness simultaneously.  Who knows, maybe 
<br>
the 1st successful human-equivalent AI can keep only 3 things resident at a 
<br>
time but thinks 3 times faster (which ends up balancing out, thus still 
<br>
being &quot;human equivalent&quot;).  Also, the speed of the hardware is 
<br>
irrelevant.  Doesn't matter if it was running on optical chips that ran 10 
<br>
million times faster than human neurons, if its human-equivalent it roughly 
<br>
thinks of the same things we do given the same amount of time.
<br>
<p>It is equivalent to a single human intellect.  Thus it does nothing more 
<br>
than add one more mind to the project (except, as I mentioned, that it can 
<br>
work more than 60/hours a week).  Then again, if it is truly 
<br>
human-equivalent maybe it gets burned out and bored if it works on the same 
<br>
problem more than 80/hours a week, which could throw a monkey-wrench into 
<br>
everyone's calculations.  We won't know until we get there...
<br>
<p>See my post &quot;How to gauge positive progress (was How hard a Singularity?)&quot; 
<br>
for further details.
