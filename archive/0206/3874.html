<p>Actually, hardware is not doing well at all. Software and hardware are
<br>
locked in a tango, where no player can make significant advances on his
<br>
own. Progress, if/when it happens, is thus necessarily incremental.
<br>
<p>All-purpose performance vs. transistor count has been lagging for a while.  
<br>
We know that complexity is a dead end as high clock is concerned, yet the
<br>
CPU cores are getting more complex, not less. Asynchronous logic doesn't
<br>
really help here. Fraction of utilized CPU transistors for a task is
<br>
getting worse as Moore advances. There is no hardware message passing in
<br>
any mainstream CPU architecture. Because current software model is mired
<br>
in bloat, embedded DRAM has a hard time, since on-die grain size is
<br>
limited by yield reasons. Because of absence of embedded DRAM the nonburst
<br>
memory bandwidth increase is stagnating. Bad die yield goes up
<br>
exponentially with die size for a given process, but since our software
<br>
model doesn't do parallelism, there's pressure for as large dies as
<br>
economically possible. This makes wafer scale integration, which requires
<br>
semiquantitative yields (~90%) impossible. Reconfigurable logic is not
<br>
there yet. Runtime reconfigurable, adaptive logic has so far only been
<br>
prototyped for stochastic architectures. Cellular architectures (the only
<br>
way to go to high clocks and defect tolerance) are barely on the drawing
<br>
boards.
<br>
<p>Given above toxic legacy, we're drawing orders of magnitude less
<br>
performance from a fixed amount of silicon real estate (say, a 300 mm
<br>
wafer in a modern process) than what would be possible in theory. Given
<br>
that premise, I'm distinctly underwhelmed by the claims, which just go GHz
<br>
MBytes magic mantra.
