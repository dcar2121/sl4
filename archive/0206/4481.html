<p>But, why must it do this?  I'm assuming that the military organization who 
<br>
created such an AI would consider this counter productive and, as such, 
<br>
attempt to not implement this portion of the system.  I'm not claiming this 
<br>
is wise, practical, possible or any such thing - only a likely action on 
<br>
their part.  Which is the root reason why I think such organizations and 
<br>
Friendly AI are mutually exclusive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;As you later say, the growing up of the infant AI might be unfavorably

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is an appealing analogy which happens to be, as best I can tell, 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Which part?  Are you saying that humans don't experience detrimental 
<br>
effects later in life related to early childhood emotional trauma, or that 
<br>
this is not applicable to AI.  If the later please explain why.
