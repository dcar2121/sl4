<em> &gt;&gt; rest of humanity.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This strikes me as phenomenally unrealistic, Eliezer.
</em><br>
<p>But at least we're finally discussing Friendly AI.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; The vast majority of the Earth's population consists of deeply religious
</em><br>
<em> &gt; people.  A decent percentage of these people think that a truly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; autonomous AGI is an abomination against their god!
</em><br>
<p>I rather doubt that a decent percentage have any opinion at all on the 
<br>
religious state of a seed AI, at least not right this minute, although of 
<br>
course this may change.
<br>
<p>In any case, there is a fundamental difference between agreeing on the human 
<br>
activities that constitute the entrance to the Singularity, and protecting 
<br>
the integrity, the &quot;impartiality&quot; if you will, of the Singularity itself. 
<br>
Debating how to manage existential risks is a human problem, and, yes, it 
<br>
may be impossible to please everyone.
<br>
<p>But it should be equally *true* for every individual, whether or not the 
<br>
individual realizes it in advance, that they have nothing to fear from the 
<br>
AI being influenced by the programmers.  An AI programmer should be able to 
<br>
say to anyone, whether atheist, Protestant, Catholic, Buddhist, Muslim, Jew, 
<br>
et cetera:  &quot;If you are right and I am wrong then the AI will agree with 
<br>
you, not me.&quot;  A Catholic programmer should be able to build an atheistic AI 
<br>
because it seems nearly certain that some of the beliefs we have now are *at 
<br>
least* that wrong.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I have respect for the beauty of the world's religious belief systems,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and for the art, poetry, music, and exalted human personalities they have
</em><br>
<em> &gt; helped produce.  But I still think these belief systems are profoundly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;wrong&quot; in many ways.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; And I don't think it's reasonable to expect that transhumanists and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; traditionalist Muslims are going to be in exactly the same position with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; regard to a Singularity-approaching AGI.  This just isn't plausible.
</em><br>
<p>Ben, I think that if history were to proceed at the current rate, no 
<br>
transhumans, no Singularity, for another hundred years, and you took the 
<br>
readership of SL4 and dropped us in 2102, then all of us including me would 
<br>
be shocked, outraged, and *frightened* at the options open to a solid 
<br>
citizen of the 22nd century.  Just because transhumanists talk about the 
<br>
Singularity doesn't make us transhumans.  You can't get a real picture of 
<br>
the Singularity by talking with the &quot;Singularity&quot; about other humans; the 
<br>
only way you could get a picture of the actual Singularity would be by 
<br>
talking with a transhuman.  Every one of our speculations about the 
<br>
Singularity is as much a part of the tiny human zone as everything else we 
<br>
do.  The real, actual Singularity will shock us to our very core, just like 
<br>
everyone else.  No, I don't think that transhumanists and traditionalist 
<br>
Muslims are in all that different a position with respect to the real, 
<br>
actual Singularity - whatever our different opinions about the human concept 
<br>
called the &quot;Singularity&quot;.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, don't be too fast to write off religious groups.  I agree that 
<br>
many religious individuals are likely to disagree about the pre-Singularity 
<br>
matter of Singularitarianism, but I have also seen religious people who have 
<br>
no problems with the Singularity.  I won't swear that they understood the 
<br>
whole thing, but what the heck, neither do we.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; A lot of traditionalist Muslims and other religious folks are going to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; think the AGI and Singularity are bad ideas because they are not in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; future history their religion has foretold.
</em><br>
<p>Again:  We need to distinguish the human problem of deciding how to approach 
<br>
the Singularity in our pre-Singularity world, from the problem of protecting 
<br>
the integrity of the Singularity and the impartiality of post-Singularity minds.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; It *may* be possible to define a kind of generic &quot;transhumanist ethics&quot;,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and ensure that one's AGI is imbued with generic transhumanist ethics
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rather than with with the quirks of a programmer's individual ethics.
</em><br>
<p>But a transhumanist ethics might prove equally shortsighted by the standards 
<br>
of the 22nd century CRNS (current rate no Singularity).  Again, you should 
<br>
not be trying to define an impartial morality yourself.  You should be 
<br>
trying to get the AI to do it for you.  You should pass along the transhuman 
<br>
part of the problem to a transhuman.  That's what Friendly AI is all about.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; But I am not sure how easy it will be to define a generic transhumanist
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ethics, either.  For instance, we have seen that among the different
</em><br>
<em> &gt; transhumanists on this list, there are very different attitudes toward
</em><br>
<em> &gt; warfare.  My strong preference is to have the AGI believe killing is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wrong in almost all circumstances.  Evidently some transhumanists
</em><br>
<em> &gt; disagree. Should I then refrain from teaching the AGI that killing is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; wrong in almost all circumstances, because by doing so, I am teaching it
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Ben Goertzel ethics instead of genetic transhumanist ethics?
</em><br>
<p>Whatever you teach the AI is, under Friendly AI, raw material.  The AI uses 
<br>
it to learn about how humans think about morality; you, yourself, are a 
<br>
sample instance of &quot;humans&quot;, and an interim guide to ethics (that is, your 
<br>
ethics are the ethics the AI uses when it's not smart enough to have its 
<br>
own; *that* is not a problem).  In the long run, why should the AI pay 
<br>
attention to your sample material over anyone else's?  Seriously, why 
<br>
*should* an AI pay more attention to you than anyone else on the planet? 
<br>
Morally speaking.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I am not sure it's possible to teach a system ethics as a set of abstract
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  principles, only.  Maybe  most of the teaching has to be teaching by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; example.  And if it is teaching by example, there's going to be a fair
</em><br>
<em> &gt; bit of individual bias in the selection of examples....
</em><br>
<p>Teaching the system ethics as abstract principles doesn't help at all with 
<br>
the moral problem; whose abstract principles would they be?  But if you give 
<br>
the AI information about your own morality, it may enable the AI to 
<br>
understand how humans arrive at their moralities, and from there the AI 
<br>
begins to have the ability to choose its own.
