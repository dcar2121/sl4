<p><p>Well, in my personal opinion and speaking plainly, disowning 
<br>
one's species, literally all of humanity include one's self and 
<br>
loved ones, for an unknown set of hopefully stable higher 
<br>
intelligences is a very deep form of treason and betrays a 
<br>
singular contempt for humanity that I find utterly apalling.
<br>
<p>Why should human beings care for or participate in setting up a 
<br>
Singularity if it has a large likelihood of being the end of 
<br>
them all instead of rosier alternatives like uploading them? 
<br>
Why shouldn't they fight the development of deployment of such 
<br>
for their very lives?

<em>&gt; Biological weapons.  This is it.  This is the one that is going to cook 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our goose if we don't take drastic action now.  There are at least 25 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries developing bio weapons.  Many bio agents have already been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created that could destroy human civilization and more are being 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; government lab someday soon.  The technology for recombinant genetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering is rapidly climbing down the scale of general availability.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the government labs don't get us the garage experimenters or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists will.  There is also the possible though less likely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accidental creation of a killer virus in one of the many university, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business labs.  The perfect bio weapon would be a virus of maximum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contagion such as flu, combined with maximum lethality such as marburg, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clandestinely disseminated in a location of maximum dispersion such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an airport.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>It is actually not a simple matter to design a bug that has the 
<br>
right level of lethality at the right pace and disperse it 
<br>
widely enough.  If it is too virulent and lethal then it burns 
<br>
itself out before it can spread.  If it is too slow then 
<br>
counter-measures will be more likely to be successful.  It is 
<br>
not so simple as just opening a jar of nasties in the middle of 
<br>
an airport by far.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, the danger is real enough.
<br>
<p>There is also a massive danger of governments and multinationals 
<br>
going totalitarian and rigourously suppressing all reasearch and 
<br>
development that does not bolster their power and their moneyed 
<br>
interests.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What to do?  As much as I hate the idea, the best option I see is to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlaw privacy.  But this does not seem to be practical in the present 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political environment.  Alternatively we could treat bio viruses like 
</em><br>
<p><p>This is totally the wrong answer.  A fully transparent society 
<br>
only works in an environment of sane laws and sane makers and 
<br>
enforcers of laws.  We have neither.  Full transparency would be 
<br>
more helpful (both government/industry and individuals having no 
<br>
privacy) than the one-way variety that is far more likely and 
<br>
being speedily implemented with or without official policy.
<br>
<p>In a society where the vast majority are relatively irrational, 
<br>
unimaginative and lacking any great intelligence, full 
<br>
transparency would mean that that majority (or those most adept 
<br>
at its manipulation) would fully be able to control the 
<br>
creative, highly intelligent minority from whom most of the 
<br>
progress toward SIngularity will come.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; computer viruses, with firewalls and antiviral software.  Firewalls 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would consist of each home being equivalent to a level 3 bio containment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facility with hepa filters and decontamination air locks.  When you went 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside you would wear a racal hood with a virus filter and exhaust fan 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with a virus impervious body suit.  The anti-virus software would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be by subscription to a daily antibody update.  This would require the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of systems that could make a vaccine for a new virus in 24 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hours or less.  We are not quite there yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><p>How about we just grow a lot more sane human beings instead of 
<br>
digging continuously for technological fixes that really aren't 
<br>
fixes to the too often cussedness of local sentients?  Replacing 
<br>
them with something that is faster and arguably smarter but may 
<br>
or may not be any more wise is not an answer.  Scrapping 
<br>
sentients is to be frowned upon even if you think you can and 
<br>
even do create sentients that are arguably better along some 
<br>
parameters.
