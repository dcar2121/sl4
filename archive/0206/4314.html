<em>&gt; &gt; I didn't work on the moonshot or the Genome Project, but I think AI will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take substantially less money and substantially more intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to solve.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I'm not sure what you mean when you say &quot;AGI will require
<br>
substantially more intelligence than any prior breakthrough in science.&quot;
<br>
<p>These past scientific breakthroughs involved the collaboration of many
<br>
genius-level humans over long periods of time.  We don't have access to
<br>
smarter people than were involved in these breakthroughs.  As smart as you
<br>
or I might be, we're obviously in the same ballpark as loads of other
<br>
scientists in the past....
<br>
<p>Are you referring to
<br>
<p>A) the intelligence that will be required by the team that actually builds
<br>
the AGI directly?
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p>B) the *total* collective intelligence of all people whose work will
<br>
contribute directly or indirectly to AGI?
<br>
<p><p>If A, then your statement implies that AGI engineering is almost surely
<br>
unsolvable by humans... I don't think any human AGI team can deploy
<br>
&quot;significantly more intelligence&quot; than the teams underlying great
<br>
scientific/engineering achievements of the past.
<br>
<p>If B, then you could be right, and AGI could still be achievable.  There are
<br>
more &amp; more scientists on Earth, and better and better technologies for
<br>
information dissemination.  Modern scientific discoveries generally deploy
<br>
far more *collective* intelligence than scientific discoveries from decades
<br>
ago did.
<br>
<p><p>In terms of the amount of $$ spent on AGI, if AGI can be achieved on a low
<br>
budget, it's obviously because of the huge amount of $$ put into related
<br>
commercial technologies like computer hardware....   One of the nice things
<br>
about AGI work is that it can be done on commodity equipment (computers),
<br>
not requiring rare and costly equipment.  This makes it easier for the
<br>
deployment of broadly based collective intelligence toward solving the
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>In any event, as I said before, I think we humans tend to overestimate the
<br>
difficulty of the AGI problem due to an emotional attachment to our own
<br>
intelligence.  It is a very very hard problem, but I doubt it is so much
<br>
harder than other very very hard problems humans have cracked in the past.
<br>
<p>But only time will tell ;)
