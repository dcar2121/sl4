<em>&gt; hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you plan any &quot;containment&quot; features as part of your protocol?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As already stated on this list several times, we intend to give Novababy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read but not write access to the Internet, at first, until a lot of study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been done.
</em><br>
<p>Please describe how this works.. as I'm not sure you know, simply sending
<br>
a request to a vulnerable web server formatted in the proper way will
<br>
result in the potential for a virus or whatever to be implanted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Again, I ask: do you plan to publish publicly any kind of basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of your experimental protocol, and how it works at every step of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI design and testing to lower risks? It doesn't have to be now, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think it should be available at a bare minimum 6 months before you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expect to have your full code up and running.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, we will publish this publicly.  I can't promise it will be 6 months
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the codebase is complete, but it very likely will be, as this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something I'll work on after the Novamente book work is done, and writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Novamente book should take less time than completing the codebase!
</em><br>
<p>Why not just agree, here and now, to have it ready 6 months before? If it
<br>
turns out to take longer than the coding, then you agree not to actually
<br>
start running the code for a period of 6 months after you publish the
<br>
protocol and related documentation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, since nowadays you are talking about having some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; committee make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the final decision,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, as I said very many times on this list, what I thought was a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea was an *expert advisory board*, intimately involved with the project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it reaches near-takeoff stage.  This does not imply that the advisory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; board has final decision making power.
</em><br>
<p>Why not give them the power if you truly believe they have a higher level
<br>
of combined wisdom than yourself?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if they come back to you and say &quot;The .01%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; calculated that your AI will go rogue at some point in the far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future is too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; much in our opinion. Pull the plug.&quot; you will pull the plug?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In that exact case, Brian, it would be a hard decision.  A .01% chance of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI going rogue at sometime in the far future is pretty damn small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I'd really like the experts for is to help arrive at the .01% figure in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first place, actually...
</em><br>
<p>So at this point, you can't answer my question? I guess it is one of those
<br>
things best left to the heat of the moment :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Higgins seems to want &quot;hundreds or thousands of relevant experts&quot; to agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is ok for you to &quot;push the big red button&quot;. Are you ok with that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not OK with that, but I believe he backpedaled on that particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion.
</em><br>
<p>He backed away from &quot;thousands&quot;, but not &quot;hundreds&quot; as far as I can tell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A consensus among a large committee of individualists is not plausibly going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be achieved on *any* nontrivial issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What if they did?
