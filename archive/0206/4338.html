<p>
Steve,
<br>
<p>I don't really understand the sense of your question (&quot;instrumentation&quot; ?),
<br>
so I'll let someone else answer it.
<br>
<p>However, my view is that, *in a system as rooted in symbolic knowledge
<br>
representation as Cyc*, it can't be very hard to create an initially
<br>
Friendly goal system, dependent upon an AI system's initial understanding of
<br>
Friendliness and its initial way of incorporating goals into its behavior.
<br>
[In a system based solely on Hebbian reinforcement learning, for instance,
<br>
wiring in an initially Friendly goal system would be much less
<br>
straightforward].
<br>
<p>The hard part is: If one creates a system that is able to change its concept
<br>
of Friendliness over time, and is able to change the way it governs its
<br>
behavior based on &quot;goals&quot; over time, then how does one guarantee (with high
<br>
probability) that Friendliness (in the designer's sense) persists through
<br>
these changes.
<br>
<p>This may not be a problem for Cyc because Cyc has relatively limited
<br>
self-modificatory capability.  (Cyc can, I assume, modify its definition of
<br>
Friendliness -- but still its definition of Friendliness will always be
<br>
explicitly given and humanly readable, so that if the definition changes for
<br>
the worse a human can just revise it... and for the foreseeable future I
<br>
suppose Cyc can't modify the way it uses goals to determine its behavior,
<br>
except perhaps by modifying some pertinent parameters.)
<br>
<p>So the major flaw I see in the Friendly Ai concept -- lack of persistence of
<br>
Friendliness thru self-modifications -- probably won't be a worry in Cyc,
<br>
for the same reasons that I think Cyc will never be a real AGI in anything
<br>
near its current form:
<br>
<p>a) Cyc relies only (or primarily) on explicitly given knowledge, not having
<br>
a major role for implicit, emergent, attractor-style knowledge
<br>
<p>b) Cyc's control structures are rigid and based on simple hard-wired control
<br>
rules, rather than being learned by a sophisticated &quot;procedure learning&quot;
<br>
methodology that is tightly integrated with the system's declarative
<br>
knowledge base
<br>
<p>When and if you ever expand Cyc to overcome restrictions a) and b), you will
<br>
potentially run into issues with &quot;Friendliness drift&quot;, if indeed you have a
<br>
Friendly goal system in Cyc at that time...
<br>
