<p>
Eugene,
<br>
<p>I've been writing software since 1980 or so.  In my view, there has been
<br>
significant progress in the software domain.  Obviously, progress in this
<br>
domain is harder to objectively measure than in the hardware domain, as
<br>
there are no simple metrics like &quot;CPU time&quot; or &quot;memory size.&quot;  However, with
<br>
sufficient effort, it should be possible to compare the man-months required
<br>
to create and maintain a software project of a given complexity, then and
<br>
now.  Maybe someone has done this already.
<br>
<p>My own view is that the more complex software projects being undertaken
<br>
today, would hardly have been possible using the software tools of 15-20
<br>
years ago.  Certainly, prior to scalable, distributed-processing friendly OO
<br>
software technology, something like Novamente could not have been attempted
<br>
by a small team.
<br>
<p>I think the Net has made the development of complex software much faster,
<br>
because there are so many sourcecode snippets and open-source projects and
<br>
messageboards out there to look at.  Before the Net, it was a hell of a lot
<br>
harder to find useful &quot;lore&quot; about how to solve various difficult software
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>I don't enjoy using Visual Basic or Visual C++, but these tools have clearly
<br>
made it much easier for *average people* to produce software that *average
<br>
people* can use.  This is not the kind of progress that excites scientists,
<br>
but it is an important kind of progress, and it's been accelerating fast.
<br>
<p>Creating a distributed application, as Ben H points out, is WAY easier now
<br>
than in the 80's or early 90's.  There's no comparison.  Java and .net make
<br>
it easiest, but even in vanilla C++ there are so many handy libraries for
<br>
such things out there... this sort of thing didn't exist back in the day....
<br>
<p>Software technology has not progressed in quite the way I would have liked
<br>
it to.  I'd like to see specialized chips for graph rewriting to enable
<br>
efficient  Etc. Etc. However, there is no question in my mind that software
<br>
technology has progressed very rapidly in directions that society has found
<br>
useful....
<br>
<p>Saying software tech hasn't progressed because it hasn't progressed in *your
<br>
directions of choice* is like saying hardware tech hasn't progressed because
<br>
it hasn't moved substantially toward massively parallel computing...
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eugen Leitl said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Software progress is stagnating, and the current software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; model is locking in current hardware model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in my world.  The new languages I love such as Java and C# do result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in higher productivity for me -- which in turn means I can write more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient and complex programs with less effort and in less time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Modern languages have higher productivity for three main reasons: more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precise/useful language constructs, managed environments, and better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed libraries.  Both of these languages, C# and Java, are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware agnostic in that they both compile into platform independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;bytecode&quot;.  There are now versions of Cobol, C++, Eiffel, and Visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basic that also compile down to platform independent &quot;bytecode&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that software is doing a lot better that you believe. :-)
