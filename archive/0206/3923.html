<em>&gt; (Forwarded here because of some previous discussions about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether a seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; team could plausibly work together over the 'Net; I think probably not.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am well aware of these statistics, and I experienced the phenomenon in
<br>
question myself.
<br>
<p>At Webmind, we made a mistake when we expanded our office in early 2000;
<br>
there was no more room on the 21'st floor so we expanded onto the 16'th
<br>
floor, which was also on a different elevator bank.  Business &amp; product went
<br>
on 16, R&amp;D and IT went on 21.  Bad idea.  Soon I was the only one going back
<br>
and forth every day between both floors.  In effect, the company split in 2.
<br>
Things were better when Andy (the CEO) and I shared an office with Suzi, one
<br>
of the lead AI developers....
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the communication between the Brazilian R&amp;D staff and
<br>
certain members of US (21'st floor) R&amp;D staff were *extremely* close,
<br>
including both planned and unplanned communications, and both formal and
<br>
informal interactions.
<br>
<p>It seemed to me that
<br>
<p>1) when there were &quot;natural distinctions&quot; combined with physical-space
<br>
distances separating two groups, the amount of inter-group communication
<br>
became VERY VERY SMALL
<br>
<p>2) when you had a distributed group working tightly together on a single
<br>
project:
<br>
<p>a) some people just didn't work out in spite of technical ability and
<br>
general people skills, because of somehow not fitting into the &quot;group
<br>
communicative vibe&quot;
<br>
<p>b) with the right set of people, communication was pretty damn good
<br>
<p>Informal, &quot;chance&quot; communications between people on the same team occur in
<br>
the form of asides in e-mails, in chat sessions and phone calls that range
<br>
widely, etc.
<br>
<p>It is *harder* to find a mix of people that can work well as a distributed
<br>
team, than to find a mix that can work well as an in-person team.  But my
<br>
experience is that it is not impossible.  I am working right now with a
<br>
distributed team and enjoying it very much.  Would I rather we were all in
<br>
one place?  Sure.  But would I trade *this* team for any other team, even if
<br>
the other team were located all in one place?  No again.
<br>
<p>Yeah, all the core members of our team know each other in person, and have
<br>
met each other in person repeatedly over the years.  But there have been a
<br>
few recent additions to the team, who none of the other team members has
<br>
ever met in person, and who are working out *splendidly* well from my point
<br>
of view.  DEFINITELY, the process of getting these new distributed team
<br>
members up to speed would be TEN TIMES EASIER if they were in the same room
<br>
with me and the entire rest of the team.  On the other hand, I would take
<br>
this handful of new guys in a second over, for instance, THE ENTIRE
<br>
CLASSROOM FULL OF STUDENTS from the AI class I taught at UNM this
<br>
semester....
<br>
<p>In short, I think it is WAY too strong to say that a distributed team &quot;could
<br>
not plausibly work&quot; for building a seed AI.
<br>
<p>Does having a distributed team pose an extra challenge?  Definitely.  But I
<br>
would rather take that challenge, than take the alternative challenge of
<br>
having a team that isn't the best of the best.  And the alternative of
<br>
bringing the best of the best to one location is only possible if you're
<br>
REALLY REALLY well funded.  Webmind Inc. was almost there, but not quite,
<br>
because, even though we could pay good salaries in New York, some people who
<br>
were really great just didn't want to relocate for personal and family
<br>
reasons.
