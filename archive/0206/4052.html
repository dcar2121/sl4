<em>&gt;&gt; First off, attachment to humanity is a bias that prevents rational

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the rest of humanity, where the death of all human genes is a big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; problem to cause a person to give up a goal or die to save humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I sense a possible confusion here between loyalty to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes and loyalty to the actual extant 6,000,000,000 living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.  I have no loyalty towards the former, and in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly hope that we all get uploaded and saved from our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frail genetic housings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not agree with Eugen that you should be shot on site or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently imprisoned.  If I were on a star ship, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would take whatever actions necessary to make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you never got near the control room.  I want to live.  I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want everyone else to live (forever).  I'm appalled at your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicidal urge to replace us and our experiences with something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknown and (from some biased itself point of view) &quot;better&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I certainly have compassion for humans.  I really do want humans to be 
<br>
uploaded.
<br>
<p>At the same time, if it turned out that we couldn't upload, I wouldn't 
<br>
say &quot;okay, that's it, no Singularity or SIs&quot; (this is as much a death 
<br>
sentence to humans as killing them outright).
<br>
<p>I don't see uploading humans as the goal of the Singularity, though.  I 
<br>
see the goal as creating a good successor to humanity; to creating a new 
<br>
intelligence that is beyond our own.  If we can benefit from that, I say 
<br>
all the better (I wouldn't support Friendly AI if I thought that a good 
<br>
course of action would be to create an SI with no regard for humans).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Funny, though, how the longer one lives the more precious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life seems to become.  They draft 17 year olds because they'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fearlessly charge machine gun nests.  I myself at 19 thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the human race would be better off not existing just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because, as you wrote, the &quot;world is full of pain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering&quot;.  (What I failed to see at the time is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's equally full of joy and gladness, and it's obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now how evolution had to make it so.)
</em><br>
<p>There are plenty of good things in life and in humans.  We've done 
<br>
plenty of good things.  I hope that we'll go on to do more good things 
<br>
and transcend into a new level of intelligence.  At the same time, if we 
<br>
don't ever get anywhere, it doesn't matter.  If humans lived in caves 
<br>
and ate bugs and never did anything new ever, the universe would hardly 
<br>
miss them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Some of us, myself included, see the creation of SI as important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enough to be more important than humanity's continuation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yikes!
</em><br>
<p>I imagine this does sound scary.  It seems very hard to say that I want 
<br>
humans to stay alive, but at the same time say that much as past human 
<br>
species failed to give way to ours, we may have no choice but to give 
<br>
way to our successors.  I hope that we can transcend with them, but if 
<br>
we can't then we have to learn to deal with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It's in the interests of the Singularity and SI goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that I not die, because my death would set back the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; project quite a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hollywood's mad scientists are not just figments of imagination!
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure where you're going with this.  Are you suggesting I'm a mad 
<br>
scientist?  Just making a general comment?
<br>
<p>Besides, Eliezer does the laugh much better than I do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Especially everyone else, because if we all die then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the goal can't be completed at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I too think it's great when a region of space begins to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, when matter benefits.  And, yes, we poor humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't do much benefiting per cubic meter and our plants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and animals are even more pathetic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But at the same time, like I said, for many of us our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lives and benefit are simply not negotiable.
</em><br>
<p>I'm aware of that, which makes compassion for humans a very good 
<br>
economic decision, let alone a good ethical one.
