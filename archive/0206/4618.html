OK Eli,
<br>
<p>Here is some straight poop for you
<br>
<p>I asked a Zen Buddhist abbot (one step up from a priest) whom I know your
<br>
question, via e-mail.
<br>
<p>This abbot happens to also have a physics PhD and to currently work in the
<br>
software industry.
<br>
<p>I gave him your exact wording:
<br>
<p>&quot;Do you believe that an extremely intelligent mind - not necessarily a
<br>
human mind - that was just trying to get at the truth, without reference
<br>
to either faith on the one hand or prideful denial on the other, would
<br>
be able to see that a lot of things asserted by Zen Buddhism are true,
<br>
and a lot of things asserted by other belief systems including atheism
<br>
are false - enough that if the mind had to pick out which religion was
<br>
most likely to be right, it could pick out Zen Buddhism as the most
<br>
likely candidate, regardless of whether the mind actually decided to
<br>
become a practicing Zen Buddhist and so on?  Assume that the intelligence
<br>
can not only do extremely thorough scans for evidence in the external
<br>
world but that it can also look into human minds.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here was his reply:
<br>
<p>&quot;For your friend's question, there is an assumption that needs to be
<br>
addressed.  That is, that intelligence (naturally being of the intellect -
<br>
neural pathways in the brain or other CPU processing information) has the
<br>
ability to ascertain the truth.  The mystic's view is that truth - Reality
<br>
- is only ascertained once we have transcended the mental framework of
<br>
experience - or, in Buddhist lingo, cause and effect.  We (our brains) talk
<br>
about reality in terms of sensory input, but the mystic subtracts all the
<br>
sensory input from the equation and says that what's left is all that's
<br>
real, and true.   Intellectually, this is appalling ... to suppose that we
<br>
can't think our way to the truth.  So, to a mystic, the rest of the
<br>
question doesn't make any sense, since the premise is wrong.
<br>
<p>&quot;Keep in mind that Zen means mediation, which, by definition, implies the
<br>
transcendence of the ego - the interpretive power that distinguishes right
<br>
from wrong - and it is only in this state that Reality is perceived
<br>
directly, i.e., without any &quot;filtering&quot; mechanism such as those that the
<br>
ego imposes.  All mystical traditions are the same in this sense - Zen
<br>
can't be superior to any of them since meditation is meditation regardless
<br>
of the training methods used to achieve that state.&quot;
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
