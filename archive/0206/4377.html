<p>I am married, and I disagree with you.  It is entirely possible to fully
<br>
understand what someone else intends by something... especially if they have
<br>
open and honest personalities and take the time to communicate thier mental
<br>
state as completely as they can.
<br>
<p>The life experiences gained by marriage can be complex and useful and
<br>
emotionally significant... but they come at a cost: you miss-out on other
<br>
experiences that are not marriage or marriage-related.  In your above quoted
<br>
post, you seem to be positing that there is some crucial experience that
<br>
married people have that is unavailable to unmarried people: that of knowing
<br>
if you can understand someone's intentions fully.  This is false.  Knowledge
<br>
of intentions has to do with communication and honesty, accurate
<br>
introspection and completion-of-effort.  Marriage is not a prerequisite for
<br>
these activities, and in fact often hinders them.
