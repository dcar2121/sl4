<em> &gt; That is whacky!!

<em> &gt; Inferring an intention in another human's mind is HARD... except in very

</em><br>
<p>I didn't say it was easy for an infrahuman AI.  I said that the sentence 
<br>
itself was an external reference.  This has implications for the AI's 
<br>
modeling of Friendliness regardless of whether the AI knows enough to unpack 
<br>
the external reference.  If X is an external reference to a design decision 
<br>
that is an external reference to the programmers' intentions, then it makes 
<br>
sense to change X if the programmers change their design decision as a 
<br>
result of seeing the previous version of X function in a way that conflicted 
<br>
with their intentions.  It's a question of where your roots are.  What is 
<br>
important to an early AI is not so much knowing *what* the roots are as 
<br>
knowing *where* the roots are.  Growing up and becoming independent of the 
<br>
programmers is something that depends on understanding *what* the roots are, 
<br>
but this is an advanced stage of Friendship growth, which may assume that 
<br>
the AI understands the programmers as black boxes.
<br>
<p>External references can never be completely unpacked in a messy physical 
<br>
universe; even a femtotech-level scan of your neural state a few years later 
<br>
may be insufficient to capture the full physical description of your mind at 
<br>
the moment of decision a few years back.  (Of course, all the *relevant* 
<br>
factors in the decision are presumably a bit easier to figure out than this, 
<br>
since similar factors will appear as relevant in other decisions as well.) 
<br>
The question is just whether it can be unpacked well enough to capture the 
<br>
information that's relevant to Friendliness; if a human notices anything 
<br>
amiss, that means the difference is noticeable enough to be distinguishable 
<br>
at our level of reality, and an SI should have no trouble picking it out. 
<br>
For that matter, an infrahuman AI can notice pretty subtle mistakes by proxy 
<br>
- if a human objects to something, then the actual objection typed into the 
<br>
keyboard is a very noticeable physical effect of which the mistake is the cause.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; It's hard for a human, even one with decent empathic ability.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It may be WAY WAY HARDER for a nonhuman intelligence, even one somewhat
</em><br>
<em> &gt; smarter than humans. (Just as, for example, a dog may be better at
</em><br>
<em> &gt; psyching out &quot;the intention in another dog's head&quot; than I am, because
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it's a dog...)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; I am very curious to see your design for your AGI's &quot;telepathy&quot; module ;)
</em><br>
<p>Initially an AI doesn't need to know *what* a programmer is, just *where* a 
<br>
programmer is; as the AI grows up mentally, it will find out *what* a 
<br>
programmer is; and as the AI finds out *what* a programmer is, it will grow 
<br>
up morally.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; What, Eliezer, was the intention in my mind as I wrote this e-mail?   I
</em><br>
<em> &gt; don't even know, fully!  There are many of them, overlapping; sorting
</em><br>
<em> &gt; them out would take me ten minutes and would be a badly error-prone
</em><br>
<em> &gt; process...
</em><br>
<p>Can I answer you after the Singularity?
