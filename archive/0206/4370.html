</em><br>
<p>Which correlates will with my theory on focus.  Jeff was brilliant but very 
<br>
diverse.  These &quot;other&quot; scientists, who may not have been as brilliant as 
<br>
Jeff, were likely more focused on the area of science where they made these 
<br>
accomplishments.
<br>
<p>Forgive me for constantly referring to myself, but I do not know the 
<br>
insides of anyone else's mind sufficiently to pull examples.  I am 
<br>
intelligent, last IQ test was in the low 140s.  I am not, however, a genius 
<br>
(wish I were).  There are MANY people out there much more intelligent than 
<br>
myself.  I am, however, very focused.  I spent the vast majority of my time 
<br>
between ages 8 and my late twenties thoroughly dedicated to Software 
<br>
Engineering and computers (networking, databases, etc.  The stuff that 
<br>
immediately surrounds Software Engineering).  Such focus coupled with a 
<br>
strong desire to improve, learn and optimize has tremendous 
<br>
influence.  Thus those 20 years probably equate to 50+ years of typical 
<br>
work in the field, putting myself significantly ahead of most (not all, by 
<br>
any means).  However, in many other areas I'm significantly behind the 
<br>
norm, having not put much if any effort into them.  Mechanically I'm 
<br>
useless, I break pretty much anything that has moving parts I touch.  My 
<br>
social skills are less than they should be.  etc.  This is my theory on why 
<br>
less brilliant people sometimes achieve much more than obviously more 
<br>
brilliant people.  I just wish I had focused a bit more energy into 
<br>
communication &amp; business skills as technical skills (but, then again, I'd 
<br>
be less effective).  Its all about trade-offs, after all.
<br>
<p>I believe Einstien was also extremely focused.  I read/saw somewhere that 
<br>
he always wore the same style/color of clothing, every day, to avoid 
<br>
distraction.  This may be completely untrue, but I imagine that even if it 
<br>
was there was probably some kernel of truth behind why this was 
<br>
fabled.  Forgive me for not knowing more but I haven't studied him (outside 
<br>
my focus area).
<br>
<p>Now, what I'd really like is to find someone truly brilliant who has 
<br>
focused as much energy in Software Engineering as I have.  I'd love the 
<br>
opportunity to work with such an individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In our own collaborations, we worked together quite well -- although I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*very quick* with math &amp; logical reasoning, he was even quicker and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considerably less error-prone; but I was always the one who came up with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out-there, sometimes-kooky, sometimes-excellent ideas that kicked our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research projects off....
</em><br>
<p>I do not think creativity and intelligence are directly connected.  I think 
<br>
creativity and intelligence should be considered parallel, separate abilities.
