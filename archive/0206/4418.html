</em><br>
<p>I suppose I am in the tiny minority who favor heavy government involvement.
<br>
Rather than try to persuade most of you why this is should be the case,
<br>
let me simply describe how I think events will unfold.
<br>
<p>Currently I manage Cycorp's participation in a Darpa project and I
<br>
trust this process - and believe it will work for ensuring Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>I believe that in time Darpa will sponsor research to address this
<br>
problem.  As evidence mounts that the Singularity is possible - such
<br>
evidence being things such as software systems capable of deliberative
<br>
goal seeking, learning, problem solving and self-improvement, then Darpa
<br>
will act. The recent Darpa Broad Agency Announcement for a 2003 project in
<br>
Cognitive Information Processing Technology is a small step in this
<br>
direction.  But in the out years 2004-2005 this project could lay the
<br>
foundation for a more ambitious follow-on.
<br>
<p>I speculate that a future Darpa BAA will borrow heavily from CFAI.
<br>
<p>It now occurs to me that Eliezer (or any other researcher on this
<br>
list), with goal of becoming a Darpa program manager or deputy program
<br>
manager, could begin a career path that would develop the required skills
<br>
and get the attention of Darpa management. I gave a brief presentation to
<br>
the Darpa EELD program manager yesterday and these persons enjoy wielding
<br>
the leverage they have over funded project participants.  You do not have to
<br>
possess a PhD, but publications and graduate work is desirable - you need
<br>
only to have a well thought out vision, and be able to communicate that
<br>
vision to senior Darpa management - in competition with other program
<br>
managers.  There is a good deal of turnover with Darpa PMs so Darpa is
<br>
allays looking.
<br>
<p>Another idea is to get some Darpa staff on this list. (Or are you already
<br>
lurking?)
<br>
<p>The European Union also sponsors AI research and it might happen that a
<br>
small EU project is the first to address what we call Friendly AI.  It
<br>
would be to the benefit of those of us here who wish to accelerate the
<br>
Singularity to encourage competition between the respective government
<br>
sponsors of such research - knowing that Darpa has the highest funding
<br>
levels.
