Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ben Goertzel wrote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; OK Eli,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Here is some straight poop for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I asked a Zen Buddhist abbot (one step up from a priest) whom I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; your question, via e-mail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've always wanted to have a long talk with a knowledgeable Zen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practitioner one of these days.  But I understand that it may be usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to spend a bit of time as a student before getting to talk to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; master, and alas, I have not the time.
</em><br>
<p>I've never talked to a Zen master, actually.
<br>
<p>My wife's master speaks only Chinese, and neither I nor Gwen speaks Chinese,
<br>
so no verbal interaction is possible!
<br>
<p>So, yeah, masters can be hard to get to, but priests and abbots are much
<br>
more accessible, and often willing to talk Zen with the outsider....  (This
<br>
particular order of rank is Chan, Chinese Zen... other kinds of Zen have
<br>
different hierarchical structures).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I have already said that Zen is a special case.
</em><br>
<p>What Aldous Huxley pointed out in &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot; (a book I
<br>
highly recommend) is that Zen is not a special case.  It's perhaps the
<br>
purest form of a tendency that's present in nearly every religion.  Sufism
<br>
is the Islamic correlate of Zen.     Gnosticism was a correlate of Zen in
<br>
early Christianity, and Huxley cites many others in more recent
<br>
Christianity.
<br>
<p>Nearly every religion has a sect whose teachings are nearly identical those
<br>
of Zen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If Zen is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of looking at the world that is beyond desirability or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undesirability - much like science in that respect, I've always thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - then within Zen a Friendly AI is not desirable or undesirable; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply *is*, whether the existence of a Friendly AI is a truth that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be reflected in the internal experience of a Zen practitioner, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an illusion to which no attention at all should be paid.  A Friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might fully understand a Zen practitioner, but what would the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practitioner care?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The original question I asked was whether a Friendly AI, if a given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion were true, would be able to jump to that despite being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed by atheists.  If Zen as described above is true, the Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI doesn't even *exist*.  So that still works out.
</em><br>
<p>What my abbot friend said was a little different.  What he said was that the
<br>
AGI mind's intelligence was irrelevant to whether it would experience the
<br>
truth of the universe or not.  Intelligence and truth-finding, in his view
<br>
(his interpretation of the Zen view), are simply unrelated.
<br>
<p>In a sense, Zen is about learning to ignore your programming and simply be.
<br>
So it might be said that the AGI's prospects for finding Zen-style truth are
<br>
pretty much independent of what kind of programming it's been given.  If it
<br>
has an inner stream of awareness, then it can focus on the truth of that
<br>
inner stream and transcend its programming, like any other mind.  But its
<br>
greater intelligence is just as likely to be a hindrance as it is to be a
<br>
help.
<br>
<p>One thing that's clear is that Zen Buddhists do not generally think of
<br>
themselves as following any kind of &quot;correspondence theory of truth.&quot;  You
<br>
may make a model of them and say that subconsciously they really are
<br>
following a correspondence theory of truth (and you could be right), but
<br>
that is not how they seem to consciously view their definition of truth.
<br>
Because correspondences are part of the analytical and perceptual mind,
<br>
whereas truth in the Zen view is about letting all that sort of thing fall
<br>
away.
<br>
