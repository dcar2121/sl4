<p>The problem, as I see it, has nothing to do with trust, honor or morality; 
<br>
only purpose.  I strongly believe the purpose a government or even a 
<br>
company would have for an AGI is incompatible with the concept of 
<br>
Friendliness.  By nature such entities wish to promote and protect 
<br>
themselves over all others.  They, at least in the case of governments, 
<br>
consider violence to be acceptable when they can't get the other party to 
<br>
agree via debate.  Attempting to create an AGI with these capabilities / 
<br>
goals is highly likely to fail.  The real problem is that it wouldn't 
<br>
necessarily fail by not working, it could very easily fail by working but 
<br>
not ending up Friendly.  In such a case no one (at least human) would 
<br>
benefit and most likely everyone human would suffer greatly.  Because this 
<br>
is the nature of governments and companies I don't expect that they would 
<br>
realize this is the case (a few individuals might, but that would be too 
<br>
late once the project was in motion).  Do you see my point on this 
<br>
issue?  Will you at least give this serious thought and consider what might 
<br>
happen if this were truly the case.
