<em>&gt;&gt;Of course, Pascal's Wager is a well-known (but modestly clever)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;fallacy.  Your analogous construction doesn't appear to do much better,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and for many of the same reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that many understand Pascal's argument to be fallacious, I have never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard of it referred to as a fallacy. (I've taught critical thinking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; university level, part of which occasionally studies fallacies like 'ad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hominem' 'post hoc ergo propter hoc' etc.) My argument has a similar form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is hardly an exact parallel. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps not a listed fallacy but let's run through it:
<br>
1) If I believe and act on X and X is true then I obviously gain;
<br>
2) If I believe X and X is false then I lose very little;
<br>
3) If I don't believe X and X is true then I lose;
<br>
4) If I don't believe X and X is not true then I gain little.
<br>
<p>The logic itself is empty because the relatively validity of any 
<br>
of the statements depends utterly on the qualities of X and the 
<br>
consequences of belief and non-belief of that particular X 
<br>
immediate and future.  It doesn't depend on the steps at all. 
<br>
In the case of belief in God it is not at all clear that (2) is 
<br>
low-cost.  It can be quite high cost if it has detracted from 
<br>
living life and seeking to extend and enrich life as much as 
<br>
possible for oneself and others.  Also (1) is not necessarily 
<br>
beneficial unless a lot of things are true about how God 
<br>
operates and what manner of belief and/or action &quot;wins&quot;.  The 
<br>
same can be said of (3).  The comments on (2) also apply to (4). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So overall, the form of this kind of argument adds nothing 
<br>
useful.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; For example, in Pascal's Wager I only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk my soul, here everyone else is at risk. Another disanalogy is this: in
</em><br>
<p>When applied to Friendly AI it is not clear that concentrating 
<br>
first on the Friendliness is the actual way to acheive AI, much 
<br>
less Friendly AI.  If we fail to accomplish AI at all, there is 
<br>
a downside risk that as our society and problems become 
<br>
increasingly complex they grow beyond our non-AI ability to deal 
<br>
with.  So (2) has a potential large downside.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the case of God, the prevailing scientific opinion is that God does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist, in contrast, there is very little agreement among scientists about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how or when to implement Friendliness. Ironically, your post comes pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close to the fallacy of guilt by association.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I was unaware that God was purported to dwell or exist within 
<br>
any realm that science has competency in.  It is not up to 
<br>
science to pronounce an authoriative opinion on the subject.
