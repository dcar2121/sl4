<p><em>&gt; See Eugen this is one of the major complaints people around these

<p>There's a misunderstanding. We've been both describing what should be 
<br>
done in an ideal world. Reality typically has its own ideas what should 
<br>
happen. Nevertheless, we owe it to ourselves and others at least to try.
<br>
<p>Based on what I've seen cryonics doesn't have a very high probability of
<br>
success (in terms of hard limits like information-theoretic death, not in
<br>
terms of tissue viability). However, given that cryonics is so easy and
<br>
cheap to validate (why, it's all just about quantifying irreversible
<br>
information erasure at neuronal ultrastructure level in a modern
<br>
vitrification process) and the impact of working radical life extension
<br>
*today* it should be investigated with a high priority. 
<br>
<p>Eliezer is absolutely accurate: people are dying today, and working 
<br>
cryonics could catch a fair fraction of them. Now.
<br>
<p>You mention &quot;perfect anti-aging&quot;. Perfect anything doesn't exist, and is 
<br>
not actually needed. It definitely looks like calorie restriction works, 
<br>
and we may be less than a decade away from a drug reproducing CR without 
<br>
requiring cutting down on calories, which people find very hard to do.
<br>
<p>If CR adds up to two decades longevity that means people will reach into a 
<br>
region of more advanced medicine. In any case they have more options, not 
<br>
less.
<br>
<p>Disease prevention is the domain of classical medicine, which has been
<br>
doing nicely. If we can be sure of anything, it is that medicine will make
<br>
further advances. I fully expect to see adaptive personal molecular
<br>
therapies towards the end of my life.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, rather than admit that there just might be a /possibility/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fixing all this via an AI technology that can be built and tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such a way as to be likely less risky than letting human uploads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run wild, you aren't interested in even seriously investigating.
</em><br>
<p>This is wrong. I think it definitely needs investigation, but in a 
<br>
controlled setting. I think that any naturally intelligent AI of up to 
<br>
slightly below human level is extremely useful and rather safe and 
<br>
something we definitely need, and be it for meek fabbing and transport.
<br>
<p>A few things are intrinsically dangerous (free environment capable 
<br>
molecular self-replicators (whether biological or machine-phase), 
<br>
superhuman AI) which need to be investigated very carefully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We do have differing reality models, and yours seems based on an utter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surety that AI must go evil or uncaring (or at least we can't tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what will happen). Perhaps this is why you never quite find the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to read CFAI. We've all certainly spent plenty of time trying to fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand your reality model, but I'm not seeing that flexibility on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your side.
</em><br>
<p>I promise to read and comment on CFAI. Unfortunately, it seems there is 
<br>
less and less free time to the day.
