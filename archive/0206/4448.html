Hi Stephen,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. I predict that regardless of sentiment expressed on this list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (perhaps indicative of popular sentiment worldwide), that as evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mounts that an AGI is possible, then government institutions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military research organizations will be the first to fund, and fund with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most money - thus sponsoring the progress of Seed AI to AGI and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps beyond.  If I am right, then you will see increasingly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambitious Darpa AI project announcements in years 2003, 2004 and 2005.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Currently Cycorp the company is behaving as though my prediction is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; track.
</em><br>
<p>I actually agree that there will be increasingly more ambitious DARPA AI
<br>
project announcements in the future...
<br>
<p>However, at this point, our differing intuitions about AI become relevant.
<br>
I have a feeling that DARPA will continue to pour the vast majority of its
<br>
funds into fairly &quot;conservative&quot; AI approaches like Cyc ;&gt;   Thus, as has
<br>
often been the case, even if the gov't spends a vast amount of money on AI,
<br>
it will almost entirely be wasted!
<br>
<p>It's not that I think Cyc is worthless, or that Cyc could *never* be
<br>
transformed in to an AGI.  But I think that the mainstream AI community is
<br>
hung up on some fairly unproductive approaches, and I include Cyc in that
<br>
category.  So I think that, with DARPA money focused on conventional
<br>
approaches,  we're looking at decades to AGI -- whereas I think that with
<br>
more innovative approaches (which DARPA will likely not be willing to fund
<br>
in the near future), progress can and will be made much faster.
<br>
<p>I know that DARPA's proposals often involve a language of &quot;innovation.&quot;  But
<br>
very often in the past, I've seen this used as a kind of feel-good
<br>
smokescreen for funding small various on the same old stuff...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I am wrong, then Seed AI and AGI will be developed some other way and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can observe/discuss events as they unfold.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed...
<br>
