<p>
I saw /Minority Report/ last night/this morning, the Steven Spielberg 
<br>
movie based on the PKD short story by the same name.  The short review 
<br>
is that your average person will like this movie and it's message, but 
<br>
transhumanist will (I hope) find that the plot is amiss in a few places 
<br>
that forces the ending.  I'm less vague below (i.e. spoilers follow that 
<br>
discuss the ending after some white space):
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>If you've read the story and liked the ending, you'll be disappointed.  
<br>
Of course, if you hated the ending, you'll get the one you were after.
<br>
<p>Despite my comments above, Spielberg has managed to create a fairly 
<br>
logically consistent plot.  The conclusion makes sense, but only because 
<br>
the plot was changed from the plot of the PKD story enough to make a 
<br>
happy ending possible.  In many ways, /Minority Report/ the movie has 
<br>
the same message as /Gattaca/:  humans triumph over technology.  The 
<br>
problem with MR the movie is that, unlike /Gattaca/, the technology is 
<br>
demonstratably making society better, so the only way to give the 
<br>
audience the ending that will make them feel good about being human is 
<br>
to change the plot so that there is an ethical dilemma that forces the 
<br>
system to fall apart, but only based on human biased ethics.
<br>
<p>The movie is okay and fits together well.  It's wrapped up in a nice 
<br>
little package for the audience, though, and doesn't make them think 
<br>
about anything.  /Minority Report/ the movie plays out exactly the way 
<br>
the (human) audience would hope that it would, given the events of the 
<br>
story.
<br>
<p>Of course, keep in mind that I haven't had weeks to think on this, so 
<br>
don't be too surprised to see a self reply in a month or so after I've 
<br>
had a chance to chew on this movie for a while.
