<p>That was just an example. Point is you can leech on the monetary system, 
<br>
more or less invisibly, at least on the short run to have enough game

money to play.

<p>We start with a meaningful seed in a small installation. This is not a yet

another worm hitting the Net. This means you have to shut down the Net
<br>
*completely* in order to purge it, as the world is a lot bigger than your
<br>
installation. This assumes that you at all know that something is afoot
<br>
(if you hack the routers you can even hide traffic from accounting), and
<br>
are not distracted by something -- e.g. a nuclear strike in progress is a
<br>
great smokescreen. Depending on a number of factors the system can seize
<br>
control of its own physical layer in hours to days. Notice that we're
<br>
talking a world several decades downstream, with lots more of fabbing
<br>
automation, and small-scale fabbing of molecular circuitry. This means
<br>
you're within touching distance of machine-phase nanotechnology if you
<br>
understand computational chemistry and can control molecular fabbing
<br>
capacities.

<p>I could see a lot of infrastructure being destroyed in sacrificial

smokescreen activities. After a brief while you can switch off everything

you can lay your fingers on, but it is too late already.

<p>Right, so it won't conduct high-profile activities and will lie low as
<br>
long as it is not yet entered bootstrap. Monkeys are not that hard to fool
<br>
if you haven't got a monkey to read.

<em>&gt; &gt;There is no such thing as a powerful human from a Power point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not true.  We recognize silver back gorillas, queens of ant colonies and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the head of a pride of lions.  Are they as powerful as us, no.  But we 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Can you give me a rational reason why I should consider them peers, and 
<br>
exercise enough restraint to tiptoe around them, while they're in the way? 
<br>
On the long run, I mean?
<br>
<p>Another question: what is your projected lifetime of the biosphere as we 
<br>
know it? (I.e. more or less what is currently left of it).
