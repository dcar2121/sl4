<p>I can imagine a lot of Singularity flavours that take several decades, or 
<br>
longer. This is plenty in terms of subjective monkey time.

</em><br>
<p>It depends on the threshold and the payoff factors. I don't expect a

desktop box suddenly exploding into a growth of nanofilaments overnight,
<br>
devouring the world, and then going up with taking a snack on the cosmos.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Somewhat slower, however, should be strongly considered.  The more we

</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It is, unfortunately, most likely that we won't be able to greatly
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Total shape, no. Outcome, no. But early stages, possibly. Seen from the
<br>
mountaintops, whether we monkeys make it or go extinct is completely
<br>
irrelevant. It is not going to make an observable difference in the end
<br>
state. However, we monkeys do see it differently. It is completely in our
<br>
paws to make a difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I still don't see it otherwise.  Unless we could somehow manage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continually upgrade a handful of HIGHLY TRUSTED humans to at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat keep pace with the Singularity I don't see how its possible.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I haven't heard of any real options for doing that...
</em><br>
<p>Life is uncertain. It doesn't mean we're doomed/shouldn't try.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Well, Eliezer has a problem with people dying.  The longer your wait
</em><br>
<p>Many people have problems with people dying. Though not nearly enough,
<br>
orelse we would start doing something about it some 30-40 years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to get the Singularity in full force the more people die (that's my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation of his vision, at least).  Personally, I'd rather let a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few hundred thousand people die while making certain that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity won't just wipe everyone out.  I mean, what's the point in
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this assessment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; rushing to save lives if everyone gets converted into computronium
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway?  My best guess is that the final result will be somewhere in
</em><br>
<p>Everyone but those who have died before the technology came online. You
<br>
certainly can't resurrect a person if given an urn full of cremation
<br>
ashes, or even mummified remains encased in permafrost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; between (but probably closer to Eliezer's wishes than I'd like).
</em><br>
<p>I'm expecting less control, not more of it. Lots more diversity, and a
<br>
much grander stage for the play called life.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Here I'm split.  Personally, I think if we try and wait that long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're making a major mistake.  There are STILL people who aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfortable with computers today.  To try and get humanity &quot;on-board&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There are still people who'll resist receiving modern medical treatment,
<br>
but I'm noticing there are not too many of them. It requires remarkable
<br>
testicular fortitude to remain true to one's convictions if confronted
<br>
with one's immediate personal demise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the Singularity would take centuries, which we don't have.  The most
</em><br>
<p>I think most people will be able to make an informed choice between being
<br>
left at the mercy of uncaring gods, or becoming a part of the pantheon.  
<br>
Especially, if there are members of the tribe who went ahead, and are
<br>
obviously liking it in there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; moral (in my opinion) option is to create the Singularity as fast as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible while maintaining a strong measure of safety (ie:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-extinction, slavery, indifference, etc).  And yes, I know actual
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; slavery would be pointless (we would be useless junk to an SI).  But
</em><br>
<p>No, you're a static part of the landscape to an SI. Food, in other words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we could be &quot;slaves&quot; by loosing much of our freedom &amp; choice, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too likely.  But, as mentioned earlier, I don't think we'll actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get this option (due to the Eliezers out there).
</em><br>
<p>We don't have that many Eliezers out there. In fact I would think there
<br>
are about some 10 of them world-wide right now.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; While I doubt we'll get the chance for a moderate takeoff, we should be ALL 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MEANS try.  It is never pointless to try and protect the entire human race!
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
