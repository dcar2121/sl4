Ben, while you are certainly correct in stating that Bunge's philosophy is
<br>
rather one-sided, I find it more interesting than, for example, Foucault,
<br>
whose historical researches--upon which he based his analysis of human
<br>
institutions--have been refuted by people who know more about the periods
<br>
and institutions about which he wrote. I'll grant that Foucault did have
<br>
considerable first hand-knowledge of human perversity, as evidenced by his
<br>
moral obtuseness regarding HIV (i.e., he knew he was infected but continued
<br>
to his promiscuous lifestyle nevertheless and without informing his
<br>
partners).
<br>
<p>Bunge's &quot;naive&quot; realism/objectivism is, as I said, one-sided but, to me, a
<br>
needed corrective to the radical subjectivism that has come to dominate in
<br>
many academic departments. You wrote that we live in a &quot;mind-created world&quot;
<br>
which we must acknowledge along with &quot;some common reality that we all
<br>
share.&quot; Do you consider this common reality to be a mind-consensus or an
<br>
objective reality that exists apart from human observers? (Do we need to
<br>
hear that tree fall in order for it to make a noise?)
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>
&quot;Embracing
<br>
this Zen koan of subjectivity/objectivity is the real challenge, and will
<br>
become even more of a pertinent challenge as virtual reality and
<br>
superintelligence-inspired reality transformations completely alter reality
<br>
as we know it.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>I would distinguish between changes to a virtual reality content (software)
<br>
and changes to the underlying substrate (hardware/objective reality). Both
<br>
can and will be changed by superintelligence. But I think that any
<br>
superintelligence that loses controlling contact over the material substrate
<br>
will be superceded by another superintelligence that does not.
<br>

Subject: RE: Books on rationality
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Bunge is particularly strong in his formulation of philosophical claims as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical propositions, and on his warranted (in my opinion) dismissals of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most Continental philosophy (from existentialism to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-modernism). I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found quite valuable his summary of outstanding philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be amenable to resolution along the lines he sets out in his books.
</em><br>
<p>Not surprisingly, I hold a different view ;)
<br>
<p>I find his formulation of philosophical claims in logical terms rather
<br>
shallow, and I radically disagree with his dismissal of existentialism and
<br>
postmodernism.
<br>
<p>The existentialists and proto-existentialists dealt with the issue of how to
<br>
think about morality in the absence of a false notion of &quot;objective
<br>
reality,&quot; far better than anyone else has.  I'm thinking of Nietzsche,
<br>
Sartre and Camus, primarily.
<br>
<p>Baudrillard's book &quot;Simulations&quot; (he's a French postmodernist sociologist)
<br>
is the best book on the phenomenology of virtual reality that I know; and
<br>
Foucault (often considered a postmodernist), in his books on prisons,
<br>
schools, and sexuality for instance, has plunged deeper into the perverse
<br>
peculiarity of human nature than just about anyone else.
<br>
<p>To me, accepting only philosophy that can be summed up in concise logical
<br>
propositions is like, well, trying to encode philosophy in CycL!   Just as
<br>
the deepest parts of commonsense knowledge cannot be conveniently encoded in
<br>
compact logical formulas, so the deepest kinds of philosophy cannot be
<br>
conveniently encoded in compact logical formulas.
<br>
<p>What is most interesting to me in late 19'th century &amp; 20'th century
<br>
philosophy is the attempt to forge a middle way between shallow, naive
<br>
rationalism/empiricism (which holds there is a single objective reality, and
<br>
a single right answer to every question), and total nihilism (which is the
<br>
most common conclusion those who reject the existence of objectivity come
<br>
to) -- *without* recourse to superstitious beliefs.  This is existentialism,
<br>
postmodernism, and other assorted freaks like Mikhail Bakhtin (an amazing
<br>
Russian literary critic and philospher, who created a notion of a
<br>
&quot;polyphonic&quot; reality that is neither objective nor solipsistic, but
<br>
collective).
<br>
<p>By putting himself in the &quot;naive objectivist&quot; camp, Bunge makes himself
<br>
completely uninteresting to me.  Refusing to acknowledge the fact that each
<br>
of us lives in our own mind-created world, is just as silly as refusing to
<br>
acknowledge that there is some common reality that we all share.  Embracing
<br>
this Zen koan of subjectivity/objectivity is the real challenge, and will
<br>
become even more of a pertinent challenge as virtual reality and
<br>
superintelligence-inspired reality transformations completely alter reality
<br>
as we know it.
