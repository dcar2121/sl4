Hi all,
<br>
<p>During the weekend IRC session the topic turned to ADHD.  Unfortunately I 
<br>
though that since I have spent a lot of time studying topics related to ADHD 
<br>
-- the dopaminergic system and its relationship to working memory, 
<br>
intelligence and drug addiction --that I could discuss ADHD in general with 
<br>
some authority.  I was mistaken and my knowledge of ADHD before and during 
<br>
the IRC session was very inadequate.
<br>
<p>In order to make up for my mistake I have interpreted and transcribed 
<br>
portions of an authoratative ADHD chapter from my neuropharmacology 
<br>
textbook: Charney, D.S. et al. 1999.  Neurobiology of Mental Illness.  
<br>
Oxford Press.
<br>
<p>If there are any specific questions in regards to this overview I would be 
<br>
happy to answer them.  This time I'll make an effort to base my answers in 
<br>
established research rather than just resorting to personal pet hypotheses 
<br>
or my favorite subsystem interaction for this month. ;-)
<br>
<p>Kind Regards,
<br>
Ben Houston

<p>ATTENTION DEFICIT / HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER *
<br>
<p>* Interpreted and transcribed from: Charney, D.S. et al. 1999.  Neurobiology 
<br>
of Mental Illness.  Oxford Press.
<br>
<p><p>Attention deficit disorder (ADHD) is an early onset, clinically heterogenous 
<br>
disorder of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.
<br>
<p>Diagnostic History
<br>
<p>Its recognition from a clinical perspective dates at least as far back as 
<br>
the 1930s.  The modern definition of ADHD could be seen in the ancient 
<br>
clinical definitions of 'minimal brain damage', 'minimal brain dysfunction', 
<br>
and 'hyperactive child syndrome.'  It first entered the standard DSM in 1968 
<br>
under the heading of 'hyperkinetic reaction of childhood.'  The modern 
<br>
definition of ADHD in DSM-IV lists 3 subtypes: (1) predominantly inattentive 
<br>
type, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, and combined type.  The 
<br>
diagnostic criteria in DSM-IV require clinically significant impairment in 
<br>
social, academic or occupational functioning.
<br>
<p>Childhood, Teenage and Adulthood
<br>
<p>Children with ADHD are easily recognized.  Their inattention leads to
<br>
daydreaming, distractability and difficulties with sustained attention
<br>
tasks.  Their impulsivity makes them accident prone, creates problems with 
<br>
peers, and disruptive in classroom settings.
<br>
<p>In their teenage years, symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity will
<br>
deminish, but in the majority of casese the symptoms and impairments of ADHD 
<br>
will persist.  The ADHD teen is at high risk for low selfesteem, poor peer 
<br>
relationships, conflict with parents, delinquency, smoking and substance
<br>
abuse.
<br>
<p>Although there is controversy surrounding the question of adult ADHD in the 
<br>
popular media, longitudinal studies have shown that as much as two thirds of 
<br>
ADHD children will have impairing ADHD symptoms in adulthood.
<br>
<p>Genetic Components
<br>
<p>Based on family studies, twin studies, adoption studies, and segregation
<br>
analysis studies it seems that there is a large genetic component to ADHD.  
<br>
The influence of genetics in the development of ADHD varies from between 0.6 
<br>
and 0.8 in studies.  The data suggests that there is no one ADHD gene but 
<br>
that ADHD results from the interaction of several genes.
<br>
<p>Biological relatives of individuals diagnosed with ADHD have shown
<br>
consistently poorer than normal scores on standardized tests of attention 
<br>
than do adopted relatives.  (Alberts-Corush et al., 1986)
<br>
<p>Biological Adversity
<br>
<p>As a result of many claims in the popular media that ADHD results from
<br>
specific foods or diets a series of systematic scientific studies have been 
<br>
conducted on this topic.  These studies concluded both that that food 
<br>
additivies do not cause ADHD and that 'the Feingold diet' was not effective 
<br>
in treating ADHD (Conners, 1980).
<br>
<p>Toxins though have been implicated in the etiology of ADHD.  Lead
<br>
containmination can lead to distractiability, hyperactivity, restlessness 
<br>
and lower intellectual functioning.  But it does not seem to be a factor in 
<br>
most ADHD cases and many children exposed to lead do not develop ADHD. 
<br>
(Needleman, 1982)
<br>
<p>Literature concerning pregnancy and delivery complications in assocation
<br>
with ADHD has not be conclusive.  Some evidence suggests that toxemia,
<br>
eclampsia, poor maternal health, maternal age, fetal postmaturity, duration 
<br>
of labor, fetal distress, low birthweight, and antepartum hemorrhage can 
<br>
dispose children to ADHD.  (Sprich-Buckminster et al. 1993)
<br>
<p>Smoking during pregnancy can can damage to the fetus's brain at critical
<br>
times in the developmental process.  Animal studies have linked chronic
<br>
fetal nicotine exposure to hyperactive offspring.  (Johns et al., 1992; Van 
<br>
De Kamp and Collins, 1994)
<br>
<p>Neurobiology
<br>
<p>At least as early at 1971 (Satterfield and Dawson, 1971) it was proposed
<br>
that ADHD results from frontolimbic dysfunction.  They suggested that weak 
<br>
frontal cortical inhibitory control over limbic functions might lead to 
<br>
ADHD.  The success of stimulant medications implicated the dopamine pathway 
<br>
and lead to more support for the frontolimbic dysfunction hypothesis. (Camp 
<br>
and Winsberg, 1984)  Further support was found in studies that compared 
<br>
symptomology between adults with frontal lobe damage and ADHD children.
<br>
<p>ADHD children perform poorly on standardized tests that require: (1)
<br>
organization of cognitive information, (1) inhition of motor responses, (3) 
<br>
planning, (4) complex problem solving, and (5) the learning and recall of 
<br>
verbal material.  Deficits were found to remain consistent into adulthood.
<br>
<p>Orbital frontal (ofPFC) lesions predict social disinhibition and
<br>
implusivity.  Dorsolateral (dlPFC) lesions affect organizational abilities, 
<br>
planning, working memory and attention.  Thus observed deficits in ADHD from 
<br>
standardized tests and from observation in social situations implicate both 
<br>
orbitofrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex dysfunction.  The mesial 
<br>
prefrontal region, where lesions predict dysfluency and slowing of 
<br>
spontaneous behavior, is not implicated in ADHD.
<br>
<p>Because of the limitations of modern neuropsychological inference it is not 
<br>
clear whether the dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex is due to
<br>
abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex itself or due to adnormalities in the 
<br>
related subcortical circuitry.
<br>
<p>Various brain regions are involved in the circuitry underlying the
<br>
prefrontal cortex.  The cingulate cortex is important in the motivational 
<br>
aspects of attention and in response selection and inhibition.  The right 
<br>
prefrontal and parietal cortex are activated in sustained and directed 
<br>
attention across sensory modalities.  The inferior parietal cortex and 
<br>
superior temporal sulcus are polymodal sensory convergence areas that 
<br>
provide a representation of extrapersonal space which is important in 
<br>
focusing and selecting target simuli.  The reticular activiting system 
<br>
regulates attentional tone.  The regicular thamaic nuclei filter sensory 
<br>
interference.  Working memory deficits implicate various regions including 
<br>
the anterior hippocampus, ventral anterior and dorsolateral thalamus, 
<br>
anterior cingulate, parietal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
<br>
<p>CT and MRI studies of ADHD children have found sulci widening and cerebellar 
<br>
atrophy -- this supports the hypothesis that ADHD is a subcortical syndrome. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies have noted hypoperfusion in 
<br>
the frontal cortex and hyperperfusion in the pareital cortex.  Glucose 
<br>
metabolism PET studies have found lower glucose metabolism in various brain 
<br>
regions associated with the attentional networks.
<br>
<p>Because of the efficacy of stimulant treatment studies have tried to find 
<br>
support for a catecholamine hypothesis of ADHD.  Such studies that looked at 
<br>
catecholamine metabolites have found conflicting results -- thus suggesting 
<br>
that no one single catecholamine neurotransmitter system can account for the 
<br>
available data.
<br>
<p>Pharmacotherapy Treatment of ADHD
<br>
<p>The drugs that effectively treat ADHD are known to modulate catecholamine 
<br>
pathways.  These include both methylphenidate, pemoline and 
<br>
dextroamphetamine.  Many studies have documented stimulant-induced
<br>
improvements in measures of vigilance, cognitive impulsivity, reaction time, 
<br>
short-term memory, learning of verbal and nonverbal material in children 
<br>
with ADHD.  Effects seem to be dose dependent.
<br>
<p>In addition to stimulants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) also play a role 
<br>
-- specifically imipramine.  Although most studies of TCAs in relation to 
<br>
ADHD have been brief (&lt; 2 years) they suggest that TCAs produce moderate to 
<br>
strong treatment effects.  Neuropsychological tests, in contrast to positive 
<br>
clinician ratings, shows varied response.  In comparison to stimulants 3 
<br>
studies have shown TCAs to be inferior, 5 studies showed TCAs were equal in 
<br>
effectiveness and 2 studies shows that TCAs were superior to stimulants.
<br>
<p>Nicotine has shown some effectiveness in attenuating ADHD symptoms.  This 
<br>
positive effect of nicotine may explain why individuals diagnosed with ADHD 
<br>
have a higher than average probability of smoking.
<br>
<p>Drugs that have not been effective in the treatment of ADHD include:
<br>
lithium, meprobamate, hydroxyzine, fenfluramine, dopamine agonists, amino 
<br>
acid precursors and caffieine.
