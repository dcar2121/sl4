</em><br>
<p>See, you have some suggestions for committee members already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;It is terribly dangerous to take away the job of Friendly AI from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;whoever was smart enough to crack the basic nature of intelligence!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Friendly AI is not as complex as AI but it is still the second hardest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;problem I have ever encountered.  A committee is not up to that!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;A committee may not be up to designing a Friendly AI (because design by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;committee is slow for one) but there is no reason they could not decide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;if a given design was SAFE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The task of verification is easier than the task of invention but is *not* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easy in any absolute sense.
</em><br>
<p>I never said it would be easy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; so why should we trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;whoever gets their first to make such major decisions?  Just because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;someone is INTELLIGENT enough to design an AI doesn't mean they are WISE 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;enough to use it properly.  Intelligence does not equate to wisdom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ah.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Intelligence does not equate to wisdom.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How many times I've heard that...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you think it's possible to build an AI without wisdom?  Forget whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you think I'm wise.  Forget whether I, personally, manage to create AI. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Consider how many times AI projects have failed, and the reasons for which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they failed.  Consider how much self-awareness it takes, or creates, to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reach an understanding of how minds work.  Building AI feeds off 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-awareness and, in feeding on it, hones it.  If you don't believe this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of me, fine; predict that I will fail to build AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is the task of building a mind.  It isn't a small thing to succeed in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;building a real mind.  I would consider it a far greater proof of wisdom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than membership in any committee that ever existed.
</em><br>
<p>I would not.  Building an AI would require intelligence, not wisdom.  I'm 
<br>
not certain if a person without a great deal of wisdom could construct an 
<br>
AI with a great deal of wisdom, though.  Haven't actually thought on that 
<br>
matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If I'm as lousy at this job as you seem to think, then I will fail to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;build AI in the first place.  The problem is harder than that.
</em><br>
<p>I never said you were lousy at anything, just over confidant and possibly 
<br>
egomaniacal.  Nor have I ever commented on your degree of intelligence (I 
<br>
do, in fact, think your intelligent).  I'm not certain that you are wise, 
<br>
though.  Which is primary because you seem far too convinced that your 
<br>
ideas above everyone else's are correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Then they're too big for N people to make and should be passed on to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Friendly SI or other transhuman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;So, how do you propose we find a Friendly SI or Transhuman to judge which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Singularity attempts will be safe?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't see how intelligence on that particular task is any greater for N 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people than for one person, nor do I see how the moral problem gets any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better unless you're conducting a majority vote of the entire human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;species, and even then I'm not sure it gets any better; minorities have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights too.
</em><br>
<p>A majority vote of the human species would never succeed.  They, and I 
<br>
don't like this opinion, can't even be trusted to elect government 
<br>
officials in most cases.  Not to mention that I just read that only 25% of 
<br>
the US population has much concept of what Scientific Method really is.  So 
<br>
this would obviously not work.
