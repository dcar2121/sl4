<p>Anyone incapable of taking advice or accepting criticism, who will therefore 
<br>
tend to fail at Friendly AI, will by exactly the same logic tend to fail at 
<br>
building AI.  If Friendly AI wasn't an issue and the only question was 
<br>
building AI as fast as possible, we'd be having the same argument except the 
<br>
punchline would be &quot;And if you don't take my advice, you'll fail at building 
<br>
AI and we'll be wiped out by smallpox++!&quot;
<br>
<p>Incidentally, one very real danger of having a Friendly AI Advisory Board is 
<br>
that the FAI programmers will listen to the advisory board... and *no one 
<br>
else*, including Chinese or Indian geniuses who write in broken English and 
<br>
never went to college but who happen to know exactly what the problem is and 
<br>
how to fix it.
<br>
<p>You know what I'd really like to see?  The Friendly AI Argument Repository, 
<br>
devoted to archiving all discussion of Friendly AI, which would also perform 
<br>
the service of examining new arguments and notifying interested programmers 
<br>
of anyone who seems to have anything really new and interesting to say. 
<br>
This would prevent programmers who are already working full-time on an 
<br>
incredibly absorbing AI project from tuning out all unsolicited emails on 
<br>
Friendly AI because 95% of it is repetitions of criticisms they've already 
<br>
heard. (Rationality, in feeding on criticism, uses it up.)
<br>
<p>We have different opinions about the Voice That Must Be Heard.  I think that 
<br>
such a voice is more likely to come from a complete unknown, or from some 
<br>
very smart person with no life, and is really not all that likely to come 
<br>
from the kind of people ordinarily asked to serve on advisory committees.
