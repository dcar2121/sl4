</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and that may be overoptimistic, depending on how much progress anyone's AGI

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I really think it's silly to call the idea &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;suicidal.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At worst, in my view, it would be a useless sideshow; and at best it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serve to infuse a very big decision with some additional wisdom.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, at worse it could easily:
<br>
<p>Politicize the entire process;
<br>
Freeze all development in bureaucracy and infighting;
<br>
Prematurely turn the wrong kind of attention on AGI development 
<br>
leading to great fear and persecution;
<br>
Result in the co-opting of the work for immediately profitable 
<br>
purposes and/or military use thus creating a more rather than 
<br>
less dangerous world.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember -- in my proposal, this is an *advisory* group anyway, so it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't have real power over what an AGI's owner does with it....  How then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could it be suicidal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If it had much publicity, honor, clout or power all the above 
<br>
scenarios are distinctly possible given normal human politics. 
<br>
If the world takes it seriously at all it will have all of these 
<br>
and stiff political competition to get on the committee and 
<br>
conflicting agendas.  I guarantee that the people (may their 
<br>
black little hearts be praised) and the politicians (whose even 
<br>
blacker hearts are generally damned) will not let the nerd only 
<br>
put super-nerds on a committee such as this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What you propose instead seems to be: &quot;The world should trust that whomever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first creates a seed AI, is probably wise enough to make all decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the advent of the Singularity.&quot;  I think your proposal is pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; darn dubious, as it relies on your psychological theory that only a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of supreme wisdom can possibly create a seed AI -- and I think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological theory is pretty darn dubious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is dubious on one hand.  On the other hand it is less dubious 
<br>
that one wise and capable person or group acheives the goal than 
<br>
to expect such wisdom and capabilities from what will fast 
<br>
become a politicized committee.  Human perfectability, where it 
<br>
exists at all, is usually not found in modern political committees.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't intend to spend my time currently forming committees, I intend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to spend it working on designing, engineering, testing and (later)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaching an AGI.  But if/when Novamente gets to near-human intelligence, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be wise enough not to trust my own wisdom, and I'm going to do what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've suggested: assemble a committee of Singularity wizards to help me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monitor Novababy's progress, help me teach the thing, and help make the deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions the thing will lead to...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think Singularity wizards are the only ones that should 
<br>
be consulted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I hope very much that, if *your* AGI design/engineering efforts bear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruit and produce a near-human-level AGI, you *at that point* will have seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the error of assuming that your AGI-creation prowess necessarily implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your immense personal wisdom... and I hope that you will, at that point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow some methodology similar to what I've described.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I still don't see how or where you are going to get this greater 
<br>
wisdom or how what you propose will produce a more safe and 
<br>
agreeable outcome.    We are talking about the innovation to end 
<br>
all innovations here!  We are talking about that which will turn 
<br>
every institution on Earth inside out and change everything 
<br>
forever for humankind.  Where, on this earth, will you find the 
<br>
mind or minds who are ready to take on this responsibility and 
<br>
who have the right balance to carry it off.  I have doubts that 
<br>
mind exists at all at this time.  But if it does exist I don't 
<br>
expect to find it in a committee.
