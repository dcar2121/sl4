hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, but no matter how transhuman an entity is it will still have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquire energy to run itself (food)
</em><br>
<p>It's energy req's may be sufficiently low that for it, obtaining energy is
<br>
much like obtaining air is for us
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and it will likely reproduce (sex).
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily, maybe it will just expand.  And sexuality in humans is
<br>
about far more than just reproduction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd be more amenable to an argument that violence or status could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminated from post-singularity civilization, although it seems likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me that both of those should survive it just fine.
</em><br>
<p>Status-seeking behavior in humans derives directly from &quot;sexual
<br>
selection&quot; -- trying to impress potential mates...
<br>
<p>If transhumans seek status it will be in a very different sense, i believe
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Calling it &quot;Stone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Age&quot; may make it easier to dismiss, but it doesn't alter the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are referring to are fundamental processes that *any*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence will be required to deal with.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're abstracting the 'fundamental processes' I've mentioned, to a
<br>
very high degree, in order to arrive at this conclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For game theoretic concerns to apply to a scenario there are three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criteria that must be met.  There must be a a finite supply of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources.  There must be competing agents.  Demand for resources among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents must exceed supply.  Disrupting any one of these will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient to render analysis using present tools and concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first point is non-debatable at this point.  Barring radical new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, there will always be a finite supply of energy available for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation.  If new physics emerge that allow an infinite amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy to be extracted from a finite amount of matter, well, none of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculations about anything mean anything anyway.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree completely.  There is a finite supply of air, but it doesn't
<br>
bother humans, we don't compete over air.
<br>
<p>A sufficiently large finite supply of X is essentially the same as an
<br>
infinite supply of X, for practical purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The third point, also, can be easily dismissed.  Whether there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing agents or not it is reasonable to believe that a Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will consume the maximum amount of energy feasibly possible and that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be able to consume beyond that were more to become available.
</em><br>
<p>I guess it's reasonable to believe that, but it's just as reasonable not
<br>
to...
<br>
<p>Maybe a superintelligent AI will find ways to achieve what it wants with
<br>
relatively modest energy.  Or as you say, maybe it will find new ways of
<br>
generating energy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This leaves the second point, which appears to provide the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism capable of disrupting our ability to perform analysis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (extrapolation to?) post-singularity civilization.  If there is only one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, then there can't very well be competition between agents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But without competition, game theory falls apart.  The question, then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is whether it is more likely that there will be a single super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence than multiple.
</em><br>
<p>We have no idea.  I'm guessing it will be somewhere inbetween what we think
<br>
of as &quot;single&quot; and what we think of as &quot;multiple&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems overwhelmingly likely to me that there will be multiple super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences.  For there to be only one SI requires such a fast takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time that it strongly implies that there will be no additional &quot;hard&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems in intelligence after we get just past human level.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires that there be no problems as hard as human-level AI itself, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places where the blossoming process gets stuck.  Because if it does get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuck, anywhere, there will soon be other SIs (it is easier to solve a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem once you know it has been solved somewhere else, even if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know exactly how it was solved).  As soon as there are other SIs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game theory comes back and, with it, our ability to say useful things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about possible civilizational structures in the post-singularity world.
</em><br>
<p>Even if there are many superhuman AI's at first, they may end up merging
<br>
together.
<br>
<p>I don't think game theory is very useful for analyzing complex human
<br>
situations, and I think it will also not be very useful for analyzing AI's
<br>
in the future, though perhaps for different reasons.
<br>
