<em>&gt; Iz zat so?  I'm very skeptical that it is even possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let alone wise, to *always* resist short term temptation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Strange that evolution never stumbled on endowing some

</em><br>
<p>There's an over emphasis here on short term goals and long term goals.  
<br>
It's a matter of evaluating what will happen in the future as a result 
<br>
of an action and determining which tradeoff is better.  In this example, 
<br>
the short term tradeoff is either that I get the girl and take an easy 
<br>
class or I learn something interesting and take the hard class.  Long 
<br>
term, I have a very low chance of chance of gaining a life long friend 
<br>
or a high chance of learning something which will be useful.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it's not ignoring all short term goals, but those goals 
<br>
that result from human biases.  For example, I have two books laying on 
<br>
my desk.  One is a collection of short stories by PKD and the other is 
<br>
on system software (the programs that make computers go).  How I decide 
<br>
which to read will be based on a large number of factors, but none of 
<br>
them relate to my ability to reproduce (even if improved reproductive 
<br>
fitness results, I give it a weighting of zero).

Sorry if my lines fold at strange places.  Lee pointed out to me that it 
was happening, but I can only see this in the archives:  when I write 
and read my messages to SL4 my lines fold nicely.  Seems to be something 
odd with my MUA that I still haven't tracked down.
