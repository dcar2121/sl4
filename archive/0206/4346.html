<p>Fair enough.  I should have been more clear.  When asking a large enough 
<br>
audience about a topic such as designed Friendliness, where we have no 
<br>
experience, we can expect people to disagree.  We can't absolutely reject a 
<br>
plan just because someone disagrees, they have to have a valid (checkable) 
<br>
reason for disagreeing.
<br>
<p>When you say &quot;A 10% risk of extinction...&quot;, are you talking about a 
<br>
confidence level (aka '&quot;I'm I feel about 90% sure that we'll come out of 
<br>
this alive.&quot;), or are you suggesting that we'll have some way to measure 
<br>
the true risk level.  If it's the latter, I'd love to hear some suggestions 
<br>
on how we could accurately predict the percent risk a given Seed AI poses.
<br>
<p>finally:
<br>
I agree that we must maximize our confidence in the Friendliness affinity 
<br>
of any proposed Seed AI.
<br>
We can then confidently move forward once we reach the point where the risk 
<br>
of extinction due to execution of Seed AI equals the risk of extinction due 
<br>
to not acting.  (My own opinion is that the risk of extinction by not 
<br>
acting is on the rise, so we'll probably see the crossover happen at 
<br>
something &gt; 1%, possibly as high as 5%.)
