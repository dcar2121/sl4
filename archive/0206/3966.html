<p>Unless I'm completely mistaken, though, most theorists did not think

that the few remaining problems would turn out to be what they have

become.  They knew that there were a few unanswered questions, but 
<br>
because of recent advances they expected they would tackle these 
<br>
questions like many of the rest.
<br>
<p>At any rate, my main point is physics has a history of situations where 
<br>
it looked like the end of theoretical physics was near and there'd be an 
<br>
explanation for everything when it turned out that a `trivial' question 
<br>
was a lot more complex than expected.
