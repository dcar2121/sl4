</em><br>
<p>Of course you realize that the trend in growth of past estimates done by
<br>
people with otherwise impeccable accomplishment track speaks against your
<br>
statement. Granted, though smart people, they had no idea of modern
<br>
neuroscience. We might be not as smart, but we have several decades worth
<br>
of literature more to study.
<br>
<p>If you track the neuroscience publications more or less closely you'll
<br>
find little basis for optimism there. It's not just the complexity which
<br>
makes accurate numerical models of wet systems a stark nightmare, it's the
<br>
number of bells and whistles, and how much of systems intrinsic artifacts
<br>
are being hijacked for implementing features.
<br>
<p>The trend does not look good here.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; #1.  The human brain uses a lot of it's neurons for autonomic bodily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintenance functions like blood pressure, heart rate, endocrine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system control, balance and locomotion, motor control of speech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many others that we don't generally associate with higher level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning tasks and would certainly not assist in solving the protein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; folding problem or design of a nano assembler.
</em><br>
<p>That what the rest of the CNS is there for. Your brain is generally not
<br>
concerned with low level functions. If you want to include low level 
<br>
homeostasis, please factor in the neurons in the entire body.
<br>
<p>Conversely, since human equivalent intelligence needs to be embodied, or
<br>
contain representational systems of the outside world to be able to seize
<br>
control of actuators about the same fraction of computational resources
<br>
are required.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; #2.  The human brain is very physically robust in a dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment with delicate components, by using massive neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redundancy.  Redundant neurons are rewired around damaged areas to
</em><br>
<p>Redundancy is not the word. I would term this as graceful degradation and 
<br>
adaptive remapping. Pretty small localized lesions can knock out complete 
<br>
functionalities. If you think you can randomly destroy every second or 
<br>
even every third neuron in your brain and not notice anything out of 
<br>
ordinary you're kidding yourself.
<br>
<p>Structure shrinkage in circuitry will soon force us to use similiar
<br>
techniques to be able to fabricate and operate systems with &gt;&gt;10^9
<br>
components. Molecular circuitry won't be possible without this. The
<br>
fabbing defect density and the failure rate is brutal with molecular
<br>
components.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; recover functions lost in strokes or other trauma.  You can lose half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your brain with only a slight reduction in effective IQ according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscientists.
</em><br>
<p>I guess that says something about the relevance of IQ. If you think you
<br>
can lose a hemisphere and not show cognitive and motoric deficits, you
<br>
should put down that glass pipe.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; #3.  The computational methodologies resulting from evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional adaptations are very inefficient and subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization by intelligent design.
</em><br>
<p>Calling evolutionary algorithms inefficient is neat. Inefficient in
<br>
relation to what? Intelligent design, huh? 
<br>
<p>Intelligent design is a) has been invented by evolutionary algorithms
<br>
starting with the prebiotic ursoup, a pretty harsh handicap b) a number of
<br>
plausible hypotheses explain intelligent action as darwinian selection on
<br>
a population of noise-driven planners (&lt;<a href="http://williamcalvin.com/">http://williamcalvin.com/</a>&gt;) c) in
<br>
a number of narrowly defined areas evolutionary algorithms on today's
<br>
hardware outperform humans in design tasks. Koza's stuff is pretty weak,
<br>
but he's got a few patents done by a machine.
<br>
<p>Latter doesn't mean humans are such hotshots design-wise, but it clearly
<br>
means noise-driven stochastic algorithms don't have clear limitations, and
<br>
achieve human-level performance in specific tasks under very adverse
<br>
conditions (lousy algorithms, lousy hardware, lousy population size). I
<br>
think we'll be rather impressed with what mature evolutionary algorithms
<br>
on large scale molecular hardware can achieve.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; #4.  Estimates of the number of neurons times the maximum firing rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get the computational capacity are highly inflated due to the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that at any given moment not all the neurons are doing productive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.  If all the neurons were firing at their maximum rate you would
</em><br>
<p>Estimates based on average firing rate are complete hogwash, because they 
<br>
completely ignore other forms of processing, other sites of processing, 
<br>
and completely ignore timing info.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; have something like super epilepsy.  Many neural circuits are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialized for a function and are idling if the function isn't being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presently called.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #5.  The human brain as a technological problem solving device is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously screwed up.  Many of the supposedly &quot;productive functions&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are actually counter productive and it is a miracle that any useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem solving gets done at all.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's all we've got for now. (I don't see how this gives you a bound 
<br>
on crunch, or design constraints, or anything).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, I estimate, that the $1000 desk top of 2002 is not more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than three doublings away from human level complex problem solving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general deliberative software implementation capability.
</em><br>
<p>You're still confusing crunch (measured in what? remember memory
<br>
bandwidth) with a generally intelligent system.  You'll observe that a kg
<br>
of neuron suspension in liquid culture is usually not very intelligent.
<br>
<p>Even if we assume you're not wildly overoptimistic, you're completely 
<br>
ignoring the bootstrap issue. It may require a lot of crunch to be able to 
<br>
do neat stuff with a modest amount of crunch.
