<p>Gee, forgot about the Clipper Chip already have we?  Very

<p>Yes, to some degree this is happening very slowly.  But we would have to 
<br>
see a significant increase in adoption of your viewpoint and related 
<br>
technology and see groups such as the EFF, ACLU, etc. shrink and eventually 
<br>
disappear.  This would almost certainly take decades, if it were allowed to 
<br>
happen at all.  Personally, I believe there is a threshold beyond which 
<br>
most Americans would demand change if things went in this direction.
