<p>Not that strange, since thinking in terms of long term goals requires a

comparatively sophisticated mind, and that's hard enough to evolve as it

is.

brainware (which may in some cases justify yielding to a short term
<br>
temptation if that is expected to pay off in increased productivity, of

course).

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; (For the latter point, recall those people who claim not

</em><br>
<p>Your conclusion seems to be based on the unmentioned assumption
<br>
that the value system of a person should necessarily revolve around ver
<br>
current identity, stable or not. For example, consider a value system
<br>
where one's current self is not inherently more valuable than the
<br>
possible future entities calling themselves by the same name, or than a
<br>
random entity of the same complexity level at this time or the future.
<br>
Thus it is entirely rational to sacrifice one's wellbeing if it is
<br>
expected that a being with another identity, be it in some sense the
<br>
continuation of the same being or not, will benefit in a greater amount.
<br>
<p>Personally I do tend to view my identity as transitory, and hold a
<br>
conscious value system based on the ideas outlined above. (My
<br>
subconscious value system tends to have some small gripes about that,
<br>
though, manifesting mostly as purported subgoals of the above - ie. &quot;you
<br>
need to have some fun now if you're going to get anything reasonably
<br>
sane done today/this week/ever&quot;. Luckily my suboptimal and partly
<br>
irrational mental architecture isn't the issue here.)
