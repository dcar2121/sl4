<p>ADVISORY BOARD, MY LEFT FOOT.
<br>
<p>I understand that you later, in addition to the suggestion above, floated a 
<br>
modified suggestion for an advisory board.  Just to be absolutely clear, I 
<br>
am panicking over the suggestion above and not the suggestion of an advisory 
<br>
board.  SIAI has already considered creating an advisory board.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; My interest is *not* in convincing people that solutions will work.  I
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; want a solution that *does work*.  I suppose, as a secondary goal, that
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; I want people to know the truth, but that is not primary; solving the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; problem is primary.  It is not supposed to be persuasive, it is
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; supposed to ACTUALLY WORK.  Lose sight of that and game over.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Yes, but have you actually considered the idea that you could be wrong?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; That YOUR ideas may not work?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, for the love of -
<br>
<p>Would I have spent O(N^2) hours working out a goal system architecture that 
<br>
lets an AI sanely spot and fix architectural errors in its own goal system 
<br>
if I thought I was infallible?
<br>
<p>Now ask me whether I think your &quot;not a committee, just 10 bickering people 
<br>
with individual veto power over the Singularity&quot; idea is going to work.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Have you considered what would happen if
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this were the case?  As they say, two heads are better than one (which,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; btw, I very much agree with).  So having a few different people all
</em><br>
<em> &gt; working on the Friendliness problem would be highly beneficial.  If for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; no other reason than it would give all of them alternate ideas to look at
</em><br>
<em> &gt;  and think about, which may then improve their own designs.
</em><br>
<p>CFAI is on the Web.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; I know a *lot* of AI morality concepts that sound appealing but are
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; utterly unworkable.  For that reason, above all else, I am scared to
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; death of committees.  It seems very predictable what the result will be
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;  and it will be absolutely deadly.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Would you please get off the committee thing.  Your sounding like a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; broken record because you just keep repeating the same point, over and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; over.  Advisory board, not committee (I should NEVER have called it such
</em><br>
<em> &gt; - my bad).  Everyone can always use some good advice.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, if the resolution of this is that you call for the creation of the 
<br>
advisory board and the earlier committee concept gets sunk, buried, and 
<br>
burned, then I'd accept that as a temporary &quot;win&quot; for the good guys.  Not 
<br>
that the notion isn't going to shamble forth from its grave and have to be 
<br>
defeated again every six months.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Its seems to be inherently difficult to convince you that your not god
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and shouldn't personally be making all the decisions that will
</em><br>
<em> &gt; permanently seal the fate of the human race.
</em><br>
<p>If I thought that I'd be advocating the idea of SIAI having veto power over 
<br>
all AI projects, on the basis of our greater expertise, dedication, 
<br>
altruism, and understanding of the Singularity.  *NOBODY* should have that 
<br>
power.  Not me, not your committee, not anyone.  Once we start fighting over 
<br>
who gets to give orders instead of working out the best engineering 
<br>
solution, the main issue has been lost.
<br>
<p>No, I'm not God.  Why would your ten people with veto power be God?  What 
<br>
exactly has been gained here?  Maybe you need to stew over the problem and 
<br>
let it slowly drive you insane for a few weeks, rather than picking on the 
<br>
first solution that comes to mind.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;&gt; Here's an idea:  Instead of convening the Committee to Fuck Up Friendly
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt;  AI, let's convene the Committee to Decide Whether the CFUFAI Should
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; Exist in the First Place, with a clear understanding that the members
</em><br>
<em> &gt;&gt; of CDWCSEFP will probably *not* serve on CFUFAI.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Huh?
</em><br>
<p>Calling a committee to solve a problem presumes that a committee is the best 
<br>
way to solve the problem.  Wouldn't it be more logical to first convene a 
<br>
committee to decide whether a committee is the best way of making the decision?
