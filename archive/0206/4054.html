(A Review of Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;the good of the many outweighs the good of the few,
<br>
or the one&quot; 
<br>
<p>It may be dramatic cinema buts it is sickening
<br>
philosophy, especially from a character supposedly
<br>
driven by rationality. It befits the political climate
<br>
of majority rules, of expediency as guide, of
<br>
anti-Americanism and anto-individiualism*. If you have
<br>
read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand you would have
<br>
observed how those in power used the good reputation
<br>
of the nation's premier scientist to deceive the
<br>
people into accepting an evil government weapon of
<br>
suppression, and noted the scientist's sanction of
<br>
this deception. In the film the anti-philosophy of mob
<br>
rule is slipped in between some of the character
<br>
Spock's finest moments, a character admired by many.
<br>
Was this deliberate? Probably not, but the effect is
<br>
as if it was. 
<br>
<p>At the end, when Spock asks why he went to such
<br>
lengths Kirk smiles and reverses Spock's earlier
<br>
quotation; 
<br>
<p>&quot;The good of the one outweighed the good of the many.&quot;
<br>
Spock, perhaps cleansed by his bizarre regeneration,
<br>
appears to understand. 
<br>
<p>In his refusal to sacrifice himself or his values for
<br>
the sake of another (in this case the government's
<br>
notion of good) the character of Kirk has its moment
<br>
as a true American hero. You could almost hear him
<br>
saying &quot;the public good be damned!&quot;
