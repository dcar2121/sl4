Samantha, what I'm worried about is that Kurzweil seems to be spreading a
<br>
mutant nonactivist form of the meme.  Vernor Vinge's original stories of the 
<br>
Singularity were based around the blazing disruptive power of 
<br>
smarter-than-human intelligence, not the inexorable grinding of the wheels 
<br>
of industry churning out transhumanity as a safe, ordinary luxury. 
<br>
Therefore Vinge's stories often show, realistically, individuals or projects 
<br>
that play a critical role in the final Singularity (regardless of how much 
<br>
background technological progress contributes to it).  Vernor Vinge's 1993 
<br>
NASA lecture emphasizes both the speed of the changes once created and the 
<br>
size of the stakes - and while we're at it, also emphasizes the need to 
<br>
enter the Singularity with our best foot forward, the possible differences 
<br>
between technologies, and the fact that the intrinsic rate of some 
<br>
technologies may be faster than others.  At this moment Kurzweil's version 
<br>
of the Singularity meme doesn't include *any* of Vinge's strategic, activist 
<br>
thinking, except in the very diluted form of deciding which inevitability to 
<br>
predict.
<br>
<p>Vinge and I have very different approaches toward how our lives can matter 
<br>
in humanity's sweep toward the Singularity, but structurally our thinking is 
<br>
similar enough that I have no worries about the memes he spreads.  If Vinge 
<br>
should make what I regard as a strategic error, I don't expect it will be 
<br>
any problem to point it out from within Vinge's framework.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil gave a presentation at Extro 5.  During the Q&amp;A session, I got up 
<br>
and said (if I recall correctly, that is; the video is on Kurzweil's site): 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, you've told us to expect a Singularity, but you haven't told us 
<br>
whether it's good or bad, or what we should be doing about it.  What are our 
<br>
marching orders?&quot;  Kurzweil stood stock still for around 7 seconds until 
<br>
some still-unforgiven voice from the audience gave him an out by asking 
<br>
&quot;Well, what do you mean by the Singularity?&quot;, and Kurzweil took it.  Ben 
<br>
Goertzel, after Kurzweil's presentation, said:  &quot;I don't think we should get 
<br>
so caught up in predicting that nanotechnological immune systems will exist 
<br>
that we forget to actually develop the immune systems,&quot; and got a round of 
<br>
applause from the audience - because there was no hint of that in Kurzweil's 
<br>
presentation.  At the Foresight Gathering, I asked &quot;Have you considered 
<br>
whether we could accelerate the Singularity?&quot; and Kurzweil said, in an 
<br>
incredulous tone, &quot;How could anyone possibly accelerate the Singularity?&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't read this as Kurzweil having considered the possibility of activism 
<br>
and rejected it because he can't think of anything good.  I read it as 
<br>
&quot;activism&quot; structurally conflicting with Kurzweil's thinking about the 
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>This causes me to worry about Kurzweil being the Singularity spokesperson in 
<br>
a way that I would not worry about for Vinge.  I am sure that Kurzweil has 
<br>
done enormously more in the way of concrete technological development than 
<br>
Vinge.  But Vinge has an activist outlook on the Singularity.  Kurzweil is 
<br>
speaking from within a view which does not structurally permit activism.  I 
<br>
am worried about this view being transmitted to Kurzweil's audience.
