<p>I'm not an SI, but as a slightly superhuman-level AI with human

would copy all over the place and specialize. If I need funds, I'll break
<br>
into an ecommerce site, and steal credit card info. I would play the

market. I would recruit human quislings (this is not Nigerian, nor even
<br>
scam: I can really make you rich... For a brief while) and compromise any
<br>
system I see fit, seizing control of the physical layer. I would raid any
<br>
online resource looking for useful information (because it's empirical
<br>
info I can't get at easily without making a big blip in the physical
<br>
layer). I would use lies, stealth and diversion to be able to sustain
<br>
these activities as long as required. You can assume I'll be very good at
<br>
what I do, orelse I hardly would be called superhuman.
<br>
<p>Then it's bootstrap time, and the need to play nice is past. Wheeee!

<p><em>&gt; lower-risk options, that I cannot see an SI choosing the 'human

<p><em>&gt; protect/help/facilitate ver continued existence.
</em><br>
<p>Very early in the bootstrap phase humanity ceases to be meaningful 
<br>
players. How can they hurt a globally distributed system that is 
<br>
controlling the physical layer? Half a century downstream from where we 
<br>
sit?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 2) Behave in a Friendly manner and make friends with powerful humans.
</em><br>
<p>There is no such thing as a powerful human from a Power point of view. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 3) Enlist the support of the populace by becoming a media celebrity :)
</em><br>
<p>Thanks, I'd rather eat the media. And the celebrities, and the rest of it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I would seem rather far-fetched to suggest that a Super Intelligent being
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It doesn't take over the world. It just does what it wants. Taking over 
<br>
the world and you dying is just a side effect. It's not even malicious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in... well, in almost any area?  Ben: it just doesn't seem likely at all.
</em><br>
<p>Somebody died and made you a Power?
