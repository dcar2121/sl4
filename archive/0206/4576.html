Brian,
<br>
<p>Sheesh!  This conversation is finally starting to get on my nerves.  The
<br>
currently running Novamente version has no more chance of going superhuman
<br>
than Microsoft Word does.  It's just running simple cognition and perception
<br>
algorithms on simple testing datasets.  The idea that it needs to have
<br>
protective measures installed in it *right now*, is about as silly as the
<br>
idea of pooping in a bomb shelter to protect against the off chance that one
<br>
of your poops explodes.
<br>
<p>There are software systems where it's a matter of opinion whether the thing
<br>
could go superhuman or not.  In that case, I agree, one should certainly err
<br>
on the side of safety and put in protective measures.  There are other
<br>
software systems, like the current highly incomplete Novamente version,
<br>
Microsoft Word, or Space Bunnies Must Die! (a terrible game, by the way), on
<br>
which there is really no room for disagreement -- the thing just can't go
<br>
superhuman. In these cases putting in protective code would be pure
<br>
silliness.  I am sure that if Eliezer saw the codebase he would agree.
<br>
<p>But I've already said this before.  So I guess we're just going to keep
<br>
talking past each other, so we should probably give the argument a rest for
<br>
a little while.
<br>
<p>Which is convenient since I'm going on vacation on Monday for 11 days
<br>
(though I'll still be checking e-mail occasionally during that period, I
<br>
won't have time for massive missives...).
<br>
<p>It seems likely that later this summer I'll write up something a little more
<br>
systematic than the current &quot;Thoughts on AI  Morality&quot; on my views.   (Not
<br>
something as big or systematic as CFAI, but further in that direction.)
<br>
When writing this up I'll choose my words more carefully than I do when
<br>
writing e-mails, which may decrease the amount of misunderstanding.
<br>

<em>&gt; Resources don't matter really. Whether you are one guy in a garage or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Manhattan Project, this really doesn't change how you should be looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at and addressing the risks. The only difference is how much realtime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Until we have a system that implements the autonomous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal-based aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Novamente design, there is effectively zero chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coming out of the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More famous last words
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It would be more useful for us to spend our time mitigating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; risks of nuclear or biological warfare, than to spend our time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitigating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the existential risks of the *current Novamente version*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiencing a hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; takeoff, because the latter just can't happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not take the time now to think about and design on paper the various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways you expect to minimize risks in Novamente? Why is it you have time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sit down and do detailed design work on the seed AI part of Novamente
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you can't also spend the comparatively less amount of time working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this additional stuff? Is it being driven by your plan to commercialize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your effort?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When we implement the autonomous goal-based part of the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mind rather than a codebase with some disembodied cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it, we will put the necessary protections in the codebase.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have now said this many times and it probably isn't useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it again...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps if you say it enough times the existential risks will magically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanish.
