Pascal's wager, you'll recall, goes roughly like this. 1. If there is a God
<br>
and you are a believer, then up you go up to heaven. (Best outcome).  2. If
<br>
there is no God and you are a believer then little lost.  3. If there is no
<br>
God and you are not a believer then little is gained. 4. If there is a God
<br>
and you don't believe then down you go to hell to eat flaming shit. (Worst
<br>
outcome).

It

E.Y. thinks Friendliness first, B. G. thinks AGI first. Who is right?
<br>
Suppose we don't know. How should we act? Well either attempting to design
<br>
for Friendliness before AGI will be effective in raising the probability of
<br>
a good singularity or it will not. From best to worst are as follows:
<br>
<p>1. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should come first and it is true
<br>
that Friendliness should come first. (Best outcome).
<br>
2. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should come first and it is false
<br>
that Friendliness should come first. (Slightly negative).
<br>
3. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should not come first and it is
<br>
false that Friendliness should come first. (Slightly positive outcome).
<br>
4. We believe (and act as if) Friendliness should not come first and it is
<br>
true that Friendliness should come first. (Worst outcome).
<br>
<p>1 is best because we have effectively raised the probability of a good
<br>
singularity. Of course we should not make light of 2 and 3. If it takes X
<br>
years to figure out Friendliness and it is inefficient to focus on it now
<br>
(as B.G. maintains) then a lot of time (= a lot of lives) could be wasted.
<br>
With 4 at best we squander our opportunity to raise the probability of a
<br>
good singularity, at worst we are responsible for a bad singularity
<br>
(unforeseen hard tack off). Thus,  given our uncertainty and what is at
<br>
stake I think we should act as if Friendliness should come first.
