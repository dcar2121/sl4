</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is an irrational decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that this is a matter of prioritizing short-term goals over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-term goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To do so is not intrinsically irrational.  What is irrational is *believing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one is acting optimally toward one's long-term goals*, whereas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *actually* one is choosing one's actions toward one's short-term goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e., fooling oneself, by ignoring evidence
</em><br>
<p>Let us by all means be precise...
<br>
<p>Here's the chain of causality as I see it.  Someone has short-term goals and
<br>
long-term goals which conflict.  Let's say we have two fellows, one of whom
<br>
is more rational than the other.  Both fellows, if they are not Zen masters,
<br>
will be attracted by the immediate short-term temptation, will see the
<br>
negative long-term consequences, and will feel cognitive dissonance as a
<br>
result; there is a sense of entitlement to the temptation and it would
<br>
require an expenditure of mental energy to refuse it.  The difference
<br>
between the more rational and the less rational fellow is that the less
<br>
rational fellow may reduce cognitive dissonance by rationalizing away the
<br>
long-term consequences or rationalizing long-term support for the short-term
<br>
temptation.  This path is less open to the more rational of the pair.
<br>
<p>Cultural stereotypes are formed by observing departures from what is
<br>
believed to be the cultural norm.  In this case more rational people, as a
<br>
result of structural differences in the thought process, emergently tend to
<br>
attend to long-term goals more than less rational people.  This emergent
<br>
result is also reinforced by the abstract nature of long-term goals and the
<br>
concrete nature of short-term temptations; an ability to attend to abstract
<br>
thoughts equally with concrete thoughts is a talent that supports
<br>
rationality and is therefore correlated with it.
<br>
<p>The resultant cultural stereotype, however, is based on surface
<br>
differences.  It is supposed that &quot;rationality&quot; means being *biased toward*
<br>
long-term goals over short-term goals.  I call this kind of stereotype
<br>
&quot;macho rationality&quot;.  Stereotypes of this kind are common in the cultural
<br>
perception of rationality, altruism, perfectionism, iconoclasm, and so on;
<br>
structural clarity which rules out a human-normal bias is seen as a bias in
<br>
the opposite direction.  Similarly, rationality is often misinterpreted as a
<br>
bias toward discomforting beliefs - &quot;macho rationality&quot; again - where
<br>
rationality consists simply of focusing on truths whether they are
<br>
comforting or discomforting; a form of structural clarity which contradicts
<br>
the human-normal bias in favor of comforting beliefs, but does not consist
<br>
of a bias in the opposite direction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A great many scientific theories begin by someone starting with a theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'd like to be true, and coming up with reasons why it might be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is abduction, in essence.
</em><br>
<p>Abduction is observing something which is true, then increasing the support
<br>
of those hypotheses which are compatible with the observation.  This form of
<br>
cognition is similar to &quot;rationalization&quot;; and rationalization can
<br>
manipulate slack in hypotheses to change their predictions post facto; which
<br>
is why science requires prediction *before* the fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are championing deductive inference, which is just one among several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modes of inference.  (And when probabilistic evidence is involved, deduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not *absolutely* certain either, although it tends to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater-confidence conclusiosn than induction or abduction.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that rationalization is, specifically, a *control mechanism for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference* that *specifically seeks to consider only evidence in favor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth of a certain proposition, rather than evidence against its truth.*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not specifically tied to abduction, deduction, or any specific mode of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning, in my view.  One can rationalize with pure deduction if one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wishes.
</em><br>
<p>If you use hypothetical abductive reasoning to assemble evidence then you
<br>
should use it equably to assemble both negative evidence and positive
<br>
evidence.  This is in fact roughly equivalent to deductive reasoning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I think that *rationalization itself* is a powerful heuristic for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative thought.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  I think that if you have a population of a thousand human
<br>
scientists, then most of them will be rationalizing humans.  Some of them
<br>
will, by pure chance, rationalize ideas that happen to be correct, and their
<br>
rationalizing abductive processes may therefore, by coincidence, arrive at
<br>
correct conclusions.  But this requires a large population of scientists. 
<br>
Most of the rationalizers will drop out of the process because their
<br>
rationalized conclusions will be wrong, unless a great many scientists
<br>
rationalize the same conclusions simultaneously, in which case the whole
<br>
field goes down the wrong road.  When you are using abduction properly you
<br>
are simultaneously trying to assemble supporting evidence and negative
<br>
evidence, unprejudiced.  I do not think that trying to assemble only
<br>
supporting evidence leads to any greater intelligence.  It may sometimes,
<br>
unintentionally, lead to science as a whole taking larger steps through the
<br>
fitness landscape - if the population of rationalizing scientists is
<br>
sufficiently large and sufficiently diverse.
<br>
<p>If, historically, many scientists arrived at correct conclusions through
<br>
rationalization, this does not show that rationalization is a good strategy
<br>
for increasing individual intelligence.  It shows that rationalization in a
<br>
population of scientists and the subpopulation of scientific iconoclasts can
<br>
sometimes approximate intelligence, given the scientific weeding process. 
<br>
If rationalizing scientific discoverers outnumber rational scientific
<br>
discoverers, which has by no means been demonstrated to be the case, this
<br>
still would not in itself show anything about the native effectiveness of
<br>
rationality versus rationalization; it might just be that there are many
<br>
more rationalizers than rationalists.  The proportion of effective
<br>
rationalists and effective rationalizers in scientific history will be a
<br>
product of the a priori proportion of rationalists to rationalizers in the
<br>
scientific population, not just the proportion of effective rationalists to
<br>
rationalists and the proportion of effective rationalizers to rationalizers.
<br>
<p>&quot;Historically, some scientists have rationalized correct conclusions.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/-&gt;
<br>
&quot;I can arrive at better conclusions by increasing rationalization.&quot;
<br>
<p>Although of course, if you *want* to rationalize, &quot;Some historical
<br>
scientists have rationalized correct conclusions&quot; makes a wonderful
<br>
rationalization for that philosophy...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, really great creative thinkers may proceed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) rationalizing their way to an interesting conclusion, by careful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) then, AFTERWARDS, considering their conclusion in a more balanced way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at both positive and negative evidence equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, I think that rationalization is an important part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative thought process, but it is dangerous if used alone, rather than as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one stage in a multi-stage process
</em><br>
<p>I have found that, despite all common wisdom, the most critical part of
<br>
being really creative lies in narrowing down inventiveness to correct ideas,
<br>
not in &quot;brainstorming&quot;.  I don't need brainstorming.  I'm inventive enough
<br>
already.  What's needed is inventiveness that hits correct targets and comes
<br>
up with ideas that are *really* true and not just ideas that *sound* true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; When you are trying to find a reason why your conclusion is true, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being to feel like you are straining to come up with support.  Stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right there.  If you don't know, you don't know, so don't make something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up, because whatever you make up is not helpful and will confuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matters, an irrational choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, making stuff up is great.  The important thing is to,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards, judge what you've made up by a harsher criterion (a fuller
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration of evidence).
</em><br>
<p>I think that excellence in creativity is only achieved when you no longer
<br>
need to make stuff up.  I think that while you're in the &quot;making stuff up&quot;
<br>
stage you occasionally hit the target, but you miss it just as often, and
<br>
that's not good enough.  When you're in the &quot;making stuff up&quot; stage you have
<br>
your raw intuitions plus occasionally correct abductive hypotheses for those
<br>
intuitions of yours that happen to be correct; &quot;making stuff up&quot; contributes
<br>
occasionally correct rational support for those intuitions that happened to
<br>
be correct to begin with, but it doesn't let you refine your intuitions so
<br>
that they become more powerful.  If you direct more skepticism at your
<br>
rationalized reasons then you may be able to spot some incorrect intuitions
<br>
because of the strained nature of their rationalized support, but this is
<br>
not actually rationality; this is a kind of irrational thinking arranged so
<br>
that some of the irrationalities cancel out.
<br>
<p>Real rationality is very, very rare.
