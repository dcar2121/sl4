<em>&gt; You and Eliezer seem to assume that as soon as a system has an

</em><br>
<em>&gt; takeoff risk.  As if, say, a &quot;digital dog&quot; is going to solve the hard

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sourcecode!
</em><br>
<p>No, we think that it is worthwhile to prevent trivial existential risks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we have confidence about different things.  You and Eli seem to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more optimism than me that simple hard-takeoff-prevention mechanisms will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.
</em><br>
<p>No, we think that any simple mechanism that has a chance of working 
<br>
should be implemented.  Not a certainty, a chance.  You don't *need* a 
<br>
certainty for the mechanism to be a good idea.  All you need is a 
<br>
*chance*.  If there's a *chance* it will work, then you should do it. 
<br>
If you have a small chance of preventing a small chance of a very large 
<br>
disaster, then take it.  It doesn't have to be a large chance of 
<br>
preventing a small chance of a very large disaster for us to think it's 
<br>
worthwhile.  small * small * very large == worth doing
<br>
<p><em> &gt; And I seem to have more confidence than you that there will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of infrahuman AGI in which the risk of hard takeoff is very very very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very low, in which all sorts of things to do with computer consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard takeoff prevention, intelligence measurement and AGI in general can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studied.
</em><br>
<p>Ben, I also think that there's a period of infrahuman AGI in which the 
<br>
chance of hard takeoff is very very very very low, and in fact, as you 
<br>
recall, I don't think the Novamente described in your manuscript will be 
<br>
capable of doing a hard takeoff, ever.  That's what I *think*.  There 
<br>
are always surprises.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that you guys don't really accept the diversity of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical systems.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that we are thinking about ethics in fundamentally 
<br>
different ways.  The diversity of human ethical systems is simply not 
<br>
relevant to what I am saying, and the fact that you keep bringing it up 
<br>
shows that I am not getting across.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not possible to teach Novababy a &quot;universal human morality or ethics&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because no such thing exists.
</em><br>
<p>It is not your job or mine to produce such an ethics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I understand the need to temper my natural entrepreneurial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk-taking streak in these matters, I think your criticism is a bit too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong here.  You need to understand that my estimate of the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential risk of Novamente having a hard takeoff is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitesimally small.
</em><br>
<p>So is mine.  But I don't know what surprises are embedded in the space 
<br>
of self-modifying algorithms, and we have fundamentally different 
<br>
pictures of how a hard takeoff works.  I don't know how the dominoes are 
<br>
spaced and I don't know which domino knocks over all the other dominoes. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One innocent-looking algorithm might produce an algorithm that 
<br>
produced an algorithm that produced an algorithm et cetera.  You would 
<br>
need a map of the entire fitness landscape to actually *know* that a 
<br>
hard takeoff wouldn't happen.  I am not saying that Novamente might 
<br>
knock over much bigger dominoes than you think; I am saying that the 
<br>
dominoes might unexpectedly turn out to be all lined up.  Just because I 
<br>
visualize an actual hard takeoff as occurring when an AI learns to 
<br>
solve, using general intelligence, the problem of designing cognitive 
<br>
systems and implementing code for it, does not mean that all hard 
<br>
takeoffs are constrained to occur in this way.
