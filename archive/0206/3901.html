<p>
SL4,
<br>
<p>I have been thinking about, worrying about actually, the process of
<br>
uploading, and how it will be handled by society, and particularly by
<br>
individuals.   While I do not have the story-telling flare of some of the
<br>
other list members, I nevertheless wish to share with you some of my
<br>
concerns, and possible solutions.
<br>
<p>To Move or to Copy?  That is the question.
<br>
------------------------------------------
<br>
When deciding whether to upload there will be many things to consider.  One
<br>
of the most difficult choices will be whether to Copy your mind to the new
<br>
substrate, leaving your human body still alive and fully operational, or to
<br>
Move your mind, killing your original body &amp; brain.
<br>
<p>After considering this 'binary' decision for a while, it occurred to me that
<br>
it doesn't have to be as clear-cut as I have heretofore imagined.  There are
<br>
several possible partial combinations that an individual might want to
<br>
implement.  For example:
<br>
<p>You could start by creating a Copy of your mind, leaving you Original fully
<br>
operational, but keeping open a high-bandwidth communications channel
<br>
between your two mental instantiations.  This would enable a wide variety of
<br>
points-of-view to be experienced by both mind parts.  From the Copy's POV
<br>
there would be a ready-made, highly optimized set of sensory modalities
<br>
(SMs) available.  From the Original's POV there would be a millionfold
<br>
speedup of complex thinking/searching/querying capabilities available.  It
<br>
would provide an intimate communications mechanism between two mind parts,
<br>
something that could lead to novel insights and high creativity.  Indeed, I
<br>
imagine that the two minds would  not be separate and independent, like two
<br>
regular humans, but would be two aspects of the same mind with multiple
<br>
POVs.  With the aid of MNT it might even be possible for the Copy+Original
<br>
combo to alter the programming of, not only the Copy, but also the Original.
<br>
Just how smart could a human brain get with a properly altered program?  I'm
<br>
guessing *way* smarter than I am now :D
<br>
<p>That Queasy Feeling
<br>
-------------------
<br>
Many who consider the idea of uploading (including myself) are worried that
<br>
the uploaded environment won't be familiar enough, won't be rich enough (at
<br>
first), and will be disconnected from physical reality.  By having an
<br>
Original and a Copy tightly joined, these issues are quite neatly addressed.
<br>
The Original would have access to the new SMs via the Copy, and the Copy
<br>
would have access to the standard human SMs via the Original.  If the
<br>
cyber-reality got too crazy, ve could temporarily retreat to the familiar
<br>
world of the Original.  If the physical reality of the Original got too
<br>
boring (or painful :/) then ve could step out into the cyber-reality of the
<br>
Copy.  This arrangement might also relieve the fear of death from the
<br>
Original.  If ve could migrate ver POV to the cyber-reality of the Copy by
<br>
an act of will at any time... then death would merely be the loss of the
<br>
Original physical human body... a body that could (very likely) be
<br>
reconstructed from scratch if desired.  I know that I would personally feel
<br>
more comfortable with the idea that I could migrate back and forth between
<br>
Original and Copy 'on demand' - at least at first - when both the new
<br>
cyber-environments and the original worlds are likely to be in intense flux.
<br>
<p>The Borg Thing
<br>
--------------
<br>
The above Copy+Original idea may appear to be quite like the Star-Trek-Borg
<br>
(STB) at first glance, but there are certain important differences to note.
<br>
Firstly, the STB was a collective whereas Copy+Original is an individual.
<br>
Secondly, the televised STB was made overtly mechanical and visually
<br>
revolting for theatrical effect.  There is no reason why an Original+Copy
<br>
combination shouldn't look just like an unenhanced Original.
<br>
<p>Relevance to SL4?
<br>
-----------------
<br>
If the above discussion isn't SL4-shocking enough for you, then consider my
<br>
POV.  I am contemplating the coding of, then the education of Seed AI.  And
<br>
I want to be 100% certain that it shares my concerns for my future... and as
<br>
a huge beneficial 'side-effect' :) everyone else's concerns for their own
<br>
futures as well.  To 99.999...% of people on this planet: uploading is going
<br>
to appear 'soil-your-pants' scary.  I want to do everything in my power to
<br>
make it appear less scary, without violating the volition of anyone.  One
<br>
way to do this is to provide half-way options, reversible options.  A
<br>
scenario I like is for the SuperIntelligence (having matured to a high level
<br>
of capability) to manufacture a 'Starter Package' for the Copy+Original
<br>
option and make it look just like a bicycle helmet.  We could sell them, or
<br>
give them away... whichever turns out to be least socially disruptive.
<br>
People could try-out being an 'upload' for a while... if they liked it, then
<br>
they could make it permanent, at any time, by an act of will, while wearing
<br>
the helmet.
<br>
<p>Why am I even discussing this at such an early stage?  Well.. when SI is
<br>
created, I think it will change the world (relatively) fast... so thinking
<br>
the logistics through ahead of time will help us avoid making errors that
<br>
might cause pain to the many (billions!) who won't be expecting the coming
<br>
opportunities.  I want uploading to be a voluntary, peaceful and orderly
<br>
migration... NOT a cataclysm.
