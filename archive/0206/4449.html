<em>&gt; To summarize the summary, the main danger to Friendliness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the commanders might want a docile tool and therefore cripple moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development.  As far as I can tell, there's no inherent danger to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness in an AI going into combat, like it or not.
</em><br>
<p>In my view, the main danger to Friendliness of military AI is that the AI
<br>
may get used to the idea that killing people for the right cause is not such
<br>
a bad thing...
<br>
<p>Your arguments for why Friendliness is consistent with military AI are based
<br>
on your theory of a Friendly goal system as a fully logical, rational thing.
<br>
<p>However, I think that any mind is also going to have an associational
<br>
component, rivalling in power the logical component.
<br>
<p>This means that its logical reasoning is going to be *guided* by
<br>
associations that occur to it based on the sorts of things it's been doing,
<br>
and thinking about, in the past...
<br>
<p>Thus, an AI that's been involved heavily in military matters, is going to be
<br>
more likely to think of violent solutions to problems, because its pool of
<br>
associations will push it that way
<br>
<p>Remember, logic in itself does not tell you how to choose among the many
<br>
possible series of logical derivations...
<br>
<p>I don't want an AGI whose experience and orientation incline it to
<br>
associations involving killing large numbers of humans!
<br>
<p>You may say that *your* AGI is gonna be so totally rational that it will
<br>
always make the right decisions regardless of the pool of associations that
<br>
its experience provides to it....  But this does not reassure me adequately.
<br>
What if you're wrong, and your AI turns out, like the human mind or
<br>
Novamente, to allow associations to guide the course of its reasoning
<br>
sometimes?
<br>
