James Higgins:
<br>
<em>&gt;I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite certain that there are people who display that much raw ego who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100% correct, I just haven't personally met one yet.  On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few truly brilliant people I have met constantly question themselves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rarely, if ever, display much ego.
</em><br>
<p><p>This seems to vary according to social subgroup, actually....
<br>
<p>In academia, a certain sort of modesty is the norm.  Though there is plenty
<br>
of egoism, it's generally muted in expression.  This conservatism of
<br>
expression goes along with a more fundamental conservatism in research
<br>
method.  Ambitious projects like Novamente are considered &quot;borderline&quot;
<br>
because of their excessively broad goals.  Works like CFAI or &quot;Staring into
<br>
the Singularity&quot; (which combine ungrounded speculation with an obvious
<br>
attitude of self-importance on the part of the author) are perceived as
<br>
frivolous at best or crackpottish at worst.
<br>
<p>In the software business, on the other hand, academic-style modesty often
<br>
seems to make people think you're just not very competent...
<br>
<p>One can see this cultural difference in the academic community's reaction to
<br>
Wolfram's recent book &quot;A New Kind of Science.&quot;  Wolfram has been in the
<br>
software industry for the last N years, where self-promotion is the norm.
<br>
But the self-promotional style of his book had the opposite effect on
<br>
academic readers; according to the norm of academia, it made him seem hokey
<br>
and unprofessional.  He is definitely an example of a very brilliant man who
<br>
displays more than his share of ego.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, among Wall Street traders, nearly everyone you meet has
<br>
an incredibly obnoxious and out-there form of egoism.  In &quot;Bonfire of the
<br>
Vanities&quot;, Tom Wolfe referred to traders as Masters of the Universe, but the
<br>
lingo in the business is more evocative: &quot;Big Swingin' Dicks&quot; ;-)
<br>
<p>I think that, in any domain, if you have good communication skills as well
<br>
as brilliance, you can communicate how good you are implicitly, without
<br>
coming across egoistically.  Wolfram should be able to do this, since he is
<br>
a great communicator -- and I think that, if he had put a little effort into
<br>
muting the expression of his egoism in his book, he would have achieved his
<br>
goal of spreading his ideas throughout the world significantly more
<br>
effectively...
