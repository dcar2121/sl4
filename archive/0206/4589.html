hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Modern scientific realism is based on accepting outside reality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observations of physical reality, as the fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determinant of truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, many other traditions are based on accepting *inner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intuitions and experiences* as the fundamental determinants of truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is quite possible to accept both as determinants of truth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps in different domains or aspects of a reality that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large enough to include both and more.   There is no reason one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be only in one camp or the other.  Or even look at it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two different and utterly incompatible camps.
</em><br>
<p>This is correct, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These inner intuitions and experiences are by no means just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual subjectivism with no commonality.  The writings and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teachings of mystics across many traditions, cultures and times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show a great deal of similarity below the particular cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and relgiously imposed coloration of their experiences.  Now, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is certainly possible this similarity is one of similar brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reacting similarly under certain practices and tensions.
</em><br>
<p>yeah.  Aldous Huxley's &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot; is the classic enunciation
<br>
of this point, though other texts make it more systematically and
<br>
scientifically, such as Allan Combs' book &quot;Radiance of Being&quot; from a few
<br>
years back
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I am very familiar with yoga and have been involved in it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some level of practice for some time.  I have at least a reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquantance with other traditions. I find yoga practices and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy excellent training of the mind and emotions and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives me a centering that I cherish.  Does that make me less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to appreciate and participate in science and scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dicussions and activities? No.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, I didn't mean to say there was an either/or thing going on here.
<br>
<p>I have no big conflict between my Zen side and my scientific side.  They
<br>
coexist and accept each others' existence...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see that at all.  I see him going out of his way to not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impose his standards on what the outcome will be or even claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he knows what the ultimate shape of it will be.  He
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually says that it is impossible to impose his standards on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outcome even if he wanted to if this thing is a real AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That looks right to me.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, it is impossible for any of us to impose our standards on an AGI in
<br>
a long-term way.
<br>
<p>It's hard enough for us to impose our standards on our own human children!
<br>
And our children remain at a human intelligence level, share our same
<br>
species, etc.
<br>
<p>However, the initial standards with which we supply an AGI, may impact the
<br>
long-term trajectory of its development.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I certainly don't belief it is fundamentally wrong.  Science is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly valid and wonderful within its built-in applicable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain and limits.  I simply don't believe its boundaries are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end of the real.  Starting an SAI within those boundaries in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no way keeps it from going beyond them if it finds it needful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
