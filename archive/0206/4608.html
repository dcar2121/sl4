hi eliezer
<br>
<p><p>The key question, according to the perspective of my Catholic friend
<br>
(actually we haven't had much contact in recent years, but.. this was a good
<br>
excuse to give him a call ;), is whether the &quot;extremely intelligent mind&quot; in
<br>
question has a soul or not.
<br>
<p>In his view, an intelligent mind without a soul seems like a *bad thing*.
<br>
Whereas if a superintelligent mind has been given a soul by God, then it has
<br>
the ability to find God within itself, as we humans do.
<br>
<p>I think that if you'd posed the question to him, the answer would have been
<br>
basically the same.  (He's an old guy and doesn't e-mail, so I can't forward
<br>
this message to him.)
<br>
<p>As to whether God would deign to assign a soul to a newly created
<br>
superintelligent AGI, he didn't want to venture an opinion...
<br>
<p>I think that the idea of &quot;trying to get at the truth, without reference to
<br>
... faith&quot; (to quote your e-mail) is kind of antithetical to the Christian
<br>
idea that faith is what brings you to the truth...
<br>
<p>Anyway I don't think I'm going to pester that guy again with more silly
<br>
questions, so you'll have to try Dial-a-Christian to pursue this further at
<br>
the moment ;-&gt;
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, Ben, you're asking the question your way rather than my way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question I would ask would run as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Do you believe that an extremely intelligent mind - not necessarily a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human mind - that was just trying to get at the truth, without reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to either faith on the one hand or prideful denial on the other, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to see that a lot of things asserted by Catholicism are true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a lot of things asserted by other belief systems including atheism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are false - enough that if the mind had to pick out which religion was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most likely to be right, it could pick out Catholicism as the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely candidate, regardless of whether the mind actually decided to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become a practicing Catholic and so on?  Assume that the intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can not only do extremely thorough scans for evidence in the external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world but that it can also look into human minds.&quot;
</em><br>
