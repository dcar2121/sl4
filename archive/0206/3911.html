<p>
Does anyone else get the feeling that some of these
<br>
discussions are trying to get too close to the notion
<br>
of *rationality*?   I mean this: while of course the
<br>
whole point is to get a better understanding, allow
<br>
me to quote myself:
<br>
<p>&quot;Words are like ball-bearings on a skating rink:
<br>
to get anywhere, tread lightly and avoid putting
<br>
too much weight on any one of them.&quot;
<br>
<p>The easy part:  adopting the truth of that prescription
<br>
and seeing how in the recent discussion several people
<br>
we'd always describe as &quot;quite rational&quot; scarcely knew
<br>
what they meant by the term.
<br>
<p>The hard part:  getting somewhere, especially in software,
<br>
I suppose, without heavy reliance on hard and well-defined
<br>
concepts.  (I'm confident from what I've read, however,
<br>
that no one is likely to be doing a better job than some
<br>
of the savants on this list.)
<br>
<p>The easy part, again:  criticizing a recent post, (just to
<br>
pick one):
<br>
<p>Gordon writes
<br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is more rational than the other.  Both fellows, if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are not Zen masters, will be attracted by the immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; short-term temptation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, you don't *have* to be a Zen master, but it does help.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This example comes from personal experience, because at one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time this is the kind of thing I would have done.  I've moved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond that and it simply doesn't happen anymore.
</em><br>
<p>Iz zat so?  I'm very skeptical that it is even possible,
<br>
let alone wise, to *always* resist short term temptation.
<br>
(Strange that evolution never stumbled on endowing some
<br>
creature with only long term goals.)  
<br>
<p>I liked Eliezer's discussion of &quot;macho rationality&quot; of
<br>
Thu 6/6/2002 2:04 PM) though I'm not sure I understood
<br>
all of it.  I must point out that over-reliance on long
<br>
term goals is (a) irrational (that's what over-reliance
<br>
means) (b) assumes certain notions of identity.
<br>
<p>(For the latter point, recall those people who claim not
<br>
to be the same person from day to day, or from year to
<br>
year:  for them, sacrificing for the long haul is stupid.)
<br>
<p>I think that the evident preference (for those people we
<br>
tend to call rational) for sacrificing short term prospects
<br>
for long term goals indeed implies stable identity over
<br>
time.  It's those institutions that have been around for
<br>
a long time that gain our greatest respect.
<br>
