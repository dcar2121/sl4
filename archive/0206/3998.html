</em><br>
<p>Software Engineering research over the last 20 years shows that an
<br>
accurate estimate of the lines of code for a project, in advance of its
<br>
implementation, is the most accurate estimate of the total project effort.
<br>
Of course the issue then becomes how do you achieve an accurate estimate
<br>
of lines of code. Having a long and varied career in medium/large
<br>
enterprise systems development and project management, I welcome a
<br>
discussion among AI software implementers here on the issue of deciding
<br>
what features are required for Seed AI and how much effort will be
<br>
required to accomplish a feature.
<br>
<p>I give the Cyc lines of code example because some programmers can
<br>
appreciate the effort required based on that  figure, rather than say it
<br>
is a certain large number of staff-years.  For  example I know that I can
<br>
build a self-designed software system in java  having about 25,000 lines
<br>
of code in a year working furious part time - if I well understand the
<br>
technical obstacles in the project.  Enterprise code writing productivity
<br>
rates are much lower because the total system cost includes the years of
<br>
maintenance programming in which most of the effort is investigation and
<br>
testing.
<br>
<p>In the case above I intentionally left vague what the requirements for a
<br>
minimal symbolic KR and deductive inference software system might be, with
<br>
the sole constraint that it not need do everything that Cyc now does.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;My question to you then would be: Given a budget of 50K LOC, just what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;behaviors would you require the system to have?  Or if your base system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;merely accepts knowledge for the next layer up, how many person-years of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;effort at that next layer would be required to achieve Seed AI, and what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;behaviors would be taught to the system with this budget.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think a complete Novamente could be compressed into 50K lines of C++, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant cost in code comprehensibility and maintainability.  Not a path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we're likely to take though, I'd prefer 200K lines of *good* code ;-&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What on earth is all this LOC talk about?  I haven't seen the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like since we used to brag about getting tiny Basic in less than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2K bytes of machine code.
</em><br>
<p>See for example the web page:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/bu2/PCEHHTML/pceh.htm">http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/bu2/PCEHHTML/pceh.htm</a>
<br>
<p>which describes a software system cost estimation process for NASA.
<br>
<p>The LOC metric was in widespread use well before the advent of
<br>
microcomputers which is why you are confused about its use here.
