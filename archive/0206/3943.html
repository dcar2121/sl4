<p>Yes, that seems quite valid.  I cannot discount the possibility
<br>
that you raise that an ultra-rational program might subsist 
<br>
entirely on its long term goals, only appearing from time to
<br>
time to be giving in to short term concerns.  (In a tangential
<br>
way, I do, however, recommend goals to people derived programs
<br>
that would always obtain *some* reward in the present; but that's
<br>
off into goals of entities.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I liked Eliezer's discussion of &quot;macho rationality&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thu 6/6/2002 2:04 PM) though I'm not sure I understood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all of it.  I must point out that over-reliance on long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; term goals is (a) irrational (that's what over-reliance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means) (b) assumes certain notions of identity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (For the latter point, recall those people who claim not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be the same person from day to day, or from year to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; year:  for them, sacrificing for the long haul is stupid.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your conclusion seems to be based on the unmentioned assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the value system of a person [who claims no long term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity] should necessarily revolve around ver current identity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable or not.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, good reminder.  I was restricting myself to those entities
<br>
whose behavior is (by their own values) self-enhancing.  As you
<br>
write:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, consider a value system where one's current self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not inherently more valuable than the possible future entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling themselves by the same name, or than a random entity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same complexity level at this time or the future.  Thus it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely rational to sacrifice one's well-being if it is expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a being with another identity, be it in some sense the con-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tinuation of the same being or not, will benefit in a greater amount.
</em><br>
<p>We agree that &quot;calling [oneself] by the same name&quot; is merely
<br>
terminological and shouldn't affect the discussion.  But there
<br>
is obviously some friction here between your concept of a
<br>
being &quot;with another identity&quot; but which is a &quot;continuation&quot;
<br>
of the same being.  But I still concede the validity of your
<br>
claim for beings who either strive for no long term identity
<br>
or for those who are uninterested in their present well-being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I do tend to view my identity as transitory, and hold a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious value system based on the ideas outlined above. (My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subconscious value system tends to have some small gripes about that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, manifesting mostly as purported subgoals of the above - ie. &quot;you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to have some fun now if you're going to get anything reasonably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sane done today/this week/ever&quot;. Luckily my suboptimal and partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational mental architecture isn't the issue here.)
</em><br>
<p>That's cool to hold such a value system.  I don't, and as a
<br>
matter of logical necessity, it seems that creatures and
<br>
institutions that do view identity as transitory are indeed
<br>
going to be transitory.
