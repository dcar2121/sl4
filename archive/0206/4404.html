Now this conversation gets interesting...

</em><br>
<p>James, I can see your heart's in the right place... but, I'm afraid you may
<br>
be overestimating the rationality of humans and human groups...
<br>
<p>What if Bill Joy is on the committee?  He's intelligent....
<br>
<p>The Singularity is a highly emotionally charged issue.  There may be humans
<br>
who are simply emotionally opposed to the Singularity, and unable to
<br>
rationally balance the risk of not going forward vs. the risk of going
<br>
forward.
<br>
<p>Similarly, there of course will be humans who are emotionally in love with
<br>
the Singularity, and are so biased in this way that they have a hard time
<br>
rationally balancing the risk of going forward versus not going forward...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The committee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will pick out a set of Asimov Laws designed by Marvin Minsky in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with currently faddish AI principles.
</em><br>
<p>Minsky is a tremendously smart guy -- he's a bit egomaniacal and cussed, but
<br>
he's also basically a techno-optimist without a strong anti-Singularity
<br>
bias.  I have a great respect for him in pretty much all ways.  I think he'd
<br>
be a great choice for such a committee.
<br>
<p><p>My overall reaction to the &quot;committee&quot; idea is as follows.
<br>
<p>1) I don't think a governmentally-appointed committee is likely to work, for
<br>
reasons similar to (but milder than) the ones Eliezer states.  Such a
<br>
committee's membership would be formed by &quot;politics as usual,&quot; it would end
<br>
up with a few Joy types on it as well as a few knee-jerk pro-Singularity
<br>
types and some moderates -- and as such it would never reach a consensus on
<br>
anything, ever, though it might lead to some interesting discussions.
<br>
<p>2) I do think that the decision of whether to launch the Singularity is too
<br>
big for any one person, or any one dedicated research team.  For one thing,
<br>
it's just a HUGE decision; for another thing, there will be a tendency for
<br>
any team to want to see their own AI &quot;go all the way&quot; -- an emotional factor
<br>
that will be hard to overcome for anyone, no matter how mature they are.
<br>
<p>Because of factors 1) and 2), I think that whatever individual or group
<br>
reaches near-human-level-AI is going to have to take it upon themselves to
<br>
assemble an advisory board composed of individuals combining reasonable
<br>
technical expertise and reasonable general wisdom.  If I were in this
<br>
position, I would certainly choose Minsky and Kurzweil, for example, but
<br>
probably not Joy (although I can't say for sure, because I don't know him,
<br>
and for all I know his real views might be milder than the ones he expressed
<br>
in his polemical article and associated interviews).  I do know Jaron
<br>
Lanier, who holds Joy-ish views, and who I would *not* choose for my
<br>
committee, because in spite of his intelligence I feel he holds irrationally
<br>
&quot;knee-jerk&quot; anti-Singularity views.  (And, yeah, Ok, I would choose Eliezer
<br>
as well!)
<br>
<p>I think that a broader discussion group should *also* be assembled,
<br>
involving the more articulate and rational of the rabid
<br>
anti-Singularitarians (Joy, Lanier, etc.) as well as pro-technology people.
<br>
This committee should be assembled in order to gather its opinions only,
<br>
without a view toward decision-making.
<br>
<p>Government is not going to solve this problem.  And I say this as someone
<br>
with fairly democratic-socialist tendencies, not as a typical extropian
<br>
libertarian.  If government tries to manage the Singularity, it's just going
<br>
to drive real Singularity development work underground or overseas.  The
<br>
problem has to be solved by maturity and responsibility on the part of the
<br>
people doing the development, I feel.  This is scary, but to me, it's less
<br>
scary than thinking about the government handling something of such
<br>
importance....  While it's true that gov't is generally good at halting
<br>
action from occurring, by bogging it down in endless bureaucracy, gov't's
<br>
have also been responsible for a hell of a lot of fanatically unwise
<br>
actions -- governmental involvement is far from a prescription for wisdom!!
<br>
