<em>&gt; &gt;I agree with your response to Ben.  We don't expect an AI's belief that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the sky is blue to drift over successive rounds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;self-modification.  Beliefs with an external referent should not &quot;drift&quot;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; correspondence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;with reality.  Write a definition of Friendliness made up of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; references to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;drift&quot;.  If content drifts it will begin making incorrect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;will be corrected by further learning.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that &quot;friendly&quot; is a vastly more ambiguous thing than &quot;blue.&quot;
<br>
<p>The term &quot;friendly&quot;, as used in this context, wraps up all the long-standing
<br>
unsolved issues of moral philosophy...

</em><br>
<p>Yeah, exactly.  This possibility is a consequence of the subtlety and
<br>
ambiguity of the concept of &quot;friendly&quot; or &quot;good&quot; behavior...
<br>
<p>To keep its evolving notion of Friendliness on track, is the AGI supposed to
<br>
compare its notion of Friendliness to its model of Eliezer's notion of
<br>
Friendliness, as a referent?  To Ben's notion of Friendliness?  To the
<br>
Pope's?  To George W. Bush's?  Al Gore's?  Osama bin Laden's?
<br>
<p>What if it finds different peoples' notions of Friendliness are
<br>
inconsistent?  Does it take an average?  What kind of average?
<br>
<p>You may say: there will be commonalities among different peoples' subjective
<br>
views of Friendliness, for instance, everyone agrees that killing people is
<br>
unfriendly.
<br>
<p>OK, then why do we have the death penalty in the US?  Because a lot of folks
<br>
think that what's unfriendly to a murderer, is most friendly to the
<br>
population as a whole?
<br>
<p>Sure, everyone may agree that AGI's should not be involved with executions,
<br>
even if they think humans should be... the death penalty is an extreme
<br>
example.  But it's similar in form to other less extreme examples.
<br>
<p>For a slightly less extreme example, how about manipulating the global
<br>
financial markets?  I knew a derivatives trader who killed thousands of
<br>
people in Malaysia, inadvertently, by shorting their currency and causing a
<br>
financial calamity in their country, resulting in starvation in remote
<br>
regions of the country.  Was this Friendly?  He thought so, because he
<br>
reckoned that by increasing the efficiency of the global financial markets,
<br>
he was increasing the wealth of the world overall, even though it was bad
<br>
for some people temporarily...
<br>
<p>I'm not saying it's *impossible* for &quot;comparison with human ideas on
<br>
Friendliness&quot; to be used to constrain an AGI's evolving notion of
<br>
Friendliness.  But it's certainly not much like using &quot;comparison with human
<br>
ideas on what a pig is&quot; to constrain an AGI's evolving notion of &quot;pig.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A human can understand the words &quot;The intention that was in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmer when writing this line of code&quot;, but they could never fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UNDERSTAND it.  This is why I think you need to have more real life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, Eliezer.  Those of us that are married can easily understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the above is not possible.  You can never FULLY understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else intends by something.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  What are you talking about?  My wife and I always understand each
<br>
others' intentions *perfectly* ;-D
