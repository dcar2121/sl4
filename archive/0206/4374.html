<p>
Eugen Leitl has stated that he considers the FAI and SeedAI memes to be
<br>
dangerous, and wants to fight against them.  I am sure there are others on
<br>
the list who, though not as vociferous, hold similar opinions - or at least
<br>
reservations about the ideas.  Well, that's perfectly fine on the face of
<br>
it.  Opposition to new ideas causes those who are promoting the ideas to
<br>
defend them.  Ideas that are good and correct get improved further, and
<br>
ideas that are bad and false get discarded.  This is how we all make
<br>
progress.  It is a win-win situation where everybody's good ideas get
<br>
improved, and bad ideas get revealed as being bad and discarded.
<br>
<p>But there is a type of opposition that turns that win-win into a lose-lose
<br>
scenario.  By mindlessly opposing a new idea because of an irrational
<br>
belief, much time is wasted by both opposer and opposed.  The 'Creationists'
<br>
debate is a good example of this.  But one does not have to hold an
<br>
irrational belief to turn opposition into a lose-lose activity.  If someone
<br>
wanted to hamper the efforts of SIAI, they could simply 'distract' the
<br>
participants with semi-plausible objections.  This would be intended to
<br>
'burn cycles' of the people most involved in promoting the new ideas.  On
<br>
the surface this might appear to achieve the aim of slowing down the spread
<br>
and/or development of the meme, and in the very short term that might indeed
<br>
be the case.  However, in the mid to long-term, this strategy is
<br>
counter-productive for both parties.  It is counter-productive to the
<br>
opposer because the time taken by the opposed to respond to semi-plausible
<br>
objections could have been spent considering *well thought-out* objections -
<br>
the kind of objections that might improve the idea into a form that the
<br>
opposer would support!
<br>
<p>A single, insightful, well-explained objection is worth a thousand
<br>
semi-plausible critisizms.
<br>
<p>Eugen: If you want to be *effective* in your fight, do your homework!  Give
<br>
us a good argument, not  fuzzy, out-of-focus or generalized critisizms.  I
<br>
do not support FAI because of irrational belief, but because of a detailed
<br>
rational argument.   If futher arguments (or evidence) were presented that
<br>
invalidated FAI, then I would not continue with my support, but would move
<br>
to the 'next best' option... maybe one of your suggested options!
