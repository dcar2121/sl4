RE: How hard a Singularity?
<br>
Rafal,
<br>
<p>There are no really well-fleshed-out interspecies intelligence measures!
<br>
<p>Of course, one could try to make some up, and I've done some work in this
<br>
regard ... but the details of such an endeavor quickly become highly
<br>
involved
<br>
<p>In this case, I think that Eliezer and I actually have a common
<br>
understanding of what &quot;superhuman intelligence&quot; means, even though we don't
<br>
have an agreed-upon rigorous definition.
<br>
<p>One interesting intelligence measure would be the speed with which a system
<br>
can prove a certain set of theorems given a certain set of axioms.  On the
<br>
other hand, mathematical intelligence is only one of many kinds.  A more
<br>
serious intelligence measure would involve measuring the rate at which a
<br>
system can solve a very diverse collection of tasks with known answers
<br>
(including some relatively easy ones and some very hard ones ).   The choice
<br>
of tasks is somewhat arbitrary, reflecting the fact that &quot;intelligence&quot;
<br>
itself is not a precise mathematical concept, but rather an intuitive,
<br>
natural language concept, with a nebulous and shifting meaning.
<br>
<p><p><p>-- ben
<br>
<p><p>****
<br>
<p><p><em>  &gt; I think the period of transition from human-level AI to superhuman-level
</em><br>
AI
<br>
<em>  &gt; will be a matter of months to years, not decades.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose I could see a month, but anything longer than that is pretty
<br>
hard
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to imagine unless the human-level AI is operating at a subjective slowdown
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of hundreds to one relative to human thought.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;### I am exasperated by the lack of rigour in both of the above
<br>
statements - neither one refers to a clearly defined measure of
<br>
&quot;superhumanity&quot; in intelligence. I have a challenge for all - try to come up
<br>
with a way of quantifying what you mean here. The statement that it'll take
<br>
a month from HL-AI to SAI is trivially true - if the HL-AI is worth its
<br>
electricity, it *will* become superhuman in a month, but will it be
<br>
superhuman enough to make a difference?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt there are many ways of quantifying intelligence, in terms of
<br>
absolute performance on standard tasks, in relation to other intelligences,
<br>
by the degree of comprehensibility of its thought/concept/percept content -
<br>
using almost any of them will make the discussion more interesting.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafal
