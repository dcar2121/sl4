<br>
<p>experiment, something which might facilitate discussion.  When I read the
<br>
suggestion that there would be a strong superposed build-up around
<br>
'altruism', I found the idea intriguing... but hardly convincing, as it was
<br>
just an idea within a thought experiment.  If indeed there is actual
<br>
&quot;evidence&quot; to support this idea, I too want to see it.  Thinking further...
<br>
<p>### Eliezer has a point with this hypothesis - I find it quite feasible that
<br>
a superposition of the volitional input of large  numbers of human would
<br>
cancel out certain types of self-directed actions/concepts while leaving
<br>
other concepts unaffected: whenever the wills of two persons clash (are
<br>
producing opposite or incompatible plans for action), as the case usually is
<br>
in actions directly benefitting one of them while harming the other, there
<br>
is a cancelling effect but if there is a motivation aimed at benefitting
<br>
both of them at the same time, such motivations do not cancel. Averaged over
<br>
large numbers of persons there should be a buildup of enlightened
<br>
selfishness - concepts that lead to actions benefitting most while harming
<br>
nobody. This is a good agreement with my intuitive survival-oriented ethics
<br>
(which I described some time ago on the Exilist).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I could also envision a situation where the superposition
<br>
of individual wills would produce a very complicated shape, whose center
<br>
(the normative ethics) would not satisfy any individuals (for more details
<br>
see my discussion with Eliezer on the Exilist earlier this year). 
<br>
<p>------ 
<br>
<p>How would one obtain such evidence?  Through analysis of what people *do*
<br>
perhaps?  Wouldn't you also need to know the reasoning behind thier actions?
<br>
That would involve asking them questions.  How would we judge who was lying,
<br>
or even that they understood the questions?
<br>
<p>IMO, there is unlikely to be any conclusive evidence (of convergence to a
<br>
central definition of 'altruism') until after uploading, and a direct,
<br>
impartial analysis can be made against a population of humans who's wetware
<br>
brains have been accurately simulated in software.  It will be a great time
<br>
to be a cognitive psychologist  :)
<br>
<p>### Very good point, although it might be only necessary to model large
<br>
numbers of humans on a simpler level - not a full personality emulation but
<br>
a better understanding of the interactions between the human cognitive
<br>
subsystems (the analytical versus experience-based, left vs. right
<br>
prefrontal cortex, how do they interact to produce volitional output, how
<br>
discrepancies can be identified and avoided). This would still mean
<br>
understanding humans better than they do but then the FAI is supposed to be
<br>
really smart, or at least smart enough to hold off on actions as long as ve
<br>
does not have such an understanding. 
<br>
<p>Interesting you mention uploading in this context - maybe the future must
<br>
contain both Eliezer's and Eugen's visions to be complete. First the FAI
<br>
develops uploading, then ve invites representative humans, and is finally
<br>
able to understand the Right Thing To Do.
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>But by all means, if someone has real-world evidence of this convergence
<br>
now... bring it forward.
<br>
<p>### The whole history of political progree has a distillation of the general
<br>
from the particular - starting with cliques explicitly aimed at eating
<br>
others, then grudgingly allowing others some freedom in order to be free
<br>
yourself, up to the idea of being nice to all nice people, so that nice
<br>
people would be nice to you.
