hi eugen,

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; I've burned two years of my life working on it. You'd be surprised what
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfortable with cargo cult science.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have your knowledge of cryonics.  $10M sounds low, but my $100B
<br>
figure was intended to be excessively high.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm pleased that, with your greater knowledge of the area, you have
<br>
validated my sense that the problems standing in the way of &quot;really working
<br>
cryonics&quot; are not all that huge anymore.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; On the other hand, with virtually unlimited funding, I think AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about before robust anti-aging/anti-disease
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Life extension research sees order of magnitude more funding than AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development.  This disparity (if any) is likely to grow wider, not less.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that biotech generally is better funded than AI at present.  Funding
<br>
for work specifically on life extension is hard to come by these days, as
<br>
could be attested by Robert Bradbury, John Furber, and others whom I know
<br>
who are specifically working on radical approaches to human life extension.
<br>
<p>However, AI has the big advantage that plenty of us can work on it for free
<br>
in our own homes (the required equipment, computers, are cheaply and readily
<br>
available).  Biotech research still requires substantial lab equipment,
<br>
which means that the amount of research that goes on is relatively limited.
<br>
(I might be doing some biotech research on my own if I had an Affy arrayer
<br>
in my livingroom, but....).  So the amount of funding being given to an
<br>
area, is a fairly weak indicator of the amount of work going on in that
<br>
area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To use an analogy, space travel is expensive, and astronauts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand-picked and receive considerable training. Given that uploading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be at least that expensive initially, don't you think we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise a little diligence, when picking the first crew? Especially,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since it is going to mean a lot to make space travel affordable to Uncle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joe and Aunt Mary?
</em><br>
<p>I agree regarding the first few uploads.  But in the phase after that,
<br>
things will be pretty different, huh?
