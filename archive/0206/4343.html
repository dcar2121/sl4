<p>Only that given more time there will be more interest.  We have awhile 
<br>
before the Singularity is likely to happen.  The closer we get the more 
<br>
people will be aware of, and hopefully open to, the Singularity.  There 
<br>
isn't much else I can think of that would help get more bright people to 
<br>
seriously review the concept.
<br>
<p>The trick, however, is in actually accepting and using that input when it 
<br>
is offered.  Taking any positive criticism seriously and adjusting for it 
<br>
where appropriate.  But I haven't seen much actual change based on others 
<br>
input on this list.  Maybe I'm just blind though (sometimes I do need to 
<br>
get knocked over the head to notice things).
