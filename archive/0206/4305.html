<p>Eugen, are you an engineer?  I believe Mr. Rogers was trying to say that 
<br>
generally referring to systems as &quot;complex&quot; has little meaning.  At least 
<br>
unless you are using a rigid measure of complexity to quantify the 
<br>
implementation difficulty and time required.  Just saying that something is 
<br>
complex does not meet this criteria, of course.  Saying that life is 
<br>
complex and thus an AI must be complex to compete thus has no meaning in an 
<br>
engineering sense.
<br>
<p>As he puts it an AI could easily be considered complex &quot;in a pedestrian 
<br>
sense&quot;, which is true.  But in an engineering sense no one yet knows 
<br>
exactly how complex a good AI implementation will be.  The complexity of 
<br>
the world, however, is completely irrelevant to the problem (since we're 
<br>
not trying to create an Artificial World, just a single Artificial 
<br>
Intelligence that would exist in it).
