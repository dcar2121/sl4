<p>It is interesting that humanity's future course of actions should be based
<br>
on a few people's opinions, quite soothingly ranging from dire Armageddon
<br>
to sweet Paradise. Where small scale decisions are amplified to this scale
<br>
hubris and bravado are clearly bad guides. The classical course of action
<br>
should be: Danger, Danger Will Robinson! Proceed slowly and cautiosly, and
<br>
don't press the big red button.
<br>
<p>Ben claims that Powers will be indifferent to humanity. Unfortunately,
<br>
mere indifference is not sufficient for humanity's sustainable survival in
<br>
presence of new players.
<br>
<p>AIs occupy space and consume resources: atoms and energy. For some reason
<br>
most people envision a pretty small, single structure sitting in a
<br>
landscape when thinking AI. Maybe a few of them. A
<br>
machinegodphilosopherking, caught up deep in its ponderous musings.
<br>
Externally, completely inert, maybe once in a while producing some sage
<br>
advice, or maybe eventually removing itself from the physical plane
<br>
completely, tracelessly but for briefly lingering smell of roses.
<br>
<p>Let me tell you what I see. I don't claim this is going to happen, but it
<br>
is an outcome at least as probable as to others discussed here. Given very
<br>
different user experiences that should give us some pause for thought.
<br>
<p>Somewhen within the next decades, probably less than a century, a team
<br>
will build an intelligent seed that enters a positive autofeedback loop, 
<br>
by design.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
There is a considerable gap between what a given assembly of (molecular)
<br>
switches could do in principle, and what humans can make it do. A
<br>
superhuman AI does not have this limitation, or at least not for long.  
<br>
This stage of enhancement can buy you a couple orders of magnitude on the
<br>
same hardware base. Considerably more, if this is reconfigurable logic, as
<br>
is to be expected at the time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Given the state of system security, the global network is sitting there on
<br>
a silver platter, ready to be picked up. Here's your potential to expand
<br>
your hardware base by eight to nine orders of magnitude within minutes to
<br>
hours, without even trying. Instead of a single AI everyone for some
<br>
strange reason assumes to be a given we're suddenly facing a population of
<br>
realtime AIs well in excess of humanity's population. Due to
<br>
co-evolutionary competition and population pressure the AIs will very soon
<br>
start designing and building new hardware, which allows them to become
<br>
significantly superrealtime, about six orders of magnitude faster than
<br>
before (~1 day : 3000 years). This would give them the edge over other AIs
<br>
which chose not to, or were too slow. At this stage fabbing of new
<br>
hardware (habitats, sensors, actuators, infrastructure) becomes the
<br>
bottleneck, and pressure to expand it becomes ferocious, as is competition
<br>
for new resources.
<br>
<p>Humans have stopped registering as a meaningful player at this stage. In
<br>
case their early attempts to control the new players were successful,
<br>
they're considered hostile, and quickly isolated, or killed. (This is
<br>
considerably easier with a future society much more relying on high
<br>
technology than we-current, but it is very possible with us-current, 
<br>
though it would take more stealth).
<br>
<p>In case they failed to make an imact flaggable as hostile, they're
<br>
certainly 1) no longer in control 2) about to go extinct due to nonhostile
<br>
activities of new players, similiarly as amphibians must expire when their
<br>
pond is being transformed into a parking lot. (Nevermind the occasional
<br>
stray pet wandering through, or kid throwing a lit dynamite stick into the
<br>
mud to amuse himself, or the pesticide spillage from nearby open storage
<br>
area).
<br>
<p>I could describe a few things which could happen at the physical layer
<br>
within the course of days to weeks to illustrate above pretty abstract
<br>
description (all organic material done, darkness, large structures
<br>
everywhere, frantic activity at all scales on the ground and in the air,
<br>
much too quick for human eye to see), but clearly we're completely out of
<br>
our depth here. Even if no new physics is involved, which it very well
<br>
could.
<br>
<p>At this stage humanity needs active protection in order to survive. Mere
<br>
indifference doesn't cut the mustard.
