Hi,
<br>
<p>Most of my knowledge of the history of physics comes from reading works on
<br>
the history of science, not from talking to physicists.
<br>
<p>My favorite philosophers of science are Paul Feyerabend and Imre Lakatos,
<br>
who were good friends but radically disagreed on the nature of scientific
<br>
progress.
<br>
<p>My own take on Theories of Everything is given at the end of the newspaper
<br>
article
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/StringTheoryEtc.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/StringTheoryEtc.htm</a>
<br>
<p>which has one of my favorite titles among all my journalistic offerings,
<br>
<p>&quot;In Search of the Universal Equation: String Theory, Subatomic Computing,
<br>
and Other Bold Attempts to Form a Unified Picture of the Submicroscopic
<br>
World of which our Universe is but a Shadow.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>In there, I include a quote by superstring theorist John Schwarz: “the TOE
<br>
phrase is very misleading on several counts…..    [And] it alienated many of
<br>
our physics colleagues, some of whom had serious doubts about the subject
<br>
anyway.  Quite understandably, it gave them the impression that people who
<br>
work in this field are a very arrogant bunch. Actually, we are all very
<br>
charming and delightful.”
<br>
<p><p>I also say, at the end of the article (most of which summarizes technical
<br>
physics stuff in a nontechnical way):
<br>
<p>&quot;So, let’s suppose the string theorists, or the universal computists, or
<br>
some other group finally achieves their end goal -- unifying quantum theory
<br>
and gravitation, creating one single equation, accounting in principle for
<br>
all phenomena in the universe.  What happens then?  Do the angels descend
<br>
from heaven, dancing and singing in the streets and on the rooftops, serving
<br>
out the wine in holy grails laminated with spinning black holes, bringing
<br>
peace on earth at long long last?   More seriously: does science enter a
<br>
whole new era, where every phenomenon observed is analyzed in terms of the
<br>
one true equation?
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, parts of physics will surely be revolutionized.  There will be new
<br>
technologies, maybe those we envision now like quantum gravity computers or
<br>
time travel machines, maybe other types of things we can hardly imagine now.
<br>
Perhaps, as some maverick theorists believe, new light will be shed on the
<br>
mysteries of biological processes like cell development.
<br>
<p>&quot;But no serious scientist really believes that such a “Theory of Everything”
<br>
(TOE) in principle will really be a theory of everything in practice.  There
<br>
are a number of technical and conceptual points that will stop this from
<br>
happening.
<br>
<p>&quot;For one thing, if string theory or universal computation or some other
<br>
approach succeeds in making quantum theory and gravitation play nice
<br>
together, this still doesn’t explain why our universe is the way it is,
<br>
because it doesn’t explain what physicists call the “initial conditions” of
<br>
the universe: it only explains how things evolved from their starting-point.
<br>
This may seem a small technical point but it’s a big one in practice: there
<br>
may be many, many very different universes consistent with equations as
<br>
general as those of string theory.
<br>
<p>&quot;Next, we may find that one thing the “universal equation” binding quantum
<br>
theory and gravitation teaches us is that some very important things can’t
<br>
be explained or understood.  Just as quantum theory has taught us that
<br>
particles don’t have definite states, the next wave of physics may open up
<br>
new kinds of indeterminacy and unknowability.  We may wind up learning, in
<br>
ever more exquisite detail, why our own finite, macroscopic minds are not up
<br>
to the task of understanding the real world underlying the shadow-world they
<br>
’ve evolved to see.
<br>
<p>&quot;And this latter point ties in with the most serious problem with these
<br>
approaches to physics: the problem of intractable calculations.   Right now,
<br>
the equations of string theory are so hard to solve that we can only really
<br>
understand them in very special cases.    There is an assumption that the
<br>
mathematics of the next century will allow us to make more progress in this
<br>
regard.  But to what extent will this really be true?  Right now, we can’t
<br>
do explicit quantum theory calculations to understand proteins or neurons –
<br>
only very simple molecules.  And we can’t do string theory calculations to
<br>
understand electrons and protons.  To bring string theory to the next level,
<br>
we’ll have to be able to use it to understand electrons and protons, but
<br>
that may be as far as it goes – the elucidation of the implications of these
<br>
micromicromicro-level equations for macroscopic phenomena may remain too
<br>
difficult for mathematicians or computer-simulators to resolve for hundreds
<br>
or thousands of years, or even forever.
<br>
<p>&quot;It all comes down to Plato, and his parable of the cave [this metaphor was
<br>
introduced at the beginning of the article].  From studying these shadows on
<br>
the wall, we can’t really figure out what the birds and trees and squirrels
<br>
are.  But we can learn more and more about them.  We can make deeper and
<br>
deeper theories, some of them explaining the interaction of very small bits
<br>
of shadow, some of them explaining particular kinds of large shadow.  It’s
<br>
vain to think we can fully understand reality, or even fully understand what
<br>
“reality” means.  The very notion of “everything,” when taken seriously,
<br>
intrinsically goes beyond our understanding.  The hubristic search to
<br>
understand everything is valuable insofar as it give us the passion to
<br>
understand more and more, but in more reflective moments, we have to
<br>
acknowledge, as Schwarz did in the quote given above, that we can’t really
<br>
capture the whole big universe in any little box -- not even a box composed
<br>
of the most sophisticated and fantastic equations.&quot;
