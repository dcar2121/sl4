Hi,
<br>
<p>Samantha, you raise a lot of good points in your e-mail and I'll only
<br>
address a couple of them due to lack of time today...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, none of us can answer but from where we are right now.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the answer is that human beings are seen as expendable, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while we are ourselves fully human, then I think that needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be examined and questioned carefully.
</em><br>
<p>It is clear that we humans, generally speaking, view human lives as
<br>
expendable.  A deep study of human history is not necessary to reveal this!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; which are very different attitudes.  I do not personally hold either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attitude, but I can sympathize more with the &quot;indifference&quot; attitude --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because, from the grand perspective, one relatively primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; species may not be all that important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see anything at all &quot;grand&quot; about such a perspective.
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;grand&quot; I mostly meant &quot;very large-scale&quot; rather than &quot;local&quot;.  No value
<br>
judgment was implied.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think the right thing is for the human-race technological vanguard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simultaneously work on building artificial superintelligence, AND on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creating better humans beings (genetic engineering, brain augmentation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ethics, morality, better social and economic systems...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And in fact, this is what is happening.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not at all clear to me that the non-hardware parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem are being addressed much.
</em><br>
<p>I guess that, right now, it is technically oriented folks who *see* the
<br>
Singularity coming, so that most of the writing and thinking regarding it is
<br>
technical in nature.
<br>
<p>As Singularity awareness spreads more broadly, non-tech-focused people will
<br>
have more to say about it I'm sure.
<br>
<p>There are certainly some very hard problems here.  For example, keeping any
<br>
kind of freedom and democracy going in a population of same-species
<br>
organisms is tough enough.  How to keep these qualities alive in a world
<br>
full of sentients with radical differences in intelligence and other
<br>
qualities, is a problem that may be beyond human intelligence....  I doubt
<br>
these problems will be solved prior to the creation of superhuman minds.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I think it is possible to achieve some degree of nonattachment from one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; species, in terms of one's reasoning and one's value system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can never completely remove inferential and emotional bias from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneself --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's not even clear what this would mean!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hardly see how to build a value system on the well-being of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that which does not yet exist.
</em><br>
<p>In fact, humanity has so far failed to build anything near a consensus value
<br>
system regarding *human well-being*.
<br>
<p>I strongly suspect that moral and social thinking is going to continue to
<br>
flail around, raising interesting questions and loads of possible answers
<br>
but arriving at no definite conclusions.  Meanwhile, technological
<br>
development will proceed more and more rapidly, dragging the moral/social
<br>
aspect along with it....  I am not saying this is necessarily *good*, just
<br>
making a prediction.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
