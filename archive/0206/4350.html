<em>&gt;Fair enough.  I should have been more clear.  When asking a large enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;audience about a topic such as designed Friendliness, where we have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience, we can expect people to disagree.  We can't absolutely reject

</em><br>
<p>True, there will always be some descent.  I don't expect, and would not 
<br>
require, 100% agreement to proceed.  However, with something as significant 
<br>
and dangerous as the Singularity the descent must be rigorously and 
<br>
thoroughly examined as much as possible.  Also, just because an issue 
<br>
raised may not be checkable doesn't mean it isn't valid.  I don't see how 
<br>
the whole friendliness system proposed is checkable.  Heck, I don't even 
<br>
see how it is workable in most cases.  The idea that it could remain 
<br>
essentially unchanged after many thousands, quite possibly millions, of 
<br>
subjective modifications, most likely including complete rewrites, seems 
<br>
rather far fetched.  At least without some serious proof.
