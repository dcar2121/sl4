<p>I disagree.
<br>
<p>In my book, if the infrahuman AI that thinks in this has decent odds of
<br>
evolving into a superhuman AI ... then this killer infrahuman AI is a really
<br>
serious problem!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A disagreement with a transhuman AI is pretty much

</em><br>
<p>No the comfort level of the AI with killing people also counts, it seems to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ben, what makes you think that you and I, as we stand, right now, do not

</em><br>
<p>Well, based on your various disturbing comments in these recent threads, I'm
<br>
a lot more sure about me than about you ;-)
<br>
<p>According to your recent posts,
<br>
<p>a) an AGI project forming an advisory board of Singularity wizards is
<br>
suicidal
<br>
<p>b) training infrahuman AI's to kill is morally unproblematic
<br>
<p>c) whomever creates an AGI, intrinsically has enough wisdom that they should
<br>
be trusted to personally decide the future of the human race
<br>
<p>Well, the point of view that led to these statements seems to *me* to embody
<br>
some moral errors...
<br>
<p>Regarding your comments on the subjectivity of morality: Yes, I understand
<br>
that my own morality, which has a tendency (though not an absolute one)
<br>
toward pacifism, is not shared by all.  This is part of my motivation for
<br>
thinking that, when a near-human-level-AI comes about, an advisory board of
<br>
Singularity wizards would be a good thing.  Of course, this group will
<br>
*still* not have an objective morality -- there is no true objectivity in
<br>
the universe -- but it would have a broader and less biased view than me or
<br>
any other individual.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p>p.s. regarding &quot;rationality&quot; and my use of the term versus yours, that would
<br>
be a long and detailed discussion, which would distract from the current
<br>
thread, so I'll defer it.
