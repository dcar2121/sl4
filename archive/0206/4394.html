</em><br>
<em>&gt;James,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you believe that a committee of experts could be assembled to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;successfully build an AI?  Or even to successfully judge which new AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theories are most likely to succeed?
</em><br>
<p>Do I believe a committee could successfully build an AI?  Maybe.  But I 
<br>
don't think it would be a good idea to do it that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If not, why would they be able to do it for Friendly AI?
</em><br>
<p>I never said they could, or should, DESIGN anything.  Simply approve 
<br>
designs.  Zoning committees don't build anything, but they are important to 
<br>
maintain order in a metropolitan area.  I believe a Singularity Committee 
<br>
(or whatever it should be called - I'd like to avoid the term &quot;committee&quot;) 
<br>
would be a very useful asset to the human race.  Although I can see where 
<br>
it could easily be seen as a detriment to will-full, single-minded, solo 
<br>
players or even like minded teams.  Individual accomplishment is irrelevant 
<br>
in light of the Singularity, successful completion of the project in the 
<br>
safest manor possible is the only rational goal.
<br>
<p>I believe your goal, Eliezer, is to make the Singularity as friendly and 
<br>
safe as possible, is it not?  If so you should welcome such a committee as 
<br>
a way to ensure that the safest and most friendly design is the one 
<br>
launched.  You should under no circumstances fear such a committee since, 
<br>
if you really are destined to engineer the Singularity, the committee would 
<br>
certainly concede that your design was the best when it was presented to them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sometimes committees are not very smart.  I fear them.
</em><br>
<p>I don't like committees either, and I can understand why you, in 
<br>
particular, would fear such a committee.  It would take away your ability 
<br>
to single handedly, permanently alter the fate of the human race.  Which is 
<br>
exactly why such a committee would be a good thing.  Such decisions are too 
<br>
big for any one person to make.
<br>
<p>If you were on trial for murder and up for the death penalty, would you 
<br>
want one single person to decide your fate or a jury of people?
<br>
