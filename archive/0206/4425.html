Ben asked for more info about the Darpa Program Manager / Deputy Program
<br>
Manager career path.  Any researchers on this list should take note.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the www.darpa.mil web site <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/hrd/seo.htm">http://www.darpa.mil/hrd/seo.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>The DARPA mission is to change people's minds as to what is possible.
<br>
Through the hiring of Scientists and Engineers as DARPA Program Managers,
<br>
the impossible becomes a reality. The DARPA Program Manager works with the
<br>
technical community to accelerate technology innovation, deployment, and
<br>
manufacturing learning. New projects are introduced each year. As a
<br>
result, we are continually looking for new managers.
<br>
<p>The ideal Program Manager is technically deep, with excellent but eclectic
<br>
technology tastes, usually seasoned by five or more years of
<br>
accomplishment in industry, the military, or academia. He must be able to
<br>
integrate, innovate, and readily accept new ideas proposed by others. He
<br>
formulates a vision for the program; positions and advocates the program
<br>
within the context of DARPA's overall mission; charts a course for the
<br>
near-and long-term accomplishments necessary to reach the program
<br>
objectives; and manages all technical, procurement, and financial aspects
<br>
of the program. A Program Manager must complement technical excellence
<br>
with management and leadership skills, including people skills, public
<br>
speaking skills, project management experience, careful financial
<br>
management skills, the ability to make timely decisions, and a sense of
<br>
controlled urgency.
<br>
<p>As a DARPA Program Manager, you can invest four years in public service
<br>
and make a difference. It will change the way you view the world. It will
<br>
be a service to your technical community and to the Nation. You can move
<br>
the world, if you stand in the right place.
<br>
<p><p>...and here is some text describing the mission of one Darpa office:
<br>
<a href="http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/">http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/</a>
<br>
<p>DARPA's IPTO will create a new generation of computational and information
<br>
systems that possess capabilities far beyond those of current systems.
<br>
These cognitive systems - systems that know what they're doing:
<br>
<p>* will be able to reason, using substantial amounts of appropriately
<br>
represented knowledge;
<br>
<p>* will learn from their experiences and improve their performance over
<br>
time;
<br>
<p>* will be capable of explaining themselves and taking naturally
<br>
expressed direction from humans;
<br>
<p>* will be aware of themselves and able to reflect on their own
<br>
behavior;
<br>
<p>* will be able to respond robustly to surprises, in a very general
<br>
way.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vision to senior Darpa management - in competition with other program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; managers.  There is a good deal of turnover with Darpa PMs so Darpa is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allays looking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This is sort of an amusing idea.  Specifically what sort of career path
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would one follow to secure such a position?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've got 8 years in academia and 5 years in the software industry -- am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualified? ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would suppose that getting significant DARPA funding for one's own work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a good first step, or is this not the case?
</em><br>
<p>No, most of the Darpa PMs I know of, were not Darpa funded researchers
<br>
beforehand.  Probably there is a conflict of interest bias at Darpa
<br>
against hiring from funded contractors.
