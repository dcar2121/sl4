Hey Ben,
<br>
<p>Does that include genetic programming? 
<br>
<p>I don't know how long it will take for us to write an
<br>
intelligently aware AI program.
<br>
<p>Instead, as is currently becomming pretty vogue,
<br>
allowing the program to write itself might be a faster
<br>
approach, even though it seems 'inefficient' due to
<br>
its randomness. However, I still think that a lot of
<br>
these genetic models are good, but still focus too
<br>
heavily on creating &quot;that one perfect seed&quot;. It's way
<br>
too top-down.
<br>
<p>One of Warwick's students over at Reading, back a few
<br>
years ago, seemed to have the right approach. He took
<br>
the famous 'learning robots' from the lab and
<br>
downloaded their environment and their code into his
<br>
computer and carried out some robotic
<br>
evolutionary-type modelling. He managed to run through
<br>
generations so much quicker than the Cybernetics
<br>
Dept's classroom. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't believe that the programs could
<br>
randomly mutate their own code. In addition, the focus
<br>
was evolving strategies to best survive in a &quot;pen&quot; in
<br>
one of the dept's classrooms. So, learned winning
<br>
behaviors became more advanced while the program did
<br>
not. Obviously, this is fun for only so long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my perspective, a new approach to this method
</em><br>
could make real headway with relatively few lines of
<br>
code, many versions, access to a simple command
<br>
library, and a whole lot of computing power. And I
<br>
don't mean rewriting the entire program, or gen 1
<br>
redesigning itself from some grand plan. Just simple
<br>
changes, line by line, over time.
<br>
<p>Are you aware of anyone working in this direction?
<br>
<p>Re: Aaron's &quot;mid-night hackers&quot;. I think that he's
<br>
right, especially in light of grid computing.
<br>
Computing power may be a stumbling block not for the
<br>
sake of the AI itself, but because GP requires so darn
<br>
many evolving programs to get any results in a
<br>
reasonable amount of time. The SETI software, though
<br>
not truly advanced grid, is a glimpse of how this
<br>
stuff will become accessable to all of us soon.

Now you always say that you want to be free
<br>
You're searching for good times, but just wait and see
<br>
You'll come running back... 
<br>
Yeah, time, time time is on my side (Yes it is)
<br>
I said, time, time, time is on my side (Yes it is)
<br>
I said, time, time, time is on my side
