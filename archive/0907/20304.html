<p>
I'm playing around with the idea of doing a paper on the hive mind
<br>
aspect of an uploaded society (see
<br>
<a href="http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2009-February/047770.html">http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2009-February/047770.html</a>
<br>
for my previous post on the topic), for which I need to do a survery
<br>
on the previous academic discussions on mind uploading. Both journal
<br>
articles and books are fine - also, if any of you happen to know of
<br>
any fictional works concerning uploading where the people involved
<br>
eventually develop into a hive mind, do mention them. (Note that I'm
<br>
specifically looking for hive minds that have developed from *human
<br>
uploads*. I'm not looking for AI hive minds, cyborg hive minds or hive
<br>
minds in general - I know that scifi has plenty of *those*.)
<br>
<p>Here are the academic uploading articles which I'm already aware of
<br>
(which might also be a handy reference for anyone else interested in
<br>
the topic).
<br>
<p>Non-fiction about uploading in general:
<br>
<p>Anders Sandberg &amp; Nick Bostrom (2008): Whole Brain Emulation: A
<br>
Roadmap, Technical Report #2008-3. Future of Humanity Institute,
<br>
Oxford University. (An analysis of what is yet required for uploads.)
<br>
Robin Hanson (1994, 2008): If uploads come first - The crack of a
<br>
future dawn; Economics of the Singularity. (Hanson's classic must-read
<br>
papers on the economic consequences of uploads.)
<br>
Susan Schneider (2008): Future Minds: Transhumanism, Cognitive
<br>
Enhancement and the Nature of Persons. Neuroethics Publications.
<br>
(Critique of uploading on the grounds that an uploaded copy &quot;would be
<br>
just a clone, not you&quot;, and seems to assume that this can just be
<br>
taken as granted. Groan.)
<br>
V. Astakhov (2008): Mind Uploading and Resurrection of Human
<br>
Consciousness. Place for Science? NeuroQuantology. (/Seems/ to discuss
<br>
some sort of theory for the actual upload process. I think. Not sure
<br>
if it's entirely serious, but at least I'm unable to follow it.)
<br>
Ray Kurzweil (2005): The Singularity is Near. (Briefly discusses the
<br>
possibility of uploading.)
<br>
Nick Bostrom (2004): The Future of Human Evolution. In Death and
<br>
Anti-Death: Two Hundred Years After Kant, Fifty Years After Turing.
<br>
(The only paper I could find that actually discusses a hive mind -like
<br>
scenario.)
<br>
Hans Moravec (2000): Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind.
<br>
(Mentions uploading in the form of a &quot;cyberspace&quot; that people will
<br>
move into.)
<br>
Robert Harle (2002): Cyborgs, Uploading and Immortality - Some Serious
<br>
Concerns. Sophia, Volume 41, Number 2. (Mainly attempts to debunk the
<br>
whole idea of uploading. Humorous for stating that &quot;the most serious
<br>
problem for uploaders&quot; is the fact that a brain cannot function
<br>
without body, completely ignoring the possibility of *gasp* people
<br>
also simulating a body. Not very interesting.)
<br>
Hans Moravec (1988): Mind Children. (Has a brief description of an
<br>
upload process.)
