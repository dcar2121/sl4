The Singularity Institute will be holding the fourth annual
<br>
Singularity Summit in New York in October, featuring talks by Ray
<br>
Kurzweil, David Chalmers, and Peter Thiel.
<br>
<p>New York, NY (PRWEB) July 17, 2009 -- The fourth annual Singularity
<br>
Summit, a conference devoted to the better understanding of increasing
<br>
intelligence and accelerating change, will be held in New York on
<br>
October 3-4 in Kaufmann Hall at the historic 92nd St Y. The Summit
<br>
brings together a visionary community to further dialogue and action
<br>
on complex, long-term issues that are transforming the world.
<br>
<p>Participants will hear talks from cutting-edge researchers and network
<br>
with strategic business leaders. The world's most eminent experts on
<br>
forecasting, venture capital, emerging technologies, consciousness and
<br>
life extension will present their unique perspectives on the future
<br>
and how to get there. &quot;The Singularity Summit is the premier
<br>
conference on the Singularity,&quot; says Ray Kurzweil, inventor of the CCD
<br>
flatbed scanner and author of The Singularity is Near. &quot;As we get
<br>
closer to the Singularity, each year's conference is better than the
<br>
last.&quot;

Bay Area, where it has been featured in numerous publications
