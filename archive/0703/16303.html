<em>&gt; &gt; Now, revealing new research shows that people with damage to a key

<em>&gt; There's a critical omission in the above quote. It should read &quot;...based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they _wrongly believe_ to be the greater good of the community&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because let's face it, such judgements _are usually wrong_. Look at history,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at all the people who've lived by philosophies like &quot;the greatest good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the greatest number&quot; and &quot;the end justifies the means&quot;. The track record

</em><br>
<em>&gt; bloody disasters, hasn't it? And the smarter the people involved, the worse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the disaster.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are damn good reasons why we have limits on what we're allowed do no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how loudly we chant the slogan &quot;greater good of the community&quot; while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're doing it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is indeed why our evolutionary heritage has provided a moral
<br>
damper on actions that generally tend to be anti-adaptive.  You also
<br>
rightly point out some limitations and incoherence of utilitarian
<br>
reasoning.
<br>
<p>What is traditionally missing though, is recognition of our more
<br>
recent understanding of cooperative dynamics, game theory, etc.  We
<br>
are now at the point where we can begin implementing systems of
<br>
collaborative social decision-making based on increasing awareness of
<br>
our shared values that work promoted by increasing awareness of
<br>
methods that work.
<br>
<p>Rather than &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; because it feels wrong, and because
<br>
it's a moral imperative encoded into our culture, we can see how this
<br>
is actually a reflection of principles of cooperative advantage that
<br>
made us what we are and will also make our future.
<br>
<p>Rather than fears of &quot;Science&quot; enforcing an oppressive convergence of
<br>
humanity into a single mold of the &quot;ideal man&quot;, we are learning that
<br>
diversity must be one of our highest values, and that the increasingly
<br>
probable tree of knowledge leads to an increasing variety of possible
<br>
branches.
<br>
<p>Just at the moment we face novel technological threats of complexity
<br>
and speed outmatching our innate sense of moral right and wrong, our
<br>
slow system of cultural ethics, we find ourselves within grasping
<br>
distance of technologically augmented morality, truer than the moral
<br>
capabilities of any humans, based on evolving human values.
<br>
<p>Since this is the Sl4 list I'll be very explicit that this is not a
<br>
vision of a savior machine, but rather, the human machine becoming a
<br>
more capable machine.
