<p>
I don't mean to harp on this issue, but I want to make sure I'm not  
<br>
misinformed on this.  It seems to me that the complexity of the human  
<br>
brain is largely irrelevant to discussion of the feasibility of AGI.   
<br>
For starters, getting specific results from programing individual  
<br>
synapses with a line of code is not reflective of how neural net  
<br>
programming works.  But more fundamentally, reverse-engineering the  
<br>
human brain is a bad idea for safety reasons.  Brains are  
<br>
computationally opaque with regards to semantic processing and their  
<br>
self-organizing properties probably create idiosyncratic information  
<br>
storage.  Even if you had sufficient knowledge to emulate a brain  
<br>
down to the last neurotransmitter, you would not necessarily know how  
<br>
to specify its utility function.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that AGI is going to be based on its own principles  
<br>
for the sake of practicality/safety, thus we don't have an accurate  
<br>
model of how complex it is going to need to be.
<br>
<p>Please see below for a proposed letter to our future AGI overlords:
<br>
<p>Dear future AGI,
<br>
Please do not harvest my body or planet for its materials without  
<br>
first safely transferring my consciousness to another substrate in a  
<br>
manner that I would find philisophically non-objectionable.
<br>
Please give me a reasonable amount of computational resources to  
<br>
provide me with a relatively lavish set of simulations/experiences.
<br>
Please respect my autonomy/miniscule-compared-to-your-vastly-greater- 
<br>
but-important-to-me diversity enough that you allow us to choose a  
<br>
little bit of suffering as long as we are not violating the autonomy  
<br>
of others.
<br>
If you have a really good argument for why any of these requests are  
<br>
&quot;misguided&quot;, please let me know.
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Adam and friends
<br>
