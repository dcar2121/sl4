<p>
There is the only-slightly-crazier question of whether a physical computer
<br>
is needed at all. It would neatly explain everything, dispensing with such
<br>
questions as why does anything exist, if we accept that physical reality and
<br>
mathematical reality, sometimes called the Plenitude or Platonia, are one
<br>
and the same.
<br>
<p>BTW, an 8086 can simulate anything that is computable, given a long enough
<br>
time. An infinite physical computer could exist if time is infinite or if a
<br>
way could be found to fit infinite computations into finite time, as per
<br>
Tipler's Omega Point scenario. Then there is the elusive definition of what
<br>
counts as a computation, or equivalently what counts as a physical
<br>
implementation of a particular abstract machine. You could map any
<br>
computation to the null state; of course, all the &quot;work&quot; of the computation
<br>
would be in the mapping, but the mapping does not have to be made explicit.
<br>
This is effectively the same result as above: all computations are
<br>
necessarily implemented by virtue of their status as mathematical objects in
<br>
the Plenitude, and the anthropic principle explains why we find ourselves in
<br>
one of those computations which give rise to observers.
