<p>I'm kind of surprised that no one here has brought up what I thought  
<br>
to be the obvious alternative path that the story could have taken.  
<br>
About half of the plot leads from first seeding the simulated  
<br>
universe and then fast forwarding to the present day, basically  
<br>
slowing down the fast forward as they approach realtime so that they  
<br>
don't skip over the present moment. Then they get to the present  
<br>
moment and arbitrarily *stop* because they are so intrigued by the  
<br>
novelty of looking at themselves.
<br>
<p>I loved the direction that the story actually did take, but for a  
<br>
number of paragraphs I was utterly convinced that the story was going  
<br>
to be about what happened when they sped up the simulation *past* the  
<br>
present moment. You would have the same infinite nested universes,  
<br>
but each would be running successively faster than its containing  
<br>
universe. Instead of converging into a stability, the recursion would  
<br>
veer off exponentially.
<br>
<p>Even if you didn't speed up the simulation but just advanced it  
<br>
forward two seconds or two minutes and kept it at your universe's  
<br>
speed, what would you see? It would depend on what your simulation's  
<br>
simulation was seeing, of course, all the way down. Presumably at  
<br>
some point (eventually) the simulation would be shut down in one of  
<br>
the nestings, for whatever reason. Perhaps the parents of those  
<br>
universes would contain versions of yourself which go bonkers because  
<br>
they realize that they're next.
<br>
<p>It seems that the scenario presented in the story would be incredibly  
<br>
hard to get &quot;just right,&quot; actually, since you would need to sync the  
<br>
simulation precisely (to infinite decimal places, of course) to the  
<br>
time scale of your own universe. Presumably in order to do such  
<br>
syncing you'd need to measure atomic oscillations or something in  
<br>
your universe with the aforementioned infinite precision, as a frame  
<br>
of reference for your simulation.
<br>
<p>This doesn't seem possible to me, but then neither does relying on  
<br>
deterministic models of physics to get an exact replica of this  
<br>
moment. Assuming we could just compute all possible universes and do  
<br>
instant queries on any of it, the problem then becomes generating  
<br>
queries which are relevant. I think if this scenario were ever to  
<br>
take place, the first thing you'd definitely want to do would be to  
<br>
get an AI running on the thing which can do the queries for you.
