<p>Well, it is a bit more than that. In relativity, it isn't clearcut
<br>
what is time and what is space. That is, what one observer measures as
<br>
a purely spacial or purely temporal interval, another observer would
<br>
measure as some combination theirof, even though they'd both agree on
<br>
the magnitude of the interval, as determined by the metric (in flat
<br>
spacetime that being the minkowski metric)
<br>
<p>So saying it is pure rubbish is perhaps a bit much.
<br>
<p>Talking about anything as &quot;the&quot; fourth dimension is questionable. But
<br>
saying that spacetime is four dimensional, and that one can't really
<br>
meaningfully seperate the space and time dimensions unambiguously is a
<br>
whole other thing.
