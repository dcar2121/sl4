<p><em>&gt; Yah, who knows, time may progress diagonally

</em><br>
<p>Time is a function of data processing. All the
<br>
arrows of time recognized by physics are the
<br>
result of changes which run only in one direction
<br>
(entropy, nuclear decay, and so on). Information,
<br>
as presently understood by science, is only
<br>
available about past events, i.e. events that
<br>
have left a physical trace. While Feynman
<br>
diagrams may run equally in forward or backward
<br>
directions, we experience past time only, as a
<br>
result of those physical traces in our brains or
<br>
in physical objects we are able to sense. For
<br>
this reason, even if universes with 'backwards
<br>
time' existed, their inhabitants would still
<br>
experience it as ordinary 'forward time.' Any
<br>
arguments you may encounter that time would
<br>
reverse at some later epoch in the universe would
<br>
founder on this fact.
<br>
<p>Time can be usefully considered as an information
<br>
dimension, as all other dimensions are. Though
<br>
spatial dimensions can be described as N feet or
<br>
N meters, time has been described in terms of
<br>
degrees of change. Even the oldest systems of
<br>
timekeeping sliced time into day/night cycles,
<br>
changes of the moon and seasons. These were
<br>
low-tech observations of purely local events,
<br>
germane to our planet alone; but now physicists
<br>
know something of the granularity of spacetime.
<br>
The smallest bit of space is the Planck length
<br>
and the smallest bit of time is the Planck
<br>
interval, there being no physical/energetic event
<br>
in our universe that can happen in any smaller
<br>
space or time; but like the day or the lunar
<br>
cycle, the Planck time is predicated on an
<br>
experienced change. There can be nothing
<br>
arbitrary about it, relativity notwithstanding.
<br>
<p>The fact that we know spacetime is granular and
<br>
has a time arrow strongly implies that physical
<br>
reality really is like a computer program,
<br>
cellular automata, Go, or some similar stepwise
<br>
iterated process. This could mean we are living
<br>
in a sim, or it could mean that's the only way to
<br>
build any universe.
