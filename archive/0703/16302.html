<p>Yes, and quite necessarily, if one's actions are to have a perceivable
<br>
effect on one's environment, thus completing a feedback loop enabling
<br>
subjective progress.  Extending this thinking leads to the idea of an
<br>
expanding sphere of ethical inclusion and consequences, such expansion
<br>
corresponding to increasing moral wisdom.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is what the

</em><br>
<p>I agree with the intent of this statement, although I don't see
<br>
emotionality as a level of organization so much as a functional
<br>
description, and I would rather say it satisfices than optimizes a
<br>
moral solution.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'd much rather have a relentlessly, indeed even ruthlessly ethical AI
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're highly unlikely to be the inner circle and very likely to be
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This study's results were well-written, IMO, showing the key role of
<br>
emotion in *normal* human moral judgment.  Unfortunately, most readers
<br>
will accept the implied dichotomy between emotional and utilitarian
<br>
moral judgment without realizing that these are each special cases of
<br>
following principles of cooperative advantage -- the former encoded
<br>
more at the level of the organism, the latter encoded more at the
<br>
level of culture.
<br>
<p>My motivation for engaging in these discussions of morality is to sow
<br>
the idea that humanity is now facing the possibility--and the
<br>
necessity--of raising ethical judgment to a higher level, with
<br>
cognitive capability greater than that of humans or culture, based on
<br>
an overarching cognitive framework supported by evolving human values.
<br>
<p>Yes, ethical actions must be ruthless, in the sense of focusing on
<br>
principles rather than ends.  And such actions are assessed as moral
<br>
to the extent that they are assessed to promote shared human values
<br>
that work over increasing scope.
