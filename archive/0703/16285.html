<br>
<p>The Economist has a good article on applications of Brain to Computer
<br>
Interfacing to computer games: &quot;the promises of, respectively, Emotiv
<br>
Systems and NeuroSky, two young companies based in California, that
<br>
plan to transport the measurement of brain waves from the medical
<br>
sphere into the realm of computer games. If all goes well, their first
<br>
products should be on the market next year. People will then be able
<br>
to tell a computer what they want it to do just by thinking about it&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;First applications are most likely to be single-player computer games
<br>
running on machines such as Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's
<br>
PlayStation 3. In the longer term, though, he thinks the system will
<br>
be ideal for controlling avatars (the visual representations of
<br>
players) in multiplayer virtual worlds such as Second Life&quot;.
<br>
<p>Before becoming available to Second Life users, the new neural
<br>
interfaces might be available to PlayStation 3 owners in Sony's
<br>
forthcoming new service, Home, that puts users into a real-time,
<br>
networked 3D community, where they can interact, join online games,
<br>
communicate, share content and even build and show off their own
<br>
personal spaces.  Home will be available this fall as a free download
<br>
from the PlayStation Store..
<br>
<p>Home looks impressive: Second Life with the graphic quality of a
<br>
console videogame. Take a look here and imagine moving in this world
<br>
and interacting with things by thought. Add fullly imemrsive headset
<br>
displays… wow!
<br>
<p>The first applications of neural interfacing have been in the medical
<br>
field. See for example the recent breakthroughs of Cyberkinetics,
<br>
whose technology used in medical pilot projects has permitted severely
<br>
disabled patients interacting with computers by thought. Now this
<br>
technology is finding its way to the consumer market. I am not
<br>
surprised at all to see that the first consumer applications of neural
<br>
interfacing are developed for the computer gaming industry. In the
<br>
computer gaming market there is a lot of money and there will be even
<br>
more money, and game companies are able to attract very bright and
<br>
creative people everywhere. I am more and more persuaded that other
<br>
transhumanist holy grails, such as conscious artificial intelligence,
<br>
will be first developed by the computer gaming industry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Emotiv website: &quot;Our mission is to create the ultimate
</em><br>
interface for the next-generation of man-machine interaction, by
<br>
evolving the interaction between human beings and electronic devices
<br>
beyond the limits of conscious interface. Emotiv is creating
<br>
technologies that allow machines to take both conscious and
<br>
non-conscious inputs directly from your mind&quot;. From the NeuroSky
<br>
website: &quot;Brainwaves have been used in medical research and therapy
<br>
for years. We're bringing it to the consumer world&quot;.
<br>
<p>So we will soon be able to think our way in Home and Second Life. If a
<br>
computer can read information from our brains, it won't be long before
<br>
it can also write information directly to our brains and very fast:
<br>
two way neural interfaces that will make computer screens and headsets
<br>
obsolete, a Second Life that goes directly to the brain bypassing the
<br>
eyes. And when our virtual environments will contain artificial
<br>
intelligences, perhaps smarter than us, we will be able to communicate
<br>
with them at the speed of thought. Let's call things by their name:
<br>
these first baby steps to neural interfacing for consumers will lead
<br>
to *the* transhumanist Holy Grail: mind uploading, the transfer of
<br>
human consciousness out of the brain into much higher performance
<br>
supports, where we will be able to interact and merge with our AI mind
<br>
children.
