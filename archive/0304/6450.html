<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks Perry, thats all i need to know. Clearly i want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my systems to be a little more generic than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formal systems
</em><br>
<p>Well, sadly the Church-Turing Thesis has yet to be disproven, so I'm
<br>
afraid that for now your wants may remain unfulfilled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; because of set-theory-envy, if set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory has uncountable sets why cant the set of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive entities be uncountable?
</em><br>
<p>Why? Because mathematics isn't infinitely mutable. We have this notion
<br>
of proof, which is a means of going from a set of axioms to a theorem
<br>
via a sequence of finitely many productions of an unrestricted
<br>
grammar. That's the core of our idea of what mathematics means, and
<br>
set theory is easily contained within that idea. The number of axioms
<br>
for simple forms of set theory is pretty low.
<br>
<p>By the way, we've also done a lot of work for about the last century
<br>
tightening up what we know about formal systems, proof and computation
<br>
-- and they're all inextricably linked. So far, we haven't found
<br>
anything more potent than our formal systems, Turing machines and
<br>
lambda calculi.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or even infinite to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same extent as the set of all sets is infinite
</em><br>
<p>What is the &quot;set of all sets&quot;? Many kinds of set theory can't express
<br>
such a thing. Again, you keep throwing out ideas about sets as though
<br>
they somehow had a life outside a particular flavor of set
<br>
theory. They don't, any more than the integers have a life outside of
<br>
theories like Peano's axioms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is literally the set of all formal systems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because it is the set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of all consistent mathematical systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I consider formal systems to be a subset of the set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent mathematical systems but you have equated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>What other sort of mathematics is there outside of formal systems?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Of course, if you're going to bring things down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the level of &quot;set&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you start getting into a much deeper problem. &quot;Sets&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interact. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly. Sets dont interact,
</em><br>
<p>And as a result, in Tegmark's sense, they aren't capable of supporting
<br>
self aware substructures, so there isn't an operational way of
<br>
assessing their reality...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And if you were willing to accept that we aren't in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a universe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; move on to &quot;sets&quot; as your fundamental universes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what sort of set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory are you going to adopt as &quot;fundamental&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; After all, in some set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theories, you get the axiom of choice, in some you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't. In some, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; continuum hypothesis is an axiom, in some it isn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The list goes on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Axioms are not something i worry about too much:
</em><br>
<p>Could you tell me a bit about your background? Do you know much about
<br>
set theory or metamathematics to begin with? If not, perhaps it would
<br>
be more profitable to have this discussion after you've read a bit
<br>
more on notions like formal systems and set theory...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Sets, you see, aren't as primitive as formal systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at all, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; though they are much less powerful, just as integers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aren't as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; primitive as formal systems although they are much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; less powerful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I dont get this.
</em><br>
<p>Apparently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If sets are a subset of the set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all formal systems why are there more sets than there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are formal systems.
</em><br>
<p>I said that set theory is a subset of the set of formal systems, not
<br>
that sets are a subset of the set of all formal systems. As for sets
<br>
themselves, well, there are far more entities talked about by formal
<br>
systems than there are formal systems -- just the reals outnumber the
<br>
formal systems even though a fairly simple formal system is all you
<br>
need to capture the reals.
<br>
<p>I think you need to get a better background in the area before having
<br>
this discussion -- it will make it less frustrating for both sides.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely the most primitive entities are also the most numerous.
</em><br>
<p>Nope. Not at all, for the same reason that the Chaitin-Kolmogrov
<br>
information of the set of all integers is tiny compared to that of
<br>
almost all individual integers.
