<p>All formal systems are expressable as finite strings of symbols (by

definition), and thus trivially mappable to integers. QED.
<br>
<p>Do you still need a link? If you don't understand why that's trivially
<br>
so, you might want to re-read about formal systems and about Cantorian
<br>
set theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but in any case i think the level IV
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems. Having not read the Tegmark level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classification paper yet i cannot yet be sure. 
</em><br>
<p>It is literally the set of all formal systems, because it is the set
<br>
of all consistent mathematical systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Either way i see no problem with equating sets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes though.
</em><br>
<p>Well, Tegmark makes the point that if you don't have a consistent
<br>
mathematical system underlying you don't have enough structure to get
<br>
self aware substructures and thus only they can be physically realized
<br>
given his operational definition of &quot;has physical reality&quot;. Of course,
<br>
you might yourself have differing operational definitions of physical
<br>
reality (in Tegmark's definition, a detailed simulation has physical
<br>
reality) but that's another story -- if we're using Tegmark's
<br>
terminology then we should be consistent.
<br>
<p>Of course, if you're going to bring things down to the level of &quot;set&quot;
<br>
you start getting into a much deeper problem. &quot;Sets&quot; don't
<br>
interact. They don't form a structure capable of self aware
<br>
substructures at all. Our universe, for example, is pretty trivially
<br>
observable to not be a set -- it might contain sets, but it is a lot
<br>
richer than that.
<br>
<p>And if you were willing to accept that we aren't in a universe and
<br>
move on to &quot;sets&quot; as your fundamental universes, what sort of set
<br>
theory are you going to adopt as &quot;fundamental&quot;? After all, in some set
<br>
theories, you get the axiom of choice, in some you don't. In some, the
<br>
continuum hypothesis is an axiom, in some it isn't. The list goes on
<br>
and on.
<br>
<p>Sets, you see, aren't as primitive as formal systems at all, even
<br>
though they are much less powerful, just as integers aren't as
<br>
primitive as formal systems although they are much less powerful.
<br>
<p>(You can, of course, express formal systems as sets just as you can
<br>
express them as integers (and just as you can express integers as sets
<br>
for that matter) but without the external interpretation of your
<br>
representational system there isn't much &quot;there&quot; there. In the end,
<br>
formal systems are the most primitive object...)
