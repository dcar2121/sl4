Hi,
<br>
<p>About SAG.  I don't want to devote a lot of time to the topic, but I will
<br>
note that, in fact, I did accept a position on SAG's Board of Directors.
<br>
This means that I agreed to provide general &amp; occasional oversight to the
<br>
SAG.
<br>
<p>SAG is a young and still-forming organization -- it hasn't really achieved
<br>
anything yet, which isn't surprising given that it's just a few months old.
<br>
<p>I don't like the term &quot;crackpot&quot; -- I think that the SAG is mostly a group
<br>
of &quot;amateur scientists&quot; who are Singularity boosters and want to work toward
<br>
the Singularity as a group rather than doing so as isolated individuals.
<br>
<p>I think it's fine for there to be a host of different Singularity-focused
<br>
organizations.  Let the fittest survive.  Let them all survive and
<br>
prosper.....
<br>
<p>Personally, nearly my time is reserved for my Novamente project and related
<br>
things, but I'm certainly willing to devote a *little* bit of my time to
<br>
helping out any group that's genuinely interested in working toward the
<br>
Singularity.  I'm also loosely involved with John Smart's &quot;Institute for
<br>
Accelerating Change&quot;, for example.  When there are so many Singularity
<br>
groups out there that I can't pay attention to them all -- well, that will
<br>
be a pretty funky time to be living in ;)
<br>
<p>I certainly don't want to see SAG pick on SL4, SL4 pick on SAG, blah blah
<br>
blah.  This kind of &quot;sectarianism&quot; isn't really to anyone's benefit.
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
Ben Goertzel

<em>&gt; Subject: META: Singularity Action Group attempting to recruit SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been notified that Mike Deering of the &quot;Singularity Action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Group&quot; has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been trying to recruit new posters to SL4.  SAG was formed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike Deering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Alan Grimes as an attempted &quot;spoiler&quot; against SIAI, after they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kicked off SL4 for failing to meet posting standards.  As far as I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell, the entire thing is based solely on personal animosity toward me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SAG appears to be a completely crackpot endeavor with no resources, good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas, or intelligent people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since a number of people have apparently had the bright idea of joining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SAG to &quot;spy&quot; on it, I would like to repeat my advice of not feeding their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need for attention.  As I wrote in my last message to the ill-fated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SingularityAction mailing list:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An interesting anecdote:  During Israel's early days, there existed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain terrorist organization.  Mossad infiltrated this organization so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thoroughly that they later found that one in ten members was a Mossad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agent.  Moreover, they later found that the only reason the organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had been staying afloat was that the Mossad agents were the only ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually paying their dues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd thus like to advise everyone not to join organizations unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really, truly believe that the organization will be effective and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something they wish to be part of.  Otherwise, everyone joins a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;to keep an eye on it&quot; and keeps it alive where the effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have died a quiet death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aside from this warning to anyone who may not be aware of SAG's status or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history, I don't believe that anything needs to be done about SAG.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have other things to worry about.  Please pay SAG no mind, and go about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your business.  They are neither good enough to help nor evil enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
