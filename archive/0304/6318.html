</em><br>
<p>I was amazed when I first read this, because I've had thoughts along these
<br>
lines in the past as well. Firstly, let's go to the uber-video-game universe
<br>
where you're completely immersed with your memories of your real-self
<br>
blocked out temporarily, and all you can remember is memories from the game
<br>
(we will probably see such games appear before the end of the century). If
<br>
your character dies in the game, but you are pulled out the instant before
<br>
death and experience no pain (or a minimal amount), but all the other
<br>
players believe that you are indeed dead and gone, then this is definitely
<br>
morally wrong, because presumably some of the other players will feel mental
<br>
anguish at your loss, which is suffering for them, even if their full
<br>
(non-blocked memory) selves consented to let themselves suffer in the game
<br>
world.
<br>
<p>But an even more disturbing idea is this; what about the AIs living within
<br>
the game? When they &quot;die,&quot; they're not pulled out, because they have nowhere
<br>
to go, so perhaps they regenerate (reborn, perhaps) somewhere else. But this
<br>
still leaves the other players and AIs suffering in the loss of their
<br>
comrade, even if ve didn't experience any pain at the time of death.
<br>
<p>What I'm getting at here is, at what point is it morally reprehensible to
<br>
kill an AI in a video game? Most people would just laugh this notion off,
<br>
but I'm serious here. People have spent a lot of time lately debating and
<br>
studying whether video games or movies corrupt us, our children, or whatever
<br>
crap Congressman so-and-so wishes to dredge up to whenever to pass the blame
<br>
whenever some kid somewhere goes berserk and shoots a few other kids /
<br>
teachers. But I don't believe I've heard anyone say it's immoral to kill AIs
<br>
in video games. If an AI has subjective experiences, such as pain when ve
<br>
dies or sorrow when vis partner dies, then I believe it would definitely be
<br>
wrong to kill / harm / control / manipulate ver. I'm not saying that any of
<br>
the AIs in today's video games are experiencing pain, since 1: they're
<br>
mostly all table-driven agents anyone (e.g., if player does X AI does Y),
<br>
and 2: even the most sophisticated AIs don't have nearly enough
<br>
hardware-power to have subjective experiences, and even if they do, to much
<br>
of it is being used up by just generating realistic graphics to allow any
<br>
really sophisticated AIs to exist. The AIs in video games today are
<br>
incredibly stupid, perhaps around the same intelligence level as a bacteria
<br>
or ant at best, but they are getting smarter. I've seen several games in
<br>
which the AIs are able to beg for help, limp around when wounded, or go
<br>
through very painful-looking death-throws when dyeing.
<br>
<p>With really no one other than myself considering such possibilities, I could
<br>
very well see the whole Roman-arena thing happening in the future again.
<br>
I.e., we look back now and say &quot;how could the Romans actually watch and
<br>
enjoy real people being torn to pieces before their very eyes?&quot;, but perhaps
<br>
in the future sentients will say about us &quot;how could the homo sapiens
<br>
sapiens actually watch and enjoy real sentients being torn to pieces before
<br>
their very eyes?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, can anyone prove that we aren't living the last scenario?
</em><br>
<p>Nope, I sure can't, although I'm even inclined to believe that perhaps we
<br>
are in some elaborate game, that would explain why some people seem so
<br>
stupid, and act very predictably and mechanically; even in the future they
<br>
still don't have good video game AIs... ;-p
<br>
<p>If this is a game though, it's certainly a very cruel one. I've been quite
<br>
sick and in the past and it's certainly very painful, something which I
<br>
wouldn't exactly call &quot;entertainment.&quot; Although it's possible that I really
<br>
never was sick, or the Mongol invasion of China or World War II never
<br>
happened, that they were all just &quot;backstaging&quot; set up by the programmers
<br>
(Gods) of the game, but that still doesn't mean there isn't suffering. If I
<br>
stab myself right now, I'm quite confident that I'll feel pain and suffer;
<br>
it's not just some memory implanted there by the God running this game. If
<br>
this is a game, why do we have to suffer? To make it seem &quot;realistic&quot;? Our
<br>
memories are blocked after all, so how would we know what is &quot;realistic&quot; or
<br>
not, other than from what we've learned in the game? For a sentient-created
<br>
intelligence-driven universe, suffering of the magnitude people feel (mental
<br>
and physical) is entirely unnecessary, and this, if for no other reason, is
<br>
a good argument as to why this is the &quot;ultimate reality,&quot; (i.e., we're not
<br>
just in a game, sim, emulation, etc.) because no quasi-moral sentience would
<br>
put people through that.
<br>
<p>If this really were a game, I doubt I'd come back and play it again after I
<br>
die and am &quot;pulled out&quot; of the game, or perhaps I am a game-AI, and will not
<br>
get the chance to be &quot;pulled out&quot;?
