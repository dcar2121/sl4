</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are some of my reactions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I simply think that an intelligence with the capacity to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the state of billions of other intelligences in its head (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; collate and manage those states and the states of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligences' environments and so on and so on) would be many,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many times more complicated than all of the intelligences it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; managing combined. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is certainly a very good point, and must affect anyone's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimate of *when* such a simulation will be possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most difficult point of the paper, and an admittedly difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of Nick Bostrom's thesis, is attempting to gather some idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the amount of compute power necessary.  I believe that Nick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said that one would have to simulate down to the level of atoms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you are saying that it must go beyond that.
</em><br>
<p>No.  Nick said that the computing power for simulating things other
<br>
than human minds was irrelevant.  Or at least, he though it was
<br>
irrelevant enough to leave it out of his essay.  *I* was the one
<br>
suggesting atoms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In just the same way, suppose that you *are* living in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation. Just on what are you basing your intuition concerning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the accuracy of the simulation so far?  Only on your memories, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're obviously under the control of this hyper-intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program.  
</em><br>
<p>Ah, that's a sneaky one.  Hadn't thought of that.
<br>
<p>But again, how much effort/time on the part of that entity would be
<br>
required?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From this and similar arguments it follows that the actual compute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power necessary to render your current experience has been greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exaggerated.
</em><br>
<p>No, what actually follows is that none of us have a clue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moral Issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a not unrelated way, the same thing applies to one's notions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly how much pain was caused by the Mongol invasion of China,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because when it really comes down to it, you can testify about no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's pain but your own.  Suppose that someone you love, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is badly mangled in an automobile accident, and apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergoes great suffering.  Note that at any particular moment you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are actually communicating with this individual, most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testimony as to the person's suffering has to do with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual's memories of that suffering.  Perhaps the only actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering that ever occurs happens only at the precise moments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you are engaging certain of this loved one's faculties, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that at other times, only the *memories* of suffering are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added.
</em><br>
[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt; Therefore not only is this* possibly a near pain-free emulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I'm surprised that theologians haven't used a form of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above argument to enable them to suppose that God did after all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create the best of all possible worlds, vindicating Dr. Pangloss.
</em><br>
<p>You're saying that as long as I didn't actually undergo having my
<br>
spine crushed[1], but only remember it as though I did, it's morally
<br>
OK for a being to have created a universe where I could
<br>
non-experience that?
<br>
<p>I find that completely absurd, sorry.
