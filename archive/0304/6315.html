<em>&gt; Do you reject the idea that one person’s interests can

</em><br>
<em>&gt; think you know the best reason to do so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am not quite seeing the relevance of your line of questioning. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally speaking, persons are not of the same capabilities 
<br>
or potentials and I doubt that they will be.  Thinks may develop 
<br>
such that there is little/no perceived conflict of interest 
<br>
between persons.  That would be great.  But if there is then it 
<br>
is quite possible that one person's interest, say in improving 
<br>
drastically the lot of the world might be more important than 
<br>
another's interest, say in finding the next fix for a drug 
<br>
addiction.
<br>
<p>What does &quot;to do so&quot; refer to in the above paragraph, choosing 
<br>
between different person's interests?  But why should it be up 
<br>
to any external entity to choose?  In any condition of real 
<br>
conflict, assuming both sets of interest are actually ethical, I 
<br>
see no reason why some form of competition for resources to 
<br>
satisfy the interests or some means of bargaining/voting could 
<br>
not be used.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does it matter if someone does so for a reason other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the best reason? Do you understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “disconnect” that can happen in such a case?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Does so what?  I am a bit lost here.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; By what possible mechanism would you determine another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual’s interests? How would you like this to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined in your case? And might the ideal method of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion vary between individuals then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, I don't know what you are about with this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the question is, &quot;Why would active benevolence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow for involuntary suffering?&quot; That's sure not an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest of mine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What isn't, allowing for involuntary suffering?  Perhaps it 
<br>
cannot be removed without also removing a set of very much 
<br>
wanted goods utterly in keeping with Friendliness.  I simply do 
<br>
not have sufficient arrogance to claim or in depth understanding 
<br>
to claim boldly that it can and will be removed in all 
<br>
circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Benevolence isn't supposed to have unintended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences. And the whole ideal of “rejecting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that one person’s interests can ever be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important than another’s” is that each person’s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;interests&quot; are theirs alone. That’s what human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benevolence is. I can’t wish any other definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benevolence on anyone. Do you want a world where any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind can? Why would you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Our world is full of benevolence in intentions having unintended 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences.  Mainly this occurs when we attempt to muck with 
<br>
each other &quot;for our own good&quot; with or without permission.  I am 
<br>
not at all convinced that an SAI can always, should always or 
<br>
will always choose to do such involuntary mucking about.
<br>
<p>I don't want a world where any mind can impose its notion of 
<br>
benevolence on me against my will.
