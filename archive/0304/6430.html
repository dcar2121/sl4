</em><br>
<p>But a *single* Level IV Process could conceivably contain uncountably many 
<br>
universes - aleph-one, aleph-two, or beyond - while still being just one 
<br>
formal system according to your enumeration.  There may be uncountably 
<br>
many universes contained in other Level IV Processes - for example, a 
<br>
Process might contain universes that run on reals or fields of reals.
<br>
<p>Actually, Bayesia itself appears to be made up of fields of real and 
<br>
complex numbers, but in a way that leads to only countably many universes. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the measure of these countably many universes appears to be 
<br>
divided up among a finite number of distinguishable computational 
<br>
processes at any finite time.  After any finite amount of time within any 
<br>
finite volume of space, there are a finite number of different possible 
<br>
material configurations, a finite causal history (past light cone) for any 
<br>
spacetime event, a finite cognitive embodiment for any distinguishable 
<br>
thinking entity, and a finite number of finite subjective experiences that 
<br>
are possible given a finite thinking time.  Even if time grows without 
<br>
upper bound, the t coordinate always has a finite value at any given 
<br>
point; it never assumes a specific number called &quot;infinity&quot;.  Though 
<br>
perhaps chaotic perpetual inflation means that any universe has an 
<br>
infinite past history from &quot;before&quot; its Big Bang... still, it doesn't look 
<br>
like this materially alters the point.
<br>
<p>Thus, Bayesia consists of datums of possible diversity aleph-two (the 
<br>
quantum fields), which interact in such way as to create a countable 
<br>
number of universes, with their measure divided up among an enumerable 
<br>
(but perhaps unbounded) number of distinguishable computational processes. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps much the same relation would likely hold of any Level IV Process 
<br>
capable of containing conscious observers, regardless of how high an order 
<br>
of infinity the number of universes was.  And if so, perhaps we should 
<br>
just expect to find ourselves in one of the simpler or most commonly 
<br>
occurring Processes that gives rise to conscious observers, without having 
<br>
an anthropic prejudice in favor of explanations that predict &quot;finitely&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;countably&quot; or &quot;uncountably&quot; many observers.
