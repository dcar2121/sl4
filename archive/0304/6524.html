</em><br>
<p>The reason i am more concerned with Hell worlds than
<br>
Apothesis worlds is that in Apothesis worlds the
<br>
sentients have it easy, they dont need to suffer. Of
<br>
course we can still empathasize with beings that dont
<br>
suffer but thats a bit of a waste of our empathy. As
<br>
humans it is natural for us to react more to those who
<br>
do suffer, and to extend our sympathies most to those
<br>
who also suffer the most.
<br>
<p>Assuming FAI, or the proliferations of FAI which have
<br>
a same basic ethical system NOT alien to humankind,
<br>
are moreorless ubiquitous throughout the multiverse.
<br>
Then the subjective probability of you quickly jumping
<br>
into an Apotheosis state if you are already unlucky
<br>
enough to be in a Hell state is very VERY high.
<br>
But but but...when i talk about &quot;the cusp of
<br>
infinitesimalism&quot; im not joking. Im well aware of the
<br>
ridiculously low probability involved subjectively in
<br>
remaining for any extended length of time in a Hell
<br>
world. Those sentients on the very cusp however, who
<br>
follow a trajectory which a hypothesized devil would
<br>
delight in i.e. those that necessarily experiance
<br>
indefinate extended (and heightened) pain and
<br>
suffering, are just as real as You and I. The fact
<br>
that we are aware of the existance of them is indeed
<br>
shocking. Its especially shocking to learn that there
<br>
is absolutely nothing we can do about it, just as the
<br>
word &quot;necessary&quot; implies.
<br>
<p>Given what i have said above how our empathy works:
<br>
used towards those that suffer most. Far future AIs
<br>
(assuming they havent already abandoned their human
<br>
empathy anchors) are going to have some obvious
<br>
problems with this &quot;necessary-ness&quot;. In their time and
<br>
space, all sentients around them will presumably be
<br>
living a relative bliss (Apotheosis state as you call
<br>
it) and its very difficult to see a need for local-use
<br>
of empathy in such a state. Why would you need to care
<br>
about someone who you already know is in absolutely no
<br>
danger?
<br>
<p>I suggest that in order for these future beings to
<br>
keep their anthropic empathy they will have to target
<br>
it elsewhere, to those beings that actually suffer.
<br>
And i see the obvious target of this as the necessary
<br>
cusp of suffering implied by the Level IV multiverse.
<br>
All such worlds would be accessible by simulation, so
<br>
the need for advanced beings to express their
<br>
heightened humanlike empathy may end up becoming quite
<br>
a morbid pastime, as beings try to simulate the
<br>
feeling of being in a Hell world and experiencing
<br>
intense pain. [Aside: Can there be such a thing as the
<br>
qualia of infinite pain felt by a consciousness in a
<br>
single moment? We had better hope not!!] Im beginning
<br>
to think that at some stage, when advanced sentients
<br>
finally reach the state of maximum local apotheosis,
<br>
it might be a very wise idea for them to abandon their
<br>
empathy, at least as we know it in the human form.
<br>
This could be an unnecessary sacrafice of at least one
<br>
quality of humanness though so im still in favour of
<br>
extended ignorance holidays :-)
<br>
<p>Simon.
