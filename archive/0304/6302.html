</em><br>
<p>Well, our &quot;pesky little human minds&quot; are what we are stuck with 
<br>
for now.  That last bit bothers me due to the negative 
<br>
conditioning of being raised with the continuous refrain, &quot;The 
<br>
ways of God are mysterious and cannot be understand and should 
<br>
not be questioned by puny human minds.&quot;  I rebelled against it 
<br>
then and I still do.
<br>
<p>However, I can see possible ways that an FAI could be in charge 
<br>
of a &quot;universe&quot;, or apparent reality at least, where suffering 
<br>
still does exist.  One possibility is that the universe is 
<br>
tailored for the natural evolution of beings who transcend their 
<br>
evolved limits.  The suffering is there as natural consequence 
<br>
of the type of evolved beings and the nature of the laws 
<br>
governing that world.  It is also a goad to further development. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure the FAI could just cook up beings but perhaps those lack 
<br>
some critical capacities that evolved intelligences have or 
<br>
eventually developed that the FAI cannot directly create.  For 
<br>
that matter perhaps we are the working out of the steps within 
<br>
the mind of the FAI.
<br>
<p>Ultimately of course this leads nowhere.  At some time/place 
<br>
there had to exist a species that got to a FAI without one being 
<br>
present already.  Unless of course the FAI transcends space-time 
<br>
and becomes involved in its own becoming.  Perhaps it builds 
<br>
sims to look for the steps that could have led to less 
<br>
suffering/death along the way to Singularity.   Those sims look 
<br>
feel perfectly real to those within them.
<br>
<p>Another possibility is that those not ready to participate in or 
<br>
reap the benefits of Singularity are watched over in some way 
<br>
(popped into a VR perhaps) where they have full freedom to work 
<br>
out all their tendencies and eventually grow beyond them.  This 
<br>
would require a VR and/or [virtual] reincarnation.  But it is 
<br>
one possible answer to what a FAI might consider as a way for 
<br>
human sentients to both have their freedom and desired 
<br>
self-evolution without being a real (versus virtual) danger to 
<br>
themselves or others.
<br>
<p>So I agree with the general notion that there are more ways of a 
<br>
FAI being present with and allowing suffering than can be easily 
<br>
be disposed of.
