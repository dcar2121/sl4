</em><br>
<p>(Note:  This is in reference to the author's afterword from &quot;Non-Player 
<br>
Character&quot;.)
<br>
<p>By selectively considering your responses to situations that, while 
<br>
&quot;theoretically&quot; possible, are only likely in fiction, you can end up 
<br>
distorting your mentally precomputed reflexes away from the real world. 
<br>
There are real anomalies - but not the ones from fiction, and considering 
<br>
fiction can subtly train you to mishandle real anomalies.  Now it is 
<br>
perhaps better to be an SF fan who knows how to handle every kind of 
<br>
fictional situation from magical closets to temporal paradoxes, than to 
<br>
panic and have your mind shut down when anomalies are encountered.  In 
<br>
that sense SF training may be useful.  But the real world is fundamentally 
<br>
different from fiction; it runs on different rules.  A real temporal 
<br>
paradox need not send you on wacky time-travel adventures; the very first 
<br>
prototype time device could tear a hole in space and wipe out human 
<br>
civilization instantly.  It'd make for a boring story, but that's no 
<br>
reason to assume it can't happen.  It's that kind of subtly biased 
<br>
precomputation, precomputation based on imagining the wrong worlds, that 
<br>
can lead you to train yourself into the wrong reaction.
<br>
<p>Another problem: if you imagine possible &quot;rational&quot; explanations for 
<br>
finding a portal in your closet, you may start thinking that it's more 
<br>
likely to happen - after all, you thought of all these possible rational 
<br>
ways it could happen, right?  That is the flaw in reasoning by abduction 
<br>
from false hypotheses.  You have all these links in your mind leading to 
<br>
explaining the anomaly of a portal in your closet, but those links are 
<br>
likely to cut across the grain of real anomalies because you will not 
<br>
*actually* find a portal in your closet.
<br>
<p>Try keeping track of how many times people casually reason from fictional 
<br>
evidence - &quot;Brave New World&quot; cited in discussions on cloning, &quot;The Matrix&quot; 
<br>
in discussions of AI, &quot;the Borg&quot; in discussions of human-machine 
<br>
interfaces.  Humans don't have strong safeguards to prevent reasoning from 
<br>
fictional evidence; we know the particular story isn't true, but we easily 
<br>
pick up our concepts, our categories, the way we chunk the world, by 
<br>
generalizing concepts from fictional experiences.  Generalizing your 
<br>
categories from fictional evidence is just as much a mistake as treating 
<br>
&quot;Brave New World&quot; as a history book.
