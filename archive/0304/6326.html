<p>As it happens, I am just about to publish a novel, &quot;Permutated Fishy&quot;, 
<br>
which will be sure to *captivate* you (if I may be so immodest)! I 
<br>
present an excerpt for the enjoyment of SL4 readers:
<br>
<p>&quot; ... and only _then_ did Bob's twenty-seven billion, three hundred 
<br>
sixty-eight million, five hundred thirty-three thousand, six hundred 
<br>
ninety-ninth neuron depolarize, as a result of the dendritic inputs it 
<br>
had recently received from his one hundred and ten billion, four 
<br>
hundred eight million, seventy-one thousand, two hundred eighty-first 
<br>
neuron, and his two hundred and one billion ... &quot;
<br>
<p>Intrigued? Here's the jacket blurb:
<br>
<p>&quot;Master of descriptive fiction Emil Gilliam retells an age-old tale of 
<br>
pain, rejection and humiliation as never told before! The hapless Bob 
<br>
has just been slapped on the head with a trout by an enigmatic woman 
<br>
known only as Alice. As the milliseconds tick, this 
<br>
action-potential-packed thriller grippingly explores Bob's dark Oedipal 
<br>
impulses of anger, lust and hunger, neuron by neuron. Does Bob have 
<br>
qualia? Does Alice? Does the trout? And can anyone at all mention 
<br>
'qualia' in an SL4 thread without officially killing it? Join Bob on an 
<br>
amazing journey all the way to the electrifying, heart-pounding, 
<br>
jaw-clenching end ... *if you dare*.&quot;
<br>
<p>Soon to be available wherever such books are sold.
<br>
<p>- Emil Gilliam
