<em>&gt; As a Peircean pragmatist, my question is: What measurement could I

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There are a few possible answers to this. In the spirit of
<br>
multiversalism, I will give them all. :-P
<br>
<p>Firstly, the existence of other universes may affect probabilities via
<br>
anthropic arguments. For example, you could argue that if there is only
<br>
one universe, it leaves unexplained the coincidence that this one
<br>
universe allows for observers. (I don't think that this argument works.)
<br>
<p>If all possible universes exist, that could affect our probabilities for
<br>
what the universe is like. We should find that the universe is &quot;the most
<br>
generic one that is consistent with our observations&quot;, and so on. In this
<br>
way, the idea can be falsified (probabilistically).
<br>
<p>Secondly, even if we can never tell the difference, the potential
<br>
inhabitants of the other universes can. If people in other universes
<br>
don't count, why would (say) Belgians count, if I never had anything to
<br>
do with them in my entire life? :-) Or, to use a more correct example:
<br>
how about aliens who live so far away we can never affect them or be
<br>
affected by them?
<br>
<p>Thirdly, I don't need to believe that other universes Really Exist in any
<br>
absolute sense to speak of them. Instead of elementary particles, there
<br>
could be tiny quantum gnomes at the Planck scale manipulating everything
<br>
that happens, and we could never tell the difference. We still choose to
<br>
speak of elementary particles, since they're the simplest explanation for
<br>
what seems to be going on. In the same way, the other universes play a
<br>
role in our (in my opinion) simplest explanation of what's going on, so
<br>
it makes sense to think of them as existing. (The two simplest options
<br>
are that nothing exists and that everything exists, and the first one has
<br>
been empirically disproven.)

&quot;Why does it need to be an either/or situation: probably there is both
 something, and nothing.  The something just stands out more.&quot;
