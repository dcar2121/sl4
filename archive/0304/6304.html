</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you really believe suffering should be alleviated?  I think it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incredible motivator (I personally have always found that I work harder when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my back is against the wall).  It is the ultimate object lesson.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael LaTorra already said almost everything I wanted to say, and it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remains only to point out that while you might choose to regard certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms of suffering as building character, you cannot make that choice for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, because Michael wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Low level suffering, such as anxiety and frustration, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed be motivators.  And these psychological forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering may, as you said John, be around in some form forever.
</em><br>
<p>May we hope not!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But they can be mitigated. And they are not necessary preconditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for motivating oneself or others.  There are other means.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  All our intuitions have been built up by evolution,
<br>
and from my point of view, it seems that we all too easily
<br>
fail to reach for the grandest optimum, and imagine too
<br>
eagerly constraints for which no evidence exists.  We should
<br>
assume that in every way we can have our cake and eat it too,
<br>
until it is proved somehow it's not possible.
<br>
<p>But no one, IMO, has said it as well as David Pearce:
<br>
<p>www.hedweb.com
<br>
<p>David's essay is one of the most difficult I've ever read.
<br>
Most sentences are of the form &quot;Whereas X, it follows that Y&quot;,
<br>
where each of X and Y are quite formidable extensions (and more
<br>
radical paraphrasings) of what I might have only glimpsed
<br>
earlier.
<br>
<p>But next to cryonics, &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot; is the
<br>
greatest moral revolution I've experienced in my entire life.
<br>
<p>Lee
