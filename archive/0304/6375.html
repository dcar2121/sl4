</em><br>
<p>Yes and no.
<br>
<p>All the different regions like our observable universe can be seen as
<br>
starting at the same time and evolving at the same speed. (The energy
<br>
density is homogeneous in the &quot;internal&quot; space and time coordinates, the
<br>
ones where the universe-bubble (&quot;universe&quot;, &quot;thermalized region&quot;) is
<br>
spatially infinite.) This means that far-away parts of the bubble will
<br>
become more and more boring in the very long term, just like our part.
<br>
<p>So while, say, a world much like Middle-Earth really exists in this
<br>
theory, it (and you) will have secondlawed to oblivion by the time you
<br>
can get there. :-)
<br>
<p>That's the 'yes' part of the answer, with a few reservations: there is no
<br>
one moment you can point to as being the &quot;end&quot;, and we might be able to
<br>
keep alive anyway (in a &quot;Dyson scenario&quot;, or if there's a way around the
<br>
second law).
<br>
<p>The 'no' part of the answer is described somewhere in the paper &quot;Many
<br>
worlds in one&quot; by Garriga and Vilenkin, found here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0102010">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/0102010</a>
<br>
<p>The second law is only statistical: entropy will actually go down in very
<br>
rare cases. This means that for any length of time, there is a very small
<br>
but finitesimal (nonzero, &quot;finite&quot;) probability that a civilization will
<br>
be able to survive for that length of time due to thermal fluctuations.
<br>
The longer the time, the smaller the probability; but if there are
<br>
infinitely many civilizations, then infinitely many of them will be alive
<br>
at any time, even though almost all will have died out. In that sense,
<br>
the universe lives forever, fuelled by extreme improbability.
<br>
<p>I think this leads to something similar to what people have called
<br>
&quot;quantum immortality&quot;: if the many-worlds interpretation is true and if,
<br>
whenever you die in some worlds and live in some worlds, your
<br>
consciousness is always continuous with one of those worlds where you
<br>
stay alive, then a consequence is that your consciousness never stops,
<br>
and you will experience more and more improbable events that cause you to
<br>
stay alive. Something similar would be true in the infinite universe
<br>
(&quot;big universe immortality&quot;, maybe): you would always live on as one of
<br>
those versions of you (in different regions of the universe) that happen
<br>
to stay alive.
<br>
<p>I think this is nonsense, though, based on a wrong view of identity,
<br>
probability, and so on. Those who believe their probability measure is
<br>
redistributed among their surviving copies should now believe in this
<br>
silliness whether they believe in the MWI or not.
<br>
<p>A corollary of &quot;quantum immortality&quot; (&quot;big universe immortality&quot;) is
<br>
&quot;quantum suicide&quot; (&quot;big universe suicide&quot;): if you set up a quantum
<br>
experiment that kills you unless you win the lottery, you will find
<br>
you're in one of those worlds (parts of the universe) where you won the
<br>
lottery. If this is true, then you could also distinguish experimentally
<br>
between Copenhagen and many-worlds (between a small and an infinite
<br>
universe) by selective suicide, though this wouldn't convince other
<br>
people. (If you did this to someone else, it would be &quot;quantum murder&quot;,
<br>
as in the case of Schrödinger's cat.)
<br>
<p>Again, I think this is nonsense; *please* do not try anything like this
<br>
at home. Some people have a reckless disregard for their (or their cat's)
<br>
probability measure.
<br>
<p>Hope this hasn't given anyone unsafe ideas, 
<br>
Nus
