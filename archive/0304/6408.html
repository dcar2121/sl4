<em>&gt; I find myself more worried by this sort of increased political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention than pleased.  Especially I find talk of giving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of humanity a say very disturbing. The vast majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humankind today is not even literate and certainly mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational.  If even the literate majority kill things like stem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell research what do you think they would do toward technology that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might make them and all humans obsolete or hardly like themselves in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many ways within a generation or two?
</em><br>
<p>I think the talk matters only in a localized sense. It may be possible
<br>
for a time to hold back the development of certain technologies. It
<br>
is certainly not possible to do it for long without killing all
<br>
sentient life on the planet. A sufficiently sustained Luddite effort
<br>
with participation from enough of the planet's population could cost
<br>
us decades or centuries, but could not ultimately hold back what is
<br>
happening.
<br>
<p>The question is not whether we will end up building the sorts of
<br>
technologies we are discussing. Ultimately if the human race survives
<br>
we will build them, whether anyone dislikes the idea or not. The
<br>
question is whether the Luddite meme spreads far and fast enough to
<br>
make the transition worthlessly slow and bloody instead of smooth and
<br>
generally beneficial for everyone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe it will be pretty.  And if such does come to pass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I believe is quite likely, will all of us happily accept that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority or powers that be have spoken and roll up our dreams
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and work and wait for death to overtake us?  Or will we choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently?  Will we have the will and the means to choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently when (not if) such a time comes?
</em><br>
<p>The U.S. might be willing to end all stem cell research, but other
<br>
countries have not and will not. Some places may ban certain kinds of
<br>
research, but it unlikely that such efforts will have global
<br>
success. If we are interested in such things, we can always find a
<br>
home to do the work. The question is whether or not things get
<br>
needlessly delayed by such machinations.
