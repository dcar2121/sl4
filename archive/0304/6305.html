</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think that's the right attitude.  Definitely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I can see possible ways that an FAI could be in charge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a &quot;universe&quot;, or apparent reality at least, where suffering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still does exist.  One possibility is that the universe is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tailored for the natural evolution of beings who transcend their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved limits.  The suffering is there as natural consequence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the type of evolved beings and the nature of the laws 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governing that world.  It is also a goad to further development. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're almost starting to sound as harsh as Jehovah.
<br>
<p>Now, seriously, if you were anywhere near omniscient, just what
<br>
would you *do* for your children?  Make them suffer for 40 years
<br>
wandering in the desert to &quot;goad them&quot; into further development
<br>
or because you felt bound to &quot;natural laws&quot;?
<br>
<p>Pardon the presumption, but I know EXACTLY what you would do,
<br>
Samantha.  You'd do exactly what I would do, namely, place
<br>
those other individuals on their own paths of personal 
<br>
evolution to bring them up to your level at the highest
<br>
possible speed.
<br>
<p>And for anyone about to surrender to the old notion of &quot;some
<br>
things just take time&quot;, I find such an attitude harkening
<br>
back to really primitive times.  An SI could work with me
<br>
to bring me (or my duplicates) up to fantastically higher
<br>
levels within hours.  And for those versions of me whose job
<br>
it is to stay at 2003 technology, no reason for them not to
<br>
exult in the knowledge of the existence of those versions
<br>
racing ever faster ahead.
