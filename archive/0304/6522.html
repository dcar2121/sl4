It's easy to think of a situation of sacrificing a few lives to save many.
<br>
Perhaps a well-armed terrorist group has a nuclear device in the sewers
<br>
under New York, inaccessible to the FAI's resources.  Sending in SWAT to
<br>
take them out is calculated to result in the loss of 5 good men.
<br>
<p>But that's too easy, try this one.  Three people are dying; one from a
<br>
failing heart, two from failed kidneys.  A healthy person who happens to
<br>
match their blood and tissue types can be sacrificed to save the other 3.
<br>
In making this decision, does it matter whether the healthy person is a
<br>
convicted killer and the other 3 are nobel prize winners, or perhaps vice
<br>
versa?
<br>
<p>This can go on forever with what-if's, such as, how many monkeys is it ok to
<br>
sacrifice in order to save 1 human life?  I don't know that there are any
<br>
easy answers, but I'm curious as to how a FAI might look at it.

</em><br>

would
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  If so, then if it could save a million people by sacrificing 999,999
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It's very hard to see a situation where a mature FAI would be faced with
<br>
that decision.  And my own impulse is to reply:  &quot;Of course it would.&quot;
<br>
The human injunction that 'the ends do not justify the means' guards
<br>
against our fallibility and our warped political emotions.  Change that,
<br>
and what's left is only the lives.
<br>
<p>But perhaps an FAI would say differently.  I can also see an irreplaceable
<br>
value in an FAI not killing anyone, ever, throughout the whole of human
<br>
history.  I'm just not sure that value is greater than the value of a
<br>
human life.
