Well, since it seems to be practice to mention that one has joined
<br>
this list, &quot;Hello!&quot;
<br>
<p>I'm a dilettante with a strong interest in the sort of issues
<br>
discussed in Extropian/Transhuman circles. Unfortunately, I'm not as
<br>
well informed as I'd like to be -- I know too little about far too
<br>
many things. One of my big goals for the future is to learn a lot more.
<br>
<p>To make this message more useful to readers, I'll mention several
<br>
neat articles I've read in the last few days:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993638">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993638</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment with adult stem cells has cured mice suffering with a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;form of multiple sclerosis, say Italian researchers. Almost a third
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the mice recovered completely from paralysis of their back legs,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rest all showed substantial improvement.
<br>
<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=570&amp;ncid=753&amp;e=5&amp;u=/nm/20030416/sc_nm/science_aging_dc">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=570&amp;ncid=753&amp;e=5&amp;u=/nm/20030416/sc_nm/science_aging_dc</a><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two teams of scientists reported on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wednesday they found a genetic mutation that causes children to die
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of old age, and said their research offered both a way to find a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cure and insights into normal aging.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000F1EDD-B48A-1E90-8EA5809EC5880000">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000F1EDD-B48A-1E90-8EA5809EC5880000</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a copy of you reading this article? [...]  The simplest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and most popular cosmological model today predicts that you have a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twin in a galaxy about 10^(10^28) meters from here. This distance
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is so large that it is beyond astronomical, but that does not make
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your doppelganger any less real. The estimate is derived from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elementary probability and does not even assume speculative modern
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics, merely that space is infinite (or at least sufficiently
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large) in size and almost uniformly filled with matter, as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observations indicate.
<br>
<p>This last article is the latest output from Max Tegmark, this time in
<br>
the form of an informative lay article in SciAm summarizing what we
<br>
know at the moment on the notion of parallel worlds. It covers both
<br>
that which we're reasonably sure about and that which we aren't. I
<br>
think Max's &quot;Is `The Theory of Everything' Merely the Ultimate
<br>
Ensemble Theory?&quot;  paper, which I first read some time ago, is one of
<br>
the bigger mind-twisters out there, but the fact that an infinite
<br>
universe implies infinite numbers of me (shades of Borges' &quot;Library of
<br>
Babel&quot; only with Hubble volumes instead of print volumes) was
<br>
something I hadn't heard about before now, never mind how obvious it
<br>
is in retrospect, and is still pretty damn mint-twisting.
