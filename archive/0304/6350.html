</em><br>
<p>It would be better to say that the local measured relative speed of an 
<br>
object never exceeds the local measured relative speed of light in a 
<br>
vacuum.  Under Special Relativity alone, with spacetime universally flat, 
<br>
the measured speed of light is the same everywhere you look - 186,000 
<br>
miles per second; it's not just a good idea, it's the law.  Under General 
<br>
Relativity spacetime is not flat; it can be curved and, in fact, can be 
<br>
expanding.  Imagine a balloon covered in raisins.  As you blow up the 
<br>
balloon, the raisins get farther apart; this is inflation.  The local 
<br>
speed of any raisin can never exceed c, but it's also possible that if two 
<br>
raisins start out 186,000 miles apart and motionless relative to each 
<br>
other, a ray of light starting from one raisin to the other will not have 
<br>
reached the second raisin one second later because of the expansion of 
<br>
space in the meanwhile.  If you pick two sufficiently distant points on 
<br>
the balloon, it may be that even if the two raisins are motionless 
<br>
relative to each other, a ray of light from one can never reach the other 
<br>
because the balloon is inflating too fast.
<br>
<p>Or that's the simple explanation.  I think the real explanation would have 
<br>
to be phrased in terms of spacetime intervals rather than space and time, 
<br>
since as we all know, &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot; are not basic physical quantities 
<br>
but only things that we attempt to measure using rulers and clocks, which 
<br>
are themselves complete physical objects that change according to the real 
<br>
Einsteinian rules.  The invariants are the relativistic quantities, which 
<br>
are prior to any separate space and time; our interpretation of &quot;length&quot; 
<br>
as &quot;shrinking&quot; in a fast spaceship is really a statement about what 
<br>
happens to the relativistic physical objects called rulers under various 
<br>
circumstances.  So rather than talking about an &quot;expanding distance&quot; 
<br>
between two raisins, or claiming that they are &quot;186,000 miles apart&quot;, or 
<br>
that they are &quot;motionless&quot; relative to each other, or that a photon has 
<br>
not reached a location &quot;one second&quot; later, we should really talk about 
<br>
physical rulers laid between two physical clocks and photons traveling 
<br>
between them.  I don't know how to write that description because I don't 
<br>
know the math, just the qualitative explanation given to nonphysicists.  I 
<br>
don't even know how to define the relative motionlessness of two objects 
<br>
in an expanding universe because I don't know how &quot;motion&quot; is being 
<br>
measured.  Special relativity and general relativity are being obeyed, 
<br>
obviously, but I don't know what it looks like in clocks and rulers.  Any 
<br>
physicists hanging around?
<br>
<p>Leonardo Wild has been asked not to post to SL4 for one month due to 
<br>
failing to meet SL4 standards of scientific literacy.
