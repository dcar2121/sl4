<p>The Laws of Nature are all habits. When the universe was &quot;created&quot; those 
<br>
habits didn't exist yet, they were being created as well and then, after 
<br>
time, they became Laws. This, in any case, is how most laws are made 
<br>
(except in these days of upside down logic where laws are made by 
<br>
lawyers who are paid to make laws because that's another way to make money).
<br>
<p>The Theory of Morphic Resonance or Morphogenetic Fields seems to explain 
<br>
this, though since it really goes against most of what is being believed 
<br>
today, Sheldrake's theory is still looked upon as a &quot;scientific heresy&quot; 
<br>
(read: non-accepted paradigm), especially since Rupert Sheldrake has 
<br>
since then gone on to write about angels and intuition as scientifically 
<br>
acceptable ... (?)
<br>
<p>Not taking this into account, if you realize that we view the Laws of 
<br>
Nature as something that always existed, we are automatically implying 
<br>
that the universe was there as the background for those laws. But if it 
<br>
was only just being formed, those laws could not have existed yet: they 
<br>
were also being created. It is not theory that makes the universe, but 
<br>
the other way round, and if our theories don't fit reality, then there 
<br>
must be something wrong with reality ... ups, with our &quot;perception&quot; of 
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>Reality is what is being reported to the system, and it is also only as 
<br>
good as the sensory organs can perceive it (or the mind to understand 
<br>
what is being perceived).
<br>
<p>Best,
