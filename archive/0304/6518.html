Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I believe it's OK for me to be simulated.  It really doesn't bother me at
<br>
all.  I basically agree with Lee's intuitive feelings on this.
<br>
<p>What am I?  An intricately structured cluster of patterns; a spark of
<br>
awareness.  I like the patterns, I like the awareness.  Simulate away!!
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Corbinian morality, are stuck in the desert of the real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;I mean, you're the *only* person you know who believes it's okay to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;simulated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, I'm sure that there are many others!  A lot of people just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; haven't considered the question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, maybe, but the fact is that you're the only one I know of on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians, SL4, or wta-talk lists, and moreover, there isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your position, or even leaning toward it.  Everyone you know who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered the question seems to not only reject your position, but to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reject it strongly and definitely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's difficult to understand why anyone would be against the idea,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it has to do with us being wallpaper modeled after evolved people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than an artificial mind delicately constructed for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sole purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of giving assent to being simulated.  Evolved people are generally very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly against the idea of being simulated, and that's reflected in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wallpaper versions of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I think that it has to do with too little faith in others:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they automatically assume that a simulator has little better to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do than torture them.  Another source is a perverted utility curve:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they cannot bring themselves to imagine extreme pleasure as easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as they imagine extreme pain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, our originals would have allowed someone to &quot;simulate&quot; them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'd just have required that it be in much better conditions, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to the real world and so on.  The indicator that shows you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really a simulation is that you don't feel a desire to ask for any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things, even though you could very easily do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't need to have faith in the simulators.  You could make your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consent *conditional* on them treating you nicely.  You could make your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consent conditional on your winning the lottery.  If you were inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone who didn't care, it would make no difference to the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runtime you got.  And if the simulator did care, you would win the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lottery.  A win-win proposition, except for your implanted wish not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rock the boat.  You could even demand that you be allowed into the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world as a full citizen.  If you weren't in an FAI it would make no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference, and if you were in an FAI you would get your wish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way our originals would have thought.  It's perfectly straightforward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian decision theory with respect to their goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, it is a bit odd, isn't it, that you were born into a First World
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation, that you got a comfortable job, and that you lived a comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, with no really painful catastrophes in it?  That you never ran into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything awful enough to make you reconsider your consent?  Most people -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or at least, most of the people you see around you - are not so lucky.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Now, how likely is that?  Isn't it just a little bit... contrived?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are starting to scare me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if you don't like it, you can always ask to be let out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Maybe...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;...maybe you should just ask to be let out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;It can't hurt, can it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes it can!  I don't want to cause no trouble.  (Hear that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nice simulator?)  You just do whatever you are doing now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything is *fine* in here.  I'm quite happy and am delighted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at your exceptional thoughtfulness and kindness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *Sigh.*  Constructs.  I should know better than to try...
