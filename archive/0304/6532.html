<p><p>I can't speak for Eliezer, but it seems that doing this would reinforce some
<br>
of the existing underlying problems with discussions of the topic.  The
<br>
problem is less that people need to be exposed to the ideas of AI, than that
<br>
they need to have their heads in the right conceptual place to even begin
<br>
considering it at a meaningful level.  Getting people to change how they
<br>
conceptualize the world at a very fundamental level is the hard part in my
<br>
opinion.
<br>
<p>One of the biggest problems I've found in discussing many of the ideas I've
<br>
been working on is that the vast majority of people are lacking the
<br>
background fundamentals and conceptual context to see conclusions and
<br>
consequences that are &quot;obvious&quot; to me.  And it isn't just a matter of simple
<br>
tutorial to get people up to speed, the amount of background and conceptual
<br>
understanding to make much of what I am talking about transparent is not
<br>
trivial to convey and much (most?) of it isn't even directly related to AI.
<br>
Consequently, I never delve into the real theoretical space that I'm
<br>
*actually* working in, because people generally aren't ready for it.  I
<br>
don't have the time and most people don't have the attention span.
<br>
<p>What it sounds like Eli is talking about writing is an immense tome that is
<br>
intended to provide the background conceptual space in which AI needs to be
<br>
considered.  This is very different than writing a book *on* AI, and a much
<br>
more crucial resource for people interested in understanding AI in my
<br>
opinion.  You can't show people how to run if they haven't even figured out
<br>
how to crawl.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3) Pursuing a PhD in AI? (which would force you to do #2)
</em><br>
<p><p>A rather inefficient use of resources as I see it, and I suspect other
<br>
people will as well.  Not that it isn't useful, just that it isn't an
<br>
optimal usage of time if you are in a hurry.
