<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;But as for being morally &quot;okay&quot;, no, suffering of any form is

inadmissible (contradicting rationalizations for suffering in another
<br>
thread), including our displeasure at having apparently undergone sorrow.
<br>
<p>I just have to jump in here . . . .
<br>
<p>Suppose I'm playing a fantasy role-playing game (Dungeons &amp; Dragons or
<br>
something similar) and one of my characters dies a horrible death.  Is this
<br>
morally wrong?
<br>
<p>Suppose it's twenty years in the future and I'm playing the newest total
<br>
immersion version of this game.  I'm booted out of the game once it's
<br>
apparent that my character is about to die horribly but everyone else &quot;sees&quot;
<br>
me die horribly.  Is this morally wrong?
<br>
<p>Suppose that for the excitement/thrill/entertainment or for some learning
<br>
experience that I'm willing to accept experiencing some shadow of that
<br>
horrible death.  It won't kill me or permanently damage me but it will allow
<br>
me to stay in the game until the last possible instant, try to strive to
<br>
accomplish nearly impossible things, have a great and realistic death scene,
<br>
etc.  Is this morally wrong?  There's certainly might be (minor) suffering
<br>
involved here but it's suffering that I've chosen . . . .
<br>
<p>Suppose that for the ultimate in realism and to truly &quot;live the game&quot;, I've
<br>
decided to accept the temporary blockage of all outside-game knowledge.
<br>
Until I &quot;die&quot; inside the game, I won't remember/know about anything outside
<br>
the game but once I &quot;die&quot;, I will go on living my normal life outside the
<br>
game.  Is this morally wrong (Assume that we're advanced enough that there
<br>
is no way in which in-game events can harm, much less traumatize, my
<br>
outside-game self)?
<br>
<p>Now, can anyone prove that we aren't living the last scenario?
<br>
<p>Note: This can also explain Eliezer's asking to be let out of the &quot;sim&quot; but
<br>
apparently not being let out in at least three different ways:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) he left instructions not to be let out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) the instant he got out, he asked to be returned with no in-game time
<br>
elapsed and all memories erased again
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) someone else is now playing the character &quot;Eliezer&quot;
<br>
<p>I must admit that I don't see any way in which it can be proved to me that
<br>
I'm not living in a sim.  All the research on vision which has recently been
<br>
referenced here clearly shows that we don't even really see what we think we
<br>
see.  I think that Boostrom's requirements for a simulation are way, WAY
<br>
higher than they need to be because we don't experience/know anywhere near
<br>
what we believe we experience/know (particularly if I/you are in a
<br>
individual/solipsistic sim where everyone else is either programmed or knows
<br>
about the sim and is manipulating it).  And I know that there are all sorts
<br>
of reasons why I would be willing to be placed in the last scenario since I
<br>
could easily imagine it as the method by which an advanced civilization
<br>
investigates other possibilities or even might teach their children.
<br>
<p>But, the final point which I wish to stress, however, is that while arguing
<br>
about whether or not we are in a sim is amusing . . . . ultimately, if the
<br>
sim is to be of any value, we must behave as if we are not in a sim.
<br>
Suffering (or, at least, senseless suffering and senseless deaths) cannot be
<br>
rationalized from OUR perspective and we need to strive against it with all
<br>
our might.  But, there might be a perspective from which suffering isn't
<br>
what we perceive it to be or from which it may not be senseless (or at a
<br>
minimum, self-imposed), so we certainly can't rule out the existence of a
<br>
Friendly AI with that perspective.
