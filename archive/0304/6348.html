<em>&gt; I'm not 100% sure on this myself, but I think it has do to with the fact

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were &quot;moving&quot; away from another object because of universal expansion,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You wouldn't be in motion at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I could be wrong, but I think this is a good analogy: imagine you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a flat sheet of infinitely flexible material.  Well, not on the sheet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but embedded within the sheet, with no way of escaping.  You are at one end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the sheet, and want to travel to the other end.  If the sheet is deformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the 3rd dimension, stretching it out, the distance between them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases with no velocity change in the objects relative or absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; velocity.
</em><br>
<p>Still an explanation based on Newtonian physics. A similar experiment 
<br>
was carried out by Michelson and Morley and it didn't work. G.F. 
<br>
FitzGerald saved the day with his theory of the change of longitude of 
<br>
objects as the moved near light speed. But it all applies to the Laws of 
<br>
Nature as set now. This experiment of moving with the matter in motion 
<br>
-so your relative motion is zero- does not apply to Einstein's Special 
<br>
Theory of Relativity &quot;today&quot; since the c is absolute. Well, until those 
<br>
experiments a couple of years ago where the speed of light was surpassed 
<br>
by 300 times, but not by matter, rather by photons.
<br>
<p>Another way to explain this all is that the universe was made up of 
<br>
subatomic matter moving at the speed of thought ... It wouldn't defy the 
<br>
models of today, and it would make as much sense. :-)
