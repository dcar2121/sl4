<em>&gt; &gt; PEM: No, I know that part already. What I don't understand is why it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a violation of special or general relativity for that to happen -- so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; far as I knew your relative speed to another object in space could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never exceed c. (Or perhaps it is okay because of physics I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know. I was sort of reaching for more detail on this.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Laws of Nature are all habits. When the universe was &quot;created&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those habits didn't exist yet, they were being created as well and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, after time, they became Laws. This, in any case, is how most
</em><br>
<p>I was hoping that rather than references to Rupert Sheldrake, who's
<br>
not known for being particularly in connection with reality, that we
<br>
might get some sort of explanation in terms of, say, nice falsifiable
<br>
equations.
<br>
<p><p>.pm
<br>
<p><em>&gt; laws are made (except in these days of upside down logic where laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are made by lawyers who are paid to make laws because that's another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to make money).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Theory of Morphic Resonance or Morphogenetic Fields seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain this, though since it really goes against most of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being believed today, Sheldrake's theory is still looked upon as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;scientific heresy&quot; (read: non-accepted paradigm), especially since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rupert Sheldrake has since then gone on to write about angels and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuition as scientifically acceptable ... (?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not taking this into account, if you realize that we view the Laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature as something that always existed, we are automatically implying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the universe was there as the background for those laws. But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was only just being formed, those laws could not have existed yet:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were also being created. It is not theory that makes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, but the other way round, and if our theories don't fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, then there must be something wrong with reality ... ups, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our &quot;perception&quot; of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reality is what is being reported to the system, and it is also only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as good as the sensory organs can perceive it (or the mind to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand what is being perceived).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best,
</em><br>
