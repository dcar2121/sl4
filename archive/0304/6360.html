Well, I don't so much think that the Borg, say, are &quot;real&quot;
<br>
as perhaps using them as a commonly known example of
<br>
just what kind of dangers human-machine interface could produce.
<br>
Actually, I think more subtle dangers are more likely, simply
<br>
because the obvious ones have already been depicted by such
<br>
fictions as the Borg and will almost surely be guarded against.
<br>
But I suppose that some people use the Borg to say &quot;this proves 
<br>
man-machines must be evil&quot;.
<br>
As for myself, If I were in the position of the hero in the story,
<br>
I would probably think that someone had come up with a clever
<br>
NPC program that &quot;looked&quot; like a real person, pretty much as Darin
<br>
did. Then I could see him going along with that idea,
<br>
sorta under inertia till evidence convinced him otherwise
<br>
like when Rilanya finally &quot;gave herself away&quot; as Janey.
<br>
I would probably be irked as heck at having a joke played on me.
<br>
So he acted very realistically...it's just kinda human nature to
<br>
stick with your first assumption, and to be miffed if it is proven to
<br>
be wrong. Good story, thanks for the warning about that tunnel vision.
<br>
I probably won't remember when it's important, but I might.
