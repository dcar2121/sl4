<p><em>&gt; As a Peircean pragmatist, my question is: What

</em><br>
<p>This is what i mean about keeping a distinction
<br>
between the terms 'Reality' and 'Existance'. Reality
<br>
is the stuff which can affect you like stones which
<br>
you can kick or hypothetical universes which can
<br>
interfere and affect the results of your photonic
<br>
experiment for example. 
<br>
But there are other universes, many others which can
<br>
be regarded as isolated from our own because they have
<br>
no way of affecting us physically, perhaps the best we
<br>
can do is to try to compute them or visualise them. At
<br>
some point one tends to accept the existance of
<br>
universes totally beyond our comprehensibility : both
<br>
uncomputable and unvisualisable. We cannot deny the
<br>
existance of them just because we cannot measure them
<br>
directly any more than we can deny the existance of
<br>
the number '3'.
<br>
Incidently the number 3 is an absolute form in the
<br>
same way that a computer program can be regarded as an
<br>
absolute form. Plato regonised the existance of the
<br>
numbers many thousands of years ago, he allowed them a
<br>
seperate independent existance of their own. We dont
<br>
need to actually measure the number 3 itself, it is
<br>
just an abstraction as a thing-in-itself, but
<br>
nevertheless no-one can deny the existance of the
<br>
number 3 because we use it all of the time. In the
<br>
same way: what about cantors transfinite numbers? do
<br>
they exist? we dont use them very often, except in
<br>
abstract mathematical proofs. The fact that they can
<br>
be used/thought of and that they are known to make
<br>
logical sense convinces me that they exist.
<br>
<p>So in my terminology (and because it is so
<br>
self-consistent i expect others to follow me) anything
<br>
which makes logical sense does exist. That then
<br>
includes the set of all imaginable universes since
<br>
imagination is based on algorithmic processes
<br>
manufactured in the brain.
<br>
Can a world which you have just imagined, like an
<br>
abstract fantasy world be measured? No. So by
<br>
following Ben's pragmatic philosophy it isnt real -
<br>
and i am quite happy with that --  so long as you dont
<br>
mention the word existance, because im quite convinced
<br>
that each imaginable unreal world does in fact have
<br>
its own seperate existance, its existance is just as
<br>
objective and absolute as a pure mathematical
<br>
structure like our universe or the number 3.
<br>
<p>keep it real.
<br>
Simon.
