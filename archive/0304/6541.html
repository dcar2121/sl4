</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ability to stop them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is likely (given the way the world is structured) going to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they have the desire or not.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree.  By using enough force, by exponentially analyzing
<br>
every aspect of a completely subordinate computation, total submission
<br>
can be achieved, even if it means simply stopping the subordinate
<br>
computation, or deferring it arbitrarily long.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is trivial to determine that your neighbor has not killed his
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is rather difficult to prove he hasn't performed a particular
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even if you could produce some sort of reasonable rigorous definition
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thanks for that.  I had often supposed that determining just what
<br>
your client is doing might be intractable, and your Rice's Theorem
<br>
<a href="http://kilby.stanford.edu/~rvg/154/handouts/Rice.html">http://kilby.stanford.edu/~rvg/154/handouts/Rice.html</a>
<br>
seems to confirm that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As a practical matter, even doing a very bad job might require devoting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; considerable fraction of the mass of the universe to watching what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of the mass was being used for at all times. Not a particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely scenario, IMHO.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, but it would still be easy to be proactive about it,
<br>
supposing one were ruthless enough.
<br>
<p>Rafal comments
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Since the suffering of simulations would in most cases happen only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if caused by actions of sentients willing to cause it (=malicious), or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unwilling to take simple precautions (=neglectful), supervision of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volitional aspects of sentient computations should be sufficient to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent most of it. All you need is to look into the equivalent of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fronto-orbital cortex of the sentient, check if this part of the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains the requisite rules (e.g. Rawlsian reciprocity), is stably in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of the whole personality, and voila, all the computational substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the personality's control is safe for simulated sentients, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is space for multitudes of Lee Corbins in simulated dungeons.
</em><br>
<p>Your conditions seem to amount to
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) determine what is the sentient's equivalent of the fronto-orbital
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cortext
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) determine the set of (hopefully simple) rules or general laws
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlling it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) verify that all computation under this entity's control is also
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the control of these predispositions
<br>
<p>I might suppose that any one of these three might be intractable, or worse.
<br>
(Intuitively, we seem to be running up against the problem of &quot;central
<br>
control&quot;, the most awful unconscious premise of 20th century thinking.)
<br>
<p>Moreover, the Extropian principle of continual self-transformation, if
<br>
allowed in the dominated subjects, would require continual re-evaluation.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Eliezer will succeed in the much more modest project of enabling
<br>
(or evolving) the FAI to keep *itself* from going off the rails, but as
<br>
for keeping everyone else from doing X---to the degree that it makes sense
<br>
to suppose computation exists outside the SI itself---that's much harder.
