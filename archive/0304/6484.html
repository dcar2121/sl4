<p>
I've been notified that Mike Deering of the &quot;Singularity Action Group&quot; has 
<br>
been trying to recruit new posters to SL4.  SAG was formed by Mike Deering 
<br>
and Alan Grimes as an attempted &quot;spoiler&quot; against SIAI, after they were 
<br>
kicked off SL4 for failing to meet posting standards.  As far as I can 
<br>
tell, the entire thing is based solely on personal animosity toward me. 
<br>
SAG appears to be a completely crackpot endeavor with no resources, good 
<br>
ideas, or intelligent people.
<br>
<p>Since a number of people have apparently had the bright idea of joining 
<br>
SAG to &quot;spy&quot; on it, I would like to repeat my advice of not feeding their 
<br>
need for attention.  As I wrote in my last message to the ill-fated 
<br>
SingularityAction mailing list:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An interesting anecdote:  During Israel's early days, there existed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain terrorist organization.  Mossad infiltrated this organization so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoroughly that they later found that one in ten members was a Mossad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent.  Moreover, they later found that the only reason the organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had been staying afloat was that the Mossad agents were the only ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually paying their dues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd thus like to advise everyone not to join organizations unless they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really, truly believe that the organization will be effective and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something they wish to be part of.  Otherwise, everyone joins a bad effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;to keep an eye on it&quot; and keeps it alive where the effort would otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have died a quiet death.
</em><br>
<p>Aside from this warning to anyone who may not be aware of SAG's status or 
<br>
history, I don't believe that anything needs to be done about SAG.  We 
<br>
have other things to worry about.  Please pay SAG no mind, and go about 
<br>
your business.  They are neither good enough to help nor evil enough to 
<br>
oppose.
<br>
