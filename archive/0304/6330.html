<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; No.  I am reasonably certain that fictionally imagined characters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; don't have qualia.  I'm in really, really deep trouble if they do.
</em><br>
<p>There is no chance they have &quot;qualia&quot;.  The imagined characters
<br>
are only depicted, only described, only portrayed.  It requires
<br>
specific code to go beyond that and emulate a being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So, as AI empowered characters in such games advance, perhaps to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the point of having real qualia, it eventually becomes morally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong.  Where is this point?  How can it be determined?
</em><br>
<p>If this were a gradual process, i.e., providing characters
<br>
in games with experiences (or, if you don't follow Dennett
<br>
giving them &quot;qualia&quot;), then it would always be a matter of
<br>
degree.  How many fleas *must* your dog have before you do
<br>
something about it?  How can that point be determined?
<br>
<p>Come now!  We know how to deal with continua; the problem
<br>
only comes up about 10^6 times a year.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If we exist within a sim/VR for the amusement of more powerful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beings then that at least is immoral even though we might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strictly their creations.
</em><br>
<p>All one ever NEEDS do for characters is provide *portrayals*.
<br>
Nothing more; nothing more is *ever* needed unless for some
<br>
reason you wish to equip your simulation with *emulations*.
<br>
<p>If (for some benevolent reason, shall we say) you decide to
<br>
equip your characters with feelings and thoughts, so that in
<br>
effect they are emulating some real or imagined person, then
<br>
you must give them thoughts and feelings they'll enjoy.  But
<br>
for a game or story, portrayal is all that is required.
<br>
Why emulate?
<br>
<p>Joaquim adds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we are [simulated and emulated], then they [the VR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controllers] have apparently decided that it isn't immoral.
</em><br>
<p>Any bit of egregious pain is immoral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe from their perspective, we are predictable automatons, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparable to their insects. In their opinion, we probably lack some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property that is the essence of experiencing pain and suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A higher order of qualia, maybe? &quot;Qualia^2&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, one might at first suppose that beings sufficiently advanced
<br>
from us wouldn't care, so comparatively trivial are our emotions
<br>
to theirs.  But this isn't right.  When we get to the point, and
<br>
it will be soon, that we can simulate ants, then we'll quickly
<br>
reach the point beyond that where we must choose either to continue
<br>
to merely portray them, or instead to emulate them.
<br>
<p>If we emulate them and furnish them with even a modicum of unpleasant
<br>
experience, then we are guilty of a moral crime.  Anyone here should
<br>
be able to see that it is unacceptable to emulate creatures who are
<br>
having pain, or even unpleasant experiences.  Depicting or portraying
<br>
characters never crosses that line unless we specifically build it in.
