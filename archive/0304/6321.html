<br>
<p>Interesting.  Well, I think that we definitely have a clear point of
<br>
disagreement.  I would claim that if the full (non-blocked memory) selves of
<br>
the other players consented (with all appropriate and applicable informed
<br>
consent clauses - - and particularly if there were possible benefits) then
<br>
it would not be morally wrong.  I'm interpreting your statement to mean that
<br>
you disagree.  How would you answer a criticism from me as one of the other
<br>
players that you have effectively morally outlawed the game/sim and all of
<br>
it's potential benefits because you think that I shouldn't be allowed to
<br>
give permission allowing potential harmful (but limited) effects to myself?
<br>
My position is that such a &quot;moral&quot; outlawing is itself an immoral
<br>
restriction of my potential.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But an even more disturbing idea is this; what about the AIs living
</em><br>
within the game? When they &quot;die,&quot; they're not pulled out, because they have
<br>
nowhere to go, so perhaps they regenerate (reborn, perhaps) somewhere else.
<br>
<p>Nowhere to go?  Of course they're pulled out (to the &quot;place&quot; they were
<br>
before the game/sim when they gave consent - - just like the human players).
<br>
Why would you even consider such a nasty thing as not pulling them out?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If this is a game though, it's certainly a very cruel one.
</em><br>
<p>Or one where we can't make it better without ruining the potential of the
<br>
game/sim so our non-blocked selves have decided to bite the bullet and go
<br>
with it.  And everyone else except you and I (including the Mongol invasion
<br>
and World War II) may just be background modelling (and you shouldn't be too
<br>
sure of me either . . . .  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If this really were a game, I doubt I'd come back and play it again after
</em><br>
I die and am &quot;pulled out&quot; of the game
<br>
<p>I dunno.  If I had a loved one whose existence depended upon this game/sim
<br>
(and particularly if the game/sim entailed no permanent harm to me - -
<br>
whereas their absence certainly would), I'd be willing to go through an
<br>
awful lot more abuse than I currently experience in this game/sim
<br>
(particularly as a coddled inhabitant of one of the richest areas in the
<br>
world with only an average amount of personal tragedy for that area).
