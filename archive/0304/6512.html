<p>Not at all!  If your computation produces A, then a computation that 
<br>
produces B may be so distant as to be essentially impossible.  Think of 
<br>
saying &quot;two plus two equals four&quot;.  There may be versions of you that say 
<br>
&quot;three&quot;, but they're as unlikely as versions of you that teleport through 
<br>
the nearest wall - or scarcely less so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The state of the multiverse is independent of which choice I made
</em><br>
<p>It is correlated with the result that your computation produces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; becuase in the context of U, the concept is meaningless. Only when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one is not working with the entirety of U does it become meaningful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ie, U containes the &quot;I&quot; that made choice A, but it _also_ contains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;I&quot; that made choice B. However, From the perspective of the &quot;I&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that made choice A, the other branch has been &quot;cut off&quot;, so from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I(A)'s perspective, the universe has changed in the way corresponding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to action A. However, from I(B)'s perspective, the branch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponding to A has been pruned off. Thus, from I(B)'s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective, the universe has been changed in the way coresponding to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action B.
</em><br>
<p>But B has immensely tinier measure because of your choice.  B might as 
<br>
well be assembled from quantum fluctuations.  B exists, perhaps, but you 
<br>
and any other sentient have only an infinitesimal probability of meeting him.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was not in any way arguing against that. What I was simply saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that no matter what choice I make, another &quot;I&quot; will make the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice, and the future corrsponding to that will also be.
</em><br>
<p>But with infinitesimal measure.  If, depending on your choice, one person 
<br>
died or a million people died, you'd choose so that only one person died, 
<br>
right?  You wouldn't say:  &quot;Well, the death event exists either way.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, I think of free will as the experiancing of specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branches. The me that choses A is the me that is the branch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponding to be choosing A, and similar for B.
</em><br>
<p>One of the branches has almost no measure because it is the result of 
<br>
atoms in your brain leaping around in an improbable and unphysical way.
