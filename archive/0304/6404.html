I'll use X rather than &quot;Corbin&quot; here, not knowing Corbin.

<em>&gt; &gt; I may be misunderstanding Lee's position, but the position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attributed to him sounds perfectly reasonable to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The place where it becomes an issue is in the context of AIs/uploaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans/other electronic consious beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to Corbin's position, (as I understand it) if you were an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ai created by him, then he has the right to do whatever he wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you. (ie, say.... construct a hell world or something and force you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to exist in it while he laughs maniacly... maniacal laugh not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included.)
</em><br>
<p>What does the term &quot;right&quot; mean? I'm unaware of the universe having a
<br>
list of &quot;right and wrong&quot; written in mile high diamondoid letters on
<br>
the lunar surface for us to read. Therefore at best we can discuss
<br>
what people can do and what they might want to do and why.
<br>
<p>Certainly X has the ability (given enough computing power) to
<br>
simulate creatures as intelligent as we are and torture them in
<br>
arbitrary ways.
<br>
<p>As for whether X has the &quot;right&quot; to do such a thing, the question is
<br>
utterly useless. I can perform no experiment to detect the presence or
<br>
absence of the mystical moral fluid in particular activities any more
<br>
than I can perform experiments to determine if &quot;angels&quot; are watching
<br>
my activities.
<br>
<p>The mere fact that large groups of sentients passionately disagree
<br>
about what these so-called &quot;rights&quot; are and that there is no way to
<br>
determine which of them is correct should indicate that there is no
<br>
absolute &quot;right&quot; in the universe that we can judge.
<br>
<p>At best, we can argue about whether many of us would want to stop him
<br>
from doing such things, why we might have such desires, and whether we
<br>
would be able to act on such desires.
<br>
<p>I'll leave the argument about whether anyone has the desire to stop
<br>
people from performing certain computations that simulate the
<br>
torturing of sentients to others, and stick to the question of the
<br>
ability to stop them.
<br>
<p>It is likely (given the way the world is structured) going to be
<br>
rather difficult for anyone to stop such things, whether they have the
<br>
desire or not. It is trivial to determine that your neighbor has not
<br>
killed his children (observe the children playing in the yard, say),
<br>
but it is rather difficult to prove he hasn't performed a particular
<br>
computation. As I recall, Rice's Theorem would rather get in the way
<br>
even if you could produce some sort of reasonable rigorous definition
<br>
of the computations that we are said to dislike here. As a practical
<br>
matter, even doing a very bad job might require devoting a
<br>
considerable fraction of the mass of the universe to watching what the
<br>
rest of the mass was being used for at all times. Not a particularly
<br>
likely scenario, IMHO.
