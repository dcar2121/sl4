<p><em>&gt; Having thought about exactly that problem, I concluded that a book on

</em><br>
<p>So let me get this straight:
<br>
<p>1) You consider mainstream AI research to be a wasteland, full of
<br>
anti-knowledge.
<br>
<p>2) You aren't sure anybody else can understand your grand vision. (my
<br>
words, sorry)
<br>
<p>3) You consider academic credentials a waste of your time, But claim to
<br>
have a credible reseach agenda.
<br>
<p>4) You dismiss journals of an entire wing of science for some reason I'm
<br>
not entirely sure of.
<br>
<p>5) You claim to have amazing powers of rationality few men can match.
<br>
<p>I've heard of this before, and usually it has involved campus security
<br>
dragging someone off their meds away. Granted, it has usually involved
<br>
free energy and ancient egyptian technology, but some would lump FAI in
<br>
that same category. Don't get me wrong, I've read much of the stuff you've
<br>
written, its clear to me that you are most likely not off your meds. But
<br>
your attitude is stupid, and it won't win you any respect from those who
<br>
have &quot;wasted&quot; their time with their PHd's (many of whom control the
<br>
pursestrings of granting agencies and foundations. Why?  because a PHd is
<br>
a piece of paper that says &quot;The bearer of this token is not completely
<br>
useless in the related field&quot;).
<br>
<p>I'm sorry if this comes across as harsh, but your email hit a nerve.
