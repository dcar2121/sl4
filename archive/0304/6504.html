<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, the trouble with Tegmark is that it can drive people insane

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed. I expect in the future, many beings will want brain implants 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; which will block their knowledge and understanding of Tegmarks level IV
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  multiverse - perhaps just for some temporary comfort and peace of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, or perhaps it will be necessary in very advanced beings in order 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they can remain sane while maintaining their useful mainstay 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions such as compassion and empathy.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that compassion and empathy are inherently irrational.  They 
<br>
may have irrational human implementations, but that doesn't mean that 
<br>
anything essential or valuable about them would be lost if they had 
<br>
rational humane implementations.  What does it mean to have a rational 
<br>
implementation of an emotion?  To a first approximation, it means that the 
<br>
emotion does not require believing in false statements.
<br>
<p>So why would compassion and empathy require me to disbelieve in Tegmark's 
<br>
IV, assuming it to be true?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What matters is not whether something &quot;exists&quot; or &quot;does not exist&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but its subjective conditional probability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, to YOU, the subject, those probabilities matter. But the point is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that those horrible things DO and MUST happen, and however small the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantity of those subjective scenarios relative to the other scenarios,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that fact doesnt help those poor beings that have to endure the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unimaginable tortures and suffering that necessarily occur as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory predicts.
</em><br>
<p>And pretending they don't exist is a better way to help them?  Pretending 
<br>
they don't exist means you have no way of helping them at all. 
<br>
Rationality is rationality, truth is truth, even in the face of hell.  If 
<br>
there's a real but small measure of irreducible hell, then that is the 
<br>
truth and always was.  There is nothing empathic or compassionate about 
<br>
disbelieving it; that doesn't help anyone.
<br>
<p>Or perhaps I wasn't clear on what I meant by &quot;subjective conditional 
<br>
probability&quot;; I was speaking of the subjective conditional probability of 
<br>
hell in the lives of all sentients, in every thread in the entire web of 
<br>
qualia throughout Level IV, not just my own life.  There may be an 
<br>
irreducible minimum of inescapable hells, but if so, compassion is 
<br>
reducing every reducible probability of hell that correlates with one of 
<br>
your decisions.  Which you can only do if you model the dependency.  Which 
<br>
you can only do if you model hell.  Accurately.
