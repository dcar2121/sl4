<p>Quantum indeterminancy does not apply to mathematics
<br>
Paul. You are looking at everything from the (in my
<br>
view limited) perspective that the Quantum-Mechanics
<br>
multiverse is all that exists. If you are a &quot;piercean
<br>
pragmatist&quot; they you could say that this is your
<br>
internal reality since the QM multiverse seems to
<br>
contain the extensive and only set of entities which
<br>
can interfere with your subjective reality in a
<br>
physically measurable way. You could then go on to
<br>
define your external reality as that which you cannot
<br>
measure or which cannot affect you physically. From
<br>
this definition there are things in this very universe
<br>
which supposedly exist in your external reality such
<br>
that which exists outside of your own lightcone.
<br>
Denying that the otherworldly/imaginary universes
<br>
exist is like saying that any of the universe beyond
<br>
your own lightcone does not exist, confining existance
<br>
to only that which can affect you in a real way.
<br>
<p>In terms of &quot;objective reality&quot; , in my terminology
<br>
this is an oxymoron: reality is subjective, existance
<br>
is objective - and by &quot;reality&quot; i am referring to your
<br>
subjective reality. But yes, the number 3 is
<br>
objective, all computer software is objective, our
<br>
universe is objective, unreal fantasy worlds are
<br>
objective; they are all objective in the existential
<br>
sense. Every logically consistent system has necessary
<br>
existance, and this entire ensemble can be viewed
<br>
objectively because none of it can disappear or be
<br>
altered by subjectivity, it remains perfect, immutable
<br>
and absolute. Logic does indeed have this special
<br>
property of being absolute and it is quite independent
<br>
of the affairs of the QM universes, which are a
<br>
special case of the metaverse with their own special
<br>
laws of quantum physics. 
<br>
<p>You have to remember that there ARE clockwork
<br>
deterministic universes out there (for example :
<br>
conway's game of life) even if we are not in one. Some
<br>
would also argue that the QM multiverse itself evolves
<br>
as a whole in a deterministic manner, though i dont
<br>
believe anyone is yet in a position to verify this one
<br>
way or the other, either experimentally or through
<br>
analytical reasoning.
<br>
<p>The less confining you do, the broader your
<br>
perspective is. Accepting that everything exists in
<br>
the broadest possible sense gives more plausibility to
<br>
the anthropic principle which is currently the only
<br>
theory which seems to answer the question of: Why?
<br>
<p>Simon.
