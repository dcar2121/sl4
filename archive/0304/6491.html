<p><em>&gt; &gt; According to Corbin's position, (as I understand it) if you were an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ai created by him, then he has the right to do whatever he wants to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you. (ie, say.... construct a hell world or something and force you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to exist in it while he laughs maniacally... maniacal laugh not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; included.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does the term &quot;right&quot; mean?
</em><br>
<p>So far as I have been able to tell, it's a sly way of alluding
<br>
to legal or Natural law, without coming directly out and saying
<br>
so.  One thereby invokes a goodly number of semantic links to
<br>
tradition, virtue, authority, both secular and divine, and so
<br>
it tends to carry great rhetorical weight.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm unaware of the universe having a list of &quot;right and wrong&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written in mile high diamondoid letters on the lunar surface
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for us to read. Therefore at best we can discuss what people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do and what they might want to do and why.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, thanks for stating this very clearly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly X has the ability (given enough computing power) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulate creatures as intelligent as we are and torture them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for whether X has the &quot;right&quot; to do such a thing, the question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly useless. I can perform no experiment to detect the presence or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence of the mystical moral fluid in particular activities any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I can perform experiments to determine if &quot;angels&quot; are watching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my activities.
</em><br>
<p>The question &quot;whether X has the right to do something&quot;, IMO, is more
<br>
than merely useless.  It's almost always misleading, and also is,
<br>
like I said, a bit of a cheat.
<br>
<p>The remainder of your remarks, too, are very well taken.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The mere fact that large groups of sentients passionately disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what these so-called &quot;rights&quot; are and that there is no way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine which of them is correct should indicate that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute &quot;right&quot; in the universe that we can judge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At best, we can argue about whether many of us would want to stop him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from doing such things, why we might have such desires, and whether we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be able to act on such desires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll leave the argument about whether anyone has the desire to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people from performing certain computations that simulate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torturing of sentients to others, and stick to the question of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to stop them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is likely (given the way the world is structured) going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather difficult for anyone to stop such things, whether they have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire or not. It is trivial to determine that your neighbor has not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killed his children (observe the children playing in the yard, say),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is rather difficult to prove he hasn't performed a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation. As I recall, Rice's Theorem would rather get in the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even if you could produce some sort of reasonable rigorous definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the computations that we are said to dislike here. As a practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, even doing a very bad job might require devoting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerable fraction of the mass of the universe to watching what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of the mass was being used for at all times. Not a particularly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely scenario, IMHO.
