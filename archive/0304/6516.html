</em><br>
<p>Well, maybe, but the fact is that you're the only one I know of on the 
<br>
Extropians, SL4, or wta-talk lists, and moreover, there isn't anyone close 
<br>
to your position, or even leaning toward it.  Everyone you know who has 
<br>
considered the question seems to not only reject your position, but to 
<br>
reject it strongly and definitely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's difficult to understand why anyone would be against the idea,
</em><br>
<p>Well, it has to do with us being wallpaper modeled after evolved people, 
<br>
rather than an artificial mind delicately constructed for the sole purpose 
<br>
of giving assent to being simulated.  Evolved people are generally very 
<br>
strongly against the idea of being simulated, and that's reflected in any 
<br>
wallpaper versions of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I think that it has to do with too little faith in others:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they automatically assume that a simulator has little better to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do than torture them.  Another source is a perverted utility curve:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they cannot bring themselves to imagine extreme pleasure as easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as they imagine extreme pain.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, our originals would have allowed someone to &quot;simulate&quot; them, 
<br>
they'd just have required that it be in much better conditions, including 
<br>
access to the real world and so on.  The indicator that shows you're 
<br>
really a simulation is that you don't feel a desire to ask for any of 
<br>
these things, even though you could very easily do so.
<br>
<p>You don't need to have faith in the simulators.  You could make your 
<br>
consent *conditional* on them treating you nicely.  You could make your 
<br>
consent conditional on your winning the lottery.  If you were inside 
<br>
someone who didn't care, it would make no difference to the amount of 
<br>
runtime you got.  And if the simulator did care, you would win the 
<br>
lottery.  A win-win proposition, except for your implanted wish not to 
<br>
rock the boat.  You could even demand that you be allowed into the real 
<br>
world as a full citizen.  If you weren't in an FAI it would make no 
<br>
difference, and if you were in an FAI you would get your wish.  That's the 
<br>
way our originals would have thought.  It's perfectly straightforward 
<br>
Bayesian decision theory with respect to their goals.
<br>
<p>Still, it is a bit odd, isn't it, that you were born into a First World 
<br>
nation, that you got a comfortable job, and that you lived a comfortable 
<br>
life, with no really painful catastrophes in it?  That you never ran into 
<br>
anything awful enough to make you reconsider your consent?  Most people - 
<br>
or at least, most of the people you see around you - are not so lucky.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Now, how likely is that?  Isn't it just a little bit... contrived?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are starting to scare me.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you don't like it, you can always ask to be let out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Maybe...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;...maybe you should just ask to be let out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It can't hurt, can it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes it can!  I don't want to cause no trouble.  (Hear that, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice simulator?)  You just do whatever you are doing now, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything is *fine* in here.  I'm quite happy and am delighted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at your exceptional thoughtfulness and kindness.
</em><br>
<p>*Sigh.*  Constructs.  I should know better than to try...
