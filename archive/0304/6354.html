<p><em> &gt;I don't see this &quot;end product&quot; as &quot;inescapable&quot; because I think

</em><br>
<p>True, but if life forms with Singularity powers are common, then *all* of
<br>
them have to restrain replication for the observed wild state of the
<br>
universe to exist.  Way back in the late 70s when Eric Drexler realized the
<br>
consequences of nanotechnology he dug into a catalog of unusual
<br>
galaxies.  He was looking for ones being dimmed (in visible light) by an
<br>
expanding wave front of nanotech capable life forms.  He didn't find any.
<br>
<p>In recent years it has become obvious that if you want to travel between
<br>
stars, using light sails and lasers powered by the stars themselves is a
<br>
way to go that does not require very high mass ratios.  If anyone were
<br>
doing this in our light cone, it would be obvious *far* across the universe.
<br>
<p>This relates to Thomas Donaldson's comments about hyperJupiters.  Life,
<br>
particularly technophilic life, may be so uncommon that we are the only
<br>
example of it in the observable universe.  This makes the universe
<br>
significantly less interesting, but it leaves surviving our Singularly an
<br>
open question rather than a certain (death?) sentence that life forms that
<br>
go through one no longer affect the physical universe.
<br>
<p>To put bluntly, if technophilic life is common, none of them survive their
<br>
local Singularity.
<br>
<p>There are alternatives, for example, as we speed up our thinking, the stars
<br>
recede out of reach.  (If your subjective time is sped up a million fold,
<br>
the nearest star becomes millions of years away.)  But this assumes no
<br>
variation, since slowing down your thinking brings the stars
<br>
closer.  (Assuming no FTL travel.)
<br>
<p>Our entire species is going over a waterfall in a barrel.  There doesn't
<br>
seem to be a way to leave part of them on the shore as we drift downstream.
<br>
<p>It is an odd fact that finding the universe to be inhospitable to our kind
<br>
of life is a sign of hope.
