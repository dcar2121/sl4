Ok, point by point, I'm going to show how the negative
<br>
feelings you mentioned can be integrated and
<br>
experienced as positive bliss.

<br>
<em>&gt; In fact, this is a bad thing.  The people with that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; syndrome generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die in their early 20s.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that not feeling pain or any other emotion for
<br>
that matter is a bad thing.  My thesis though, is that
<br>
as long as you feel the feeling you are able to
<br>
receive all the information that feeling has for you,
<br>
but more importantly it is possible and desirable to
<br>
do so PLEASURABLY.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The reason is that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have the feedback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals that tell them when they're damaging their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body, and they suffer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from massive inflammation of the joints simply from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not shifting their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight when it gets uncomfortable, something that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second nature to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of us that feel pain. 
</em><br>
<p>Pain ultimately is intense amounts of energy that
<br>
emanate from the damaged area to your brain.  Most
<br>
people experience this intensity in a negative
<br>
context, resulting in suffering.  It is possible, and
<br>
I can attest, to experience this energy as
<br>
pleasurable.  Last year I fell off an elevated
<br>
platform, and broke my ankle, and experience some
<br>
seriois abrasions in several areas.  I immediately
<br>
applied everyting I learned in Yoga and Vivation, and
<br>
within 30 seconds began to feel the intense pain, as
<br>
intense pleasure, and because of that was even more
<br>
accutely aware of the damaged areas, and took great
<br>
care to not damage myself further.  According to the
<br>
doctors, I healed almost twice as fast as normal.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That is going to be true of many of the negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we feel.  The ability to feel sad is the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side of the coin of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ability to feel love and commitment.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't feel sad when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you child died, could you have really loved your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, feeling sadness is again important.  But when
<br>
sadness is truly integrated, the tears flow, and the
<br>
overwhelming feeling is tranformed into one of deep
<br>
gratitude.  I lost my father to pancreatic cancer, at
<br>
the first of this year.  As I integrated more and more
<br>
of the grief, my sense of gratitude deepened, and I
<br>
was able to be truly be present and loving to my
<br>
father in his last days.  While I was by his bedside
<br>
loving and laughing with my father, most of my family
<br>
were off in their rooms in depression and grief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel anxious, I'm sure I don't have to remind anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this room that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anxiety gets us to do many things that otherwise we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not have done.
</em><br>
<p>There are only two types of fear - rational and
<br>
irrational.  Rational fear is what you feel if you are
<br>
about to get hit by a truck, and you run to move out
<br>
of its way. Most anxiety however, is irrational fear.
<br>
A good example of irrational fear (anxiety) is stage
<br>
fright.  When you integrate irrational fears they
<br>
transform into feelings of excitement.  Many stage
<br>
performers and public speakers have learned to
<br>
transform their stage fright into excitement, which
<br>
makes them the best in their fields.  Those who can't
<br>
integrate these anxieties fail to achieve greatness on
<br>
the stage.  Same goes for any other anxiety - its
<br>
crippling unless integrated into excitement.  Keep in
<br>
mind, the feeling itself is not changing, the context
<br>
in which you choose to experience it does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; a function, as long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we realize that reducing these negative emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to zero, as with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reducing pain to zero, would not be a good thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you are right.  But instead of reducing negative
<br>
emotions to zero, the energy of the emotion is
<br>
conserved, and is experienced as pleasurable ecstacy.
