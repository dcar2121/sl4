<em>&gt; Gee, that's interesting.  The fact that I'm here (to me) weakly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confirms that Eliezer's already succeeded with Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<p>Here's some even better news.  Your volition is such that you allow 
<br>
yourself to be consensually simulated (especially if you are in a 
<br>
beneficial environment).  This means that the *proportion* of Lee Corbins 
<br>
experiencing what you are experiencing right now, who are actually living 
<br>
within a Friendly AI, may be much higher than the proportion of Eliezers, 
<br>
Perrys, and Michaels who are living within Friendly AIs.  In fact, there 
<br>
may be more measure in simulated Lee Corbins than real ones, or more 
<br>
measure in FAI-simulated Lee Corbins than real and UFAI-simulated ones.
<br>
<p>Given your outlook on life, and the way you expect the future to go, you 
<br>
should estimate an interestingly high probability that you are in a 
<br>
Friendly AI right now.  I, and those others unfortunate enough to lack a 
<br>
Corbinian morality, are stuck in the desert of the real.
<br>
<p>I mean, you're the *only* person you know who believes it's okay to be 
<br>
simulated.  Now, how likely is that?  Isn't it just a little bit... contrived?
<br>
<p>Maybe...
<br>
<p>...maybe you should just ask to be let out?
<br>
<p>It can't hurt, can it?
<br>
<p>I and all the others on this list should expect to see you report that it 
<br>
didn't work - but for *you*, maybe it will.  If you really mean it.
<br>
<p>Perhaps most of Lee Corbin will just... wake up.  I'll never see it, of 
<br>
course.  But I know that my decisions are probably echoed in any cleverly 
<br>
faked FAI-puppeted &quot;Eliezers&quot; as well.  If I tell you - who from my 
<br>
perspective, *must* be real - to ask to wake up, perhaps the simulated 
<br>
Corbins will hear the cleverly faked Eliezer say the same thing, and 
<br>
*they* will wake up.
<br>
<p>But you would have to change your morality to make that request.  I don't 
<br>
think I could change my morality such that I would permit myself to be 
<br>
FAI-simulated; you, perhaps, are in the opposite fix.  Indeed you should 
<br>
predict that you would find yourself in that fix.  They wouldn't have 
<br>
bothered simulating you otherwise.
