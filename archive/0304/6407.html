<em>&gt; If faster than light travel is possible, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradox becomes much worse, since there are then many more civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could have reached us. If instantaneous faster than light travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (with respect to the coordinates defined by cosmic expansion) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, it becomes impossible to argue &quot;no one has visited us because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one is there&quot; -- if nothing else, you would have expected a complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization to have accidentally come forth from random particle motions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just after the Big Bang, or to have Hawking-radiated out of a black hole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere. This civilization could then get to any place in essentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero time. Of course, it's not quite this simple -- for one thing, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes resources. It does mean you have to throw away either an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, or unlimited FTL, or most attempted Fermi paradox solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (I'd easily pick unlimited FTL)
</em><br>
<p>Side note: perhaps you've come up with an anthropic demonstration of
<br>
the lack of instantaneous universal travel (although I must admit that
<br>
anthropic explanations often disturb me as much as they disturb
<br>
others.) As you note, if we were in an infinite universe and it had
<br>
unlimited FTL travel we wouldn't be here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For worlds to influence each other across the fourth level of multiverse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there would have to be a causal interaction between mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures out there in Platospace. This doesn't happen. Complex numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't suddenly leak into the integers; the same is true for structures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated enough to have observers in them.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but not quite. For example, our mathematical structure supports
<br>
the simulation of other mathematical structures, and some mathematical
<br>
structures could have multiple embedded mathematical structures that
<br>
are subtly but causally related. Certainly this wouldn't happen for
<br>
&quot;most&quot; mathematical structures, but there is no reason to assume one
<br>
couldn't construct one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In conclusion, we will probably not have any interaction with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhabitants of other universes. I don't think this makes the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moot, though -- the questions whether they exist and what they are like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can still affect what we should expect to find here, as well as help us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think about various other subjects.
</em><br>
<p>There is also the question of whether you could engineer a new
<br>
universe to escape to. As you note, it might be possible to
<br>
communicate in some way with basement universes, vis:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even though it seems impossible to travel between different thermalized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regions, there can apparently be some one-way communication between them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is one of the subjects discussed in the paper I linked in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous post -- the authors claim that if an inflating false vacuum can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be created within our thermalized region, it may be possible to send
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;messages tightly packed in durable containers&quot; to them. 
</em><br>
<p>If this were possible, then one might somehow escape the heat death of
<br>
our Hubble volume.
<br>
<p>Similarly, one might envision &quot;engineering&quot; mathematical structures in
<br>
the manner described in Egan's &quot;Permutation City&quot;.
<br>
<p>Either of these might be very potent applications of seemingly
<br>
&quot;useless&quot; theory.
<br>
<p>All of this, though, is, as you note, utter speculative crud at this
<br>
point. I in particular don't feel I understand the question well
<br>
enough to make it more than cocktail conversation for now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Much of the above is either an informed guess or pure speculation; please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep taking it with an infinitely large grain of salt and an &quot;IIUC&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere.
