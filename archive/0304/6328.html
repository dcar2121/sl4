<em>&gt; Suppose that for the ultimate in realism and to truly &quot;live the game&quot;,
</em><br>
I've decided to accept the temporary blockage of all outside-game knowledge.
<br>
Until I &quot;die&quot; inside the game, I won't remember/know about anything outside
<br>
the game but once I &quot;die&quot;, I will go on living my normal life outside the
<br>
game.  Is this morally wrong (Assume that we're advanced enough that there
<br>
is no way in which in-game events can harm, much less traumatize, my
<br>
outside-game self)?
<br>
<p>Eliezer replied:
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes, because &quot;you&quot; and &quot;you with your memories elided&quot; are *two different
</em><br>
people* - your future self is a different person, for purposes of volition,
<br>
than your past self.  The past you that decided to have its memories elided
<br>
is not the you who suffers and says &quot;Let me out!&quot;
<br>
<p>AHA!  That's a pretty important distinction.  I'm going to chew on that for
<br>
a while.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But wouldn't you have decided to play Darwin or Gandhi rather than Mark
</em><br>
Waser?
<br>
<p>No, not really.  I've had a good life, I've learned a lot, and who knows,
<br>
maybe something famous is coming up in my future.  Would you have decided to
<br>
play Darwin or Gandhi instead of Eliezer (or do you expect to be famous for
<br>
your herioc efforts to bring on the singularity . . . .  :-)?  Besides,
<br>
maybe I have already played Darwin and Gandhi and many others and gotten
<br>
tired of the fame thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I could know this was a sim via a method of knowledge that definitely
</em><br>
discriminated between simulated Eliezers and planetary-evolved Eliezers, I
<br>
would behave very differently; I would start looking for a girlfriend, for
<br>
example.
<br>
<p>I'd strongly recommend that you start looking anyways.  Being focused and
<br>
single-minded is not always the best way to solve a problem.  Sometimes it
<br>
takes walking away and letting your subconscious chew on it for a while for
<br>
most effective action.  You need to keep living life and staying in touch
<br>
with what you want to evolve.  Tunnel vision is bad.  Burnout is very, very
<br>
bad.
