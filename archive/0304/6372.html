<em>&gt; the age of the universe is only 13.7 billion light years (to within 1%,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to the WMAP data). This, apparently, because of the expansion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the universe. I don't pretend to understand how the universe could

</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- perhaps someone with a physics background could explain about this.
</em><br>
<p>There seem to be two different issues here.
<br>
<p>Firstly, why has the visible universe expanded faster than light?
<br>
<p>This question can be answered without referring to strange relativistic
<br>
effects. The explanation is that far away points sent out their light a
<br>
long time ago, and in the mean time these points have been receding from
<br>
us. By assuming the universe was always &quot;matter-dominated&quot; and taking
<br>
into account how the scale factor of the universe changes over time, you
<br>
can calculate that the present radius of the region we can see (actually,
<br>
whose past we can see) is exactly 3 times the distance light could have
<br>
travelled. (Since the assumptions made are only approximately correct, so
<br>
is the factor of 3).
<br>
<p>It's a bit confusing to think about this, because what we see is not a
<br>
large region of space at one time, but a &quot;slice out of spacetime&quot; where
<br>
each point we see is at a different time. So the 42 Gly-radius visible
<br>
universe is not actually what we see through telescopes, but a
<br>
&quot;straightened out&quot; extrapolation; and different definitions for &quot;visible
<br>
universe&quot; are possible.
<br>
<p>(I'm allowed to speak of a definite &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot; in this case,
<br>
because Friedman-Robertson-Walker universes have a nice &quot;preferred&quot; set
<br>
of coordinates with respect to which the universe is homogeneous and
<br>
isotropic)
<br>
<p>Secondly, why does the distance between different points (say, beyond the
<br>
visible universe) increase faster than light?
<br>
<p>The answer has nothing to do with quantum mechanics or varying speed of
<br>
light. Also, while &quot;they're *not* moving apart, it's *space itself* that
<br>
expands&quot; is a good way to think about it intuitively, I don't think this
<br>
distinction has any absolute meaning in general relativity. All you can
<br>
say mathematically is that the difference in a certain coordinate
<br>
increases, and usually it's handy to think of this as space expanding (to
<br>
contrast with special relativity).
<br>
<p>The short and unenlightening answer to the question is that &quot;relative
<br>
velocity&quot; and &quot;frame of reference&quot; are special-relativistic concepts
<br>
only, that special relativity is general relativity applied to Minkowski
<br>
space, and that Friedman-Robertson-Walker space (our universe, or a good
<br>
approximation) is not Minkowski space.
<br>
<p>For a longer and more enlightening answer, I would have to show why
<br>
objects can't move apart faster than light in Minkowski space, what
<br>
coordinates in FRW space play the same roles as what coordinates in
<br>
Minkowski space, and why the reason you can't go faster than light
<br>
doesn't work. I don't know how to do this (especially not in a way that
<br>
makes intuitive sense), but I can make a few possibly useful remarks.
<br>
<p>I said that FRW space is not Minkowski space, but this is not completely
<br>
true. A completely empty (and therefore open) FRW universe turns out to
<br>
be Minkowski space, but in weird coordinates. These coordinates are just
<br>
as valid as those used in special relativity (they're chosen to make use
<br>
of the symmetries that come from viewing the space as an expanding
<br>
universe). Special relativity still holds, and in special relativistic
<br>
coordinates no two objects can go faster than light with respect to each
<br>
other. But the &quot;cosmic time&quot; used when viewing it as an expanding
<br>
universe is not the same as (any of) the special relativistic time
<br>
coordinate(s), and it turns out that with respect to the &quot;cosmic time&quot;
<br>
things can move apart faster than light.
<br>
<p>When there's a certain (critical) mass density, the universe becomes
<br>
flat, instead of open; now it's no longer Minkowski space in weird
<br>
coordinates, but something else entirely that looks a bit like Minkowski
<br>
space at each moment, but expands. Since space and time get mixed up in
<br>
coordinate transformations, you can no longer do everything you could do
<br>
in Minkowski space (due to the changing scale factor). For example,
<br>
measuring distances using light beams becomes messier. Apparently, this
<br>
lets distances increase faster than light without causing any
<br>
contradiction or time-loop. (Intuitively, this should be clear from the
<br>
balloon model)
<br>
<p>Ned Wright's cosmology tutorial at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_02.htm#MD">http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_02.htm#MD</a>
<br>
<p>lists several different notions of distance that can be used and makes
<br>
all this handwaving of mine mathematically precise. There's also a
<br>
cosmology FAQ on that site that I recommend looking at.
<br>
<p><p><p>Paul Hughes asks how a finite universe can become infinite in a finite
<br>
amount of time. This is a common question, and the answer is that it
<br>
can't -- infinite universes are already infinite at all times. When
<br>
people say &quot;back then, the universe was only as large as a tennis ball&quot;,
<br>
they mean the visible universe.
<br>
<p>You'd think the universe was only a point at the initial singularity and
<br>
therefore finite. But this is not necessarily true -- the initial
<br>
singularity is not a part of the &quot;spacetime manifold&quot;, so in a sense, it
<br>
never existed, and it's only meaningful to speak of times after the
<br>
initial singularity. I think for this reason you can't really say whether
<br>
it's a point or something else (what do you get when you compress an
<br>
infinite space in such a way that every finite part of it gets compressed
<br>
to one point?)
<br>
<p>It's also possible that there was no initial singularity, as in
<br>
past-eternal eternal inflation. In this case what we think of as our
<br>
universe originated in a &quot;pre-universe&quot; that had already existed forever.
<br>
One of the things I learned from Tegmark's paper is that apparently a
<br>
universe-bubble such as ours can be spatially finite in one set of
<br>
coordinates (from the &quot;outside&quot;) and spatially infinite in another set of
<br>
coordinates (from the &quot;inside&quot;).
<br>
<p>(A semi-interesting fact I just discovered: it's apparently possible in
<br>
GR for a &quot;naked singularity&quot; to become a &quot;thunderbolt singularity&quot; or a
<br>
&quot;wave of death&quot;, meaning that it starts expanding as a sphere at the
<br>
speed of light, &quot;eating&quot; everything in its path (i.e., its causal future
<br>
just stops existing). Now *that's* unFriendly.)
<br>
<p>Hope I got all this right,
<br>
<p>Nus
<br>
(yeah, first post, hi all)

&quot;Doctor, why is the TARDIS bigger on the inside than it is on the
outside?&quot;
&quot;Oh, that's because it's Dimensionally Transcendental.&quot;
&quot;What does 'Dimensionally Transcendental' mean?&quot;
&quot;It means that it's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.&quot;
