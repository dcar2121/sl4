<p>Sorry, but this is ridiculous. As someone who earned a
<br>
BS in mathematics, I can tell you that more than half
<br>
of my understadning and subsequent success came from
<br>
my intuition.  Back in the 1980's I came to the
<br>
conclusion that all formal, informal and yet to be
<br>
discovered mathematics have a basis for physical
<br>
existence.  Sure, I didn't have proof of this, but a
<br>
combination of logical deductive reasoning and
<br>
intuition led me to that conclusion.  Now 15 years
<br>
later, we have physicists like Tegmark making the same
<br>
more detailed and developed conclusions on at least
<br>
2/3 of my proposition.
<br>
<p>In the last 20 years I have yet to see a single major
<br>
advance on the nature of the universe not fit within
<br>
my intuitional insights of how I suspected the
<br>
universe works.
<br>
<p>Intution alone may not solve the problem, but in cases
<br>
like this it has always leads me in the right
<br>
direction, which in turn was invariably and logically
<br>
demonstrated by myself or others.
<br>
<p>Perhaps for you Perry your intuition is useless to
<br>
you. However, to go on and say that ALL intution is
<br>
useless for things beyond which we evolved for is a
<br>
very strong statement with little to back it up, as
<br>
there is no way for you or anyone else to account for
<br>
all of it going on in the noosphere.
<br>
<p>Paul
<br>
<p>P.S. Simon is correct about Einstien.  Almost of all
<br>
of Special Relativity was entirely derived by
<br>
Einstiens intuition, which he later demonstrated
<br>
mathematically when he got the proper training in the
<br>
necessary tensor calculus.
