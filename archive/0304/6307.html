This is taken from the Bioethics council on March 6th, 2003; session 3:
<br>
Human Nature and Its Future.  I think Dr. Steven Pinker makes a good
<br>
point.  I am not certain that we can have our yin without our yang.
<br>
<p>&quot;DR. PINKER: Morally, the question of whether we should eliminate all of
<br>
the rough spots and pain of the human condition, the depression, the
<br>
anxiety and so on, I'll give you an analogy of physical pain. 
<br>
<p>There is a syndrome studied by one of my undergraduate teachers, Ronald
<br>
Melzack, in which some people are born without the ability to feel pain,
<br>
and first you might think, &quot;Wow, what a great thing.  You know, you'd
<br>
stub your toe and you'd walk away without, you know, swearing and
<br>
feeling the agony and so on.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In fact, this is a bad thing.  The people with that syndrome generally
<br>
die in their early 20s.  The reason is that they don't have the feedback
<br>
signals that tell them when they're damaging their body, and they suffer
<br>
from massive inflammation of the joints simply from not shifting their
<br>
weight when it gets uncomfortable, something that's second nature to the
<br>
rest of us that feel pain. 
<br>
<p>That is going to be true of many of the negative psychological emotions
<br>
that we feel.  The ability to feel sad is the other side of the coin of
<br>
the ability to feel love and commitment.  If you didn't feel sad when
<br>
you child died, could you have really loved your child?  If you can't
<br>
feel anxious, I'm sure I don't have to remind anyone in this room that
<br>
anxiety gets us to do many things that otherwise we would not have done.
<br>
<p><p>On the other hand, getting back to the touchstone of pain, it's also not
<br>
the case that if you have a toothache you should stay off the aspirin
<br>
because pain is a good thing. 
<br>
<p>Pain, like negative psychological emotions is a mechanism that has a
<br>
function.  On the other hand, it's in many cases a clumsy, over-
<br>
reactive mechanism, and once we recognize what these negative emotions
<br>
ought to be doing in order for us to lead better lives, there's no
<br>
reason, I think, for people to suffer simply because on average in the
<br>
species, the mechanism is there for a purpose. 
<br>
<p>So I don't think there would be a sound argument for preventing people
<br>
who are depressed or anxious or irritable or hyperactive from doing
<br>
something that would lead to an increase in their well-being simply
<br>
because it's unnatural or because the mechanism had a function, as long
<br>
as we realize that reducing these negative emotions to zero, as with
<br>
reducing pain to zero, would not be a good thing either.&quot;

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you really believe suffering should be alleviated?  I think it is
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incredible motivator (I personally have always found that I work
</em><br>
harder when
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my back is against the wall).  It is the ultimate object lesson.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael LaTorra already said almost everything I wanted to say, and it
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; remains only to point out that while you might choose to regard
</em><br>
certain 
<br>
<em>&gt; forms of suffering as building character, you cannot make that choice
</em><br>
for 
<br>
<em>&gt; others.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, because Michael wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Low level suffering, such as anxiety and frustration, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed be motivators.  And these psychological forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering may, as you said John, be around in some form forever.
</em><br>
<p>May we hope not!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But they can be mitigated. And they are not necessary preconditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for motivating oneself or others.  There are other means.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  All our intuitions have been built up by evolution,
<br>
and from my point of view, it seems that we all too easily
<br>
fail to reach for the grandest optimum, and imagine too
<br>
eagerly constraints for which no evidence exists.  We should
<br>
assume that in every way we can have our cake and eat it too,
<br>
until it is proved somehow it's not possible.
<br>
<p>But no one, IMO, has said it as well as David Pearce:
<br>
<p>www.hedweb.com
<br>
<p>David's essay is one of the most difficult I've ever read.
<br>
Most sentences are of the form &quot;Whereas X, it follows that Y&quot;,
<br>
where each of X and Y are quite formidable extensions (and more
<br>
radical paraphrasings) of what I might have only glimpsed
<br>
earlier.
<br>
<p>But next to cryonics, &quot;The Hedonistic Imperative&quot; is the
<br>
greatest moral revolution I've experienced in my entire life.
