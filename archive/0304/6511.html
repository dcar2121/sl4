<p><em>&gt; You're *within* U.  *You yourself* are part of the play and flow of
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; probabilities.  In the moment when you decide whether to help or
</em><br>
hurt 
<br>
<em>&gt; someone, that decision is embodied in the flow of the probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amplitudes, and the future correlates with your decision.  Of
</em><br>
course the 
<br>
<em>&gt; future is determined.  It's determined by the probability
</em><br>
amplitudes. 
<br>
<em>&gt; It's determined by you.  It's determined by your decision.  All
</em><br>
these 
<br>
<em>&gt; statements are equivalent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course I'm a part of U. But...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The timeless form of the decision rule is that given choices A vs.
</em><br>
B, you 
<br>
<em>&gt; should consider the state of the multiverse given that your
</em><br>
decision is A, 
<br>
<em>&gt; versus its state given that your decision is B, then pick whichever
</em><br>
choice 
<br>
<em>&gt; corresponds to the more desirable state.  Only correlation is
</em><br>
necessary - 
<br>
<em>&gt; not &quot;time&quot; or &quot;causality&quot;.  Note that this resolves Newcomb's
</em><br>
Paradox.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Me making choice A or B simply means _being_ the branch of the
<br>
multiverse corresponding to my making that decision. There is of
<br>
course another &quot;I&quot; that makes the other choice.
<br>
<p>The state of the multiverse is independant of which choice I made
<br>
becuase in the context of U, the concept is meaningless. Only when
<br>
one is not working with the entirety of U does it become meaningful.
<br>
ie, U containes the &quot;I&quot; that made choice A, but it _also_ contains
<br>
the &quot;I&quot; that made choice B. However, From the perspective of the &quot;I&quot;
<br>
that made choice A, the other branch has been &quot;cut off&quot;, so from
<br>
I(A)'s perspective, the universe has changed in the way corresponding
<br>
to action A. However, from I(B)'s perspective, the branch
<br>
corresponding to A has been pruned off. Thus, from I(B)'s
<br>
perspective, the universe has been changed in the way coresponding to
<br>
action B.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Making &quot;meaningful choices&quot; means that the computation embodying
</em><br>
your 
<br>
<em>&gt; decision is what determines the future.  To make meaningful
</em><br>
choices, the 
<br>
<em>&gt; future must be determined by &quot;mere&quot; physics, and we ourselves must
</em><br>
be 
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mere&quot; physics, because only in this way can *we* determine the
</em><br>
future. 
<br>
<em>&gt; The future is determined; it's determined by the physical process
</em><br>
that is 
<br>
<em>&gt; your choice, now.  Knowing in the abstract that the future is
</em><br>
determined 
<br>
<em>&gt; is not the same as knowing *what* the future is determined to be;
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt; future is determined by you, yourself, making a choice under
</em><br>
uncertainty. 
<br>
<em>&gt;   If you don't yet know your choice, you can't possibly know the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterministic future, because what the future is determined by, is
</em><br>
your 
<br>
<em>&gt; choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I was not in any way arguing against that. What I was simply saying
<br>
is that no matter what choice I make, another &quot;I&quot; will make the other
<br>
choice, and the future corrsponding to that will also be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your choice at T+1 is determined by the physical process at time T
</em><br>
that is 
<br>
<em>&gt; your mind, but at time T, that physical process doesn't yet
</em><br>
internally 
<br>
<em>&gt; represent (&quot;know&quot;) what its choice will be, so it doesn't
</em><br>
internally 
<br>
<em>&gt; represent (&quot;know&quot;) the outcome at time T+2 of any processes
</em><br>
determined by 
<br>
<em>&gt; that choice.  The outcome at time T+2 is determined by the
</em><br>
computations of 
<br>
<em>&gt; a cognitive process at T which does not yet know its own decision
</em><br>
at T+1. 
<br>
<em>&gt;   That's what we call &quot;free will&quot;.  Note the noncoincidental
</em><br>
resemblance 
<br>
<em>&gt; to the halting problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think of free will as the experiancing of specific
<br>
branches. The me that choses A is the me that is the branch
<br>
corresponding to be choosing A, and similar for B.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now you can get messed up if you know the abstract fact that the
</em><br>
future is 
<br>
<em>&gt; determined by physics, and you think of &quot;physics&quot; as something
</em><br>
outside 
<br>
<em>&gt; yourself, rather than a system that includes you as a part.  You
</em><br>
may get 
<br>
<em>&gt; the idea that the future is dependent on something other than your
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; decisions, or that your decisions are determined by something other
</em><br>
than 
<br>
<em>&gt; your own cognition under uncertainty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Again, I wasn't arguing against that.
