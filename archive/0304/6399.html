&quot;Mike Williams&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mikew12345@lvcm.com?Subject=Re:%20Infinite%20universe">mikew12345@lvcm.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<em>&gt; If it were possible for our universe to interact with the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes, then it would have already happened.  Since it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible that one of the universes would have the desire and ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consume the others, that would have already happened.
</em><br>
<p>If I'm interpreting you correctly, you're stating the multiverse version
<br>
of the Fermi paradox. I don't think it applies in the way you're arguing.
<br>
<p>Using Tegmark's classification of levels, the first level of multiverse
<br>
is, in my opinion, the most likely to cause Fermi problems. If faster
<br>
than light travel is not possible, then we need only account for the
<br>
observable universe. If faster than light travel is possible, then the
<br>
paradox becomes much worse, since there are then many more civilizations
<br>
that could have reached us. If instantaneous faster than light travel
<br>
(with respect to the coordinates defined by cosmic expansion) is
<br>
possible, it becomes impossible to argue &quot;no one has visited us because
<br>
no one is there&quot; -- if nothing else, you would have expected a complete
<br>
civilization to have accidentally come forth from random particle motions
<br>
just after the Big Bang, or to have Hawking-radiated out of a black hole
<br>
somewhere. This civilization could then get to any place in essentially
<br>
zero time. Of course, it's not quite this simple -- for one thing, it
<br>
takes resources. It does mean you have to throw away either an infinite
<br>
universe, or unlimited FTL, or most attempted Fermi paradox solutions.
<br>
(I'd easily pick unlimited FTL)
<br>
<p>The second level is much more Fermi-friendly. In one sense, the false
<br>
vacuum and other thermalized regions are more than infinitely far away
<br>
-- if you kept flying, you could never get there, because in the
<br>
&quot;external&quot; time your thermalized region is expanding too quickly. This
<br>
may be what they mean by &quot;to infinity... and beyond!&quot;. In another,
<br>
probably more accurate sense, these events are in your past. This means
<br>
that you can't get there, unless you know of a way to travel back in
<br>
time through the Big Bang.
<br>
<p>Even if you could do that, I'm not sure it would be possible to exist
<br>
there. The false vacuum is in principle just ordinary space, but with
<br>
weird fields in it. IIUC, the kinds of particles we know couldn't
<br>
exist there.
<br>
<p>The dimensionality of the false vacuum is not known; it depends on what
<br>
theory of quantum gravity is correct. In the context where different
<br>
thermalized regions have different dimensions because different
<br>
compactifications occur (in string theory), I'm pretty sure it's
<br>
(10+1)-dimensional. In loop quantum gravity, it would probably be
<br>
(3+1)-dimensional. In other theories, it would be some other number
<br>
that I don't know; probably also 3+1. Also, I have no idea what
<br>
theories of quantum gravity are compatible with the chaotic eternal
<br>
inflation picture.
<br>
<p>One thing I'm sure of is that the false vacuum is physical space, not
<br>
quantum-mechanical infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Hilbert space
<br>
contains quantum states, not places. It's not the sort of space you could
<br>
fly through in a space ship. (I hope this answers Paul Hughes's question)
<br>
<p>Even though it seems impossible to travel between different thermalized
<br>
regions, there can apparently be some one-way communication between them.
<br>
This is one of the subjects discussed in the paper I linked in my
<br>
previous post -- the authors claim that if an inflating false vacuum can
<br>
be created within our thermalized region, it may be possible to send
<br>
&quot;messages tightly packed in durable containers&quot; to them. They then argue
<br>
that this is pointless, because only finitely many civilizations would
<br>
receive them, so that this wouldn't increase the probability. I don't
<br>
think I agree with this argument; I'm not sure it wouldn't also prove
<br>
it's pointless to get up in the morning.
<br>
<p>I also remember reading that there could theoretically be ways to set the
<br>
values of the fundamental constants in future thermalized regions. If
<br>
this is possible, it's likely that this is true in our case (only very
<br>
few universes would have constants compatible with the existence of life
<br>
by accident). Could this be used to send messages -- say, an AI design?
<br>
The values are constrained somewhat by the need to make the universe
<br>
suitable for life; it seems to me the decimal places beyond that could be
<br>
used. At our present knowledge, it can't yet be much information, though
<br>
-- not that many fundamental constants, and only a few decimal places per
<br>
constant. Still, it seems to me to have a greater chance of working than
<br>
SETI. Does anyone know of attempts to systematically look for messages in
<br>
the values of physical constants? (not Pi -- that's as silly as hiding a
<br>
message deep in the number 19)
<br>
<p>Returning to the multiversal Fermi paradox, could different level 3
<br>
universes (quantum worlds) communicate? If the correct quantum mechanical
<br>
theory is linear (which is true as far as we can tell experimentally),
<br>
then the answer is no -- &quot;linear&quot; means that different terms superposed
<br>
in a wave function (&quot;worlds&quot;) evolve independently. If physics is not
<br>
exactly linear, then it may or may not be possible to make use of this to
<br>
communicate with or travel to other quantum worlds. This has been used to
<br>
argue physics is exactly linear (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#exact">http://www.hedweb.com/manworld.htm#exact</a>) because if it wasn't, we'd have
<br>
noticed the inter-world travellers by now.
<br>
<p>For worlds to influence each other across the fourth level of multiverse,
<br>
there would have to be a causal interaction between mathematical
<br>
structures out there in Platospace. This doesn't happen. Complex numbers
<br>
don't suddenly leak into the integers; the same is true for structures
<br>
complicated enough to have observers in them.
<br>
<p>In conclusion, we will probably not have any interaction with the
<br>
inhabitants of other universes. I don't think this makes the subject
<br>
moot, though -- the questions whether they exist and what they are like
<br>
can still affect what we should expect to find here, as well as help us
<br>
think about various other subjects.
<br>
<p>Much of the above is either an informed guess or pure speculation; please
<br>
keep taking it with an infinitely large grain of salt and an &quot;IIUC&quot; 
<br>
everywhere.
<br>
<p>Nus
