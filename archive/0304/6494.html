Hi Eliezer
<br>
<p>I'm not going to get into a detailed argument on the merits or flaws of the
<br>
Singularity Action Group.  (Or of the SIAI, which however I will say is a
<br>
much more mature and stable organization at this point.)   But, well, you've
<br>
sucked me into saying a little more...
<br>
<p>I like most of the people involved with SAG on a personal level, I enjoy
<br>
interacting with them, and I appreciate their enthusiasm for the Singularity
<br>
and for AGI.  Frankly, I won't be shocked if something useful comes out of
<br>
the SAG, and I won't be shocked if it doesn't either.
<br>
<p>Those internal SAG conversations that I have been exposed to [not a full
<br>
sample I'm sure], have pertained to topics such as what kinds of tools could
<br>
be created in the near term to aid AGI development in a relatively
<br>
AGI-design-independent way, and have not centered on SIAI or you or such
<br>
&quot;political&quot; topics at all.  So, even if SAG did begin out of frustration
<br>
with SL4 or SIAI, it does not seem to me to be centered on that at present.
<br>
<p>I note that I also booted Alan Grimes temporarily off my AGI list.  And he
<br>
*really* had to work to earn that privilege, because I'm a really tolerant
<br>
list-master ;))
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mike Deering thinks my life is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extended secret plot to infiltrate the most advanced AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects, steal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their secrets, and take over the world;
</em><br>
<p>I take it you don't think this is accurate??  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I strive to avoid sectarianism between serious groups worth taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously, for example, between ExI and WTA.  But I would not wish to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the WTA extending tolerance to crackpot sects such as Raelianism in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name of &quot;avoiding sectarianism&quot;.  The Raelians are crackpots, and so are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alan Grimes and Mike Deering.  I do not consider such to be included in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the community of game-theoretical cooperators among whom tolerance is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.  Such is *my* decision; take it as you will.
</em><br>
<p>The Raelians are definitely on the wrong side of my personal &quot;crackpot&quot;
<br>
threshold!  (Which is a very liberal threshold, because I really dislike
<br>
making harsh judgments of others.)  While I aspire to be helpful to all
<br>
beings, sometimes one has to pick and choose, and I wouldn't choose to spend
<br>
time helping them unless they were about to be squashed by a meteor or
<br>
something!  Fortunately, they don't seem interesting in dabbling in seed AI,
<br>
as least so far ...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
