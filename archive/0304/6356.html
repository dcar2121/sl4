<p>Michael, you probably *do* understand the physics of the
<br>
situation, but your statement is highly misleading.  It
<br>
doesn't matter whether they are moving towards or away
<br>
from each other.  Time dilation is controlled entirely
<br>
by the parameter v, the mutual relative velocity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As soon one cigar smoker changes direction (which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in velocity)
</em><br>
<p>Yes; here the acceleration kicks in for a short time in the
<br>
notorious twin paradox.  But the deeper truth is that the
<br>
acceleration doesn't have any direct effects itself (or
<br>
few), but rather that it puts the person undergoing the
<br>
acc into a different frame of reference.  The moment that
<br>
he obtains a constant velocity, then once again his twin
<br>
ages more slowly than he (in his frame of reference).
<br>
And I emphasize again, that this is not merely appearance;
<br>
his twin really is aging more slowly, as all physical 
<br>
processes occur more slowly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and moves back toward the other, then the second smoker,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is stationary relative to the first one, is seen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed up enormously.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, at that moment.
<br>
