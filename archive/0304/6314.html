<em>&gt; Ok, point by point, I'm going to show how the negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feelings you mentioned can be integrated and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced as positive bliss.
</em><br>
<p>One facet of pain/pleasure I think we should differentiate is that of sensory 
<br>
input whose source is from the physical world, and source from our own mind. I 
<br>
believe as thinking sentients (as opposed to plant life) our brain has eveolved 
<br>
to allow us to recreate sensory input in a virtual manner. Hence the seemingly 
<br>
extraordinary ability for us to apply these techniques of converting the mind's 
<br>
feelings to physical actions and vice versa.

<em>&gt; &gt; In fact, this is a bad thing.  The people with that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; syndrome generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; die in their early 20s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that not feeling pain or any other emotion for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that matter is a bad thing.  My thesis though, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as long as you feel the feeling you are able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; receive all the information that feeling has for you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but more importantly it is possible and desirable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so PLEASURABLY.
</em><br>
<p>As I have mentioned before, the purpose of our pain/pleasure model of our 
<br>
existence is to maximize pleasure and minimize pain. Preferably over the period 
<br>
of our individual lifetime.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; Pain ultimately is intense amounts of energy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emanate from the damaged area to your brain.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people experience this intensity in a negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context, resulting in suffering.  It is possible, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can attest, to experience this energy as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasurable.  Last year I fell off an elevated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; platform, and broke my ankle, and experience some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriois abrasions in several areas.  I immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied everyting I learned in Yoga and Vivation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within 30 seconds began to feel the intense pain, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense pleasure, and because of that was even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accutely aware of the damaged areas, and took great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care to not damage myself further.  According to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctors, I healed almost twice as fast as normal.
</em><br>
<p>A good example of the mind's ability to create what I am calling a virtual 
<br>
sense that increases pleasure, or decreases pain. Pleasure and pain is always 
<br>
what the mind perceives. And this is an example of how changing our perception 
<br>
allows us to physically heal and hence decrease the chance of shortening our 
<br>
lifespan.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Yes, feeling sadness is again important.  But when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sadness is truly integrated, the tears flow, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overwhelming feeling is tranformed into one of deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gratitude.  I lost my father to pancreatic cancer, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first of this year.  As I integrated more and more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the grief, my sense of gratitude deepened, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was able to be truly be present and loving to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; father in his last days.  While I was by his bedside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loving and laughing with my father, most of my family
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were off in their rooms in depression and grief.
</em><br>
<p>Understanding sadness and happiness as integrated together (wholly/holy ?) is 
<br>
an important method for a mind to use to perform this pain/pleasure 
<br>
optimization, and you have discovered that it is a lot more efficient than the 
<br>
typical extended grieving period. Good for you.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; If you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feel anxious, I'm sure I don't have to remind anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in this room that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anxiety gets us to do many things that otherwise we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would not have done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are only two types of fear - rational and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational.  Rational fear is what you feel if you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about to get hit by a truck, and you run to move out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of its way. Most anxiety however, is irrational fear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A good example of irrational fear (anxiety) is stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fright.  When you integrate irrational fears they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transform into feelings of excitement.  Many stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performers and public speakers have learned to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transform their stage fright into excitement, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes them the best in their fields.  Those who can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrate these anxieties fail to achieve greatness on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stage.  Same goes for any other anxiety - its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crippling unless integrated into excitement.  Keep in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind, the feeling itself is not changing, the context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which you choose to experience it does.
</em><br>
<p>Getting hit by a truck (or at least perceiving it) has immediate physical 
<br>
effects that shortens your life span. Fear of performance or what other people 
<br>
think are purely mental that have no direct connection with your survival. That 
<br>
is why we have evolved to have reflexes so that our mind doesn't get in the way 
<br>
and slow us down while we're thinking about our sensory input. Anthony Robbins 
<br>
says FEAR is False Evidence Against Reality. With this description, all fear is 
<br>
irrational. You don't use fear itself as a motivator, you analyze where the 
<br>
fear is coming from and rationally realize the best action to take.
<br>
<p><p><p>Attaching a bunch of cameras and microphones and other sensory input devices to 
<br>
an AI currently does not include the pain/pleasure model that biological 
<br>
sentients such as ourselves experience. If I shine a blindingly bright light 
<br>
into a camera, or permanently remove peripherals from a computer, there is no 
<br>
negative feedback about why this is a bad thing and the AI should try and do 
<br>
something about it. I think that this is the key difference between current AI 
<br>
systems and regular sentients, the pain/pleasure feedback of physical and 
<br>
virtual (mental) sensory inputs.
<br>
