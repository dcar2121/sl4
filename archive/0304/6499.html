Incidentally, I somewhat agree with Samantha that this thread doesn't
<br>
seem to be exceedingly relevant here (in this length, anyway). Still, I
<br>
suppose it is of a somewhat high Shock Level, since somebody described
<br>
the subject as mind-blowing, and it seems that the powers that be agree
<br>
so far, so here's a couple of cents courtesy of yours truly.

<p>Indeed. As someone who is rather persuaded, I wouldn't recommend it if
<br>
you're not sure you can deal with it completely rationally. (I so far
<br>
can't, it seems; not completely.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think this is actually possible.  If we consider the movement from time
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From my viewpoint, it suffices if there's a construct Gary N+1 who
</em><br>
_thinks_ he is a continuation of Gary N but with a desire to eat a
<br>
baby's heart, as I don't see any fundamental reason to believe that
<br>
there's causality or continuity in other than subjective realities. As I
<br>
intuit that Gary N+1 is a self-consistent construct in and of itself, he
<br>
should exist in the set of all possible (and therefore, I intuit,
<br>
actual) realities, as should his victim. (See also Theory of Dust.)
<br>
<p>It should be noted that it is of course nevertheless rational to act as
<br>
though there is some non-subjective causality, unless one is
<br>
_absolutely_ sure that this is not the case, which seems impossible to
<br>
me at this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if I'm utterly wet in this instance, surely one among you can propose

</em><br>
<p>Sorry.
