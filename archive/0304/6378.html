Some excerpts from Congressman Brad Sherman's words in the House Committee 
<br>
on Science hearing on &quot;The Societal Implications of Nanotechnology&quot;, 
<br>
Wednesday, April 9, 2003.
<br>
<p>Mr. Sherman:
<br>
<p>I want to respond to the distinguished chair of the space subcommittee 
<br>
that long before his subcommittee authorized the program that took us into 
<br>
space, the poets made us want to go there.  It is good to have the 
<br>
societal elements (or as he would abbreviate the term: nuts) talking to 
<br>
the scientists at an early stage of this process rather than wait until 
<br>
the end.  I commend the panel for focusing on the fact that one of the 
<br>
things that nanotechnology may bring is new orders of intelligence, 
<br>
whether that's through genetic engineering, perhaps at the nanotechnology 
<br>
level, or non-organic nanotechnology or some combination.
<br>
<p>First, I would point out that intelligence is the most explosive thing in 
<br>
the universe.  There are those who think fusion is the most explosive 
<br>
thing except when you realize that intelligence gave us that fusion. 
<br>
There was less than a decade between when Einstein wrote to Roosevelt of 
<br>
the possibility of a nuclear explosion and when we had to develop a 
<br>
nuclear non-proliferation regime.  Now we are engaged in a regime change 
<br>
as part of that regime.
<br>
<p>About a hundred thousand years ago we saw the last increase in 
<br>
intelligence when Cro-Magnon greeted Neanderthal.  Perhaps the first thing 
<br>
a Neanderthal said upon looking at Cro-Magnon is, &quot;Is that us?&quot;  And I 
<br>
don't know.  And we may be looking at new entities and wondering whether 
<br>
the next intelligence is our progeny, our competitor, or a bit of both.
<br>
<p>You've pointed out that we are going to see massive increases in the 
<br>
spread of knowledge and technology, and I'm confident that humans will be 
<br>
better at curing those things that can be cured by intelligence.  If SARS 
<br>
emerges twenty years from now, you science folks will give us a cure in 
<br>
weeks instead of years.  But, there are problems caused by intelligence: 
<br>
like the fact that we can bombard ... uranium atoms.  And those problems 
<br>
will probably also increase since their cause, human intelligence, increases.
<br>
<p>Mr. Kurzweil, I believe that you have written that it's roughly thirty 
<br>
years between now when we get a non-biological intelligence that surpasses 
<br>
human intelligence and have suggested that that occurs by reverse 
<br>
engineering the human brain.  Since I'm out of time I'm going to ask each 
<br>
panelist how many years they think it will take any of the branches of 
<br>
nanotechnology to give us an intelligence that surpasses any known human 
<br>
intelligence?  Just shout out a number of years and make sure it's longer 
<br>
than anyone will hold you to account for, because we will forget your 
<br>
answer in less than a decade.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil: Twenty-six.
<br>
<p>Colvin:  Twenty-five.
<br>
<p>Winner:  Actually, I hope never.  One of the concerns about nanotechnology 
<br>
and science and engineering in this scale is that it is plowing onward to 
<br>
create a successor species to the human being.  I think when word gets out 
<br>
about this to the general public, they will be profoundly distressed.  And 
<br>
why should public money be spent, I would wonder, to produce an eventual 
<br>
race of post-humans?  Perhaps this needs wider public debate.
<br>
<p>Sherman:  That's pretty much how we spent the last five minutes.  Ms. 
<br>
Peterson.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil:  If I could just suggest that since this has gone into a 
<br>
discussion: we already have people walking around who have computers in 
<br>
their brains, who have Parkinson's disease or hearing disabilities or a 
<br>
dozen different neural implants.  We have artificial augmentations and 
<br>
replacements of almost every body system.  So the ultimate implication of 
<br>
these technologies will not be a successor species, but really an 
<br>
enhancement of our human species.  I would define the human species as 
<br>
that species that inherently seeks to extend our own horizons.  We didn't 
<br>
stay on the ground.  We didn't stay on the planet.  We're not staying with 
<br>
the limitations of our biology.
<br>
<p>Ms. Peterson:  Well, I'll say 25 to 30 years and express my surprise that 
<br>
this question would come up here, and also say that these kinds of things 
<br>
are labeled &quot;science fiction&quot;.  My work is often labeled &quot;science 
<br>
fiction&quot;.  But, I point out that if you look ahead 30 years, and what you 
<br>
see sounds like science fiction, you might be wrong.  But if it doesn't 
<br>
sound like science fiction then you're definitely wrong.
<br>
<p>Sherman:  Dr. Winner and Mr. Kurzweil have addressed from opposite 
<br>
standpoints that interesting question:  What is a human being?  Dr. 
<br>
Kurzweil puts forward the idea that wherever evolution takes us, if it 
<br>
produces a self-aware and ambitious exploring entity, that that is human; 
<br>
and Dr. Winner..., well, I guess he wants to count the fingers and count 
<br>
the toes.  And I don't know if there is a way to address this in the 
<br>
remaining 15 seconds.
<br>
<p>Winner:  One important question is who gets to do the counting at all. 
<br>
The last statistics, I understand there are about 6 billion plus humans on 
<br>
the planet most of whom, the overwhelming majority of whom, are not 
<br>
involved in these projects.  They might be interested to find out that 
<br>
these plans are in the works and they might even want to have a say.
<br>
<p>Sherman:  I think they would, and it does go back to the question as if 
<br>
Mr. Kurzweil were a Neanderthal, and met that Cro-Magnon, whether he would 
<br>
be happy or unhappy?  I'll let him respond if he wants to.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil:  I think rather than developing sentient, non-biological systems 
<br>
(although that will happen), I think our primary destiny is to enhance our 
<br>
own capabilities.  I mean, I like having 10 fingers and 10 toes. 
<br>
Incrementally, one step at a time, as we overcome various types of 
<br>
physical afflictions and limitations of our human capability we'll be 
<br>
enhancing our civilization.  We've done that already.  We're doing things 
<br>
today that couldn't be possible without the intimate merger with our 
<br>
technology and we're going to stay on that path.
