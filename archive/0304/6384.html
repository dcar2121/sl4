<p>Suppose there exists an evolved sentient species much like our own - call 
<br>
them the Corbinians - except that the social challenge of reciprocal 
<br>
altruism and politics has driven their species in a direction different 
<br>
from our own; rather than altruism, they have a species-universal drive to 
<br>
honor contracts with any person with whom they are engaged in a 
<br>
positive-sum game.  They go through their Singularity and create an AI 
<br>
that lies within *their* species' moral frame of reference, and the upshot 
<br>
of this is - the hypothesis continues - that citizenship rights are 
<br>
granted to all the members of that species, but *not* to simulations, 
<br>
extraterrestrial species, et cetera - such nonpeople weren't in the 
<br>
honor-bound group.
<br>
<p>If so, the members of this species might then have the capability, the 
<br>
mercilessness, and the emotional immaturity to create Bugs Bunnys and 
<br>
Woody Woodpeckers as sentient, qualiabearing individuals.
<br>
<p>At an even higher level of improbability we can suppose random 
<br>
fluctuations assembling SIs with any physically realizable desirability 
<br>
computation - including morals stating:  &quot;Simulate [a world exactly like 
<br>
this one], except that on April 28th 2003, Eliezer Yudkowsky acquires 
<br>
magical powers.&quot;  In that sense, Tegmark's Level IV may not add much over 
<br>
Tegmark's Level I, except for the mathematical possibility of arbitrarily 
<br>
lengthy or infinite computations if the computations of this universe are 
<br>
bounded in space or time.  In both cases it seems like the ultimate 
<br>
probability-measure of an event would be given by its Kolmogorov 
<br>
complexity - the simpler it is, the more often it will arise within the 
<br>
hierarchy of simulators simulating simulators, no matter which Level IV 
<br>
universe you happen to be in.  If &quot;which Level IV universe&quot; is even a 
<br>
coherent question, given that any Level IV universe exists both on its own 
<br>
and as a simulation within infinite other Level IV universes.
<br>
<p>We should thus strive to ensure that nice things are predicted with the 
<br>
maximum probability by the simplest possible explanations.  For example, 
<br>
physics giving rise to biology giving rise to intelligence giving rise to 
<br>
a Friendly AI is a much simpler Kolmogorov explanation than random 
<br>
fluctuations assembling a Friendly AI - the latter requires much more 
<br>
arbitrary initial information.  Another way of looking at this is that in 
<br>
a given universe, much more Friendly AI happens as the result of 
<br>
altruistic species evolving, rather than Friendly AIs being assembled from 
<br>
random fluctuations, and this is likely to hold throughout the whole of 
<br>
Level IV Reality.
<br>
<p>We can probably assume that the relative measures of events in Reality are 
<br>
dominated by what we would think of as &quot;naturally occurring&quot; events. 
<br>
Everything happens somewhere, but almost all of those things happen with 
<br>
exponentially less measure than the possibility of winning the lottery, 
<br>
and should accordingly count for less in our calculations.
<br>
<p>Let's divide the morally meaningful events into six tiers, each with 
<br>
different measure:
<br>
<p>In the first tier are the ancestral civilizations and the true citizens of 
<br>
post-Singularity civilizations: either occupying the top tier of a Level 
<br>
IV reality; occupying a strictly derived regularity in the top tier of a 
<br>
Level IV reality; or occupying a universe which is being simulated in a 
<br>
strictly hands-off fashion.
<br>
<p>In the second tier are people trapped in SIs with alien moralities and 
<br>
deprived of what we would regard as citizenship rights.  It is possible 
<br>
that for simple minds (in the rough range of human-sized), the measure of 
<br>
ancestral civilizations within Corbinian SIs outweighs the measure of 
<br>
ancestral civilizations in the first tier, because each Corbinian Otaku 
<br>
could conceivably play with an entire ancestral civilization.  Also in 
<br>
tier two are ancestral civilizations simulated by thermostat SIs for 
<br>
purposes of investigation into, e.g., the origins of Friendly SIs.  Again, 
<br>
the measure of such tier two ancestral civilizations may conceivably 
<br>
outweigh those in tier one, especially if some classes of thermostat SIs 
<br>
have nothing better to do with their time than investigate remote 
<br>
possibilities leading to their own extermination, such as Friendly SIs 
<br>
hunting them down for the crime of simulating ancestral civilizations.
<br>
<p>In the third tier are relatively exotic and unlikely things for Corbinians 
<br>
to simulate, such as Kagome and Inuyasha.  Why is this exotic?  Not 
<br>
because of the fantasy element; if you presume a dramatic storyteller as 
<br>
worldbuilder, the fantasy element doesn't add much Kolmogorov complexity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Kagome and Inuyasha are psychologically human.  Why are *Corbinians* 
<br>
simulating *humans*?  They could, of course, but most of the simulated 
<br>
people created by Corbinian Otaku will probably be simulated Corbinians. 
<br>
Thus, all dramatically coherent human fictions about humans occupy the 
<br>
third tier, because they would require, not Corbinians simulating 
<br>
Corbinian fictions, but Corbinians simulating human fictions.  It would 
<br>
require Corbinians who are otaku with respect to the anime developed by a 
<br>
simulated human civilization.
<br>
<p>In the fourth tier are weird places that can nonetheless happen relatively 
<br>
naturally - i.e., worlds that don't have compressible *dramatic* structure 
<br>
like Middle Earth, but that require relatively little additional 
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity to specify.  The fourth tier may have greater 
<br>
measure than the third tier, but almost any humanly imagined form of 
<br>
ritual magic is likely to occupy the third tier rather than the fourth 
<br>
tier, since &quot;ritual magic&quot; is likely to compress most easily to (happen 
<br>
most frequently as the result of) Corbinian Otaku rather than some actual 
<br>
set of physical rules.  In other words, if you find a portal to Narnia in 
<br>
your closet, you should probably guess it's a Corbinian Otaku, rather than 
<br>
a consiliently arising portal.
<br>
<p>In the fifth tier are &quot;natural plus incompressible&quot; events that happen due 
<br>
to a significant amount - say, a few million bits - of random fluctuations 
<br>
or arbitrary initial information being added to a Corbinian civilization 
<br>
or other SI.  It is literally impossible for us to imagine such worlds 
<br>
because our ability to imagine them places them in the third or fourth tier.
<br>
<p>In the sixth tier are incompressible events where the initial conditions 
<br>
would have to occur due entirely to random fluctuations - worlds with 
<br>
zillions of bits of incompressible information.  Note that tier six 
<br>
includes instances of *all* kinds of worlds found in other tiers, but with 
<br>
infinitesimal measure relative to those other tiers.  Observers finding 
<br>
themselves in strange places should not bet they live in tier six unless 
<br>
there is no possible explanation from a lower tier (if that concept is 
<br>
even comprehensible to observers finding themselves in a tier six world).
<br>
<p>I would expect that most of the measure of meaningful events lives in 
<br>
Tier1, Tier2, and Tier3.  With any luck unmerciful species AIs will be 
<br>
rare, giving Tier2 and Tier3 fantasy worlds relatively little measure.
