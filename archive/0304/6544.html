<em>&gt; As far as philanthropy goes, that doesn't seem like a likely source,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even with the credentials.  Philanthropists generally give money to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes they understand (which pretty much rules out SIAI).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Philanthropy also provides a fairly tiny amount of money when compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the other two sources, and that proportion is shrinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So then the other realistic source of funding is grants.  Granting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agencies like credentials.  They like PhDs and publications in peer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reviewed journals.  As Ben said, these credentials don't necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be yours, but they're useful for someone on the team to have.
</em><br>
<p>What I have found is that scientific/technical philanthropists also like
<br>
credentials...
<br>
<p>Ideally, they like you to be an established scientist who has gotten grants
<br>
or industry funding and done mainstream research -- and THEN gone in a
<br>
slightly more adventurous direction, which the grant-funding bodies are too
<br>
conservative to fund....  Then the philanthropist can step in and feel like
<br>
they're being adventurous and supporting maverick work!  But they have
<br>
confidence the maverick work is good because the people involved have
<br>
already proven themselves doing more &quot;academically acceptable&quot; work.
<br>
<p>Also, rather than &quot;philanthropists give money to causes they understand&quot;,
<br>
I'd say &quot;philanthropists give money to causes they FEEL LIKE they
<br>
understand.&quot;  The actual understanding doesn't have to be there, or can be
<br>
very shallow....  Many wealthy science buffs are really good at convincing
<br>
themselves they understand more than they actually do [well -- Ok -- a lot
<br>
of other humans have this trait too!!]
<br>
<p>A well-received book on Friendly AI could well be enough to garner some SIAI
<br>
funding from one of the few-dozen significant science-oriented
<br>
philanthropists in the US....
