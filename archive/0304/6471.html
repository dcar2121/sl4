</em><br>
<p>You are assuming that intuition stays bound to some
<br>
evolutionary constraints. If that was the case then no
<br>
one have a proper understanding of gravity beyond the
<br>
behaviour of everyday objects on Earth and Einstein
<br>
would not have been able to formulate his general
<br>
theory of relativity. I am not saying that everyone's
<br>
intuition is correct, that certainly could not be the
<br>
case because everyone seems to have different
<br>
intuitions (although if you believe in an
<br>
observer-relative reality perhaps this is still
<br>
possible). However it is possible to develop intuition
<br>
in the same way that other brain areas can be trained
<br>
to develop certain skills. Mathematicians with highly
<br>
developed intuitions in their field are able to come
<br>
up with some amazing mathematics for instance, often
<br>
opening up whole new avenues of investigation: this is
<br>
where Mathematician meets creative genius and its all
<br>
thanks to intuition. Similiarly for philosophers,
<br>
logicians and metaphysicians: intuition is the tool
<br>
used to navigate the complex, the abstract, the
<br>
esoteric realms of mind in order to reach a personal
<br>
understanding, and allow for those intial creative
<br>
sparks to get us further up the ladder of
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Einstein and Goedel would agree with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say that they would both most certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with you.
</em><br>
<p>Did you know that both Einstein and Goedel were good
<br>
friends at one point and they were known to share a
<br>
philosophy which included simple mysticism? Goedel
<br>
himself claimed to have mystical insights into such
<br>
things as absolute negation. &quot;mystical insights&quot; -
<br>
otherwise known as intuition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As to my background in metamathematics, most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what i
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have a currently garnered on the subject so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been from reading Rudy Rucker's nonfiction series 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; =}
</em><br>
Spike: for your information titles include &quot;Mind Tools
<br>
and the Fifth Dimension&quot; and &quot;Infinity and the Mind&quot;,
<br>
i recommend the latter, its a very entertaining and
<br>
enlightening read which includes such great chapters
<br>
as &quot;Robots and Souls&quot; -which is very relevant to AI.
<br>
<p>Simon.
