</em><br>
<p>Possibly, just as there are a countably infinite number of formal
<br>
systems capable of expressing real numbers, which are themselves not
<br>
countable. I suspect this is not the case (see below) but it may be --
<br>
I don't have anything approaching a proof.
<br>
<p>Tegmark makes the interesting point, you might note, that the vast
<br>
complexity of our universe might evolve from essentially no
<br>
information at all. Any given one of our universes has vast
<br>
Chaitin-Kolmogrov information even though the ensemble has nearly
<br>
none, just as a given 20,000,000 digit prime has large
<br>
Chaitin-Kolmogrov information compared to the entire set of integers!
<br>
<p>We should not be surprised that a given formal system is capable of
<br>
containing things &quot;bigger than itself&quot;. :) Formal systems are somewhat
<br>
like TARDISes in this regard. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There may be uncountably many universes contained in other Level IV
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Processes - for example, a Process might contain universes that run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on reals or fields of reals.
</em><br>
<p>Well, merely because the universes have as part of their mathematical
<br>
structure real numbers doesn't mean that you end up with a transfinite
<br>
number of universes within the Level IV container.
<br>
<p>Consider that you need to express initial conditions within your
<br>
formal system itself. That means that it appears that you would need
<br>
to use only constructible entities -- Pi is fine, but arbitrary reals
<br>
are not, because no formal system can capture them specifically within
<br>
its axioms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, Bayesia itself appears to be made up of fields of real and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex numbers, but in a way that leads to only countably many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes.
</em><br>
<p>That may very well be a consequence of the above -- that you can make
<br>
the reals part of the operation of the formal system but not part of
<br>
its initial axioms because (of course) axioms have to be finite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, Bayesia consists of datums of possible diversity aleph-two (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum fields),
</em><br>
<p>Wait, why are you assuming the quantum fields have a diversity of
<br>
aleph two? It isn't even clear to me that they have a diversity of
<br>
aleph one -- they might very well be countable. I followed what you
<br>
were saying fine up until there, but it suddenly skipped.
