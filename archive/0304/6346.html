<em>&gt; &quot;No, I know that part already. What I don't understand is why it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a violation of special or general relativity for that to happen -- so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far as I knew your relative speed to another object in space could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never exceed c. (Or perhaps it is okay because of physics I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know. I was sort of reaching for more detail on this.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not 100% sure on this myself, but I think it has do to with the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the universe was expanding, which is different from objects moving.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you were &quot;moving&quot; away from another object because of universal expansion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would not have any gain in kinetic energy as a result of the expansion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You wouldn't be in motion at all.
</em><br>
<p>In special relativity, I view myself as still always. I see the other
<br>
guy as moving. Since I see him as moving, I view him as having
<br>
kinetic energy. (I must admit I'm not entirely clear on the notion of
<br>
measuring space without reference to objects within the space...)
<br>
<p>BTW, this is why in special relativity, if I have two objects that
<br>
have time bombs on them that will blow them up after ten seconds
<br>
(relative to the local frame of reference), and we send one of them at
<br>
high speed past the other, the observer on each of the objects
<br>
perceives himself as still, and therefore sees time as dilated for the
<br>
other guy, so both think the other blows up first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, I could be wrong, but I think this is a good analogy: imagine you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a flat sheet of infinitely flexible material.  Well, not on the sheet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but embedded within the sheet, with no way of escaping.  You are at one end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the sheet, and want to travel to the other end.  If the sheet is deformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the 3rd dimension, stretching it out, the distance between them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases with no velocity change in the objects relative or absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; velocity.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but I was under the impression that the average geometry of the
<br>
expanding universe we're in is flat...
