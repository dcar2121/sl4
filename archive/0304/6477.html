Somewhere in the Northeast....
<br>
<p>This is the last thing I'm posting here until at least 18:00
<br>
<p>I have better things to do.   A smallish group of friends and I are going to
<br>
try to start an informal, *fun* research group. Like meet at a local
<br>
community college during an empty time slot, use their projectors, vidcams,
<br>
and recorders, whatever.... The specific one I refer to is strong affiliated
<br>
with Temple U...my best friend is studying (philosophy???) there, and gets
<br>
straight As.
<br>
<p>She knows a lot of the PhD's that teach there....
<br>
<p>Well do what Douglas Hofstadter did at U of Oregon and U of Indiana
<br>
But open to all
<br>
ALL
<br>
And it's going to be the most fun I've ever had.
<br>
<p>Hey, if you live around here (where am I?):) Come join us
<br>
Anyone can come, even my best friends' identical twins' *Literally*
<br>
*SKINHEAD* HUSBAND
<br>
Even my uncle, bio - maternal full sib...top in class 68? Full scholarship
<br>
to PSU...  Dropped out, married a white trash RN at local [not to me]
<br>
(where?) Hospital, she cheats on him with doctor, they marry, only child,
<br>
12F deeply intelligent diagnosis to death of acute mayo leukemia, &lt; 1yr,
<br>
descent to alcoholism and drug addiction, bankruptcy, jail, jail, dui,
<br>
garbage man, *good person* for a Girlfriend, Mental abuse she leaves he
<br>
drinks more,
<br>
<p>2 yrs ago
<br>
<p>He is a fundamentalist apocalyptic
<br>
Drinks, (maybe) drugs,
<br>
Is coached on phone with his own nephew by minister (Pentecostal?
<br>
Evangelical?)
<br>
To tell me unless I embrace Jesus cancer will kill me because his daughter
<br>
was a sinner and so am I and I will die, go to hell for eternity for
<br>
atrocity of being religiously open-minded (Not Naïve)
<br>
<p>I gave him 2 drunken, ranting hours long distance at my expense
<br>
<p>Haven't talked to him since
<br>
<p><p>HE MAY COME
<br>
<p><p>Posers out! (You can come back later after you chill a bit)
<br>
I have no idea what the fuck this 200K .GIF means, could someone give me a
<br>
better idea than some vague suspicions I currently have?  It would be
<br>
greatly appreciated:)
