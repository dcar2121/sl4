It was Mark Waser (not me) who originally wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose it's twenty years in the future and I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing the newest total immersion version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this game.  I'm booted out of the game once it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent that my character is about to die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horribly but everyone else &quot;sees&quot; me die horribly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this morally wrong?
</em><br>
<p>Let me jump in and opine &quot;No&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose that for the ultimate in realism and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly &quot;live the game&quot;, I've decided to accept the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporary blockage of all outside-game knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until I &quot;die&quot; inside the game, I won't remember/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know about anything outside the game, but once I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;die&quot;, I will go on living my normal life outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the game.  Is this morally wrong (Assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're advanced enough that there is no way in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which in-game events can harm, much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traumatize, my outside-game self)?
</em><br>
<p>Again, I would opine &quot;No&quot;.  You have your own possibly
<br>
non-computable interpretations of pain/pleasure, and
<br>
you're  right now the best---and perhaps ultimate---judge.
<br>
<p>Paul responded differently to Mark's question:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was amazed when I first read this, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had thoughts along these lines... Firstly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's go to the uber-video-game universe where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're completely immersed, with your memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your real-self blocked out temporarily, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all you can remember is memories from the game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your character dies in the game, but you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pulled out the instant before death and experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no pain (or a minimal amount), but all the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; players believe that you are indeed dead and gone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then this is definitely morally wrong, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumably some of the other players will feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental anguish at your loss, which is suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for them...
</em><br>
<p>Well!  Then!  You fix the problem where the problem
<br>
is, not where it is not!  The problem is that they
<br>
are reality-challenged here, and think that something
<br>
has happened which has not happened.  Although no one
<br>
should keep lying to them, it's really their own
<br>
responsibility to learn the truth.
<br>
<p>Paul continues
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I'm getting at here is, at what point is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally reprehensible to kill an AI in a video
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game?  Most people would just laugh this notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off, but I'm serious here. 
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer and I have a long-standing disagreement about
<br>
one of the aspects of this question.  As for me, if
<br>
you own the resources the AI is running on, then as
<br>
it's on your nickel, you can provide it as much or
<br>
as little runtime---perhaps parsed out by the second
<br>
over millennia---as you choose.  (I believe that E.Y.
<br>
thinks that even if a creature has only come into
<br>
existence during the last nanosecond, its legal rights 
<br>
ought to be as inalienable as ours, no matter who
<br>
brought the creature into existence.)
<br>
<p>But if the AI does not belong to you, and has licensed
<br>
its resources (its runtime) accordingly from some other
<br>
provider, not only should you *not* off it, you should
<br>
not even be *able* to off it.
<br>
<p>I have also heard it argued that whether or not the
<br>
entity cares whether it lives or dies is relevant.
<br>
Possibly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With really no one other than myself considering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such possibilities,
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're not alone!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I could very well see the whole Roman-arena thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening in the future again.  I.e., we look back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now and say &quot;how could the Romans actually watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and enjoy real people being torn to pieces before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their very eyes?&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>It's a good question.  I thought that they inherited
<br>
some compassion from their hunter-gatherer ancestors,
<br>
but sometimes the historical record hardly shows it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but perhaps in the future sentients will say about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us &quot;how could the homo sapiens sapiens actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watch and enjoy real sentients being torn to pieces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before their very eyes?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I presume from the structure of your question that the
<br>
sentients find this a painful process.  In that case,
<br>
it's unacceptable.  Gratuitous suffering is always
<br>
unacceptable, and is to be vigorously denounced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although it's possible that I really never was sick,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the Mongol invasion of China or World War II never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened, that they were all just &quot;backstaging&quot; set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up by the programmers (Gods) of the game, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still doesn't mean there isn't suffering.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the two ideas are not connected.  Simulations could
<br>
be with or without actual suffering.  It's exceedingly
<br>
improbable that this is *only* a simulation, but it's
<br>
even more improbable that our suffering is delusional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I stab myself right now, I'm quite confident that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll feel pain and suffer; it's not just some memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implanted there by the God running this game.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if the God(s) did exist, and if they ran such
<br>
pointless games---two extraordinarily big &quot;ifs&quot;---
<br>
then it could happen that you would not suffer, but
<br>
only later have memories of having suffered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this is a game, why do we have to suffer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To make it seem &quot;realistic&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Nah.  The whole boatload of crap about this being some
<br>
kind of game, or that Jehovah exists and allows suffering
<br>
for a Divine but Inscrutable reason just has to be dumped.
<br>
All the apologists for suffering should IMO do some
<br>
serious soul-searching.
