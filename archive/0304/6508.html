<br>
<em>&gt; So why would compassion and empathy require me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disbelieve in Tegmark's IV, assuming it to be true?
</em><br>
<p>Advanced SI beings may desire &quot;ignorance holidays&quot; in
<br>
the same way that many adult human beings desire to
<br>
re-live their childhood -- perhaps to regain their
<br>
innocence, or to repeat the losing of their innocence,
<br>
or simply to enjoy a different level of fun. 
<br>
Shifting one's worldview from the 'one universe is
<br>
all' perspective to the 'all possible worlds exist'
<br>
perspective represents a similiar loss of innocence
<br>
(and a gain of understanding), albeit of an
<br>
intellectual kind rather than sexual, but as we know
<br>
this revelatory perspective shift has its downside:
<br>
namely the accompanying awareness of Hell worlds.
<br>
<p>The problem with Tegmarks ultimate ensemble is that no
<br>
matter how hard you try there is absolutely nothing
<br>
you can do to get rid of all the Hell worlds, and you
<br>
can never turn the subjective probability of a Hell
<br>
scenario happening to any given being into a zero.
<br>
Which means that somewhere out there are perfectly
<br>
innocent beings going through absolute Hells, much
<br>
worse than Dante could have ever envisaged, and this
<br>
is happening in a very real sense (there's even an
<br>
infinite ensemble of copies of you which will fall
<br>
into a Hell scenario in the next 10 seconds). As
<br>
Eliezer remarks, the best we can do is to reduce the
<br>
subjective conditional probabilites as much as
<br>
possible but it can never become zero. We assume then
<br>
that every intelligent being will do the upmost to
<br>
reduce the subjective probabilities of Hell for
<br>
everyone, this is just exactly what happens naturally
<br>
when we are all empathetic towards each other.
<br>
<p>Empathy here is used in the weak sense of simply
<br>
&quot;understanding the feelings that others beings are
<br>
experiencing&quot; and this is how it is defined in most
<br>
dictionaries i believe. This is what i would call low
<br>
empathy; as far as i know most if not all humans have
<br>
very low empathy i.e. they do not really feel other
<br>
peoples pain they just claim they understand how it
<br>
must feel like to have their pain. I believe to truly
<br>
understand someones pain you have to directly
<br>
experiance it because pain is a qualia like the colour
<br>
blue and how can i understand the feeling you get from
<br>
the colour blue if i havent at least temporarily
<br>
visited your subjective experiance of the colour blue.
<br>
I believe this kind of objective empathy can be
<br>
achieved through simulation.
<br>
<p>An SI advanced being may well be able to construct and
<br>
visualise an entire map of the multiverse, certainly
<br>
not a perfect map as that would require the entire
<br>
information of the multiverse, but a detailed
<br>
representational map nevertheless. They would then be
<br>
able to &quot;see&quot; a representation of that infinitesimal
<br>
fragment of the multiverse unavoidably occupied by
<br>
subjective hells. Naturally their compassion and
<br>
heightened empathy would extend to those beings
<br>
undergoing the most suffering; would they be able to
<br>
avoid the temptation of running empathy simulations of
<br>
those Hell worlds?
<br>
<p>This combination of super intelligence and amplified
<br>
empathy raises the disturbing possibility that such
<br>
advanced sentients may become engrossed in
<br>
empathasizing for those few sentients who necessarily
<br>
suffer on the cusp of infinitisimalism. This is why i
<br>
propose that &quot;ignorance holidays&quot; may not be such a
<br>
bad idea. You could either restrict intelligence to
<br>
some degree, or restrict empathy to some degree as
<br>
those restrictions should avoid the problem
<br>
altogether, but i suggest that simply restricting
<br>
certain nodes of knowledge might be a better idea, and
<br>
then only for a limited amount of time.
<br>
<p>Simon.
