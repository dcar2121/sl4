<em>&gt; By selectively considering your responses to situations that, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;theoretically&quot; possible, are only likely in fiction, you can end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distorting your mentally precomputed reflexes away from the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt; Try keeping track of how many times people casually reason from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictional evidence - &quot;Brave New World&quot; cited in discussions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning, &quot;The Matrix&quot; in discussions of AI, &quot;the Borg&quot; in discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human-machine interfaces.  Humans don't have strong safeguards to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent reasoning from fictional evidence; we know the particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story isn't true, but we easily pick up our concepts, our categories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way we chunk the world, by generalizing concepts from fictional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences.  Generalizing your categories from fictional evidence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as much a mistake as treating &quot;Brave New World&quot; as a history book.
</em><br>
<p>I both agree and disagree. Since repeating what has been said would
<br>
not be very interesting, let me explain the sense in which I disagree
<br>
(and people can take as given that I partially agree with Eliezer).
<br>
<p>I think Science Fiction has also had the salutary effect of making
<br>
people's minds more flexible. The &quot;imagine the world not as it is
<br>
today, but in a variety of potential future scenarios in which it
<br>
would look completely different than it does right now&quot; tool is a
<br>
powerful one, and Science Fiction exercises that ability in people.
<br>
<p>A few centuries ago, no one expected any fundamental change in the
<br>
circumstances of life around them even in the far future. Even the
<br>
rate of change experienced by people in the early part of the 20th
<br>
century was slow enough that people didn't expect change. If you had a
<br>
disease in 1940 you didn't expect a new cure to be found. If you had a
<br>
kid in 1930 or even 1950 you expected her life would be much like your
<br>
own life.
<br>
<p>Now, of course, many (though certainly not most) people no longer
<br>
expect a future that looks like the present, and I think Science
<br>
Fiction has played a role in helping people accept that idea. It
<br>
trains you to ask &quot;what if&quot; a lot, and there's substantial benefit in
<br>
that. I wonder if most of us with that-outlook-which-we-seem-to-have
<br>
would have gotten here without the mental exercise that resulted in
<br>
hypertrophy of the &quot;what if the rules change&quot; parts of our minds.
<br>
<p>Of course, there really isn't any way to answer this absolutely, as
<br>
with most such questions. Unlike, say, trying to determine the
<br>
weight of a protein in daltons, there is no methodology or scale to
<br>
measure the value or trouble caused by SF.
