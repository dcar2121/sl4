<em>&gt; Well, I was talking level 4 &quot;all mathematical/subjective experiances&quot;

<em>&gt; exist, not level three &quot;many worlds interpretation&quot; but the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing is here too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let U be the grand universal wave function. ie, the actual (level 3)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiverse as a whole.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P(a1|U) has a certain value. P(a2|U) has a certain other value. U
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply is what it is. U can be viewed as the sum of a1 and a2 and b
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on and so on, and P(a2|b) may be less than P(a2|U), but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in no way changes U itself.
</em><br>
<p>You're *within* U.  *You yourself* are part of the play and flow of 
<br>
probabilities.  In the moment when you decide whether to help or hurt 
<br>
someone, that decision is embodied in the flow of the probability 
<br>
amplitudes, and the future correlates with your decision.  Of course the 
<br>
future is determined.  It's determined by the probability amplitudes. 
<br>
It's determined by you.  It's determined by your decision.  All these 
<br>
statements are equivalent.
<br>
<p>The timeless form of the decision rule is that given choices A vs. B, you 
<br>
should consider the state of the multiverse given that your decision is A, 
<br>
versus its state given that your decision is B, then pick whichever choice 
<br>
corresponds to the more desirable state.  Only correlation is necessary - 
<br>
not &quot;time&quot; or &quot;causality&quot;.  Note that this resolves Newcomb's Paradox.
<br>
<p>Making &quot;meaningful choices&quot; means that the computation embodying your 
<br>
decision is what determines the future.  To make meaningful choices, the 
<br>
future must be determined by &quot;mere&quot; physics, and we ourselves must be 
<br>
&quot;mere&quot; physics, because only in this way can *we* determine the future. 
<br>
The future is determined; it's determined by the physical process that is 
<br>
your choice, now.  Knowing in the abstract that the future is determined 
<br>
is not the same as knowing *what* the future is determined to be; the 
<br>
future is determined by you, yourself, making a choice under uncertainty. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't yet know your choice, you can't possibly know the 
<br>
deterministic future, because what the future is determined by, is your 
<br>
choice.
<br>
<p>Your choice at T+1 is determined by the physical process at time T that is 
<br>
your mind, but at time T, that physical process doesn't yet internally 
<br>
represent (&quot;know&quot;) what its choice will be, so it doesn't internally 
<br>
represent (&quot;know&quot;) the outcome at time T+2 of any processes determined by 
<br>
that choice.  The outcome at time T+2 is determined by the computations of 
<br>
a cognitive process at T which does not yet know its own decision at T+1. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's what we call &quot;free will&quot;.  Note the noncoincidental resemblance 
<br>
to the halting problem.
<br>
<p>Now you can get messed up if you know the abstract fact that the future is 
<br>
determined by physics, and you think of &quot;physics&quot; as something outside 
<br>
yourself, rather than a system that includes you as a part.  You may get 
<br>
the idea that the future is dependent on something other than your 
<br>
decisions, or that your decisions are determined by something other than 
<br>
your own cognition under uncertainty.
