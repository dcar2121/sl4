<p>I'm unpersuaded for reasons I'll get to in a moment.  I should confess that I
<br>
most particularly don't _want_ to be persuaded.  Seems to me the implication is
<br>
utterly horrible: every evil, monstrous act that could conceivably be
<br>
perpetrated must have happened -- somewhere.  For this to be true, every exact
<br>
doppelganger of me which exists at this time, N, there must be an infinite
<br>
number who 'choose' to do some completely irrational, horrible thing at time N +
<br>
1.
<br>
<p>I don't think this is actually possible.  If we consider the movement from time
<br>
N to N + 1 as a state change, my contention is that some state changes are
<br>
constrained.  Any arrangement of atoms and molecules configured at time N as
<br>
_me_ is not, for instance, going to move at N + 1 to a state that cuts open the
<br>
next baby it sees to see if it likes the taste of baby heart.  It's not just a
<br>
low probability event, it's a zero probability event.
<br>
<p>The whole point of designing a 'friendly' AI is based on the presumption that
<br>
it's possible to succeed -- which means that the AI, designed properly in the
<br>
first instance, has zero chance of becoming unfriendly.  At a lower level, if I
<br>
create a program to print out the integers, there are some ways I could err, but
<br>
it has zero chance of printing the works of Shakespeare instead.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this is obvious.
<br>
<p>The point is that estimating the maximum distance to my nearest doppelganger by
<br>
first computing the number of Hubble bubble's it would take to instantiate every
<br>
possible state within a Hubble bubble places an upper bound on the distance but
<br>
is very far from establishing that every imaginable configuration of states is a
<br>
_reachable_ state in state space under the state transition rules that represent
<br>
the laws of physics.
<br>
<p>That I exist is an instance proof that there is at least one set of state
<br>
transitions that could lead from conditions at the beginning to me.  So,
<br>
granting the assumptions, there may in fact be doppelgangers of me out there and
<br>
very likely much closer than the estimate given. (Because the number of
<br>
_reachable_ states in state space is very much less than the number of
<br>
imaginable states.)
<br>
<p>But -- maybe not, either.  The simplifying assumption leading to the
<br>
doppelganger hypothesis was nearly uniform mass distribution and infinite space
<br>
containing, logically, an infinite number of Hubble Bubbles with _exactly_
<br>
identical initial particle distributions.  The presumption seems to be that
<br>
given identical mass distributions, events would proceed, deterministically, in
<br>
identical ways, thus leading to doppelgangers for those volumes with initial
<br>
distributions (and temperatures) equal to our own.
<br>
<p>There is at least one unstated assumption: that position, relative to the center
<br>
of the inflation, has no influence on subsequent events and that, therefore,
<br>
it's reasonable to expect particle interaction to proceed identically in
<br>
different 'equivalent' bubbles.  This might be true.  But it might not be true,
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>I certainly don't have the math or physics to understand the inflationary
<br>
universe idea with any depth.  Still, it seems that if we stipulate inflation,
<br>
there is _some_ equivalent of motion and, if so, every particle might have it's
<br>
own unique starting vector so that even if 'initial conditions' were
<br>
positionally equivalent for two distinct volumes at some early time T, then
<br>
those two volumes would be positionally _much_ different at time T + 1.
<br>
<p>Even if I'm utterly wet in this instance, surely one among you can propose
<br>
something plausible that leads neither to horror nor unimaginably tedious
<br>
redundancy.
<br>
<p>G.
