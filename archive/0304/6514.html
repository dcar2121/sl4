<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; This led me to speculate that most of the universe is made up of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; copies of Lee Corbin, since only he can be consensually simulated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is the best news I've heard all day.  I sure hope you're right!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's some even better news.  Your volition is such that you allow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself to be consensually simulated (especially if you are in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial environment).
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This means that the *proportion* of Lee Corbins experiencing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are experiencing right now, who are actually living within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI, may be much higher than the proportion of Eliezers, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perrys, and Michaels who are living within Friendly AIs.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not really trying to hog anything here.  But if that's how
<br>
it is, I'll be the last to complain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, there may be more measure in simulated Lee Corbins than real ones,
</em><br>
<p>As if I care a whit
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or more measure in FAI-simulated Lee Corbins than real and UFAI-simulated ones.
</em><br>
<p>However the run time is generated is fine.  Besides, I probably *deserve*
<br>
it.  My mother was the last of ten children and my father was 5th of six,
<br>
and *so* unlikely is it that one's grandparents would have persevered that
<br>
far, that I don't get much run time in our 20th-21st century type civilizations.
<br>
Seeing as how this is the case, I hereby petition the Eliezers running the FAI's
<br>
to up my allotment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given your outlook on life, and the way you expect the future to go, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should estimate an interestingly high probability that you are in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI right now.  I, and those others unfortunate enough to lack a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corbinian morality, are stuck in the desert of the real.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, you're the *only* person you know who believes it's okay to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I'm sure that there are many others!  A lot of people just
<br>
haven't considered the question.
<br>
<p>It's difficult to understand why anyone would be against the idea,
<br>
but I think that it has to do with too little faith in others:
<br>
they automatically assume that a simulator has little better to
<br>
do than torture them.  Another source is a perverted utility curve:
<br>
they cannot bring themselves to imagine extreme pleasure as easily
<br>
as they imagine extreme pain.
<br>
<p>(On this latter point, of course this is just a consequence of
<br>
our primitive technology: it's real easy to hurt naturally evolved
<br>
bodies, and somewhat difficult to pleasure them---why, we almost
<br>
don't even have a word for it.  Also, primitive creatures have
<br>
little capability to control their environment and none to control
<br>
the chemical states of their own brains.  All this will shortly change.
<br>
The bottom line is:  energy + intelligence -&gt; happiness.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, how likely is that?  Isn't it just a little bit... contrived?
</em><br>
<p>You are starting to scare me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...maybe you should just ask to be let out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It can't hurt, can it?
</em><br>
<p>Yes it can!  I don't want to cause no trouble.  (Hear that, 
<br>
nice simulator?)  You just do whatever you are doing now, 
<br>
everything is *fine* in here.  I'm quite happy and am delighted
<br>
at your exceptional thoughtfulness and kindness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I and all the others on this list should expect to see you report that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't work - but for *you*, maybe it will.  If you really mean it.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but it'll be a cold day in hell before I ask anyone to 
<br>
stop stimulating me.  (Oops, I meant simulate.)  
<br>
<p>Lee
