<em>&gt; Instead of the roundabout strategy of writing a book on rationalism,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Writing a book on your AI and FAI ideas?
</em><br>
<p>I have the feeling no one would understand them unless I write the book on 
<br>
rationality first.  One of the questions leading up to this has been me 
<br>
asking myself:  &quot;Why haven't more people understood what's out there 
<br>
already?  Why is no one extending these ideas?&quot;  And my conclusion is that 
<br>
what I've written is the final output of a thinking process which has not 
<br>
itself been explained.  When I see people trying to extend the ideas 
<br>
currently out there, I see them getting stuck on basic mistakes that I 
<br>
dealt with long before I started writing AI papers.  So I need to go back 
<br>
to fundamentals.
<br>
<p>Everything James Rogers says is also correct.  (Except that I hope the 
<br>
tome won't be all *that* immense.  Perhaps this is merely foolish idealism 
<br>
on my part.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) Publishing your AI and FAI ideas in AI journals? 
</em><br>
<p>Evolutionary psychology journals, perhaps.  &quot;Brain and the Behavioral 
<br>
Sciences&quot;, perhaps.  Even a journal on Bayesian information theory. 
<br>
Certainly not AI journals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Pursuing a PhD in AI? (which would force you to do #2)
</em><br>
<p>I've discussed this before and am really not all that interested in taking 
<br>
it up again.  I don't consider this the best use of my time.  I'm not 
<br>
getting a PhD.  You can get a PhD if you like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any or all of the above would have the advantages of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) Spreading your ideas to other people working in AI.  FAI could go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a project that you and a few other people are working on to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream consideration for AI work. This would seem to reduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall risk of a non-friendly AI being inadvertently built by some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other AI research group.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, I have recently become less and less certain that this will 
<br>
actually work.  As Friendly AI theory has developed, it has become clear 
<br>
that this is not something you can do correctly based on a few vague 
<br>
admonitions.  It is not something you can do by working from someone 
<br>
else's theory that you don't really understand.  It is not something that 
<br>
you can do using a few extra modules.  Any AI group that does not spend 
<br>
years thinking about FAI and then build their AI from the ground up using 
<br>
a deeply understood detailed correct theory of Friendly AI will not build 
<br>
a Friendly AI, period.
<br>
<p>It'd buy some time.  Not much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; b) Giving you more direct credibility.  Scientific publications,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical books, and mainstream credentials all increase your ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to raise funds from private sources, acquire funds in the form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grants, and convince others of your ideas.
</em><br>
<p>They increase them very little.  I'd rather talk directly to rationalists, 
<br>
than try (and fail) to persuade nonrationalists by arguments from authority.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A book on rationalism seems very low leverage to me.  It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically target people with the skills to work on FAI or people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the potential resources and inclination to help fund FAI.
</em><br>
<p>Having thought about exactly that problem, I concluded that a book on 
<br>
rationality targets such people far more precisely than a book on AI.  If 
<br>
someone is currently interested in AI, it means they have a head stuffed 
<br>
full of the misleading information that currently predominates in the 
<br>
field - philosophicalish anti-knowledge.  What's needed for AI work are 
<br>
abilities which are more likely to make their bearers interested in 
<br>
rationality than in the wasteland of modern AI.  See:
