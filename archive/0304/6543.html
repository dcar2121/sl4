<p><em>&gt; The reason i am more concerned with Hell worlds than

<p>!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As humans it is natural for us to react more to those

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's a good point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given what i have said above how our empathy works:
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems with this &quot;necessary-ness&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm beginning to think that at some stage, when advanced

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree.  For the very reasons you point out, they *ought*
<br>
to abandon their empathy anchors.  I would think it possible
<br>
to be enormously sympathetic without being empathetic.
<br>
(Alas, perhaps some only achieve the former by means
<br>
of the latter.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest that in order for these future beings to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep their anthropic empathy they will have to target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it elsewhere, to those beings that actually suffer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I see the obvious target of this as the necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cusp of suffering implied by the Level IV multiverse.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you say Level IV here?  Wouldn't the earlier
<br>
levels suffice?  (They're certainly easier for *me*
<br>
to visualize.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All such worlds would be accessible by simulation, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the need for advanced beings to express their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heightened humanlike empathy may end up becoming quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a morbid pastime, as beings try to simulate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling of being in a Hell world and experiencing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense pain.
</em><br>
<p>This does indeed seem both cruel and unwise!
