<p>
In &quot;The limits of complexity &amp; change,&quot; May-June 2003 The Futurist
<br>
(<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/tmodis/Futurist.pdf">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/tmodis/Futurist.pdf</a>), Theodore
<br>
Modis presents a logistic model of complexity that asserts that &quot;the
<br>
rate of change may soon slow down.&quot; He sets the peak of complexity
<br>
growth (inflection point) at 1990, which is when, he believes,
<br>
&quot;complexity grew at the highest rate ever,&quot; after which complexity's
<br>
rate of change (but not cumulative growth) began decreasing. He bases
<br>
this on:
<br>
<p>1. An analysis of 28 important canonical milestones that represent peak
<br>
complexity increases over the past 15 billion years and the ensuing
<br>
stasis, where importance = change in complexity x duration of ensuing
<br>
stasis.
<br>
<p>2. An overall historic &quot;logistic&quot; or S-curve model of complexity based
<br>
on punctuated equilibrium. This model is assumes Darwinian competition,
<br>
i.e., limited resources, so the rate of growth vs. time follows a bell
<br>
curve and the assumption that we are currently (circa 2000) just past
<br>
the inflection point (peak of the bell curve). He bases this on an a
<br>
priori philosophical principle of complexity (&quot;the evolution of
<br>
complexity in the universe has been following a logistic growth pattern
<br>
from the very beginning&quot;), rather than on a specific analysis of current
<br>
resource limitations and their possible effects. &quot;The next world-shaking
<br>
milestone should be expected around 2038,&quot; he says, based on the above
<br>
formula. 
<br>
<p>This is of course contrary to Ray Kurzweil's &quot;Law of Accelerating
<br>
Returns&quot; model of exponential growth
<br>
(<a href="http://kurzweilai.net/law">http://kurzweilai.net/law</a>), which argues that &quot;the resources underlying
<br>
the exponential growth of an evolutionary process are relatively
<br>
unbounded&quot; and that several forces the impel this growth, such as
<br>
positive feedback loops, the increasing &quot;order&quot; of the information
<br>
embedded, etc.
<br>
<p>3. A reductio ad absurdum argument that the current exponential pattern
<br>
is &quot;so steep that around the year 2025 we would be witnessing the
<br>
equivalent of all of the twentieth-century milestones in less than a
<br>
week, and the rate of appearance of milestones would continue to
<br>
increase. Sometime later, humans will become incapable of perceiving
<br>
changes that take place in fractions of a second. Does it still make
<br>
sense to talk in terms of change when no one preceives it?&quot; The notion
<br>
that human perception (the classic &quot;tree in the forest&quot; argument from
<br>
Bishop Berkeley's idealism) is a prerequisite to reality is questionable
<br>
and Modis offers no support for this argument.
<br>
<p>These arguments raise several interesting questions:
<br>
<p>1. Is his forecasted exponential growth rate accurate, based on an
<br>
extropolation of current growth rates? (This is independent of the
<br>
question of resource limitations.)
<br>
<p>2. Are a priori principles of complexity and rate of growth based on
<br>
historical growth data across various domains (cosmological, geological,
<br>
biological, sociological, and technological) meaningful? 
<br>
<p>3. Exactly what are the future resource limitations we face that would
<br>
cause a stasis in technological growth until 2038, given the promises of
<br>
nanotechnology, quantum computing, AI, etc., and other radical possible
<br>
developments that could lead to accelerated exponential growth? This is
<br>
not explicitly addressed, so the pessimisitic 2038 figure for the next
<br>
complexity jump seems unsupported. It seems to be based on an a priori
<br>
philosophical principle of complexity (&quot;the evolution of complexity in
<br>
the universe has been following a logistic growth pattern from the very
<br>
beginning&quot;), rather than on an analysis of specific resource limitations
<br>
in the future and their possible effects.
<br>
<p>Note: a more technical version of this article is available:
<br>
&quot;Forecasting the Growth of Complexity and Change&quot; 
<br>
(<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/tmodis/TedWEB.htm">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/tmodis/TedWEB.htm</a>).
<br>
<p>I would be very much interested in comments by SL4 list members.
