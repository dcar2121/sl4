<em>&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong, I've read much of the stuff you've

<em>&gt; &gt; written, its clear to me that you are most likely not off your meds.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Great.  Go read &quot;Levels of Organization in General Intelligence&quot;, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you're interested in criticizing any of the specific theory found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, feel free to do so.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not criticizing your work, I'm criticizing your attitude to the
<br>
academic world. Your attitude screams crackpot. And given how hard it is
<br>
to get any serious attention in the AI field (or whichever field you
<br>
decide is the correct audience for your particular take on AI), you should
<br>
try very hard to avoid that. (and it just irritates me.)
<br>
<p>For any research project to be science, and not pseudo-science you require
<br>
3 things:
<br>
<p>1) a credible research group, filled or associated with properly
<br>
credential-ed researchers. (why? because without this, nobody will waste
<br>
the time to review your work without good reason, see below).
<br>
<p>2) a credible body of work, that has been suitably reviewed (by a group
<br>
like the one described above).
<br>
<p>3) a credible and logic-ly correct methodology for producing the above
<br>
body of work.
<br>
<p>Why bother with all that? Because real science gets real funding and
<br>
recognition (eventual, but required for large scale funding however),
<br>
pseudo-science hangs around the Internet, waiting for someone to foolish
<br>
read it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Academic fields are sometimes wastelands. Nature has no a priori tendency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce truths that are easy to explain to a lay audience.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure many free energy crackpots consider physics a wasteland because
<br>
their ground breaking ideas are not even mentioned. And you'd be amazed
<br>
how difficult their &quot;truths&quot; are to explain to anyone who does not have
<br>
their collection of logical errors to reason with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Credentials&quot; are not the proper object of a university system, learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is.
</em><br>
<p>Credentials are a token with which one proves he/she has been taught the
<br>
skills to learn, and the background knowledge to at least start an
<br>
understanding in their field. Dismissing credentials is a common
<br>
sign of a crackpot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The &quot;journals of an entire wing of academia&quot; may easily be the wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audience for any given piece of work.  And it is not very hard to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian than most people.
</em><br>
<p>In many cases &quot;researchers&quot; who are self-described geniuses (or perhaps
<br>
just more X than most people), dismiss journals because their &quot;peers&quot; that
<br>
do the reviewing toss their papers (or use them for lining bird
<br>
cages/cleaning up coffee spills). Usually this is followed by the author
<br>
stalking legitimate researchers to get their ideas heard. This step is
<br>
generally followed by a restraining order or meds being administered.
<br>
Sometimes the above is marked with statements like &quot;Academics in this
<br>
field are filled with anti-knowledge!&quot;, or &quot;Those reviewers aren't smart
<br>
enough to understand my paper!&quot;, or even &quot;There is a conspiracy against
<br>
me, my ideas are just too good, and are being suppressed&quot;.
<br>
<p>My 2 cents.
