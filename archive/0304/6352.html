<p><em>&gt; In special relativity, I view myself as still always. I see the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy as moving. Since I see him as moving, I view him as having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinetic energy. (I must admit I'm not entirely clear on the notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measuring space without reference to objects within the space...)
</em><br>
<p>In your frame of reference, he *does* have kinetic energy.  This is
<br>
sort of compensated for by the fact that physical processes take
<br>
more time to complete than they would if they weren't moving relative
<br>
to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, this is why in special relativity, if I have two objects that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have time bombs on them that will blow them up after ten seconds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (relative to the local frame of reference), and we send one of them at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high speed past the other, the observer on each of the objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceives himself as still, and therefore sees time as dilated for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other guy, so both think the other blows up first.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, each &quot;thinks&quot; that the other blows up *after* his.  Bertrand
<br>
Russell used to say that one problem with special relativity was that
<br>
the other man's cigar appeared to last longer than one's own.  I put
<br>
&quot;thinks&quot; in quotation marks, because sometimes people suppose that there
<br>
is some sort of error involved, or that it's subjective.  No, the
<br>
processes really do slow down, there is no &quot;thinks&quot; about it, nor
<br>
is there anything subjective about it.  There are just different
<br>
frames of reference, which isn't really the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, but I was under the impression that the average geometry of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanding universe we're in is flat...
</em><br>
<p>I wish I knew.  But I'm all for it!  ;-)

<p>Eliezer writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under General Relativity spacetime is not flat; it can be curved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, in fact, can be expanding. [Right]  Imagine a balloon covered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in raisins.  As you blow up the  balloon, the raisins get farther
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apart; this is inflation. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is really known as the expansion of the universe.  The
<br>
term *inflation* is usually reserved for a peculiar era early in
<br>
the history of the universe when expansion was unbelievably rapid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The local speed of any raisin can never exceed c, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also possible that if two  raisins start out 186,000 miles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apart and motionless relative to each other, a ray of light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting from one raisin to the other will not have reached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the second raisin one second later because of the expansion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of space in the meanwhile.  If you pick two sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distant points on the balloon, it may be that even if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two raisins are motionless relative to each other, a ray
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of light from one can never reach the other because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balloon is inflating too fast.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly correct.  But the phrasing raises a new question
<br>
for me.  Are we simply forbidden to ask what is the relative
<br>
velocity independent of expansion of two remote objects?  I mean,
<br>
is there some subtle sense in which the question is not supposed
<br>
to make sense?
<br>
<p>The best guess I have goes like this.  Claim:  you can measure
<br>
(approximately) your velocity with respect to the big bang.
<br>
You just average out the frequencies in the various directions
<br>
of the Cosmic Background radiation.  Then you might be able to
<br>
assert that you are at rest with respect to the big bang.  Then
<br>
suppose that the other party over the horizon (i.e. light can
<br>
never reach you from him unless the universe starts to contract) 
<br>
is also at rest relative to the big bang, but the space is
<br>
expanding between you and him at so many light-years per second.
<br>
Then he is also at rest relative to you (except for expansion).
<br>
Then is there a combined, unified frame of reference so that
<br>
your clock and his run at the same rate!?  That is, is there
<br>
Special Relativity at a distance?
