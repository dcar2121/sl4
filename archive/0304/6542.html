<p><em>&gt; Simon [wrote]

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Advanced SI beings may desire &quot;ignorance holidays&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the same way that many adult human beings desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; re-live their childhood -- perhaps to regain their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innocence, or to repeat the losing of their innocence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or simply to enjoy a different level of fun.
</em><br>
<p>But advanced SIs *determine* their desires.  They 
<br>
will implement such a desire only if it fits in
<br>
with their overall value system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Epistemologically speaking, I have often wondered if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my entire life is my future SI-self re-living or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living out fictional/factional variations of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earlier life.
</em><br>
<p>An epistemological problem that hasn't been often
<br>
stressed IMO is the ambiguity of the pointer &quot;this&quot;.
<br>
That is, when one speaks of *this life, *this experience,
<br>
or *this consciousness, we're used to knowing what
<br>
that means, and that it means one thing unambiguously.
<br>
But it's not unambiguous.
<br>
<p>So I would say that there may be no important difference
<br>
between you experiencing your original first run on Earth
<br>
and your later re-experiencing of it.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;fictional variations&quot;, we are assured by the 
<br>
MWI (and now by the infinite level-one universe) that
<br>
there is no such thing.  Everything happens, and so
<br>
there is no such thing as fiction (as several people
<br>
have pointed out).  So, again, &quot;*this&quot; points to all
<br>
the copies in all the universes who experience your
<br>
life.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can never turn the subjective probability of a Hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scenario happening to any given being into a zero.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which means that somewhere out there are perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innocent beings going through absolute Hells, much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worse than Dante could have ever envisaged, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is happening in a very real sense (there's even an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infinite ensemble of copies of you which will fall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into a Hell scenario in the next 10 seconds).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the opposite can also be said.  Every single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of these hellish state-spaces will immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jump into an extremely large number of extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive, possibly apotheosis states lasting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indefinitely.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  As I said in an earlier post, the only reason that
<br>
this doesn't seem to occur to us with quite the force
<br>
that the hell-branches do, is that we happen to know of
<br>
lots of ways to make contemporary people miserable, but
<br>
don't know very many ways to pleasure them.
