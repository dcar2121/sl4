Singularity Summit 2010 returns to San Francisco, explores
<br>
intelligence augmentation
<br>
Speakers include Futurist Ray Kurzweil, Magician-Skeptic James Randi
<br>
<p>Will it be one day become possible to boost human intelligence using
<br>
brain implants, or create an artificial intelligence smarter than
<br>
Einstein? In a 1993 paper presented to NASA, science fiction author
<br>
and mathematician Vernor Vinge called such a hypothetical event a
<br>
“Singularity”, saying “From the human point of view this change will
<br>
be a throwing away of all the previous rules, perhaps in the blink of
<br>
an eye”. Vinge pointed out that intelligence enhancement could lead to
<br>
“closing the loop” between intelligence and technology, creating a
<br>
positive feedback effect.
<br>
<p>This August 14-15, hundreds of AI researchers, robotics experts,
<br>
philosophers, entrepreneurs, scientists, and interested laypeople will
<br>
converge in San Francisco to address the Singularity and related
<br>
issues at the only conference on the topic, the Singularity Summit.
<br>
Experts in fields including animal intelligence, artificial
<br>
intelligence, brain-computer interfacing, tissue regeneration, medical
<br>
ethics, computational neurobiology, augmented reality, and more will
<br>
share their latest research and explore its implications for the
<br>
future of humanity.
<br>
<p>“This year, the conference shifts to a focus on neuroscience,
<br>
bioscience, cognitive enhancement, and other explorations of what
<br>
Vernor Vinge called ‘intelligence amplification’ — the other route to
<br>
the Singularity,” said Michael Vassar, president of the Singularity
<br>
Institute, which is hosting the event.
<br>
<p>Irene Pepperberg, author of “Alex &amp; Me,” who has pushed the frontier
<br>
of animal intelligence with her research on African Gray Parrots, will
<br>
explore the ethical and practical implications of non-human
<br>
intelligence enhancement and of the creation of new intelligent life
<br>
less powerful than ourselves. Futurist-inventor Ray Kurzweil will
<br>
discuss reverse-engineering the brain and his forthcoming book, How
<br>
the Mind Works and How to Build One. Allan Synder, Director, Centre
<br>
for the Mind at the University of Sydney, will explore the use of
<br>
transcranial magnetic stimulation for the enhancement of narrow
<br>
cognitive abilities. Joe Tsien will talk about the smarter rats and
<br>
mice that he created by tuning the molecular substrate of the brain’s
<br>
learning mechanism. Steve Mann, “the world’s first cyborg,” will
<br>
demonstrate his latest geek-chic inventions: wearable computers now
<br>
used by almost 100,000 people.
<br>
<p>Other speakers will include magician-skeptic and MacArthur Genius
<br>
Award winner James Randi; Gregory Stock (Redesigning Humans), former
<br>
Director of the Program on Medicine, Technology, and Society at UCLA’s
<br>
School of Public Health; Terry Sejnowski, Professor and Laboratory
<br>
Head, Salk Institute Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, who
<br>
believes we are just ten years away from being able to upload
<br>
ourselves; Ellen Heber-Katz, Professor, Molecular and Cellular
<br>
Oncogenesis Program at The Wistar Institute, who is investigating the
<br>
molecular basis of wound regeneration in mutant mice, which can
<br>
regenerate limbs, hearts, and spinal cords; Anita Goel, MD, physicist,
<br>
and CEO of nanotechnology company Nanobiosym; and David Hanson,
<br>
Founder &amp; CEO, Hanson Robotics, who is creating the world’s most
<br>
realistic humanoid robots.
