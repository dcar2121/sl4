<br>
 
<br>
<a href="http://MouseSearch3d.com">http://MouseSearch3d.com</a>
<br>
 
<br>
I started with 1.3 million Wikipedia pages, chosen by not having any numbers in
<br>
the name and short names.
<br>
 
<br>
Then I used the following algorithm to reduce those to around 10000 pages:
<br>
 
<br>
Each iteration, count how many incoming links and outgoing links are left, and
<br>
keep only the pages that have more incoming links than outgoing links and have
<br>
at least 5 of each.
<br>
 
<br>
It generates a very high quality and well spread out and well connected set of
<br>
pages.
<br>
 
<br>
I wrote Javascript code to use it as a simulated brain. I wouldn't call it a
<br>
neural-network because it has continuous neural-activation (calculated a few
<br>
times per second), and a node only changes its own neural activation (based on
<br>
its forward and reverse links' neural activation).
<br>
 
<br>
Exclude reverse links that are also forward links, and forward links that are
<br>
also reverse links.
<br>
 
<br>
Similarly to how I narrowed down the 1.3 million pages, for each node, if the
<br>
sum of the reverse links neural activation is more than the sum of the forward
<br>
links neural activation, then decay that node's neural activation toward 3, else
<br>
decay toward -3.
<br>
 
<br>
A few times per second, normalize all neural activation levels on a bell curve,
<br>
average 0, standard deviation 1.
<br>
 
<br>
Increase neural activation when mouse touches a word on screen or gets closer or
<br>
stays close longer. Make the word flash and decay slowly.
<br>
 
<br>
Remove words with neural activation too close to 0, and add some more words
<br>
(with forward and reverse links) loaded from the internet (of those 10000).
<br>
 
<br>
Process words with very high or very low neural activation more often.
<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
For now, the 3d part is just so you can move the words around and touch only the
<br>
words you want to touch with the mouse. It includes evolution of AffineTransform
<br>
matrixes, but the fitness function is arbitrary, just something to make it move
<br>
in interesting ways for now. Its a 6x6 matrix of x y z red green blue, and 1
<br>
offset matrix size 6.
<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
Its simple algorithms, but it beats the other 3d search-engines that are being
<br>
created. They're building on the assumption that it should display the results
<br>
from their existing system. I built <a href="http://MouseSearch3d.com">http://MouseSearch3d.com</a> specificly for 3d
<br>
mouse interaction, as you can see in the history at
<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlangmouse">http://sourceforge.net/projects/natlangmouse</a>
<br>
 
<br>
 
<br>
I started it as more complex code in my server, but the simple code written
<br>
above works better, so I uploaded a version that is only 1 html and
<br>
approximately 10000 text files. Why? So the people who only know Javascript can
<br>
learn AI, so it might spread to thousands of people, kind of like Mentifex's
<br>
MindForth is in an HTML file for. Almost all softwares are too complex for the
<br>
complexity of the problems they solve. Maybe if people see that small and simple
<br>
code can do complex things, they will stop buildingo n their huge ancient
<br>
infrastructure that has more problems than it solves. Most of the jobs it
<br>
appears I could get are doing the same old mindless work. That's what our
<br>
society has become. They don't know why they do it anymore. They just know it
<br>
pays the best.
<br>

Please try <a href="http://MouseSearch3d.com">http://MouseSearch3d.com</a> and tell me what you think of the
<br>
user-interface and the way it has conversations with you (with moving words
<br>
appearing and disappearing).
