<p>
Recent list discussion has inspired me to formalize a train of thought 
<br>
that has taken shape over several years.
<br>
<p>For anyone interested, the book in development can be found online at 
<br>
the following URL, where it is possible to attach comments and criticisms:
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;From the draft introduction:
<br>
<p>This book presents a view of our place in the universe and where we may 
<br>
be going with it.
<br>
<p>A thread we will see running through all of this is that from our 
<br>
position in the overall scheme of things, some of our experience makes 
<br>
sense only from a subjective point of view, and some requires adoption 
<br>
of an objective point of view. In either case, we are not fully 
<br>
subjective or objective, and this comes down to the fact that &quot;we&quot; don't 
<br>
actually exist as popularly conceived.
<br>
<p>We will explore the idea that there appears to be one encompassing 
<br>
reality, within which all the pieces fit, but from our necessarily 
<br>
subjective and limited point of view, apparent contradiction and paradox 
<br>
are inevitable.
<br>
<p>We'll take a look at what appears to be a universal &quot;ratchet effect&quot;, 
<br>
that the universe tends to produce systems with increasing complexity, 
<br>
based on natural selection of what works.
<br>
<p>We'll look at morality, essentially how we determine right and wrong, 
<br>
and suggest that as physical systems within the physical universe, we 
<br>
are inextricably part of the universal process that favors systems that 
<br>
work. Within any subjective context, &quot;good&quot; is what works and leads to 
<br>
growth.
<br>
<p>We'll broaden our understanding of subjective/objective points of view 
<br>
to see that these can be seen more generally as nested scopes of 
<br>
context, and that as the context increases it becomes a more accurate 
<br>
model of reality, and thus a better approximation of what works and is 
<br>
thus considered good.
<br>
<p>Extrapolating from the foregoing, we speculate on the prospect of a 
<br>
rational framework for moral decision making in the absence of complete 
<br>
information, based on general principles of &quot;what works&quot; at all scales 
<br>
of organization, including scales beyond our own capability to comprehend.
