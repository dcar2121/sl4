It's appropriate and opportune that you bring up the question of free
<br>
will.  A set of philosophical topics - the nature of self, free will,
<br>
and morality -  are inextricably intertwined, fraught with contradiction
<br>
and ultimately paradox, endlessly debated - and resolvable by
<br>
understanding the nested scopes of context within which these issues are
<br>
seen.  Contradiction and paradox are always the result of insufficient
<br>
scope, because in the bigger picture, all the pieces do fit.
<br>
<p>You think I'm oversimplifying morality, while I am saying that from a
<br>
more encompassing point of view, it is indeed simpler, and in a way that
<br>
lends itself to improved practices in very concrete ways.  I think we're
<br>
moving toward this, not in a directed manner, but as the natural outcome
<br>
of repeated selection of what works.
<br>
<p>Likewise with free will.  Again, the contradictions and paradox arise
<br>
due to limitations in the context of awareness from which the issue is
<br>
seen, compounded by our evolved preference for the first person
<br>
perspective.  Most of us can adopt a third person point of view at
<br>
times, and reason with an approximation of objectivity about how things
<br>
appear to work, but then when it's time for us to evaluate our &quot;true&quot;
<br>
belief in these concepts we pop back into subjective first person
<br>
viewpoint (because we evolved to &quot;know&quot; this is our only &quot;true&quot;
<br>
viewpoint, from the location of the &quot;self&quot;) and we find that objective
<br>
conceptions of self, consciousness, free-will, intentionality, morality,
<br>
and the like, feel clearly and obviously wrong. (All value is subjective.)
<br>
<p>More specifically to your comment on free will:  In fact, increasing
<br>
knowledge of causes enhances, rather than diminishes, free will.
<br>
Consider the freedoms we enjoy today in virtually every area of our
<br>
lives.  We can choose from a much wider range of options, and take
<br>
action on these choices, to an extent never experienced by our
<br>
ancestors. We can choose and take corresponding action with regard to
<br>
the temperature of our surroundings, travel around the globe, communicate
<br>
with almost anyone, learn from others, select from a wide range of food
<br>
and entertainment, and on and on.  These freedoms are essentially due to
<br>
our increased understanding of how things work, and if things didn't
<br>
work in a fully determined way, then our ability to predict, make
<br>
choices, and control would be severely reduced.
<br>
<p>The apparent contradictions in the intertwined concepts of self,
<br>
consciousness, free will, and morality, are all related to reasoning
<br>
within insufficient context.
