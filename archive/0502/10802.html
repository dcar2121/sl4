</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argue that progress, at all scales, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Am I understanding you correctly?  If we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on this point of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; departure, then I would be very interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exploring further.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - Jef
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a school of thought that would argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notably Thomas Kuhn (/The Structure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Revolutions, 1966 or so).  But I agree with you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that human society tends toward more objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the world around them with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altho with occasional setbacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where you are losing me is in connecting that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with morality.  I can imagine some examples in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a better understanding can lead to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - If we understand how charging interest for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develops an economy, we will not call charging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest immoral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - If it turns out that homosexuality is largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically or environmentally determined,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a free choice, people may accept it more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I don't know that this always plays out so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neatly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The more we understand about human behavior,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more we can trace it to causes, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible people seem to be for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Complete understanding may simply explode even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the notion of morality.  For example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Child molesters were in most cases molested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or abused themselves as children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Stepparents are more likely to abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stepchildren
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than natural parents are to abuse natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this makes genetic sense for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - It makes more evolutionary sense for men than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women to be promiscuous; at the same time, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more sense for men than for women not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promiscuity in their mate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does understanding the cause of &quot;immoral&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it more acceptable?  More moral?  Or does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just leave us unable to figure out what &quot;moral&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means?
</em><br>
<p>This is why I prefer 'ethical'. You pose these
<br>
questions as if they were difficult. They are
<br>
not, when properly posed. Simply ask, 'What is
<br>
ethical in this case?&quot; Abuse/molestation
<br>
represent abuses of power, coercion, etc. These
<br>
are unethical. Knowing there is an historical or
<br>
evolutionary reason does not excuse unethical
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p>'Promiscuity' is a different case, prejudged by
<br>
the use of a word with negative connotations.
<br>
Bonobos, our closest primate relatives, are very
<br>
promiscuous within their bands, and with them sex
<br>
is a social lubricant, damping down competition
<br>
and violence. The males have large testicles, and
<br>
the competition occurs between sperm cells, not
<br>
males. They can get away with this because their
<br>
small 'tribes' are not big enough to create much
<br>
risk of STD's evolving to take advantage of all
<br>
the unsafe sex. Male and female bonobos are about
<br>
the same size and neither sex is dominant. Humans
<br>
are not bonobos, but we're not walruses or
<br>
kangaroos either (tournament species where one
<br>
large bull owns all the smaller cows until a
<br>
challenger can beat him almost to death).
<br>
Scientists have discovered a division of labor in
<br>
human spermatozoa; some of them clump to block
<br>
sperm from other males. The design of the human
<br>
penis, along with the fact that human intercourse
<br>
lasts more than thirty seconds, indicates that we
<br>
have evolved a coital style to break up these
<br>
clumps which may have been deposited previously
<br>
by another male. Upshot: monogamy is unnatural in
<br>
humans. We have monogamy because of historical
<br>
reasons having to do with property, inheritance,
<br>
and so on.
<br>
Promiscuity is therefore not 'immoral' in a
<br>
society where it is traditionally accepted. As I
<br>
pointed out to a friend, the whole sexual guilt
<br>
issue does not mean sex causes guilt, but rather
<br>
that you were trained to feel guilt.
<br>
Where males enforce a double standard against
<br>
women, evolutionary strategy is only part of the
<br>
reason. Human societies are capable of expressing
<br>
a wide range of positions between bonobo-type
<br>
equality/promiscuity (such as some American
<br>
Indian tribes before the European conquest, or
<br>
Amsterdam for that matter) to walrus-type
<br>
violence and jealousy (welcome to Afghanistan!)
<br>
<p>I feel confident that I could make a solid
<br>
logical case that for humans, 'Amsterdam' is far
<br>
more ethical than 'Afghanistan'. However, I also
<br>
know that most people would not be able to follow
<br>
the logic, much less willing. They would even
<br>
assert that my 'ethical logic' is 'immoral'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, post-singularity, the human species may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapidly diverge into a large number of species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that it is no longer feasible to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral relations between them.  So increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge may make the subjectivity of morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just thinking aloud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; '
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Phil
</em><br>
I think it may have been E.O. Wilson who made the
<br>
point that, in the mists of prehistory, the rule
<br>
was that if you met a stranger, one not from your
<br>
own tribe of forty or sixty related people, you
<br>
killed him. It was the safe thing to do.
<br>
Otherwise he might report your presence to his
<br>
tribe and they might kill you. Over time the
<br>
circle of people-you-don't-kill expanded to
<br>
include villages, city-states, kingdoms. We have
<br>
arrived at the point where, on paper at least, we
<br>
are not supposed to kill anybody on the planet
<br>
except under certain legal circumstances. Even
<br>
the killing of wild animals has begun to be
<br>
proscribed in some cases. So what if the human
<br>
species bifurcates? Sentient beings have
<br>
inalienable rights. If you wish to suggest that
<br>
it could become &quot;no longer feasible to maintain
<br>
moral relations between them&quot; I think you would
<br>
be under the obligation to explain how, or why
<br>
that could happen. The ethical approach would be
<br>
to widen the circle again, to include all
<br>
sentient beings, and expect them to behave
<br>
ethically also. It's the social contract, baby,
<br>
yeaaah!
