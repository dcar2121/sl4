<em>&gt; &quot;proportion the strength of convictions to the strength of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence&quot; is easy for me to say, but not so easy to put into practice
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Indeed, the only way to get through each day is to
<br>
memoize the old decisions for any input which is
<br>
similar, except when there's extra time and energy
<br>
to explore the solution again.  However, this only
<br>
works for decisions that are &quot;really&quot; the same
<br>
decision, and not those that are very different but
<br>
seem similar on the surface.
<br>
<p>For the kinds of problems that Eliezer is tackling,
<br>
however, there appear (from this outsider's view)
<br>
to be many decisions which look similar to those not
<br>
directly in the field, but which are not similar
<br>
enough to have old results apply usefully.
<br>
<p>Such a strategy that works for most applications,
<br>
then, isn't so useful when doing something that is
<br>
probably truly new.
