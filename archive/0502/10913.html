<p>
Looking back over some of my old posts all I can say
<br>
is: Oh shit! 
<br>
<p>Why oh why couldn't I keep my big mouth shut? :-( 
<br>
When I first came to SL4 I was firing off wild
<br>
opinions and guesses all over the place.  Then I
<br>
entered  a 'silliness' phase, where I imagined I could
<br>
program the FAI myself on a ZX Spectrum in a few
<br>
hundred lines.  Oh dear.  I think everyone passes
<br>
through a phase where they imagine that they can code
<br>
the FAI themselves in a week.  But still.  I had an
<br>
acute case of grandiosity. I'd better apologize for
<br>
all these silly posts.
<br>
<p>Now I'm worried, because I realize that post-human
<br>
historians will probably be checking the SL4 archives.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shit man :-(
<br>
<p>After much early gibberish I have finally managed to
<br>
come up with the outlines of some ideas for FAI that
<br>
do at least make sense.  I summarized some of these
<br>
ideas coherently in my short essay here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://transhumanism.org/index.php/th/more/692/">http://transhumanism.org/index.php/th/more/692/</a>
<br>
<p>On the basis of my ideas I also made 10 falsifiable
<br>
predictions (which are 'informed guesses' based on my
<br>
ideas) here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0501/10623.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0501/10623.html</a>
<br>
<p>I'd better get some of those right man, or I'm gonna
<br>
go down as a real arse.  I've *got* to be right about
<br>
at least half of those predictions dammit!
<br>
<p>My 'bottom line' idea is of course Universal Morality.
<br>
&nbsp;I simply do not believe that evolution was purely
<br>
based on natural selection alone.  Nor do I believe
<br>
that the purpose of the human mind was simply to make
<br>
babies (achieving reproductive fitness).  Frankly, I
<br>
do not understand how people imagine they could create
<br>
an SAI at all, based on these assumptions about the
<br>
human mind. 
<br>
<p>My bottom line, of course, is the existence of some
<br>
sort of spectacular self-similarly properties running
<br>
through reality at all levels of organization.  So the
<br>
science of complex systems is where all my bets are
<br>
placed.  So for instance, I think that 'order for
<br>
free' (aka Kauffman) got slipped into evolution direct
<br>
from the laws of physics and this order is somehow
<br>
reflected in the human mind.  So although I agree that
<br>
it's certainly true that parts of the human mind are
<br>
the way they are because that was the best way to make
<br>
babies, I think that evolutionary psychology is
<br>
actually a red herring and the science of complex
<br>
systems is where the *real* understanding of minds in
<br>
general lies.  
<br>
<p>My idea is that if I'm right, this would greatly cut
<br>
down the complexity of the seed FAI code.  We need
<br>
only find the big self-similarity properties and then
<br>
we can 'slay' multiple levels of organization in one
<br>
go.  The idea is that all the different levels of
<br>
abstraction that appear to be neccessery for general
<br>
intelligence, all those different models etc all that
<br>
complication can be 'whalloped' in one go with just a
<br>
few big 'fractal' (self-similarity properties).
<br>
<p>Any way, that's my 'bottom line' idea.  But I think
<br>
I'll definitely keep my mouth sut about FAI from now
<br>
on.
