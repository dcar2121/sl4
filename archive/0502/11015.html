Hi,
<br>
<p>Having absorbed a bunch of commentary on my ITSSIM and GoalGeneralization
<br>
draft papers, here are my current thoughts.  Part of this is summary, but
<br>
there are some new ideas at the end.
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
I continue to think ITSSIM is a valid method for providing a reasonable
<br>
degree of assurance that an AI will continue to be careful as it
<br>
self-modifies and self-improves.  Of course, there are no guarantees with
<br>
such things, as proved by the possibility that when an AI gets smarter than
<br>
some particular value, superintelligent aliens will contact it and modify
<br>
it.  An interesting question to explore is how stable ITSSIM is if hardware
<br>
errors or the like occur; I think the answer will be &quot;quite stable.&quot;
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
I also think that it makes sense to impose a criterion of &quot;Careful Supergoal
<br>
Generalization&quot; (which I now see is a better name than Goal Generalization).
<br>
The issue here is, if an AI has an overarching supergoal, and then modifies
<br>
itself to as to change its supergoal, what restrictions can we make as to
<br>
how the new supergoal relates to the prior supergoal?  My suggestion is that
<br>
one could (and perhaps should) intentionally restrict this relationship to
<br>
one of &quot;careful generalization&quot;, in a certain sense.  My definition of
<br>
generalization in this context seems sound but may end up needing some
<br>
refinement.
<br>
<p>3)
<br>
These two ideas can be combined naturally, if one assumes that the initial
<br>
supergoal includes ITSSIM.  I didn't quite say this in either of the papers
<br>
but I now think this is a good way to phrase things.
<br>
<p>4)
<br>
I now agree with several commentators that the inclusion of explicit
<br>
&quot;emergency measures&quot;, as I suggested in the Goal Generalization essay, is a
<br>
bad hack.  Rather, I think it's better to use either
<br>
a) pure ITSSIM, or
<br>
b) careful supergoal generalization, with an initial supergoal that includes
<br>
ITSSIM, and also includes emergency measures covering all known existential
<br>
risks
<br>
<p>In case b, we are counting on the AI to generalize ITSSIM as seems
<br>
appropriate, and also to carefully generalize its initial emergency measures
<br>
as seems appropriate.
<br>
<p>5)
<br>
After reading Pei Wang's commentary, I see that the use of &quot;theorem proving&quot;
<br>
in the context of proving theorems about empirical reality needs more
<br>
elaboration.  Specifically, it needs to be emphasized that the axioms of
<br>
one's formal system must include an assumptive solution to the Humean
<br>
&quot;problem of induction&quot;.  This is implicit in Schmidhuber's Godel Machine
<br>
work but he doesn't elaborate on the point at all, so far as I can recall.
<br>
<p><p>I will product a new version of the paper (with the best parts of the goal
<br>
generalization paper fused into the ITSSIM paper), when I get a chance,
<br>
probably sometime late next week.
<br>
<p>Further constructive criticism is appreciated.
<br>
<p>I have also put a little thought into how these ideas could be explored
<br>
using current AI technologies, prior to the advent of amazingly powerful
<br>
theorem-provers.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that one could implement preliminary versions of both ITSSIM
<br>
and careful supergoal generalization, by substituting &quot;guessing&quot; for
<br>
&quot;proving&quot; in both algorithms.  Of course this results in rather different
<br>
algorithms -- but the qualitative nature of the dynamics of the evolving AI
<br>
system might not be so different.  At very least it would be an interesting
<br>
sort of experiment.
<br>
<p>This kind of experiment could be done using an only moderately improved
<br>
version of the current Novamente AI codebase.  But of course, the Novamente
<br>
project is in a pretty severe financial situation at this moment, so we have
<br>
no resources to  play with this sort of thing.  Maybe next year ;-p
<br>
