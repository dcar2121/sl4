<em>&gt;&gt; What could you possibly mean by a statement about having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the mental capacity to increase mental capacity?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; idea that one could increase one's intelligence by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; act of will, likewise, seems so obviously wrong that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; seems to indicate that you and others on this list are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not using the term &quot;IQ&quot; to mean the same things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have written a number of IQ tests and an IQ tests your knowledge and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then
</em><br>
<p>My assumption is that you're using the term &quot;written&quot; to
<br>
mean &quot;sat at examination&quot;, rather than &quot;created&quot;, since
<br>
I would have expected you to be clear on standard deviation
<br>
and the like in the latter case.
<br>
<p>[snip anecdote]
<br>
<em>&gt; Your *obviously wrong* comment, I obviously disagree with.
</em><br>
<p>Understandably.  Your anecdote, interesting though it is,
<br>
fails to convince me that you increased your intelligence.
<br>
Rather, I'd expect that you chose to use the processing
<br>
power you had.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  In any case, Phil's question is apparently predicated on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the assumption that there is some technology available
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to perform the narrowing or boosting required, as is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the nature of a thought experiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I responded to emails that I read on the list.  Sometimes the topic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly while the subject title doesn't.  In one of my emails I said 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was responding to his hypothetical case with real world replies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believed those comments were relavent.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, my apologies for singling you out.  It's
<br>
become more common recently for people to seem
<br>
to misunderstand each other on this list, often
<br>
in ways that perpetuate the misunderstanding.
<br>
<p>At least, that's how it looks from here. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; For everyone involved in this argument and others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; recently: Please make an effort to understand what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your opponents are trying to communicate.  Even where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I agree with one side or the other of some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ongoing debates here, it's clear that you all spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much of your time talking past each other rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discussing differences of substance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see you have made posts since August 17, 2000.  Does this mean that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand all arguments and that other *new comers* don't?  Even if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Phil
</em><br>
<p>No.  In fact, I do not spend the time required to
<br>
attempt to understand some of the posters on this
<br>
list, for differing reasons.  However, it has been
<br>
the case that I *do* understand a statement, and
<br>
those replying appear not to understand it.  It's
<br>
only because this appeared to be happening in both
<br>
directions in recent debate that I brought it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; was assuming some method of increasing or decreasing peoples IQ, my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still stand.  Most people (in my experience) don't like or want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart people.  When I discovered this, I was obviously shocked, such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bias of people who value intelligence.  If you gave them the choice to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their IQ 20 points, they would decline it.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  While I agree that if you asked just like
<br>
that, many would decline, I believe this is because
<br>
they would expect (perhaps rightly!) that brighter
<br>
versions of themselves would no longer be interested
<br>
in all the same things -- would, in fact, be another
<br>
person altogether from their current perspectives.
<br>
<p>If, instead, you found out what they like to do that
<br>
they don't do as well as they'd prefer, and ask them
<br>
if they'd like to raise their ability in that area
<br>
by fifty percent or more, I think the answers would
<br>
change.
