<p>&quot;1) Skynet becomes self-aware and eats us&quot;
<br>
<p>|&gt; I am only worried about (1). I can imagine (3) happening, but I
<br>
|&gt; don't object to it. Survival of the fittest is how I got here,
<br>
|&gt; and damned if I'm going to starve to death for the sake of some
<br>
|&gt; rats. I think it's fair enough to apply the same standard to
<br>
|&gt; something smarter and higher on the food chain.
<br>
|
<br>
|
<br>
| I used to think that too, until I thought about it a bit more
<br>
| clearly and realized that the end point of evolution would not be
<br>
| sentient.
<br>
<p>:s/would/might/g
<br>
<p>If the end point of evolutions is not sentient we are screwed, if it
<br>
is sentient we are safe, subject on both sides to the vaguaries of
<br>
horizon problems. This is a truism if you believe that all
<br>
evolutionary paths are eventually explored. Evolution is not a
<br>
circumventable process, we can only do our best to build a fittest
<br>
organism which is interesting rather than not.
<br>
<p>| Let survival of the fittest run to its ultimate conclusion and
<br>
| you'll have something that might be considered intelligent - at
<br>
| least, it'll be better than any human at solving some types of
<br>
| engineering problems, for example - but there will be nothing it
<br>
| will be like to be that thing. There'll be a universe full of
<br>
| marvellously intricate, optimally self-replicating nanomachinery -
<br>
| and nobody there to make use of it.
<br>
|
<br>
| Still happy with that?
<br>
<p>I don't accept that there is a &gt;5% probability of it being true that
<br>
nanomachines are the end point of evolution. My actual estimate would
<br>
be far less, closer to .05%. Just to pick numbers intuitively, of
<br>
course, yet informed by available information.
<br>
<p>|&gt; * We should realise that evolution can be made to work for us by
<br>
|&gt; building an AGI ecosystem, and thus forcing the AGI to survive
<br>
|&gt; only by working for the common interest
<br>
|
<br>
| And the above is why doing things on this basis turns out to be
<br>
| such a horribly bad idea.
<br>
<p>1) Humans are social organisms and have competed on a group basis
<br>
2) Therefore morality
<br>
<p>Corrolory: linking the survival of an organism to moral behaviour is
<br>
the best way to ensure the continued presence of morality in future
<br>
generations of that species.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
