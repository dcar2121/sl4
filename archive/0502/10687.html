<p><p>Well, 2200 years ago. :)  The Khmer Rouge of their day, but more persistent.
<br>
<p>This is perhaps off-topic, but does resonate curiously with the dread one 
<br>
feels toward certain kinds of AI proposals. See, e.g.:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.loyno.edu/~seduffy/chinhan.html">http://www.loyno.edu/~seduffy/chinhan.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; Operating on Legalist principles, Ch'in government concentrated on 
<br>
strengthening the power of the military and the control of the central 
<br>
government. Under the control of its emperor, the Ch'in regime instituted 
<br>
bureaucratic reforms, and enforced uniformity of thought by attempting to 
<br>
eradicate all other philosophical teachers and writings. The Great Wall was 
<br>
begun under the Ch'in Regime...
<br>
<p>Legalism, the philosophy and intellectual foundation of the Ch'in state, 
<br>
gained a brief but powerful period of philosophical dominance in China 
<br>
under the Ch'in. Legalists might today be called &quot;realists&quot;; they argued 
<br>
that the answers to society's problems couldn't be found in the past 
<br>
because human society always changing, a radical concept for the times. 
<br>
Legalists wanted a rationally organized, centralized state with a strong 
<br>
impersonal government. They saw human nature as naturally lazy and selfish, 
<br>
and men as naturally reluctant to work for the common good or engage in 
<br>
warfare. A ruler needed absolute authority to control the populace through 
<br>
strict enforcement of stringent laws. Administrators should be promoted on 
<br>
basis of merit, not birth, and no one should be above the law. Those who 
<br>
contributed to state should be rewarded, and those who did not should be 
<br>
punished harshly as examples. Legalism believed there were only two types 
<br>
of useful citizens, farmers and soldiers. All others ­ merchants, artisans, 
<br>
philosophers, innkeepers, aristocrats, historians ­ destabilized society by 
<br>
encouraging personal avarice, making the people question authority, or 
<br>
causing discontent. Legalists saw Taoism as a threat because it made 
<br>
citizens lazy and inward-looking, and Confucianism as a threat because it 
<br>
taught that primary loyalty was to the family and personal relationships, 
<br>
which could interfere with people's loyalty to the state. Legalism opposed 
<br>
formal education except in practical fields such as medicine and 
<br>
agriculture; it especially opposed history and philosophy, which taught 
<br>
people to think independently and question authority.
<br>
<p>The Ch'in state's harsh laws and the quick speed of changes caused the 
<br>
entire system to collapse, and rebellion spread as the Ch'in lost popular 
<br>
support. Despite their real accomplishments, the First Emperor has been 
<br>
universally reviled in Chinese memory; and popular folk tales denounce his 
<br>
cruelty and tyranny. Millions died after being conscripted for his wars, 
<br>
wall-building, and tomb-building. Many more paid crushing taxes to support 
<br>
the projects. All intellectual discourse was prohibited, and many 
<br>
intellectuals were burned alive for refusing to give up alternate 
<br>
philosophies or for hiding banned books. In 213 [BCE], the government 
<br>
ordered all books other than histories of the House of Ch'in and works on 
<br>
agriculture, medicine and divination to be confiscated and burned, under 
<br>
penalty of death. Scholars appealed and many, especially Confucians spoke 
<br>
out in protest, and 460 were arrested and executed. The book burnings 
<br>
destroyed forever many of the ancient texts and created gaping holes in our 
<br>
knowledge of pre-Ch'in China. &gt;
