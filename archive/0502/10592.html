</em><br>

<p>Phil, it appears we mostly agree on our observations, but our thinking 
<br>
has not yet converged on what may be implied for the future of moral 
<br>
thinking and behavior.
<br>
<p>A meta-observation:
<br>
It may be interesting and useful to note as a meta-observation that as 
<br>
you and I continue exploration of this topic, I expect our thinking to 
<br>
tend to converge toward a more accurate model of moral issues, for 
<br>
exactly the same reason that I expect local variations on moral 
<br>
standards to converge over time toward a more objectively accurate model 
<br>
of what works and is therefore considered good.
<br>
<p>Another (relevant, I think) meta-observation:
<br>
As I read your examples above, I experienced a familiar sensation of 
<br>
moving in and out of another's conceptual framework.  Within my model of 
<br>
the framework you present, your examples and questions cohere, but then 
<br>
I &quot;widen back&quot; to encompass also my view, and I perceive, not wrongness, 
<br>
but incompleteness in the original sub-context.
<br>
<p>For each example you provided, I watched as my initial reaction was 
<br>
&quot;that's not a moral issue, but rather a situation that can be evaluated 
<br>
in terms of its consequences and managed&quot;, and then I would zoom in a 
<br>
little closer and see &quot;oh, yes that is covered by moral standards within 
<br>
some groups.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, referring back to my earlier description of &quot;what morality is&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;what morality is becoming&quot;, I think the key difference here is that you 
<br>
are referring to moral issues within the more common, conventional 
<br>
framework of moral standards held, but not questioned, by a community, 
<br>
and I am referring to morality in a more abstract sense of making 
<br>
choices of right and wrong, with awareness that they are local and 
<br>
approximate, but based on principles that apply at any scale and can be 
<br>
increasingly agreed upon with increasing scale of context (awareness.)
<br>
<p>I'll try to provide some more specific comments on your examples below.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I can imagine some examples in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a better understanding can lead to more objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- If we understand how charging interest for loans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;develops an economy, we will not call charging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interest immoral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This one's difficult for me, since I see nothing wrong in general with 
<br>
one person offering and another person accepting a loan with interest 
<br>
terms.  However, I am aware of loan-sharking, imposing usurious terms by 
<br>
taking advantage of the desperate situation of another and I do consider 
<br>
that to be immoral behavior.
<br>
Why?  It is not effective cooperation, because it harms the Other, and 
<br>
thus diminishes future opportunities for Self.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- If it turns out that homosexuality is largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetically or environmentally determined, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than a free choice, people may accept it more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I can understand this as a moral issue if I place myself in the 
<br>
unquestioning evolved mindset of the conventional morality mentioned 
<br>
earlier.  From the mindset that I propose and hold, homosexuality and 
<br>
its causes are not a moral issue per se.  However the bias some people 
<br>
hold against homosexuals can certainly be considered immoral since it 
<br>
reduces cooperation by diminishing the Other and unreasonably rejecting 
<br>
a source of diversity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;But I don't know that this always plays out so neatly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The more we understand about human behavior,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the more we can trace it to causes, and the less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;responsible people seem to be for their behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Complete understanding may simply explode even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the notion of morality.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that the cause of an action has any bearing on whether or 
<br>
not it's moral.  I do think understanding causes is useful when devising 
<br>
a response or corrective action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For example
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- Child molesters were in most cases molested
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or abused themselves as children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Molesting children is immoral because it is anticooperative and damaging 
<br>
to Other.  The cause is irrelevant to the morality, but relevant to any 
<br>
possible corrective action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;- Stepparents are more likely to abuse stepchildren
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than natural parents are to abuse natural children.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But this makes genetic sense for them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Same comments as for the child molesters example.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;- It makes more evolutionary sense for men than for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;women to be promiscuous; at the same time, it makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more sense for men than for women not to tolerate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;promiscuity in their mate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Promiscuity is immoral to the extent that it diminishes Self or Other.  
<br>
Understanding the evolved basis for this can help guide one in making 
<br>
good choices.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Does understanding the cause of &quot;immoral&quot; behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it more acceptable?  More moral?  Or does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just leave us unable to figure out what &quot;moral&quot; means?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I've stated that the causes of immoral behavior do not affect the 
<br>
rightness or wrongness of the behavior, but may have some bearing on how 
<br>
best to respond to the behavior.
<br>
<p>My thesis is that our understanding of morality is undergoing a 
<br>
maturation involving greater awareness, and that as our awareness 
<br>
continues to increase with time, so will our morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also, post-singularity, the human species may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rapidly diverge into a large number of species
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such that it is no longer feasible to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral relations between them.  So increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge may make the subjectivity of morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think we are moving toward a system of greater appreciation of local 
<br>
diversity, within a framework of shared principles based on increasing 
<br>
knowledge of what works and is therefore considered good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just thinking aloud.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Your thinking is appreciated.
<br>
