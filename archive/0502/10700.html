E.S. Yudkowsky wrote in LOGI: &quot;Intelligence is an evolutionary advantage
<br>
because it enables us to model, predict, and manipulate reality.&quot; 
<br>
&quot;[O]ur intelligence allows us to model social realities consisting of
<br>
other humans, and the ability to predict and manipulate the internal
<br>
reality of the mind&quot;
<br>
<p>These presuppositions about reality are the usual ones. Reality is &quot;out
<br>
there&quot;, and we can try to understand it and then to manipulate it - as if
<br>
it were an adaptable object. But reality exists not just &quot;out there&quot; --
<br>
we Co-Create at least some of our second-order-reality (2OR) -- and much
<br>
of our reality happens &quot;in here&quot;.
<br>
<p>Borrowing definitions from Paul Watzlawick:
<br>
First-Order Reality (1OR) - the topology of matter (whatever that means.)
<br>
Second-Order Reality (2OR) - our perceptions-of and thoughts-about 1OR
<br>
(and 2OR).
<br>
<p>When we talk or write, we describe the surface of our cognitive maps; and
<br>
under the surface, presuppositional structure develops. When people's
<br>
presuppositional structures match; there is something sometimes called
<br>
&quot;rapport&quot; that develops, an experience of being on &quot;common ground&quot;.
<br>
Rapport is a sense of ease of understanding and communication between
<br>
people; and since much of human reality is constructed and negotiated
<br>
between people, it is a valuable source of information and of the
<br>
co-creation of 2OR.
<br>
<p>Backtracking momentarily: A presupposition is an assumption taken for
<br>
granted but not directly expressed in language (or behavior). In the
<br>
sentence &quot;The cat sat on the table.&quot; -- some of the pressuppositions are:
<br>
cats exists, tables exists, cats can sit, tables can support cats, cats
<br>
can sit on tables. A less direct presupposition (perhaps an &quot;implication&quot;
<br>
or even a &quot;co-location&quot;) is that: the table and cat are indoors in a
<br>
domicile. In order to understand language, we have to revive memories and
<br>
structures into some sort of mental workspace. Much of what is revived
<br>
are presuppositions and implications about.
<br>
<p>And so, when the presuppositions of two persons match; then communication
<br>
is facilitated. For example, one person may accidentally revive memory of
<br>
a tiger (a cat), while the other revives the standard housecat -- when
<br>
revived presuppositions differ, misunderstandings develop. When revived
<br>
presuppositions are similar, communication is facilitated; and we often
<br>
call this &quot;rapport&quot;. There is no need to constantly re-check the
<br>
truth-value of the information being communicated, because we have
<br>
concluded that the other person's cognitive map IS our cognitive map; of
<br>
whatever is under discussion. This is CONTACT with another person at the
<br>
level of minds - Contact with the reality between people.
<br>
<p>This leads to what some hypnotists and people in (the other) NLP; call
<br>
pacing and leading. Tell someone several true things that match the other
<br>
person's cogntitive maps (pace); then say something you want them to
<br>
believe (lead). Since their need to re-check information has been damped
<br>
by pacing their presuppositional structures, you have a better chance of
<br>
redirecting and impacting upon their information store, their thought
<br>
process, their beliefs and attitudes. In other words, you can (more
<br>
easily) install presuppositions that will later be revived when the
<br>
associated context comes up for them (by first matching them at a
<br>
presuppositional level). Sometimes the installation or strengtheing of
<br>
presuppositions is called &quot;learning&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, I don't know if an AGI will maintain hypervigilence of the
<br>
truth-value of information from all sources regardless of past value from
<br>
sources. But I do know that AGI will have to interact with humans (or
<br>
transhumans) if humans want it to solve the problems of humans. And we
<br>
will need to communicate what we want done. This will make it necessary
<br>
to co-create a new reality (new concepts) both in the AGI and in the
<br>
humans who interact with it.
<br>
<p>To Summarize: We need &quot;rapport&quot; with any AGI's. Human reality has to be
<br>
communicated and a co-creation of human-to-AGI-to-human reality will have
<br>
to happen. Rapport is built on the (sense of) synchronization of
<br>
cognitive maps, common ground. Humans are mostly unaware of exactly what
<br>
is being synchronized when they communicate and co-create their
<br>
realities. Communication involves negotiation of 2OR.
<br>
<p><p>Hmmmm,
<br>
<p>Dimitry
