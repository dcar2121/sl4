<p><p>| Hal Finney is the only person I know of who would advocate that I
<br>
| not draw a line - and I'm not sure that Finney realizes the logical
<br>
|  implication of his modesty.  But also this:  Finney is undeniably
<br>
| correct that if most people followed his advice and accepted all
<br>
| contemporary science without daring to draw lines, they would be
<br>
| better off.  Better off, that is, in the matter of their maps
<br>
| conforming to the territory.  Their personal development would be
<br>
| impeded, and they could not build further upon the edifice of
<br>
| science; they would have accepted an Authority.  Yet the mere
<br>
| morals of science matter not to Bayesianity. Their score went up,
<br>
| and there Judgment ends.
<br>
<p>Except that there is no authority for accepting a scientific theory
<br>
other than ones own rationality. Published science is neither correct,
<br>
sound, consistent, accessible, static or authoritative. I would
<br>
question whether anyone could in fact /learn/ any large body of
<br>
science WITHOUT questioning it, just because of the impossibility of
<br>
unquestioningly accepting any logically inconsistent position.
<br>
<p>| I cannot accept the modesty argument lightly, because I know better
<br>
|  than to bow in that direction and then keep on with what I was
<br>
| doing.  If I sound immodest, it is because my behavior is immodest
<br>
| however it is disguised, and I have learned better than to disguise
<br>
| it.
<br>
<p>I would agree that in some cases, one has to back oneself.
<br>
<p>| &quot;True love takes its own course through uncharted territory. It
<br>
| knows no fences, has no barriers or boundaries. It's difficult to
<br>
| define, eludes modern measurement, and seems scientifically woolly.
<br>
| But I know true love exists. I just can't prove it.&quot;
<br>
|
<br>
| You, or I, can hear the sound of Buss's brain clicking off, the
<br>
| metallic clunk as the train ratchets off the rationality track.
<br>
| Buss didn't hear it, but you and I do.
<br>
<p>Indeed. It's like he is also saying that he cannot argue for it
<br>
convincingly, nor does even he think it is rational, nor is there any
<br>
convincing or plausibly speculative case by which one might claim it
<br>
is reasonable to believe it. However, this might be because his
<br>
rhetorical skills are poor, not because of a failure of thought.
<br>
<p>| Buss is, by all that I have heard of him, an excellent evolutionary
<br>
|  scientist.  He fails on this question of 'true love' because it
<br>
| occupies a separate magisterium to him.
<br>
<p>I am often surprised by people's unawareness of the magisteria they
<br>
have. The phrase was new to me, but the idea is obvious enough. Often
<br>
when I talk to people they cross from one to the other without
<br>
noticing. It is a similar idea to Wittgenstein's language games,
<br>
another very useful concept.
<br>
<p>| To me there is no question of being 'allowed' to escape the naughty
<br>
|  constraints of reason into some sacred magisterium where I am
<br>
| finally allowed to relax with some comfortable nonsense.  I would
<br>
| just be swapping in an engine that didn't work.
<br>
<p>I think you are possibly on shaky ground when making this claim. I
<br>
will try to explain when I have my mind wrapped round what you are
<br>
saying a bit better, but I think you should be open to the possibility
<br>
that people's minds are doing something sensible when they make wooly
<br>
comments, even though the conscious thought is illogical or
<br>
inconsistent. I ALSO think you are largely correct, I am merely
<br>
pointing to there being room for some subtlety.
<br>
<p>| I can only improve my individual map of my individual errors by
<br>
| rendering it a detailed description of myself, not by turning it
<br>
| into a set of categorical imperatives that sound like fair
<br>
| political arguments, for to say what is true of everyone loses the
<br>
| individual detail.
<br>
<p>Presumably you mean &quot;imperatives that I have put into categories&quot; as
<br>
opposed to Kant's Categorical Imperative, of which there is
<br>
definitionally only one.
<br>
<p>| But it would not be the Way that leads to the very highest score I
<br>
| can wring from my human brain.  And I am not everyone, even taking
<br>
| into account that everyone thinks they are not everyone.
<br>
<p>Is it possible that you cannot obtain accurate self-knowledge in any
<br>
complete sense of the word, and in fact, that the accuracy might be
<br>
traded off against the completeness, and possibly also best-case with
<br>
average-case performance? I know I am highly error-prone, especially
<br>
in particular contexts, but I still rank myself as being intelligent,
<br>
and having access to unusual perceptions both of myself and others. I
<br>
don't think it is an accurate picture for everybody that you are drawing.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
