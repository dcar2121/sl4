You're probably right; any universe that could
<br>
not support a fair amount of
<br>
creativity/self-expression/play presumably could
<br>
not support intelligent life at all; I don't
<br>
think the cosmos itself has an objective
<br>
morality. But it has room for choices, and it's
<br>
not really that difficult to see that some of
<br>
them are conducive to a complex, vibrant society
<br>
and others are not. One can sort many choices
<br>
neatly into the first category (good for complex,
<br>
vibrant society) or the second (bad for complex,
<br>
vibrant society), and the first category includes
<br>
a lot of what I would call ethical behavior,
<br>
while the second includes much I would call
<br>
unethical. Category one includes truth-telling,
<br>
nonviolent resolution of disputes, equal rights
<br>
under the law, tolerance of dissent, and so
<br>
forth. Their opposites (lying, violence,
<br>
discrimination, repression) can also be found,
<br>
but just look at the societies where these are
<br>
most rampant. They're a mess! The most corrupt,
<br>
violent societies also tend to be less creative
<br>
places with bad economies and poor living
<br>
conditions. One can say, &quot;Well, but those
<br>
societies still manage to get by,&quot; but in the
<br>
longer run that may not be true at all. Consider
<br>
Easter Island after the trees ran out, descending
<br>
into dictatorships and internecine warfare. One
<br>
needn't assert that 'moral values are objective
<br>
and universal' to stipulate that many of them are
<br>
widespread because those groups which neglect
<br>
them have a way of killing themselves off.
