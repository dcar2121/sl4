<p>
Brilliant Ben!  In fact that's exactly what I've been
<br>
trying to intuitively say all along ;)  I'm pleased to
<br>
note that this seems to be at least partially based on
<br>
conversations that took place on SL4.  
<br>
<p>Any way, what you wrote is almost exactly what I
<br>
*would* have written if I had your knowledge and IQ. 
<br>
You've 'extrapolated my volition' ;)  
<br>
<p>I feel we're actually starting to close in on the
<br>
outlines of the real theory of morality.
<br>
<p>There is just one radical modification I want to
<br>
suggest.... ;)
<br>
<p>You say that ITSSIM doesn't suggest any content for
<br>
the goal system...it doesn't tell us what the AI
<br>
should do.  I wonder.  What I want to suggest that the
<br>
ITSSIM procedure will only work for *some* initial
<br>
goals.  So I think that there is a class of initial
<br>
goals that will be stable (can meet the ITSSIM
<br>
requirements) and a class of initial goals that won't.
<br>
&nbsp;And guess what the magic class of valid initial goals
<br>
is...Suppose it's precisely the one's that represent
<br>
Friendly goals?
<br>
<p>In that case, working out ITSSIM would completely
<br>
solve the problem of initial content and visa versa. 
<br>
Not just any old initial input will work for the
<br>
ITSSIM function.  There will be some particular class
<br>
of goals that serve as valid input data for the ITSSIM
<br>
function and I conjecture that the 'valid input' for
<br>
which the ITSSIM function provides a sensible answer
<br>
is precisely Friendly goals only.  
<br>
<p>I'm saying that Content constrains Structure and
<br>
Structure constrains Content.  To understand a little
<br>
better what I'm getting at, please read my other post
<br>
('Does Friendliness Structure constrain Content and
<br>
visa versa')
<br>
<p>We're closing man.  No doubt about it.  I've been
<br>
having a torrent of ideas recently and at last a real
<br>
theory is starting to emerge from my initial
<br>
gibberish!
<br>
<p>The 'top-down strategy' for my own little AGI project
<br>
is nearly complete.  For a very brief outline of some
<br>
my key ideas, I refer you again to my essay 'Towards a
<br>
Science Of Morality' (now slightly revised):
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.imminst.org/forum/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=3&amp;t=5257&amp;s">http://www.imminst.org/forum/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=3&amp;t=5257&amp;s</a><br>
<p>and also my final skeleton outline for my 8-level
<br>
model of intelligence (of course this is only a vague
<br>
intuitive starting point, not a real design):
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sl4.org/wiki/TheWay">http://www.sl4.org/wiki/TheWay</a>
<br>
<p>The time for bullshit is over.  Time to get real.  No
<br>
more philosophy, no more gibberish, no more fuzzy
<br>
thinking.  Just hard logic and maths.
<br>
<p>In short, it's time for me to hit the books at last...
<br>
<p>P.S The sooner Yudkowsky and Wilson realize I'm right
<br>
about everything, the better for everyone ;)
