<p>Neurons &quot;compute&quot; it by having protein complexes with specific voltage-gated
<br>
thresholds for activation.  In the case of the neurons that they're describing,
<br>
if you watch a trace of the voltage potential across the membrane in the
<br>
dendrites, it drops off more slowly than in other neurons, so that a rapid
<br>
succession of spikes is additive, and it takes several spikes (the exact number
<br>
varies) for activation.  I'm not sure what the reason for this is, whether it's
<br>
impossible to do with the classic neuron model, or just needless
<br>
complexification.  I can propose a mechanism for why it exist:  some neurons
<br>
act as signal-unifying centers, so that the brain deems a particular set of
<br>
signals worthy of a response only when a sufficient number of signals from
<br>
disparate areas comes in.
