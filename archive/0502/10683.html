<p>It is possible to develop a decent legal system
<br>
based on your ideas, John - although you might
<br>
not have insanity or youth as a defense.
<br>
This approach (never considering circumstances
<br>
in any legal case), called legalism, was tried in
<br>
China about 1000 years ago, and the results were
<br>
so unpopular that the empire was overthrown
<br>
after only a few years.
<br>
<p>In our legal system, we consider circumstances.
<br>
Someone who mugged someone because his children
<br>
were hungry would be judged differently from
<br>
someone who did it for fun.
<br>
<p>A different aspect of this issue:
<br>
Ethics are not just for developing law.
<br>
Ethics are also a matter for individual consideration.
<br>
Qhat sort of person do you want to be?
<br>
<p>If you have no theory of ethics other than
<br>
social consequences, then how can you have any theory
<br>
of individual ethics as something different from
<br>
social ethics?  And if you don't, aren't you saying
<br>
that the only motivation for observing the law is
<br>
avoiding negative consequences to yourself?
<br>
<p>That is how we model
<br>
people in developing laws, but actually only a
<br>
few people act that way, and we call them
<br>
sociopaths, and our social systems wouldn't
<br>
actually work if everyone were like them.
