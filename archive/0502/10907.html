<em>&gt; I'm disappointed in myself and others that this or other special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose list still hasn't morphed into mainly a theory-extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forum for discussing technical topics directly related to SeedAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Friendliness.
</em><br>
<p>I'm disappointed about that too. But seed AI is just too dangerous
<br>
to start handing out blueprints to people who don't have a clue
<br>
about friendliness, refuse to acknowledge the depth of the problem
<br>
and would cheerfully destroy the world if they got the chance. While
<br>
the majority of list participants do not meet this description,
<br>
there are plenty who do and it only takes one reckless half-brilliant
<br>
project to build an Unfriendly AI for it to be Game Over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's just that the knowledge requirements to contribute anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to the existing theory appear so high that there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardly anyone who can meet them.
</em><br>
<p>Thus the low expected utility of a public discussion; it probably
<br>
wouldn't be worth the time even if the planetkill risk wasn't there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By taking account of what you know vs. everything you need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know to write code. If you're at the stage where you still don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know what you don't know then, yes, your reaction is appropriate.
</em><br>
<p>This is seed AI. There will be things we didn't know we didn't know
<br>
no matter how much theoretical effort we put in prior to the first
<br>
successful AGI project. The best we can hope to accomplish is being
<br>
reasonably sure that none of the things we don't know we don't know
<br>
are going to prove fatal.
