<em>&gt;&gt; More specifically to your comment on free will: In fact, increasing

<em>&gt;&gt; knowledge of causes enhances, rather than diminishes, free will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Consider the freedoms we enjoy today in virtually every area of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lives. We can choose from a much wider range of options, and take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; action on these choices, to an extent never experienced by our

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; our increased understanding of how things work, and if things didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; work in a fully determined way, then our ability to predict, make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; choices, and control would be severely reduced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are talking about the range of actions possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to an agent.  I am talking about the extent to which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we regard those actions as taken freely vs. as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determined.  In fact, increasing knowledge of causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causes more and more actions to be seen as determined,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and it is easy to extrapolate from this trend, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from our materialism, that all actions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I replaced the key part of my statement above: that for us to enjoy free
<br>
will we depend on our universe being a deterministic one.  The paradox
<br>
arises from using the wrong context.  Within the subjective context from
<br>
which we choose and act, we experience free will.  From the ultimate
<br>
objective context, there is no self to experience free will.  It may be
<br>
helpful to consider that everyone else (but you) might be a zombie and
<br>
there would be no measurable difference in the actions you observe.
<br>
<p>Phil, I think it's clear we're not achieving the convergence of thought
<br>
I had hoped for here.  The apparent esteem with which you quote Gould is
<br>
a strong indicator of fundamental differences in our thinking.
<br>
<p>Out of respect to others on this list, I will defer further discussion
<br>
pending development of effective didactic materials.  If anyone wishes
<br>
to pursue this offline, I'll be happy to do so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I don't know what you mean, but I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you cannot dismiss this difficulty so easily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Apparently you think you have trivially solved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a problem that has vexed the world's best minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for at least 2000 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Thanks for the compliment, but I had hoped to be challenged directly on
<br>
the issues I present in simple language but certainly from an unfamiliar
<br>
point of view.  Instead it seems that you have repeatedly clipped out
<br>
the heart of my arguments and resorted to citing, sometimes incorrectly,
<br>
ostensive authorities you admit have been vexed by the problem.  It's
<br>
not an intrinsically difficult problem, but one that requires abandoning
<br>
evolved biases that feel so very true.
<br>
