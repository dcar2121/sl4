<p>
When I invited Cory Doctorow to be a guest at Penguicon he asked to
<br>
present a panel about &quot;The Hidden Totalitarian Assumptions of I,
<br>
Robot.&quot; I've been curious ever since.
<br>
<p>Now it turns out he's published a new story about it on the Infinite
<br>
Matrix website titled I, Robot.
<br>
<a href="http://infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/i-robot.html">http://infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/i-robot.html</a> After the story
<br>
he writes, &quot;Last spring, in the wake of Ray Bradbury pitching a
<br>
tantrum over Michael Moore appropriating the title of 'Fahrenheit 451'
<br>
to make Fahrenheit 9/11, I conceived of a plan to write a series of
<br>
stories with the same titles as famous sf shorts, which would pick
<br>
apart the toalitarian assumptions underpinning some of sf's classic
<br>
narratives.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's an excellent story but I still don't get the point. The money
<br>
quote is probably this: &quot;You live in a country where it is illegal to
<br>
express certain mathematics in software, where state apparatchiks
<br>
regulate all innovation, where inconvenient science is criminalized,
<br>
where whole avenues of experimentation and research are shut down in
<br>
the service of a half-baked superstition about the moral qualities of
<br>
your three laws, and _you_ call _my_ home corrupt?&quot; But as far as I
<br>
can tell, some characters decided to be totalitarian dictators, and
<br>
other characters in their society allowed them to be, for reasons
<br>
which I can only dimly connect to the three laws or to Asimov's book,
<br>
probably because it's been years since I read it. (The movie, which
<br>
was a script called Hard Wired until they slapped the I, Robot name on
<br>
it for no good reason, doesn't count.) Why don't the Eurasian robots,
<br>
who are not &quot;3 Laws Safe,&quot; run amok and take over the world? Why are
<br>
they Friendly AI? The story does not say. In asking that question, am
<br>
I making one of the totalitarian assumptions of I, Robot?
<br>
<p>A few months ago I bought it the e-book from Fictionwise.com, but
<br>
Digital Rights Management screwed me out of my property because my
<br>
credit card had expired, so I can't read it. I don't know if I'd call
<br>
that totalitarian though.
<br>
