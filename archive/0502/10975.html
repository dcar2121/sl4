Ben -
<br>
<p>Some comments on your ITSSIM:
<br>
<p>It seems to have inherited some resemblance to our discussion during 
<br>
Jan-Feb 2004.
<br>
<p>For example:
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0401/7798.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0401/7798.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0401/7800.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0401/7800.html</a>
<br>
<p>In particular, your examples of the man who is uploaded, or the dog that 
<br>
has its intelligence enhanced, corresponds to my emphasis on expanded 
<br>
scope of awareness as a key element of an effective ethical theory for 
<br>
our future. I use the common example of a child being angry with a 
<br>
parent, while the parent, having a greater scope of awareness, is making 
<br>
better choices for the good of the child. I further abstract this 
<br>
concept of scope of awareness to include /groups /of individuals, 
<br>
sharing a set of common goals, sharing their perceptions and knowledge 
<br>
of their world. In moral reasoning it is essential that the definition 
<br>
of Self not be limited to a physical body, but be that with which one 
<br>
subjectively identifies.
<br>
<p>Regarding the idea of incremental theorem-proving, this appears to be 
<br>
congruent with my saying:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It seems to me that the ultimate measure of an ethical system is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistency. Within nested context levels, the consistency of ethical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principles should increase as the context becomes broader.&quot;
<br>
<p>Three key observations from your paper:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. You mention there are two costs in the ITSSIM approach. I agree
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a cost, an economic factor which is a good indication of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a theory grounded in reality, but I think your two costs are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually two different views of the same cost of evaluating the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moral consistency of the direction of progress.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. There is an inherent subjective relationship that is implied with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your smaller, less complex system evaluating the progress of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;larger, more complex system, and you point out the conundrum of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computing resources this would require. I will suggest a way of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;un-asking how this should be handled.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. You say &quot;In any case, the creators of the initial AI would have no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guarantee of what the long-term result would be – all we’d know is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, each step of the way, the change would seem like a good idea
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on extremely rigorous reasoning.&quot; I strongly agree with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this, but would redefine &quot;based on extremely rigorous reasoning&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to &quot;based on principles of effective interaction&quot;, with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implication that the process continues to evolve within a larger
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environment rather than having a fixed mathematical basis.
<br>
<p>Now, here is where my thinking appears to diverge with yours and most on 
<br>
this list:
<br>
<p>We, as subsystems of human society and beyond, are part of a 
<br>
self-improving system. We incorporate our values, an approximation of 
<br>
the values we would wish to hold given greater scope of awareness, in 
<br>
our interactions with Other, and in the process we grow in alignment 
<br>
with our values. Subjectively, we see as good &quot;that which works&quot;, and 
<br>
this drives the direction of improvement. Objectively, interaction 
<br>
between Self and Other is more effective with increased scope of 
<br>
awareness, and with application of principles of synergetic cooperation. 
<br>
And thus, recursively, the larger system grows and we influence our 
<br>
growth within it.
<br>
<p>Rather than looking inward, building a singleton AI in an attempt to 
<br>
model the chaotic dynamical system of which we are a part and influence 
<br>
its direction from a central position as if just the right force and 
<br>
vector could be calculated, we should be looking outward, building 
<br>
intelligent tools to improve our perception and knowledge of our world, 
<br>
from a broad base that already embodies human values, constrained by the 
<br>
economics of what works, and therefore on the path to good.
<br>
<p>Some say &quot;We don't have time to help humanity save itself; we have to 
<br>
save the world via our focused brilliance.&quot; The only effective response 
<br>
I know of is to highlight the importance of context, and nested scopes 
<br>
of awareness.
