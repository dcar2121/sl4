</em><br>
<em>&gt; different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ‘types’ of musical enhancement are there?  (Is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite number of different possible ways in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could ‘enhance’ a given piece of music or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of different possible ways)?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
This is a subject I have thought on for years,
<br>
and there are some answers already available.
<br>
Music has a Kolmogorov complexity like most
<br>
everything else; there is finite number of sounds
<br>
you could put into three minutes, as there is a
<br>
finite number of possible novels (we are assuming
<br>
that nobody but transhumans and SAI's want to
<br>
hear million-minute symphonies or read
<br>
billion-page epics, and that's still finite). The
<br>
arrangements you would find pleasing to hear are
<br>
a small subset, and they have mathematically
<br>
interesting properties. It follows that there are
<br>
finite types/ways of enhancement, some of which I
<br>
will describe.
<br>
The music we usually listen to is based on a
<br>
twelve-tone scale (even if there are odd noises
<br>
and samples thrown in). To go up an octave, you
<br>
double the frequency, and this is divided into
<br>
twelve equal steps. Twelve is a groovy number
<br>
which divides evenly in a lot of ways for such a
<br>
small number, and musical theory has been digging
<br>
around its divisors and their incestuous
<br>
relationships for centuries.
<br>
<p>One can imagine getting tired of twelve-tone
<br>
music. I once read that its possibilities had
<br>
been fully explored by jazz musicians early in
<br>
the last century and that more recent popular
<br>
music was simply regurgitating what they had
<br>
discovered; I was scandalized, but this view is
<br>
not necessarily wrong, and Brian Eno says that
<br>
newer music innovates in other areas while using
<br>
older forms (i.e. sonic textures and samples,
<br>
laid over the same twelve tone scales). Other
<br>
microtonal scales exist which divide the octave
<br>
in many different ways (quarter tones, 43-note
<br>
scales, 31 notes, and so on). Google 'microtonal
<br>
music' for more. This sort of music has been
<br>
around for quite a while too, but it's an
<br>
acquired taste limited to ethnic minorities and
<br>
scholars, and perhaps needs its own Mozart or
<br>
Beatles to reach the masses. Microtonal scales,
<br>
however, theoretically offer many forms of beauty
<br>
which have never been heard by the human ear.
<br>
<p>It is worth noting that what humans find pleasing
<br>
has mathematical interest as well, and
<br>
corollaries exist in other arts; a Discover
<br>
Magazine article shows how Jackson Pollock
<br>
masterpieces have fractal dimension, while fakes
<br>
do not. The best music contains interesting
<br>
melodic/harmonic patterns, interesting rhythmic
<br>
patterns (time broken up in mathematically
<br>
interesting ways), and, if there are lyrics,
<br>
interesting word structures and emotive
<br>
components.
<br>
For example, one book recommends that songwriters
<br>
sit down with their lyrics and lots of colored
<br>
markers. Rhymes should be marked with one color,
<br>
internal rhymes another. Metaphors, similes,
<br>
onomatopoeia, visual words, words which evoke
<br>
touch, smell, etc., all get different colors.
<br>
Ideally, the lyric sheet will be a riot of color
<br>
when you are done, giving a visual key to the
<br>
complexity of the lyric. I recently read a poet
<br>
who explained that a poem was like a machine
<br>
where every single word should be necessary, like
<br>
a screw or a cam.
<br>
In addition, the melody should reflect the lyric,
<br>
and vice versa, as for example in &quot;Animals&quot; when
<br>
David Byrne sings &quot;down, down, down, down&quot; in
<br>
descending, gruff notes suggesting a command
<br>
given to an unruly dog.
<br>
<p>If you have followed me this far, you can see
<br>
that there are layers of psychoacoustic
<br>
complexity underlying the best music. In this
<br>
case, a 'degradation algorithm' is easy to make,
<br>
because almost any random change you can make is
<br>
likely to degrade a well-made piece of music,
<br>
which can in reality be a fiendishly subtle and
<br>
balanced creation. An 'enhancement algorithm', as
<br>
you can see, is likely to be limited in its
<br>
reach. It may be effective on a very simple or
<br>
flawed piece of music, but music of high quality
<br>
is already the product of a number of enhancement
<br>
algorithms which the artist has consciously or
<br>
subconsciously applied (the latter case will be
<br>
described as 'having a good ear' just as Jackson
<br>
Pollock's ability to create fractal dimension
<br>
with drips and splatters might be termed 'a good
<br>
eye').
