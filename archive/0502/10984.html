<p><p>| Perhaps we were talking past each other then, because that's
<br>
| exactly what I'm advocating; &quot;circumventing evolution&quot; is a term
<br>
| I'd use to describe this, but if you want to use a different term
<br>
| then I don't have a problem with that.
<br>
<p>I think there is something we disagree about. You seem to be worried
<br>
that Friendliness will *evolve into* a paperclip machine (or
<br>
whatever). Firstly, I think anything smart enough to deserve the name
<br>
will also have the intelligence to interpret any goal it recieves in a
<br>
non-naive way. Secondly, I don't think we need to try to hard-wire in
<br>
some goal that cannot be removed - we just need to look at the system
<br>
dynamics in such a way that evolutionary pressure will *encourage*
<br>
Friendliness rather than a paperclip machine.
<br>
<p>|&gt; It's not about 'escaping' evolutionary pressure - that is like
<br>
|&gt; saying that everything would be easier if the laws of the
<br>
|&gt; universe were different. Survival of the fittest /will/ happen.
<br>
|&gt; We need to ensure that something interesting is the fittest
<br>
|&gt; thing.
<br>
|
<br>
| Okay, how do you propose to do this?
<br>
<p>Well, I think designing in a reasonable sense of self-preservation of
<br>
identity into the AGI and using a reproductive model will mostly take
<br>
care of things. No individual intelligence that values its own
<br>
existence is going to wilfully construct an offspring which will
<br>
guarantee its own demise, unless perhaps it regards its own demise as
<br>
inevitable, and can fulfil some other important goals by doing so. It
<br>
is a short step from self-preservation to morality.
<br>
<p>|&gt; Oh, and I read some of the mail archive, and ended up on a page
<br>
|&gt; by Ben Goetzel talking about &quot;Solomonoff Induction&quot;. Is anyone
<br>
|&gt; interested in my pointing out some implied assumptions I found in
<br>
|&gt; there, or has this already been done to death?
<br>
|
<br>
|
<br>
| I'd be interested in hearing them.
<br>
<p>I'll get round to them... real life keeps getting in the way. Watch
<br>
this space...
