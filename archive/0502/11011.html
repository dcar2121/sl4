This wasn't too bad, in the end, since he did quote Kurzweil at-length.
<br>
If you email the author, feel free to forward me your response.

<p>That Singularity sensation
<br>
<p>By Alex Beam, Globe Columnist  |  February 24, 2005
<br>
<p>Inventor/entrepreneur Ray Kurzweil has become the high-tech version of the
<br>
cartoon character carrying the sign: &quot;The End Is Near.&quot; With dogged
<br>
consistency, the founder of eight different technology companies has been
<br>
proselytizing an end-of-humantime event called the Singularity, a Buck Rogers
<br>
vision of the hypothetical Christian Rapture.
<br>
<p>Like everything, the term was first coined by mathematician John von Neumann,
<br>
who spoke a half-century ago of &quot;the ever accelerating progress of technology
<br>
. . . approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race.&quot; More
<br>
recently, San Diego State computer scientist Vernor Vinge has predicted that
<br>
man-made &quot;entities with greater than human intelligence&quot; would dominate the
<br>
planet.
<br>
<p>In his forthcoming book, &quot;The Singularity Is Near,&quot; Kurzweil calls the
<br>
Singularity &quot;the inevitable next step in the evolutionary process.&quot; Already,
<br>
human activity is enhanced by technological substitutes, e.g., robotic
<br>
prostheses, artificial skin, blood plasma, etc. The Singularity, which
<br>
Kurzweil says will occur at mid-century, is the moment when biological
<br>
material ceases to exist, and we become products of the revolution in &quot;GNR&quot;:
<br>
genetics, nanotechnology, and robotics.
<br>
<p>It's as if the flesh and blood Neo of &quot;The Matrix&quot; progressively morphed into
<br>
the digital Agent Smith. See, that was easy.
<br>
<p>Naturally, Singularitarians have been greeted with hooting skepticism.
<br>
Kurzweil allows that few people are yet &quot;Singularity-aware,&quot; and he expresses
<br>
surprise that even Nobel Prize winners have attacked him. (That's why they
<br>
have Nobel Prizes, no?) To be fair, Kurzweil welcomes questions about his
<br>
idiosyncratic views. In conjunction with the Singularity, he has long been
<br>
plugging the idea of radical life extension, for which he has been
<br>
&quot;aggressively reprogramming&quot; his biochemistry,&quot; pumping about 250 pills a day
<br>
into his 57-year-old &quot;version 1.0 body.&quot;
<br>
<p>But I am more interested in the religious implications of the Singularity. How
<br>
is this techno-Apocalypse so different from Judeo-Christian end-of-time
<br>
scenarios, or from the Rapture, the now-popularized notion that Jesus Christ
<br>
will soon swoop down from the heavens and embrace (Christian) mankind with
<br>
salvation?
<br>
<p>Raised as a Unitarian, Kurzweil realizes that outsiders seize on the spiritual
<br>
dimension of the Singularity. In his book, he reprints a private exchange with
<br>
Bill Gates on this subject:
<br>
<p>&quot;Bill: . . . So is there a God in this religion?
<br>
<p>Ray: Not yet, but there will be. . . . Ultimately the Universe will become
<br>
saturated with intelligence. It will 'wake up,' be conscious and sublimely
<br>
intelligent. That's about as close to God as I can imagine.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kurzweil waxes astringent on religion, which he says exists primarily &quot;to
<br>
rationalize death, since up until just now there was little else constructive
<br>
we could do about it.&quot; &quot;But I'm not promoting a religion based on faith,&quot; he
<br>
explains, &quot;except the belief that the Universe actually exists and that there
<br>
is something going on other than thoughts in my own mind. My thinking has not
<br>
gotten a lot of resistance from Christian thinkers, because they see the
<br>
Singularity as a scientific reflection of what they've always believed.
<br>
<p>&quot;I always knew something profound was going to happen around the middle of the
<br>
21st century, it's just that I got there through science.&quot;
<br>
<p>Found object
<br>
Shall I compare thee to a Summers' day?
<br>
Thou art not modest nor yet temperate.
<br>
Rough winds do shake the Mass-y Halls of clay,
<br>
And Summers' lease hath all too short a date
<br>
Sometime too hot the seat of power glows,
<br>
And fair and dark and wise sometime combine,
<br>
To bring the course of Summers to its close
<br>
And thy 'eternal' Tenure shall soon fade
<br>
And lose possession of that Hall thou hir'd;
<br>
The learned have given thee thy grade.
<br>
So go thy way or know thou willst be fired
<br>
Now that ladies count and Hebrews farm,
<br>
Now farewell to all of Summers' gold'n charm.
