<p>Most people would probably agree with you, the law is based on it too
<br>
and that is why the criminal court system is such a mess, it’s based on
<br>
an absurdity. I don’t have a rigid definition of good and evil but my
<br>
rule of thumb is that if someone or something generally causes misery to
<br>
those who encounters it then it is probably evil, if it’s joy rather
<br>
than misery then it’s probably good; the reasons why the person or thing
<br>
has these effects on other people is (almost) always irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the movie, &quot;What the bleep do we know?&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argues for free will by incorporating quantam physics. 
</em><br>
<p>I haven’t seen the movie but I’ll be willing to bet that just as in
<br>
every pop philosophy book it will go on and on trying to prove we have
<br>
free will and never once ask what the term means.  It’s like arguing if
<br>
humans have the clogknee property of not and never explaining what
<br>
clogknee means.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And I don’t see how quantum physics helps in the slightest because even
<br>
&nbsp;in the quantum realm everything, absolutely everything, happens because
<br>
&nbsp;of cause and effect and is thus mechanical OR it does not and thus is
<br>
&nbsp;random. Believers in free will (whatever they mean by it) are unhappy
<br>
&nbsp;being compared with either a Cuckoo clock or a pair of dice but I fear
<br>
&nbsp;they are destined to be unhappy.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; freedom is the act of choosing which reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your subjective consciousness experiences.
</em><br>
<p>The key word is “choosing” and the thing I don’t understand is that even
<br>
the most passionate believer in free will still asks other people “why
<br>
did you do that?” when they do something they don’t understand, that is
<br>
they want a reason, a cause for the action; but they must already know
<br>
the only answer is “because I have free will.” As for me I tend to think
<br>
an inability to provide an answer to “why did you do that?” is a sign of
<br>
irrationality.
