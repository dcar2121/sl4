<p><em>&gt; I totally disagree. In my experience, human beings

</em><br>
<em>&gt; even society in general, is benifical is because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creates a loop where &quot;I scratch your back, you scratch mine.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>About the only thing I could find to disagree with in the above is “I
<br>
totally disagree”.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It sounds like you would like utilititarianism, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well as Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Sirens of Titan&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes I like them both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the common line of attack from determinists.
</em><br>
<p>I’m no determinist, no educated man is, we’ve known for 80 years that
<br>
some events have no cause, in other words they are random.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; free will is a different type of cause from typical, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical causation. With what I would &quot;cognitive causation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds are able to view different  possible worlds, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and select from them.
</em><br>
<p>And if they selected that world for a reason then it is no different
<br>
then everyday vanilla cause and effect and if they didn’t then it’s no
<br>
different from everyday vanilla randomness. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is, in a way, the reverse of physical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historically-based causation. 
</em><br>
<p>I’ll be damned if I can find the tiniest particle of difference, in both
<br>
things happened for a reason. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cognitive causation, usually called reasons, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are so different because they are goal-orientated.
</em><br>
<p>So the reason I acted as I did was because of my goal. Ok fine, I have
<br>
no argument with that but it’s no different from saying the compass
<br>
needle moved because of the magnetic field. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; my claim is that  there are (at least) two, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely different types of causation. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes that is your claim, and forget “completely different”, if you can
<br>
demonstrate that they are even a little bit different then you will win
<br>
the argument. You can’t. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think Elizier's articulation on the matter is well worth noting:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Free will&quot; is a cognitive element representing the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game-theoretical unit of moral responsibility. It has nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever  to do with determinism or quantum randomness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Free will doesn't actually exist in reality, but only in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense that flowers don't actually exist  in reality. &quot;
</em><br>
<p>That’s not very useful now is it, Elizier usually does better. Put
<br>
simply the above says little except that people are responsible for
<br>
their actions. So what else is new? He then lists several things that
<br>
free will is not but never actually says what it is. I have no idea
<br>
where he was trying to go with the flowers bit but he didn’t get there.
<br>
<p>If you put a gun to my head and told me to give a definition of free
<br>
will I’d say it’s the inability to always predict one’s own actions even
<br>
in a predictable environment and even if quantum mechanics didn’t exist
<br>
and we lived in Newtonian mechanical universe. By that definition we do
<br>
indeed have free will.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that one of the reasons why the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free-will vs. determinism is so recurrent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because both sides tend to assume that the other is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denying the imporatance of their type of causation. 
</em><br>
<p>I only know of one type of causation, an event happening for a reason.
<br>
<p>On my own behalf, of my own free will, I consciously decide to go to a
<br>
restaurant.
<br>
Why? 
<br>
Because I want to. 
<br>
Why ? 
<br>
Because I want to eat. 
<br>
Why? 
<br>
Because I'm hungry? 
<br>
Why ? 
<br>
Because lack of food triggered nerve impulses in my stomach, my brain 
<br>
interpreted these signals as pain, I can only stand so much before I try
<br>
to stop it. 
<br>
<p>Why? 
<br>
Because I don't like pain. 
<br>
Why? 
<br>
Because that's the way my brain is wired. 
<br>
Why? 
<br>
Because my body and the hardware of my brain were made from the
<br>
information in my genetic code (lets see, 6 billion base pairs 2 bits
<br>
per base pairs 8 bits per byte that comes out to about 1.5 geg, compress
<br>
it into a zip file and you could burn it onto a CD several times over).
<br>
The programming of my brain came from the environment, add a little
<br>
quantum randomness perhaps and 
<br>
<p>On my own behalf, of my own free will, I consciously decide to go to a
<br>
restaurant.
