Subject: Re: Ethics
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The earliest I've ever heard of demarchy (the name given to randomly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected people ruling) is in Athens, after Solon the Lawgiver's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reforms.  Borges was not the first, but he did point out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere in the system you must get rid of chaos and lot choosing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it leads to infinite recursion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And Buckner, your idea sounds a lot like open-source governance (Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that movement have a proper name? All I know is the suggestions that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we apply open-source FOSS ideas to governance is not new, and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attracting attention.).
</em><br>
<p>I think randomly selecting people to govern is a *very* bad idea.  The only
<br>
time it approaches being acceptable is when all the people could make
<br>
decisions *equally* well.  That is definitely not the case in our current
<br>
world and probably wouldn't be the case in an environment peopled
<br>
exclusively by transhumans.
<br>
<p>Picking people to look after most decisions should fall to people who are
<br>
qualified.  The really big decisions should be decided by a relatively small
<br>
group of the best decision makers.  The model of a private medium size
<br>
corporation comes to mind, with it's president to make day to day decisions
<br>
and a board of directors to make the big decisions.  The board would be
<br>
elected by the people based on their proven decision making abilities.  The
<br>
president and other high ranking people would be appointed on merit by the
<br>
board.  Normally only the president is directly hired by a current board (of
<br>
directors) and then the president hires all others but I think the major
<br>
players other than the president could be appointed by the board as well.
<br>
<p>I totally reject the idea many people have that *anyone* should be able to
<br>
be an elected official.  That an elected official needs to have no special
<br>
talents.  If you were picking a financial advisor, would you choose any
<br>
loser off the street to entrust your money to?  If you wouldn't do that with
<br>
your own money, why should society do that with it's collective money?  Even
<br>
in an environment where only transhumans live, there will be many
<br>
intelligent and gifted people who have no aptitude or skill at making
<br>
collective decisions.  Linus Pauling might have been a brilliant chemist and
<br>
researcher but he definitely got in wrong with vitamin C.  No matter how
<br>
smart someone is, they can't be best or correct at everything.
<br>
<p>I previously made a comment about juries not being qualified mentally to
<br>
understand and judge most trials today.  This is even more true when you are
<br>
talking about who should make collective decisions.
