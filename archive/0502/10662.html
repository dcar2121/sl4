</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Picking people to look after most decisions

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; decided by a relatively small
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There are factors you fail to consider. One is
<br>
the divide between 'best decision makers' and
<br>
'Machiavellian gameplayers who can convince
<br>
millions of gullible mortals that they are the
<br>
best decision makers.' No dictator can destroy
<br>
millions of lives without lots of help, lots of
<br>
disciples, lots of police and soldiers who follow
<br>
orders. A well-designed random system makes
<br>
political coalitions impossible as we presently
<br>
understand them, and thus dilutes the influence
<br>
of thugs.
<br>
Also, bear in mind that any system that
<br>
eliminates campaigns eliminates the de facto
<br>
bribery of campaign contributions, and frees
<br>
decision makers from worrying that a
<br>
conscientious decision will cost them
<br>
re-election.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, a more detailed description of my
<br>
proposal would include making sure the pool is of
<br>
those who are qualified, or at least not stupid
<br>
and not insane. If we need licenses to fly planes
<br>
or perform surgery, why not to govern?
<br>
<p>One of the major points of a random system is the
<br>
proposition that 'who can make decisions well'
<br>
is, in current political systems, usually the
<br>
self-assigned function of gatekeepers and
<br>
kingmakers whose motives are not necessarily
<br>
pure, and I could easily name scores of wise
<br>
people who will never be allowed near the levers
<br>
of power. Under current systems, a very
<br>
destructive Hitler or Stalin (and their cadre of
<br>
morally and intellectually deficient minions) can
<br>
end up running a whole nation, while a very
<br>
creative Buckminster Fuller or George Bernard
<br>
Shaw will not (and wouldn't you like to live in a
<br>
world where that could happen?) President Fuller
<br>
is still unlikely under a random system, but not
<br>
impossible as under the current system. It would
<br>
also obviate 'district shopping' and
<br>
gerrymandering since a qualified person would not
<br>
need to move to an area dominated by like-minded
<br>
people to have any chance of success.
<br>
<p>A random system would tend to eliminate 'winner
<br>
take all' phenomena where a slim majority can
<br>
steamroll a large minority. In a random system
<br>
the overall structure of policy making would
<br>
closely track the actual proportion of views in
<br>
the population.
<br>
<p>A random system can be seen not as a 'choosing
<br>
the best' system but as a 'preventing the worst'
<br>
system. I do not see our present system as a
<br>
'choosing the best' system any more; I have seen
<br>
it fail too consistently over the past couple of
<br>
decades, and in an increasingly predictable way.
<br>
A powerful, well-funded authoritarian coalition,
<br>
which does not actually believe in democracy, has
<br>
disabled the checks and balances in this country
<br>
and now rules almost unopposed. To put it in
<br>
computer-security terms, the software had
<br>
security flaws which were identified and
<br>
exploited by unfriendly haxors who are now
<br>
plugging the holes to make sure they cannot be
<br>
evicted.
<br>
<p>As I do not expect the authoritarians to give up
<br>
power, legally or not, peacefully or not, and as
<br>
they now have surveillance and armament
<br>
sufficient to put down any opposition I can
<br>
envision, I do not anticipate a random or
<br>
open-source system here. Only a transhuman or SAI
<br>
can undo what has been done. Even then, it will
<br>
not necessarily matter who 'should' impose hir
<br>
decisions on the rest; it will only be a question
<br>
of who can.
<br>
<p>I am willing to see this particular discussion
<br>
sniped, as it's not exactly AI related; however,
<br>
it does happen to be roughly where I came in. See
<br>
the fictional essay I wrote about three years
<br>
ago, to be included in a book that never appeared
<br>
(I've learned a lot since then, but the general
<br>
idea of the essay still holds).
