<p>
I am now mostly settled in to my new apartment in Santa Clara (I'm near 
<br>
the intersection of Lawrence and Homestead), and I would like to meet my 
<br>
fellow Bay Area transhumanists.  I also hear rumors that there are no 
<br>
frequent regular gatherings of Bay Area transhumanists.  Spike Jones and 
<br>
I have secretly conspired to launch a quarterly meeting of Bay Area 
<br>
transhumanists, which conspiracy I now throw open to the general public.
<br>
<p>I've been to transhumanist gatherings held at restaurants and I've been 
<br>
to transhumanist gatherings held at houses, and the house gatherings 
<br>
were much nicer: people can walk around and talk to all others present, 
<br>
sit down for a few minutes and then get up, and there's no loud music 
<br>
playing as there often is at restaurants.  In restaurants I've usually 
<br>
been able to speak only to the four or five people seated nearest me.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I can't offer my own house, because I don't have a house, 
<br>
I have a small apartment, and I've no space (nor chairs, tables, etc.) 
<br>
for even a small transhumanist gathering.  Would anyone out there like 
<br>
to host this occasion?  It wouldn't imply offering to host every 
<br>
quarterly gathering (unless you want to); there's no reason the 
<br>
gathering shouldn't move around.  Similarly, potluck dinner (everyone 
<br>
brings an item they would want to eat) can substitute for any obligation 
<br>
to prepare food.  We'd just need space and chairs.
<br>
<p>My current nominal bedtime is 9PM; I can probably stretch that an hour 
<br>
or two on any given night, so long as I don't do it twice in a row. 
<br>
What do you think of 5PM as a meeting time?
<br>
