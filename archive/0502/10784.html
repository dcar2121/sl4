<em>&gt; Actually, I do have an ethical (or 'moral') value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function I might suggest, which consists of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple rules. Timothy Ferris once said that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without embracing teleology, it can be said that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our universe looks pretty much they way it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had it been carefully designed for maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity, self-expression, and play (I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find the exact quote).
</em><br>
On what data is that conclusion based? Even that our universe was 
<br>
designed by an optimization process of some kind is a very dubious 
<br>
assumption; its suitability for the formation and existence of 
<br>
optimizing systems (e.g. humans) can be explained through simple 
<br>
observer bias (i.e. barring inter-universe data transmission one isn't 
<br>
likely to observe a universe that unsuitable for running observers).
<br>
<p>That it not only had a 'design specification', but that this 
<br>
specification was based on &quot;creativity, self-expression and play&quot; 
<br>
doesn't look like a likely hypothesis to me.
<br>
Extrapolating from this hypothesis and comparing the result to the 
<br>
observed universe, I'd expect less dead matter and wasted order, or more 
<br>
likely a downright possibility for an unlimited amount of useful 
<br>
computation. The hypothesis doesn't appear to make the observed universe 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an ordinary outcome in retrospect.
<br>
<p>That the universe was designed to execute the laws of physics as known 
<br>
starting from a certain initial matter/energy configuration seems like a 
<br>
much more useful hypothesis to me; but in this case, why drag design 
<br>
into it at all? You can get the same predictions from a simpler 
<br>
hypothesis without that element.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So a good simple ethics can be expressed as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Express and create yourself, as freely and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joyously as you can.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And try not to hurt those people over there.
</em><br>
Wouldn't it be more obvious to promote a fast increase of entropy? After 
<br>
all, increasing entropy appears to be what the universe is continually 
<br>
doing. Assuming it actually was designed to do something simple, 
<br>
wouldn't &quot;move from a state of absolute order to absolute disorder&quot; be a 
<br>
more likely candidate than causing those strange high-level but 
<br>
intuitive-for-humans activities?
<br>
I can't help but think that the paraphrased Timothy Ferris just wanted 
<br>
to elevate their (perceived) subjective highest-level goals to a state 
<br>
of objective ethics/morals.
