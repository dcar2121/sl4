<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a subject I have thought on for years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there are some answers already available.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Music has a Kolmogorov complexity like most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else; there is finite number of sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could put into three minutes, as there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite number of possible novels (we are assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that nobody but transhumans and SAI's want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear million-minute symphonies or read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion-page epics, and that's still finite). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrangements you would find pleasing to hear are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a small subset, and they have mathematically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting properties. It follows that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite types/ways of enhancement, some of which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The music we usually listen to is based on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twelve-tone scale (even if there are odd noises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and samples thrown in). To go up an octave, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; double the frequency, and this is divided into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twelve equal steps. Twelve is a groovy number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which divides evenly in a lot of ways for such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small number, and musical theory has been digging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around its divisors and their incestuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationships for centuries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can imagine getting tired of twelve-tone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music. I once read that its possibilities had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been fully explored by jazz musicians early in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last century and that more recent popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music was simply regurgitating what they had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered; I was scandalized, but this view is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily wrong, and Brian Eno says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newer music innovates in other areas while using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; older forms (i.e. sonic textures and samples,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laid over the same twelve tone scales). Other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microtonal scales exist which divide the octave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in many different ways (quarter tones, 43-note
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scales, 31 notes, and so on). Google 'microtonal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music' for more. This sort of music has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around for quite a while too, but it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquired taste limited to ethnic minorities and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scholars, and perhaps needs its own Mozart or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beatles to reach the masses. Microtonal scales,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, theoretically offer many forms of beauty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which have never been heard by the human ear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is worth noting that what humans find pleasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has mathematical interest as well, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corollaries exist in other arts; a Discover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Magazine article shows how Jackson Pollock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masterpieces have fractal dimension, while fakes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not. The best music contains interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; melodic/harmonic patterns, interesting rhythmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns (time broken up in mathematically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting ways), and, if there are lyrics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting word structures and emotive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, one book recommends that songwriters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sit down with their lyrics and lots of colored
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markers. Rhymes should be marked with one color,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal rhymes another. Metaphors, similes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onomatopoeia, visual words, words which evoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; touch, smell, etc., all get different colors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ideally, the lyric sheet will be a riot of color
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you are done, giving a visual key to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of the lyric. I recently read a poet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who explained that a poem was like a machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where every single word should be necessary, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a screw or a cam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In addition, the melody should reflect the lyric,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and vice versa, as for example in &quot;Animals&quot; when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Byrne sings &quot;down, down, down, down&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descending, gruff notes suggesting a command
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given to an unruly dog.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you have followed me this far, you can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are layers of psychoacoustic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity underlying the best music. In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, a 'degradation algorithm' is easy to make,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because almost any random change you can make is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to degrade a well-made piece of music,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can in reality be a fiendishly subtle and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balanced creation. An 'enhancement algorithm', as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can see, is likely to be limited in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach. It may be effective on a very simple or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flawed piece of music, but music of high quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is already the product of a number of enhancement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms which the artist has consciously or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subconsciously applied (the latter case will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described as 'having a good ear' just as Jackson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pollock's ability to create fractal dimension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with drips and splatters might be termed 'a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye').

<p>Cool.  Interesting.  Just one point - I'm a little
<br>
puzzled why you say there is only a finite number of
<br>
sounds or a finite number of novels.  *In principle*
<br>
at least, that's not the case.  And a proper
<br>
mathematical/logical/philosophical approach has to to
<br>
look at things 'in principle'.
<br>
<p>Logician John Myhill talked about
<br>
'prospective'/'productive' attributes such as beauty
<br>
which are in principle of infinite complexity. 
<br>
('Productive' atrribute- no finite algorithm can list
<br>
or recognize 100% of things possessing the attribute).
