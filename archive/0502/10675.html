Subject: Re: Demarchy (was Re: Ethics)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The thing is, we aren't usually faced with a situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which there is a hard decision to make, and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officials weigh the options and use their intellect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to choose that which is best for the country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are faced with situations in which it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how smart or wise our officials are, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are acting in the interest of a few special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests who fund them, rather than in the interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the country.  It would be better to have a dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person trying to solve our problems, than a dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very smart people trying to use our money to solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some elite group's problems.
</em><br>
<p>If you think the problems put before all levels of government are so
<br>
trivial, I think you should take a look first hand to prove your point.  The
<br>
problem of pandering to special interest groups shouldn't be solved by using
<br>
random or ordinary people.  Too much is at stake.  I agree that special
<br>
interest groups have too much say but how is that helped by using people
<br>
that are obviously less qualified?  What about using better qualified (not
<br>
necessarily the smartest) people and putting a lid on the excesses of the
<br>
special interest groups?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Linus Pauling might have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a brilliant chemist and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; researcher but he definitely got in wrong with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vitamin C.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?  Off-topic:  Linus Pauling was less wrong in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going overboard plugging vitamin C, than the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the medical establishment was in saying, at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, that there was no medical reason to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than 60mg of vitamin C a day (and trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce that by laws prohibiting the sales of larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vitamin supplements).
</em><br>
<p>My point about Linus Pauling is that just because he was very smart in
<br>
Chemistry and got a Nobel Prize, didn't make his fanaticism about high doses
<br>
of vitamin C valid.  A smart correct person in one domain doesn't
<br>
necessarily translate into a correct person in another domain.  I was trying
<br>
to show that just using the smartest people to solve problems doesn't always
<br>
mean you get the best decision making.  However, better decision making in
<br>
general is correlated with intelligence IMHO.
