<p><em>&gt; We are not discussins dogs, chimps,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or humans. We are discussing how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution works. 
</em><br>
<p>I don’t know about you but I am discussing if evolution tends over time
<br>
to produce some animals with more complexity than before. I don’t care
<br>
what Gould says I think it does; if in the process of making these
<br>
advances it also produces organisms with less complexity that is an
<br>
unimportant byproduct. Most would say Shakespeare was a great writer but
<br>
like any writer I am sure from time to time he also wrote junk, however
<br>
he recognized it as such and threw it away himself or time did and the
<br>
junk faded into oblivion and we are left only with the great stuff.
<br>
Because of this we are justified in saying he was a genius ever if some,
<br>
or ever most, of the stuff he wrote was crap.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What species you care about are irrelevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this discussion. 
</em><br>
<p>I don’t think so. I won’t go so far as to say the drive toward
<br>
complexity is the only reason evolution deserves serious study but it is
<br>
a very important reason. If evolution had never been able to produce
<br>
anything more complex than Mycoplasma genitalium and its 480 genes then
<br>
on the theoretical level evolution might still be a little more
<br>
interesting than the chemical processes involved in the vulcanization of
<br>
rubber, but not much.
