<p>This is one of the considerations that have kept
<br>
me from going ahead with a Singularity novel,
<br>
even though I have given it a lot of thought. If
<br>
I get it wrong, it might as well be some Flash
<br>
Gordon dreck. If I get it right, maybe I'm
<br>
disseminating ideas I should have sat on.
<br>
<p>BTW, Eliezer said:
<br>
&quot;My thinking has changed dramatically.  I just
<br>
don't know how to measure 
<br>
that.  Progress is not the same as visible
<br>
progress.&quot; Some have noted with concern that
<br>
'Eliezer was absolutely sure of X, then a year
<br>
later was absolutely sure of Y not X, then a year
<br>
later Z not X or Y'.
<br>
So be it. In this age, anyone who doesn't
<br>
radically revise their thinking every year or two
<br>
isn't keeping up.
