Phil and David, I find I agree with everything
<br>
you say here, except this last bit. When I think
<br>
of &quot;sentience&quot; I start with humans, but I am not
<br>
in a hurry to exclude the larger apes or the
<br>
whales, and I would consider any AI as smart as
<br>
us to be sentient even if it is very different.
<br>
<p>As for democracy, I have elsewhere noted that
<br>
political systems are based on the popular
<br>
science of the time they were invented, which is
<br>
to say thay they tend to be a generation or so
<br>
behind the cutting-edge science of the time. Marx
<br>
based his ideas on Darwin, among other things,
<br>
and produced a flawed system (communist societies
<br>
produce information bottlenecks at the top levels
<br>
of decision makers, and by centralizing power
<br>
they make dictatorships inevitable).
<br>
<p>American-style democracy was invented in the
<br>
mid-18th century, based on scientific ideas
<br>
existing prior to that, and likewise has
<br>
'security holes' which leave the door open to
<br>
various ills.
<br>
<p>I elsewhere proposed a new political model based
<br>
on a more modern understanding that any social
<br>
system is a form of software, and needs to be
<br>
debugged and proofed against 'hacking' such as
<br>
vote fraud and propagandization of the stupider
<br>
voters. I call it the Random Mandarin system, and
<br>
in essence calls for a 'jury pool' of candidates
<br>
who have passed intelligence and psychological
<br>
tests. (I am convinced that there are quite a few
<br>
sociopaths in high places who would be outed by
<br>
PET scans). From this pool office holders would
<br>
be chosen randomly. Elaborate measures would be
<br>
taken to ensure random choice of qualified
<br>
candidates, and tampering with the random choice
<br>
mechanism would be a very severe crime (more akin
<br>
to murder than petty theft; one of the real flaws
<br>
of our system is that assaults on the system's
<br>
integrity are treated like jaywalking when the
<br>
consequences can easily cost thousands of lives).
<br>
<p>However, such a system would be obviated by the
<br>
ascension of transhumans or SAI. That, plus the
<br>
fact that the powers-that-be would make sure it's
<br>
never adopted, is why I don't proselytize it a
<br>
lot harder.
