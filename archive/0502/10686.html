&nbsp;Ach, David, you drive me batty. I think you have
<br>
an elitist streak a yard wide. Nevertheless, I
<br>
too suspect the IQ's are widening, or to be more
<br>
specific, many people use their native
<br>
intelligence for utter trivia because they have
<br>
had the luxury of surviving on half a brain in a
<br>
rich country for half a century.
<br>
<p>I feel that the central thrust of a
<br>
demarchy/Random Mandarin system, from *my
<br>
viewpoint*, is not so much putting the paper boy
<br>
in the Oval Office, but simply throwing real
<br>
obstacles in front of thugs. Need I point out
<br>
that one of the most powerful men in the United
<br>
States government (Tom DeLay) is a former
<br>
exterminator who hated the government telling him
<br>
what he could and could not do with bug poison? A
<br>
real piece o' work, that fellow, and we're not
<br>
talking about a philosopher-king here.
<br>
Would you approve of a demarchic system more if
<br>
it were limited to a core of Mensa members,
<br>
CEO's, former Olympians, and other self-selected
<br>
overachievers? (This would be pretty close to
<br>
ancient Athens, and nobody can fault that system,
<br>
while it lasted).
<br>
<p>Heck, when you come right down to it, 90% of what
<br>
I want out of a random system could be achieved
<br>
by forcing all office holders to undergo PET
<br>
scans to weed out the neurologically abnormal
<br>
sociopaths. I feel in my bones that the ranks of
<br>
solons would be decimated! Those who remained
<br>
would still have all their usual flaws, but at
<br>
least they wouldn't be soulless lizards
<br>
pretending to give a fig about the future.
<br>
Have you ever known a real sociopath? I have, at
<br>
least once. K.W. was as smart as me, more or
<br>
less, and lived in the same house in Cambridge.
<br>
<em>&gt;From what I heard, he would sleep through classes
</em><br>
at Harvard and get perfect grades, although I
<br>
learned not to believe anything about him unless
<br>
I could verify it. He was said to be one of those
<br>
people who can play several games of chess at
<br>
once and win them all. He was a 'social activist'
<br>
but mainly seemed to work at surrounding himself
<br>
with admirers and playing chess with humans as
<br>
pieces. I recall a woman in the house starting
<br>
fights with me for no obvious reason. One day, as
<br>
I walked out of the kitchen with a freshly made
<br>
cup of tea, I saw her by a window weeping (Why?
<br>
Don't know; didn't ask). Not knowing what else to
<br>
do, I offered her the tea. She looked shocked,
<br>
and accepted it; she then told me this simple
<br>
gesture was totally incompatible with the tales
<br>
K.W. had been telling her about me. I think he
<br>
did that with everyone.
<br>
On a trip out west, K.W. would not let anyone
<br>
else drive. He apparently needed to prove he was
<br>
a superman. He fell asleep and his lover died in
<br>
the wreck. I recall being warned when the
<br>
survivors returned that K.W. was not to be
<br>
personally attacked for this, being in a  fragile
<br>
mental state due to his trauma and guilt! He had
<br>
suffered too much already.
<br>
<p>I suggest you worry too much about IQ and not
<br>
enough about motive. Knowing there are K.W.'s
<br>
making decisions about my life is, for me, like
<br>
knowing there's a pyromaniac in the apartment
<br>
downstairs.
