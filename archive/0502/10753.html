<p>You're talking rubbish, but you're not being too verbose :) That is,
<br>
while I disagree with the content of what you say, your style is fine;
<br>
please keep it up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most people here have probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; covered this before, but I still have to prove my grounds.
</em><br>
<p>The topic has been discussed before, though of course the list
<br>
archives are extensive and finding messages on a particular topic may
<br>
not be trivial; still, Google could probably dig some up for you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are four major ways to be frightened by AGI that come to mind now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ~ only one of which I think is worth worrying about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Skynet becomes self-aware and eats us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) AGI kills us all in our own best interests. How better to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world hunger?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) AGI needs our food, and out-competes us. Bummer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) AGI destroys our free will
</em><br>
<p>(I don't see any difference between 1 and 3, but you seem to, so I'll
<br>
address 3, which is the one on which we most strongly disagree.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am only worried about (1). I can imagine (3) happening, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object to it. Survival of the fittest is how I got here, and damned if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm going to starve to death for the sake of some rats. I think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair enough to apply the same standard to something smarter and higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the food chain.
</em><br>
<p>I used to think that too, until I thought about it a bit more clearly
<br>
and realized that the end point of evolution would not be sentient.
<br>
Let survival of the fittest run to its ultimate conclusion and you'll
<br>
have something that might be considered intelligent - at least, it'll
<br>
be better than any human at solving some types of engineering
<br>
problems, for example - but there will be nothing it will be like to
<br>
be that thing. There'll be a universe full of marvellously intricate,
<br>
optimally self-replicating nanomachinery - and nobody there to make
<br>
use of it.
<br>
<p>Still happy with that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * We should realise that evolution can be made to work for us by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building an AGI ecosystem, and thus forcing the AGI to survive only by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working for the common interest
</em><br>
<p>And the above is why doing things on this basis turns out to be such a
<br>
horribly bad idea.
