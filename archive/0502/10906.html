<em>&gt;&gt; I'm curious about the amount of theoretical progress SI has made since

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and LOGI in the areas of FAI and AI research.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; My thinking has changed dramatically.  I just don't know how to measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<p>You can measure progress by examining your existing knowledge on the subject
<br>
and comparing it to an expected knowledge sufficient enough for you to say:
<br>
&quot;Finally we can begin coding.&quot; If these two sets look more alike then
<br>
before, then I would call that a progress.
<br>
<p>I know what you're thinking. How does one develop a sense of knowledge
<br>
complete enough to start the implementation if one doesn't know exactly what
<br>
that final theory looks like? As someone who has been developing AI theory
<br>
for some time now, perhaps your experience with incomplete theories that
<br>
later become complete has taught you a sense of what it takes to build
<br>
theoretical frameworks that are not only necessary, but also sufficient. My
<br>
hunch is you might know what it takes to get from today to the
<br>
finish/starting line. I might be wrong, but, since I'm not a mind reader, I
<br>
can't know what you know until you tell me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Progress is not the same as visible progress.
</em><br>
<p>That's why I'm asking about the unpublished progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now that I have a better idea of what it means to understand something, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also understand a little better what it means to &quot;explain&quot; something, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's clear that my earlier explanations failed - people did not apply or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build on the knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>I'm a bit worried about this because, it seems, you're not getting much help
<br>
on the theoretical front which might delay the implementation indefinitely,
<br>
thereby increasing existential risk. I'm disappointed in myself and others
<br>
that this or other special purpose list still hasn't morphed into mainly a
<br>
theory-extending forum for discussing technical topics directly related to
<br>
SeedAI and Friendliness. It's just that the knowledge requirements to
<br>
contribute anything relevant to the existing theory appear so high that
<br>
there's hardly anyone who can meet them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So now I try to explain simpler things at greater length, for that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better to understand just one thing than to be confused by two dozen.
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; How far is SI currently from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the point at which its programmers can begin writing code?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How on Earth am I supposed to know this?
</em><br>
<p>By taking account of what you know vs. everything you need to know to write
<br>
code. If you're at the stage where you still don't know what you don't know
<br>
then, yes, your reaction is appropriate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope I am not to be penalized if, unlike other futurists, I know better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than to make stuff up.
</em><br>
<p>Well, at the very least you have the option of sending me your best
<br>
nonobligatory ass number (in whatever units you like) offlist so the
<br>
community won't hound you to death in case you don't make the predicted
<br>
deadline. :)
