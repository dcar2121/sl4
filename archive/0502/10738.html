<em>&gt; Yeah, I know this question sucks.
</em><br>
<p>No, it doesn't. It's fun to speculate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But I'm curious. Which do you think has the higher probability of coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into being first - real molecular nanotechnology or real artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle have proposed a $5 million 5-year project
<br>
whose &quot;goal is to describe a complete set of molecular tools/reactions,
<br>
validated using appropriate computational chemistry software,&quot; which &quot;would
<br>
provide a powerful basis for NNI and other funders to consider molecular
<br>
factories as worthy of mainstream funding.&quot; From what I understand, this
<br>
type of project is required to precede any future project centered around
<br>
creating real nanomachines.
<br>
<p>Even if a project of the type proposed by Freitas and Merkle starts in 5
<br>
years, they estimate it will take 5 more years to complete it. That's ten
<br>
years from now until real funding allows advanced MNT research possible,
<br>
which might take next 5-25 years. In total, real nanotech could happen in
<br>
15-35 years from now. BTW, I'm pulling the first 5 years and the last 5-25
<br>
years almost exclusively out of thin air.
<br>
<p>And there's Chris Phoenix from CRN who says that, given sufficient funding,
<br>
real MNT could happen in 10 years.
<br>
<p>Weighing this all in, plus other things which I didn't mention, my
<br>
optimistic guess at this time is that we should see real nanotech around
<br>
2027.
<br>
<p>I used to think that MNT was AI's enabling technology. The argument was that
<br>
*only* nanomachines could provide researchers with sufficiently detailed
<br>
structure of human brain which was *absolutely necessary* for computer
<br>
scientists to later emulate intelligent behavior inside a computer. I didn't
<br>
have much faith in cognitive science then.
<br>
<p>What enables AI is the knowledge about how intelligence works. Derivation of
<br>
that knowledge doesn't necessarily depend on a single technology. In theory,
<br>
then, it is possible to derive knowledge about intelligence without
<br>
resorting to MNT, which means that AI could happen well before MNT. It is
<br>
possible that a combination of direct and indirect techniques from cognitive
<br>
science could provide sufficient knowledge to learn how intelligence works.
<br>
Incidentally, Eliezer goes much further along this path by claiming that
<br>
there's already more than enough existing evidence in the field to infer the
<br>
correct structure of intelligence. I don't know how much confidence he
<br>
assigns to that statement, but when I asked him earlier this week if he
<br>
really thought intelligence was just an &quot;engineering&quot; problem for him, he
<br>
chose not to answer which suggests to me that he may not be as confident
<br>
about his knowledge of how intelligence works, as I thought he was. If you
<br>
contribute, or plan contributing, any money to his project, better hope he
<br>
was merely too bored to answer. :)
<br>
<p>Also, throwing massive amounts of computing power at the problem might
<br>
produce artificial intelligence. Since blind evolution created intelligence,
<br>
in theory, some evolutionary algorithm, powered by massive amounts of
<br>
computing power, could replicate similar feat inside a computer, i.e., if
<br>
one believes that a mind is a type of computer, and I do.
<br>
Considering such an evolutionary algorithm will almost certainly be simpler
<br>
to write than any intelligence-producing algorithm inspired by cognitive
<br>
science, it is possible that an evolutionary-produced-AI approach might
<br>
succeed well before other attempts at building real AI. One might argue that
<br>
evolutionary approach is currently scheduled to succeed sooner or later,
<br>
considering inexorable growth in computing power. In fact, I would like to
<br>
have this evolutionary approach to build AI officially declared as the most
<br>
dangerous existential threat to humankind today, just after the threats
<br>
posed by biological and nuclear weapons.
<br>
<p>Even though it is impossible to predict when AI and MNT will happen, we have
<br>
the ability to at least track which technologies *could* happen first or, in
<br>
other words, to estimate potential of a particular technology to happen
<br>
first in relation to other technologies. In my estimation, the potential of
<br>
AI to happen before MNT is greater than MNT's potential to happen before AI,
<br>
and I would like to illustrate this with an example:
<br>
<p>In order for MNT to happen, the researchers need tools to build more
<br>
complicated nanomachines. By the time that happens, the science will have
<br>
reached the ability to investigate molecular structures. At that point, even
<br>
though MNT should still have much more growing up to do before it could have
<br>
any impact on our world, cognitive science should immediately benefit from
<br>
techniques allowing study of matter at the molecular level. Cognitive
<br>
scientists could apply these techniques to copy, emulate and study
<br>
structures and mechanisms found in human brain in software, with the purpose
<br>
of filling all the missing gaps in maturing science of intelligence. AGI
<br>
researchers could use even partial, but growing, knowledge about
<br>
intelligence to build real AI well before cognitive scientists learn
<br>
*everything* about how human minds work.
<br>
<p>This is the most conservative scenario as for when AI should happen. This is
<br>
when AI should happen at the latest. The scenario completely ignores
<br>
advances in evolutionary approaches to AI, imaging technologies, cognitive
<br>
science, and more progress in AGI research, all of which could accelerate
<br>
the advent of real AI. Considering all this, technically, AI should happen
<br>
before MNT. However, a lack of funding for AI and research into safe AI
<br>
frameworks might delay real AI well past the MNT revolution.
