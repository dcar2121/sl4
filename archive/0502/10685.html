----- Original Message -----

From: &quot;Randall Randall&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:randall@randallsquared.com?Subject=Re:%20Ethics,%20IQ">randall@randallsquared.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What could you possibly mean by a statement about having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mental capacity to increase mental capacity?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that one could increase one's intelligence by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act of will, likewise, seems so obviously wrong that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to indicate that you and others on this list are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not using the term &quot;IQ&quot; to mean the same things.
</em><br>
<p>I have written a number of IQ tests and an IQ tests your knowledge and then
<br>
compares your score to others who are about the same age and educational
<br>
background.  This is not the best kind of test for intelligence but it is in
<br>
wide use.  My use of the word IQ is simply how intelligent a person is.  I
<br>
was not trying to split hairs over what IQ technically means or whether a
<br>
standard deviation of 50 was possible or not.  I took Phil's comment about
<br>
50 to just mean that the IQ's were separated by a lot.
<br>
<p>I *personally* believe that I increased my intelligence enormously by an
<br>
overt act of organization while I was a teenager.  Before grade 8, I was
<br>
considered quite average in intelligence and somewhat less than my fraternal
<br>
twin.  By grade 12, I was considered one of the smartest in the school and
<br>
much smarter than my twin.  When I went to University and studied Computer
<br>
Science I was considered one of the best in Computer Science even though
<br>
there were some photographic memory, very fast thinking students who were
<br>
definitely considered genius.  When looking at patterns and systems in
<br>
programming however, I often saw the forest instead of just the trees.  I
<br>
had better algorithmns and could program my solutions quicker than those
<br>
obvious geniuses.  There was no scientific study in my case but I can tell
<br>
you that I have report cards from grade 6 that said I might make it through
<br>
grade 12 if I worked hard enough.  I just finished my Computer Science
<br>
degree in 2001 (continued from 1978) and in my final year, my grade point
<br>
average was over 3.8 (4 would be straight A's) in Economics, Anthropology
<br>
and Computer Science while working full time.
<br>
<p>I think I could actually show the technique I used when I was a teenager to
<br>
accomplish this.  I was never considered to have an exceptional memory when
<br>
I was young but I remember the syntax of every computer language I have ever
<br>
programmed in.  Some of these languages I haven't seen since the 1970's and
<br>
I think I could be at full speed within the day.
<br>
<p>Your *obviously wrong* comment, I obviously disagree with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In any case, Phil's question is apparently predicated on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the assumption that there is some technology available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to perform the narrowing or boosting required, as is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nature of a thought experiment.
</em><br>
<p>I responded to emails that I read on the list.  Sometimes the topic changes
<br>
slightly while the subject title doesn't.  In one of my emails I said that I
<br>
was responding to his hypothetical case with real world replies because I
<br>
believed those comments were relavent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For everyone involved in this argument and others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently: Please make an effort to understand what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your opponents are trying to communicate.  Even where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with one side or the other of some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ongoing debates here, it's clear that you all spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of your time talking past each other rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussing differences of substance.
</em><br>
<p>I see you have made posts since August 17, 2000.  Does this mean that you
<br>
understand all arguments and that other *new comers* don't?  Even if Phil
<br>
was assuming some method of increasing or decreasing peoples IQ, my comments
<br>
would still stand.  Most people (in my experience) don't like or want to be
<br>
smart people.  When I discovered this, I was obviously shocked, such is the
<br>
bias of people who value intelligence.  If you gave them the choice to raise
<br>
their IQ 20 points, they would decline it.
<br>
<p>-- David Clark
