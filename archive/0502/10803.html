<p><em>&gt; &gt;- If we understand how charging interest for loans

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This one's difficult for me, since I see nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong in general with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one person offering and another person accepting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loan with interest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms.
</em><br>
<p>The Bible (Old Testament) forbids charging interest
<br>
for loans.  Curiously, while most OT laws are ignored
<br>
by Christians more often than by Jews, this law
<br>
was for many centuries followed by Christians but
<br>
ignored by Jews.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think that the cause of an action has any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bearing on whether or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not it's moral.  I do think understanding causes is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful when devising 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a response or corrective action.
</em><br>
<p>Then you are operating in the pre-12th-century notion
<br>
of morality, which said that the results of an action
<br>
determined its morality.  In this view, a rock that
<br>
rolls downhill and strikes someone is said to be
<br>
evil.  People in this time did in fact put animals
<br>
on trial for crimes.  After Abelard, we have
<br>
instead said that guilt in a crime must consider
<br>
the intent of the person.  This presumes free will,
<br>
and that guilt and morality require free will.
<br>
When we learn that a behavior was programmed into
<br>
someone by forces beyond their control, they are
<br>
operating like a rock and not like a moral agent.
<br>
But increasing knowledge of causes always diminishes
<br>
the scope of free will.  If we are materialists, we
<br>
may expect that there is no free will, and hence
<br>
no such thing as morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My thesis is that our understanding of morality is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergoing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maturation involving greater awareness, and that as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our awareness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continues to increase with time, so will our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you're seeing how problematic the
<br>
concept of &quot;morality&quot; is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Also, post-singularity, the human species may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rapidly diverge into a large number of species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;such that it is no longer feasible to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;moral relations between them.  So increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;knowledge may make the subjectivity of morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more obvious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we are moving toward a system of greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciation of local 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity, within a framework of shared principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on increasing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of what works and is therefore considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good.
</em><br>
<p>I think you're totally missing my point.  I appreciate
<br>
the diverse variety of insects outside my house.
<br>
But if they come inside, I kill 'em.
<br>
<p>- Phil
