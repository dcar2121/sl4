<p>No, that isn't what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is that
<br>
it seems unlikely that processing power can be increased
<br>
*by* processing, without action; by &quot;force of will&quot;, for
<br>
which &quot;having the will&quot; to do so is important.  To be
<br>
clear, my objection is with the idea that determination
<br>
is more important than things like diet, exercise, and
<br>
mind design.
<br>
<p>Laying aside the expectation that technology will be able
<br>
to increase intelligence through brain enhancement and
<br>
other methods, it seems clear that a human's intelligence
<br>
has a definite ceiling, above which no amount of good diet,
<br>
exercise, and practice will shatter.  This ceiling is
<br>
the concept to which I would expect people usually refer
<br>
when speaking of someone's &quot;IQ&quot; or &quot;raw intelligence&quot; or
<br>
&quot;g&quot;.
