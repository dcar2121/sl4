<p><em>&gt; Here hear!  An excellent defence of demarchy.  But what I find to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nicest thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the whole conception (besides stopping most corrupt political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games; and the fact that by sheer chance most decisions would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be made by lower and middle-class people, the ones who, y'know, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually have to live with the choices gov.'t makes, and are not able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to scoot off to the Bahamas or to gated communities) is the procedural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elegance of it.
</em><br>
<p>I can only hope that the *lower and middle-class people* look after just
<br>
Maru's money and life and not mine.  There is something worse than what we
<br>
now have and it can be found in the above paragraph.  Maru must believe that
<br>
evolution works best if you propagate the next generation from the worst,
<br>
rather than the best, current candidates.

<p><em>&gt; Also, bear in mind that any system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminates campaigns eliminates the de facto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bribery of campaign contributions, and frees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision makers from worrying that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscientious decision will cost them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-election.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, a more detailed description of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposal would include making sure the pool is of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who are qualified, or at least not stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not insane. If we need licenses to fly planes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or perform surgery, why not to govern?
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this point but is *non-insanity* or *non-stupidity* enough to
<br>
look after billions of dollars of public assets?  So why have elections at
<br>
all?  What qualified input or valuable opinion on almost anything are you
<br>
going to get by canvessing most people.  Most have either meaningless
<br>
unqualified opinions or simply don't care.  Who allows the *thugs* to
<br>
continue to govern right now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also obviate 'district shopping' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gerrymandering since a qualified person would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to move to an area dominated by like-minded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to have any chance of success.
</em><br>
<p>This is just another problem of the current democratic system, so why have
<br>
it at all?  Your solution seems to try to fix the myriad of problems with
<br>
the current voting system but doesn't do anything for the real problem which
<br>
is assigning value to valueless opinions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A random system would tend to eliminate 'winner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take all' phenomena where a slim majority can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steamroll a large minority. In a random system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the overall structure of policy making would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closely track the actual proportion of views in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the population.
</em><br>
<p>Why would the majority or minority views be a correct criteria for making
<br>
decisions?  Are the opinions of the majority necessarily in their or any
<br>
else's best interest?  Wouldn't it be better to have a certain set of goals
<br>
(call it a constitution) that is referred to in making decisions?  I have
<br>
read arguments on the SL4 list that say that truth/correctness can't be
<br>
voted on.  If something is true then it is true regardless of how many
<br>
people believe it.  This I agree with, although I don't always agree that
<br>
something is true when others do and some topics cannot be determined to be
<br>
either true or false but have weighted probabilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A random system can be seen not as a 'choosing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best' system but as a 'preventing the worst'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system.
</em><br>
<p>Democracy has been called a bad system but the best that humans have tried
<br>
so far.  I look at the way most companies, large and small, operate and most
<br>
of the time they make good decisions and work fairly well.  In general, they
<br>
have no elections and yet they seem to hire competent people at all
<br>
different levels.  The companies that don't make good decisions generally
<br>
fail, unless some 'do gooders' make the mistake of giving them some virtual
<br>
monopoly or public handout and wrecking the natural selection.  Why can't
<br>
any size organization (country, state, city, neighborhood etc) be run as a
<br>
huge hierarchy of organizations based on the kind of structure businesses
<br>
currently are?  Make the system automatically weed out the bad and
<br>
incompetent people and organizations and forget about voting all together.
<br>
The goal for most companies is to maximize profits but the goal for running
<br>
society should be to maximize collective value while maintaining individual
<br>
rights as set out in their constitutions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I do not expect the authoritarians to give up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power, legally or not, peacefully or not, and as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they now have surveillance and armament
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient to put down any opposition I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envision, I do not anticipate a random or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open-source system here. Only a transhuman or SAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can undo what has been done. Even then, it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily matter who 'should' impose hir
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions on the rest; it will only be a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of who can.
</em><br>
<p>This is a rather negative portrayal but I mostly agree with your point.
<br>
What if a small country, small island, small piece of some existing country,
<br>
moveable ocean platform etc could be had that didn't have these entrenched
<br>
power problems?  It might be possible.  There must be some rich people who
<br>
can't stand to live in the current political climate and want more than just
<br>
to be alone.  There must be a place sometime, somewhere where intelligent
<br>
and rational people can thrive.  Is just existing enough?
