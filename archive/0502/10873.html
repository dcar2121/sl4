That's right: I hope that 'lower and middle-class people', who have to 
<br>
live in this country, and who are not planning on defrauding me and 
<br>
absconding off to Switzerland, where of course they will be immune to 
<br>
prosecution because they can buy the best lawyers money can buy, will
<br>
make the decisions that affect folk just like them and me.
<br>
Imagine! Governance by my peers! Yes, truly it will be horrible- we all 
<br>
know ordinary people will make precisely the opposite decision which 
<br>
will be best for them.  We can only hope that our best and brightest, 
<br>
them who brought you Vietnam and the CIA, will stop this dastardly idea 
<br>
in its tracks.  Even better, they can censor our media, make sure 
<br>
ordinary people don't get any dangerous ideas, cause they know best 
<br>
right?  After all, capitalism is all about survival of the fittest, and 
<br>
by definition the rich are the ones best suited to make our decisions 
<br>
for us, right?  Right!  It's the average middle-class slob, who has no 
<br>
idea of the sacred right to pass humoungous fortunes to heirs, and 
<br>
pollute freely, to engage in the noble sport of tax evasion (the sport 
<br>
of kings! Well, CEOs anyway.) and enjoy all the finest things in life, 
<br>
who you have to watch out for.  Very dangerous.
<br>
<p>And how exactly does wealthy elites, gaming the system for their benefit 
<br>
'propagate the next generation.. from the best candidates'?
<br>
I'm dying to hear.
<br>
No wait, that's just soldiers and elderly people who are vulnerable to 
<br>
pollution.  Pardon my figure of speech.

Incidentally, most of that was sarcasm.  Just so you know.
