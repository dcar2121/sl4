<p><em>&gt;I'd like to get away from &quot;causes&quot;and &quot;reasons&quot; being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synomyous. I view reasons as relating to reasoning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and minds, aka Cognitive causation, whereas &quot;causes&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the superset of reason and mechanical causes.
</em><br>
<p>I don’t see the distinction. Minds are more complicated than Cuckoo
<br>
clocks but they both operate the way they do for a reason, there is a
<br>
cause; at least most of the time there is although sometimes they may do
<br>
something for no reason at all. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I disagree. Goals, reasons, cognitive causes are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far more maleable than mechanical causes. 
</em><br>
<p>Because when you’re dealing with minds things are far more complicated
<br>
than with clocks, but the principle is the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are a few differences besides their relation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to time which I attempted to articulate before. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes my present action can be caused by what I think the future will be
<br>
like and my prediction probably has a better than a 50% chance of being
<br>
correct too; but that is not unique to minds, a metrological computer
<br>
program can also make predictions that are sometimes correct. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the case of mechanical causation, two conflicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes balance each other out and nothing happens. 
</em><br>
<p>Not forever, eventually a random quantum fluxation will push one side or
<br>
the other down. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In cognitive causation, the mind/chooser is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to pretend as if one of the causes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never existed and to throw all his lot with one cause.  
</em><br>
<p>Not always, sometimes people can not make up their mind and are
<br>
paralyzed with indecision. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How in the heck does one decided if people are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for their actions and what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that decision based on? 
</em><br>
<p>It’s based on practicality.  You may be able to explain exactly why a
<br>
person becomes a monster, but that doesn't make them one bit less of a
<br>
monster. If a man is chasing me with a bloody ax I really don't care
<br>
what his motivation is, beautiful thoughts may be going on in his head
<br>
for all I know. He may be doing it because he had bad genes, or maybe he
<br>
had a bad environment, or maybe he’s doing it for no reason at all.  I
<br>
don't care, I just want somebody to put a bullet in his brain.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The assumption that the responsible individual is free. 
</em><br>
<p>I make no such assumption.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Elizier does say, in a somewhat biased, but fairly good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer, that free will is: &quot;a cognitive element 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representing the basic game-theoretical unit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral responsibility&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The above is true but a platitude, all it says is people are responsible
<br>
for their actions with a few five dollar words thrown in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Responsiblity&quot; does seem to be incredibly important.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, civilization would be imposable without it and that is exactly why
<br>
we hold people accountable for their actions, no need to invoke fuzzy
<br>
concepts like free will.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to say that non-mechanical causation is completley
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random is overly dismissive. 
</em><br>
<p>I don’t see why. “Everything happens for a reason OR not for a reason”
<br>
seems true non controversial and beyond dispute to me.
