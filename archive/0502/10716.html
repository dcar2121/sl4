</em><br>
<p>I was never absolutely sure, nor even close to absolutely sure.  I was 
<br>
raised a traditional rationalist - not a Bayesian, but still a traditional 
<br>
rationalist, wise in the art passed down from Feynman and Popper and Martin 
<br>
Gardner, though not the art of Jaynes and Tversky and Kahneman.  I was too 
<br>
traditionally humble to be absolutely certain of something (or, if I were 
<br>
certain, admit my certainty to myself), for that I knew it would not be 
<br>
rational to be certain.  I knew better than to assign a probability of 1.0, 
<br>
even without knowing *all* the probability theory and cognitive science 
<br>
behind the prohibition; I knew enough.  I was a *good* traditional 
<br>
rationalist, as traditional rationalists go.
<br>
<p>What I did *not* realize back then, and what the parables of traditional 
<br>
rationality did not teach me, is that being modest and humble and 
<br>
confessing your uncertainty isn't worth beans if you do it anyway and then 
<br>
you turn out to be wrong.
<br>
<p>So I went in search of a bigger hammer, a hammer with better discrimination 
<br>
and calibration; a sword that would not break in my hand; a method that 
<br>
would work, not just warn me that it might fail and then fail.
<br>
<p>It's frightening to me to contemplate that most AGI wannabes haven't even 
<br>
finished mastering traditional rationality; they reserve a part of their 
<br>
worldview for a mysterious magisterium and are cheerfully absolutely sure 
<br>
of the blatantly uncertain future.  And in a way this is not surprising, 
<br>
since the vast majority of modern-day human beings still have not mastered 
<br>
the traditions of traditional rationality.  But it is depressing, in 
<br>
someone who would hold the world in their hands, or for one who would 
<br>
aspire to be a maker of minds.  I was a damned fine traditional rationalist 
<br>
when I started out at age 16, though, as it turned out, too weak to 
<br>
actually obtain correct answers.  To actually obtain correct answers, not 
<br>
just be defensible in your failure, is an extraordinarily difficult thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So be it. In this age, anyone who doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically revise their thinking every year or two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't keeping up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tom Buckner
</em><br>
<p>Anyone who doesn't realize they might need to radically revise their 
<br>
thinking, and then needs to do so, isn't calibrated.
<br>
<p>Anyone who humbly disclaims that they might need to revise their thinking, 
<br>
behaves in more or less the same way regardless, and then needs to 
<br>
radically revise, makes a subtler mistake.
