<br>
| What do you mean by reproduce? If you mean creating a perfect

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
| the same thing as self-modification.
<br>
<p>Neither building a perfect clone nor building a new AGI are pointless,
<br>
or the same thing as self modification except in light of the end
<br>
goal. Consider : We are attempting to build Friendliness because we
<br>
wish humanity to be respected by AGI.
<br>
AGI will attempt to build Friendliness in AGI2 because it will wish to
<br>
be respected by AGI2.
<br>
<p>Thus, Friendliness becomes invariant so long as each parent maintains
<br>
a goal of self-existence.
<br>
<p>|&gt; * AGI will trigger a greap leap forward, and humans will become
<br>
|&gt; redundant. Intelligence is never the servant of goals, it is the
<br>
|&gt; master.
<br>
|
<br>
| Without an existing supergoal, by what measure do you compare
<br>
| potential goals, and how is this measure different from a
<br>
| supergoal?
<br>
<p>I believe that supergoals are not truly invariant. One does what all
<br>
minds do - develop from genetic origins, form supergoals from a
<br>
mixture of environment and heredity, and modify ones goals on the
<br>
basis of reflection. Morality is a faculty, not a property, and is
<br>
relative to context in all cases. The concept of an abstract invariant
<br>
Friendliness that is the same for all contexts is not trustably
<br>
attainable.
<br>
<p>Consider the personal case : Morality is a supergoal, will-to-life is
<br>
a supergoal, and maybe a few others. Yet we are easily able to
<br>
overcome or modify our supergoals through the construction of other
<br>
supergoals over time. Goal-creation is not always a unidirectional
<br>
thing. We exist in a state of looped feedback, not being merely
<br>
creatures subject to primal demands.
<br>
<p>|&gt; * In AGI, psychological instability will be the biggest problem,
<br>
|&gt; because it is a contradiction to say that any system can be
<br>
|&gt; complex enough to know itself.
<br>
|
<br>
| To know oneself, it is not necessary to contain oneself as a proper
<br>
| subset; it is enough to have a map of the high-level organization
<br>
| and be able to focus attention on one detail at a time.
<br>
<p>That is false: In a dynamic system variables not currently under
<br>
scrutiny are changing in unpredictable ways, thus the uncertainty
<br>
principle is maintained.
