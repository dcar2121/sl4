<p><em>&gt; So what if the human

</em><br>
<em>&gt; yeaaah!
</em><br>
<p>Current ethical systems are based on interactions
<br>
between agents with equal rights.  This will not work
<br>
when the agents have vastly dissimilar needs,
<br>
intelligences, and inclinations.  Imagine trying to
<br>
run a democracy in a population in which the
<br>
standard deviation of IQ was 50 points.  The smart
<br>
people actually making the decisions would not be
<br>
able to explain their reasons to the populace, and
<br>
would have to use deception and manipulation for
<br>
everything they did.  Democracy would be a joke.
<br>
Democracy would be evolutionarily unstable in
<br>
such an environment; a new power structure would
<br>
have to arise with unequal rights.
<br>
<p>Suppose that we widened the circle to include all
<br>
mammals.  We would not be able to build any new
<br>
buildings, because that would be taking habitat
<br>
from other animals.  We would have to stop using
<br>
cars, which kill many mammals.  We would have to
<br>
become vegans.  We would not be able to ride horses,
<br>
or keep dogs as pets, or even use seeing-eye dogs.
<br>
Our nation would immediately be bankrupted by the
<br>
popular vote to spend all our money on a public
<br>
handout of liv-a-snaps.  You get the picture.
<br>
That's the sort of society you're talking about.
<br>
The variety of transhumans could be as great as
<br>
the variety of mammals.
<br>
<p>The notion of &quot;sentience&quot;, when closely examined,
<br>
turns out to mean nothing other than &quot;human&quot;,
<br>
so it is not a useful qualification.
