Subject: Re: Ethics
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Current ethical systems are based on interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between agents with equal rights.  This will not work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the agents have vastly dissimilar needs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences, and inclinations.  Imagine trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run a democracy in a population in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard deviation of IQ was 50 points.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't this the case already?  Doesn't our population *already* have a
<br>
standard deviation of IQ of 50 points or more?  Don't the more intelligent
<br>
people already feel totally alienated from the current political climate and
<br>
the vast majority of other people?  Don't intelligent people already have
<br>
vastly dissimilar needs that are *not* currently being fulfilled?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people actually making the decisions would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to explain their reasons to the populace, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to use deception and manipulation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything they did.
</em><br>
<p>Deception and manipulation are already being used to get the masses to vote
<br>
and support most policies.  The only real problem is that the *smart people*
<br>
are not the one's making those decisions.  The current decision makers are
<br>
just bureaucratic robotic drones.  It definitely is a problem for the *smart
<br>
people* to live with and be judged by, other people who look at them and
<br>
their ideas as if they were alien creatures.  Current juries are not
<br>
intellectually capable of understanding most trials and when it comes to
<br>
scientific data, the judges aren't either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Democracy would be a joke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democracy would be evolutionarily unstable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such an environment; a new power structure would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to arise with unequal rights.
</em><br>
<p>Democracy is already a *joke*.  I totally agree that our current democracy
<br>
is and will become more unstable.  I also agree with the need for a new
<br>
power structure.  I know you are saying that these things will happen *if*
<br>
there is a large difference in intelligence but I would say that that is the
<br>
case already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose that we widened the circle to include all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammals.  We would not be able to build any new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buildings, because that would be taking habitat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from other animals.  We would have to stop using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cars, which kill many mammals.  We would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become vegans.  We would not be able to ride horses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or keep dogs as pets, or even use seeing-eye dogs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our nation would immediately be bankrupted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular vote to spend all our money on a public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handout of liv-a-snaps.  You get the picture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the sort of society you're talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The variety of transhumans could be as great as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the variety of mammals.
</em><br>
<p>I see no need to include animals in our ethical systems.  All creatures that
<br>
live, take space and resources that could be used to sustain other
<br>
creatures.  I don't want all the animals and plants on Earth to become
<br>
extinct but unless people will enforce a limit on the right of women to have
<br>
children then animals will, by necessity, come in second place.
<br>
<p>You put the &quot;nail on the head&quot; when you say that &quot;Our nation would
<br>
immediately be bankrupted by the popular vote to spend all our money on a
<br>
public handout&quot;.  Where everyone has a single vote to spend money that was
<br>
collected *not* equally, you have a system that cannot work in the long run.
<br>
Even if we are only talking about policies that don't involve money, most
<br>
people have no idea what the correct answer is.  In a democracy, there is no
<br>
weight given to more or less informed opinions.  The only thing that has
<br>
saved us so far is that the decisions have been relatively simple ones and
<br>
the masses have been willing to be lead down a path they wouldn't have
<br>
chosen on their own.  This situation will become more and more unstable as
<br>
we continue toward the singularity.
<br>
<p>Transhumans will not tolerate democracy (for everyone, even if they think it
<br>
ok for themselves) and most smart people today aren't satisfied with the
<br>
status quo either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The notion of &quot;sentience&quot;, when closely examined,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns out to mean nothing other than &quot;human&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so it is not a useful qualification.
</em><br>
<p>Totally true.  Why would an intelligent silcon based AI need to think or act
<br>
like a human to be considered &quot;a self aware independant entity&quot;.
<br>
