<p>You would think that for any finite goal there are
<br>
many more poor strategies than good ones.  And
<br>
similarly you would think that if you took some
<br>
particular sphere - art say - the set of bad music
<br>
should be at least as large as the set of good music. 
<br>
But something is highly fishy.  There is something
<br>
spectacularly odd going on.  I'm not so sure that the
<br>
set of things with some bad attribute is matching up
<br>
to the set of things with the corresponding good
<br>
attribute.  For instance if you took the set of all
<br>
'beautiful' things and that was infinite, you would
<br>
think that the set of all 'ugly' things should be
<br>
infinite as well.  But I'm not so sure that's the
<br>
case.  Or least the set of one might be a 'higher
<br>
order' infinity than the set of the other.
<br>
<p>I've recently become convinced that there are
<br>
objective values/morals/aesthetics that are really
<br>
just Bayesian reasoning 'tipped on it's side' so to
<br>
speak - or Bayesian reasoning rotated 90 degrees
<br>
through a metaphorical space.
<br>
<p>For instance reasoning can be described in terms of
<br>
two major techniques - Induction and Deduction. 
<br>
Similarly all of values/morals/aesthetics can be
<br>
described in terms of two major themes - Harmony and
<br>
Growth.  Now if you 'twist' Induction 90 degrees
<br>
through a metaphorical space you get one of the
<br>
central pillars of values - 'Harmony'.  Similarly
<br>
'twisting' Deduction yields the second central pillar
<br>
of values 'Growth'.  So Harmony and Growth are really
<br>
just Induction and Deduction rotated 90 degrees
<br>
through a metaphorical space.  And similarly all the
<br>
principles of reasoning have their analogies in the
<br>
world of values/morals/aesthetics.
<br>
<p>I'm closing in just what the 'transform' is that
<br>
converts Bayesian Reasoning to Objective Morality. 
<br>
I’m convinced that is some hugely spectacular idea
<br>
that I'm *almost* seeing but I just can't *quite* pin
<br>
it down.  As soon as I do... it's all over.
