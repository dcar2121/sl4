<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p>Interesting that you should ask.  At Cycorp, my recent presentation on a 
<br>
behavior engine for Cyc described Cyc Behavior Language, a new AI 
<br>
procedural language rooted in the Cyc event vocabulary.  CBL is 
<br>
specialized for creating James Albus-style nodes in a hierarchical 
<br>
task/perception network. However, my senior manager criticized the need 
<br>
for yet another new language, as we already program in SubL (a lisp 
<br>
dialect) and java for applications.  I was challenged to find a way not 
<br>
to need a new computer language when authoring intelligent behaviors for 
<br>
Cyc.
<br>
<p>You may know that automatic programming, program synthesis, program 
<br>
refinement, aspect-oriented programming, and most recently generative 
<br>
programming (see <a href="http://www.generative-programming.org">http://www.generative-programming.org</a> ) are fields of 
<br>
study about programs creating programs.  After a survey, I began  
<br>
developing a way to create Cyc Behavior Language deductively by 
<br>
factoring out every syntactic and semantic feature of the language along 
<br>
the dimensions of domain, application, and problem-solving methods.  My 
<br>
goal is to create a minimal number of Cyc Behavior Language routines 
<br>
that deduce general program structure top-down (like a hierarchical task 
<br>
network planner), then via many cross-cutting features, fill in the 
<br>
domain, application and problem-solving method details.  
<br>
While Aspect-oriented programming does this tailoring at compilation or 
<br>
runtime, in contrast my idea employs the techniques of generative 
<br>
programming to do this at program composition (authoring) time.  The 
<br>
advantage of using Cyc for this effort is that the knowledge base 
<br>
provides a rich vocabulary for describing features, which I will 
<br>
specialize for the features of Cyc Behavior Language, and I can easily 
<br>
bottom out the composition routines in KB asks (first order queries).  
<br>
<p>Although this work is just beginning, and it is an extra-effort activity 
<br>
among my sponsored tasks, I aspire to complete a bootstrap by year end 
<br>
2005.  By bootstrap I mean a full characterization of the composition 
<br>
routines as generative features, so that the composition routines 
<br>
themselves can be automatically composed from domain, application, and 
<br>
problem-solving method requirements, constraints and preferences that are 
<br>
declaratively stated in the Cyc knowledge base.  One can imagine a likely 
<br>
elaboration in which Cyc dialog enables a developer to incrementally 
<br>
prototype and refine a Cyc application implemented by the Cyc behavior 
<br>
engine.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
-Steve
