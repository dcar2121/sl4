It may take too much time to explain your current thoughts, but hinting at
<br>
them as Michael Wilson's wiki book reviews have done may satisfy some of the
<br>
curiosity and may allow people to point out other relevant work that has
<br>
been done in the same area. Perhaps you could let other people do the
<br>
editing of your rough drafts and release the results if you find them

acceptable?
