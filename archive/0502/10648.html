</em><br>
<p>May be, but I think it's a waste of time to speculate
<br>
on that (not to mention the fact that you'll probably
<br>
come to the attention of the CIA if you go on about it
<br>
too much).  Best leave it to the transhumans.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that we widened the circle to include all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammals.  We would not be able to build any new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buildings, because that would be taking habitat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from other animals.  We would have to stop using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cars, which kill many mammals.  We would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become vegans.  We would not be able to ride horses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or keep dogs as pets, or even use seeing-eye dogs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our nation would immediately be bankrupted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popular vote to spend all our money on a public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handout of liv-a-snaps.  You get the picture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the sort of society you're talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The variety of transhumans could be as great as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the variety of mammals.
</em><br>
<p>Rights are not all or nothing.  There are *degrees* of
<br>
rights.  We can broaden the circle to include all
<br>
mammals without granting them the same degree of
<br>
rights that we grant to people.  Read up on
<br>
'Personhood' ethics (which is probably the most
<br>
popualr ethical system among transhumanists).  The
<br>
idea is we assign rights based on the *degree* of
<br>
sentience present.  So entities get rights based on
<br>
their degree of cognitive abilities.  So is not
<br>
actually that much different to what happens now: 
<br>
small children for instance, have *some* rights, but
<br>
not the same *degree* of rights that adults have.  For
<br>
instance small children can't drive, own a gun, vote
<br>
etc.  But as their cognitive abilities improve, they
<br>
are gradually given more and more rights.
<br>
<p>So so it would be with a transhuman society.  It is
<br>
not the case that humans would *lose* any rights.  it
<br>
is simply the case that the transhumans would have
<br>
*more* rights.  But hopefully, they would offer all of
<br>
us the opportunaty to upgrade ourselves, then we could
<br>
choose to take on these extra rights (just like
<br>
children get to take on adult rights when they grow
<br>
up).
