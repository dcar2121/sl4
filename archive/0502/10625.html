<em>&gt;&gt;the scope of free will.  If we are materialists, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;may expect that there is no free will, and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;no such thing as morality.
</em><br>
<p>I have come to a temporarily final conclusion about this topic. Just as in 
<br>
my posts about qualia, I think you have to make a distinction between first 
<br>
person and third person. In my view, these perspectives are not just 
<br>
different ways of looking at the same thing but entirely different 
<br>
realities. This dualism seems to be one of the basic features of the 
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>Just like qualia represent not just &quot;another way of looking at neural 
<br>
computation&quot;, but a different phenomenon altogether, so does free will 
<br>
represent not just &quot;another way of looking at our set of heuristics to guide 
<br>
us through possible alternatives&quot;, but in the first person it assumes a 
<br>
different shape, it creates the quale you experience when you are deciding 
<br>
something, and the overall experience we refer to when talking about free 
<br>
will.
<br>
<p>So in the third person free will does not exist, but this does not prevent 
<br>
_us_ from having it because we don't live in the physical universe but in a 
<br>
simulated VR inside our skull. Another way to put it is, we _are_ the neural 
<br>
processes which (causally, deterministically and perhaps partly randomly) 
<br>
result in us making a decision. You cannot say &quot;this process is happening 
<br>
deterministically and I have no control over it&quot; when you _are_ the process 
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>It is this topological oddity of &quot;being&quot; a process that reconciles third and 
<br>
first person interpretations (although, as I said, to me these two are more 
<br>
than just different interpretations, they are two loosely related but 
<br>
separate ontologies).
