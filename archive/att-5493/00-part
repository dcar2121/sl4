Sergei S Markoff, author of SmarThink (chess program) just updated his
program.  Changes include:

- attack-extensions on pre-leaf nodes added;
- new search-extensions mechanism called "controlled singularity" added;
Eliezer and others might want to have a chat with him for a few hints. 
Or maybe just wait for the effects to hit, although, if it is
controlled, someone might have turned the speed dial right down.
