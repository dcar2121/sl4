Wild Guess:

Would it be more accurate to say, perhaps, that your
parents are somehow so connected with their religious
culture(not believes), that they simply ignore the thoughts
on the implausibility between evolution and the old
testment ?

Yes, my parents are observant Orthodox Jewish sci-fi fans, who know that the
Earth is 4.55 gigayears old and that human biology is the result of
evolution,
and who see no logical conflict between this and the Old Testament, which
they
believe to be literally and factually true.  To say that "they just don't
think about it" would be understating the complexity of the issue; it would
be
a better approximation to say that they focus on surface inconsistencies and
resolve them using various sleights-of-hand, and that this appearance of
activity substitutes for dealing with the fundamental inconsistency and
creates a plausible illusion that all issues have been resolved.

Incidentally, this describes people other than my parents.
