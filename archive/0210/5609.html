<p>
Reason,
<br>
<p>In order to answer to your question:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's the mechanism by which the big brain obtains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information on what the wishes of the little brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are without contaminating the little brain by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requesting information or passively making information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available to let the little brain know it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulating wishes?
</em><br>
<p>... I need to explain a viewpoint...  My ~take~ on Eliezer's phrasing: 'what you
<br>
are doing ceases to be &quot;argument&quot; and becomes &quot;mind control&quot;' has been to draw
<br>
an analogy of &quot;transhuman convincing PD human&quot; being like &quot;PD human convincing
<br>
dog&quot; (PD =  Present Day).  A PD human can model a dog's &quot;mind&quot; sufficiently well
<br>
to convince it to do almost anything willingly, given a little time.  The same
<br>
would be true of a transhuman and a PD human, except more so.  The subjects,
<br>
both dog and PD human, may know very well that they are being pursuaded of
<br>
something, but will happily go along with it, when presented with a sufficiently
<br>
good argument, or reason, or incentive.  We currently cannot read a dog's mind,
<br>
but we nevertheless can control its mind, to a non-trivial extent.  Therefore,
<br>
getting around to answering your question, a transhuman may not need to know
<br>
one-whole-heck of a lot about a particular human, or even question them in a
<br>
direct fashion, to figure out what thier wishes are (to a non-trivial extent).
<br>
On the other hand a transhuman could just 'read' the information directly from
<br>
the PD human's brain using advanced non-invasive analytical tools, without any
<br>
conversational interaction at all.
<br>
<p>And IRT your:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see a level at which any minimal conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or interaction to determine wishes is not mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control of those wishes (in some way meaningful to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the big brain) if you define mind control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (advertantly or otherwise) as you did in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous e-mail.
</em><br>
<p>I believe you are (or will be) entirely correct in this opinion.  Any
<br>
interaction of an advanced transhuman with a PD human could easily involve
<br>
extensive, detailed modelling of that human, and might intrinsicly include a
<br>
correspondingly high level of &quot;mind control&quot; or &quot;manipulation&quot; (or whatever will
<br>
be the latest jargon of that time) unless the transhuman makes meticulous
<br>
efforts to avoid it.  Once one comes to believe that this will be the case, the
<br>
importance of Friendliness in a transhuman AI becomes overwhelmingly apparent.
