You're sidestepping the issue a bit, but I'll try to be clearer.
<br>
<p>At 10:35 PM 10/19/2002 -0700, you wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;&lt;clip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am not at all a suicidal person.
</em><br>
<p>That's nice to hear. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   However, some claim that I owe other people continuing to live even if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find no happiness in it would be enough to put many over the edge.
</em><br>
<p>There was no mention of &quot;no happiness.&quot;  But... if you are arguing that 
<br>
suicide is a natural right in the case of life with &quot;no happiness&quot;, then 
<br>
I'd say that you have a natural right to pursue happiness, but ending your 
<br>
life is not a rational way of attaining happiness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   That is about the most vicious collectivist statement I have seen in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some time.
</em><br>
<p>Is that good or bad?  I'm confused.  (on one hand, it doesn't seem that bad 
<br>
to me, so maybe you're saying that collectivistims isn't that bad 
<br>
either...  but that seems to contradict the tone of your message.  hmmm)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I don't live for others to draw value from me.  I live because living 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself is of value to me.  I contribute out of strength, joy and wanting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make a difference.  I don't do so because I am enslaved by some &quot;duty&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to others.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, that's fine for you...  you're not suicidal.  You have a reason to live 
<br>
that is greater than your &quot;duty to others&quot;.  That's how it should be.  But 
<br>
what about people who are suicidal?  How does terminating ones life give 
<br>
them more freedom or happiness? You should have the right to do with your 
<br>
life what you want SHORT OF interfering with other people's rights to do 
<br>
what they want AND ending your own life.  Your duty to others does not 
<br>
enslave you, it frees you to continue living, to continue pursuing happiness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Seeing it as duty where even such a personal and fundamental decision 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as whether to live or die is determined by the collective is a very dark 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to look at life and the world.
</em><br>
<p>That's just it.  Suicide isn't only personal.  It affects the people around 
<br>
you, usually negatively.  Oh, and I never suggested that the collective 
<br>
should decide when you die.  We're not talking about murder here... it's 
<br>
more like anti-murder.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;- samantha
</em><br>
<p>I just want to make it clear.  I'm not saying that suicide is definitely 
<br>
not a natural right, just that I doubt that it is.  I have tried to provide 
<br>
some examples of why I see it as unnatural.  I'm not even sure that there 
<br>
is such a thing as a &quot;natural right&quot;, but I didn't want my silence to be 
<br>
taken as agreement with the statement that I quoted in my original 
<br>
post.  Please don't take my future silence on this topic as 
<br>
agreement.  I'll be in the chat room frequently to discuss this further.
<br>
