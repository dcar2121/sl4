</em><br>
<p>That is a question I will be very much interested to observe the AI contemplate.
<br>
<p>I currently have a strong leaning towards the notion of 'non-violation of
<br>
volition' on this question.  But, considering the issues raised in this thread,
<br>
the determination of what exactly it means to violate volition does not appear
<br>
to be clear-cut.  The intellectual capabilities of an AI sub-agent charged with
<br>
communicating with PD humans may have to be limited so that 'pursuasion' does
<br>
not become 'force' by default, due to greater intelligence.  I intuit that there
<br>
*is* a Friendly way to execute communication such that 'most but not all' PD
<br>
humans will be pursuaded not to die.  But, if someone really does want to die,
<br>
and they understand (and believe) that other options to pain/death now exist,
<br>
then they should be allowed to die.  A Friendly Singularity is about expanding
<br>
people's freedoms and options.  I see no reason why this particular option,
<br>
self-termination, should be omitted from a future list of freedoms.
<br>
<p>I don't want to give *any* freedoms up that I currently have.  Although I am
<br>
willing to discuss a trade of freedom for increased options in other areas.  I
<br>
currently have the ability to self-terminate.  That seems like 'biggie'.  Why
<br>
would I want to give that up?
