<p><p>Ah, perhaps the problem is that I spent the last week moving cross country, and am 
<br>
now involved with things like house-hunting and evaluating possible schools for the 
<br>
kids.   Since I'm not sitting at the computer all day like usual, I haven't been inspired 
<br>
to send out my usual raft of e-mails.  
<br>
<p>But it's gratifying to my petty human brain to see that SL4 just dwindles without me 
<br>
;-)  [Yes, I know, that's an unjustified statistical conclusion... but indulge me please 
<br>
;-&gt; ... I'm applying the Bayesian Probability Theorem without proper attention to the 
<br>
&quot;weight of evidence&quot; involved!!]
<br>
<p>I have relocated from beautiful rural New Mexico back to the US East Coast, where 
<br>
the Novamente-related business opportunities are better...  (and where my 
<br>
extended family lives, so my kids will be near their grandparents again...)
<br>
<p>On the drive out I had the opportunity to briefly visit a list member I'd never met 
<br>
before, Moshe Looks (who is also a part-time member of the Novamente team).   
<br>
We had a great evening's chat.  It was scary to realize he was much closer to my 
<br>
oldest son's age than to my own!!  Damn, this *aging* phenomenon has really got to 
<br>
be halted *soon* ...  !!
<br>
<p>However, yesterday I made myself quite unpopular at the life care center where my 
<br>
grandfather lives, offering to give a lecture on cryonics in their seminar series.  
<br>
Peculiarly enough (to me), none of these very old folks are interested in preserving 
<br>
themselves for future rejuvenation.  My wife and my parents feel the same way, 
<br>
though my kids don't -- they feel like me, they don't want to die, ever, if it can be 
<br>
avoided.   
<br>
<p>People have a very deep acceptance of death, which I have not fully 
<br>
psychologically come to terms with.  It seems to come about during adulthood, not 
<br>
childhood, perhaps triggered by post-teenage physiological changes....  Freud 
<br>
overstated things with his &quot;death wish&quot; but there was perhaps some kernel of truth 
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>As my father says &quot;I'm not all that important.  Why do I need to be preserved 
<br>
forever?&quot;   I can sympathize with that -- none of us are all that important, in a way.  
<br>
If we die, we will be replaced with others....   And as I've noted before, I feel that 
<br>
even if I do survive death, once I transform my mind into something superhuman 
<br>
and superintelligent, I probably won't be &quot;myself&quot; anymore in any real sense.
<br>
<p>But still there's so much curiousity in me about what comes next -- that, rather than 
<br>
any fear of death or sense of importance that I survive, is what mainly  makes me 
<br>
crave not to disappear like my human predecessors always have...
<br>
<p>By the way -- just to give you some substantive content -- I have been reading this 
<br>
book
<br>
www.allheart.com/3805566670.html 
<br>
Basic Cancer Programs: Genes, Signals, Metabolites: Unified Holistic Theory 
<br>
of Evolution
<br>
which is very interesting.  I'll post a review on it in a couple weeks, when I get 
<br>
the time.  Not just about cancer, the first half of the book gives a deep, 
<br>
speculative and fascinating rethinking of the nature of evolution by natural 
<br>
selection, using symbiogenesis as the key concept.  If any of you are really 
<br>
ambitious, you can order it and read it now so you can understand my review 
<br>
and comments fully when I post them!!  There are also implications for anti-
<br>
aging if his theory is correct.  And I don't know if it's correct, but I think I 
<br>
know how to test it using microarray-derived gene expression time series...
<br>
OK ... please forgive the somewhat rambling e-mail which does not advance 
<br>
the store of human knowledge particularly far... but hey... ;)
<br>
later,
<br>
ben
