<p>I think that you're thinking about Friendliness the wrong way.
<br>
<p>Friendliness allows an FAI the ability to find morality.  And not just 
<br>
any morality, but the correct morality.  And if there is no correct 
<br>
morality, then it will figure that out, too.  Most of your post 
<br>
discusses volition-based morality, not volition-based Friendliness (I'm 
<br>
not even clear on what volition-based Friendliness is supposed to 
<br>
be--your own version of Friendliness?).
<br>
<p>Volition-based morality is a theory that a human named Eliezer S. 
<br>
Yudkowsky has proposed as being closer to correctness than, say, 
<br>
Christian morality.  Humans, though, have too limited a mental capacity 
<br>
to check the correctness of a moral theory, so an FAI's initial moral 
<br>
theory (if one is given to the AI) is irrelevant because all known 
<br>
theories are equally likely to be wrong.
<br>
<p>There is nothing wrong with discussing morality; you need some system 
<br>
by which to decide what is right and wrong.  Otherwise you think that 
<br>
everything is right or, less often seen, everything is wrong.  
<br>
Discussing the morality of an SIFAI is silliness, though.  Beyond the 
<br>
level of human level AI, all you can do is make guesses.  Some guesses 
<br>
may turn out to be better than others, but they're still all just 
<br>
guesses.
