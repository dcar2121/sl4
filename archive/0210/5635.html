The cost of processing power continues to drop at
<br>
a Moore's Law pace.  Cost has dropped 10%
<br>
in the past two months and by 60%
<br>
in the past 11 months.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I've been tracking the cost of a node in
<br>
a Beowulf-type cluster of commodity computers, where
<br>
the memory is kept at a ratio of 1 byte/flop/sec,
<br>
and storage is 100 bytes/flop/sec.  The best
<br>
cost/performance nodes I have found are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Date    $/Gflop/s
<br>
Nov 01  600
<br>
Jan 02  437
<br>
Mar 02  397
<br>
May 02  319
<br>
Aug 02  272
<br>

<br>
Component prices are obtained from pricewatch.com,
<br>
including shipping but not sales tax.  Current
<br>
configuration is as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Case:       $23  Generic Mid-ATX w/300W power supply
<br>
Motherboard: 35  FIC AZ-31
<br>
CPU:         37  AMD Duron 1.3GHz
<br>
Memory:      81  3x512MB PC133 SDRAM
<br>
Storage:    161  2x80GB EIDE internal Hard Disk
<br>
Networking: 100  4 NICs/node, wiring, hubs
<br>
<p>Total      $437/node
<br>
<p>AMD processors when used efficiently perform 1.375
<br>
Flop/Hz (3 FPUs @ 2 cycles per calculation -
<br>
overhead), which makes the calculation:
<br>
<p>$437 / (1.3 GHz * 1.375 Flop/Hz) = $244/Gflop/s
<br>
<p>If optimistic estimates of the required computer
<br>
power for human-level AI are correct at 100 TFlop/s,
<br>
it presently costs $24.4M to buy a human's worth
<br>
of computers.  Note that the Red Storm supercomputer
<br>
announced yesterday will have a much higher unit
<br>
cost: $90M for 40 TFlops.   
<br>
<p>I have estimated an 'economic
<br>
crossover' of $3M for 100 TFlop/s when computers
<br>
become generally cheaper than humans.  This is
<br>
based on a computer being able to put in 5x as
<br>
many productive hours as an average human, a 5 year
<br>
payback time on the hardware, and $120K as the total
<br>
cost per year of a technical professional.  We are
<br>
therefore about 3.0 doublings in performance/$
<br>
away from economic crossover.  At the ~annual trend
<br>
of cost reduction, 60% per 11 months, that would be
<br>
reached in 25 months, or late 2004.  At the more
<br>
recent trend of about 5% per month, it would be
<br>
reached in 39 months, or early 2006.
<br>
<p>Economic crossover is not implying we would have 
<br>
human-level AI at that point, but rather that
<br>
skilled human tasks which require lots of processing
<br>
power would be cost-feasible.  In particular, high
<br>
level factory automation should be possible. This
<br>
has implications in the social and economic realms.
<br>
<p>The processing power to run a human-level AI is
<br>
unknown, but is estimated to be in the range of
<br>
100 - 100,000 TFlop/s. Assume the most powerful
<br>
machine available for AI work is in the $3 M price
<br>
range.  Then the expected date of a human-level
<br>
machine is 2006-2019.  The expected date for
<br>
superintelligent machines is 6.5 years later.  This
<br>
is calculated from a human taking about 20 years
<br>
to train.  A machine 8 times faster than a human
<br>
is expected 4 years after a human-equivalent, and
<br>
it would be expected to train in 20/8 = 2.5 years.
<br>
<p>Once superintelligent machines are available, the
<br>
time constant for doubling performance may drop to
<br>
much shorter periods as superintelligent machines
<br>
design their successors ever more rapidly.  This
<br>
singularity may occur in the 2012-2025 time period.
<br>
<p>Trends in labor productivity also point to a
<br>
singularity
<br>
in the ~2020 time period.  The trend indicates labor
<br>
input will fall to zero about that time, i.e. fully
<br>
automated production.  The cost of any given product
<br>
should then be much lower than today.
