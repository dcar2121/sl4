<p>
Aaron,
<br>
<p>Your opinion, that I have a &quot;duty to others&quot; to go on living, is anathema to me.
<br>
I will defend my &quot;right to die&quot; down to my last partical of resource.  Not
<br>
because I particularly want to die, but because I reject the idea that the
<br>
collective posseses the moral authority to determine my future.  I can and will
<br>
determine my own future, thank you very much!  I have no duties to others,
<br>
except those duties that I admit/take-on/assume.  I do not acknowledge duties
<br>
that are imposed upon me as having any moral weight whatsoever.
<br>
<p>I also 'just want to make it clear' that to *impose* a duty to continue living
<br>
is a clear violation of volition, and, as such, a very unFriendly action.
<br>
<p>That said, I do understand where you're coming from.  In a society where
<br>
scarcity is the rule, the question of an individual's continued existence or
<br>
termination is non-trivially relavent to the group.  Resources are still scarce
<br>
IMO, but not as scarce as they once were, for many.  Certainly not scarce enough
<br>
that you or I offing ourselves is going to make any difference to anything.  In
<br>
a society of abundance, the self-termination of an individual will not effect
<br>
the group's ability to survive to any meaninful extent.  It is time to re-write
<br>
that part of the EP programming.
<br>
