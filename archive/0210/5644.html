<em>&gt; That's nice to hear. :)

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   However, some claim that I owe other people continuing to live even

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was no mention of &quot;no happiness.&quot;  But... if you are arguing that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide is a natural right in the case of life with &quot;no happiness&quot;, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say that you have a natural right to pursue happiness, but ending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your life is not a rational way of attaining happiness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I will not fall into a debate about what a &quot;natural right&quot; is. 
<br>
But I can hardly find something that is more the business of the 
<br>
individual than the very personal decision whether their life 
<br>
brings enough hope, or happiness or is too full of negatives to 
<br>
wish to go on.  Is it rational to go on if you become convinced 
<br>
that there is no reasonable hope or if your world is hell?   I 
<br>
would not dare claim I can answer that question for other people 
<br>
or in general.  I can only answer it for myself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;   That is about the most vicious collectivist statement I have seen in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is that good or bad?  I'm confused.  (on one hand, it doesn't seem that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad to me, so maybe you're saying that collectivistims isn't that bad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either...  but that seems to contradict the tone of your message.  hmmm)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Saying that human beings owe the collective so deeply that they 
<br>
should continue to live regardless of their own feelings, 
<br>
perceptions and experiences is certainly not ambiguous.  It is a 
<br>
very bad notion of duty binding human beings as effective slaves 
<br>
to the collective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;   I don't live for others to draw value from me.  I live because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; living itself is of value to me.  I contribute out of strength, joy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and wanting to make a difference.  I don't do so because I am enslaved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by some &quot;duty&quot; to others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, that's fine for you...  you're not suicidal.  You have a reason to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live that is greater than your &quot;duty to others&quot;.  That's how it should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be.  But what about people who are suicidal?  
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I was suicidal when I was young - very much so.  It 
<br>
was the realization that I did have a choice and what that 
<br>
choice implied that took me beyond being suicidal.  Prohibiting 
<br>
the choice will not encourage people to find their own deep 
<br>
appreciation of life and dedication to a life that has meaning 
<br>
to them.  It is mroe likely to cheapen life and the process of 
<br>
such profound and fundamental choosing.
<br>
<p>Is  your point about what will keep the suicidal person alive or 
<br>
about the suicidal person's right to choose life or death for 
<br>
themselves?  As a conversation about rights I don't believe it 
<br>
is justified to claim that it might inconvenience the group and 
<br>
therefore the individual does not have the right to decide this 
<br>
and act on their decision.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How does terminating ones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life give them more freedom or happiness? 
</em><br>
<p>Most suicides terminate to finally end their real and/or 
<br>
perceived pain and suffering, not to acquire more freedom and 
<br>
happiness.  So you seem to be asking the wrong question.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You should have the right to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do with your life what you want SHORT OF interfering with other people's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights to do what they want AND ending your own life.  
</em><br>
<p>You are asserting baldly that we don't have the right to end our 
<br>
own life?  Am I reading you correctly?  If I don't have such a 
<br>
right then what exactly do I have?  Why this great exception in 
<br>
my right to my own life?  If the decision to live, with all that 
<br>
implies, or to die is not in my hands then what is?  And what 
<br>
exactly empowers you to say what people do and do not have a 
<br>
right to anyway?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Your duty to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others does not enslave you, it frees you to continue living, to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue pursuing happiness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Denial of choice is never about freedom.  What if someone is 
<br>
simply sick of &quot;pursuing happiness&quot; or has no more they can gain 
<br>
as far as they can see?  What of someone suffering from a 
<br>
terminal disease and in excruciating, unending, mind-eating 
<br>
pain?  Would you deny even them the right to simply say &quot;ENOUGH&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;   Seeing it as duty where even such a personal and fundamental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; decision as whether to live or die is determined by the collective is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a very dark way to look at life and the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's just it.  Suicide isn't only personal.  It affects the people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around you, usually negatively.  Oh, and I never suggested that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collective should decide when you die.  We're not talking about murder 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here... it's more like anti-murder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It is one of the most personal things there is.  The choice to 
<br>
live, taken fully consciously and followed in its implications 
<br>
ceaselessly, rather than just defaulting to being biologically 
<br>
alive or being  duty-bound to such &quot;life&quot;, is far too precious 
<br>
and important to glibly force a pale semblance. If I cannot 
<br>
choose death then I cannot choose life.  I am choiceless in the 
<br>
matter.
