<em>&gt; &gt; Also, I suggest you (Gordon) adopt a less cocksure
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is almost always good advice (Gordon! ;), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not always.  If you're right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're right.  There is no point softening it, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just wastes time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicates discussion.
</em><br>
<p>Soft is good. Our perceptions do not reflect reality
<br>
%100. Our language is imprecise. We have emotions
<br>
which we did not choose to have; we do not react only
<br>
to the content of a message, rather to both the
<br>
content and the style. Therefore there is a point to
<br>
softening styles of speech, as well as styles of
<br>
cognition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As in when seeing a seeming error on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another's part, trying to see what they really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; instead of assuming they are simply incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is poor advice.  One should judge posters on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they actually post, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you *think* they posted, or what they *seemed*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to post.
</em><br>
<p>One shouldn't judge posters at all, one should just
<br>
strive try to clarify views and improve understanding.
<br>
Such as &quot;if you meant what you seem to have meant, X,&quot;
<br>
(statement X in as clear terms as Responder can
<br>
manage), &quot; then this seems to me incorrect, for the
<br>
following reasons...&quot;.
