<em>&gt; &gt; Still, as a first shot, and clearly understanding that it needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; refinement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1) A person is free when that person is making a choice among several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perceived plausible choices, and also feels that not choosing would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; valid choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2) There are degrees of freedom.  It's not an either / or state.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are no infinities and no zeros.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3) If only one of the choices perceived as available is also perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as desireable, the amount of freedom present is minor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4) If none of the choices presented as available are also perceived as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desireable, the person has less freedom than under condition 3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5) If no difference in the desirability of the choices available is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discernable, but the choices are perceived as essentially different,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then the freedom approaches the maximum possible, and increases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; direct proportion to the number of perceived choices.
</em><br>
<p>One interesting thing about this notion of &quot;freedom&quot; is that it defines
<br>
freedom purely as a subjective feeling.  It's all about what is subjective
<br>
perceived as plausible, valid, desirable, different, etc.
<br>
<p>This means that in principle, one could have two minds, each carrying out
<br>
largely the same cognitive processes, but with mind A considering its
<br>
choices as &quot;free&quot; and mind B not.
<br>
<p>And indeed, this seems to be the case.  Some humans feel their choices
<br>
largely free, others feel their choices large constrained -- and this can be
<br>
the case even when the humans in question are dealing with rather similar
<br>
sets of choices.
<br>
<p>This leaves me wondering why we should value this particular psychological
<br>
state (the feeling of &quot;freedom&quot;) *so* highly as some of us do.  [I note that
<br>
the lofty valuation we place on freedom is an artifact of modern Western
<br>
culture; it was/is not there in all prior human cultures, to be sure.]
<br>
<p>I do value it, personally -- among many other things.  But reflecting on in
<br>
carefully, I'm not sure it should be one of the highest values.
<br>
<p>In some cases, a mind's estimate of its own freedom may decrease as the mind
<br>
becomes more aware of its own state and dynamics, and the state and dynamics
<br>
of the world around it.  Greater awareness may eliminate that aspect of the
<br>
feeling of freedom that is caused by ignorance....  For example, ignorance
<br>
of the complex unconscious dynamics that are inexorably impelling one's
<br>
choices in a certain direction...
<br>
<p>In other cases, greater awareness may of course cause an increase in the
<br>
feeling of freedom, as one becomes aware of avenues and opportunities not
<br>
previously perceivable...
<br>
<p>So the relation btw increasing intelligence/awareness and the feeling of
<br>
freedom, does not seem particulary simple or obvious to me...
