<p>Write what you mean.  If it turns out that you meant something other 
<br>
than what you communicated, you'll improve your writing when you have 
<br>
to explain it again.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I didn't even say anything about the use of the term 
<br>
`natural rights' until someone started to base their arguments on it.  
<br>
If you talk about `natural rights' but argue like you mean something 
<br>
else, then I'll let it slide.  If you talk about natural rights and 
<br>
seem to mean natural rights, then we have a problem.
<br>
<p>In general, if you say X and X is wrong but you really meant Y, I'll 
<br>
leave you alone.  If you say X and X is wrong and you seem to mean X, 
<br>
then it's time to say something.
