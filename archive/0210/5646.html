Dear SL4,
<br>
<p>A recent post to extropians got me thinking about freedom and Friendly AI.  In
<br>
the past I have opined that what FAI is _about_ is maximizing our options
<br>
(freedom) while minimizing dangers to our existance.  On the occasions when I
<br>
have said/written this, a little alarm bell would ring in my mind - &quot;Rrrring!
<br>
You need to figure out what freedom is!&quot;  So, when I read Charles' post, it was
<br>
like a wake-up call.  Charles gave me permission to repost here...

</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;       Please define a free person.

<em>&gt; Ouch!  I've been working on that for years, and don't have a good clue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I know internally what it feels like (i.e., it feels non-coerced, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feels like choices are possible, but not forced).  I don't have many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples of what it looks like, because it's a bit difficult to go up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone and say &quot;Excuse me.  Two minutes ago, when you did X, were you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting at free choice amoung several possibilities, or did you feel that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one choice was plausible?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, as a first shot, and clearly understanding that it needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refinement:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) A person is free when that person is making a choice among several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived plausible choices, and also feels that not choosing would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) There are degrees of freedom.  It's not an either / or state.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are no infinities and no zeros.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) If only one of the choices perceived as available is also perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as desireable, the amount of freedom present is minor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) If none of the choices presented as available are also perceived as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desireable, the person has less freedom than under condition 3.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) If no difference in the desirability of the choices available is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discernable, but the choices are perceived as essentially different,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the freedom approaches the maximum possible, and increases in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct proportion to the number of perceived choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; N.B.:  While state 5 is maximally free, this does not equate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximally desireable.  If you don't feel that your choice makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference, or that there is no difference in the desireability between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the choices, you may be quite free, but you won't feel enpowered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, all of these criteria appear to me to be based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unobservables.  Possibly one could, in principle, detect the differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using PET or MRI, but with currently envisionable technologies, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would always be in a state of restraint, and therefore the object of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigation would be missing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - -- Charles Hixson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gnu software that is free,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best is yet to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Charles felt that these ideas were a little 'half baked'... I understand this
<br>
feeling.  I would like to continue baking them now.
<br>
<p>It has been bought up before that the 'Friendliness content' will be a
<br>
significant and troublesome part of any implimentation of Friendliness.
<br>
Although we may find some comfort in the hope that Friendly architecture (as
<br>
outlined in <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/index.html">http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/index.html</a>) will correct whatever
<br>
content mistakes we make, it is undoubtedly of high importance that we try and
<br>
give the AI a good set of baseline data.  This will require us to have a very
<br>
good idea about what we mean when we say &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;responsibility&quot;,
<br>
&quot;volition&quot;, etc. so that we will have a reasonable chance of explaining it to
<br>
the AI.  Providing examples, and feedback to an AI, is of course essential...
<br>
but the human programmer-educators (us) should think through the issues, and lay
<br>
them out in advance.  This will help avoid mistakes due to shallow-thinking,
<br>
answers adversely affected by EP, and knee-jerk answers.
<br>
<p>One of the things about Charles' list that got my attention was that I could
<br>
imagine coding an analogy of them in a microdomain.  As microdomains are
<br>
currently Eliezer's preferred avenue for seed education, this would seem
<br>
entirely 'on point' for discussion.
<br>
<p>To kick off the discussion, I will now take issue with item 5.  I rewrite it as
<br>
follows:
<br>
<p>5) If the difference in the desirability of the choices available is discernable
<br>
and of wide distribution, from very desireable to very undesireable with lots of
<br>
points in the middle, and the choices are perceived as essentially different,
<br>
then the freedom approaches the maximum possible, and increases in direct
<br>
proportion to the number of perceived choices, and the width of the
<br>
distribution.
<br>
<p>Also I would like to address:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, all of these criteria appear to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be based on unobservables.
</em><br>
<p>This is currently true.  We cannot yet delve into the brain and figure out how
<br>
it judges one choice better than another.  We can currently only reason about
<br>
the choices on the higher level of self-analysis.  However, this will become a
<br>
false statement as soon as we can perform detailed real-time analysis &amp;
<br>
simulation of a human brain.  At that time the 'criteria', the models used by
<br>
the brain to compare and contrast choices, will be observable.
<br>

SL4 challenge: Improve and clarify the 'states of freedom' list so we can teach
them to a seed.
