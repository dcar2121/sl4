<p>Nonsense.  A PD human can through some diligence act beyond 
<br>
evolutionary programming. We do it quite often. If we could not 
<br>
do that we would not be having this conversation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is the probability, that it will result with the highest result? That some shadow on her mind, wouldn't directed the result several levels bellow optimal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>There is no real reason for me to believe that an FAI would 
<br>
utterly free of &quot;shadows&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How could FAI make an autistic person happy? His only volition is - live me alone!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That seems to imply a not so great understanding of autism. 
<br>
Autistic people can be reached often, even by us befuddled PD 
<br>
humans.  I am sure an FAI could do a much better job of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Friendliness above certain level only? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Who/what determines this?  It would be quite arbitrary.  There 
<br>
are PD humans that devote their entire lives to mastering 
<br>
Friendliness in a very deep sense and going beyond evolutionary 
<br>
programming.  Do you think just because we programmed the seed 
<br>
(heaven help the FAI) and it then reprogrammed itself that the 
<br>
FAI will be without error?   To the extent we think that I 
<br>
believe we are engaging in wishful thinking and FAI worship.
