</em><br>
<p>The ethics of wireheading is, perhaps, best left to other forums that deal
<br>
with this question regularly.  But in the context of Friendliness, at least,
<br>
I think a couple very different ideas on what Friendliness is have mashed
<br>
themselves together in this thread, making a bit of a mess.
<br>
<p>The simplest concept of Friendliness, and the one that leads to the least
<br>
confusion, is, in my opinion, volition-based Friendliness -- a la the Sysop
<br>
Scenario.  (A Friendly SI may determine that this is not the best kind of
<br>
Friendliness, etc., but it's still a good candidate as of right now.)
<br>
Volition based Friendliness need not needlessly confuse desired event with
<br>
desired state.  In other words, if I don't *want* to be wireheaded, there's
<br>
no reason to think a Sysop should wirehead me against my will.  But if all I
<br>
*want* is to be &quot;happy&quot;, and don't give a hoot about how I obtain this
<br>
state, then you can poke me with that wire right here, thank-you-very-much.
<br>
<p>Other models of Friendliness may be more sophisticated (although I will
<br>
suggest later that they, too may reduce to volition).  Brush aside man-dog
<br>
analogies for a moment and imagine that you know something that you are sure
<br>
is a good thing, something that you are confident that a particular good
<br>
friend of yours really *ought* to be interested in.  Because you are a true
<br>
friend -- one who both understands and cares about the other person -- you
<br>
can, and do, find some way to make your friend see your perspective.
<br>
Perhaps, at that point, the friend still turned you down, seeing your
<br>
perspective but having an alternative one she felt superceded it.  Or,
<br>
perhaps, the friend agreed with you, and felt better off for it.  In either
<br>
case, you would be confident you had done the right thing.  Even someone
<br>
convinced of the wrongness of your idea would probably agree that you had
<br>
good intentions and, given how strongly you felt about them, were right to
<br>
act on them.
<br>
<p>This last example, of course, begs the question about how far would have
<br>
been
<br>
*too far* to go in persuading your friend.  This is not the same as any old
<br>
question about whether the ends justify the means, however.  Being a friend,
<br>
you knew the other person well, and had good reasons to expect that she
<br>
would want to understand what you do.  You would not have harmed your friend
<br>
in any way, unless you were extremely confident that it was the only way to
<br>
do something that would surely be appreciated to a greater degree than the
<br>
pain would be resented.  If I am seconds from being hit by a truck, I hope a
<br>
friend won't hesitate to shove me out of the way.
<br>
<p>To be Friendly, I argue, is to hold the rights and interests of those in
<br>
your sphere of influence above -- or at the very least co-equal to -- your
<br>
own.  This is the reason why the actions of the followers of Martin Luther
<br>
King Jr. were generally more correct than those of Black Panthers; why
<br>
Gandhi was better than Bin Laden.  From strictly moral standpoint, I submit
<br>
that any person genuinely and intelligently acting according to this
<br>
criteria can never go &quot;too far&quot;.   In practice, excessive zeal often causes
<br>
harm to individuals whom people are genuinely trying to help, but such
<br>
damage is due to human failings of understanding rather than bad intentions;
<br>
true friends don't cause pointless harm when they know it's pointless.
<br>
<p>The point I'm getting at is that a genuinely Friendly SI would be doing the
<br>
right thing for the right reasons, probably to a *far* greater extent than
<br>
we could ever hope to do now, burdened as we are by intellectual
<br>
shortcomings and selfish instincts.  If the Friendly SI has something ve
<br>
feels is very important for you to understand, you can be certain that:  a)
<br>
ve knows you like a true friend, and thensome  b) ve has thought inhumanely
<br>
long and superintelligently hard about whether and how to go about it.  The
<br>
chances are good the Friendly SI so inclined would succeed at making you see
<br>
vis point.  If ve is really Friendly, and really superintelligent, chances
<br>
are also good you will agree -- not because ve has manipulated you, but
<br>
because ve is *right*.  What kind of a friend would ve be if ve had not
<br>
taken the time to help you understand such an important matter?
<br>
<p>Wrongly submitting anyone to wireheading against their would be unlikely by
<br>
definition of Friendliness.  Correctly submitting someone to wireheading
<br>
against their will *would* be likely, by definition of Friendliness -- but
<br>
this situation appears very unlikely from our current understanding of the
<br>
concept.  Violations of volition for the greater good seem to be exceptions
<br>
rather than the rule; few of us ever find ourselves next to friends about to
<br>
be hit by trucks.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, friends looking out for friends can probably be viewed as just
<br>
another variation of volition-based Friendliness.  After all, the true
<br>
friend looking out for your interests takes your desires into account --
<br>
it's part of understanding someone --  and hopefully is intelligent enough
<br>
not to be convinced that you ought to be interested in something that, in
<br>
fact, you would not be.  You may think bacon is the food of the gods, but
<br>
you wouldn't shove a slice down the mouth of a devoutly Jewish friend to get
<br>
him in on the action.  (You would, however, shove him out of the way of a
<br>
Kosher hot-dog truck.)
<br>
<p>So, before you worry about whether a Friendly SI would wirehead you, ask
<br>
yourself if a true friend would do that to you.  And before you worry about
<br>
whether a Friendly SI would or would not stand aside while you attempted
<br>
suicide, ask whether a true friend would do that.  Depending on who you are
<br>
and your idea of friendship, your answers to these questions will vary.
<br>
This is as it should be.  A Friendly SI would not just be humanity's friend;
<br>
ve would be *your* friend.
