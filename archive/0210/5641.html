Hi,

<em>&gt; The difference between human and animal consciousness can be
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a key difference between human and machine consciousness will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the machines' detailed model of billions of human minds, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrast to our detailed model of about 200 human minds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because of the physical limits of human brains, our models of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billions of human minds are averaged out. But machine brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that exceed our physical limits will be have detailed models
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of billions of human minds.
</em><br>
<p>This ties in with a key point that has often been made on this list:
<br>
superintelligent AI's will have a superior ability to model and analyze
<br>
*themselves*.
<br>
<p>I think that in the early stages of human-level general intelligence, the
<br>
ability of an AI to model billions of human minds will be useful to it.
<br>
<p>Once it passes a certain level of intelligence, however, modeling human
<br>
minds will be no more interesting to it than modeling cockroach minds is to
<br>
a human....  Modeling other superintelligent minds (if indeed there is more
<br>
than one) will more likely be of interest...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The statement &quot;the essential property of consciousness in humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and animals is that it enables brains to process experiences that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not actually occuring&quot; says something pretty rigorous. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplest animal brains can only process events as they happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But at some level of evolution, brains break free of &quot;now&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the temporal credit assignment problem is a well known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rigorous problem. There has been some very exciting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscience into how brains solve this problem, at least when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delays between behaviors and rewards are short and predictable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the paper:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Brown, J., Bullock, D., and Grossberg, S. How the Basal Ganglia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Use Parallel Excitatory and Inhibitory Learning Pathways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Selectively Respond to Unexpected Rewarding Cues. Journal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Neuroscience 19(23), 10502-10511. 1999.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is available on-line at:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://cns-web.bu.edu/pub/diana/BroBulGro99.pdf">http://cns-web.bu.edu/pub/diana/BroBulGro99.pdf</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the need to solve the temporal credit assignment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem when delays between behaviors and rewards are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; short and predictable was the selectional force behind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution of consciousness. Any known effective solution to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this problem requires a simulation model of the world.
</em><br>
<p>I basically agree with these comments.  In our work with Webmind and
<br>
Novamente, we found that what we call &quot;experiential schema learning&quot; was the
<br>
hardest problem we faced.  And temporal credit assignment is one of the
<br>
tricky parts of experiential schema learning....
<br>
<p>It's a problem that human minds solve only by using some really poor
<br>
heuristics, and current narrow-AI programs don't solve at all.  We didn't
<br>
really solve it in Webmind, though we were starting to make some interesting
<br>
headway on small problems when the project died for financial reasons in
<br>
March 2001.  At our current rate of progress we're probably a year from
<br>
approaching this problem in Novamente (though a couple more kick-ass
<br>
volunteer coders with a lot of time on their hands could speed things up a
<br>
little... ;).
