<em>&gt; If you're interacting as an equal, you can try and convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things, and they can try and convince you back.  But if you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially transhuman brainpower and can model people from the design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stance, such that you have the power to convince people of arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propositions, at that point what you are doing ceases to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;argument&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes &quot;mind control&quot;, unless the discussion is carried out *solely*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to the wishes of the person being talked to.
</em><br>
<p>What's the mechanism by which the big brain obtains information on what the
<br>
wishes of the little brain are without contaminating the little brain by
<br>
requesting information or passively making information available to let the
<br>
little brain know it should be formulating wishes? I don't see a level at
<br>
which any minimal conversation or interaction to determine wishes is not
<br>
mind control of those wishes (in some way meaningful to the big brain) if
<br>
you define mind control (advertantly or otherwise) as you did in your
<br>
previous e-mail.
<br>
<p>In light of that thought, the old, old SF story on Pascal's Wager, the
<br>
all-powerful energy being, the jolts in boxes and the mechanistical
<br>
cockroach lifeforms springs to mind. (I can remember that lot, but not the
<br>
name of the piece. Oh well).
