Yedidya,
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I suggest you (Gordon) adopt a less cocksure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitude.
</em><br>
<p>This is almost always good advice (Gordon! ;), but not always.  If you're right,
<br>
you're right.  There is no point softening it, that just wastes time and
<br>
complicates discussion.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; As in when seeing a seeming error on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another's part, trying to see what they really mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of assuming they are simply incorrect.
</em><br>
<p>This is poor advice.  One should judge posters on what they actually post, not
<br>
what you *think* they posted, or what they *seemed* to post.
<br>
<p><p>Michael Roy Ames
