Yedidya,

<p>Not necessarily.  Soft may be more pleasant to read, but it may not provide
<br>
precise communication, and it may waste time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Our perceptions do not reflect reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; %100. Our language is imprecise. We have emotions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we did not choose to have; we do not react only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the content of a message, rather to both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content and the style. Therefore there is a point to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; softening styles of speech, as well as styles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  And the point is: if there is need to ingratiate yourself with your
<br>
readers, then one must write in a style that keeps them happy.  But pandering to
<br>
the readers is not what SL4 is about AFAIK.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One shouldn't judge posters at all, one should just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strive try to clarify views and improve understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such as &quot;if you meant what you seem to have meant, X,&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (statement X in as clear terms as Responder can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manage), &quot; then this seems to me incorrect, for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following reasons...&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>There is an argument to be made for utility in judging posters as well as posts.
<br>
I shy away from neither.  Judging a poster is not something to be avoided, any
<br>
more than judging a poster's ideas is to be avoided.  Admittedly extrapolating a
<br>
viewpoint about a complete person from just a few posts is going to be very
<br>
error prone, but making the attempt to do so often produces useful information.
<br>
A larger 'pipe' is of course desirable when making assessments about someone.
<br>
Nothing beats 'face-to-face' communication... yet!
<br>
<p>Far be it from me to disuade anyone from 'playing nice'.  Just don't let it
<br>
interfere with making an effective argument, in an approriate setting (like this
<br>
is).  I have witnessed too many occations when an intelligent person with a good
<br>
idea will keep thier mouth shut because they don't want to give offense.  Such a
<br>
waste!
<br>
<p>On a personal note: it *is* nice talking with you Yedidya  :)
