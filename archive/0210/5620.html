</em><br>
<p>How exactly do you go about finding morality? I suspect the answer from you 
<br>
or Eli would be something like, &quot;We don't know. We're not smart enough yet&quot;. 
<br>
How then do you program something to learn to search for morality when it is 
<br>
intelligent enough to do so?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And if there is no correct morality, then it will figure that out, too.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is most likely the case. The idea of a &quot;correct&quot; morality is as 
<br>
wierd as the idea of a &quot;correct&quot; set of rules for a game. First you must 
<br>
decide what the game should be like, and then create the rules. IMO morality 
<br>
can be thought of as rules for interaction between humans. If you have 
<br>
defined a certain society that you want, you might (theoretically at least) 
<br>
be able to define the morality that would bring about that society (if 
<br>
people live by it).
<br>
<p>So the question then becomes if there is a &quot;correct&quot; society (probably bad 
<br>
word for post-singularity existence, but WTH). The FAI would in that case 
<br>
have to &quot;find&quot; this correct society, and then create the morality that comes 
<br>
with it. And as history shows, everyone has their own take on the correct 
<br>
society...
<br>
<p>There is also an interesting discussion about the *enforcement* of morality, 
<br>
but it's getting late now...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is nothing wrong with discussing morality; you need some system by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which to decide what is right and wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I think it is a fallacy to believe that this system can be determined 
<br>
objectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Discussing the morality of an SIFAI is silliness, though.
</em><br>
<p>Of course. Any discussion of the motivations of an SI is pure speculation at 
<br>
best.
