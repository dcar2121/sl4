</em><br>
<p>Well, I didn't just make up the term &quot;volition-based Friendliness&quot;, nor did
<br>
I work from a completely made up definition.  Quoting CFAI, section 1.3:
<br>
<p>&quot;Thus, Creating Friendly AI uses &quot;volition-based Friendliness&quot; as the
<br>
assumed model for Friendliness content.  Volition-based Friendliness has
<br>
both a negative aspect - don't cause involuntary pain, death, alteration, et
<br>
cetera; try to do something about those things if you see them happening -
<br>
and a positive aspect: to try and fulfill the requests of sentient
<br>
entities.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Volition-based morality is a theory that a human named Eliezer S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yudkowsky has proposed as being closer to correctness than, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christian morality.  Humans, though, have too limited a mental capacity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to check the correctness of a moral theory, so an FAI's initial moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory (if one is given to the AI) is irrelevant because all known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories are equally likely to be wrong.
</em><br>
<p>There's no guarantee that an SI can check the correctness of a moral theory
<br>
either, since we don't know yet what that will take.  I think it's all well
<br>
and good to recognize that, whatever it is we want to figure out (morality,
<br>
etc.), a superintelligence will be more capable of succeeding.  But you are
<br>
correct that we do have to work in the meantime based with what we know.
<br>
And yes, focusing on volition is one of the better systems around to do
<br>
this.  But I'm not ready to say that volition has only a 0.73 percent chance
<br>
of correctness as opposed to Christianity's 0.0001 chance.  I think the fact
<br>
that other systems so frequently reduce to a low denomenator of volition
<br>
putts the odds of its correctness *much* higher, though I am, of course,
<br>
just guessing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is nothing wrong with discussing morality; you need some system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by which to decide what is right and wrong.  Otherwise you think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything is right or, less often seen, everything is wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discussing the morality of an SIFAI is silliness, though.  Beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of human level AI, all you can do is make guesses.  Some guesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may turn out to be better than others, but they're still all just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guesses.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  This silliness is what I was trying to show.  I obviously don't
<br>
know what things are going to look like post-Singularity -- there had
<br>
certainly better be more going on that speeding trucks.  But I do think it
<br>
is silly to apply a transhuman characteristic to a Friendly SI (such as
<br>
total understanding of human cognition) and then worry about it being
<br>
applied in a mundanely human way (&quot;manipulation&quot;).  To have an exhaustive
<br>
understanding of how the mind works is to be able to completely avoid
<br>
whatever the SI or the human might define as manipulation.  It is also the
<br>
ability to anticipate a human's desire to avoid conditions like wireheading.
<br>
In short, greater intelligence and understanding are the keyn to accurately
<br>
mapping out the boundaries of volition.
