<p>I thought that everyone here was beyond the errors of natural rights, 
<br>
but I guess not.  Here's a little link for you:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.spectacle.org/0400/natural.html">http://www.spectacle.org/0400/natural.html</a>
<br>
<p>There are probably better links, but I'm not going to take the time to 
<br>
find them.
<br>
<p>Also, let's not debate natural rights here; it's already a dead horse.  
<br>
If you want to discuss it, there are many forums on the Internet for 
<br>
discussion of philosophy, religion, and logic.
