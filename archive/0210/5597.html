Subject:  On joining organizations to &quot;keep an eye on them&quot;
<br>
<p>An interesting anecdote: During Israel's early days, there existed a
<br>
certain terrorist organization. Mossad infiltrated this organization so
<br>
thoroughly that they later found that one in ten members was a Mossad
<br>
agent. Moreover, they later found that the only reason the organization
<br>
had been staying afloat was that the Mossad agents were the only ones
<br>
actually paying their dues.
<br>
<p>I'd thus like to advise everyone not to join organizations unless they
<br>
really, truly believe that the organization will be effective and is
<br>
something they wish to be part of. Otherwise, everyone joins a bad
<br>
effort &quot;to keep an eye on it&quot; and keeps it alive where the effort
<br>
would otherwise have died a quiet death.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Eliezer.
