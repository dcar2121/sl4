<p>I am not at all a suicidal person.  However, some claim that I 
<br>
owe other people continuing to live even if I find no happiness 
<br>
in it would be enough to put many over the edge.  That is about 
<br>
the most vicious collectivist statement I have seen in some 
<br>
time.  I don't live for others to draw value from me.  I live 
<br>
because living itself is of value to me.  I contribute out of 
<br>
strength, joy and wanting to make a difference.  I don't do so 
<br>
because I am enslaved by some &quot;duty&quot; to others.  Seeing it as 
<br>
duty where even such a personal and fundamental decision as 
<br>
whether to live or die is determined by the collective is a very 
<br>
dark way to look at life and the world.
