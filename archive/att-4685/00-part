I don't. I assume, it would be super rational, only. Otherwise, it's a failed Singularity. Not a friendly, at least.

I see the total unpredictability of a Singularity as a myth. 

It's not (only) the question of the resources - it's of the morality. Some Powers wouldn't permit AIDS in Africa, if they were not morally defected.
