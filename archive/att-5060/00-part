Why I don't like Multiverse?

Be cause I always get some finite number of photons from the "other worlds" in this interference experiment.

But from time to time, there should be none. And my experiment should fail. But it never does.

If I decide to conduct the experiment ONLY if I win a lottery, I should be (nearly) alone, if there is a finite number of parallel worlds.  If there is an infinite number of them - I should get MANY of them, every time I do the experiment. More, then from the Sun.

That's why I don't find Everet's Multiverse plausible.
