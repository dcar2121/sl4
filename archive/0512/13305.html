On Wed, 28 Dec 2005 &quot;Richard Loosemore&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20Free%20Will%20debate%20[WAS%20Free%20Will%20not%20an%20illusion.%20AND%20impotent%20disorganized%20gods?">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it is possible that conscious systems have effects on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world that are grossly at odds with the the &quot;cause and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect&quot; pattern that we see in  normal science. 
</em><br>
<p>The normal cause and effect pattern is that everything happens because
<br>
of cause and effect or it does not and so is random; and even in the
<br>
unlikely event that voodoo turns out to be true that will not change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I personally have very strong evidence that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something_ going on out there that is not encompassed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by normal science. 
</em><br>
<p>Then you should be writing your Nobel Prize acceptance speech not
<br>
gabbing on the internet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't care to try to justify this to anyone else anymore
</em><br>
<p>Oh dear that could be a problem, the Nobel Prize committee prefers it if
<br>
scientists can justify their results. Perhaps you’d better cancel that
<br>
reservation to Stockholm.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; because the eventual response from skeptics is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimenter deceipt is a satisfactory explanation for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results that I got, and that is rather tedious if you are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimenter 
</em><br>
<p>Can you really blame people for having this reaction?  No area of
<br>
Science, if that’s what you want to call it, has a more dismal record of
<br>
wishful thinking, sloppiness, naivety, and downright fraud than
<br>
parapsychology. And even that is an understatement, few areas of human
<br>
activity has proven itself to be less productive than parapsychology.
<br>
After working hard on this for one century the net result is exactly
<br>
zero; and I’m not talking about something as ambitious as explaining how
<br>
it works, I’m just talking about showing there is something that needs
<br>
explaining. These witch doctors, I mean scientists, can’t even do that.  
<br>
<p>We could have been having this exact same conversation one century ago,
<br>
and in fact many people did. Back then fortune tellers and palm readers
<br>
insisted there was all sorts of fascinating stuff going on in the world
<br>
that mainstream science, for reasons never clearly explained, ignored.
<br>
Today the situation is exactly the same. Back then there was an inverse
<br>
relationship between the rigor of the experiment and the spectacular
<br>
results produced. Today the situation is exactly the same. Back then the
<br>
evidence for the existence of this odd phenomenon stank. It still stinks
<br>
today. 
<br>
<p>You can’t prove something never happens, but after  experiment after
<br>
experiment produces nothing of interest a wise scientist realizes he’s
<br>
running up a blind alley and moves on to something else.
