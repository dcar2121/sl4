<p>I don't think this is correct in the sense that you appear
<br>
to be implying. It is certainly true that we're going to
<br>
need much better software than we have right now to get a
<br>
Singularity started, be it by designed AGI, brain simulation
<br>
or human-computer interfacing (though there is a slight
<br>
possibility that we might genetically engineer more
<br>
intelligent humans first, or make an AGI using current GAs
<br>
running on extremely powerful quantum and/or nanoassembled
<br>
hardware). But even if we can do no more than match the
<br>
computational efficiency of the human brain, even /current/
<br>
hardware can run ten million times faster and will soon be
<br>
able to scale to even higher levels of parallelism. The
<br>
physical limits of computation, and even the limits of what
<br>
looks achievable given current hardware engineering
<br>
knowledge, are vastly beyond what the human brain appears
<br>
to be capable of.
<br>
<p>Remember that Vinge's original usage of 'Singularity'
<br>
referred only to a sharp predictive barrier beyond which we
<br>
cannot make any useful predictions about what the world
<br>
will be like. As Eliezer pointed out in 'Staring into the
<br>
Singularity', it really doesn't take much of an improvement
<br>
in intelligence (even without a change in cognitive
<br>
architecture, or the effects of being able to self-modify
<br>
at a coarse level) before this horizon pops up. The whole
<br>
'exponentially accelerating change across tens of orders of
<br>
magnitude, right up to the ultimate limits on computation'
<br>
idea, while popular in these parts, isn't a prerequisite
<br>
for a Singularity. If we can get over that initial software
<br>
problem of building something roughly as intelligent as we
<br>
are, there is already more than enough technology waiting
<br>
to take that entity/entities far beyond the realm of human
<br>
equivalence, very quickly.
<br>
<p>As it happens I do think that there is vast scope for
<br>
software improvement as well as hardware improvement, and
<br>
that the absolute difficulty of the problem using optimal
<br>
methods scales rather slower than the power of the system
<br>
being designed, but that's just personal opinion based on
<br>
private research. I don't have to be right about this for
<br>
the above reasoning to be valid.
