<br>
<em>&gt; The availability of resources is much less relevant than group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamics which, in this case, place strong bounds on the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources that do end up producing publicly visible discussion, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not just a lot of silence. The &quot;valuable and limited&quot; resources you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably have in mind are people who often wouldn't really be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in popularizing, and fighting the consequent popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mischaracterization, of transhumanist ideas. Other people with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, less expertise, and a willingness to do this sort of thing can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than make up for that.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but what is the point? There's, from a singularitarian standpoint, one
<br>
fundamental criterion to use when judging the utility of something: is this
<br>
likely to increase the probability of FAI? In my view, unqualified
<br>
visibility isn't necessarily useful from this standpoint.
<br>
<p>Visibility among technical people likely to contribute, though, is. But
<br>
that's an entirely different matter, and in fact popular mischaracterization
<br>
of transhuman/singularitarian ideas might be counterproductive, driving
<br>
people away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, you disagree with the basic premise of the post I was responding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to, that transhumanist causes are rather improverished as far as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public visibility of the debate over those issues? You think that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current visibility is enough? Well, then, it doesn't really matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we do one way or another to increase it. But I think you'll find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many people here that disagree with you.
</em><br>
<p>It might matter if transhuman ideas, the singularity, the whole field of AI,
<br>
become popularized in such a way that they drive tehcnically-minded,
<br>
intelligent people away, because the popular understanding thereof is
<br>
clearly bogus. I'm not saying a visibility campaign has such an inevitable
<br>
result, but it is one of the possible ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To limit one's audience to those with a lot of intelligence and who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are conversant in the technical language used by transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocates is to effectively seal debate about transhumanism from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public sphere. I think Brandon Reinhart realizes this, and it bothers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I am not qualified to debate superstring theory, much as I would like
<br>
to think otherwise, and a good proportion of the public is not qualified to
<br>
debate FAI, the singularity, effects of MNT, etc.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the good thing is, if I wanted and I took the time I
<br>
could make myself capable to debate superstring theory, and if a member of
<br>
the public feels compelled to get informed they can as well get ready to
<br>
debate transhuman issues, in principle.
<br>
<p>--David.
