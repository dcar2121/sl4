<em>&gt; You seem to be indicating that an AI goal system should include the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregard if I have misinterpreted). In my opinion the goal system problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has already been solved by philosophical ethics.
</em><br>
<p>There are many competing theories of philosophical ethics.  Most of
<br>
them are loaded with 18th and 19th century premises and assumptions,
<br>
and most exhibit an intrinsic duality between man and nature that
<br>
appears almost childlike in its naivete when seen from a traditional
<br>
eastern philosophical perspective, or from the perspective of modern
<br>
evolutionary and cognitive science together with a developing
<br>
appreciation of dynamical systems.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The goal is the greatest amount of freedom for the most people.
</em><br>
<p>You might consider that, rather than maximizing freedom, a balance of
<br>
freedoms with responsibilities is necessary at each step of the way to
<br>
achieving growth toward the kind of world that best represents the
<br>
shared values of humanity. While such growth does tend to lead toward
<br>
increasing freedoms, in no sense is this a primary goal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This implies, I think, that an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be directed by the categorical imperetive just as humans are.
</em><br>
<p>While the categorical imperative is one theory of how humans *should*
<br>
direct their moral decision-making, few people would agree that this
<br>
is how humans *are* directed.
<br>
<p>Kant's categorical imperative has some serious weaknesses, visible
<br>
even in its day.  For example, the idealist notion of maximizing
<br>
rather than satisficing.  Or the idealist notion of an imperative that
<br>
is truly categorical in its application, including, for example,
<br>
telling the truth to a crazed gunman asking where your children are
<br>
hiding.  Yes, Kant actually defended this absolute deontological point
<br>
of view.
<br>
<p>? The
<br>
<em>&gt; only way to ensure that an AI will be able to succsesfully use this logic is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if its own highest goal is freedom. This is because the categorical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperetive restricts actions that one would not will to be permissible in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general. The categorical imperative also restricts treating any rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent as only a means to an end - in other words as a tool.  Therefor,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to this ethical system, we must treat any AI life forms as people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with all the rights of people and demand that they treat other rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents the same way.
</em><br>
<p>Another example of naive idealism, thinking that humans are rational
<br>
agents, or that all such rational agents are somehow equal (by what
<br>
measure?) or should be categorically treated *as if* they were.  Some
<br>
of these idealistic principles served well in their particular time
<br>
and place, as a counter to the oppressions of the time, but that does
<br>
not mean they are universally true in an evolving and expanding
<br>
context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a simple solution to an otherwise very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated problem. Its a fairly simple logic that can easily be proggramed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into an AI.
</em><br>
<p>There is no simple solution for survival and growth within a
<br>
coevolutionary environment, whether you conceive it to be &quot;maximizing
<br>
for individual freedom&quot; or &quot;promoting the growth of shared human
<br>
values.&quot;  I think society will come to agree that there are relatively
<br>
simple principles for developing approximate solutions at each step of
<br>
the way, principles such as the scientific method for increasingly
<br>
objective, instrumental knowledge to implement our choices, and
<br>
principles of synergy, creativity and cooperation that will guide our
<br>
choices toward growth in terms of our values, but the ultimate
<br>
*solution* will always be ahead of us, even its definition evolving.
