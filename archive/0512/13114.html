<p>
Ben,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks. I don't know very much at all about SIAI or Mr. Eliezer so the opinion of someone who knows more than I do is something.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting hypothetical situation to consider because explanations are not obvious. (The hypothetical could be even more amped up if the AGI recommended the *immediate* destruction of all humanity.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not clear on your criteria for enacting/not enacting the AGI's recommendation - some sort of cost-benefit analysis? Benefit to outweigh your own extermination? What could the criteria be,,,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gej

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi,
<br>
<p>I don't normally respond for other people nor for organizations I
<br>
don't belong to, but in this case, since no one from SIAI has
<br>
responded yet and the allegation is so silly, I'll make an exception.
<br>
<p>No, this is not SIAI's official opinion, and I am also quite sure that
<br>
it is it not Eliezer's opinion.
<br>
<p>Whether it is *like* anything Eliezer has ever said is a different
<br>
question, and depends upon your similarity measure!
<br>
<p>Speaking for myself now (NOT Eliezer or anyone else): I can imagine a
<br>
scenario where I created an AGI to decide, based on my own value
<br>
system, what would be the best outcome for the universe. I can
<br>
imagine working with this AGI long enough that I really trusted it,
<br>
and then having this AGI conclude that the best outcome for the
<br>
universe involves having the human race (including me) stop existing
<br>
and having our particles used in some different way. I can imagine,
<br>
in this scenario, having a significant desire to actually go along
<br>
with the AGI's opinion, though I doubt that I would do so. (Perhaps I
<br>
would do so if I were wholly convinced that the overall state of the
<br>
universe would be a LOT better if the human race's particles were thus
<br>
re-purposed?)
<br>
<p>And, I suppose someone could twist the above paragraph to say that
<br>
&quot;Ben Goertzel says if a superintelligence should order all humans to
<br>
die, then all humans should die.&quot; But it would be quite a
<br>
misrepresentation...
