<em>&gt; Yes, just become a billionaire through the lottery and the debate is

</em><br>
<p><p>The comment about the lottery is a good one, but I think you're being a
<br>
little harsh - the field of paranormal research is certainly full of
<br>
charlatans and the mentally ill, but there is a minority of scientists who
<br>
are genuinely after the truth, whatever that turns out to be.
<br>
<p>I used to be interested in it as a teenager. Humanity lives in a streetlit
<br>
town surrounded by a dark forest, albeit one whose frontier retreats each
<br>
generation, and looking into the darkness I still wonder what might be out
<br>
there. In one particular direction, there are persistent reports of eyes
<br>
glinting in the light, just on the edge of vision, so the obvious thing to
<br>
do is to go there with a flashlight to see what might show up.
<br>
<p>The problem is that each time you shine a light where you thought you saw a
<br>
glint of eyes, there's nothing there - but you again see eyes glinting at
<br>
the edge of the new circle of light.
<br>
<p>Eventually I concluded the most reasonable explanation is that it's just our
<br>
own eyes playing tricks on us, and that my efforts are best spent in other
<br>
parts of the forest, where at least some of the things half-glimpsed in the
<br>
shadows turn out to be real when you shine a light on them. If other people
<br>
choose to continue chasing the glint of eyes in the first area, well, I wish
<br>
them luck, but I'm not optimistic about their chances.
<br>
<p>Happy New Year everyone!
<br>
<p>- Russell
