<p>
People use 'good' and 'bad' in fundamentally different ways - to mean:
<br>
<p>a) Good in itself (an invalid concept as far as I'm concerned - 'good' is
<br>
basically an adjective, not noun)
<br>
b) good to achieve a specified goal, seen as desirable by a specified
<br>
entity.
<br>
<p>See 'Good and Bad' in <a href="http://www.optimal.org/peter/rational_ethics.htm">http://www.optimal.org/peter/rational_ethics.htm</a>
<br>
<p>This also covers 'what morality is about'.

<br>
<p>The key question I was trying to put forth in this discussion is
<br>
whether we could all agree that for any agent, that which promotes the
<br>
agent's goals would necessarily be seen as good from the point of view
<br>
of that agent.  I think this is an important first step to
<br>
understanding what &quot;morality&quot; is really about, and it's amazing to me
<br>
how difficult it is to get anyone to address this and subsequent
<br>
questions in this line of thought in (what seems to me) a simple and
<br>
logical manner.  I'm interested in testing this, without getting into
<br>
a debating contest where people try to score by various indirect means
<br>
rather than simply working together to build a more encompassing
<br>
understanding.
<br>
