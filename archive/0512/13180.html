<p>
This is something that I have been concerned about but wasn't sure how to 
<br>
word it in a post.  Thank you for mentioning it.  It's all about the 
<br>
interpretation of the goals.  My concern was that, while goals are what 
<br>
power the intelligence, what kind of intelligence is used to interpret the 
<br>
goals?
<br>
<p>It seems like a chicken and egg problem unless you build a separate system 
<br>
just for interpreting these goals, but I think that more work should be done 
<br>
on goal interpretation, (which will be a major stepping stone to AI), 
<br>
particularly on interpreting a goal of friendliness.  I am sure that some 
<br>
would agree with me about the world not having much time, and if it seems 
<br>
like your theory is about as friendly as you can make it, then work on 
<br>
finding out how to make an AI interpret a goal of friendliness, because that 
<br>
will take just as much effort and time, and time is something that we have 
<br>
little of.

<p><em>&gt; The behavior of an AGI with such a goal would depend crucially on what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms it used to interpret the meaning of &quot;thinking is good&quot;.  So 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much so, in fact, that it becomes stupid to talk of the system as being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governed by the decision theory component:  it is not, it is governed by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever mechanisms you can cobble together to interpret that vague goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement.  What initially looked like the dog's tail (the mechanisms that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; govern the interpretation of goals) starts to wag the dog (the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision-theory-based goal engine).
