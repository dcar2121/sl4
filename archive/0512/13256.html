<em>&gt; I agree, mind is machine.  But this machine utilizes electricity.  So
</em><br>
quantum effects appear at some level.  Its not like anyone actually has a
<br>
freakin clue what (physical) effect(s) really gives rise to sentience.  I'm
<br>
guessing the chemistry of our brains interacts in a way to produce
<br>
<p>I think that's the problem of your hypothesis, it assumes something else
<br>
than informatics is going on, and necessary, to sentience. If you built a
<br>
replicating organism that would grow and reproduce, and exchange genetic
<br>
information with others of its kind, but it were not based on DNA and carbon
<br>
chemistry, say it were based on much bigger mechanical components, would you
<br>
say it is not alive? What is the distinguishing aliveness stuff? If you
<br>
built a computer with lego bricks and it gave you a square root of a number,
<br>
is that any different than when it is done by an electronic computer, and is
<br>
this any different than when it is done by a human brain? If a simmulation
<br>
of the neural processes, including potential feedback loops with the
<br>
emerging EM field, of a human brain within an environment were computed on
<br>
millions of abacus by the adherents to some odd cult trying to keep alive
<br>
and consciouss their creation, would you say that the sum total of this
<br>
process is non-sentient, because the informatics is happening on rods with
<br>
balls, and off-loaded onto other people's brains, instead of happening all
<br>
put together in the same place, although the information processing is
<br>
absolutely indistinguishable by any objective means possible?
