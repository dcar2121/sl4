<p>Micah, I don't know if you read my comments to you points yesterday,
<br>
or whether they seemed to make sense, since you didn't reply directly
<br>
to them.
<br>
<p>Your ideal of maximizing personal freedom sounds good (how could
<br>
something so powerful and so pure be wrong?)  but it is flawed because
<br>
it doesn't reflect how things work in the real world.
<br>
<p>It reminds me of the time when I was about 18 years old and I was
<br>
approached by a Scientology recruiter who offered me a &quot;class in
<br>
communications&quot;.  I went ahead and attended because I was interested
<br>
in seeing a little of what goes on there.  So after a couple of
<br>
sessions they wanted to have a one-on-one talk with me about the
<br>
amazing levels of personal freedom that they could offer.  They
<br>
literally said that at the highest level, called the Operating Thetan,
<br>
one could literally do or manifest anything one chose.  I then asked
<br>
the guy, who proudly declared himself to be a &quot;Clear&quot; and in complete
<br>
control of his emotions, if each of these OTs could do anything they
<br>
wanted, then what did they measure against to know how well they were
<br>
doing, and if there was no reference, then wasn't this whole concept a
<br>
bit meaningless?  Well, the &quot;Clear&quot; got obviously flustered, and that
<br>
was my last visit to their friendly house of power and enlightenment. 
<br>
(My parents still get mail from them, sent to my old address, some 30
<br>
years later.)
<br>
<p>As I suggested yesterday, the real world is not the ideal of the 18th
<br>
and 19th century philosophers, and an understanding of evolutionary
<br>
and cognitive science along with some other newer fields puts their
<br>
idealism into a broader and more practical perspective.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>The key question I was trying to put forth in this discussion is
<br>
whether we could all agree that for any agent, that which promotes the
<br>
agent's goals would necessarily be seen as good from the point of view
<br>
of that agent.  I think this is an important first step to
<br>
understanding what &quot;morality&quot; is really about, and it's amazing to me
<br>
how difficult it is to get anyone to address this and subsequent
<br>
questions in this line of thought in (what seems to me) a simple and
<br>
logical manner.  I'm interested in testing this, without getting into
<br>
a debating contest where people try to score by various indirect means
<br>
rather than simply working together to build a more encompassing
<br>
understanding.
<br>
