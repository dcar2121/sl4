Phillip -
<br>
<p>I experienced mixed feelings about my comment right about the moment I
<br>
hit Send, so I'm glad what I said didn't demotivate you.  I think it's
<br>
important for people to have these discussions to test and refine
<br>
their thinking, but beyond a certain point it's mostly regression to
<br>
the mean. I'm personally close to boiling over with frustration at the
<br>
inefficiencies of the current discussion lists, and I haven't decided
<br>
whether I should get some distance to regain my reserve (my usual
<br>
mode) or jump into the fray and stir things up (sometimes useful, but
<br>
sometimes destructive.)  A better strategy would be to personally
<br>
spend more time with like-minded people building a more effective
<br>
collaborative knowledge framework, but I haven't found a way to fit
<br>
that into my schedule.

<em>&gt; Sorry, my post was crap.  I never presented any argument beyond circular

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was making a garbled attempt to expose two very different ethics, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct one to apply depends on whether or not we have a shot at an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy source.  And I was also confusing the process of human utilitarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the functions of a RPOP.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To make the world better, humans need diversity.  RPOP doesn't need anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a goal structure and matter/energy.  Two strictly identical persons are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inferior to two separate skill sets.  So I was against the idea of AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiling because it seems to indicate a maxim! um universal quality-of-living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plateau will be found and then maintained until the end of time.  This would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicate the sum total of all man years in the present and future is finite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But if there really might be a (dangerous) energy source out there that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abundant or efficient, the correct course of ethics is to bask in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inferior energy source for as long as possible, and then take a shot at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;fountain-of-youth&quot;.  However we might miss out entirely on this shot if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI is programmed only to tile and to ignore this possibility.  If an AGI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to maximize a finite value, it won't process the infinity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Consider an island slowly falling into the ocean.  For the inhabitants,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ethics really should be subjective and selfish.  Now consider the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; island rising from the ocean.  Human rights emerge as a possibility.  If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollute our immediate surroundings with AGI-tiled (better) energy r! ivals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have turned what appeared to be a positive sum ethical environment into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero-sum free for all game of machivellian survival.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &quot;All great things bring about there own destruction through an act of self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcoming&quot;.  They don't get saved by AGI.  Beyond providing physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sustinence essentials, I don't see how else an AGI can really help us.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; faculties of pleas! ure and pain (in all forms we experience them as).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extends across sentient entities in existence. The asymetric way we should

<em>&gt; &gt; value entities in existence much more highly than seemingly identical (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; often superior) entities we could create, is because: In the absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conscious entities in the universe, morality is relative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ethical behaviour does not apply to the sum total of all present and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; future conscious entities in our future light-cone. It only applies to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sum total of all present consc! ious entities in our future light-cone. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an AGI kills us to make room for one trillion humans, and then creates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans, the correct future ethical judgement of AGI's actions would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upon how well the AGI served those trillion human's needs. But the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; act of killing us off could never be corre! ctly justified because at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just before the AGI's murder rampage, us 6 billion humans formed the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; objective metric by which AGI's actions could be judged (also animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 5 billion years ago, tiling earth with orgasmium would have been fine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But as soon as Nemo appeared, it became necessary for an AGI to consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well-being of Nemo if the AGI was to really be classified as &quot;friendly&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now in the 21st century a friendly AGI could only be justified in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sacrificing us humans under very extraordinary circumstances.
