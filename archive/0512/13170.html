I am entirely at a loss to know how what you just wrote bears on the 
<br>
text that I sent to the list.
<br>
<p>Did you mean that what I wrote was in the category of
<br>
<p><em> &gt; &lt;--snip--&gt;  // astute points about poorly defined concepts that are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; meaningless upon deeper inspection
</em><br>
<p>What *I* wrote was meaningless upon deeper inspection???
<br>
<p>And I am not sure what your suggest below is directed at.
<br>
<p>Clarification?

<em>&gt; I've been watching Eliezer's thinking in public for over ten years,

<em>&gt; and have been encouraged by the observation that over the last year or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two he has forthrightly stated and shown that his understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolves, as in general it does for all of us. [More on this point
</em><br>

<em>&gt;&gt;     &quot;Maximize the utility function, where the utility function
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;specifies that thinking is good&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I've deliberately chosen a silly UF (thinking is good) because people on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;this list frequently talk as if a goal like that has a meaning that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;just as transparent as the meaning of &quot;put the blue block on top of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;red block&quot;.  The semantics of &quot;thinking is good&quot; is clearly not trivial,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and in fact it is by no means obvious that the phrase can be given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;clear enough semantics to enable it to be used as a sensible input to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;decision-theory-driven AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This is infuriating nonsense:  there are many people out there who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;utterly disagree with this position, and who have solid reasons for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;doing so.  I am one of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [more on evolving understanding]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am increasingly frustrated by the observation and experience that on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the various transhumanist lists, a graph of posting frequency by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual would show a hump, with those who have enthusiastic but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively incomplete thinking posting far more than those who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more coherent views or those who may not have strong views at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is to be expected, but it tends to promote regression to the mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than leading-edge growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Creative growth requires diverse input, but mining these transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists for nuggets of leading edge ideas, or planting seeds of thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when a fertile opportunity seems to be presented, provides such sparse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payback that I and many others question whether we've long since past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of diminishing returns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we've reached the point that we need new tools--an improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework--for collaborative thinking including concept mapping,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument mapping, and shared knowledge that goes qualitatively beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the wiki and the email list.  I don't have the available bandwidth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create this or even to organize such a project, and I see it coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just around the corner with all the growing awareness of &quot;web 2.0&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social software, but I would be very interested in contributing some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and resources to such a project.
