I agree, the most robust stuff is precognitive.  That was the design of 
<br>
the one experiment of mine that came out with an extremely significant 
<br>
result.
<br>
<p>It used to drive me crazy, with my physics background.  I did all the 
<br>
work to collect the &quot;guesses&quot; of my subjects, but what I knew was that 
<br>
the targets that they were trying to guess at would not be determined 
<br>
until after all the data was collected and the pieces of paper were in 
<br>
my sweaty palms.
<br>
<p>Then I generated the random seed from a previously specified set of 
<br>
global weather statistics, used it to dive into the RAND Corporation 
<br>
Book of One Million Random Digits (the world's most enthralling book) at 
<br>
my start point, then compared about 12,000 binary digits in the tables 
<br>
and in my subjects' responses.
<br>
<p>A lot of pain later (didn't have a computer in 1984, had to do it all by 
<br>
hand), out pops the predicted correlation between run score variance and 
<br>
self-reported motivation, at the 0.005 confidence level.
<br>
<p>To those of you not well versed in experimental design, that means I 
<br>
predicted the correlation ahead of time, and the first time I did the 
<br>
experiment, it turned up and if the effect was pure fluke, then it was a 
<br>
1 in 200 chance.
<br>
<p>But what a bitchin' result!  All those guesses matching up with some 
<br>
predetermined random numbers in a book, with the only degree of freedom 
<br>
being the seed point into the book!
<br>
<p>Darned if I can make sense of it.
