&nbsp;&nbsp;Right off the bat this would be hard.  There are some simple life forms that have no nervous systems but act as if they have memories in the paths they take as they float in their surrounding fluid environment.  The most successful theory to date has been that there is a component in them utilizing quantum computation.  The best explanation for the ability of antibiotic-resistant microbe strains to rapidly mutate is that they are aided as well by quantum computation &quot;cheats&quot; on their surfaces.  The evolutionary ladder approach to understanding sentience is interesting, but the 1st rung is likely to be very high up.

Here's what I have in mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently there is only one known example of AGI in the universe and that is, of course, the mind of man. As it turns out the human brain is also the most complex thing known in the universe as well. There are many key attributes of human intelligence that we either do not understand at all or we understand very dimly, such as consciousness and natural language. Supposing that certain types of functions in the human brain that we currently do not fully understand are responsible for the ability of natural language or consciousness, then how can we hope to build the functional equivalents of these neurological structures without the knowledge of how it works in human intelligence?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What I propose is that we build an artificial chain of life. We could pick out about twenty different organisms to represent the chain of life from bacteria all the way up to man. The advantage of this artificial chain of life (ACL) is that in real evolution the neurological substrate of each organism is kept and any modifications of higher level organisms are merely built on top of the old structures.  &lt;SNIP&gt;
