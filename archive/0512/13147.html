<p>Let me see if I can understand what you're saying here.  Do you mean
<br>
that to the extent an agent is rational, it will naturally use all of
<br>
its instrumental knowledge to promote its own goals and from its point
<br>
of view there would be no question that such action is good?
<br>
<p>If this is true, then would it also see increasing its objective
<br>
knowledge in support of its goals as rational and inherently good
<br>
(from its point of view?)
<br>
<p>If I'm still understanding the implications of what you said, would
<br>
this also mean that cooperation with other like-minded agents, to the
<br>
extent that this increased the promotion of its own goals, would be
<br>
rational and good (from its point of view?)
<br>
<p>If this makes sense, then I think you may be on to an effective and
<br>
rational way of looking at decision-making about &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;
<br>
that avoids much of the contradiction of conventional views of
<br>
morality.
