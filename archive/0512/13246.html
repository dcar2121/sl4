I never said from the perspective of the multiverse, that a human decision is more significant than other quantum events (unless humans decide one day to spawn off their own &quot;universes&quot;).  Bad news for you: some level of weird physics is responsible for consciousness.  Our very perception of consciousness is proof that some form of 
<br>
spooky physical effects are at play, though not necessarily the quantum-mechanical hypothesis I've advanced.  To really believe the Strong-AI position that consciousness is nothing more than computation is absurd.  It suggests an abacus is sentient to some degree and that I can make people from lego sets.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;ego&quot; you are referring to is derived from brain matter.  If this brain matter is referenced before a decision is to be made,  free-will emerges to some degree.  I don't think anyone on this list is presently advocating creating a conscious with &quot;introspection&quot; as you describe it.  And if so, you'd need more than legos or circuit boards (as they are presently engineered) to build it; you'd have to invoke some of that weird physics we discovered 90 years ago.  AGI is a non-sentient computer program.  I'm not defending free-will because it is comforting.  I'm defending it because if an AGI attempts to create a higher standard-of-living for us humans and the physics of free-will happens to be a cornerstone of what makes us happy/prosperous, the AGI better damn well understand how to preserve the spooky physics of neuronal firing patterns in our brains that reference our ego centers before synchronizing.  I think *narcisism* defines the concept of unbounded potential for the ego.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Free-will is choice.  You don't have to choose to be a god and physics will stand in your way anyways.

&nbsp;&nbsp;You can think of free will in a couple of different ways. To me, the
<br>
words free will represent the concept of unbounded potential for the
<br>
ego. It's not merely the notion that you make decisions, it's the
<br>
concept that decisions are even possible, or that a human decision is
<br>
a more significant event than playing a game of Plinko(think Price is
<br>
Right). I think that this is generally what is meant by free will,
<br>
and I believe that it is the most significant interpretation.
<br>
<p>Of course, few here would argue that such a notion should be upheld. 
<br>
Unless you believe in weird physics, and furthermore that those weird
<br>
physics are /you/, it's absurd to argue that the ego--not the
<br>
faculties in the brain that produce it, but the ego itself, if you
<br>
catch my connotations--performs any decisions. Resolving to accept
<br>
this completely, however, is tantamount to insanity, not to mention a
<br>
bit ironic.
<br>
<p>So, in order to preserve this comforting illusion of control, an
<br>
alternative definition of free will has been offered. This is the
<br>
notion that though our actions are ultimately out of our control, that
<br>
thing which we call ourselves is capable of a much finer presence and
<br>
thought due to its introspective nature.
<br>
<p>Just as it is absurd to support the first notion of free will, it's
<br>
just as absurd to argue against the second.
<br>
<p>In the context of this list, my questions become:
<br>
How might we create an intelligence endowed with the second property,
<br>
while we,
<br>
avoid a clouded pursuit of the first.
