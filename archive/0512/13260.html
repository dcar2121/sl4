You are confusing life (an arbitrary definition) with sentience (the only 100% certain definition of anything in existence we have).  Life is some sort of metabolic pattern transfer.  Consciousness is the (encoded within the physics of REAL chemistry) 1st hand perception and/or &quot;awareness&quot; of pain and pleasure.  Your crappy simulations might be alive, but they would not feel.  Yes, rods and balls neural networks or whatever, have no value.  Evolution fluked out and captured the physics of something really special in our earth-history.  Computation was probably maximized shortly after the big-bang (just a guess).  Don't go looking there for signatures from aliens though.

quantum effects appear at some level. Its not like anyone actually has a

guessing the chemistry of our brains interacts in a way to produce

<p>I think that's the problem of your hypothesis, it assumes something else
<br>
than informatics is going on, and necessary, to sentience. If you built a
<br>
replicating organism that would grow and reproduce, and exchange genetic
<br>
information with others of its kind, but it were not based on DNA and carbon
<br>
chemistry, say it were based on much bigger mechanical components, would you
<br>
say it is not alive? What is the distinguishing aliveness stuff? If you
<br>
built a computer with lego bricks and it gave you a square root of a number,
<br>
is that any different than when it is done by an electronic computer, and is
<br>
this any different than when it is done by a human brain? If a simmulation
<br>
of the neural processes, including potential feedback loops with the
<br>
emerging EM field, of a human brain within an environment were computed on
<br>
millions of abacus by the adherents to some odd cult trying to keep alive
<br>
and consciouss their creation, would you say that the sum total of this
<br>
process is non-sentient, because the informatics is happening on rods with
<br>
balls, and off-loaded onto other people's brains, instead of happening all
<br>
put together in the same place, although the information processing is
<br>
absolutely indistinguishable by any objective means possible?
