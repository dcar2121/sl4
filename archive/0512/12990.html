</em><br>
<p>Your comparison is a bit silly, I think--switching from very
<br>
short-term to very long-term contexts--but I agree that we should keep
<br>
in mind the long-term context of our discussion.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it's important to look at what the intermediate
<br>
goals of the list should be. I think the objective should be, for any
<br>
individual poster, to try to educate themselves as much as possible in
<br>
all the relevant ideas, and to contribute new ideas when they're
<br>
fairly confident that those ideas are both on-topic and deserve
<br>
hearing. (I also think the poster should take into account their own
<br>
intellectual level and general background knowledge when making this
<br>
determination.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We're in this together, and for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason perhaps the list should be more open to right-brained, intuitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestions, even if adequete explanation cannot be provided. Unexplainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notions are not nessecarily worse than useless,
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily, no, but they are in general. If they're
<br>
unexplainable, then they remain bound to the person with the concept
<br>
until the time when they find the proper words to explain and defend
<br>
them. Until then, pontificating upon the ideas is always worse than
<br>
useless. The idea might have a very high individual value, but that
<br>
value doesn't translate into valuable list contributions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if Einstien hit on relativity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by intuition, it isn't impossible that some other individual, otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disregarded and disorganized, might just hit on some clue to quantum gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a unified theory.
</em><br>
<p>Neither of those latter are particularly relevant to this list,
<br>
though, so I'm not sure discussion on those topics ought to be
<br>
tolerated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Thirdly, as the resident game designer on this list, I'd like to bring the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective to the table that elegant and robust systems don't just have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful scientific value, they can also have artistic value,
</em><br>
<p>I've been thinking recently about the value of fiction in learning. I
<br>
think that good fiction is probably just as essential as good
<br>
non-fiction. Fiction tends to give one new ideas about how to
<br>
visualize things, how to use metaphors in structuring one's knowledge
<br>
so that one can take advantage of one's sensory cortices and all of
<br>
their built in processes, so that more things can be intuitively
<br>
apparent when thinking about subjects. The value of these metaphors
<br>
can be immense. I feel that, in learning about mathematics, I haven't
<br>
really learned a fact unless I can visualize it. I've heard many or
<br>
most people are the same.
<br>
<p>Non-fiction can cultivate these metaphors, it has to reach a much
<br>
higher standard of internal consistency than fiction, and the ideas
<br>
must be much more concrete. But fiction and art can do this, too. In
<br>
fact, they can take very nebulous and unformed ideas and do a good job
<br>
of communicating them, perhaps to others who will be able to form them
<br>
into a concrete vision.
<br>
<p>Desipite this, I don't think this list is the place for that sort of
<br>
thing. Nebulous and unformed ideas cannot be discussed, as there is no
<br>
shared language with which to dissect them. This list is for
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and it just might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be art that makes the difference between a Prevail scenario and a Shriek.
</em><br>
<p>How so?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this capacity Geddes stabs at a TOE, though sometimes overwritten and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terribly elegant, are nice food for thought.
</em><br>
<p>The best way to acquire metaphors is through art. Geddes' writing may
<br>
have metaphors, but it's certainly not art. His ideas are presented in
<br>
a relatively impoverished context, which robs his readers of most of
<br>
the processes that led to those concepts. A fictional world in which
<br>
the concepts are developed as part of the plot would probably restore
<br>
this, and it would allow readers who see so much surface nonsense in
<br>
his ideas to discover what he has in mind that give them inner
<br>
consistency. His trying to present them technically is much worse than
<br>
useless.
