Justin,
<br>
<p>You have been a little unfair in some of your criticisms.

<em>&gt;&gt;For anyone who, like me, is really fed up with the recent debate about

<em>&gt;&gt;parapsychology, I want to make some comments about science and nonsense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and also make an announcement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure if you're just being hyperbolic, or if you actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe the things you're saying here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've noticed, out of the corner of my eye, the discussion going on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, and I decided not to become involved in it, but I do want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comment on this, the capstone of the debate(seemingly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One, you make sweeping statements about the conduct and membership of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list, when you have been interacting with largely two people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John K Clark, and Jeff Medina. This is silly, and a little insulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the many other members.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if anyone got the impression I was attacking the entire list, 
<br>
please accept my humble apologies.  Justin:  please note that I referred 
<br>
to &quot;the particular individuals who dominate this list&quot; as being the main 
<br>
culprits .... I chose those words very carefully, in an attempt to 
<br>
target that minority and not generalise to the whole list.  I may not 
<br>
have succeeded, but I really was trying to be careful.  And don't forget 
<br>
that I was also talking about previous debates that involved different 
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Two, the arguments thus far have had very little to do with scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conduct, scientific method, experimental design, etc, so please don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to make it sound more grand. The participants have been slinging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions at each other, in a seeming attempt to find the assertion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is uncomfortable enough to silence the other person, there has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been little to no talk of experiments, no effects or processes posited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or disproven.
</em><br>
<p>But, this is just not the case.  I spent ALL of my considerable effort 
<br>
trying to point the other participants toward the experimental data, 
<br>
only to be met with torrents of ad hominem abuse.  I also described some 
<br>
details of an actual experiment that I conducted.  Heck, I tried to get 
<br>
ANYONE to talk about the real research!  The abusive behavior was 
<br>
extremely one sided, and you do me a bit of a disservice to pretend that 
<br>
it was not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Three, most people don't believe in psychic phenomena. I can't imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you haven't encountered that before. The idea that any group is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to suddenly accept it because you mention scientific trappings it has,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and invest it with your personal authority(when to most of us you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an abstraction, a name on the internet) is a little weak, and I find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you getting huffy about a poor reception kind of unbelievable.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this is unfair.  I mentioned the serious research that exists, 
<br>
and that I had done some of it.  I and the other serious researchers 
<br>
were then insulted as &quot;witch doctors&quot;, a non-scientific fools, 
<br>
&quot;third-rate scientists&quot;, etc.  The careful and thoughtful replies I gave 
<br>
at the beginning (when I was ignoring the abuse) were then met with 
<br>
words like:
<br>
<p>&quot;psi phenomena [are] one big load of ridicules stinking crap.&quot;
<br>
&quot;BULLSHIT! COSMIC ASTRONOMICAL BULLSHIT!!&quot;
<br>
&quot;They try to do experiments that will give a more positive psi result,
<br>
but they do NOT try to do better experiments. That is not science. That
<br>
is Cargo Cult science.&quot;
<br>
&quot;In truth the “journals” you mentioned above are indeed excellent,
<br>
excellent for lining the bottom of your bird cage with.&quot;
<br>
<p>You described this as a &quot;poor reception&quot;.  I don't think so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Finally, this is SL4. In case you haven't noticed, nearly no one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participating in this argument, likely because it's not interesting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. If psi phenomena had robust theories that had effects on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultratechnology of any stripe(remote viewing for example, supposedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives the user the ability to percieve anything at any scale, when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read about it I immediately thought of nanotechnology and MEMS) it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a better topic.
</em><br>
<p>The subject came up in the context of consciousness and free will.  It 
<br>
is a valid question to ask whether parapsychology has relevance to the 
<br>
contruction of AGI systems.
