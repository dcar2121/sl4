<em>&gt;Or wait three years and buy 5000 XBox 360's (each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effectively a teraflop machine, I hear) on EBay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and yard sales at 100 clams each. Same $500k, 12
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years sooner. Like Ben said, it's really the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;payroll that's a problem.

<p>My gut tells me that XBox 360's would be more problematic for extending the 
<br>
software than a typical PC, because the console's OS is designed with thick 
<br>
layers of developer-oriented libraries geared toward VRAM use and graphics 
<br>
tricks. However, it is essentially Windows, and offers a nice suite of online 
<br>
software and hardware, so that might just be a hot ticket. Imagine, the 
<br>
Singularity launched over Xbox Live by 2012!
