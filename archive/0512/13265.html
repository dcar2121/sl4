</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Most people, in discussing free will, assume it's
<br>
boolean: either you have 'it' or you don't. And
<br>
most seem to assume free will is something
<br>
ineffable and unbounded, when in reality there
<br>
are many constraints on our behavior. I don't
<br>
think it's useful to think about it that way.
<br>
<p>I prefer to think about &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; in a
<br>
behavioral sense, by analogy to mechanical
<br>
degrees of freedom (you probably know the term,
<br>
but here's a good explanation:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.robotics.utexas.edu/rrg/learn_more/low_ed/dof/">http://www.robotics.utexas.edu/rrg/learn_more/low_ed/dof/</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;In total, your arm has seven degrees of freedom:
<br>
three in the shoulder, one in the elbow, and
<br>
three in the arm below the elbow. Three degrees
<br>
of freedom are sufficient to bring the end of a
<br>
robot arm to any point within its workspace, or
<br>
work envelope, in three dimensions.&quot;
<br>
<p>So think of that as a metaphor for the possible
<br>
choices and mental states a given entity can
<br>
have. Until somebody shows me different, I assume
<br>
a rock or an ice cube or my couch have exactly
<br>
zero degrees of freedom. They have no mental
<br>
states and only behave according to what physics
<br>
and chemistry make them do. There are inanimate
<br>
objects which can do pretty complicated things: a
<br>
bucket of gasoline can sit quietly, and then burn
<br>
down my garage; my computer can do lots of stuff
<br>
I don't understand, but since it doesn't quite
<br>
have a mind, it's still an inanimate object.
<br>
<p>Degrees of freedom begin to crop up when an
<br>
assemblage of inanimate matter becomes complex
<br>
enough to behave as if it had a self, however
<br>
primitive. It's generally agreed that prions are
<br>
dead matter, viruses are (barely) alive, and
<br>
bacteria are fully alive since they take full
<br>
responsibility for their own metabolism. Fully
<br>
alive entities may lack consciousness, but they
<br>
do have tropisms, toward light or food, for
<br>
example. Still, the degrees of freedom we find in
<br>
single-celled creatures are so slight as to be
<br>
barely worth mention.
<br>
<p>Plants and simple animals have more complex
<br>
behaviors, and animals with bigger brains have
<br>
increasing degrees of freedom. By the time we
<br>
work our way up to mammals, we have beings who
<br>
actually do have some concept of freedom; they
<br>
are capable of caring when they don't have it. I
<br>
had a pet rat named Houdini (he was an escape
<br>
artist). When kept in a cage he couldn't get out
<br>
of, he would lay there with his chin on his paws.
<br>
He was truly depressed! Eventually, he ended up
<br>
living in the cellar, uncaged. He had the run of
<br>
the place, and would kill mice when they tried to
<br>
steal his food. He liked it there; I would go
<br>
down and call him, and he'd come (he loved steak
<br>
tips). The point of this story is that, although
<br>
a rat may not have an unlimited behavioral
<br>
repertoire, it has enough intelligence and enough
<br>
of a self-concept to have preferences. Are we
<br>
therefore to say that a rat has zero free will?
<br>
<p>Now, a hard-ass determinist can say, &quot;But rats
<br>
and humans are ultimately just more complex
<br>
molecular machines, and if each mental state is
<br>
fully dependent on previous states, and if our
<br>
behavioral space is not infinite, then WE DON&quot;T
<br>
HAVE FREEE WIIIILLLLL! EEEEEEEEEEEK!!!&quot; We're
<br>
just Chinese Rooms? Ah, that's the problem with
<br>
denying free will entirely; you're telling people
<br>
they have no feelings, no inner lives, no choice.
<br>
So we are forced to imagine what magical quality
<br>
is lacking that a being with free will would
<br>
have, when any yak farmer can tell you he's got
<br>
free will.
<br>
<p>So consider humans: there are no creatures we
<br>
know of that have a wider behavioral repertoire
<br>
than humans. From helpless, speechless,
<br>
half-instinctive babies we have the potential to
<br>
become astronauts, concert pianists, BASE
<br>
jumpers, sex fiends, embezzlers, computer
<br>
programmers, Buddhist monks, war criminals,
<br>
comedians, and guys who hug wild grizzly bears
<br>
until they get eaten. Humans have a LOT of free
<br>
will. Some more than others; does a garment
<br>
worker trapped in Saipan with her passport in the
<br>
boss's safe have as much free will as the
<br>
centimillionaire designer whose name is on the
<br>
labels she sews? Obviously not!
<br>
<p>There's more than one dimension of free will in
<br>
humans, anyway. There's freedom of movement, what
<br>
you can afford to buy, who you can sleep with,
<br>
whether you can get that sex-change operation,
<br>
who will take your calls, who will obey your
<br>
orders. In these areas (power, basically), that
<br>
rich fashion designer has it all over our poor
<br>
seamstress. But perhaps there are things she can
<br>
do that he can't, or at least things she could do
<br>
if she had time and leisure. Perhaps she is a
<br>
lucid dreamer, knows three languages, and so on.
<br>
Having potential freedoms means nothing if one
<br>
lacks the imagination or intellect to pursue
<br>
them. As practically everyone is stupid in some
<br>
areas, so everyone is unfree in those areas, even
<br>
if they don't know it.
<br>
<p>I recall a story about Gurdjieff, the Russian
<br>
mage, behaved toward a particular woman who
<br>
arrived at the Priory to study there. She, as I
<br>
recall, was very intellectual (or wanted to be
<br>
seen as such) and rather an impatient type A
<br>
person. Gurdjieff was nasty to her, wouldn't give
<br>
her the time of day. He hounded her until she
<br>
left, and one of his disciples asked him why.
<br>
Gurdjieff replied that she was a waste of time,
<br>
and she would never change. The disciple met her
<br>
ten years later, and found her to be close-minded
<br>
and insufferable; her worst qualities had grown,
<br>
but otherwise, Gurdjieff had been exactly right.
<br>
For some reason, she could not change.
<br>
<p>So what sense does it make to say &quot;Do humans have
<br>
free will or don't they?&quot; As doctors now know
<br>
there are many completely different diseases
<br>
under the heading of 'cancer,' and many different
<br>
rhinoviruses under the heading of 'common cold,'
<br>
so are there many not-quite-the-same freedoms
<br>
under the heading of &quot;Free Will.&quot;
