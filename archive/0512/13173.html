For those who think that evolutionary psychology or evolutionary ethics are
<br>
the key to 'good' and 'bad' may want to read:

<br>

<br>
<p>'Cutting edge' is defined by what arguments most contribute to better
<br>
understanding.

<br>
whom, and for what purpose?
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Re: what morality is all about (at bottom) . . . Just a suggestion -
<br>
instead of muddling around with Kant's 'Categoricals' (over 200-year old
<br>
nonsense), or talking about 'good' and 'morality' as if Nietzsche had never
<br>
been born (100-year old seminal reconceptualization)...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You should perhaps start at the state of the art: what little is known so
<br>
far about human behavioral psychology, evolutionary psychology, human
<br>
ethology, evolution of behaviors (cf. Hull's universal theory for
<br>
replicators - this ain't your grandpa's 'meme' theory), cultural evolution,
<br>
history of human cultures, neuroscience related to motivation and behavior,
<br>
etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans don't agree on what is right or wrong today, and much of what they
<br>
do is different from what they say. Yet there seems to be a ing delusion
<br>
here that there must be an objective, absolute,
<br>
bird's-eye/God's-eye-point-of-view 'morality' from which such questions
<br>
could be decided, and then operation! alized in an AI to the benefit of all
<br>
humanity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very strange... and frankly, old-fashioned, for what is supposed to be
<br>
cutting-edge discussion.
