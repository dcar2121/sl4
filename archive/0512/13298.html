On Mon, 26 Dec 2005  &quot;Remy Webb&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rtwebb43@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20Free%20Will%20not%20an%20illusion..">rtwebb43@yahoo.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would define freedom as a complete degree of separateness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from any other objective structure or will.  In that sense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no such thing as &quot;free will&quot; for humans or any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sentient beings save G-d. 
</em><br>
<p>My definition of free will is not always knowing what you will do next,
<br>
and it leads to the exact opposite conclusion from yours. 
<br>
<p>For the mind to totally understand itself it must form a perfect
<br>
internal model of itself. The model must not only describe the rest of
<br>
the mind in every detail but it must also depict the model itself with a
<br>
micro model. This micro model must represent the rest of the brain and
<br>
the micro model itself with a micro micro model. This path leads to an
<br>
impossible infinite regress. Both the brain and the model must be made
<br>
up of a finite number of elements. If we are not to lose accuracy the
<br>
components of the brain must have a one to one correspondence with the
<br>
elements of the model. But this is impossible because the brain as a
<br>
whole must have more members than the part that is just the model.
<br>
<p>This argument does not hold if the mind is infinite, that is if
<br>
it has an infinite number of segments. It would be possible to find a
<br>
one to one correspondence with a proper subset of itself; for example
<br>
you CAN find a one to one correspondence between the set of odd integers
<br>
with the set of all integers. Thus an infinite intellect could predict
<br>
all its actions without error.
<br>
<p>So we are lead to the interesting conclusion that man has free will but
<br>
GOD does not.
<br>
<p>By the way, G-d? I thought Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter novels was
<br>
the only Man Who Must Not Be Named.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; individual humans do not possess a true free will completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate from the other humans in society. 
</em><br>
<p>I don’t understand why anyone would even want “free will” as you have
<br>
described it. I don’t want my decision to break into a run or not to be
<br>
completely unaffected by the fact that an angry Rhinoceros is charging
<br>
right toward me.
