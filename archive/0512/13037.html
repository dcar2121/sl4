<em>&gt; From: Michael Vassar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben:  Why would you only extrapolate 10-fold improvements in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware.  Things could slow down a bit, especially due to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heat dissipation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems, but 100-fold over 15 years still seems very conservative.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kurzweil would say to expect 40,000-fold improvements.  How 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much does the difference matter?
</em><br>
<p><p>The Blue Gene/L deployed at Lawrence Livermore National 
<br>
Laboratory recently doubled its performance to 280.6 
<br>
teraflops  - up from 136.8 teraflops from the supercomputer
<br>
list issued in June. 512MB RAM per NODE = 32,768 GB memory
<br>
<p>131,072 32-bit PowerPC 440 processors running at 700 MHz 
<br>
-- faster processors seem to be limited by heat issues.
<br>
<p>(Math looks wrong, but there are 2 processors per NODE,
<br>
giving the 2^45 total RAM.)
<br>
<p>Currently more than 10^5, maybe 10^6 times faster than 
<br>
typical commodity hardware (PCs).
<br>
<p>[It has a theoretical maximum performance in excess of 
<br>
367 teraflops.]

<p>Blue Gene/P
<br>
IBM currently plans to finish Blue Gene/P in 2006. 
<br>
Blue Gene/P is expected to be the first supercomputer 
<br>
to break 1 petaflops, or 1 quadrillion floating-point 
<br>
operations per second.
<br>
<p><p>Blue Gene/Q
<br>
The last known supercomputer in the Blue Gene series,

Blue Gene/Q is expected to reach 3 petaflops.

<p><p>Japan to build world's fastest supercomputer
<br>
From: 
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<a href="http://news.techwhack.com/1752/japan-to-build-worlds-fastest-supercomputer/">http://news.techwhack.com/1752/japan-to-build-worlds-fastest-supercomputer/</a>
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Japan has announced plans to build the world's fastest supercomputer. The
<br>
plan is to develop a product, which is around 73 times faster than the
<br>
current fastest supercomputer on planet earth. These plans were revealed by
<br>
the Japanese government today. The current title is held by The American
<br>
Blue Gene/L system supercomputer developed by IBM currently stationed at the
<br>
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California.
<br>
<p>This machine is capable of performing at 136.8 teraflops, or 136.8 trillion
<br>
calculations per second as per the statement by Japan's Ministry of
<br>
Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology. The plan of the
<br>
Japanese government is to develop a supercomputer that can operate at 10
<br>
petaflops, or 10 quadrillion calculations per second. This would put it at
<br>
around 73 times the speed of the current record holder.
<br>
<p>Near term about 10^6-10^7 times faster than your typical
<br>
PC (commodity) hardware.
