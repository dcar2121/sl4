<em>&gt; I would be delighted to reply to your post, below, in a thoughtful and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific way, as I did to David Clark at the beginning of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion with him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you are already being abusive and sarcastic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given this abusive attitude, which indicates that you have no interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in discussing the topic as a scientist, I don't think there is any point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in me wasting my time and energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, at any time, you feel like changing your attitude, to something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximating objective inquiry, let me know and I will immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond to your comments below with as much care as I can.
</em><br>
<p>Richard, I agree that Eliezer's tone indicates that he doesn't think
<br>
your results could possibly be repeated for the lottery. But
<br>
regardless of the opinions held by the person who proposed the
<br>
experiment, it seems like a useful idea to me. You mentioned that you
<br>
have strong evidence that these psi phenomena are real. Results with a
<br>
confidence level of 0.005  suggest that if it's repeatable, scientists
<br>
should take some serious notice. Why not apply the procedures you've
<br>
already tested to winning lotteries? If it works, it would be a very
<br>
dramatic proof, and you'd probably get some apologies from people on
<br>
this list. As a neat side product, the technique could also provide
<br>
funding for the Singularity Institute. Really, what reason could there
<br>
be to not do this?
<br>
