</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>Well, yes, but nothing's perfect is it?  :)
<br>
<p>The specs say you can have up to 2GB DDR memory per processor. 192GB max.
<br>
But the point of this box is that it is an off-the-shelf Linux cluster
<br>
which slides under your desk. That's the installation done.
<br>
<p>Basically, my attitude is that tinkering with the hardware and the OS
<br>
is an unnecessary distraction from the business in hand. That's why
<br>
businesses have a dungeon full of geeks totally separate from the
<br>
company enterprise.
<br>
<p>Rolling your own can get increased performance. And you can keep
<br>
fiddling with it to improve matters. If you have techie time available
<br>
but little real cash then you have no choice. But you run into a load
<br>
of other indirect costs. Your time (or a techie's time) building and
<br>
tinkering with the gear is a cost. You might need extra air
<br>
conditioning or a bigger power supply to the building. Your
<br>
environment degrades with racks and cables - but it does look more
<br>
like a real university AI lab. :)
<br>
Your insurance company might not cover DIY kit. You might run into
<br>
Health and Safety regulation problems, or Fire Safety regulations
<br>
problems. You have less of a guarantee if bits break. The % uptime is
<br>
probably less because of fiddling with the kit. It might even get
<br>
accidental damage while being 'improved'.
<br>
<p>It is up to each project how worthwhile it is to spend time and money
<br>
on developing their own unique Linux cluster hardware and software.
<br>
And I appreciate that playing with the kit and tuning the OS is a lot
<br>
of fun for some people. But developing AI code is a hard enough
<br>
project on its own, without all that extra hassle.
<br>
<p>If you already have a small supercomputer under your desk I doubt that
<br>
it really matters all that much that you could get even faster kit. At
<br>
least until your project development approaches the limits of what you
<br>
already have installed.  It will all be replaced in a year or two
<br>
anyway.
