<p>
Jeff,
<br>
<p>I have to reply, because you have both filled your post with egregiously 
<br>
false statements and tried to use these to impune my credibity.  I am 
<br>
allergic to people who try to distort the truth in order to defame 
<br>
others.  In future, please check your facts a little deeper than a 
<br>
superficial glance at a website.
<br>
<p>First, I base my remarks about Susan Blackmore's work in parapsychology on:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Her own statements to me back in the mid-80s, when she said she 
<br>
was fed up with the field and had no intention of doing any more 
<br>
experimental work in it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Remarks like this on her website: &quot;I am no longer doing 
<br>
research on out-of-body and near-death experiences, parapsychology, and 
<br>
alien abductions, but see below for publications on these topics.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The comments and opinions of other parapsychologists who have 
<br>
spent the last couple of decades doing experiments.  Among these people, 
<br>
her work is NOT highly respected.  I will explain why in a moment.
<br>
<p>Let's quickly go over the publications she cites on her website (I 
<br>
notice that you tell us we will find amazing proof of my incompetence 
<br>
there, so I think we should take a look, don't you?).
<br>
<p>She lists these categories of research, on her website at the page 
<br>
<a href="http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/research.htm">http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/research.htm</a>:
<br>
<p>Consciousness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Three speculative papers dismissing consciousness.
<br>
Memes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- THIS IS NOT PARAPSYCHOLOGY.
<br>
Zen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- THIS IS NOT PARAPSYCHOLOGY.
<br>
Parapsychology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ONE PAPER WHICH IS AN OPINION PIECE ON THE SUBJECT.
<br>
Lucid Dreams
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- THIS IS NOT PARAPSYCHOLOGY.
<br>
Near-Death Experiences
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Speculative paper: NO EMPIRICAL RESEARCH
<br>
Out-of-body Experiences
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A paper on her own experience of an NDE.
<br>
Paranormal belief
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Speculative paper: NO EMPIRICAL RESEARCH
<br>
Alien abductions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- THIS IS NOT PARAPSYCHOLOGY.
<br>
<p>If you now turn to her more detailed listing of publications, you will 
<br>
notice that the vast majority of them are either in one of the headings 
<br>
that I have marked as not parapsychology, or they are superficial, 
<br>
speculative critiques that contain no original data.
<br>
<p>Sometimes she tries to analyse other people's data, but in at least some 
<br>
of those cases she commits errors that were severely criticised by 
<br>
full-time experimental psychologists.
<br>
<p>In all of this work there is a pattern, and it is a pattern that she 
<br>
told me she would adopt, and she did:  she sees her role as a full-time 
<br>
critic of the field.  I am sure that she thinks her criticisms are 
<br>
valuable science, but the parapsycholgists whose work I know and respect 
<br>
find her comments to be filled with vapid speculation.
<br>
<p>THE ISSUE THAT YOU AND I ARE IN DISPUTE ABOUT is whether Sue Blackmore 
<br>
was &quot;formerly one of the top parapsychologists,&quot; as you claimed.  She 
<br>
did some empirical work in the early 80s, as I stated, and then she 
<br>
explictly chose to stop doing serious research and instead become a 
<br>
popularist, a commentator and critic, and a repackager of her already 
<br>
existing opinions.
<br>
<p>She is an extremely skilled paper-generator, but among those who 
<br>
actually do the science, you don't get to be a &quot;top parapsychologist&quot; by 
<br>
simply criticising the field in non-specific terms for 20 years.
<br>
<p>If you dispute this, please assemble a list of all the publications that 
<br>
she has done since, say 1985, which (a) are in parapsychology, and (b) 
<br>
involve original empirical work.
<br>
<p>You might also, while you are at it, ask some parapsychologists 
<br>
themselves how highly regarded she is.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a bit confused at your email, Richard, because your claims and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications (that she wasn't highly regarded among parapsychologists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that only worked on parapsychology during the early 80s) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrably false, and very easily so. Her CV, publication list, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various other relevant data are readily available on the web.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To save the trouble of everyone browsing through susanblackmore.co.uk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on their own (but you can verify all I say below at that site), here's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a quick overview of the facts, which demonstrate how very wrong your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestions are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ## Susan Blackmore has nearly 50 (fifty) essays in peer-reviewed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journals on parapsychology, not including reprints, to her credit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over 20 (twenty) book contributions, and 5 related books. As anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar with academia knows, over 75 publications in a field is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather strong evidence that a person is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ## Of her 47 or so peer-reviewed para-publications, 25 (twenty-five)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were published between 1985 and 2002, and 14 (fourteen) between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1990-2002.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ## She has appeared many times on television and radio to discuss ESP,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ghosts, reincarnation, and alien abduction, among other subjects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ## She has published in 4 of the 6 journals you mentioned earlier, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has refereed for 5 of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ## A number of her publications were also reprinted, which is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicator of her work being rather well-received in the field.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, I'll leave readers to make their own judgments on my and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your claims in this regard. I've better things to do, so I don't plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to respond on the subject of parapsychology again in the near future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to put it mildly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What always amazes me is the ferocity of amateur scientists when dealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with these issues.  I use the word &quot;amateur&quot; advisedly:  people who know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;nothing about the actual experimental research work that has been done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;in the parapsychology field seem perfectly happy to pronounce themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;experts and hurl the most amazing torrents of abuse at scientists who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;know a great deal more than they do.  People who do that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;scientists, they are scientist-wannabes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is pretty hilarious, given the parapsychological credentials &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence of knowledge that Sue Blackmore has in comparison to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lack thereof, Richard. By your own measure, welcome to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientist-wannabe status.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's also ignorant of the completely acceptable division of epistemic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor that humans practice. If physicists say John Doe's Unified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theory is junk, you're not a scientist-wannabe (or any other slur) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismissing John Doe's claims without being a physicist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To assert that phenomena so remarkable and world-changing as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paranormal would remain supressed because of some Grand Conspiracy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigotry by The Scientists is so laughable and sad it hurts. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see how implausible this is, I'm afraid you've just written off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your cognitive credibility completely.
