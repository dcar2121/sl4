I suppose when dealing with issues of causality and efficacy we begin
<br>
dealing with issues of metaphysics in which more than one perspective can be
<br>
rationally taken. That said I guess the difference between what I am calling
<br>
a rational agent and a simple computational device like a thermostat lies in
<br>
the complexity of the modeling and desicion making faculty. The thermostat's
<br>
'model of reality' consists merely of a measurement of temperature and it's
<br>
action is restricted to the simple goal of maintaining a certain
<br>
temperature. So I suppose that this could be considered some form of
<br>
rational agency but what I meant was the ability to model the whole system
<br>
of physical reality with all of its complexity to the degree that the
<br>
environment could be manipulated in more sophisticated ways. So come to
<br>
think of it I guess you were right. Let me rephrase what I was calling a
<br>
rational agent as a rational agent with modelling powers equal to or greater
<br>
than that of a human.
<br>
As for the talk about emergent properties and 'top-down' causation I realize
<br>
that this claim is contentious and that evidence for this kind of causation
<br>
is mostly theoretical but I think that there is something to the claim that
<br>
causation can move in more than one direction so to speak. We tend to think
<br>
only in terms of linear causation and reductionism but there are many
<br>
reasons to believe that this way of thinking, while normally helpful, can
<br>
hinder a more in depth understanding of non-linear systems - such as the
<br>
human brain.

<em>&gt; Let me clarify what I mean by 'rational agent' because I certainly am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about a thermostat. What I mean is any entity that acts on or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the environment using tools of any kind, by predicting a possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future state of affairs and acting to realize the possible state of fairs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which most closly aproximates the nearest goal at hand. That nearest goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should also be in service to a highest goal. The more rational the agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further into the future that super-goal is projected. I stipulate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater freedom must be part of that super-goal for any rational agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This looks to me like a thermostat. It acts on the environment through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (electric output) in order to achieve goals (maintain the temperature in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance) and it has a model of the environment (if it activates certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outputs heat will occur and temperature will rise, if it deactivates them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heat will stop occurring and temperature will lower). It can predict that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whence it turns on the heating it will become hotter. True, it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (heat might be disipating faster than it is produced) but agents aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please explain what makes a thermostat not an agent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You also said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has power becasue it is able to lacate its powers of causality from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of emergent properties which function as 'top down' locust of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causation. This is in distinction to the only other form of agency which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'bottom-up' causality which opereates according to the lowest level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity in the cosmological systtem and determines the outcome of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system. I hope I have made myself clear on this but I realize I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just confusing your simple picture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please clarify. I'm tempted to call that statement content-free but maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do mean something.
