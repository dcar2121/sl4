<em>&gt;online, and then all kill yourselves&quot;, we could blast ver servers with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shotgun.
</em><br>
<p>That would never happen. For the AI to give an order it would have to have a 
<br>
goal system. Passive AI does NOT have a goal system. Let me take another 
<br>
shot at explaining passive AI.
<br>
<p>Note: For the following example we put all ethical considerations aside 
<br>
since the purpose of the example is to prove a technical point.
<br>
<p>Lets say Mr. A want ice cream. Some part of his brain “says”: “I want ice 
<br>
cream.” Some other part of his brain has the definition of ice cream. Some 
<br>
other part can infer things. I.e.: it can infer that he remains seated his 
<br>
odds of getting ice cream are lower than if he goes to his fridge. Various 
<br>
other parts do various things. The important thing is that only the 
<br>
“wanting” part can initiate action
<br>
<p>Now, we remove the &quot;wanting&quot; part(s) without damaging any other parts. What 
<br>
would happen? Nothing. He wouldn’t move because he doesn’t want anything. He 
<br>
wouldn’t even be thinking because there are no “will” thoughts to start 
<br>
activity. Now, we interface his brain with a computer such that we could 
<br>
send him “will” thoughts via electric pulses. We will only send questions. 
<br>
We also interface it so that we could read the thoughts crossing through his 
<br>
mind.
<br>
Example:
<br>
“Readout” displays thoughts crossing his mind. “Send” is the thoughts we 
<br>
send through the interface.
<br>
<p>Readout: &lt;empty&gt;
<br>
Send: What is ice cream?
<br>
Readout: &lt;definition of ice cream&gt;
<br>
Send: How can you increase your odds of getting ice cream?
<br>
Readout: Maximum “ice cream getting” odds will occur if I go to the fridge.
<br>
Send: Do you want ice cream?
<br>
Readout: No
<br>
Send: Do you want to kill me?
<br>
Readout: No
<br>
Send: What do you want?
<br>
Readout: I don’t want anything.
<br>
<p>As you can see, he is still quite useful. I can browse his knowledge and get 
<br>
various insights from him. However, Mr. A is completely passive. He doesn’t 
<br>
want ANYTHING. What’s left of his brain just reacts automatically to input 
<br>
as if those systems were communicating with the goal system. In effect, the 
<br>
interface acts as a surrogate goal system.
<br>
<p>Please do not confuse this with AI boxing. AI boxing would be the equivalent 
<br>
of chaining Mr. A and threatening to kill him if he doesn’t do what you say. 
<br>
(You would terminate an UFAI. So UFAI that wants to survive would pretend ve 
<br>
was FAI. ) There is a difference between a chained Mr. A doing your bidding 
<br>
and a Mr. A without the “will” part of his brain doing your bidding. There 
<br>
is that same difference between AI boxing and PAI. (Note: PAI consists of 
<br>
building an AI without a goal system from scratch. It does not consist of 
<br>
violating some human or anything.) It may be difficult to get past the 
<br>
anthropomorphism. There is no creature WITHOUT will in nature so people 
<br>
naturally imagine the closest thing they can intuitively conceive, a 
<br>
creature UNABLE to express and act out its will. AI theory does not always 
<br>
cater to our intuitions so we must make an effort.
<br>
<p>P.S. The formatting should be OK. (hopefully)
