</em><br>
<p>Thanks Jeff.  Very poor wording on my part; a reminder not to post
<br>
while distracted or rushed.  I should have used phrasing contrasting
<br>
optimal solution with optimal approach, keeping in mind that both are
<br>
applied within a context of recursive improvement.
<br>
<p>Previously I've perceived clear statements of belief from Eliezer and
<br>
Wilson that the threat is too great, and the risk too high, to launch
<br>
anything but a formally verified and extremely high probability
<br>
solution onto the world.
<br>
<p>I think the concept is fundamentally flawed because of its dependence
<br>
on extrapolation within relative isolation from an evolving
<br>
environment.  A significant degree of extrapolation will lead to fatal
<br>
divergence from evolving external reality due to combinatorial
<br>
explosion and cumulative errors.  In order to control (rather than
<br>
merely influence) the outcome of such a complex system (without
<br>
destroying its essential complexity) would require accurately modeling
<br>
its relevant features and its probable trajectories beyond the
<br>
capability of any practical simulation system.  The only way to know
<br>
with confidence what such a complex system will do is to play it out. 
<br>
This reasoning applies both to controlling (instrumental aspect) as
<br>
well as choosing (values aspect) the direction of humanity.
<br>
<p>I see AI playing a very important part in the future of humanity but I
<br>
don't share in the consensus here that a Really Powerful Optimization
<br>
Process leads to the AI transcending its intended domain and tiling
<br>
the galaxy with paperclips or whatever.  I understand that this
<br>
assumption underlies the idea that we are in a race to develop
<br>
Friendly AI before humanity is made irrelevant by the unfriendly sort.
<br>
<p>My suggestion is that a more effective approach to positively
<br>
influencing (not solving) the challenges facing humanity is to build a
<br>
framework for the next level of morality (decision-making increasingly
<br>
seen as increasingly good) based on converging human values exploiting
<br>
diverse instrumental/creative knowledge.
<br>
<p>I apologize that as usual my post is densely packed, and I have a
<br>
close family member who entered the hospital yesterday and may need
<br>
most of my attention for a while.  However, I am highly motivated to
<br>
explore this thinking to the extent that the conversation seems
<br>
constructive.
