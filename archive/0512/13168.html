<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Obvious answer? No, since, say, solving a great scientific problem about ant migratory patterns isn't going to stop one from being killed in a car accident, which may end all one's goal-oriented behaviors. I think Nature classifies this under Smart Vs. Clever Vs. Lucky. :)

This is similar to the popular question &quot;Is scientific progress
<br>
inherently good?&quot;, but the significant difference here is I am
<br>
carefully specifying the question (for the moment) in terms of
<br>
individual, subjective good, since, as we agreed earlier, &quot;good&quot; in
<br>
itself is meaningless.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether we could all agree that for any agent, that which promotes the
