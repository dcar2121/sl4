<p>
I'd like to make three points here:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I hope everyone appreciates the irony of having a William Blake 
<br>
quote end Geddes' e-mail. Blake was regarded as a madman in his day and led a 
<br>
very active fantasy, often to the chagrin of his wife and contemporaries. 
<br>
Blake was philosophical and aesthetic genuis, by the way, though I can't say 
<br>
what his 'g' value was, nor can I gauge how good of an AGI researcher he would 
<br>
make. Its possible that his poetry has had a positive effect on the odds of a 
<br>
safe singularity, but that can be measured as a rough probability.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, I think theres a strong current of intellectual bravado running 
<br>
through this list that, when lacking an appropriate abstract punching bag, 
<br>
often gets turned on individual list members, by individual list members. 
<br>
There was a ripple of it when Loosemore joined, and it seems to be 
<br>
consistently leveled against Geddes when he posts. The objective isn't for one 
<br>
person's ideas to &quot;cream-pie&quot; the others, or for us to make intellectual 
<br>
comparisons, the objective is, at the least, that we and our children will be 
<br>
able to survive a few decades from now. We're in this together, and for that 
<br>
reason perhaps the list should be more open to right-brained, intuitive 
<br>
suggestions, even if adequete explanation cannot be provided. Unexplainable 
<br>
notions are not nessecarily worse than useless, if Einstien hit on relativity 
<br>
by intuition, it isn't impossible that some other individual, otherwise 
<br>
disregarded and disorganized, might just hit on some clue to quantum gravity 
<br>
or a unified theory.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, as the resident game designer on this list, I'd like to bring the 
<br>
perspective to the table that elegant and robust systems don't just have 
<br>
useful scientific value, they can also have artistic value, and it just might 
<br>
be art that makes the difference between a Prevail scenario and a Shriek. In 
<br>
this capacity Geddes stabs at a TOE, though sometimes overwritten and not 
<br>
terribly elegant, are nice food for thought. My suggestion on the matter of 
<br>
pondering potential TOE's, is that Occam's Razor probably won't apply to the 
<br>
entirety of reality, but it's certianly nice to shave your thinking with it 
<br>
occasionally, to keep it fresh and presentable. Big, complex, mathematical 
<br>
constructs like string theory seem to be less useful to physics than 
<br>
paradigmatic shifts such as the idea of timeless physics, which has an 
<br>
elegance potentially applicable to approaching a theory of quantum gravity. 
<br>
Nevertheless, I think string theory will provide useful lessons regarding 
<br>
massively parrallel computing, and on a lesser scale Geddes' TOE v.06-3.57 
<br>
provides some intersting ideas reflecting on game design. Come to think of it, 
<br>
CEV falls into the same camp... hmmmm.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge not lest ye be horribly maligned in existential disaster.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards, Patrick Dugan

<p><em>&gt;===== Original Message From Marc Geddes &lt;<a href="mailto:m_j_geddes@yahoo.com.au?Subject=Re:%20META:%20SL4%20can%20osscilalte%20to%20high-entropy%20states">m_j_geddes@yahoo.com.au</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;One of the reasons Marc Geddes is still on this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that I &gt;am reluctant to kick off a resident
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crackpot who at least knows &gt;how to spell and is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or less polite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not 'resident' here.  As to 'crackpot' I admitted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most of my off the cuff ideas were complete shit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Listen, you and Wilson are sitting there all day
</em><br>
<em>&gt;working on this stuff, with loads of cash and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resources.  I ain't got any money or resources and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only looking into it as a fun hobby in my spare time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's hardly surprising I was only able to come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The moral of my 'puzle game' story was that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;under-dog can sometimes whip the arses of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so-called 'geniuses'.  Pride comes before a fall.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If I remove Marc Geddes, then someone *else* will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stand out as the most disagreeable person - should I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remove them too? While Marc Geddes stays on the list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other people will feel that much more comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about disagreeing - there's an example to follow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone who dared to disagree, who is in fact clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an idiot, yet was not struck down for his sins
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cleary an 'idiot' huh?  AS I told you, I haven't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looked properly into this AGI stuff yet, yet to lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of resources.  But even so, if I get my 'bottom line'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;initial assertions correct, you're the one that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to end up getting cream pied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know what your problem is.  I started by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posting a few fun ideas towards a 'theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything' and you seemed to go nuts, telling me I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'snapped completely'.  I continued tossing out ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since no one was listening here, I eventually posted a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fun summary of these initial ideas on the Extropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;list.  I was then informed by you, completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gratuitiously, that I was of 'sub-human intelligence'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the problem?  Worried I'm right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's easy to demonstrate, that in fact, at many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regions in the multiverse, I'm smarter than you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For instance I think I pointed out on wta-talk that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*cross-time* comparisons could be performed - i.e
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between my future post-human self and your current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self.  Then I'm sure the uplifted (posthuman) Geddes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could beat the current Yudkowsky.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alternatively, simply perform another *cross-time*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comparison between my *current* self and your *past*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self.  i.e Compare Geddes now with Yudkowsky at say 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years of age.  I'm sure the current Geddes could beat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 5 year old Yudkowsky.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To see a World in a grain of sand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And Heaven in a wild flower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And Eternity in an hour.
</em><br>
