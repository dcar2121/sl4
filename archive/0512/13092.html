<p>Any happy human conscious entity. I don't see why either the capacity
<br>
for happiness or the desire for one's continued existence is a
<br>
necessary feature of consciousness in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if ve tiled me to be &quot;better&quot;, my &quot;better&quot; self would surely not desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return to my previous identity.  It is an arbitrary distinction valuing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanence of my less than optimally happy existence over my tiled happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of affairs to be.  But it is prec! isely this distinction that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separates &quot;friendly&quot; AGI from orgasmium or whatever.
</em><br>
<p>I think the difficulty here is, at the root, the problem of the
<br>
subjectivity of morality. We think it would be wrong for an AI to kill
<br>
someone and put a different person in their place, even if the new
<br>
person was very similar. Why is it wrong, though? We know that we want
<br>
an AI that won't put an end to us, that won't break out continuity of
<br>
identity. But humans don't have any real, core identity that can
<br>
either be broken or not broken. That's more or less a convenient
<br>
illusion.
<br>
<p>Objectively, humans have these moral intuitions, and they drive us,
<br>
psychologically, in certain directions. That's morality, in a
<br>
sentence. Without humans, and all of their idiosyncracies, there would
<br>
be no morality. In the end, the only way to define the morality of
<br>
various actions is to introduce arbitrary distinctions, between human
<br>
and non-human, or sentient and non-sentient, or living and non-living.
<br>
Between &quot;same&quot; and &quot;different&quot;. Between &quot;icky&quot; and &quot;not-icky&quot;. Binary
<br>
classifications that are ultimately based on some object's measurement
<br>
on a continuous physical scale.
<br>
<p>Might not make right, but might--reality optimization
<br>
ability--determines the future of the universe. And when humans are
<br>
gone, the universe returns to neutral amorality.
<br>
<p>I don't think there's any way to escape the fact that, whatever kind
<br>
of AI we choose to try to make, the decision is a moral one, and
<br>
therefore an arbitrary one.
<br>
<p>And if humans were to evolve for another twenty thousand years without
<br>
taking over their own biological processes, they'd might just evolve
<br>
away this deeply uneasy and demotivating feeling I'm having right now
<br>
about how arbitrary morality is. They'd probably be perfectly fine
<br>
with it. As it is, I have no idea what the significance of this
<br>
feeling is, or should be.
