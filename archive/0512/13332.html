On Fri, 30 Dec 2005 &quot;Richard Loosemore&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20Fwd:%20Re:%20Free%20Will%20debate">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could you say which of the journals that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cited in my last message you have consulted?
</em><br>
<p>None. And how many times has an article In Nature or Science or Physical
<br>
Review Letters or Cell or New England Journal of Medicine or Lancet
<br>
cited ANYTHING in ANY of the “journals” you mentioned? None. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider the idea that there may be some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;causes&quot; that are not local in this universe. 
</em><br>
<p>If everything caused something to happen it’s almost equivalent to
<br>
saying nothing caused it. An electron went through the left slot not the
<br>
right because of what an atom in the Andromeda galaxy 2 million light
<br>
years away was doing, and it was doing what it did because of an atom in
<br>
the Hydra cluster 8 billion light years away. For me to predict what the
<br>
electron will do I’d have to know all there is to know about the
<br>
universe; I am comfortable in calling that random  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You set up a quantum-event controlled random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number generator (the numbers coming out are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by exact timing of the decay events
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a radioactive substance, for example).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now you ask a person to try to influence it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make certain numbers come out more often.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now suppose that the first time you try the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment, the numbers are indeed grossly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skewed in the desired direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Was it random?  No, it wasn't. 
</em><br>
<p>And how do you know it was random or not? I hit a golf ball 300 yards
<br>
and it lands on a blade of grass, the possibility the ball will land on
<br>
that blade is extremely remote, but there it is. Somebody is going to
<br>
win the lottery.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did it have a normal-physics cause?  No:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum mechanics states that nothing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can bias the radiocative decays to happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to certain pattern.
</em><br>
<p>If you were to actually do this and most importantly it was repeatable
<br>
then you have found a flaw in Quantum Mechanics, you will have found
<br>
that the radioactive decay can be influenced by something, in this case
<br>
the mental state of the experimenter and so unlike what we had thought
<br>
radioactive decay is not random but deterministic. If that happened then
<br>
any halfway intelligent person would admit that psi existed and we would
<br>
not be having this debate. 
<br>
<p>But that would not change the fact that everything, absolutely
<br>
positively 100% everything happens because of cause and effect OR it
<br>
does not, and if it does not then it is random.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the exact connection between &quot;thought&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect seems to come and go, sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working and sometimes not, sometimes doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opposite of what you planned, sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fading away if you get bored and do the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment too many times.  This is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I meant by capricious.
</em><br>
<p>It’s an odd coincidence that capriciousness is exactly precisely what
<br>
you would expect to see if the psi phenomena were one big load of
<br>
ridicules stinking crap.
<br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; BULLSHIT! COSMIC ASTRONOMICAL BULLSHIT!!
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt; Could you explain in more detail what you mean by this?   
</em><br>
<p>I’m really sorry if you don’t understand what I was trying to say, I
<br>
thought my meaning was clear, but apparently not. I just don’t know how
<br>
to express my opinion more directly. I wish I were more eloquent. Sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who was the guy who came up with the theory of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continental drift?  Was it Wegener?  Is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; study of the history of science as patchy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selective as your grasp of current research? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or would you care to put, alongside your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account of Roentgen, an account of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened to Wegener as well? 
</em><br>
<p>OK. Alfred Wegener published his theory of continental drift in 1915 and
<br>
it was correct, but it was not well received. Like Roentgen he was
<br>
right, like Roentgen he had no theoretical explanation for what he
<br>
claimed to see, like Roentgen he made an extraordinary claim, but unlike
<br>
Roentgen he did not have extraordinary evidence, he did not have the
<br>
equivalent of a photograph of the bones in his wife’s hand. And I’ve got
<br>
to tell you, the fact that Wegener was not a geologist but a
<br>
meteorologist would not add to his credibility if I were a professional
<br>
geologist. It took 45 years to come up with good enough evidence to
<br>
convince people that he was right, and that is a dismal record I think.
<br>
I wish the scientific community had done better. 
<br>
<p>One the other hand people have believed in the paranormal for many many
<br>
thousands of years, about as long as humans have been human; but in all
<br>
that time they have never been able to produce, ironclad, excellent,
<br>
good, pretty good, or even mediocre evidence that the phenomenon
<br>
actually exists.
<br>
<p>People have investigated it with the Scientific Method, or claimed they
<br>
have done so, for well over a century. The net result of all that
<br>
intense effort is, drum roll please, is, is, is,…… precisely nothing.
<br>
After more than a century of vigorous research parapsychology
<br>
“scientists” have contributed exactly precisely nothing to the sum total
<br>
of human knowledge. ZERO.
<br>
<p>Just between you and me, I think it’s time to move on to something else.
<br>
