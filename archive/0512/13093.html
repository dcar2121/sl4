Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful you have to summarise you project plan into a set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major components, the key challenges for each, the dependencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between them, the resources assigned and a description of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the various capabilities your system should have will become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available as you put the components together. Then you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; label all that with confidence-bounded completion time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimates.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, we have done that in the NM project, to a reasonable extent...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some people will probably still read it and reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it down to 'they say they can do it in X years', but at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you miss the deadline you can reference you project plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and show where you got things right and wrong, and meanwhile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people with a clue will be impressed that you made a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious effort to plan your project and justify your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.   Perhaps part of he problem is that the intersection between
<br>
investors and &quot;people with a clue&quot; (about both AGI and software
<br>
engineering) is not very large ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; All of us on the team think the project has a nontrivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability of achieving human-level AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm beginning to think that the phrase 'human-level AGI'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has become an in-joke used on people who aren't clued up on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how non-anthropomorphic (non-neuromorphic) AGI is.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that it's a vague concept and it's not one that we use
<br>
internally in discussing Novamente development milestones, but it
<br>
seems to be useful for communicating with outsiders.
<br>
<p>One concrete goal we are working towards, along these rough lines, is
<br>
the capability to hold English conversations at the same intellectual
<br>
level as an educated adult human (even if the English idiom may sound
<br>
weird).  This is not precisely defined either but it is more
<br>
meaningful to me than the general notion of &quot;human level
<br>
intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, it seemed that presenting our opinions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attitudes honestly in this way turned off the investors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They usually prefer strong technical leadership that everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else agrees with; having multiple people trying to impose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own directions on a project results in disaster unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those people are exceptionally competent and good at teamwork,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consensus building and lossless compromise.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the Novamente team *does* have a unified direction, but that
<br>
doesn't mean we have a unified opinion on every aspect.
<br>
<p>In some cases where we have a Plan A and a Plan B for some aspect of
<br>
the system, there are some team members who think the ordering should
<br>
be reversed ... but everyone is still working according to the
<br>
decided-upon ordering (A first, then B) due to the need for overall
<br>
coordination...
<br>
<p>Regarding technical leadership, in the NM project it is understood
<br>
that I'm the conceptual leader and Cassio is the lead software
<br>
architect, but it's also understood that individuals involved with AI
<br>
R&amp;D need a lot of latitude to creatively work out the details of the
<br>
components they're working on.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
