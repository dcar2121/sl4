<p>
Some posters seem to be very seriously unaware of what was said in CAFAI, 
<br>
but having read and understood it should be a prerequisite to posting here.
<br>
My complaints
<br>
Friendly AIs are explicitly NOT prevented from messing with their 
<br>
source-code or with their goal systems.  However, they act according to 
<br>
decision theory.  According to decision theory there is almost no reason (no 
<br>
reason not involving a hostile entity or severe requirements to economize) 
<br>
to ever change one's goal system.  They are not told not to, nor do they 
<br>
have to be, any more than I have to tell people not to drink bleach.
<br>
The same confusion relates to the discussion of the categorical imperative.  
<br>
The categorical imperative simply makes no sense for an AI.  It doesn't tell 
<br>
the AI what to want universally done.  Rational entities WILL do what their 
<br>
goal system tells them to do.  They don't need &quot;ethics&quot; in the human sense 
<br>
of rules countering other inclinations.  What they need is inclinations 
<br>
compatible with ours.
