On 12/30/05, Richard Loosemore &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20Actually,%20Psycholgical%20Bulletin%20is%20a%20mainstream%20publication">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; She is not &quot;formerly one of the top parapsychologists,&quot; she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was doing some parapsychology in the early 80s, then became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disillusioned after a personal fracas/dispute with another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parapsychologist, Carl Sargent.
</em><br>
<p>I'm a bit confused at your email, Richard, because your claims and
<br>
implications (that she wasn't highly regarded among parapsychologists,
<br>
and that only worked on parapsychology during the early 80s) are
<br>
demonstrably false, and very easily so. Her CV, publication list, and
<br>
various other relevant data are readily available on the web.
<br>
<p>To save the trouble of everyone browsing through susanblackmore.co.uk
<br>
on their own (but you can verify all I say below at that site), here's
<br>
a quick overview of the facts, which demonstrate how very wrong your
<br>
suggestions are:
<br>
<p>## Susan Blackmore has nearly 50 (fifty) essays in peer-reviewed
<br>
journals on parapsychology, not including reprints, to her credit,
<br>
over 20 (twenty) book contributions, and 5 related books. As anyone
<br>
familiar with academia knows, over 75 publications in a field is
<br>
rather strong evidence that a person is
<br>
<p>## Of her 47 or so peer-reviewed para-publications, 25 (twenty-five)
<br>
were published between 1985 and 2002, and 14 (fourteen) between
<br>
1990-2002.
<br>
<p>## She has appeared many times on television and radio to discuss ESP,
<br>
ghosts, reincarnation, and alien abduction, among other subjects.
<br>
<p>## She has published in 4 of the 6 journals you mentioned earlier, and
<br>
has refereed for 5 of them.
<br>
<p>## A number of her publications were also reprinted, which is another
<br>
indicator of her work being rather well-received in the field.
<br>
<p>That said, I'll leave readers to make their own judgments on my and
<br>
your claims in this regard. I've better things to do, so I don't plan
<br>
to respond on the subject of parapsychology again in the near future
<br>
(to put it mildly).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What always amazes me is the ferocity of amateur scientists when dealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with these issues.  I use the word &quot;amateur&quot; advisedly:  people who know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing about the actual experimental research work that has been done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the parapsychology field seem perfectly happy to pronounce themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experts and hurl the most amazing torrents of abuse at scientists who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know a great deal more than they do.  People who do that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists, they are scientist-wannabes.
</em><br>
<p>This is pretty hilarious, given the parapsychological credentials &amp;
<br>
evidence of knowledge that Sue Blackmore has in comparison to your
<br>
lack thereof, Richard. By your own measure, welcome to
<br>
scientist-wannabe status.
<br>
<p>It's also ignorant of the completely acceptable division of epistemic
<br>
labor that humans practice. If physicists say John Doe's Unified
<br>
Theory is junk, you're not a scientist-wannabe (or any other slur) for
<br>
dismissing John Doe's claims without being a physicist.
<br>
<p>To assert that phenomena so remarkable and world-changing as the
<br>
paranormal would remain supressed because of some Grand Conspiracy of
<br>
bigotry by The Scientists is so laughable and sad it hurts. If you
<br>
can't see how implausible this is, I'm afraid you've just written off
<br>
your cognitive credibility completely.
