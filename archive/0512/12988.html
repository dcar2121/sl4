Hmmm... This dialogue is getting rather silly, although
<br>
certainly amusing (according to my, perhaps perverse,
<br>
taste)...

</em><br>
<p>Hmmm...
<br>
<p>FWIW, I will give my personal reaction to the writing
<br>
and thinking of these two very interesting individuals.
<br>
<p>First of all: Clearly, Marc is a highly intelligent person
<br>
and not an &quot;idiot.&quot;
<br>
<p>He has, in my view, posted a few really idiotic
<br>
statements on this list.  But so have I (though
<br>
not as many, IMO), and so
<br>
has Eliezer, though we each have our own particular
<br>
variants of idiotic-ness.
<br>
<p>I do find that the signal-to-noise ratio in Geddes's
<br>
posts is disturbingly low sometimes.  On the other
<br>
hand I have also observed a number of deep
<br>
philosophical insights in some of his posts, though
<br>
often obscured by a confusing style of presentation.
<br>
<p>It's worth remembering here that
<br>
what a thinker is remembered for is, usually, their BEST
<br>
thoughts, not their worst or even their average thoughts.
<br>
<p>I have seen no evidence one way or another about
<br>
Geddes's technical work, but I have a feeling he
<br>
could be a really good *philosopher* if he approached
<br>
the task of philosophizing more slowly and
<br>
systematically.
<br>
<p>I also have seen no evidence about Eliezer's technical
<br>
work, except the Flare language which was IMO pretty
<br>
poor.  However, I have seen plenty of evidence that
<br>
Eliezer's technical *ability* is very large.  And, so far I
<br>
have been vastly more impressed
<br>
with Eliezer than with Geddes as a philosopher.  Eliezer's
<br>
points may have been simpler and less encompassing
<br>
than the ones Geddes has tried to make, but he has
<br>
made them very clearly and convincingly.
<br>
<p>Eliezer's philosophical essays did serve to convince me
<br>
that Friendly AI is really, really hard.  I always knew it
<br>
was hard, but not THAT hard as I now see it is, thanks
<br>
to his writings and conversations over the years.  I can't
<br>
&nbsp;say that Geddes's writings have led me to any new
<br>
understanding -- yet -- but I'm open to the
<br>
possibility.
