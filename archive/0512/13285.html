[Remy Webb] If all energy/matter is recycled, reborn, and reused then
<br>
tautologically speaking how is a more complex lifeform which replaces us
<br>
inherently wrong in destroying us?
<br>
<p>the concept of &quot;inherently wrong&quot; is unqualified.  Is &quot;survival of the
<br>
fittest&quot; inherently wrong?  Is the sum of the angles of a triangle equal to
<br>
180 degrees inherently wrong?  (imo) No, the animal kingdom has operated
<br>
without our moral judgement of right or wrong long before we had an opinion
<br>
(or awareness of it) - and the topology of the surface in question will
<br>
determine the possible angular measure of any set of triangles.
<br>
<p>if &quot;destroying us&quot; is conceptually similar to a database record deletion,
<br>
then it may be a naturally occurring feature of the larger system in which
<br>
this event takes place.  There may be transaction logs that still record the
<br>
insert and update events which could be used to reconstruct the life cycle
<br>
of that record.  Similarly a &quot;more complex lifeform&quot; may have the resources
<br>
to arbitrarily resume &quot;us&quot; at any point along that lifecycle - effectively
<br>
undestroying the state of information which records our existance.  (think
<br>
of a backup restore after a system crash)  It does not matter whether this
<br>
happens or not because we would have no influence over its 'right or
<br>
wrong'-ness in either case.
<br>
<p>[Remy Webb] What phase are we in within this consciousness organization
<br>
modality?
<br>
<p>I don't believe we are necessarily all within the same organization any more
<br>
than every employee of a large company is within the same department or at
<br>
the same level of the org chart.  Some individual conciousness encompass a
<br>
wide/shallow range, while others are narrow/deep.  If the question attempts
<br>
to measure the mean consciousness of humanity, then I would ask you to bound
<br>
the ranges of lowest and highest measures - Is the mere conceptualization of
<br>
&quot;angels&quot; or &quot;demons&quot; with their supposed 'supernatural' powers over the
<br>
affairs of mere mortals within the realm of humanity due to the fact that
<br>
they have been conceived of by mankind?  Or are we talking about the
<br>
&quot;everyday&quot; version of human v1.0 who goes to work everyday, in which the
<br>
readers of this list are a possible exception?  Or are &quot;we&quot; specifically the
<br>
readers of this list?  I'm sure the &quot;phase&quot; would be depend on your
<br>
intention.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;[Remy Webb] In context, is there truly such a thing as death?
<br>
<p>death as an end of information, or the end of a particular viewpoint of
<br>
processing information?  If the hardware currently running my
<br>
personality/perspective software is destroyed without a backup copy of that
<br>
software, then the record of experience probably continues as a ripple of
<br>
cause and effective throughout the medium of this universe - but the ability
<br>
for new information to be processed by the sum of my neural net programming
<br>
is lost as surely as the current state of my computer's RAM is lost if I
<br>
unplug the electricity.  Is my current sense of &quot;self&quot; merely a node in a
<br>
more vast network of rendundant storage?  (either parallel universes in
<br>
quantum flux, waiting for the collapse of a wave equation, or one of many
<br>
serialized instances of a base object class)  Again, in either case my
<br>
current working knowledge is not impacted by the &quot;reality&quot; of the underlying
<br>
implementation.  Referring back to the &quot;more complex lifeform&quot; may require
<br>
the belief in a 'soul' or some other containing object to manage state
<br>
between instances or across redundancies.  Referring back to the notion of
<br>
&quot;phases&quot; of conciousness, the meaning of death would be dependant on the
<br>
context of consciousness being extinguished or removed from the
<br>
computational resources in question.
<br>
<p>BTW, is there a preference on this list for top or bottom posting?  Or is it
<br>
normal to mix quotes and replies throughout the body of a post?  It seems
<br>
easier to mix in a multi-question thread than to lump together many out of
<br>
context responses.
<br>
<p>fwiw:  no &quot;join&quot; post - I figured I'd just jump in and get to know everyone
<br>
through interaction.
