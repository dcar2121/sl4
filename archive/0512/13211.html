<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Jef,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I still find this confusing. If humans agument and amplify their intelligence using technology, they *will be* AIs. That is, a significant portion of our intelligence will be 'artificial'. The only 'unfriendly AIs' would be unfriendly enhanced-humans and the pure machines with near parity. This scenario isn't much different than the present scenario: humans threatening humans, and advanced technology being able to harm humans, but overall the balance of powers and human control over 'pure machines' (with less than human intelligence) keeping any existential catastrophe at bay.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, some of us think that the risk of unfriendly AI is
<br>
so great in its consequences, and possibly so near in time, that
<br>
humanity's best chance is for a small independent group to be the
<br>
first to develop recursively self-improving AI and to build in
<br>
safeguards which, unfortunately, have not yet been conceived or
<br>
demonstrated to be possible. I don't disagree with this thinking, but
<br>
I assign it a very small probability of success because I think it is
<br>
vastly outweighed in terms of military and industrial resources that
<br>
can and will pick up the project when they think the time is right.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. military has been working on machine-human interfaces for years, augmenting human cognition, and so on. Of course they are also working on pure machine AI, but so far this has just resulted in narrow applications (not general intelligence). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure the military would *want* an AI with full humanlike general intelligence :) (incl. the ability to talk back, refuse orders, etc.) Considering they probably want to keep things under their (human) control, I figure that they will be unlikely to develop humanlike AI or any sort of runaway self-improver. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So if *they* don't, and private industry doesn't, and some mad loner or loner group doesn't (considering their likely lack of resources this seems the likely bet), then I don't see the threat as being that great. The military and private industry are pushing toward human augmentation, with ancillary machine AI and a tendency to interface humans with the machinery.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever the optimist,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
