<p>
It might not be so easy to control a machine whose
<br>
intelligence was based on language. Like in the novel 1984,
<br>
the meaning of words can change. Just look at the US
<br>
constitution.
<br>
<p>Perhaps language referring to objects and behaviors could be
<br>
tied down. But all the really important language humans use
<br>
refer to subjective feeling states, for which the machine
<br>
might have no computational referents.
<br>
<p>If it has no aesthetics or goals of its 'own', other than
<br>
the admonition 'be nice'. It could only know it was being
<br>
'nice' by interrogating individual humans that have the
<br>
subjective capacity. The 'feelings' to know what 'nice' is.
<br>
<p>Surely, no amount of 'cleverness' at knowing how bits and
<br>
pieces can fit together - either matter or information could
<br>
really change that.
<br>
<p>If we actually discovered what 'pleasure' was, and
<br>
programmed the machine to take 'pleasure' in making humans
<br>
'feel nice', A friendly machine might engineer for us all a
<br>
kind of heaven I guess.
<br>
<p>But perhaps a better goal, rather than friendliness, might
<br>
be to strive to make humans wise. Even if most people
<br>
'prefer' their delusions. 'Prefer' their gods and their
<br>
prejudices. Even if they don't actually 'like' the truth or
<br>
wisdom very much.
<br>
<p>Perhaps growing up is more important, is a wiser choice,
<br>
than being nice and happy and friendly.
<br>
<p>Perhaps then, within a common shared wisdom, there would be
<br>
less antagonism between the goals of the machine and those
<br>
of humans. There might then be less need to constrain the
<br>
goal system - the aesthetics - toward 'friendliness'.
