For what it's worth, I'm far from convinced that almost everyone wants 
<br>
psi/magik to be real.  Many people surely do, but others find it 
<br>
scary/horrofying.  Read the old faerie tales.  They don't sound like wishful 
<br>
thinking to me.  Neither does George R.R. Martin's &quot;Tale of Ice and Fire&quot;.
<br>
Personally, I have always said that the desire for an explicable world is 
<br>
optimism.  It provides power and security.  Extropians who brush away 
<br>
complexity and pretent the brain is simple enough for uploading to be easy 
<br>
seem to me to be the wild-eyed optimists.  We know how rich life is already. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it turns out that this richness arises from pocket-calculator levels of 
<br>
computation, how much richer the potential of a computationally efficient 
<br>
universe.  The people in Harry Potter get gadgets marginally cooler than our 
<br>
gadgets, but pay the steep price of simply having to accept them rather than 
<br>
being able to understand.  Those gadgets impose the further price of live in 
<br>
a demon-haunted world.
<br>
Of course, for the 5 years or so for which the nature of the danger 
<br>
associated with hard take-off becomes more clear I have had to deal with 
<br>
something rather less comforting than even a demon-haunted world.  The one 
<br>
thing worse than incomprehensible and unreasonable horror is completely 
<br>
reasonable, understandable, and appearently nearly inevitable horror.  Real 
<br>
life turned out to be scarier, more exciting, and far more difficult than 
<br>
fighting monsters.  Maybe I do wish we lived in a demon-haunted world after 
<br>
all, but I can't imagine it clearly enough to wish for it with any passion, 
<br>
nor can I spare the time.  At any rate, I'm pretty sure my case is highly 
<br>
atypical.
