From: Ben Goertzel
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what reasoning you base this on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO, seed AI is only likely to be created by one of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations only if the major insights required for creating seed AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are made by academic researchers, who then publish their results,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are then taken up and exploited by large organizations such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones you mentioned.
</em><br>
<p>These organizations frequently buy up such experts and
<br>
such research decades in advance.
<br>
<p>Look into the history of DES (not the problems with it
<br>
but how it was adopted, who really designed it, and how
<br>
the theoretical works on it was decades ahead of later
<br>
research on the algorithms used.)
<br>
<p>Also note that that such organizations are the only ones
<br>
likely to have the requisite hardware first.
<br>
<p>So, while the following is also frequently true:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Large organizations like these are famously poor at radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation, but are well poised to make large-scale implementation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already-published ideas (or small variations on such).
</em><br>
<p>...any theoretical ideas from the outside (e.g., academia)
<br>
are likely to find their first practical hardware applications
<br>
within such organizations where &quot;money is no object.&quot;
<br>
<p>And do notice that the government is able to co-opt
<br>
small groups on occasion to derive these benefits;
<br>
as is IBM, Microsoft, and many others who also understand
<br>
this effect and who must also remain competitive over
<br>
time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since academic/corporate AI these days is so strongly opposed to AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research, my guess is that *if* there is an AGI breakthrough in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next 10-15 years, 
</em><br>
<p>Interesting:  I didn't know that.
<br>
<p>Can you offer some references or documentation for this
<br>
assertion (I ask not in order to stifle debate, as some
<br>
shout &quot;cite&quot; whenever they disagree but rather because
<br>
I am truly interested and curious about this phenomenon.)
<br>
<p>But, be warned that one possibility for this is that 
<br>
'someone' (like the NSA) is actively discouraging such
<br>
work and at the same time is offering strong incentives
<br>
for those who can and do pursue it to be &quot;one of the
<br>
family&quot; and keep such research under security veil.
<br>
<p>Again, there is significant precedent for this in 
<br>
cryptography research.
<br>
<p>[Mere supposition on my part, but it is plausible, and
<br>
this is part of my reason for wishing to investigate
<br>
your assertion -- perhaps there are clues in the way 
<br>
such opposition manifests.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...it will come from outside the academic/corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream -- perhaps by some small startup company, or else an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent researcher or a non-government-funded academic at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-prestige university.
</em><br>
<p>Al Qaeda?  Or some rogue nation?
<br>
<p>Maybe someone relatively neutral like the Japanese government....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, if there is no maverick breakthrough like this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then eventually the academic mainstream will come around, and in 20-40
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years powerful AGI results will be published by academics and picked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up on by large institutions, and your prediction will come true...
</em><br>
<p>It is unlikely that a &quot;maverick breakthrough&quot; will have much
<br>
effect until hardware increases by several orders of magnitude.
<br>
<p>And, those with the hardware will have the first chance
<br>
to actually try any such breakthroughs....
