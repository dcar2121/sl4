</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that I had done so. I will be specific.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Do you mean that to the extent an agent is rational, it will naturally

</em><br>
<em>&gt; its point of view there would be no question that such action is good?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Categorial Imperative (CI) is not a source of morality, but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of how to make (orignially, moral) rules. Any number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral positions are possible under this system, and as such the CI is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guarantee of Friendliness.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that Michael pointed out that the CI is irrelevant to
<br>
AI decision-making.  I would agree with him on that, and had intended
<br>
to explore the implications of our (possibly) shared line of thought.
<br>
<p>Frankly, it's difficult for me to see a connection between your
<br>
response here and the intended question.  Note that I carefully said
<br>
&quot;from it's point of view&quot; so as not to suggest that I'm assuming some
<br>
sort of objective good.  I am curious as to how you (or Michael) might
<br>
answer this question.  Wouldn't you agree that any agent would say
<br>
that which promotes its goals is good from its point of view,
<br>
independent of any moral theory?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If this is true, then would it also see increasing its objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge in support of its goals as rational and inherently good (from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its point of view?)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not necessarily. It may consider knowledge to be inherently morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neutral, although in consequential terms accumulated knowledge may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally valuable. An AGI acting under CI would desire to accumulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective knowledge as it related to its goals, but not necessarily see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as good in itself.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't making any claim about something being good in itself.  I was
<br>
careful each time to frame &quot;good&quot; as the subjective evaluation by an
<br>
agent with regard to whether some action promoted its goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If I'm still understanding the implications of what you said, would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this also mean that cooperation with other like-minded agents, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent that this increased the promotion of its own goals, would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational and good (from its point of view?)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, in the simple case.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting that you seemed to disagree with the previous assertions,
<br>
but seemed to agree with this one that I thought was posed within the
<br>
same framework.  It seems as if you were not reading carefully, and
<br>
responding to what you assumed might have been said.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't work out who made the top-level comment in this email, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestion was that CI might be relevant to an AI,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, another poster did make that assertion.
<br>
<p>So, if you would be interesting in responding to those questions, but
<br>
understanding that I am certainly not arguing for the CI, I would be
<br>
interested in your further comments.
<br>
