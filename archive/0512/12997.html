</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Or, it's open source?  How do you stop some human from taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;it offline and tinkering with it until it is able to do battle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;again with the Supreme Friendly AI running the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;People cannot even agree on what would constitute 'friendly'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;or 'unfriendly' behavior -- if it is powerful enough to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;any competitors it will by definition have to PROTECT itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;and, almost by definition, have to evolve to counter new threats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;at which point you cannot count on ANY pre-programmed friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;behavior being permanent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Stop here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are making a very critical and very subtle implicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumption here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, I was making no such assumption it was rather you who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were assuming that the word 'evolution' always means by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;natural selection&quot; or works as we expect NATURAL evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI's exponential increase in intelligence is absolutely nothing like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While what you said about the Singularity was generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not incorrect it had little to do with my point above,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that any AI which is going to defend itself from other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfriendly AI will have to evolve or develop in the sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of evolving capabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That this will occur more rapidly and by means other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural selection should go without saying among those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;follow this topic.
</em><br>
<p>Actually what I said had a lot to do with your original point, but not 
<br>
obviously so. I think the crux of the issue is that I believe you 
<br>
misunderstand the implications of exponentially increasing intelligence.
<br>
<p>While you say it goes without saying that &quot;[exponentially increasing 
<br>
intelligence] will occur more rapidly and by means other than natural 
<br>
selection&quot;, you aren't sufficiently defining the effect this distinction 
<br>
entails.
<br>
<p>In my case, I attempted to point out a few of the countless advantages a 
<br>
mind on a computer substrate would have over humans. The point I was trying 
<br>
to get accross was that the transition from AI -&gt; Power will be extremely, 
<br>
inconcievably fast. At such a point as the AI develops general molecular 
<br>
nanotechnology, whether or not a second AI or human comes up to such a power 
<br>
will be strictly under the control of the super-human AI. I believe that, 
<br>
while it is possible that two or more AIs could be developed at the same 
<br>
time, and some insane dramatic good versus evil battle takes place on some 
<br>
cosmic abstract plane of existence, I also believe that this is somewhat 
<br>
improbable, and that, out of all of the people attempting to create AI, 
<br>
there is one person or team that is the smartest of the group, and I believe 
<br>
this team or person will be the first to create an AI.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now you have indirectly made my point about friendly AI:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Once we reach the Singularity we cannot be assured of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a 'friendly AI' or even have any control or effect on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the developing and evolving AI.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, if you even remotely understand the principles of goal based 
<br>
systems (such as an intelligence), then you would know that there are ways 
<br>
of developing verifiable Friendliness in an AI. In my previous posts in this 
<br>
very thread I outlined a plausable Friendliness verification mechanism as 
<br>
well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Guaranteed control is an illusion.
</em><br>
<p>If so, then you can kiss your ass into oblivion, because nothing less than 
<br>
guaranteed control is sufficient to ensure our immortality.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Much like believing you can keep terrorists from taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down an airplane by taking away sewing scissors from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ordinary passengers.
</em><br>
<p>Your analogy makes incorrect implicit assumptions. First of all, if you 
<br>
refer to the mechanism I proposed for verifying Friendliness, you will see 
<br>
that, unlike in the case of the analogy were you talk about the airport 
<br>
security doing ineffectual guesswork in order to prevent disaster, i'm 
<br>
talking about putting the passengers to sleep, reading through their 
<br>
memories to check out their intentions, uploading them into a simulation 
<br>
where they think they are boarding the plane for real and watch to make sure 
<br>
they don't do anything bad, and then waking them back up again without them 
<br>
even knowing it happened...
<br>
<p>How many terrorists get by this time?
