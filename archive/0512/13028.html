Jeff Allbright:   I don't understand exactly what you are proposing, but 
<br>
your critique seems specifically inapplicable to the SIAI approach.  It 
<br>
seems to me that the whole point of formal verification is to avoid the 
<br>
dependence upon extrapolation in relative isolation from an evolving 
<br>
environment.  Your concern seems totally correct when applied to the &quot;test 
<br>
cautiously on infrahuman AIs&quot; approach favored by essentially all other (I 
<br>
would say insufficiently paranoid but I see Eliezer's paranoia regarding 
<br>
other humans in general and everyone else's paranoia about the time limit we 
<br>
face before someone &quot;out there&quot; builds UFAI to detract from safety, and I 
<br>
don't think the response that comes from a deep understanding of 
<br>
optimization is that closely related to paranoia psychologically.  BTW, I 
<br>
have actual professional experience with clinical paranoia and no-one I have 
<br>
encountered here appears to display anything remotely similar) Friendlyness 
<br>
aware AI researchers.
<br>
<p>It is precisely for the reasons you named that verification is so extremely 
<br>
desirable, though time will tell if it is possible as well as desirable, 
<br>
humanly possible, and possible with our practical time limit.  If it is not, 
<br>
my very low confidence estimate is that extremely human-like AIs with 
<br>
relatively predictable abilities and no self-enhancement enabling 
<br>
capabilities provide our best hope, though not a very good one.  If we can't 
<br>
figure out how to control optimization processes, we must deal with entities 
<br>
similar to those we have experience with instead.  That could mean uploads, 
<br>
but could also mean human-derived neuromorphic AIs.  Others here disagree, 
<br>
but I see no evidence that anything infrahuman and no more alien than an 
<br>
autistic savant from a totally alien culture is a dire take-off risk.  A 
<br>
psychological theory about the conditions under which humans become 
<br>
increasingly ‘optimization-process-like’ would be very useful.  Without one, 
<br>
I would suggest keeping a human-derived AI away from formal games, and even 
<br>
more so RPGs.  Keeping it away from decision theory, computer science, and 
<br>
the social sciences is also a no-brainer.   Given an upload, you probably 
<br>
can't do these things, but the take-off risk from a human speed upload with 
<br>
no access to its own software should be slight.  Simplifications leading to 
<br>
transhumanly perfect health might lead to it gradually increasing in 
<br>
intelligence, but if you start from a reasonably trustworthy person this 
<br>
effect should be visible and only moderately threatening (and can also be 
<br>
reduced by slowing the upload down).
