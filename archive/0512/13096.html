A review of Philip Tetlock's new book, &quot;Expert Political Judgment:  
<br>
How Good Is It? How Can We Know?&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/051205crbo_books1">http://www.newyorker.com/critics/books/articles/051205crbo_books1</a>
<br>
<p>' “Expert Political Judgment” is not a work of media criticism.  
<br>
Tetlock is a psychologist—he teaches at Berkeley—and his conclusions  
<br>
are based on a long-term study that he began twenty years ago. He  
<br>
picked two hundred and eighty-four people who made their living  
<br>
“commenting or offering advice on political and economic trends,” and  
<br>
he started asking them to assess the probability that various things  
<br>
would or would not come to pass, both in the areas of the world in  
<br>
which they specialized and in areas about which they were not expert.  
<br>
Would there be a nonviolent end to apartheid in South Africa? Would  
<br>
Gorbachev be ousted in a coup? Would the United States go to war in  
<br>
the Persian Gulf? Would Canada disintegrate? (Many experts believed  
<br>
that it would, on the ground that Quebec would succeed in seceding.)  
<br>
And so on. By the end of the study, in 2003, the experts had made  
<br>
82,361 forecasts. Tetlock also asked questions designed to determine  
<br>
how they reached their judgments, how they reacted when their  
<br>
predictions proved to be wrong, how they evaluated new information  
<br>
that did not support their views, and how they assessed the  
<br>
probability that rival theories and predictions were accurate. '
