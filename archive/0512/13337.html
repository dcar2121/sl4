<p>
For anyone who, like me, is really fed up with the recent debate about 
<br>
parapsychology, I want to make some comments about science and nonsense, 
<br>
and also make an announcement.
<br>
<p>Science is about finding out the truth.  You do this by asking 
<br>
questions, then going out and finding empirical answers by means of 
<br>
experiments, which you then try to organize into a theoretical framework 
<br>
that ties the experimental results together.
<br>
<p>I was trained as a physicist, and for some reason I don't understand, we 
<br>
were so thoroughly drilled in this idea that we really took it to heart. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know one way this appears?  I am fairly sure that I read somewhere 
<br>
that there are more physicists who are comfortable with the idea that 
<br>
there is empirical evidence for parapsychological phenomena, than there 
<br>
are in other sciences.  People in other sciences (as well as many 
<br>
nonscientists) tend to prejudge the issue or make casual accusations of 
<br>
fraud.  Many physicists I know, when told there might be reliable 
<br>
experimental data, respond with open curiosity.  They ask questions and 
<br>
try to think of other explanations, but when they get some acceptable 
<br>
answers to their questions, they generally accept that it is a real 
<br>
possibility.  They don't often get abusive.  Some of them are intrigued 
<br>
enough that they try to do some experiments themselves, to see if it 
<br>
will work for them (that is what happened to me).  In fact, among the 
<br>
people who got involved in the Cambridge University Society for 
<br>
Psychical Research, a surprisingly large percentage were physicists.
<br>
<p>If this were just an observation about psi, it would not be of much 
<br>
relevance to this list (except inasmuch as people here debate the nature 
<br>
of consciousness a lot), but my real point is that this kind of attitude 
<br>
to science applies to other things like the debate about how to build 
<br>
artificial minds.  Frequently I find myself confronted by people who 
<br>
assert their beliefs about Artificial Intelligence as if those beliefs 
<br>
were facts, just because many people accept them.  And when I try to 
<br>
point out ways in which such &quot;facts&quot; could be open to challenge or 
<br>
investigation, the abuse starts.
<br>
<p>I am amazed by this attitude, and I wonder if it is just a feature of 
<br>
the particular individuals who dominate this list, or if it is 
<br>
widespread among software people, or singularity people?
<br>
<p>Either way, I am close to the end of my tether.
<br>
<p>I have better things to do than teach the basic rules of scientific 
<br>
conduct to a small group of noisy people who should know better.
<br>
<p>In the next few days I am going to set up a forum where singularity 
<br>
issues can be debated and investigated in a more mature form.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
