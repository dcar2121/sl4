<em>&gt;&gt;it is possible that conscious systems have effects on the

<em>&gt; The normal cause and effect pattern is that everything happens because

</em><br>
<p>Well, what I was alluding to is the posibility that effects happen in 
<br>
the world that are not random, but which are coupled to their causes (in 
<br>
this case human wishes or intentions) in a way that is barely governed 
<br>
by any regular laws.  It is the possible lack of regularity in that 
<br>
connection that may lead us to call this something different than cause 
<br>
and effect.  It may turn out, of course, that psi effects can be 
<br>
understood in a regular way, but the problem at the moment is that it 
<br>
looks diabolically irregular and capricious.  I don't want to say that 
<br>
it is *not* cause and effect, just that it looks like such a badly 
<br>
behaved form of causal relationship that it might be better to use a 
<br>
different term.  And more importantly, it may have relevance to the way 
<br>
that conscious entities interact with the world.  *May* have, notice!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;I personally have very strong evidence that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;something_ going on out there that is not encompassed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;by normal science. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you should be writing your Nobel Prize acceptance speech not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gabbing on the internet.
</em><br>
<p>Please try to spare the sarcasm.  I am only one of a couple hundred 
<br>
scientists that have tried these experiments over the last fifty years. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We are scientists, not fools, and we behave just like scientists 
<br>
should - we seek the truth dispassionately and carefully - but as you 
<br>
can see from your own comments here, we tend to be treated with 
<br>
something less than respect.  After a while, many of us start to feel 
<br>
like doing something else and not bothering until the world becomes a 
<br>
little more mature about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I don't care to try to justify this to anyone else anymore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh dear that could be a problem, the Nobel Prize committee prefers it if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists can justify their results. Perhaps you’d better cancel that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reservation to Stockholm.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>No need to worry, I won't be going there as a parapsychologist.  Not the 
<br>
first couple of times, anyhow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;because the eventual response from skeptics is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;experimenter deceipt is a satisfactory explanation for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;results that I got, and that is rather tedious if you are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;experimenter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you really blame people for having this reaction?  No area of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Science, if that’s what you want to call it, has a more dismal record of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wishful thinking, sloppiness, naivety, and downright fraud than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parapsychology. And even that is an understatement, few areas of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity has proven itself to be less productive than parapsychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After working hard on this for one century the net result is exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero; and I’m not talking about something as ambitious as explaining how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it works, I’m just talking about showing there is something that needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining. These witch doctors, I mean scientists, can’t even do that.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could have been having this exact same conversation one century ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in fact many people did. Back then fortune tellers and palm readers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insisted there was all sorts of fascinating stuff going on in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that mainstream science, for reasons never clearly explained, ignored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today the situation is exactly the same. Back then there was an inverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship between the rigor of the experiment and the spectacular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results produced. Today the situation is exactly the same. Back then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for the existence of this odd phenomenon stank. It still stinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can’t prove something never happens, but after  experiment after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment produces nothing of interest a wise scientist realizes he’s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running up a blind alley and moves on to something else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John K Clark         
</em><br>
<p>Now, what you have done, John, is to produce the reaction that I was 
<br>
referring to (I have heard those same words spoken by many other 
<br>
skeptics), and the most significant feature of your words is that .... 
<br>
they are just downright empirically wrong.  Unlike a real scientist, who 
<br>
would check their facts before making a statement such as the one above, 
<br>
you have laid out a version of reality that you would *prefer* to be 
<br>
true, rather than the one that actually is true.
<br>
<p>The situation is this.  Some parapsychologists have done carefully 
<br>
controlled, repeatable experiments that demonstrate the existence of 
<br>
certain effects that appear to be inexplicable by current laws.  They 
<br>
publish these results in journals, they meet and discuss them at 
<br>
conferences, and they try to find new experiments they can do that will 
<br>
probe deeper.  You can find these results in such journals as:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Journal of Parapsychology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological Bulletin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;European Journal of Parapsychology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of Parapsychology
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research
<br>
<p>... and, these days, probably many others, but these are the only ones I 
<br>
can vouch for from personal knowledge.
<br>
<p>Your statement that &quot;experiment after experiment produces nothing of 
<br>
interest&quot;, your use of the words &quot;witch doctor&quot; to describe skillful, 
<br>
dedicated scientists, and comments like &quot;It still stinks today&quot; really 
<br>
do not contribute to informed debate.
<br>
<p>For what it is worth, though, I met a friend of mine when I was a 
<br>
skeptical 21-year old physicist, and when he told me he had done some 
<br>
psi experiments, I scoffed mercifully and said all the things you said 
<br>
above.  He challenged me to put my credibility where my mouth was, and I 
<br>
was stung enough that I did.
<br>
<p>At the end of the day, though, it is frustrating to work in a 
<br>
theoretical vacuum.  You can get experiments to work, but when you try 
<br>
to pin it down, it doesn't behave in a way that I could ever make sense 
<br>
of.  I did my best to find a theoretical foundation, but with no luck.
<br>
