From: Brandon Reinhart &lt;<a href="mailto:transcend@extropica.com?Subject=Re:%20Transhumanist%20Community">transcend@extropica.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<em>&gt; As far as I can tell, neither the WTA nor the Extropy Institute have public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web forums. Instead, the two organizations rely on majordomo style email
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists to facilitate communication. In my opinion this is a mistake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, forums are more easily accessible than email lists. [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, forums are potentially less &quot;hostile&quot; than email discussion lists.
</em><br>
<p>Blogs, e-mailing lists, and web bulletin boards are all forums that (I
<br>
theorize) don't offer a good return for authors who have a high level
<br>
of expertise in a given subject area. It's not very entertaining to
<br>
have to take a purely educative stance in one's posting simply because
<br>
one knows so much more about a subject than everyone else. Unless one
<br>
expects replies to be interesting and enriching, one won't take the
<br>
time to post. So (my theory predicts that, and I have experience
<br>
personally) most active blogs end up being on subjects that the author
<br>
has limited expertise and lots of interest in, and comments (and
<br>
bulletin boards) are populated with people with even less expertise,
<br>
but still high levels of interest (and often of high intelligence and
<br>
literacy). There's an additional skew towards topics that are highly
<br>
subjective, since discussion is always plentiful on them, as opposed
<br>
to highly technical topics, since those often come down to simple
<br>
factual questions.
<br>
<p>Since futurism is a highly technical and not very subjective topic,
<br>
there's a large bias against the success of any amateur-friendly forum
<br>
on the topic.
<br>
<p>I think an identification of topics that don't require a lot of
<br>
expertise to comprehend and have a lot of room for people to have
<br>
differing opinions, room to have subjective, noisy, (and largely
<br>
pointless) debate about, would help to provide the raw fodder for
<br>
those (like me) that wish to start a public, amateur-friendly
<br>
discussion. While rehashing basic points of this or that subtopic over
<br>
and over again with slight variations may be distasteful and pointless
<br>
to those with real expertise in the subject, this is what real web
<br>
discussion looks like. It's what we're going to have to foster if we
<br>
want to gain any sort of visibility through the method.
<br>
<p>Right now the only topic I've identified in this area is the
<br>
intersection of morality and the singularity, which is certainly hairy
<br>
enough, but which people don't tend to have clear opinions on one way
<br>
or another, and is probably to rarified to foster good discussion on a
<br>
large scale.
<br>
<p>Life extension seems to be a much more fertile topic by these
<br>
criteria. People often have immediate and strong opinions and
<br>
questions about the implications of life extension tech. It's a much
<br>
more concrete topic for most people. And while it's not really
<br>
directly related to an AI-fueled singularity, it certainly can make
<br>
one understand on a visceral level the magnitude and scope of the
<br>
coming technological changes, and can certainly open one's mind to the
<br>
idea that some highly technical and abstract causes could be the most
<br>
important causes to support presently.
