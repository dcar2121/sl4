Subject: [extropy-chat] Transhumanist Community

<br>
<p><p>I am speaking as a relatively new transhumanist. Those of you who are long
<br>
standing, highly active members of this community should not be offended by
<br>
my comments. I do not intend to indict or insult.
<br>
<p>-
<br>
<p>It seems to me that transhumanist community is in a sorry state. When I look
<br>
at sites that are well known to transhumanists, I see very low rates of
<br>
participation and conversion.
<br>
<p>Some thoughts on possible changes, improvements, and mistakes:
<br>
<p>1. Favoring email lists instead of open forums.
<br>
<p>As far as I can tell, neither the WTA nor the Extropy Institute have public
<br>
web forums. Instead, the two organizations rely on majordomo style email
<br>
lists to facilitate communication. In my opinion this is a mistake.
<br>
<p>First, forums are more easily accessible than email lists. Any forum with a
<br>
modern thread view and search facility provides a simple UI for quickly
<br>
reading up on the latest discussion. If a reader wants to convert to
<br>
participant, they are probably more familiar with the account creation and
<br>
activation process of the major forum kits than majordomo, which is a
<br>
relatively aged piece of software.
<br>
<p>Second, forums are potentially less &quot;hostile&quot; than email discussion lists.
<br>
The email discussion list pushes data to the reader. Busy lists push so much
<br>
discussion as to be unusable in real-time. Users have to be fairly
<br>
interface-savvy in order to either A) filter the list into a separate folder
<br>
in their email client or B) request the server send a digest. I suspect that
<br>
the rapid-push nature of email lists could even alienate certain users in
<br>
the &quot;unwanted email == spam&quot; environment we live in today. While it is
<br>
probably reasonable to assume that most transhumanists are highly
<br>
computer-literate, it is no reason to make quality transhumanist discussion
<br>
only comfortably accessible to the class of individuals who are
<br>
computer-literate.
<br>
<p>Certainly, forums take more work to maintain, generally, than email lists.
<br>
The lowered barrier to accessibility means a somewhat lower signal-to-noise
<br>
ratio. Forums have to be monitored and abusive users have to be silenced.
<br>
Nonetheless, forums are very familiar to most web users, even at very low
<br>
levels of computer-literacy.
<br>
<p>Computer literacy is not, in my opinion, a prerequisite to being
<br>
transhumanist. After all, we extropians believe that art, music, and culture
<br>
is an integral part to creating a Nice Place To Live and many artists aren't
<br>
necessarily going to understand how to interact with majordomo, etc.
<br>
<p>2. Not having any community at all.
<br>
<p>I'm _amazed_ that the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence has
<br>
no forum what-so-ever. SIAI interests do maintain the SL4 mailing list but
<br>
it is clearly intended for highly technical discussion, not general
<br>
evangelism or community building. The SIAI seems to greatly desire an
<br>
increased audience for the &quot;singularity is AI dammit!&quot; meme, Yudkowsky's
<br>
philosophies in FAI and AGI construction, etc. Get a forum! Let people
<br>
respond! Get someone to answer those posts and actively engage your readers.
<br>
It isn't the only, final, or even necessarily the best path to getting that
<br>
audience, but it is a relatively simple start.
<br>
<p>3. Utilize blog style focused content delivery and then direct conversation
<br>
to your forum.
<br>
<p>A front page with a blog structure is a great way to constantly push new
<br>
events in your organization. The organization must seem to be alive in order
<br>
to attract ongoing attention. If your front page hasn't been updated in
<br>
three months, people will stop visiting. On the other hand, if you update
<br>
with interesting (even if trivial) news about your organizations efforts,
<br>
people will return to learn and discuss.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, the blog should be the initial page (with direction to &quot;who
<br>
we are&quot; type of inquiries on a side panel menu). A few sites that do have
<br>
blogs have a static main page and a &quot;read our blog&quot; type of link buried
<br>
somewhere. This doesn't seem to be very effective.
<br>
<p>And yeah, I'm not walking the walk here either. Extropica is a potentially
<br>
cool name for a transhumanist-evangelist site, but I have neglected it.
<br>
<p>4. Not pushing people to community in an intuitive way.
<br>
<p>I just popped open the ExI site in my browser. In the center of the page I
<br>
see something interesting: The Proactionary Principle. What is this? I want
<br>
to read about it. It's compelling content. I click on it and see a draft of
<br>
something interesting! Posted for public comment, awesome! But at the
<br>
bottom: &quot;please submit your comments to Extropy Board of Directors.&quot;
<br>
<p>What? No!
<br>
<p>There should be a link to a public forum saying &quot;comment and discuss this
<br>
and other ExI projects in our forums.&quot; Push those readers to the
<br>
conversation. We are talking about smart people. They want to talk about
<br>
what they just read. Or maybe just read what other people think. If they
<br>
post, you've more or less guaranteed they will return to your organization's
<br>
site and check the responses to their post.
<br>
<p>5. Asking for the email address, before providing interesting information.
<br>
<p>I think that organizational updates sent by email are not as effective as
<br>
posting those updates on the main site, perhaps with a forum to seed a
<br>
discussion. SIAI has a &quot;Free eBulletin&quot; but an examination of the site's
<br>
front page reveals no way to get this information without giving them my
<br>
email address.
<br>
<p>Get with the 90s! I know few people who will give out their email address to
<br>
an automated form when it isn't required (i.e.: not buying something online
<br>
or performing security validation). It seems to me that the information
<br>
regarding what conferences you're sending so-and-so to and what research
<br>
papers whats-his-name is working on are critical donation engines and that
<br>
information would always be as easily available as possible.
<br>
<p>This emphasis on forums and community is only important because we are
<br>
currently a very issue and subject based community with relatively few
<br>
participants. A forum for an organization like the Red Cross wouldn't really
<br>
make sense, as they are extremely well established and aren't a small
<br>
community organization. They have much more effective funding-mechanisms in
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>CONVERSELY,
<br>
<p>- People need to participate more. If I pop open the imminst.org forums, I
<br>
see a very low post-to-view ratio in a lot of the forums. People are reading
<br>
the threads, but not responding. Maybe part of this comes from the
<br>
complexity of transhuman subjects. People don't want to look like idiots.
<br>
But we need people posting their questions so they can get answers, so there
<br>
can be a much wider ranging dialog than exists currently.
<br>
<p>- People need to write more. There are a thousand interesting core concepts
<br>
out there that have barely been scratched. When I read a series of articles,
<br>
I generally see the same names popping up over and over. The Max Mores, the
<br>
Kurzweils, the Anissimovs, etc. I cannot possibly believe that there are
<br>
only a handful of people doing interesting thinking about transhumanist
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p>I suspect that many will disagree with me, but I see the need for more
<br>
arm-chair transhumanist evangelists. I think there is a need for people who
<br>
can translate the concepts behind FAI and cryonics (etc) in a language that
<br>
is not hostile, heavy handed, or nerdy.
<br>
<p>- People need to avoid meaningless dogma:
<br>
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/interviews/nanomag-05.html">http://www.intelligence.org/interviews/nanomag-05.html</a>
<br>
What's with pressing the need to differentiate between the Kurzweil
<br>
&quot;singularity&quot; and the Vinge &quot;singularity&quot;? It's counterproductive. Make up a
<br>
new word or something! Its okay to let &quot;singularity&quot; go. We can steal a new
<br>
word. If the media or public, as a result of Kurzweil's book and evangelism,
<br>
ultimately latch onto a non-Vinge definition of singularity, that's fine.
<br>
Celebrate that one of the critically interesting transhumanist memes is
<br>
getting greater attention.
<br>
<p>Of course there will always be some meaningful internal conflict:
<br>
<a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0206/4104.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0206/4104.html</a>
<br>
And that kind of exchange should happen.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'm mostly a lurker, but I thought I'd post my thoughts. Gotta think
<br>
about ways to encourage people to learn about the singularity and get
<br>
involved. I'm really in the &quot;we have to push to make this happen&quot; camp not
<br>
the &quot;singularity is an inevitable result of market forces&quot; camp. I don't
<br>
even know if those two camps really exist, or are just the result of
<br>
miscommunication among individuals.
