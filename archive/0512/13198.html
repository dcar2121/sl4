<br>
Let me clarify what I mean by 'rational agent' because I certainly am not
<br>
talking about a thermostat. What I mean is any entity that acts on or
<br>
through the environment using tools of any kind, by predicting a possible
<br>
future state of affairs and acting to realize the possible state of fairs
<br>
which most closly aproximates the nearest goal at hand. That nearest goal
<br>
should also be in service to a highest goal. The more rational the agent the
<br>
further into the future that super-goal is projected. I stipulate that
<br>
greater freedom must be part of that super-goal for any rational agent
<br>
<p>This looks to me like a thermostat. It acts on the environment through tools
<br>
(electric output) in order to achieve goals (maintain the temperature in
<br>
balance) and it has a model of the environment (if it activates certain
<br>
outputs heat will occur and temperature will rise, if it deactivates them
<br>
heat will stop occurring and temperature will lower). It can predict that
<br>
whence it turns on the heating it will become hotter. True, it may be wrong
<br>
(heat might be disipating faster than it is produced) but agents aren't
<br>
perfect.
<br>
<p>Please explain what makes a thermostat not an agent.
<br>
<p>You also said:
<br>
has power becasue it is able to lacate its powers of causality from a higher
<br>
state of emergent properties which function as 'top down' locust of
<br>
causation. This is in distinction to the only other form of agency which is
<br>
the 'bottom-up' causality which opereates according to the lowest level of
<br>
complexity in the cosmological systtem and determines the outcome of that
<br>
system. I hope I have made myself clear on this but I realize I am probably
<br>
just confusing your simple picture.
<br>
<p>Please clarify. I'm tempted to call that statement content-free but maybe
<br>
you do mean something.
<br>
<p>--David.
