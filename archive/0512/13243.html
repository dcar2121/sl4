<p>
I hope I'm not waxing too philosophical on my first response here.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that a lot of this play about free will is a matter of semantics.
<br>
<p>You can think of free will in a couple of different ways.  To me, the
<br>
words free will represent the concept of unbounded potential for the
<br>
ego.  It's not merely the notion that you make decisions, it's the
<br>
concept that decisions are even possible, or that a human decision is
<br>
a more significant event than playing a game of Plinko(think Price is
<br>
Right).  I think that this is generally what is meant by free will,
<br>
and I believe that it is the most significant interpretation.
<br>
<p>Of course, few here would argue that such a notion should be upheld. 
<br>
Unless you believe in weird physics, and furthermore that those weird
<br>
physics are /you/, it's absurd to argue that the ego--not the
<br>
faculties in the brain that produce it, but the ego itself, if you
<br>
catch my connotations--performs any decisions.  Resolving to accept
<br>
this completely, however, is tantamount to insanity, not to mention a
<br>
bit ironic.
<br>
<p>So, in order to preserve this comforting illusion of control, an
<br>
alternative definition of free will has been offered.  This is the
<br>
notion that though our actions are ultimately out of our control, that
<br>
thing which we call ourselves is capable of a much finer presence and
<br>
thought due to its introspective nature.
<br>
<p>Just as it is absurd to support the first notion of free will, it's
<br>
just as absurd to argue against the second.
<br>
<p>In the context of this list, my questions become:
<br>
How might we create an intelligence endowed with the second property,
<br>
while we,
<br>
avoid a clouded pursuit of the first.
