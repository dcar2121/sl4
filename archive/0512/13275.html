<em>&gt;===== Original Message From Phillip Huggan &lt;<a href="mailto:cdnprodigy@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20impotent%20disorganized%20gods?">cdnprodigy@yahoo.com</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you are concerned about a promoting FAI, then you are concerned about 
</em><br>
stopping AIDS and hunger (among other things) if they are encompassed by FAI.  
<br>
So shouldn't a Type VII be concerned with helping all single universes (among 
<br>
other things).  You state that this would be a futile effort.  Maybe for a 
<br>
Type VI it would be, but don't Type VIIs have the ability to arbitrarily 
<br>
affect universes?  If not, it should be possible to code information in an 
<br>
&quot;evolutionary&quot; universe that can be accessed by civilizations with the 
<br>
appropriate tools.  We see no evidence of this.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm concieving of these hypothetical gods as indifferent due to the very 
<br>
nature of being, where the very nature of being is infinite and 
<br>
probabalisitic. My analogy is to game design theory, where you have ludes, or 
<br>
intelligently designed rule sets typically focused on a teleology, and paidia, 
<br>
or open, essentailly chaotic nucleai of play from which many goal-oriented 
<br>
ludes can emerge. If being is essentailly paidic, then play, uncertainty, 
<br>
heterogenaity and what-have-you are worthwhile in and of themselves, despite 
<br>
the inherent risks and sufferings, or at least its possible our theoretical 
<br>
deadbeat deities see existence as such. Furthermore, in an infinite 
<br>
multiverse, its impossible to affect individual, that is finitely defined 
<br>
universes, in any consistent manner, because the trillion universes you step 
<br>
into and save are going to be a drop in the bucket against infinity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I don't see how the depth of our philosophy can advance.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will when the depth of our philosophy advances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nietzsche forwarded some details of how a god should live; a being with 100% 
</em><br>
free-will.  He didn't know how to get there.  The problem is that the Type 
<br>
VIIs you describe have no reason to create multiverses in the first place, if 
<br>
they are so much more advanced than we are.  If they do create universes with 
<br>
conscious observers, we know to judge the benevolence of their actions 
<br>
measured using utilitarianism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;create&quot; is problematic because that implies intelligent design in the 
<br>
explicit sense, rather than having conscious observers be an emergent 
<br>
phenomena. I'm saying maybe the &quot;program&quot; just runs, spawning universes with 
<br>
black holes spawning new universes until everntually you get more complex 
<br>
universes with life, intelligence and so on. They don't need a reason, I mean, 
<br>
for a Type VII being the whole infinite multiverse could be a bit of code 
<br>
written on a sunday morning, so to speak. Play could be the only reason 
<br>
needed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Weak Anthropics and General Relativity observations suggest the physics 
</em><br>
underlying the formation of our &gt;universe is so fragile, that Type VII gods 
<br>
really can't exist at all.  Change (evolve) the characteristics and
<br>
<em>&gt; constants of our universe even just a tiny bit, and nothing of value forms 
</em><br>
at all.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, but under an evolutionary universe model, given infinite 
<br>
probability, you going to see the emergence of Type VII gods eventually. Its 
<br>
quite possible for an evolutionary multiverse to exist without Type VII 
<br>
instigation,
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At best, we find a large Tiplerian infinite energy source or a small 
</em><br>
everlasting Freeman Dyson (limited # of conscious observers admitted) 
<br>
end-of-universe energy source.  I'm pretty sure safely discovering the 
<br>
ultimate depths of our universe's &quot;oil-wells&quot; will constitute the main 
<br>
activity of value post-singularity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thats one teleology, one game, one ludes, but I'm proposing a greater 
<br>
sphere where all goals are possible, play unlimited. Tipler makes an 
<br>
interesting scenario, but theres something about its homogenaity that strikes 
<br>
me the wrong way, the omega point sounds really fun and great and all, but it 
<br>
strikes me as contrary to the nature of reality. For one, the omega point 
<br>
implies a closed universe, but the whole gist of what I'm getting it is well 
<br>
noted by the phrase &quot;open universe&quot;. The Dyson scenario implies a Type V 
<br>
civilization, which I'm sure can be bettered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until we know how many (if any) souls can dance forever, I don't think it's 
</em><br>
wise to have AGI tile a whole bunch of conscious beings.  Even the ethics of a 
<br>
Tiplerian environment will probably resemble ours more than Type VII's.  
<br>
Here's why:  there is no way for a finitely bounded consciousness to achieve 
<br>
infinity.  The tools available to an AGI bump into (Hawking) Sing!
<br>
<em>&gt;ularities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at every attempt to tile an infinite consciousness.  Once down here, you're 
</em><br>
stuck here just as a slower than light-speed particle can never accelerate to 
<br>
become a tachyon.  Maybe there is an infinite realm but we are all too human.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole idea of the inward-development solution to the Fermi paradox 
<br>
implies that a singularity doesn't need to spread out to reach infinity. An 
<br>
AGI might just have to tile part of the sun before it has the computational 
<br>
power to figure out how to achieve Type VI status. From there the energy 
<br>
sources become unlimited, and its only a matter of time (or timelessness) 
<br>
before Type VII status is reached.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you noticed how time seems to go faster as you get older? The more 
<br>
experience you have the less currency time carries, its inflationary, like the 
<br>
universe incidentally. How long do you have to live before it feels like 
<br>
you've lived forever?
<br>
