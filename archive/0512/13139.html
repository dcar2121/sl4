I don't know how I feel about goals. On one hand, I have a sort of goal 
<br>
hierarchy I pursue in my life, one that I take fairly seriously. On the other 
<br>
hand, I find in my experience that the finest moments of consciousness are 
<br>
when I'm not occupied with a goal, and I think apprecaiting that is a key to 
<br>
having good discretion in one's actions. Its possible that this principle goes 
<br>
for AGI's without explicit goal systems, and its also possible for goals to 
<br>
&quot;emerge&quot;, for a lack of a better word, from its reasoning, pattern learning 
<br>
and general interactions with its environment. This isn't allowed in 
<br>
Yudkowskian FAI, but maybe a goaless AGI would be a way to marginalize the 
<br>
risk of hard take-off. Tremendous benifits could still be gained by prompting 
<br>
the AGI interactively and learning/improving as a species based on that 
<br>
interaction. As an analogy, consider the perspective that, for all intents and 
<br>
purposes, an SAI is functionally a deity; would you rather have a diety with 
<br>
an adgenda prompting it to radical action, or a deity willing to be as 
<br>
indirect and unobvious as possible. Then the people who catch on will start 
<br>
the transhuman improvement thing going, while society takes the overall 
<br>
transition at a reasonable pace, maybe a decade.

<em>&gt;&gt; it would be programmed to take data as an input and perform analysis on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; data, it also would be given the ability to self-improve, and lets assume 
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; also succeed in making it self-aware.  Would it just sit their idle because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; no goals had been specified?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, giving it the ability to self-improve wouldn't do anyone any good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if it didn't have a goal to improve itself towards. (Maybe it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;start to perform self-modification at random, if it was specifically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;designed to do so - but random changes would most likely just break
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things, and even &quot;conduct random changes in your own code&quot; is a goal.)
