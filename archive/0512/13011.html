Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We could probably setup a &quot;SETI @ Home&quot; like network and garner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few thousand actively participating (at any one time) machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if network delays would not be a serious problem to such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note: I mean far more than 1000 PCs, but with at least this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many active consistently.
</em><br>
<p>This sort of arrangement would not suit my Novamente AI architecture,
<br>
because Novamente requires a lot of processing power, all of which has
<br>
very rapid access to a lot of RAM.  It's much better suited to a large
<br>
Linux cluster than a SETI @ Home type arrangement, at least for core
<br>
cognitive processign.  However, a widely distributed network a la SETI
<br>
@ Home could potentially be used for some particular kinds of
<br>
Novamente processing, as an additional portion of the underlying
<br>
hardware architecture.
<br>
<p>I estimate that with a 3-5 year development effort by a team of 5-8
<br>
expert AI programmer/scientists (like my current Novamente development
<br>
team), we could have a human-level &quot;artificial child&quot;, running on a
<br>
~200-500 PC cluster.  Another 5-10 years could viably yield an
<br>
adult-level &quot;artificial scientist&quot; potentially able to launch a
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, though, my development team and I are currently
<br>
spending the bulk of our time on commercial narrow-AI consulting
<br>
projects that pay the bills, so this &quot;3-5 year development effort&quot; can
<br>
basically only start if/when we achieve a reasonable amount of
<br>
funding.  Which is not an easy thing to do for a project of this sort.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
