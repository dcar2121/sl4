Apologies again to those for whom this is pointing out
<br>
the obvious;

<p>Criticising is much, much easier than inventing; it
<br>
takes far less time and knowledge to find a flaw in an
<br>
existing proposal than invent a new one. When I was
<br>
first learning AI I was constantly finding new things
<br>
that seemed to work, but then as I improved and continued
<br>
to research AGI these instances where rapidly outnumbered
<br>
by finding out why things didn't work. Currently I manage
<br>
to find something fatally wrong with &gt;90% of the design
<br>
ideas that I try within a few minutes to a few days,
<br>
despite having what I'd consider fairly good intuition
<br>
about what to investigate, without even having an
<br>
external review. Frankly the days when I could just make
<br>
up something plausible and interesting sounding and
<br>
proceed to implementation, as the vast majority of
<br>
researchers do, were much more fun. But as I've often
<br>
said before, it may be fun but it won't get you anywhere.
<br>
<p>Accurate criticism is vastly more useful than half-baked
<br>
blue sky theorising. Most people do not have the time and
<br>
the expertise to invent useful AGI/FAI theory, and in
<br>
these cases finding concrete failings in existing work is
<br>
a better allocation of effort than armchair speculation.
