I don't have time to reply to this in detail, but:
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Phillip Huggan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cdnprodigy@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Destruction%20of%20All%20Humanity">cdnprodigy@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;   I notice an analogy between AGI ideas and the evolution of government.
</em><br>
We have democracy, this resembles CV.  However, Collective Volition can be
<br>
improved upon.  Eliezer's CV essay remarks that no one should be at the
<br>
mercy of another's arbitrary beliefs.  If you make people more like they'd
<br>
like to be, I think you are magnifying the bad in people too.  Regardless,
<br>
freedom and free-will are really at our core.  Having an AGI enforce a
<br>
simple Charter of Rights and Freedoms would ensure none of us are impinged
<br>
upon, instead of damning the minority.  The CV essay states that no one is
<br>
in a wise enough position to make normative judgements about such things,
<br>
but this is simply not true.  There are plenty of people employed in social
<br>
sciences who don't do much of value.  But some of their products include
<br>
very well thought out documents.  One of the few books I've kept with me
<br>
through my moves is titled &quot;The Human Rights Reader&quot;.  Also &quot;The Canada
<br>
Charter of Rights and Freedom!
<br>
<em>&gt; s&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/</a>  is being used as a model in many
</em><br>
developing nations.  Obviously this is not an optimal goal system, but I
<br>
think it is an improvement to CV.  I don't know how difficult it would be to
<br>
program an AGI to implement such a charter while still preserving or
<br>
effecting/accelerating the many types of progress we seem to have open to us
<br>
in the absence of AGI.  Earth is bountiful enough that there aren't any
<br>
tough ethical zero-sum dillemnas where an AGI actually would have to take
<br>
essential-for-charter physical resources from one judged inferior person and
<br>
give to another judged superior person, at least until just before the end
<br>
of the universe.
<br>
<p><p>1.If such a charter of rights is what people would want if they were smarter
<br>
and friendlier, CEV would select for it, so CEV includes as a possible
<br>
outcome such a charter of rights.
<br>
2. A superhuman AI or RPOP or call it what you will is going to be able to
<br>
work things out to a much more significant level of refinement than any
<br>
human political philosopher, and imposing the limitations of human political
<br>
philosophers would be akin to enforcing speed limits designed for cars to
<br>
spaceships. If you're so sure the charter is perfect, or near perfect, then
<br>
there's no problem, CEV will find that's the right mode of organizing
<br>
things. But I doubt it is. Note that Eliezer says &quot;arbitrary beliefs&quot;, that
<br>
arbitrary has meaning there.
<br>
