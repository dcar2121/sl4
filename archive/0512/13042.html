<em>&gt; My gut tells me that XBox 360's would be more problematic for extending the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It may be that the main impediment to using the XBox 360 for generic
<br>
software usage will be that Microsoft has put a whole lot of effort
<br>
into making them useless except for approved software. In other words,
<br>
they don't want you to run linux on them. The security extends all the
<br>
way down to the bootloader code and in the POST stages, requiring that
<br>
a special code be sent to some security chip or another based on a
<br>
hash of this or that.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the X-Box security was hacked pretty quickly, IIRC.
<br>
(The secret code was sniffed as it passed over the bus's wires.) The
<br>
360's may also be, though it's likely to be more difficult.
<br>
<p>A lot of new hardware is moving this direction. Fortunately, the
<br>
relatively open PC architecture has been entrenched for a long time.
<br>
Unfortunately, this is not a condition that's guaranteed to last
<br>
forever, and many players have a big interest in seeing cheap,
<br>
general-purpose computing devices go away completely.
