Then we must begin to understand biological computation at the
<br>
pre-neurological level. If bacteria do indeed use a form of quantum
<br>
computation then we need to understand this process. If it
<br>
&nbsp;turns out to be true that quantum computation is going on at the
<br>
pre-neurological level then Roger Penrose might be right after all (with the
<br>
whole quantum tunneling micotubules thing), and we will have to master this
<br>
form of computation before we can functionaly emulate the human brain's
<br>
software. I would suggest that we start by completely reverse engineering a
<br>
bacterium. This might mean building it one protein at a time. If we can do
<br>
this succsesfully then we will be well on our way. On the other hand if the
<br>
notion of quantum computation in bacteria is just a load of non-sense (as it
<br>
may be) then we could just skip over this rung in the ladder and go straight
<br>
to the the most promordial organism that actually has neurons and begin
<br>
there.

<em>&gt; I've been struck by the idea that the best model for achieving human level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI (Artificial ! General Intelligence) should be based in biology but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily from reverse engineering the human brain. Here's what I have in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Presently there is only one known example of AGI in the universe and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, of course, the mind of man. As it turns out the human brain is also the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most complex thing known in the universe as well. There are many key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attributes of human intelligence that we either do not understand at all or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we understand very dimly, such as consciousness and natural language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Supposing that certain types of functions in the human brain that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently do not fully understand are responsible for the ability of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language or consciousness, then how can we hope to build the functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalents of these neurological structures without the knowledge of how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works in human intelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I propose is that we build an artificial chain of life. We could pick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out about twenty different organisms to represent the chain of life from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bacteria all the way up to man. The advantage of this artificial chain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life (ACL) is that in real evolution the neurological substrate of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism is kept and any modifications of higher level organisms are merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built on top of the old structures.  &lt;SNIP&gt;
