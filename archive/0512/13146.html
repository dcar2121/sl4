&lt;hypothetical&gt;
<br>
An AGI is built, it becomes exceedingly intelligent, but can see how to 
<br>
become more intelligent again. This is one of its goals. Humanity is 
<br>
alive, and the AGI has found a way to acceptably co-exist without too 
<br>
much being given up by either side.
<br>
<p>The AGI can see how to fulfil its goal, but to do so necessitates a 
<br>
calculated risk.
<br>
&lt;/hypothetical&gt;
<br>
<p>Regardless of your decision theory, this seems to come down to a 
<br>
decision simple enough for almost all people to understand. Upside risk, 
<br>
downside risk, chance of success.
<br>
<p>Let's say the upside risk is quantified as &quot;99&quot;. Let's say the downside 
<br>
risk is quantified as &quot;20&quot;. Let's say the chance of success is 
<br>
quantified at &quot;80%&quot;. Let's assume it's a roll-of-the-dice kind of 
<br>
decision, a single-action, discontinuous outcome kind of action. An 
<br>
all-or-nothing, if you will.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that this is exactly the kind of scenarion which is 
<br>
worrying. Do we want the AGI to roll the dice? Regardless of how you 
<br>
build the goal system, I think the hypothetical scenario where the AGI 
<br>
is left weighing up a risk scenario will always remain. Even with our 
<br>
best interests in mind, the AGI may have to risk those interests, 
<br>
balanced against the other alternatives.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that the X-Factor, or how risk-averse the AGI is, is an 
<br>
element of choice which cannot be removed even with a perfect goal 
<br>
system. It seems to me that the pursuit of a stable and acceptable goal 
<br>
system is a different kind of thing to reasoning about risk.
<br>
<p>Decision theory, it seems to me, does not prevent us from having to play 
<br>
dice.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
