<p>Ben I've done a fair amount of this kind of prediction myself,
<br>
both for challenging but conventional software engineering tasks
<br>
and for AGI. I'm fairly sure that the tools and knowledge I have
<br>
to help me make these predictions are roughly comparable to the
<br>
ones you have, and there is just no way you can predict anything
<br>
but a near-best case. You can plan out how you think things will
<br>
go if you theory is all correct and you hit no major problems,
<br>
you can guess about how long it might take people to implement
<br>
things if they turn out to be comparable to other problems you've
<br>
solved in the past, but you simply can't make strong predictions
<br>
that specific things will work in specific time periods given X
<br>
resources. I'm guessing that your above resource requirements
<br>
meet a minimum level of comfort for you, where the problem starts
<br>
to /feel/ achievable (e.g. there is a staff member assigned to
<br>
each tricky area, the computational requirements meet a simple
<br>
extrapolation from test problems times a fudge factor, whatever).
<br>
But this is not a well-justified statement that 'given resources
<br>
X, we can do Y as long as there are no major disasters'. Back
<br>
when I was doing normal software engineering, I prided myself on
<br>
being able to make and uphold those kind of predictions when
<br>
others couldn't, but AGI is just /different/. Even given sound
<br>
theory (which is hard enough to start with), all projects face a
<br>
flood of difficult, subtle problems each of which can block
<br>
progress for effort for months, years or indefinitely. I don't
<br>
think even Eliezer would claim that you can foresee them all,
<br>
and you just can't make strong predictions about the results of
<br>
trying to traverse that kind of minefield.
<br>
<p>Based on your past statements I'm pretty sure you're well aware
<br>
of all that Ben and would acknowledge your statement as hopeful
<br>
optimisim; e.g. 'given the above, I feel we would have a
<br>
nontrivial chance of success...', which is fine. I'm just
<br>
reminding everyone else, if they haven't already concluded as
<br>
much from the sheer number of people who've said something like
<br>
'given enough funding to make my project feel serious and well
<br>
equipped, we can probably build an AGI in X years' and failed
<br>
miserably, not to take these kind of claims as serious
<br>
predictions. It is unfortuante that the funding environment
<br>
strongly rewards those who claim 'Yes, I can definitely build
<br>
an AGI in X years given Y million dollars' and sound convincing
<br>
about it; it encourages both scams and honest self-delusion. I
<br>
am glad that so far I have been able to raise funding without
<br>
having to make such claims.
