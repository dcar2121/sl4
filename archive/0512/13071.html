<p>
I've been struck by the idea that the best model for achieving human level
<br>
AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) should be based in biology but not
<br>
necessarily from reverse engineering the human brain. Here's what I have in
<br>
mind.
<br>
<p>Presently there is only one known example of AGI in the universe and that
<br>
is, of course, the mind of man. As it turns out the human brain is also the
<br>
most complex thing known in the universe as well. There are many key
<br>
attributes of human intelligence that we either do not understand at all or
<br>
we understand very dimly, such as consciousness and natural language.
<br>
Supposing that certain types of functions in the human brain that we
<br>
currently do not fully understand are responsible for the ability of natural
<br>
language or consciousness, then how can we hope to build the functional
<br>
equivalents of these neurological structures without the knowledge of how it
<br>
works in human intelligence?
<br>
<p>What I propose is that we build an artificial chain of life. We could pick
<br>
out about twenty different organisms to represent the chain of life from
<br>
bacteria all the way up to man. The advantage of this artificial chain of
<br>
life (ACL) is that in real evolution the neurological substrate of each
<br>
organism is kept and any modifications of higher level organisms are merely
<br>
built on top of the old structures.
<br>
<p>This would have to be a massive research project. It would require that we
<br>
map out the genome of each respective organism that is representing in the
<br>
ACL. The reasoning behind this is that if we start with the most simple
<br>
organism we should be able to figure out precisely what genes code for what
<br>
structures. Then every time we move up a rung in the ladder of the ACL we
<br>
already have the artificial genetic blueprint for the underlying structure
<br>
of the artificial brain of that next organism.
<br>
<p>So at every stage along the way we have a functional replication of the
<br>
neurological structures of the lower artificial intelligence and we have the
<br>
corresponding genome of that organism and the genome of the next higher
<br>
organism. Then it must be ascertained what new genes in that higher organism
<br>
are coding for new neurological structures. Because the genome will very
<br>
similar to the genome of the next lower organism this should be fairly easy
<br>
to figure out. Also because we would already have a functional replication
<br>
of the next lower neurological structures we would be able to use that as a
<br>
platform to functionally replicate the next higher neurological structures.
<br>
<p>At the lower end of the ACL each step up the latter would be fairly simple,
<br>
but as we progress up the latter each stage of brain evolution becomes
<br>
exponentially more complex. For instance going from a lobster to a snake
<br>
would be easy but going from a chimp to a man is an enormous step. This
<br>
works out perfectly, however. Say we spend one year developing each stage of
<br>
artificial intelligence. Each year that goes by going from one stage to the
<br>
next gets exponentially more difficult, but each year our technology and
<br>
science gets exponentially better in correspondence. If this is an accurate
<br>
picture then we would be able to functionally replicate the human brain in
<br>
twenty years.
<br>
<p>Another aspect of this is that it would allow for us to naturally let our
<br>
programming skills grow exponentially with our knowledge of cognitive
<br>
science. What I mean is that on the lower rungs of the ACL the programming
<br>
is rather simple and we currently have the skills to program and the right
<br>
hardware to run these programs. But as we move up the ACL we can build on
<br>
these programming skills in a fluid way. I would propose that we concentrate
<br>
on replicating the actual programming of the organism to behave like a real
<br>
one. The advantage of this would play out at the higher levels. Imagine an
<br>
AI that was based on a chimp. We could build multiple robots with the
<br>
functional replication of a chimps neurological structures and with a chimps
<br>
programming for social behavior. This would allow us to see how these AI
<br>
behave in the context of social intelligence and presumably allow us to
<br>
begin to slowly implement the kinds of structures in human brains that are
<br>
missing in chimp brains. In this way we could virtually watch the evolution
<br>
of man unfold and the end result would, at least in theory, be a very
<br>
human-like AI.
