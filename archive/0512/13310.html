I've got to say you are a difficult person to have a serious discussion 
<br>
with.
<br>
<p>I am going to bring forward one of your comments and reply to that first:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; And I feel it is stupid to listen to psi “scientists” until they can
</em><br>
<em> &gt; produce one experiment, one, just one, that is repeatable. Until then
</em><br>
<em> &gt; they are witch doctors.
</em><br>
<p>Those experiments exist.  Could you say which of the journals that I 
<br>
cited in my last message you have consulted?  Some of these works of 
<br>
scholarship have been around for 120 years, some at least 60 years, some 
<br>
several decades.  In most cases, four issues a year.  I estimate you 
<br>
would have some 800 to 1000 issues packed with about ten research papers 
<br>
each.  With only 1 in 10 of those papers being first-grade science, that 
<br>
would still leave about 1000 papers packed with detailed information. 
<br>
Could you please explain why, after reading those 1000 papers, you found 
<br>
their contents less than satisfactory?

</em><br>
<p>Well, I take your point, but what I was getting at was the idea that 
<br>
there could be some types of &quot;cause and effect&quot; that look so different 
<br>
from the usual stuff, that some of the *inferences* you were trying to 
<br>
draw might get derailed.  My comments were, in other words, specifically 
<br>
in the context of the inferences you were trying to draw vis-a-vis free 
<br>
will.
<br>
<p>Consider the idea that there may be some &quot;causes&quot; that are not local in 
<br>
this universe.  At the moment this is completely disallowed by physics 
<br>
(okay, quantum entanglement folks, I know you are going to get on my 
<br>
case here, but hear me out:  QE always starts with local events). 
<br>
Suppose, specifically, that thinking systems can bias the outcome of 
<br>
some events.  Imagine that there are new, as yet undiscovered laws of 
<br>
physics that allow global, nebulous things like &quot;thoughts&quot; to make 
<br>
things happen.  And suppose that these new laws were such that there was 
<br>
an irreducible random component in them, such that some thoughts have 
<br>
effects and some don't, and no amount of further analysis allows an 
<br>
internal mechanism to be discovered that pins down the connection 
<br>
between thought and effect.
<br>
<p>Now, this *could* be called a cause and effect relationship, as per 
<br>
normal physics, but notice that it leads to a different conclusion in 
<br>
the context of free will.  It opens up the possibility that some events 
<br>
in the world are (a) not being determined by normal physics, and (b) are 
<br>
not completely random either.
<br>
<p>Let me give a more specific example.  You set up a quantum-event 
<br>
controlled random number generator (the numbers coming out are 
<br>
determined by exact timing of the decay events of a radioactive 
<br>
substance, for example).  Now you ask a person to try to influence it to 
<br>
make certain numbers come out more often.  Now suppose that the first 
<br>
time you try the experiment, the numbers are indeed grossly skewed in 
<br>
the desired direction.  Was it random?  No, it wasn't.  Did it have a 
<br>
normal-physics cause?  No:  quantum mechanics states that nothing can 
<br>
bias the radiocative decays to happen according to certain pattern.
<br>
<p>And then, if you generalise the notion of &quot;cause&quot; to include this new 
<br>
thinking-caused effect (bring it within the gamut of &quot;normal&quot; physics), 
<br>
you might find yourself consorting with a type of physical law that will 
<br>
drive you nuts:  the exact connection between &quot;thought&quot; and effect seems 
<br>
to come and go, sometimes working and sometimes not, sometimes doing the 
<br>
opposite of what you planned, sometimes fading away if you get bored and 
<br>
do the experiment too many times.  This is what I meant by capricious.
<br>
<p>Now, if that is the universe we live in, would you say that thinking 
<br>
systems are purely governed by physical law as we understand it at the 
<br>
moment?  I'm not so sure.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;may lead us to call this something different than cause 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and effect. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The word is random. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;it [psi] looks diabolically irregular and capricious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose just for a moment that we lived in a world where psi did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist but that almost every human being on the planet, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists (and me) wished it did, what do you suppose the results of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psi experiments performed by third rate scientists would look like? They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would look diabolically irregular and capricious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS: we live in that world. 
</em><br>
<p>You can be profoundly insulting sometimes, about subjects on which you 
<br>
are quite clearly ignorant.  Do you have an epithet to describe _that_ 
<br>
kind of person?
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I personally have very strong evidence that there is

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Then you should be writing your Nobel Prize acceptance

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Please try to spare the sarcasm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No. If what you said was true, if you really do have “very strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence” for the existence of psi then you have made a HUGE discovery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the Nobel Prize is just one of the countless honors you richly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve. In fact you are the greatest scientist since Newton. And that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my friend is no sarcasm, provided of course that what you said was true. 
</em><br>
<p>If it was not sarcasm, then I accept the compliment, but with the 
<br>
qualification that I would have to do so on behalf of at least several 
<br>
dozen (and more probably a couple of hundred) dedicated, first-rate 
<br>
scientists, who call themselves parapsychologists, across the world who 
<br>
have done many, many more experiments than I have.  My contribution has 
<br>
been extremely small.
<br>
<p>You'll forgive me, I am sure, if I misinterpreted your words as sarcasm, 
<br>
given that elsewhere you refer to these people as &quot;witch doctors&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;loonies&quot; and &quot;third rate scientists&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt;we tend to be treated with something less than respect.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the respect they deserve. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;many of us start to feel like doing something else

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;you have laid out a version of reality that you would

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; making at Hogwarts!
</em><br>
<p>A complete misunderstanding, this:  you have laid out a version of 
<br>
reality *in which parpsychologists are loony witch doctors and 
<br>
third-rate scientists who have never produced any reliable experimental 
<br>
evidence for paranormal effects*.  That version of reality, which you 
<br>
are repeating all the time, is a figment of your imagination.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Unfortunately wishing does not make it so. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Some parapsychologists have done carefully controlled,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BULLSHIT! COSMIC ASTRONOMICAL BULLSHIT!!
</em><br>
<p>Could you explain in more detail what you mean by this?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;They publish these results in journals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; National Enquirer? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;they meet and discuss them at conferences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Star Trek conventions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and they try to find new experiments they can do that will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;probe deeper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They try to do experiments that will give a more positive psi result,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the do NOT try to do better experiments. That is not science. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is Cargo Cult science. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You can find these results in such journals as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;International Journal of Parapsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Psychological Bulletin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;European Journal of Parapsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Journal of Parapsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well those are splendid sounding names, they have neat sounding words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like “international” and “European” and “Journal” in them, I realty like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way they roll off the tongue, they sound very intelligent, highbrow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brainy, upper class, high IQ, downright spiffy; but why didn’t all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amazingly brilliant new Einsteins publish their remarkable discoveries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Nature or Science? Why do almost none of the authors of the articles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in those “Journals” also write in mainstream respectable Science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publications?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In truth the “journals” you mentioned above are indeed excellent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent for lining the bottom of your bird cage with. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;At the end of the day, though, it is frustrating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to work in a  theoretical vacuum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why? When Roentgen discovered X rays nobody had the slightest idea what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were, that's why he called them X rays. Nobody could explain them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they didn't fit in with any current theory, not one. Nevertheless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists instantly accepted that they existed because although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roentgen's claim was absolutely extraordinary so was his evidence; he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had a photograph of the bones in his wife’s hand, you could see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bones. Let me repeat that, you could see the BONES! And the woman was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still alive! That is just about as good as is possible for evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although he had no theory for this bizarre phenomena, not even a hint,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his results were instantly accepted. Far from being an outcast Roentgen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became an instant hero. He was the most respected scientist of his age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and he received the very first (well deserved) Nobel Prize in Physics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The exact same positive response would happen if somebody could show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the paranormal existed, even if he couldn't explain one tinny tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit of it.
</em><br>
<p>Who was the guy who came up with the theory of continental drift?  Was 
<br>
it Wegener?  Is your study of the history of science as patchy and 
<br>
selective as your grasp of current research?  Or would you care to put, 
<br>
alongside your account of Roentgen, an account of what happened to 
<br>
Wegener as well?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I’ve got to tell you, I’m not holding my breath.
</em><br>
<p>Well, thank goodness.  Your eyes are firmly closed, so I would be 
<br>
concerned for your health if your mouth and nose were closed as well.
