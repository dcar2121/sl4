<p>
Interesting story on the Singularity. In 2104, an historian explain what
<br>
&quot;Singularity&quot; meant and why it did not happen in the previous century. The
<br>
main argument is that the complexity of the *interesting* problems to be
<br>
solved increase exponentially with the capacity to solve them, thus the rate
<br>
of progress stay linear. For example, even with computers with more
<br>
processing capacity than the human brain, they don't have yet anything
<br>
resembling a human intelligence embodied in a machine. The Searle argument
<br>
is quoted.
<br>
I am not sure if I buy this argument, but I also suspect that the &quot;gentle
<br>
hill of progress&quot; will continue as such, at least from the point of view of
<br>
those who are climbing it.
<br>
Ambient Irony &lt;<a href="http://ai.mu.nu/archives/2104/01/forever_in_a_dr.php">http://ai.mu.nu/archives/2104/01/forever_in_a_dr.php</a>&gt;: &quot;And
<br>
that's what killed the Spike. The Technological Singularity relied on the
<br>
assumption that we would have ever-increasing computational resources to
<br>
address the problem of, well, increasing our computational resources, but
<br>
that the problems we would have to solve would not increase at the same
<br>
rate. When it turned out that the complexity of the problems increased as
<br>
fast as - or even faster than - our ability to solve them, the inevitable
<br>
Spike turned into the gentle hill of progress. And instead of the transhuman
<br>
era, we ended up with a very human era indeed&quot;.
