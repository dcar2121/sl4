<em>&gt; &gt; I think an identification of topics that don't require a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; expertise to comprehend and have a lot of room for people to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; differing opinions, room to have subjective, noisy, (and largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pointless) debate about, would help to provide the raw fodder for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those (like me) that wish to start a public, amateur-friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussion. While rehashing basic points of this or that subtopic over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and over again with slight variations may be distasteful and pointless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to those with real expertise in the subject, this is what real web
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussion looks like. It's what we're going to have to foster if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to gain any sort of visibility through the method.

<em>&gt; Visibility is all good, but resources are limited.
</em><br>
<p>The availability of resources is much less relevant than group
<br>
dynamics which, in this case, place strong bounds on the kind of
<br>
resources that do end up producing publicly visible discussion, and
<br>
not just a lot of silence. The &quot;valuable and limited&quot; resources you
<br>
probably have in mind are people who often wouldn't really be
<br>
interested in popularizing, and fighting the consequent popular
<br>
mischaracterization, of transhumanist ideas. Other people with more
<br>
time, less expertise, and a willingness to do this sort of thing can
<br>
more than make up for that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Visibility is already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that quite a lot of technical people are converging on this idea, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postulate that's enough.
</em><br>
<p>So, you disagree with the basic premise of the post I was responding
<br>
to, that transhumanist causes are rather improverished as far as the
<br>
public visibility of the debate over those issues? You think that our
<br>
current visibility is enough? Well, then, it doesn't really matter
<br>
what we do one way or another to increase it. But I think you'll find
<br>
many people here that disagree with you.
<br>
<p>To limit one's audience to those with a lot of intelligence and who
<br>
are conversant in the technical language used by transhumanist
<br>
advocates is to effectively seal debate about transhumanism from the
<br>
public sphere. I think Brandon Reinhart realizes this, and it bothers
<br>
him.
