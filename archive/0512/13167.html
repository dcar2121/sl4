Re: what morality is all about (at bottom) . . . Just a suggestion - instead of muddling around with Kant's 'Categoricals' (over 200-year old nonsense), or talking about 'good' and 'morality' as if Nietzsche had never been born (100-year old seminal reconceptualization)...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You should perhaps start at the state of the art: what little is known so far about human behavioral psychology, evolutionary psychology, human ethology, evolution of behaviors (cf. Hull's universal theory for replicators - this ain't your grandpa's 'meme' theory), cultural evolution, history of human cultures, neuroscience related to motivation and behavior, etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans don't agree on what is right or wrong today, and much of what they do is different from what they say. Yet there seems to be a       ing delusion here that there must be an objective, absolute, bird's-eye/God's-eye-point-of-view 'morality' from which such questions could be decided, and then operationalized in an AI to the benefit of all humanity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very strange... and frankly, old-fashioned, for what is supposed to be cutting-edge discussion.
