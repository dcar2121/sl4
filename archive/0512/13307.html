On Thu, 29 Dec 2005 &quot;Richard Loosemore&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20Free%20Will%20debate%20[WAS%20Free%20Will%20not%20an%20illusion.%20AND%20impotent%20%20%20disorganized%20gods?">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; what I was alluding to is the posibility that effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen in the world that are not random
</em><br>
<p>Then they have a cause, not almost a cause, or sort of a cause, or half
<br>
a cause, but a cause.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but which are coupled to their causes (in  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this case human wishes or intentions)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a way that is barely governed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by any regular laws.
</em><br>
<p>Gobbledygook. To say something has a cause is logical, to say something
<br>
does not have a cause is logical, to say neither is true is idiotic.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; may lead us to call this something different than cause 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and effect. 
</em><br>
<p>The word is random. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; it [psi] looks diabolically irregular and capricious.
</em><br>
<p>Suppose just for a moment that we lived in a world where psi did not
<br>
exist but that almost every human being on the planet, including
<br>
scientists (and me) wished it did, what do you suppose the results of
<br>
psi experiments performed by third rate scientists would look like? They
<br>
would look diabolically irregular and capricious.
<br>
<p>PS: we live in that world. 
<br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I personally have very strong evidence that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; something_ going on out there that is not encompassed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; by normal science.
</em><br>
<p>Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Then you should be writing your Nobel Prize acceptance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; speech not gabbing on the internet.
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt; Please try to spare the sarcasm.
</em><br>
<p>No. If what you said was true, if you really do have “very strong
<br>
evidence” for the existence of psi then you have made a HUGE discovery
<br>
and the Nobel Prize is just one of the countless honors you richly
<br>
deserve. In fact you are the greatest scientist since Newton. And that
<br>
my friend is no sarcasm, provided of course that what you said was true. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we tend to be treated with something less than respect.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From this day forward I solemnly vow to give parapsychology researchers
</em><br>
all the respect they deserve. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; many of us start to feel like doing something else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not bothering until the world becomes a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more mature about it.
</em><br>
<p>And I feel it is stupid to listen to psi “scientists” until they can
<br>
produce one experiment, one, just one, that is repeatable. Until then
<br>
they are witch doctors. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you have laid out a version of reality that you would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *prefer* to be  true, rather than the one that actually is true.
</em><br>
<p>What in hell are you talking about? I would LOVE it if it were true! I
<br>
would LOVE it if every one of the claims made by the psi loonies turned
<br>
out to be true! Who wouldn’t? I would LOVE to live in Harry Potter’s
<br>
world! I would LOVE to take a remedial adult education class in potion
<br>
making at Hogwarts!
<br>
<p>Unfortunately wishing does not make it so. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Some parapsychologists have done carefully controlled, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatable experiments that demonstrate the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of  certain effects that appear to be inexplicable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by current laws. 
</em><br>
<p>BULLSHIT! COSMIC ASTRONOMICAL BULLSHIT!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They publish these results in journals
</em><br>
<p>National Enquirer? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; they meet and discuss them at conferences
</em><br>
<p>Star Trek conventions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and they try to find new experiments they can do that will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probe deeper.
</em><br>
<p>They try to do experiments that will give a more positive psi result,
<br>
but the do NOT try to do better experiments. That is not science. That
<br>
is Cargo Cult science. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can find these results in such journals as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; International Journal of Parapsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Psychological Bulletin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; European Journal of Parapsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Journal of Parapsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Journal of the Society for Psychical Research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research
</em><br>
<p>Well those are splendid sounding names, they have neat sounding words
<br>
like “international” and “European” and “Journal” in them, I realty like
<br>
the way they roll off the tongue, they sound very intelligent, highbrow,
<br>
brainy, upper class, high IQ, downright spiffy; but why didn’t all those
<br>
amazingly brilliant new Einsteins publish their remarkable discoveries
<br>
in Nature or Science? Why do almost none of the authors of the articles
<br>
in those “Journals” also write in mainstream respectable Science
<br>
publications?
<br>
<p>In truth the “journals” you mentioned above are indeed excellent,
<br>
excellent for lining the bottom of your bird cage with. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At the end of the day, though, it is frustrating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to work in a  theoretical vacuum.
</em><br>
<p>Why? When Roentgen discovered X rays nobody had the slightest idea what
<br>
they were, that's why he called them X rays. Nobody could explain them
<br>
and they didn't fit in with any current theory, not one. Nevertheless
<br>
scientists instantly accepted that they existed because although
<br>
Roentgen's claim was absolutely extraordinary so was his evidence; he
<br>
had a photograph of the bones in his wife’s hand, you could see the
<br>
bones. Let me repeat that, you could see the BONES! And the woman was
<br>
still alive! That is just about as good as is possible for evidence to
<br>
get. 
<br>
<p>Although he had no theory for this bizarre phenomena, not even a hint,
<br>
his results were instantly accepted. Far from being an outcast Roentgen
<br>
became an instant hero. He was the most respected scientist of his age
<br>
and he received the very first (well deserved) Nobel Prize in Physics.
<br>
The exact same positive response would happen if somebody could show
<br>
that the paranormal existed, even if he couldn't explain one tinny tiny
<br>
bit of it.
<br>
<p>I’ve got to tell you, I’m not holding my breath.
<br>
