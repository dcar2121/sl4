<p>
I've just spent some time participating in this contest
<br>
<a href="http://www.sinceslicedbread.com">http://www.sinceslicedbread.com</a>
<br>
<p>Having submitted 160 entries out of 22,000 for this contest with $200,000 of 
<br>
prize money at stake, given the quality of the average entry, I think it's 
<br>
fair to say that I will probably get at least 1 into the final cut of 21 
<br>
items (unless my thinking style is totally alien to the judges).  From then 
<br>
down to 3 is a matter of politics (unless it turns out to be a matter of 
<br>
cheating, but I hope the former).  Since you know that I know know what 
<br>
money is for, I'm hoping that everyone here can sign up at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.sinceslicedbread.com">http://www.sinceslicedbread.com</a> and ultimately vote for one of mine (I will 
<br>
say which are mine when the vote begins).  Please sign up ASAP.

<br>
<p>BTW, it was actually an interesting experience.  A few weeks worth of 
<br>
thought about how society does spend its money and fund things lead me to 
<br>
the recognition of how overwhelmingly SL0 even &quot;scientific&quot; spending is, and 
<br>
how many rather simple, established, and obvious SL0 market opportunities 
<br>
(things like bridges in locations with well established demand) go 
<br>
unexploited.  It definitely moved me towards a view of the economy as more 
<br>
&quot;evolution-like&quot; and less &quot;rational maximizer with foresight-like&quot; than I 
<br>
had been accustomed to assume.  I don't know if this is relevant to 
<br>
fund-raising, but it might be.
<br>
<p>One guess as to why $20 bills are left lying on the ground is that our 
<br>
society lacks significant consumer goods in the $50,000,000 - $5,000,000,000 
<br>
price range.  As a result, people with wealth in that range don't really 
<br>
have any rational reason to try to maximize wealth and so relatively 
<br>
rational people in that wealth range (not common to begin with) don't bother 
<br>
to try to do so (by exploiting investment opportunities).  If so, it might 
<br>
be that SingInst should attempt to market itself as a high end consumer 
<br>
product, like commercial space travel outfits are beginning to.  Is it 
<br>
plausible that AI Box games could be marketed to a higher income audience 
<br>
for stakes large enough to matter?  Could Tyler be taught to play the AI?
