Nick Bostrom said
<br>
&quot;There are different options for who should decide what questions could be
<br>
posed to the Oracle. It might be difficult to ensure that the best such
<br>
option is instantiated. But this problem is not unique to the
<br>
Oracle-approach. It is also difficult to ensure that the first AGI is built
<br>
by the best people to do it. The question here is, for whichever group has
<br>
control over the first AGI - whether it's SIAI, the Pentagon, the UN, or
<br>
whatever - what is the best way to build the AGI? &quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, we don't need to worry about what the best way to build an AI is 
<br>
for the pentagon, UN, or whatever, since they will absolutely not listen to 
<br>
us.  How many of the world's most respected minds, far more respected than 
<br>
anyone here can realistically hope to become, protested nuclear build-up?  
<br>
To what effect?  When large institutions can't deal intelligently with SL0 
<br>
problems, such as global poverty and fossil fuel related problems, expecting 
<br>
them to handle SL4 genies is hopeless.  It has only been what, 230 years, 
<br>
since Adam Smith compellingly laid out the case against most tariffs?  
<br>
Remember Normal Angell?  
<br>

<br>
No, there is far more chance that we are all simply wrong about the 
<br>
possibility of GAI and transhuman technology in general than there is that 
<br>
issues that we are dealing with, which are not currently understood even 
<br>
crudely by somewhere between, 98% and 99.8% of researchers engaged in 
<br>
academic AI will be managed intelligently by international institutions 
<br>
within a century.
<br>
Seriously, can anyone come up with even a hopeful historical analogy here?
<br>
<p>Also
<br>
&quot;Find the most accurate answer to
<br>
the question you can within 5 seconds by shuffling electrons in these
<br>
circuits and accessing these sources of information, and output the answer
<br>
in the form of 10 pages print-out. &quot;
<br>
<p>Two difficulties with this include the difficulty of bringing an AI to 
<br>
useful oracle status without utilizing rapid take-off or bootstrapping 
<br>
procedures and the difficulty of defining allowable methods.  I could easily 
<br>
believe, for instance, that the most accurate answer available within 5 
<br>
seconds might be reached by moving electrons in such a manner that a 
<br>
superintelligent optimization process appears somewhere else and creates 
<br>
havoc while arranging for the oracle to give the correct answer unless the 
<br>
oracle's utility function was defined impossibly carefully.  This seems like 
<br>
adversarial technique to me.  You are trying to predict how the AI might 
<br>
accomplish a goal and rule out all of the specific possibilities including 
<br>
ones you haven't thought of.
<br>
Defining the utility function associated with the output is also difficult.  
<br>
Without an understanding of the programmer's minds, the best output might be 
<br>
a compressed version of the input and the utilized data.  To do much better, 
<br>
the AI will probably need roughly human-level mental modeling, which implies 
<br>
non-trivial volition extraction anyway.
<br>
For what it's intended to do, this approach seems less safe and less 
<br>
powerful than devising a non general AI in the form of a super-CAD for use 
<br>
in uploading,
