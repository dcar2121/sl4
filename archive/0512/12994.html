<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;By the way, I believe that we will create friendly AI, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we will also (eventually) create unfriendly AI, either by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accident or by design.  &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm just curious where you came up with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; By my understanding, these two are mutually exclusive... in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the sense that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if you actually create an FAI, it will quickly ensure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nobody create a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; UFAI (major existential risk), and if you create a UFAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; first, then that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tends to imply humans are, well, screwed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, even assuming you are correct and that the first friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI of sufficient interlligence eliminates the possibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an unfriendly AI (very doubtful but as least useful as a thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiment) then notice that SOMEONE would have created that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;friendly AI, and someone else somewhere will be bound to disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do you expect everyone would agree that the US Military (or NSA,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or whatever) has the final say on &quot;friendly&quot;, or that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;commercial organiation (e.g., IBM, Microsoft) has the final
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say?  Just look at the people who HATE Microsoft merely for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selling a lot of software that they don't wish to use.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or imagine a terrorist or terrorist supporting nation has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;first&quot; friendly (in their terms) AI....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or, it's open source?  How do you stop some human from taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it offline and tinkering with it until it is able to do battle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again with the Supreme Friendly AI running the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People cannot even agree on what would constitute 'friendly'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or 'unfriendly' behavior -- if it is powerful enough to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any competitors it will by definition have to PROTECT itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and, almost by definition, have to evolve to counter new threats,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at which point you cannot count on ANY pre-programmed friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior being permanent.
</em><br>
<p>Stop here.
<br>
<p>You are making a very critical and very subtle implicit assumption here. The 
<br>
AI's exponential increase in intelligence is absolutely nothing like 
<br>
evolution. I don't know how to make this any more clear: If your 
<br>
intelligence is running on a computer substrate, you inherently have the 
<br>
ability to create cognitive tools which would enable the AI to far exceed 
<br>
any human capacity. This super-powerful think tank could literally start 
<br>
internet businesses or software development businesses by the hundreds and 
<br>
gain real cash extremely fast. From there the think-tank switches itself to 
<br>
nanotechnological development and essentially does what is necessary to 
<br>
literally optimize whatever goal it has until the ends of the entire 
<br>
Universe have been touched by it's Power.
<br>
<p>Welcome to the Singularity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An evolving, all-powerful, friendly AI is a new species over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which we cannot guarantee control over any sufficiently long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;period of time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even if we could guarantee this, we couldn't agree on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definition of friendly or the evaluation of it's behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yesterday when it stopped some war between two countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Someone didn't get their way; perhaps someone had to die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Someone does not think this is friendly. If you are lucky,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you are not on &quot;that side.&quot;
</em><br>
