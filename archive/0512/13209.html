Richard Loosemore said
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So when you say &quot;Friendly AIs [...] act according to decision theory.&quot; you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean &quot;The particular interpretation of how to build a Friendly AI that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;common on this list, acts according to decision theory.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, since Friendly was capitalized in my post, Friendly did in fact mean, 
<br>
explicitly, the sort of AI described here 
<br>
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/index.html">http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/index.html</a> and elsewhere.
<br>
I'm perfectly aware that Aibo is friendly, and imagine that the upload of 
<br>
any congenial person would be as well, but don't expect Aibos or uploads to 
<br>
recursively self-improve safely.
<br>
<p>On a more congenial note, I like what Richard, Chris Capel, and Jeff have 
<br>
been suggesting for improving discussion quality.  You might all want to 
<br>
look into Chris Phoenix's appearently stalled &quot;Wise Nano&quot; project and 
<br>
discuss with him the question of &quot;what worked&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't agree that reading the complete archives before contributing is an 
<br>
unreasonable standard.  I did just that, and the site explicitly asks people 
<br>
to, or at least used to do so.  However, it's an unattained standard.  If 
<br>
people were just asked to read the SL4 wiki there might be more compliance.
<br>
<p><p>Unlike David Picon Alvarez, I would not dare to say anything about what the 
<br>
majority of posters on this list think about qualia.
