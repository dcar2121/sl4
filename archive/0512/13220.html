<p>
huh!!?!
<br>
<p><p>I don't think that free will exists.  Sure philosophers have tried to save
<br>
it by redfining it but what most people consider to be free will is
<br>
inconsistent with causality (and no quantum randomness is no escape hatch).
<br>
I wrote an essay about free will a little while ago.  Here is an excerpt:
<br>
<p>I cannot define free will.  I don't know how it would work.  However I
<br>
can say with some degree of certainty that most people do not consider
<br>
behavior that is entirely the product of non-chosen factors to be
<br>
free.  Furthermore, I can prove that this is the only kind of behavior
<br>
humans are capable of if the world is as it seems.  Here is a proof by
<br>
induction:
<br>
<p>Assume that a person (P) is born with certain endowments, genetics and
<br>
physical factors in general (G), and maybe a spirit or some other
<br>
ethereal energy (S).  So at time 0, before the person has had any
<br>
experience with the world or had the opportunity to make any choices,
<br>
the total contents of the person will be P = G + S.  None of these
<br>
factors are the product of free will.  G is the product of the parents
<br>
union, and S (if it is nonzero) is chosen by god or some other
<br>
ethereal force.  At time 1, the person makes its first contact with
<br>
the world (W), another non-chosen factor, and has experience E(1).
<br>
E(1) is necessarily the result of W, G, S, or some combination of the
<br>
three.  Regardless of the permutation, the experience is not the
<br>
result of free will unless free will is defined as the product of
<br>
non-chosen factors.  As a result of experience E(1), P = G + S + E(1).
<br>
&nbsp;P's next experience (E(2)) will be the result of some permutation of
<br>
W, G, S, and E(1). So E(2) will be the product of non-chosen factors
<br>
W, G, S and E(1), which itself was the product of these factors.  As a
<br>
result of E(2), P = G + S + E(1) + E(2).  So in the next period, P's
<br>
interaction with the world will be the product of non-willed factors
<br>
W, G, S, E(1) (which is a product of W G and S) and E(2) (which is a
<br>
product of W G and S and E(1)).  So this interaction is also the
<br>
product of entirely non-chosen factors.  Assume that the same is true
<br>
after k periods, such that E(k) is the product of W, G, S and E(1),
<br>
E(2), …, E(k – 1).  All of these experiences are ultimately the
<br>
product of W, G, and S.  So E(k) is also the product of these factors.
<br>
&nbsp;Then E(k + 1) will be a product of  W, G, S and E(1), E(2), …, E(k -
<br>
1) and E(k).  As assumed, E(1), E(2), …, E(k - 1) are the product of
<br>
W, G, S and E(k) is also the product of W G and S.  So E(k+1) is as
<br>
well.  Therefore, by induction, the interaction between P and W in any
<br>
period will be entirely the product of non-chosen factors.  After many
<br>
periods, choices may seem free because one cannot figure out precisely
<br>
how these factors are interacting, just as numbers produced by a
<br>
sufficiently complex algorithm may seem random to one witnessing the
<br>
output.
<br>
<p>Of course, this proof only holds if the world is accurately described
<br>
by mathematics.  It is also possible that my assumptions are mistaken
<br>
and there is some mysterious process (MP) that allows humans to have
<br>
free will.
