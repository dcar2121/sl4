<em>&gt;Subject: Why the Spike did not happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Sun, 4 Dec 2005 07:28:05 +0100
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Interesting story on the Singularity. In 2104, an historian explain what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Singularity&quot; meant and why it did not happen in the previous century. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;main argument is that the complexity of the *interesting* problems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solved increase exponentially with the capacity to solve them, thus the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of progress stay linear. For example, even with computers with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processing capacity than the human brain, they don't have yet anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resembling a human intelligence embodied in a machine. The Searle argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is quoted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am not sure if I buy this argument, but I also suspect that the &quot;gentle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hill of progress&quot; will continue as such, at least from the point of view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those who are climbing it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ambient Irony &lt;<a href="http://ai.mu.nu/archives/2104/01/forever_in_a_dr.php">http://ai.mu.nu/archives/2104/01/forever_in_a_dr.php</a>&gt;: &quot;And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that's what killed the Spike. The Technological Singularity relied on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assumption that we would have ever-increasing computational resources to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;address the problem of, well, increasing our computational resources, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that the problems we would have to solve would not increase at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rate. When it turned out that the complexity of the problems increased as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast as - or even faster than - our ability to solve them, the inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Spike turned into the gentle hill of progress. And instead of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;era, we ended up with a very human era indeed&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Fuck that!
<br>
<p><p>...But from a more even-handed standpoint, I somehow find this a very 
<br>
improbable scenario.
<br>
<p>I mean come on.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2005/tc2005066_6414_tc024.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2005/tc2005066_6414_tc024.htm</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;BlueGene/P will have faster processors and could ultimately reach petaflops 
<br>
speeds-- quadrillions of calculations per second. &quot;We're planning on a very 
<br>
long-term effort,&quot; notes Markram. &quot;We're creating a unique facility for 
<br>
researchers worldwide.&quot; Adds Charles Peck, the IBM researcher who leads the 
<br>
Blue Brain effort at IBM's research division in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.: 
<br>
&quot;There's now a tremendous opportunity to do some science that up to this 
<br>
point just hasn't been possible.&quot;
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&quot;Since the neocortical column was first discovered 40 years ago, researchers 
<br>
have been painstakingly unraveling how it helps perform the miracles of 
<br>
thought that enable humans to be creative, inventive, philosophical 
<br>
creatures. &quot;That's been my passion, my mission for 10 years,&quot; says Markram. 
<br>
&quot;Now, we know how information is transferred form one neuron to another. We 
<br>
know how they behave -- what they do and whom they talk to. We've actually 
<br>
mapped that out.&quot;
<br>
<p>Next, that knowledge will be transferred into a torridly fast silicon 
<br>
simulator. Blue Brain promises a fantastic acceleration in brain research. 
<br>
It could be as dramatic as the leap from chiseling numbers in Sumerian clay 
<br>
tablets 2,500 years ago to crunching them in modern computers. And the Blue 
<br>
Brain Project just might culminate in a new breed of supersmart computers 
<br>
that will make even BlueGene/L seem like a piker. &quot;
