&nbsp;&nbsp;I am increasingly frustrated by the observation and experience that on
<br>
the various transhumanist lists, a graph of posting frequency by
<br>
individual would show a hump, with those who have enthusiastic but
<br>
relatively incomplete thinking posting far more than those who have
<br>
more coherent views or those who may not have strong views at all.
<br>
<p>This is to be expected, but it tends to promote regression to the mean
<br>
more than leading-edge growth.
<br>
<p>Creative growth requires diverse input, but mining these transhumanist
<br>
lists for nuggets of leading edge ideas, or planting seeds of thought
<br>
when a fertile opportunity seems to be presented, provides such sparse
<br>
payback that I and many others question whether we've long since past
<br>
the point of diminishing returns.
<br>
<p>I think we've reached the point that we need new tools--an improved
<br>
framework--for collaborative thinking including concept mapping,
<br>
argument mapping, and shared knowledge that goes qualitatively beyond
<br>
the wiki and the email list. I don't have the available bandwidth to
<br>
create this or even to organize such a project, and I see it coming
<br>
just around the corner with all the growing awareness of &quot;web 2.0&quot; and
<br>
social software, but I would be very interested in contributing some
<br>
time and resources to such a project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds like a good idea. It would not only help you all work out your theories/proposals, but it would also help explain them to people like me trying to figure out what you all are theorizing/proposing.
