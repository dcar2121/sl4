I would question the assumption that a sufficiently intelligent AGI would
<br>
not have a 'self'. Any intelligence which is conscious and aware of that
<br>
consciousness certainly would have a self. I argue that sufficiently
<br>
powerful AGI must have self consciousness because such an intelligence, in
<br>
order to be sufficiently intelligent, must be able to add its own agency as
<br>
one aspect of the system that it is modeling (reality). Now if this is true,
<br>
i.e. that real AGI must be self-aware, then it would be highly dangerous to
<br>
have a bunch of super intelligent AGI running around treating people as a
<br>
means to an end alone. Note that it is ok to treat a person as means to an
<br>
end as long as that action can be justified as also being an end in itself.
<br>
Also I contend that if an AGI is self-aware that it must be programmed to
<br>
understand that it is not just an individual but part of a collective which
<br>
is human civilization and part of its goal system should be in service to
<br>
this collective. This is not just true for machines but for people as well.

<em>&gt; Yes Jef.  I think we agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that there are several problems here relating to being understood

<em>&gt; though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first, real humans are not agents.  Rather, they act *slightly*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent-like at least a little of the time.  Agency is immensely powerful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization is the result.  However, a consequence of this is that almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all people have no model of agency, and fail to understand it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.  (are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Role Playing Games effectively training in understanding agency?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second problem is that among those few who understand agency we often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a &quot;virtue and sanity&quot; cargo cult.  It is correct that certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions, and preferences, such as the belief that the world is about to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end, that one is uniquely almost uniquely capable of saving it, or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one no longer needs traditional morality are extremely good empirically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validated predictors of harmful behavior.  It is likewise true that in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pacific Islands in the 1940s airstrips were good empirically validated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictors of food delivery.  The refusal to formally adopt agency in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of evolved morality despite the knowledge that morality is evolved for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically different environment because morality's rejection has predicted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive behavior in the past is thus similar to building airstrips
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the food deliveries have stopped, especially since agency, properly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood, encompasses fully that part of evolved moral behavior that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to it's self-referential nature and connection to your goal system) you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to retain.  Similar things can be said about the refusal to adopt any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular far-from-appearent-consensus belief, especially beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the low rationality, agency (ironically), or competence of accepted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-status authorities.  Admittedly, the warmth of evolved morality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreement with consensus, and high regard for the leaders/authorities of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's society are features of one's goal system, so I am counciling a sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-sacrifice, but more properly I am counciling that certain goals be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporarily deferred for the sake of the long term, for without doing so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those goals will fail to be realized in the more distant future.  Students
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of psychology should be at least as aware of the need to avoid hyperbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discounting as students of history should be of insanity, especially given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the actual expected cost of insanity is so low (for most forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insanity, only one relatively normal human life worth of utility plus a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra is at stake).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tennessee.  The vast majority of FAI and UFAI designs are, at equilibrium,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequentialist rational agents, but NOT objectivitst.  They are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequentialist because without consequentialism, goals can drift, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequentialism is a black hole from which goals cannot, under ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances, drift.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are NOT objectivists because except in rare cases they aren't even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected to have a &quot;Self&quot; to be self-interested in.  Perfectly in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the categorical imperitive, they will see everything as a means to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like all consequentialists do.
