<p>
I agree with this post insofar as marketing is a goal.
<br>
<p>However, I like mailing lists a lot more than forums, and the sl4 
<br>
archives are available for anyone who wants to read them.
<br>
<p>I doubt that I would follow the discussions if I could not have them 
<br>
arrive as emails, and reply from my mail client. The forums vs mailing 
<br>
lists argument is an old one, and I think it's a mistake to think that 
<br>
either is a Final Solution.
<br>
<p>If it is the goal of this list to achieve a greater marketing impact, 
<br>
then pursuing some kind of marketing strategy is a good idea. Myself, I 
<br>
think it's an interesting list to be a part of as it is. I'm just here 
<br>
for the ride, folks. I came to eat, not to cook. I enjoy making an 
<br>
occasional contribution, being exposed to new ideas, and as AI 
<br>
technology has an increasing impact on the world I am sure this is 
<br>
exactly the right group of people to be talking to about what that means.
<br>
<p>As far as sl4 is concerned, I don't see any single agenda which is being 
<br>
pushed, other than awareness of the complexity of issues.
<br>
<p>I agree with the beneficial nature of having a blog for passers-by to 
<br>
interact with, but disagree with the importance (and value) of moving 
<br>
from mailing lists to a forums. Possibly some kind of rationalisation of 
<br>
the available mailing lists would be reasonable, but I see no great need 
<br>
to force it. Perhaps someone could set up an aggregation list, which 
<br>
sends and recieves to/from a set of lists, then people who were 
<br>
interested in interacting with the full gamut of viewpoints could do so, 
<br>
but that may cause more problems than it solves.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
