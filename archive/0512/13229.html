If you define free-will in terms of causality then, of course, there is no
<br>
free-will. However, I think that there is something that is meant by
<br>
free-will and it really has nothing to do with causality. The issue, I
<br>
think, is in what faculty of the mind governs a person's actions - instinct
<br>
or reason. We all know people who's lives are governed by instinct almost
<br>
exclusively. these people act more like animals than people. The truly free
<br>
individual is the rational individual. It is a state of consciousness that
<br>
can be achieved. The ability to achieve this state of rationality may be
<br>
determined by a combination of genetics and environment, but nevertheless,
<br>
that person is 'self-determinate'. This idea is the crux of almost all of
<br>
German philosophy - everything from Kant's categorical Imperative to
<br>
Nietzsche's Will to Power. Man is a being who has the power to direct his
<br>
own actions based on reason (modelling the universe and acting toward a
<br>
super-goal). This same idea can be found also in the theology of St. Paul.
<br>
Paul who constantly makes references to the bondage of the flesh (instinct)
<br>
and admonishes his followers to &quot;take the mind of Christ&quot; (rationality) in
<br>
order to gain freedom over the bondage.
