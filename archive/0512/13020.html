<em>&gt; &gt; Do you have any particular references (preferably online)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for &quot;text summarization&quot; -- that is, the ability to extract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; summaries or to paraphrase text and information?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not exactly text summarization, but I'd advice you to check 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Pascal's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (nothing to do with the language) automated recognition of textual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entailment challenge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/Introduction/">http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/Introduction/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea is to generate an automatic process by which a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognized to be logically entailed from another. For 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example: Jane works as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an electrician in the weekends entails Jane is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrician, Jane is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, etc. (Note that entailment itself generally has some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues, Jane could be a robot, but we'd hardly consider this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the moment.)
</em><br>
<p>Thank you.
<br>
<p>I also found that the &quot;Publications&quot; link (on practically
<br>
every page at the Pascal site) was full of interesting articles,
<br>
probably more than I can read quickly.
<br>
<p>Just knowing the word &quot;entailment&quot;, and how it is used
<br>
technically, is a boon to searching.

&gt; I was doing some undergraduate-level work on this stuff, and 
&gt; the existing
&gt; approaches are very shallow, semantically speaking. The 
&gt; common thing to do
&gt; is using very very low-level metrics like Lvenshtein distance 
&gt; and such in
&gt; order to find markers of entailment, and the only group I know of (at
&gt; Edimburgh University) which went about it the Right Way (tm), 
&gt; building a
&gt; parser and trying to do some serious semantic work, gets a much worse
&gt; f-measure than the statistics-driven groups. Of course they 
&gt; get very very
&gt; good accuracy, but very bad recall, since their semantic 
&gt; analysis isn't
&gt; complete and many true entailments pass them by, but when 
&gt; they see one it is
&gt; almost sure there is one.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; (This is a field that interests me greatly.  Along with
&gt; &gt; the idea of programs that write and optimize programs
&gt; &gt; seems to be where much of the leverage can be found; and
&gt; &gt; where my own VERY modest efforts are directed.)
