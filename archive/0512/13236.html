Sorry, my post was crap.  I never presented any argument beyond circular reasoning for *why* we shouldn't just slice and dice Nemo.  A RPOP would need less energy to merely feed an already existing human, cure a brain tumour, immortalize somatic cells, etc, than ve would to assemble a new better person from scratch.  Efficiency would dictate we would not be steamrolled.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was making a garbled attempt to expose two very different ethics, the correct one to apply depends on whether or not we have a shot at an infinite energy source.  And I was also confusing the process of human utilitarianism with the functions of a RPOP.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the world better, humans need diversity.  RPOP doesn't need anything but a goal structure and matter/energy.  Two strictly identical persons are inferior to two separate skill sets.  So I was against the idea of AGI tiling because it seems to indicate a maximum universal quality-of-living plateau will be found and then maintained until the end of time.  This would indicate the sum total of all man years in the present and future is finite.  But if there really might be a (dangerous) energy source out there that is abundant or efficient, the correct course of ethics is to bask in our inferior energy source for as long as possible, and then take a shot at &quot;fountain-of-youth&quot;.  However we might miss out entirely on this shot if the AGI is programmed only to tile and to ignore this possibility.  If an AGI is programmed to maximize a finite value, it won't process the infinity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider an island slowly falling into the ocean.  For the inhabitants, the ethics really should be subjective and selfish.  Now consider the same island rising from the ocean.  Human rights emerge as a possibility.  If we pollute our immediate surroundings with AGI-tiled (better) energy rivals, we have turned what appeared to be a positive sum ethical environment into a zero-sum free for all game of machivellian survival.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All great things bring about there own destruction through an act of self overcoming&quot;.  They don't get saved by AGI.  Beyond providing physical sustinence essentials, I don't see how else an AGI can really help us.

<p>I propose that this post, sincere in its intent, dense in its
<br>
references to philosophical concepts, and intractable in its
<br>
semantics, be used to test the capabilities of our future platform for
<br>
untangling, disambiguating and elucidating such discussion.
