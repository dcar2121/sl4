</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; astro experts?
</em><br>
<p>Having recently taught astronomy, I'll step in and hope I've remembered 
<br>
them all correctly:
<br>
<p>Meteor:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thing that flashes across the sky (meteor=light-show).
<br>
Meteoroid:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the  actual lump of rock or dust that causes the meteor.
<br>
Meteorite:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the part of the meteoroid (if any) that reaches the ground.
<br>
Bolide:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a particular type of big, slow-moving, often noisy and spectacular 
<br>
meteor.
<br>
<p>****************
<br>
<p>More generally, on the subject of risks that might threaten the 
<br>
singularity, I found all the recent discussion quaint and spectacularly 
<br>
irrelevant:  when the H5N5 virus (or similar) finally decides to mutate 
<br>
into a pandemic, the probable consequences (near complete destruction of 
<br>
the world's economic system, panic, mob rule, starvation and of course, 
<br>
for those who contract the actual virus, death) could easily reduce the 
<br>
high-tech western world, with its just-in-time production system and 
<br>
sensitivity to television-inspired overreaction, to about the same level 
<br>
as the peak of European civilisation circa 800 A.D.
<br>
<p>Can you say &quot;kiss goodbye to the singularity&quot;?
<br>
<p>I am amazed that no one is doing anything about this.  We, of all people 
<br>
who can see the future more clearly than most.  I am reminded of the 
<br>
people in New York on September 12th:  &quot;we didn't plan for this because 
<br>
it was just too terrible to imagine.&quot;
<br>
<p>I had some ideas about what to do, and even floated them around to some 
<br>
people, but was strongly discouraged, so I stopped trying.  It would 
<br>
require a lot of people to take it very seriously, and it became clear 
<br>
that nobody could grasp the reality of it.  Too terrible to imagine, you 
<br>
see.
<br>
<p>Interesting, neh?
