<p>
An extrapolation of the Kardashev scale suggests civilizations of types IV 
<br>
through VII, with VI implying control over multiple universes and VII implying 
<br>
mastery of ontotechnology to the effect of being able to create new universes. 
<br>
Its possible that the hyperbolic increase in intelligence resulting from a 
<br>
singularity allows a civilization to jump from Type I to Type VI without ever 
<br>
leaving the stellar backyard.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;some major problems (e.g. mortality), would you be okay with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;transcending, leaving them behind to die?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My objection to this scenario is that it neglects the possibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altruistic intervention. If the civilization next to you is suffering
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now consider that upon reaching Type VII status, a civilization is capable 
<br>
of intelligently designing universes, one would think a degree of moral 
<br>
responsibility would accompany this. I suspect, however, that Type VII 
<br>
ontotech wouldn't create single universes in an intentive, rule-based model, 
<br>
in analogy to the way most commercial videogames are designed. Instead, entire 
<br>
multiverses would run as evolutionary ontotech programs, akin to the model of 
<br>
black hole baby universes promulgated by Andrei Linde; such a system would be 
<br>
in analogy to paidic games such as &quot;Sim City&quot;, where randomization algorithms 
<br>
can produce many initial conditions which result in the emergence of many 
<br>
&quot;rule-sets&quot; appropriate to the different contexts and player intentions. Put 
<br>
simply, a Type VII civilization may run its ontotech off of a chaotic basis 
<br>
capable of generating unlimited universes, instead of an intelligent design 
<br>
model capable, by definition, of generating only a finite number of universes. 
<br>
Such a model implies a distribution of probability from the simplest voids to 
<br>
interesting, life-supporting universes like ours, which may in turn produce 
<br>
singularities and resulting Type VII civilizations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If expansion costs you almost nothing, why wouldn't you lend a hand to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone else?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The implication of an infinite distribution of probability is that there 
<br>
will be civilizations which are doomed as well as civilizations which 
<br>
transcend. In order for a universe to include an intervening agent that could 
<br>
overstep normal causation, it would have to be intelligently designed, which 
<br>
would contradict the evolutionary ontotech model. Its possible that there are 
<br>
intelligently designed universes as well as evolved universes, but if there 
<br>
weren't evolved universes where existential risk was implied, then creation 
<br>
would have a cap of finitude on its diversity, and that would be a graver 
<br>
tradegy than any catastrophe confined to a single world.
