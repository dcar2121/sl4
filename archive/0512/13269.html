<em>&gt;===== Original Message From Phillip Huggan &lt;<a href="mailto:cdnprodigy@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20KARDASHEV%20SCALE">cdnprodigy@yahoo.com</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The multiverse can be described as a Type VII civilization then.  Creating 
</em><br>
potential hell-scenarios is evil, regardless of how interesting they are.  
<br>
This is also the main point against the simulation argument.  If you want to 
<br>
temporarily leave your memories behind for a few decades of living in an inert 
<br>
simulation (where all the inflicted evils aren't real, like a sort of 
<br>
holodeck) because you are bored, fine.  But if you want to create singularity 
<br>
takeoff from a laboratory in Munich in a 2030 world where Hitler did not allow 
<br>
the Dunkirk evacuation and where he never attempted Barbarossa...  you should 
<br>
have gotten coal for X-mas instead of that shiny new ontotech-multiverse toy.  
<br>
Evil does not need to exist for diversity to be.
<br>
<p>I think your use of the word &quot;evil&quot; is problematic, and that the process of 
<br>
genetic evolution could be judged as very evil, being dependant on predation 
<br>
and other horrors selecting against members of the environment. Most common 
<br>
ideas of good would make provisions for the weak and try to avert disaster at 
<br>
any cost, but this isn't the way nature has operated. Now, post-singularity 
<br>
things don't need to follow the same patterns as the past, but this doesn't 
<br>
mean that a transcendant civilization would nessecarily comply with the &quot;good&quot; 
<br>
in either a religious or humanistic, U.N. intervention sense of the word. 
<br>
Since there is so much in the natural world that could be judged as evil, its 
<br>
reasonable to deduce that there are either no transcendant civilizations or 
<br>
that transcendant civilizations aren't interested in miminalizing evil 
<br>
throughout the multiverse, out of respect for heterogeneaity, the default flow 
<br>
of causality, or some other reasoning we don't yet understand.
