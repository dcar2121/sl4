Richard,
<br>
<p>This is an interesting suggestion, and it basically sounds like a
<br>
special kind of subject-specific Wikipedia, doesn't it?
<br>
<p>I guess that what you describe could fairly easily be implemented
<br>
using Wiki technology.
<br>
<p>I don't think your suggestion fully addresses the concerns Jef was
<br>
raising, but I think it would be a valuable contribution.
<br>
<p>Basically, I think that email lists and websites are good, but that
<br>
there would also be value in a variety of other
<br>
communication/interaction media, and the one you describe could be a
<br>
useful part of the mix.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What about a web site organized around &quot;evolving essays&quot;, of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following sort:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Someone starts with an encyclopaedia-like, hierarchical topic list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is supposed to be the set of categories within which essays (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will end up being encyclopaedia entries) are stored.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) This framework is debated, but the debate takes the form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restatements of the topic list, which are then voted on in some way.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example, if I think that a branch of the topic list headed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic &quot;AGI Goal Systems&quot; should be split into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     AGI Goal Systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Decision-Theory-Based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Motivational-System-Based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... then it is up to me to suggest this, and to provide two headline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraphs (no more than one para for each subtopic) that describe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two subtopics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) If an aelaboration of the topic tree is sanctioned, it first comes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a &quot;provisional&quot; branch, and it is then up to someone to suggest an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essay that describes the topic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) People give feedback to the poster of the essay, and the feedback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes privately (no back and forth argument at this stage) to the poster.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This person is supposed to incorporate the suggestions into the essay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) When the essay writer has done editing the essay it is resubmitted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list, and all, including the original reply folks, are invited to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say whether this is coherent enough to stand.  (Coherent according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various criteria TBD).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6) If someone strongly disagrees with the coherence of the essay, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must say so at this point, but there should be a fairly high threshold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for rejection (you cannot simply disagree with it, you have to posit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoherence).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7) Dissenting opinions are also allowed.  If an individual or a group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes that a particular entry is incomplete or wrong or bad in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, it can write a coherent reply in the form of an essay, and send it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the same process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I have in mind through this process is the collaborative writing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extremely hierarchical book.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another note:  I think that we should make some allowance for background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, but I am not sure how to do this.  For example, if someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well studied in philosophy makes comments about an issue that is, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about hardware design, there ought to some way to give those comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less weight than if they come from a software or hardware engineer.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vice-versa of course.  This is a little difficult, as it might imply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people voluntarily submitting their claimed areas of expertise, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not go over too well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Respectfully,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
