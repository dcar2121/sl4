</em><br>
<p>Winning the top ten lottery jackpots in the US would net you a quarter
<br>
of a billion dollars, looking at alllotto.com
<br>
<p>Not a billionaire, perhaps, but well on the way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Mega Millions lottery requires you to identify five numbers out of 56
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and an additional one number out of 46. Quickly now, tell me your brilliant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocol for achieving this aim given a phenomenon that manifests itself as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an excess of (at best) one extra correct guess in a hundred. It takes you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100,000 guesses to attain one standard deviation, which is hardly enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instil confidence. True, you're only risking a dollar, so you might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prepared to stop after 100,000 guesses.
</em><br>
<p>I can't imagine that you weren't paying attention, this very subject
<br>
came up once on the Extropians list, and Spike Jones rather cleverly
<br>
devised an error-correcting code using guessors of a given accuracy,
<br>
to produce any information, however unlikely. I can't find the post at
<br>
the moment, but I recall it being well within the realm of
<br>
possibility.
<br>
<p>It is possible, using various approaches, to devise a code to error
<br>
correct for any amount of noise in a communications channel, given
<br>
some success rate of communication above randomness. The amount of
<br>
extra effort, redundancy in communication required, is ideally shown
<br>
by Shannon's Theorem, although current systems (with the exception of
<br>
the Turbo Codes used by satellites and 3G phones) are usually very far
<br>
short of that ideal.
<br>
<p>If the effect is real, and above chance, then you can construct error
<br>
correcting codes using it. And you can use an error correcting system
<br>
to output data of any level of implausiblity, given enough time(or
<br>
enough parallel guessers).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I used to think it would be very easy: all you need to do is translate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence of decimal numbers into binary form and encode a binarized image
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from it as the target: dark versus light for the first one/zero, male
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versus female for the second one/zero, inside versus outside for the third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one/zero... The problem here is that a single mistake throws the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing out. Okay, so we invoke redundancy. But now new hazards arise, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least the necessity to find not just one but two or even 56 or 132 ace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remote viewers.
</em><br>
<p>The real question is, if you have the remote viewer working on the
<br>
same problem, does he output the same answer? Because if he doesn't,
<br>
you can just iterate him over the same question, and pick the output
<br>
that rises out of the noise floor. You can reframe the question in as
<br>
many ways as you like to make it a fresh attempt, of course.
<br>
<p>If a mistake is forever, then indeed you need more than one Remote
<br>
Viewer, unless you can stack them( i.e. &quot;What is the binary value of
<br>
this digit?&quot; &quot;Now were you right about the binary value of that digit&quot;
<br>
&quot;Was your last statement about the value of the value of that digit
<br>
right or wrong?&quot;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've bored you all, I can tell. Killfile the gullible idiot. Such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredible horseshit. Don't look, don't look.
</em><br>
<p>Damien, this is very tiresome. Do you really believe that people's
<br>
opinions about this sort of thing are controlled by some kind of
<br>
aversive skeptical reflex? How many people have gone looking for psi?
<br>
It's an industry, a community, a huge dream for all peoples since the
<br>
beginning of time. You can't claim it's for lack of looking that no
<br>
one has confirmed it. All kinds of people are looking at it at any
<br>
given moment. No one has devised a replicateable experiment, however
<br>
simple, which has sufficiently challenged mainstream scientists to
<br>
respond.
<br>
<p>The question is whether this implies something about all scientists,
<br>
or about all psi effects in experiment. The rewards in ignoring
<br>
something in science do exist, but so do rewards for investigating
<br>
something unfashionable and getting something cool named after
<br>
yourself. The fact that I've not found anything, and no one I have
<br>
heard about has found anything, is evidence I just tend to go with.
<br>
Occasionally I do look at referenced psi experiments, and they are
<br>
all, modestly unlikely results, as yet unreplicated, in ambigious
<br>
domains. I remain interested enough to check it out, mostly out of
<br>
whimsy, but I do not expect great things.
