<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I would be delighted to reply to your post, below, in a thoughtful and 
<br>
scientific way, as I did to David Clark at the beginning of the 
<br>
discussion with him.
<br>
<p>But you are already being abusive and sarcastic.
<br>
<p>Given this abusive attitude, which indicates that you have no interest 
<br>
in discussing the topic as a scientist, I don't think there is any point 
<br>
in me wasting my time and energy.
<br>
<p>If, at any time, you feel like changing your attitude, to something 
<br>
approximating objective inquiry, let me know and I will immediately 
<br>
respond to your comments below with as much care as I can.
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.

<em>&gt;&gt; I agree, the most robust stuff is precognitive.  That was the design 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the one experiment of mine that came out with an extremely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; significant result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It used to drive me crazy, with my physics background.  I did all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; work to collect the &quot;guesses&quot; of my subjects, but what I knew was that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the targets that they were trying to guess at would not be determined 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; until after all the data was collected and the pieces of paper were in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; my sweaty palms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Then I generated the random seed from a previously specified set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; global weather statistics, used it to dive into the RAND Corporation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Book of One Million Random Digits (the world's most enthralling book) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at my start point, then compared about 12,000 binary digits in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tables and in my subjects' responses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A lot of pain later (didn't have a computer in 1984, had to do it all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by hand), out pops the predicted correlation between run score 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; variance and self-reported motivation, at the 0.005 confidence level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; To those of you not well versed in experimental design, that means I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; predicted the correlation ahead of time, and the first time I did the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; experiment, it turned up and if the effect was pure fluke, then it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a 1 in 200 chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But what a bitchin' result!  All those guesses matching up with some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; predetermined random numbers in a book, with the only degree of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; freedom being the seed point into the book!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Darned if I can make sense of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Richard Loosemore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can get results significant at the 1 in 200 chance level,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can predict lottery numbers well enough to double your money on each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; round.  It's the same amount of Shannon information.  All you need to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is declare that you will generate the winning pseudo-random numbers from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the seed that is the winning Mega ball, or whatever, and then check in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance to see which seed's pseudo-random numbers work best.  Think of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the publicity!  You could, using these standard experimental protocols 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that produce robust and repeatable results, settle the parapsychological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate once and for all!  In a way that no one could possible deny!  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a heck of a lot of money on the side!  Just keep doubling your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money on each round until you've got a few million dollars; or poll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough subjects to get enough precognitive information to win the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lottery outright.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet somehow I amazingly predict, in advance of the data, that the very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *instant* you try to match lottery numbers instead of random numbers in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a book, the robust repeatible precognitive effect will vanish like a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beautiful but strictly imaginary snowflake falling into a bucket of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real, dirty warm water.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And on some level, you know it too, which is why you tried to match 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random numbers in a book, instead of coming up with an encoding that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would let you match the same amount of Shannon information about future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results to the winning Mega ball.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I too am disturbed by the apparent fact that parapsychological results 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass every standard test of science - and yet the same results vanish, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like tiny  sparkling droplets of dew evaporating in the searing light of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the morning sun, as soon as someone tries to use exactly the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precognition protocol to double their money in the lottery.  It means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the standard tests of science are too damn weak, and for all we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know, a lot of other &quot;statistically significant&quot; science is also junk.
</em><br>
