<p>
I don't necessarily agree that just criticizing is the most helpful way
<br>
people can contribute but as always Marc missed the whole point of my post.
<br>
He didn't answer any criticism that I made and instead resorted to personal
<br>
attacks.
<br>
<p>I have been working out my own ideas on AI and robots for longer than most
<br>
readers of this list have been alive.  I currently do have what I consider a
<br>
plan to make an AI and I have been working on this design 1/2 time for the
<br>
past 2 years.  So far, I haven't got past the tool making stage but I
<br>
haven't hid my ideas from anyone who might be interested.
<br>
<p>For the record, Michael Wilson thinks my AI ideas are simplistic and useless
<br>
and Eliezer and Brian Atkins think my ideas on friendliness are reckless and
<br>
harmful.  I didn't ask Michael to review my AI ideas but his comments were
<br>
not constructive, helpful or useful.
<br>
<p>We agree to disagree on these points and that is why I seldom post to this
<br>
list even though I read almost ever post to it.  For people who hold
<br>
differing views on some topics, only hostile personal attacks seem to be the
<br>
end result.
<br>
<p>When I have something constructive to add for everyone's attention, I can
<br>
assure you I will share my thoughts.  I do send emails privately to people
<br>
from the list when I don't think my comments will be welcomed by the whole
<br>
list.  Maybe a few more people on this list should do the same!
<br>
<p>The website that contains my ideas on AI is at www.rccconsulting.com/ai.htm
<br>
for any that might be interested.
