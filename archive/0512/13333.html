<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Could you say which of the journals that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cited in my last message you have consulted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None. And how many times has an article In Nature or Science or Physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Review Letters or Cell or New England Journal of Medicine or Lancet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cited ANYTHING in ANY of the “journals” you mentioned? None. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Consider the idea that there may be some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;causes&quot; that are not local in this universe. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If everything caused something to happen it’s almost equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying nothing caused it. An electron went through the left slot not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right because of what an atom in the Andromeda galaxy 2 million light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years away was doing, and it was doing what it did because of an atom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Hydra cluster 8 billion light years away. For me to predict what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electron will do I’d have to know all there is to know about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe; I am comfortable in calling that random  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You set up a quantum-event controlled random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number generator (the numbers coming out are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determined by exact timing of the decay events
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of a radioactive substance, for example).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now you ask a person to try to influence it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make certain numbers come out more often.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now suppose that the first time you try the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiment, the numbers are indeed grossly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skewed in the desired direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Was it random?  No, it wasn't. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And how do you know it was random or not? I hit a golf ball 300 yards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it lands on a blade of grass, the possibility the ball will land on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that blade is extremely remote, but there it is. Somebody is going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; win the lottery.    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Did it have a normal-physics cause?  No:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; quantum mechanics states that nothing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can bias the radiocative decays to happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; according to certain pattern.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you were to actually do this and most importantly it was repeatable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you have found a flaw in Quantum Mechanics, you will have found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the radioactive decay can be influenced by something, in this case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mental state of the experimenter and so unlike what we had thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radioactive decay is not random but deterministic. If that happened then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any halfway intelligent person would admit that psi existed and we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be having this debate. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that would not change the fact that everything, absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positively 100% everything happens because of cause and effect OR it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not, and if it does not then it is random.    
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the exact connection between &quot;thought&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effect seems to come and go, sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; working and sometimes not, sometimes doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the opposite of what you planned, sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fading away if you get bored and do the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiment too many times.  This is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I meant by capricious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It’s an odd coincidence that capriciousness is exactly precisely what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would expect to see if the psi phenomena were one big load of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridicules stinking crap.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; BULLSHIT! COSMIC ASTRONOMICAL BULLSHIT!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Could you explain in more detail what you mean by this?   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I’m really sorry if you don’t understand what I was trying to say, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought my meaning was clear, but apparently not. I just don’t know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to express my opinion more directly. I wish I were more eloquent. Sorry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who was the guy who came up with the theory of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; continental drift?  Was it Wegener?  Is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; study of the history of science as patchy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; selective as your grasp of current research? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or would you care to put, alongside your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; account of Roentgen, an account of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happened to Wegener as well? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK. Alfred Wegener published his theory of continental drift in 1915 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was correct, but it was not well received. Like Roentgen he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, like Roentgen he had no theoretical explanation for what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claimed to see, like Roentgen he made an extraordinary claim, but unlike
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Roentgen he did not have extraordinary evidence, he did not have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent of a photograph of the bones in his wife’s hand. And I’ve got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to tell you, the fact that Wegener was not a geologist but a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meteorologist would not add to his credibility if I were a professional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; geologist. It took 45 years to come up with good enough evidence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince people that he was right, and that is a dismal record I think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish the scientific community had done better. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One the other hand people have believed in the paranormal for many many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of years, about as long as humans have been human; but in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that time they have never been able to produce, ironclad, excellent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good, pretty good, or even mediocre evidence that the phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People have investigated it with the Scientific Method, or claimed they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done so, for well over a century. The net result of all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intense effort is, drum roll please, is, is, is,…… precisely nothing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After more than a century of vigorous research parapsychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; “scientists” have contributed exactly precisely nothing to the sum total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human knowledge. ZERO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just between you and me, I think it’s time to move on to something else.
