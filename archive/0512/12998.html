<p>
<em>&gt; While you say it goes without saying that &quot;[exponentially increasing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence] will occur more rapidly and by means other than natural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection&quot;, you aren't sufficiently defining the effect this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entails.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Your analogy makes incorrect implicit assumptions. First of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refer to the mechanism I proposed for verifying Friendliness, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, unlike in the case of the analogy were you talk about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the airport 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security doing ineffectual guesswork in order to prevent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disaster, i'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about putting the passengers to sleep, reading through their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories to check out their intentions, uploading them into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where they think they are boarding the plane for real and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watch to make sure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't do anything bad, and then waking them back up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again without them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even knowing it happened...
</em><br>
<p>You comments above are all we need to prove that you agree:
<br>
<p>In specific &quot;exponentially increasing&quot; intelligence, and
<br>
&quot;reading their memories&quot;.  You cannot do the later NOW
<br>
for human being or even approach this computationally
<br>
(ignoring technical barriers of method), and you seem to
<br>
think you can do this for an expenentially increasing 
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>The Singularity if that is what you are considering is 
<br>
precisely that:  A Singularity beyond which you can
<br>
guarantee nothing.
<br>
<p>If we are discussing a human level AI, which may remain
<br>
on this side of the Singularity for some finite and
<br>
interesting amount of time, then there is plenty of
<br>
room for friendly and unfriendly AI.
<br>
<p>Even if YOU create what YOU believe to be a perfectly
<br>
friendly AI, you will almost to a practical certainty 
<br>
find some people (large groups of people) who think your
<br>
AI is unfriendly to THEM.
<br>
<p>Again, the do you propose that you will consider a
<br>
friendly AI created by the US government (a very 
<br>
high probabability candidate, especially the NSA as
<br>
they tend to have the most advance computers and
<br>
algorithms, almost anachronistically) to be friendly
<br>
by YOUR standards?
<br>
<p>How about any other government?  Or corporatin? 
<br>
Microsoft, IBM, and others with similar interest in
<br>
hardware and software are additional likely candidates
<br>
for the first &quot;Friendly AI&quot;.  How do you feel about
<br>
Microsoft's idea of friendly?
<br>
<p>Or mine? 
<br>
<p>Or Al Qaeda?  (For that matter how does Al Qaeda feel
<br>
about the friendliness of the Pentagon's Friendly AI
<br>
that figures out all of their hiding places and connecdtions?)
<br>
<p>And that latter capability is being actively worked on....
<br>
<p>You can TRY (and should) to develop (or encourage the 
<br>
development of) friendly AI, but it cannot be guaranteed.
<br>
<p>Beyond the singularity is unknowable territory (thus the
<br>
name) and in front of the singularity are competing groups
<br>
of human beings with different goals and ideas of 
<br>
friendliness.
