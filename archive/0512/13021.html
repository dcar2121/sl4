<em>&gt; But, the 500 x $1000 (or a few thousand) for hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem that tough compared to your other expenses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (when you are ready).
</em><br>
<p>Agreed
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does the above presume (any of) the following:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        1) The approximate 1000 fold increase in computing power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                (at any particular price point) that 15 years may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                bring?
</em><br>
<p>It assumes perhaps a 10-fold increase over this time period, not a
<br>
1000-fold increase
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        2) Appreciably more RAM per PC than is common today?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                (1 to a few GB are now common) or perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                must faster (and larger) disk drives which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                perform well enough to substitute for current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                RAM?
</em><br>
<p>Well, appreciably more RAM per PC would help a lot but is not
<br>
necessary.  Novamente is a distributed architecture, but of course
<br>
minimizing distributed-ness speeds things up a lot hence decreasing
<br>
the number of machines required...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        3) A large number of &quot;breakthoughs&quot; in AI technique?
</em><br>
<p>No, just a lot of small discoveries and a lot of &quot;tuning&quot; within the
<br>
existing Novamente AI architecture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        4) Any significantly &quot;hard&quot; breakthroughs?
</em><br>
<p>Not really...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        5) Adult-level &quot;scientist&quot; AI is also a &quot;programmer&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                (i.e., able to program and learn how to program
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                better.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the end goal...
<br>
