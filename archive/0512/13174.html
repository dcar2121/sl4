<p>Ah, the difficulties of precise discussion using imprecise language.
<br>
<p>We all recognize examples of specific knowledge that may not
<br>
contribute to specific problem cases.  We also recognize that some
<br>
knowledge can lead one away from optimum approaches to problem cases. 
<br>
Our knowledge is fundamentally imperfect and incomplete, but the
<br>
question is whether increasingly objective knowledge *tends to*
<br>
increase capability to promote an agent's values, and thus this
<br>
tendency toward increasing knowledge is necessarily good (from the
<br>
point of view of the agent.)
