<em>&gt;&gt; it just might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be art that makes the difference between a Prevail scenario and a Shriek.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How so?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In two capacities, short-term (ten to twenty years) and long-term (the 
<br>
singularity and beyond):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short-term: the thinking in the AGI community, especially in FAI research, 
<br>
will be influenced not only by well composed discussion, well documented 
<br>
research, and incremental AGI products whose utility raises performance 
<br>
benchmarks, but also by the fiction and art which provides new metaphores and 
<br>
modes of understanding. Mr. Chapel pointed that out in his previous e-mail. 
<br>
However, the way the community gains their memes, of any flavor, will in some 
<br>
way depend on the culture at large, as will the way in which funding is 
<br>
gained. Most importantly, the way in which the AGI's communities efforts are 
<br>
recieved will depend on the memetic landscape of the culture at large, and it 
<br>
is almost inevitable that as the singularity gets closer a cultural 
<br>
transformation will take place, perhaps a renaissance to some, certianly 
<br>
disruptive to many. The art which is being produced in this meantime will help 
<br>
sculpt the cultural transformation, and thereby affect how an FAI is produced, 
<br>
self-improved and effected on the rest of the world. The function of the best 
<br>
art is arguably to raise awareness, and awareness is something everyone from 
<br>
the AGI researcher to the guy working at 711 could use plenty of in the coming 
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long-term: in functional terms, art is simply information patterns which 
<br>
aling to a specific, presumably desirable, set of formative hueristics. Since 
<br>
a post-human civilization's likely endeavor will be to generate new informatic 
<br>
patterns, in some way or another, the best way to avoid nasty existential 
<br>
dillemas like the Halting Problem (say to an algorithm seeking to generate all 
<br>
possible experiences) is to incorporate aesthetic concerns into the underlying 
<br>
mechanisms. Its relatable to the classic &quot;intelligence doesn't equal wisdom&quot; 
<br>
hypothesis. What we really want out of recursively improving intelligence is 
<br>
greater wisdom, with the associated benifits, and that means that the increase 
<br>
in informatic content generation must be accompanied by an increase in 
<br>
hueristic integrity and, perhaps, beauty.
