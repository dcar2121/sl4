</em><br>
<p>If you can get results significant at the 1 in 200 chance level,
<br>
you can predict lottery numbers well enough to double your money on each 
<br>
round.  It's the same amount of Shannon information.  All you need to do is 
<br>
declare that you will generate the winning pseudo-random numbers from the 
<br>
seed that is the winning Mega ball, or whatever, and then check in advance 
<br>
to see which seed's pseudo-random numbers work best.  Think of the 
<br>
publicity!  You could, using these standard experimental protocols that 
<br>
produce robust and repeatable results, settle the parapsychological debate 
<br>
once and for all!  In a way that no one could possible deny!  And make a 
<br>
heck of a lot of money on the side!  Just keep doubling your money on each 
<br>
round until you've got a few million dollars; or poll enough subjects to 
<br>
get enough precognitive information to win the lottery outright.
<br>
<p>Yet somehow I amazingly predict, in advance of the data, that the very 
<br>
*instant* you try to match lottery numbers instead of random numbers in a 
<br>
book, the robust repeatible precognitive effect will vanish like a 
<br>
beautiful but strictly imaginary snowflake falling into a bucket of real, 
<br>
dirty warm water.
<br>
<p>And on some level, you know it too, which is why you tried to match random 
<br>
numbers in a book, instead of coming up with an encoding that would let you 
<br>
match the same amount of Shannon information about future results to the 
<br>
winning Mega ball.
<br>
<p>I too am disturbed by the apparent fact that parapsychological results pass 
<br>
every standard test of science - and yet the same results vanish, like tiny 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;sparkling droplets of dew evaporating in the searing light of the morning 
<br>
sun, as soon as someone tries to use exactly the same precognition protocol 
<br>
to double their money in the lottery.  It means that the standard tests of 
<br>
science are too damn weak, and for all we know, a lot of other 
<br>
&quot;statistically significant&quot; science is also junk.
