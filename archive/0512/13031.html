<em>&gt; So if somebody let you have one of these you'd be happy?

<em>&gt; 96 processor deskside workstation, peak performance of 230 gigaflops,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running off a single electric plug.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cost around 100,000 USD.

<em>&gt; But big savings on data centre costs, power, space, rackmounts, air

<p>This would be an excellent start, indeed.
<br>
<p>Care to trade one to Novamente LLC in exchange for some shares in the
<br>
company?  Send me a private email and we'll talk ;-)
<br>
<p>My view is that the hardware exists for achieving AGI, and at least
<br>
one viable design exists as well (Novamente).
<br>
<p>What is missing is the availability of funds to pay a small dedicated
<br>
team to work on AGI for the required number of years (or, alternately,
<br>
an appropriately skilled and motivated team that is sufficiently
<br>
wealthy or free of responsibilities to have no need for funding).
<br>
<p>Society does not choose to allocate funds to this sort of work, and
<br>
therefore AGI may potentially be a long time coming, even though the
<br>
needed hardware and designs exists.
<br>
<p>This is unfortunate in my view, but far from unprecedented in human
<br>
history.  Many substantial advances have taken longer than necessary
<br>
to eventuate due to lack of appropriate vision on the part of
<br>
society's resource-holders.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, all it would take would be one wealthy individual
<br>
or corporation with the vision to significantly fund Novamente (or
<br>
some analogous advanced AGI project, if any exist), to change the
<br>
picture substantially.  Or else the advent of say 5-6 individuals with
<br>
no income requirements and a mastery of both software engineering and
<br>
AI theory, with the motivation to spend years of their lives working
<br>
uncompensated toward AGI and the Singularity.
<br>
<p>You never know...
<br>
<p>It is a source of great regret to me that, when I did get a fair bit
<br>
of money for AI development (in the late 90's), the AI design I had
<br>
then was half-baked and overcomplex.  (Not that it was bad -- with
<br>
sufficient refinement it would have worked -- but it was so complex
<br>
that the refinement process was too time-consuming and
<br>
labor-intensive.)  Now that I have a much better AGI design in hand
<br>
and a partial implementation, I find the economy is in a much more
<br>
pessimistic state and funds are much harder to come by.  We are making
<br>
steady progress toward the end goal, but with the current level of
<br>
work that is being focused on the project, the progress is
<br>
frustratingly slow.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In fact they don't strictly assume ANY increase in computing power,
