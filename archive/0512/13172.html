<em>&gt; I am entirely at a loss to know how what you just wrote bears on the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What *I* wrote was meaningless upon deeper inspection???
</em><br>
<p>Well, my statement would have been self-contradictory if it said what
<br>
you thought it might have.  Since I started by calling them &quot;astute
<br>
points&quot;, then it would not be likely that I would proceed to refer to
<br>
them as &quot;meaningless upon further inspection.&quot;  Much more likely that
<br>
I meant you made astute points about (poorly defined concepts that are
<br>
meaningless upon deeper inspection.)  Namely, goal statements like
<br>
&quot;thinking is good&quot;.
<br>
<p>I was *supporting* you.  Is that so unusual in your experience that
<br>
you don't easily recognize it when it occurs?
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I am not sure what your suggest below is directed at.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clarification?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, it seems very clear to me.  I don't know what kind of
<br>
clarification you want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [more on evolving understanding]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am increasingly frustrated by the observation and experience that on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the various transhumanist lists, a graph of posting frequency by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individual would show a hump, with those who have enthusiastic but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relatively incomplete thinking posting far more than those who have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more coherent views or those who may not have strong views at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is to be expected, but it tends to promote regression to the mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; more than leading-edge growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Creative growth requires diverse input, but mining these transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lists for nuggets of leading edge ideas, or planting seeds of thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when a fertile opportunity seems to be presented, provides such sparse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; payback that I and many others question whether we've long since past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the point of diminishing returns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think we've reached the point that we need new tools--an improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; framework--for collaborative thinking including concept mapping,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argument mapping, and shared knowledge that goes qualitatively beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the wiki and the email list.  I don't have the available bandwidth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; create this or even to organize such a project, and I see it coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just around the corner with all the growing awareness of &quot;web 2.0&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; social software, but I would be very interested in contributing some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time and resources to such a project.
