<em>&gt;&gt;What *I* wrote was meaningless upon deeper inspection???

<em>&gt; Well, my statement would have been self-contradictory if it said what
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; points&quot;, then it would not be likely that I would proceed to refer to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I meant you made astute points about (poorly defined concepts that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningless upon deeper inspection.)  Namely, goal statements like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;thinking is good&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was *supporting* you.  Is that so unusual in your experience that

</em><br>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I wasn't upset by your comments, just momentarily 
<br>
befuddled and confused! :-)  I really could not tell.  Perhaps I was in 
<br>
too much of a rush (I had to upanchor and move from one coffee shop to 
<br>
another at that point).
<br>
<p>And, to answer your question:  YES!, sad as it seems, since I came onto 
<br>
the SL4 list it really has been unusual for me to get replies that are 
<br>
supportive.  All part of the problem you mentioned, of course.
<br>
<p>Not just that, but when the ad-hominem attack comes, it often arrives in 
<br>
the form of statements that are incoherent in themselves, or which pay 
<br>
me the backhanded compliment of saying that I wrote eloquently about 
<br>
ideas that were complete rubbish.  Sigh!
<br>
<p><p>Anyhow, see separate post (just submitted) for my modest attempt to 
<br>
suggest a way forward.
