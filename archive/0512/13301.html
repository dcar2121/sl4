</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to interject a couple of comments into this [lost?] debate 
<br>
about free will etc.
<br>
<p>I can speak from personal experience as someone who is BOTH heavily 
<br>
committed to the strong AI thesis (i.e. I believe that computers can be 
<br>
programmed to have genuine consciousness) AND who is also a former 
<br>
parapsychology experimentalist.  In other words, I once did some 
<br>
carefully controlled experiments to investigate telepathy, precognition etc.
<br>
<p>My conclusions from the parapsychology work is that I personally have 
<br>
very strong evidence that there is _something_ going on out there that 
<br>
is not encompassed by normal science.  (I don't care to try to justify 
<br>
this to anyone else anymore because the eventual response from skeptics 
<br>
is that experimenter deceipt is a satisfactory explanation for the 
<br>
results that I got, and that is rather tedious if you are the experimenter).
<br>
<p>What this means for consciousness, free will, etc. is that the whole 
<br>
debate is not going to be settled by pure thought alone:  for example, 
<br>
it is possible that conscious systems have effects on the world that are 
<br>
grossly at odds with the the &quot;cause and effect&quot; pattern that we see in 
<br>
normal science.... they could simply bias the other random events in the 
<br>
world to happen in a particular way, and the nature of the bias could 
<br>
end up being opaque to further analysis.
<br>
<p>So at the end of the day, I find all debates about consciousness and 
<br>
free will are premature.  If you want to find out more, do some 
<br>
experiments and collect more data, don't rely on pure thought and reasoning.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
