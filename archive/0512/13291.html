<em>&gt; Oops.  I meant to use the term telepathic, not the term psychic.  As in,
</em><br>
if consciousness is strictly emergent from computation and not substrate, we
<br>
should be aware of all sentient activities along the surface area of our
<br>
light-cones, not merely our own minds.  I was attempting to dismiss the
<br>
uploading meme; it is one of the first ideas thrust upon H+ newcomers.  If
<br>
two computers cannot read eachothers programming, why would a person's saved
<br>
upload be able to interact with the original in any way?  In both scenarios
<br>
the substrate forms boundaries.
<br>
<p>It's not a case of the upload interacting with the original, it's a case of
<br>
the upload being an equivalent instantiation to the original. It's not that
<br>
substrate matters, just that computation must occur in some physical
<br>
substrate. As to being aware of the computation outside ourselves, we're not
<br>
even aware of most computation inside ourselves, in truth there's more of
<br>
self-ignorance in us than self-awareness.
<br>
<p>The upload problem is like one of the forms of the teleport problem. Say you
<br>
have means to transmit an exact copy (ignore QM issues for the sake of
<br>
argument here) of a person through an information channel, from place A to
<br>
place B, but the process is destructive. A person P at place A wishes to go
<br>
to place B. The person can either continuously move from A to B as we do
<br>
every day, or be transmited through the information channel, and
<br>
reconstituted at B, with perfect accuracy. What has happened to P? Is P
<br>
still P? Is it alive? Has it ever died?
<br>
<p>In the case of uploading, this same information is collected about P, and
<br>
instead of P being transmited through an information channel and
<br>
reconstituted at B, P is reconstituted at A+, which is a virtual environment
<br>
simulated on a computer. Since, if you accept that P can be transmited from
<br>
A to B, you are already conceding that P is an essentially informational
<br>
object, what makes it impossible to instantiate P at A+? Your idea that
<br>
there's some magic in physics that generates self awareness is not supported
<br>
by any data. Information is what we can identify as making the difference.
<br>
Even if there were some quirk of physics, why could it not be emulated, same
<br>
as any other quirk of physics?
<br>
