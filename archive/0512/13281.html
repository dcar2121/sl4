<em>&gt; &quot;Gods&quot; existing outside of our universe won't be formed of 
</em><br>
carbon-based brains and so won't even be conscious, right? I mean, if new 
<br>
universes can only be created in a way that marginally shifts the likelyhood 
<br>
they will not be hell-worlds downwards... the gods seem weak. The way I see 
<br>
it, the singularity happened when the last ice-age subsided 10000 years!
<br>
<em>&gt; ago.
</em><br>
<p>A bit from a blog I read, which has nothing explicetedly to do with this 
<br>
conversation, keyed me into the nature of what you're saying, which makes me 
<br>
thing you may be onto something about the &quot;gods&quot;. The context of this bit is 
<br>
in relations to a conversation the blog author had with a guitarist about a 
<br>
loop pedal's performance, but its explicit message has something to it:
<br>
<p>&quot;If you decide to do what I do, and by all means you should because it's 
<br>
a great way to practice and build a sense of rhythm, learn this well: the loop 
<br>
does not change. It does not slow down. It does not speed up. That is the 
<br>
whole point of a loop. And because it is mindless, the loop is god.&quot;
<br>
<p>Maybe &quot;god&quot; in the evolutionary Type VII sense, is mindless and god 
<br>
simultaneously, due to the blind prodecurality of its optimization process. 
<br>
This would suggest that in the process of absolute transcension a civilization 
<br>
receeds &quot;mind&quot; in favor of &quot;being&quot;, that is a Type VII civilization becomes so 
<br>
advanced that it decides to receed intelligent design in favor of a more 
<br>
pervasive mode of creation, one which is primal, mindless and unbound. In this 
<br>
manner the both sides of the Fermi Paradox equation cancle out to a zero-sum, 
<br>
intelligence goes to zero as influence goes to infinity. Or vice versa, in the 
<br>
case of inward development. Whether we are the first form of intelligent life 
<br>
ever, or supercivilizations have preceeded us, we are still the first form of 
<br>
intelligent life as far as we're concerned.
