<em>&gt; But, this is just not the case.  I spent ALL of my considerable effort

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; details of an actual experiment that I conducted.  Heck, I tried to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ANYONE to talk about the real research!  The abusive behavior was
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was not.
</em><br>
<p>Well I appreciate the effort, to elevate the discussion, certainly,
<br>
but that's not exactly what I meant. It's true that you've been much
<br>
more polite and referenced far more places to look for third-party
<br>
confirmation, but that doesn't make the discussion much more
<br>
scientific. More grounded, perhaps more scholarly. But what was
<br>
entirely opaque to me, was what the actual fact or process being
<br>
supposedly argued was supossed to be?
<br>
<p>In my eyes the whole discussion was a rather over-ambitious and hence
<br>
useless pissing match attempting to ESTABLISH somehow the
<br>
existence/non-existence of &quot;psi&quot;in general. The fact that you were
<br>
being more polite about it doesn't make things any better, for my
<br>
view. Arguing for a whole category is strange and certainly not
<br>
scientific.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, this is unfair.  I mentioned the serious research that exists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that I had done some of it.  I and the other serious researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were then insulted as &quot;witch doctors&quot;, a non-scientific fools,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;third-rate scientists&quot;, etc.  The careful and thoughtful replies I gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the beginning (when I was ignoring the abuse) were then met with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words like:   &lt;snip list/&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You described this as a &quot;poor reception&quot;.  I don't think so.
</em><br>
<p>Well John K Clark is a blunt fellow certainly, personally I've always
<br>
appreciated the agressive intellectually macho tone around here, but
<br>
it can get in the way. My impression again was that the &quot;discussion&quot;
<br>
consisted of tennis-ball assertions, and the fact that you were much
<br>
more &quot;polite&quot; and injured isn't relevant unless it bears on the facts
<br>
of the argument,,i.e. &quot;you are wrong because you suck&quot; is ad hominem
<br>
and poor arguing, whereas &quot;you are wrong because X, and you suck&quot; is
<br>
merely being rude, and not actually covered by list rules.
<br>
<p>I'm willing to bite here, although I'm confident about the question of
<br>
psi, but I'm interested in why a self-described scientist like
<br>
yourself,who seems measured and intelligent, (if a little huffy) would
<br>
spend so much energy defending such matters in this context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The subject came up in the context of consciousness and free will.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a valid question to ask whether parapsychology has relevance to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contruction of AGI systems.
</em><br>
<p>Well this would be where you may, if you wish, make this a more
<br>
scientific discussion. Are you proposing any factor, which falls under
<br>
the rubric of &quot;psi&quot; and is thus scientifically unrecognized, which has
<br>
implications for an AI researcher like myself? And that being the
<br>
case, is there a way we can determine if this is so?
