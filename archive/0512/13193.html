Yes Jef.  I think we agree.
<br>
I think that there are several problems here relating to being understood 
<br>
though.
<br>
The first, real humans are not agents.  Rather, they act *slightly* 
<br>
agent-like at least a little of the time.  Agency is immensely powerful, and 
<br>
civilization is the result.  However, a consequence of this is that almost 
<br>
all people have no model of agency, and fail to understand it at all.  (are 
<br>
Role Playing Games effectively training in understanding agency?)
<br>
The second problem is that among those few who understand agency we often 
<br>
have a &quot;virtue and sanity&quot; cargo cult.  It is correct that certain beliefs, 
<br>
assertions, and preferences, such as the belief that the world is about to 
<br>
end, that one is uniquely or almost uniquely capable of saving it, or that 
<br>
one no longer needs traditional morality are extremely good empirically 
<br>
validated predictors of harmful behavior.  It is likewise true that in the 
<br>
Pacific Islands in the 1940s airstrips were good empirically validated 
<br>
predictors of food delivery.  The refusal to formally adopt agency in place 
<br>
of evolved morality despite the knowledge that morality is evolved for a 
<br>
radically different environment because morality's rejection has predicted 
<br>
destructive behavior in the past is thus similar to building airstrips after 
<br>
the food deliveries have stopped, especially since agency, properly 
<br>
understood, encompasses fully that part of evolved moral behavior that (due 
<br>
to it's self-referential nature and connection to your goal system) you wish 
<br>
to retain.  Similar things can be said about the refusal to adopt any 
<br>
particular far-from-appearent-consensus belief, especially beliefs regarding 
<br>
the low rationality, agency (ironically), or competence of accepted 
<br>
high-status authorities.  Admittedly, the warmth of evolved morality, 
<br>
agreement with consensus, and high regard for the leaders/authorities of 
<br>
one's society are features of one's goal system, so I am counciling a sort 
<br>
of self-sacrifice, but more properly I am counciling that certain goals be 
<br>
temporarily deferred for the sake of the long term, for without doing so 
<br>
those goals will fail to be realized in the more distant future.  Students 
<br>
of psychology should be at least as aware of the need to avoid hyperbolic 
<br>
discounting as students of history should be of insanity, especially given 
<br>
that the actual expected cost of insanity is so low (for most forms of 
<br>
insanity, only one relatively normal human life worth of utility plus a bit 
<br>
extra is at stake).
<br>
<p>Tennessee.  The vast majority of FAI and UFAI designs are, at equilibrium, 
<br>
consequentialist rational agents, but NOT objectivitst.  They are 
<br>
consequentialist because without consequentialism, goals can drift, but 
<br>
consequentialism is a black hole from which goals cannot, under ordinary 
<br>
circumstances, drift.
<br>
They are NOT objectivists because except in rare cases they aren't even 
<br>
expected to have a &quot;Self&quot; to be self-interested in.  Perfectly in violation 
<br>
of the categorical imperitive, they will see everything as a means to an end 
<br>
like all consequentialists do.
