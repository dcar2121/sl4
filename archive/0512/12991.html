<p>Ben, I think you might be giving Marc more credit than he deserves.  I could
<br>
make a program that spewed out a bunch of rubbish on philosophical and
<br>
meta-physical topics and some smart people could pick out some interesting
<br>
lines here and there.  These few lines might be insightful to their
<br>
intelligent minds where the rest of the text was discarded as rubbish.  The
<br>
program couldn't be considered intelligent at all and if not for the
<br>
intelligence of the reader, nothing of value could come from this randomly
<br>
created text.  I believe this is what Marc Geddes does.  If Marc can't back
<br>
up any of this hypothesis or insights with something other than he believes
<br>
it might be true, then what difference does it make if something he says
<br>
might be correct by accident.  Does he get credit for something that he
<br>
never intended or understood?
<br>
<p>When Marc first put out his TOE, I sent a few responses directly to him (off
<br>
list).  Most of what I wrote was asking him to provide the reasoning for his
<br>
conclusions.  His response was to come up with a fresh set of gibberish
<br>
without answering any of my complaints or comments at all.  He has done this
<br>
consistently on this list for all the time I have been reading it.  (I have
<br>
246 posts by Marc since February 25, 2004) Even the people who have tried to
<br>
agree with him on some minor point have been told that they weren't
<br>
expressing his opinions correctly and he would then add more conclusions
<br>
without any reasons or facts to base such conclusions on.
<br>
<p>If Marc isn't an idiot then he is at least a waste of time to read because
<br>
he ignores any reasoned arguments that are ever posted in reply to his
<br>
posts.  He includes all kinds of smiley faces when what he is saying isn't
<br>
humorous at all and he fancies that he is in some kind of competition with
<br>
Eliezer.  Doesn't a competition between 2 people have to have both parties
<br>
participate to be called a competition?  Eliezer, rightly, has ignored these
<br>
repeated challenges from Marc.  The image of a delusional knight charging at
<br>
windmills comes to mind.
<br>
<p>I have also been quite annoyed by many on this list for their nasty way of
<br>
replying to new posters and others they disagree with.  For a list that
<br>
purports to have almost exclusively very intelligent people on it, I have a
<br>
hard time discerning the logic and rationality of many posts.  Is it
<br>
difficult for someone to make a proposition and then follow it with
<br>
arguments as to why they think the proposition is true?  Is it difficult for
<br>
others to refute or agree with that exact same proposition and explain why
<br>
they believe it to be wrong or right?  Many people seem to reply to another
<br>
person's proposition with a different one of their own and then refute that
<br>
instead of the other persons'.  This talking past each other has been
<br>
mentioned by others on this list.  Wouldn't putting a little more structure
<br>
into our posts and responses make the information to signal ratio go up
<br>
substantially?
<br>
<p>As a side note, I think Eliezer's comments about SL4 and transhumanism not
<br>
being a cult were very good and right on the money.
<br>
<p>David Clark
