From: Ben Goertzel
<br>
<p>&lt;snip past discussion&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, you could look at Minsky's chapter in this book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://llt.msu.edu/vol1num1/reviews/hal.html">http://llt.msu.edu/vol1num1/reviews/hal.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Thank you.   I was particularly amused by the review's
<br>
mention of HAL's &quot;lip reading capabilities&quot; reference the 
<br>
findings that conventional speech recognition systems
<br>
can be improved by 10-50% through a visual model.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or (when it finally comes out in a few months) my forthcoming edited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volume on AGI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.springer.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,,4-147-22-43950079-0,00.html">http://www.springer.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,,4-147-22-43950079-0,00.html</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ok, I will look forward to it.
<br>
<p>Do you have any particular references (preferably online)
<br>
for &quot;text summarization&quot; -- that is, the ability to extract
<br>
summaries or to paraphrase text and information?
<br>
<p>(This is a field that interests me greatly.  Along with
<br>
the idea of programs that write and optimize programs
<br>
seems to be where much of the leverage can be found; and
<br>
where my own VERY modest efforts are directed.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But, be warned that one possibility for this is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'someone' (like the NSA) is actively discouraging such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; work and at the same time is offering strong incentives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for those who can and do pursue it to be &quot;one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; family&quot; and keep such research under security veil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know enough about both the AI field and the intel community to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this is very unlikely to be true; but I realize there is no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to convince you that it isn't true, if you choose to maintain this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief.
</em><br>
<p>Your testimony is evidence, a very useful data point, 
<br>
and worthy of consideration, perhaps even tentative belief.
<br>
<p>[It was only a possibility in any case -- it did happen
<br>
in the cryptography/cryptanalysis fields for many years.]
<br>
<p>Personally I maintain few beliefs to a 100% level, but
<br>
must act as if that is the case (when the level is in 
<br>
the high 9s) to operate actively and coherently in the 
<br>
real world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Al Qaeda?  Or some rogue nation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No chance -- those countries have very little technological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advancement
</em><br>
<p>It was merely an example to cause thought -- India
<br>
also comes to mind, also  Taiwan, Singapore, or China
<br>
are candidates -- not a claim that any of these would 
<br>
be the developer, nor was it a suggestion for bookies 
<br>
who wish to handicap the field.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is unlikely that a &quot;maverick breakthrough&quot; will have much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effect until hardware increases by several orders of magnitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And what evidence do you have for THIS assertion?  As someone actively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved with AGI design, I am not nearly so sure as you are of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this....
</em><br>
<p>I don't have any strong evidence, except a general (weak)
<br>
belief that we are going to need to approach, maybe exceed,
<br>
the capacity of the human brain to reach a comparable 
<br>
(human level) AI.
<br>
<p>It is of course possible that optimizations (not possible
<br>
in our evolutionary constructed brains) will reduce these
<br>
requirements radically.  It is also possible substitution for
<br>
neuro-transmitters and other non-connectionist human 
<br>
hardware may increase the requirements.
<br>
<p>[And evidence for such computer advantages includes the 
<br>
clear fact that computer memories are much more accurate 
<br>
than human memories for simple facts; also they are much 
<br>
more accurate for pure calculations and even in symbolic 
<br>
math they can bee much better than all but a rare few 
<br>
mathematicians.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And, those with the hardware will have the first chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to actually try any such breakthroughs....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're making an unjustified assumption about the hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirements of a successful AGI design.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I was presuming a certain level of hardware beyond that
<br>
commonly available or even beyond that available on state of
<br>
the art machines such as Blue Gene.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Based on my current estimates (which are based on the capabilities of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own Novamente AI system when run on a handful of machines), the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minimum hardware requirements for an AGI are not *less* than a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred commodity PC's ... but I am not sure they are more than this. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And a few hundred PC's are not all that expensive to network together.
</em><br>
<p>You are in a much better position to know, and even 1000 PCs are
<br>
not a particularly difficult barrier.  
<br>
<p>If that will do it, then the most advanced machines already
<br>
have far more than the minimum hardware requirements.
<br>
<p>We could probably setup a &quot;SETI @ Home&quot; like network and garner
<br>
a few thousand actively participating (at any one time) machines
<br>
if network delays would not be a serious problem to such
<br>
algorithms.
<br>
<p>Note: I mean far more than 1000 PCs, but with at least this
<br>
many active consistently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- Ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would love to hear more about how you see current (and near
<br>
future hardware) doing this....
<br>
<p>This would move the singularity into the realm of &quot;real soon
<br>
now&quot;, rather than 10-30 years in the future.
