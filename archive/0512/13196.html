<em>&gt;Any intelligence which is conscious and aware of that consciousness 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;certainly would have a self.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Hume and Siddhartha would beg to differ, but I would simply ask what 
<br>
you mean by &quot;conscious&quot; and why it is relevant to talk about &quot;consciousness&quot; 
<br>
when thinking about intelligences in general?  Evolution is certainly an 
<br>
effective optimization process, but not a conscious one.
<br>
<p>The category &quot;Intelligent Processes&quot; is the super-category which includes 
<br>
both human minds and evolution, and processes as different from both as they 
<br>
are from one another, including all possible GAIs.  Unless you understand 
<br>
that, anthropomorphising from your sense of what &quot;conscious&quot; implies is 
<br>
harmful to your understanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I argue that sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;powerful AGI must have self consciousness because such an intelligence, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order to be sufficiently intelligent, must be able to add its own agency as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one aspect of the system that it is modeling (reality).
</em><br>
<p>The above is all clearly true, but none of it implies anything like what the 
<br>
mental model of a &quot;self&quot; that you and many others seem to be using.  Rather, 
<br>
an entity must model it &quot;self&quot; if it is to self-improve and if it is to be 
<br>
able to judge &quot;improvements&quot;.  The model it uses of its &quot;self&quot; may be 
<br>
identical to the model it would use for any process it found externally 
<br>
which behaved in the same manner and which it had the same information 
<br>
about, or at least far more similar than the model of self used by a human 
<br>
is to the human's other models.
<br>
<p>A strongly suspected feature of Intelligent Processes of sufficient power is 
<br>
that they will converge to a potentially Friendly and otherwise omnicidal 
<br>
&quot;Really Powerful Optimization Processes&quot; because consistant &quot;improvement&quot; 
<br>
requires a well-ordered preference structure.
<br>
<p>It is important to note that to a great extent &quot;morality&quot; is an attempt for 
<br>
agents with competing preference structures to generate a well ordered 
<br>
aggregate preference structure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now if this is true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i.e. that real AGI must be self-aware, then it would be highly dangerous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a bunch of super intelligent AGI running around treating people as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means to an end alone. Note that it is ok to treat a person as means to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end as long as that action can be justified as also being an end in itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also I contend that if an AGI is self-aware that it must be programmed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand that it is not just an individual but part of a collective which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is human civilization and part of its goal system should be in service to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this collective. This is not just true for machines but for people as well.
</em><br>
<p>Until you understand what powerful optimization processes are, you won't 
<br>
have any idea what &quot;highly dangerous&quot; means by SL4 standards.
