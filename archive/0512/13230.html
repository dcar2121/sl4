how is a rational individual free?  he is bound by his rationality which is
<br>
ultimately the product of unchosen factors.  People  ARE very reluctant to
<br>
let go of blame

<em>&gt; If you define free-will in terms of causality then, of course, there is no

</em><br>
<em>&gt; free-will and it really has nothing to do with causality. The issue, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think, is in what faculty of the mind governs a person's actions - instinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or reason. We all know people who's lives are governed by instinct almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusively. these people act more like animals than people. The truly free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual is the rational individual. It is a state of consciousness that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be achieved. The ability to achieve this state of rationality may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by a combination of genetics and environment, but nevertheless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that person is 'self-determinate'. This idea is the crux of almost all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; German philosophy - everything from Kant's categorical Imperative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nietzsche's Will to Power. Man is a being who has the power to direct his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own actions based on reason (modelling the universe and acting toward a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-goal). This same idea can be found also in the theology of St. Paul.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paul who constantly makes references to the bondage of the flesh (instinct)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and admonishes his followers to &quot;take the mind of Christ&quot; (rationality) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to gain freedom over the bondage.

<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;S&quot; is meaningless.  Proof of Free-will is physics, not philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure, free-will (if it exists) must be derived from unchosen factors because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it is possible to trace the chain of causality backwards to when *you* were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just your Dad's cumshot and your Mom's ova.  In my model, somewhere around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; E(one billion), you are two years old and your neurons are on the verge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; firing; you are deciding whether or not to eat paint.  The 1st time you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sampled paint (E-500 million), it was inevitable.  This time around your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain isn't sure.  Part of your decision is based upon your memory of tastes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you like.  You remember that you enjoyed the taste of paint and would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to experience the qualia again.  When whether or not your neurons fire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depend upon electrical actions in parts of your brain that constitute self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (including memory), you are exercising free-will.  It doesn't happen too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; often (and not at all if ! this model of the brain is faulty).
