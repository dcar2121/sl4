<p>This seems an appealing, solidly commonsense objection, but only to those 
<br>
who have absolutely no knowledge of the claims actually made by 
<br>
parapsychologists today, typically in regard to observed effect sizes. It's 
<br>
the kind of comic strip objection that would be relevant if professional 
<br>
parapsychologists claimed X-Men powers, or endorsed the sorts of miracles 
<br>
that were the fodder of 1950s Astounding science-fiction stories.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, even supposing that you had the capacity to know perfectly 
<br>
and easily in advance *by ordinary means* the winning numbers of a lottery, 
<br>
I'm pretty sure there's no way to become a billionaire by using that 
<br>
knowledge. A millionaire, sure, eventually.
<br>
<p>But, as an hour or two reading the claims actually made by 
<br>
parapsychologists would demonstrate, the size of the deviations from chance 
<br>
typically encountered in traditional psi studies are of the order of one 
<br>
extra correct guess per hundred (where p is 1 in 5), if not markedly less. 
<br>
IIRC, the average PEAR deviation is of the order of one in 10,000. 
<br>
Presumably this is due to the exceptionally tedious nature of the task they 
<br>
set up, which is designed not to facilitate the purported phenomena but to 
<br>
ensure that the data is recorded and archived in a watertight manner, and 
<br>
that the analysis testing for paranormality is straightforward.
<br>
<p>The Mega Millions lottery requires you to identify five numbers out of 56 
<br>
and an additional one number out of 46. Quickly now, tell me your brilliant 
<br>
protocol for achieving this aim given a phenomenon that manifests itself as 
<br>
an excess of (at best) one extra correct guess in a hundred. It takes you 
<br>
100,000 guesses to attain one standard deviation, which is hardly enough to 
<br>
instil confidence. True, you're only risking a dollar, so you might be 
<br>
prepared to stop after 100,000 guesses.
<br>
<p>Of course, this brutal approach strips away all the inbuilt affordances of 
<br>
the human mind, so one might suppose that if psi actually exists there must 
<br>
be better ways to apply it. Thus, the development of protocols for what is 
<br>
now called remote viewing. But this, too, is a procedure -- like according 
<br>
one's memory of dreams -- prey to all kinds of noise, second-guessing, 
<br>
elaboration. There is abundant evidence that remote viewers like Joseph 
<br>
McMoneagle can do remarkably better than chance using these protocols, but 
<br>
again it's very difficult to devise a method of coding a Mega Millions 
<br>
lottery ticket into the kind of imagery identifiable by this process.
<br>
<p>I used to think it would be very easy: all you need to do is translate a 
<br>
sequence of decimal numbers into binary form and encode a binarized image 
<br>
from it as the target: dark versus light for the first one/zero, male 
<br>
versus female for the second one/zero, inside versus outside for the third 
<br>
one/zero... The problem here is that a single mistake throws the whole 
<br>
thing out. Okay, so we invoke redundancy. But now new hazards arise, not 
<br>
least the necessity to find not just one but two or even 56 or 132 ace 
<br>
remote viewers.
<br>
<p>I've bored you all, I can tell. Killfile the gullible idiot. Such 
<br>
incredible horseshit. Don't look, don't look.
