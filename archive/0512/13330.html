</em><br>
<p>I was comparing my knowledge to yours, Jeff.  I have read a couple of 
<br>
hundred papers on parapsychology, presented papers myself, had one 
<br>
publication and done several experiments.  I organized two international 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;conferences on parapsychology, in 1983 and 84 and have appeared on 
<br>
television and radio a couple of times, as an expert/experimenter.  I 
<br>
also have a qualification in mainstream psychology, and have published 
<br>
in that field.
<br>
<p>As both I and Damien have now pointed out, Sue's publication list is 
<br>
long, thin and mostly irrelevant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It's also ignorant of the completely acceptable division of epistemic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor that humans practice. If physicists say John Doe's Unified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theory is junk, you're not a scientist-wannabe (or any other slur) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismissing John Doe's claims without being a physicist.
</em><br>
<p>It is, as you say, perfectly valid for someone who does not know a field 
<br>
to cite someone inside that field, when it comes to choosing between 
<br>
competing points of view in that field.
<br>
<p>But you did not DO that.  You attempted to dismiss an ENTIRE field by 
<br>
citing one person in that field.  It is amateurish to try to do such a 
<br>
thing, while at the same time not having any knowledge of the actual 
<br>
empirical work in that field, nor of Sue Blackmore's actual work, or her 
<br>
very mediocre standing in it.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; To assert that phenomena so remarkable and world-changing as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paranormal would remain supressed because of some Grand Conspiracy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigotry by The Scientists is so laughable and sad it hurts. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see how implausible this is, I'm afraid you've just written off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your cognitive credibility completely.
</em><br>
<p>I said nothing whatsoever about a Grand Conspiracy, nor anything 
<br>
remotely like it.
<br>
<p>You put false words into my mouth and then denounce me for uttering them.
<br>
<p>I do believe this was the kind of bigotry I was referring to. ;-)
<br>
<p>End of discussion, thankfully.
<br>
