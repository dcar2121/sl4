<p>
David,
<br>
I realize that my views probably differ from most of the people on this list
<br>
but, of course, its always good to hear a different perspective so long as
<br>
it is rational and cogent. My background and interests are primarily in
<br>
philosophy but I am also a student of cognitive science though I am quite
<br>
new to AI theory.
<br>
If materialistic reductionism is the correct model of reality (which is very
<br>
problematic) then the concept of emergence must mean that the system in
<br>
question is merely not fully understood. This conclusion, however, is
<br>
questionable.
<br>
Whether or not qualia is a contingent phenomenon is precisely what is in
<br>
question so to dismiss the question based on what some think is to beg the
<br>
question
<br>
Point taken on evolution.
<br>
As to the argument that humans have consciousness therefor all GI must have
<br>
consciousness is equivalent to humans are based on DNA therefor all GI must
<br>
be based on DNA. This comparison is specious. I am starting from the
<br>
presupposition of functionalism. From this functionalism perspective one
<br>
would say that humans are based on an encoded set of instructions (the form
<br>
of those instructions is irrelevant) and I would say that if AGI is to be
<br>
built it will be based on an engineered set of instructions. So based on
<br>
this reasoning I am merely arguing that consciousness COULD have a
<br>
functional utility that would imply that any sufficiently intelligent system
<br>
might be consciousness. This possibility may turn out to be false but there
<br>
is no fallacy contained in the hypothesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you're onto.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: &quot;micah glasser&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:micahglasser@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Please%20Re-read%20CAFAI">micahglasser@gmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't really say I disagree with much you've said here. I guess my point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was just that consciousness could turn out to be a necessary emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of any sufficiently intelligent system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Be very sceptical of &quot;necessary emergent properties&quot;, they often are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the system under study is poorly understood. Emergence is all too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fancy word to signify &quot;I don't know how the system is behaving and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something weird is going on&quot;. In terms of substance, let us leave it at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, I don't think there's any substantive evidence for the thesis that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence without the kind of sense of self we humans have is possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, self-awareness is in many ways an illusion, much of it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trickery to give unity to our experience and such.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You also said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To answer your question all that I mean by consciousness is the phenomenal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of qualia, and by self conscious the phenomenal awareness of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self. (I think Hume refutes himself on this point). Descartes's cogito is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really the only place from which to begin a rational discussion in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion but this is off topic. The next issue I wish to address is your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The existence, in a metaphysical sense, of qualia, is a hotly debated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd dare say the majority of the people on this list believe that qualia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a contingent manifestation of experience in some intelligent systems, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely reducible to informatics or physics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stipulation that evolution is an intelligent process. Evolution does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to a goal system which means that it is neither intelligent nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious. Of course if one believes in some sort of theism then one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that evolution was exactly an intelligent process. I remain agnostic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this point because I don't believe the possibility can be ruled out. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate nature has only produced one entity that we know of with General
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence and that is man. Man is a conscious and self-aware being. So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not to much of a stretch to suppose that consciousness and intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are related.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution is not intelligent[1], it is an optimization process. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization process can look a lot like intelligence, though. In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dawkins said something to the effect that biology is the study of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural machines that appear to have been designed, or something to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect. The point is that human intelligence is not the only possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization process, and an optimization process can behave like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent, can maximizeexpected utility. There's no reason to believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization processes are in any manner self aware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to the &quot;we're the only intelligent things around and we're aware so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably intelligence implies awareness&quot;, one could equally say &quot;we're the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only intelligent things around and we're DNA-based so intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA&quot;. It is an insufficiently substantiated idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1: I'd argue that evolution doesn't sufficiently maximize expected utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be considered intelligent.
</em><br>
