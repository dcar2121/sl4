<p>Oh, don't be deceived by all the garbage that gets associated with 
<br>
paranormal research in the tabloid media and in the mouths of the 
<br>
abusive skeptics:  for most of the &quot;serious&quot; scientists involved, there 
<br>
is no question of this being about magic or demon-haunted worlds.  It's 
<br>
just (as some people, who like to be careful call it) &quot;anomalous 
<br>
information transfer&quot;.
<br>
<p>Well, okay, sometimes anomalous physical phenomena (PK, or poltergeist 
<br>
phenomena).  But even the people I know who have experienced the 
<br>
physical phenomena do not put it down to ghosts or spirits or demons, 
<br>
they just reckon it to be unusual events caused by thought processes.
<br>
<p>And for what it's worth, I actually think that consciousness and thought 
<br>
processes can appear in a brain or in a machine substrate WITHOUT the 
<br>
need for paranormal effects.  I mean, that's why I am on this list, 
<br>
after all.
<br>
<p>My personal belief is that the psi stuff will emerge as an interesting 
<br>
side effect of the creation of minds.
