From: Ben Goertzel
<br>
<em>&gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snipped my suggestion about SETI@HOme&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This sort of arrangement would not suit my Novamente AI architecture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because Novamente requires a lot of processing power, all of which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very rapid access to a lot of RAM.  It's much better suited to a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Linux cluster than a SETI @ Home type arrangement, at least for core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive processign.  However, a widely distributed network a la SETI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; @ Home could potentially be used for some particular kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente processing, as an additional portion of the underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware architecture.
</em><br>
<p>Not, surprising that it requires close clustering.
<br>
<p>Perhaps some University student lab or other pools of computers
<br>
can be borrowed on occasion for testing.
<br>
<p>Presumably once you have it up, it could sleep during the 
<br>
hours when the computers are otherwise occupied.
<br>
<p>But, the 500 x $1000 (or a few thousand) for hardware
<br>
doesn't seem that tough compared to your other expenses
<br>
(when you are ready).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I estimate that with a 3-5 year development effort by a team of 5-8
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expert AI programmer/scientists (like my current Novamente development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; team), we could have a human-level &quot;artificial child&quot;, running on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ~200-500 PC cluster.  Another 5-10 years could viably yield an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adult-level &quot;artificial scientist&quot; potentially able to launch a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>Does the above presume (any of) the following:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) The approximate 1000 fold increase in computing power
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(at any particular price point) that 15 years may
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Appreciably more RAM per PC than is common today?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 to a few GB are now common) or perhaps 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must faster (and larger) disk drives which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perform well enough to substitute for current
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RAM?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) A large number of &quot;breakthoughs&quot; in AI technique?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Any significantly &quot;hard&quot; breakthroughs?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Adult-level &quot;scientist&quot; AI is also a &quot;programmer&quot;?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e., able to program and learn how to program
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better.)
<br>
<p>While I see some required breakthroughs (e.g., &quot;programmmer AI&quot;
<br>
is very rudimentary today compared to NLP), it seems these
<br>
breakthroughs will actually ADD to the processing needs and
<br>
modules such as the NLP or perhaps neural nets and EA methods
<br>
which are fairly well understand will benefit mostly from
<br>
much more RAM and processing power, along with increased 
<br>
'common knowledge' stored and processed there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, though, my development team and I are currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending the bulk of our time on commercial narrow-AI consulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects that pay the bills, so this &quot;3-5 year development effort&quot; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically only start if/when we achieve a reasonable amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding.  Which is not an easy thing to do for a project of this sort.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;sigh&gt;  Sympathies extended.
<br>
<p>This is one of the reasons for my own activities being
<br>
VERY limited.
