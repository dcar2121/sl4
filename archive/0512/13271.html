<em>&gt;===== Original Message From Phillip Huggan &lt;<a href="mailto:cdnprodigy@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20KARDASHEV%20SCALE">cdnprodigy@yahoo.com</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yep, either there aren't any or they are evil.  I really doubt advanced 
</em><br>
civilizations are plentiful enough to admit the latter scenario.  But if there 
<br>
are Powers out there, I'm curiouis what other purpose they would construct for 
<br>
their lives other than doing good deeds.  What do you mean by respect for 
<br>
heterogeneaity?  Do you mean a way to assuage boredom?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm conceptualizing a multiversal core which is essentially chaotic, 
<br>
producing universes according to an evolutionary model, that is blind but 
<br>
theoretically unlimited optimization, versus intelligently designed universes 
<br>
which could self-regulate and minimalize evil, but are finite in number by the 
<br>
definition of design. Granted, such a system would have to be designed itself, 
<br>
so its possible that we live in such a multiverse where &quot;evil&quot; is minimalized, 
<br>
even if the potential number of universes is unlimited. There are different 
<br>
kinds of infinities, an infinite number of universes does not imply an 
<br>
infinite number of heavens or hells. But say there are an infinite number of 
<br>
collapsed universes, an infinite number of universes incapable of complex 
<br>
chemistry, life, ect. A Type VII civilization responsible for the sea of being 
<br>
isn't nessecarily going to take responsibility for colonizing and re-designing 
<br>
every dead universe, or for intervening with civilizations like ours, the same 
<br>
goes for a Type VI society of Powers capable of multiversal travel. This goes 
<br>
for an infinite multiverse, in a finite multiverse the ethics would be 
<br>
different, but I don't think its that simple.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By analogy, I'm not concerned with curbing the AIDS epidemic or ending 
<br>
world hunger, I'm concerned with promoting a friendly singularity, because the 
<br>
latter encompasses the former. Likewise, a Type VII civ wouldn't be concerned 
<br>
with helping a single universe when there are potentially infinite universes 
<br>
just like ours, it would be a futile effort. Instead, such a civilization's 
<br>
concerns would be better suited with the overall integrity of the system, 
<br>
which being evolutionary, is heterogeneous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've already suggested a way this can be enacted without succombing to evil.
</em><br>
&nbsp;The default flow of causality is a &gt;meaningless concept if you can control 
<br>
causality.  What else does that leave?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theres a Christian saying (its Christmas eve after all) &quot;the lord works in 
<br>
mysterious ways.&quot; Its really a very infuriating proverb, since its often used 
<br>
to salve all sorts of seemingly arbitrary horrors, but I think it applies 
<br>
here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our philosophy is actually quite advanced.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? We may have thorough epistemological frameworks appropriate for our 
<br>
brains in our physical situations, but a philosophy appropriate for the brains 
<br>
of a Power or beyond in the context of an infinite multiversal system would be 
<br>
a horse of an altogether different color, don't you think?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It isn't fair to shortchange humans by suggesting there is some ethics we 
</em><br>
couldn't possibly understand.  This &gt;is hypothesizing epistimological 
<br>
self-actualization, not brain surgery.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True, many a war and atrocity has been justified by that suggestion, and 
<br>
I'm basically jusifying all the suffering of the whole history of the universe 
<br>
by that suggestion. Brain surgery might not mean self-actualization, which is 
<br>
basically a looped notion anyway, but changes to the brain, say the 
<br>
nuerochemical shifts brought on by psychedelic drug use, can affect one's 
<br>
worldview in interesting ways, so the same probably applies to more radical 
<br>
forms of brain adjustment. I'd suggest that if there are Powers out there, 
<br>
they're certianly beyond &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot;, and if they were of a moral 
<br>
persuasion easily identifiable by humans, then the universe would be very 
<br>
different and probably a lot less interesting.
<br>
