</em><br>
<p>I agree that Wilson's paragraph is not a sufficient explanation.
<br>
<p>Consider the concept of an optimization process: a system which hits 
<br>
small targets in large search spaces to produce coherent real-world effects.
<br>
<p>An optimization process steers the future into particular regions of the 
<br>
possible.  I am visiting a distant city, and a local friend volunteers 
<br>
to drive me to the airport.  I do not know the neighborhood.  When my 
<br>
friend comes to a street intersection, I am at a loss to predict my 
<br>
friend's turns, either individually or in sequence.  Yet I can predict 
<br>
the result of my friend's unpredictable actions: we will arrive at the 
<br>
airport.  Even if my friend's house were located elsewhere in the city, 
<br>
so that my friend made a wholly different sequence of turns, I would 
<br>
just as confidently predict our destination.  Is this not a strange 
<br>
situation to be in, scientifically speaking?  I can predict the outcome 
<br>
of a process, without being able to predict any of the intermediate 
<br>
steps in the process.  I will speak of the region into which an 
<br>
optimization process steers the future as that optimizer's target.
<br>
<p>Consider a car, say a Toyota Corolla.  Of all possible configurations 
<br>
for the atoms making up the Corolla, only an infinitesimal fraction 
<br>
qualify as a useful working car.  If you assembled molecules at random, 
<br>
many many ages of the universe would pass before you hit on a car.  A 
<br>
tiny fraction of the design space does describe vehicles that we would 
<br>
recognize as faster, more efficient, and safer than the Corolla.  Thus 
<br>
the Corolla is not optimal under the designer's goals.  The Corolla is, 
<br>
however, optimized, because the designer had to hit a comparatively 
<br>
infinitesimal target in design space just to create a working car, let 
<br>
alone a car of the Corolla's quality.  You cannot build so much as an 
<br>
effective wagon by sawing boards randomly and nailing according to 
<br>
coinflips.  To hit such a tiny target in configuration space requires a 
<br>
powerful optimization process.
<br>
<p>The notion of an &quot;optimization process&quot; is predictively useful because 
<br>
it can be easier to understand the target of an optimization process 
<br>
than to understand its step-by-step dynamics.  The above discussion of 
<br>
the Corolla assumes implicitly that the designer of the Corolla was 
<br>
trying to produce a &quot;vehicle&quot;, a means of travel.  This assumption 
<br>
deserves to be made explicit, but it is not wrong.
<br>
<p>If I play chess against a stronger player, I cannot predict exactly 
<br>
where my opponent will move against me - if I could predict that, I 
<br>
would necessarily be at least that strong at chess myself.  But I can 
<br>
predict the end result, which is a win for the other player.  When I am 
<br>
at my most creative, that is when it is hardest to predict my actions, 
<br>
and easiest to predict the consequences of my actions - if you know and 
<br>
understand my goals.
<br>
<p>This strange balance sometimes confuses people, so that they conflate 
<br>
creativity with randomness and begin to praise entropy.  Sometimes the 
<br>
chess master makes a move which surprises me completely - and if so, I'm 
<br>
probably about to get wiped off the board.  On one level, I was very 
<br>
much surprised by the action; on a higher level, the outcome became that 
<br>
much more predictable.  There is no creative surprise without some 
<br>
criterion that makes it surprisingly good.  One can easily reduce my 
<br>
ability to predict an opponent's moves by substituting a random move 
<br>
generator; but a random opponent will play poor chess.  Randomness is 
<br>
not at all the same as creativity.
<br>
<p>Suppose you want an exceptionally good answer, better than you yourself 
<br>
could invent.  Then it may make sense to delegate the question to a 
<br>
physical process located outside your brain, configured by you to search 
<br>
for a solution.  If so, you sacrifice your ability to predict the exact 
<br>
solution in advance of searching - if you could exactly predict the 
<br>
answer, there would be no point in delegating the search.  This applies 
<br>
on any level where, by your lights, there are better answers and worse 
<br>
ones.  But you need not sacrifice your ability to say what is the 
<br>
question.  It may be an extremely high-level question, but if you don't 
<br>
have something in mind, you might as well program the search process to 
<br>
return a random answer.  Maximum entropy is not the same as maximum 
<br>
creativity.
