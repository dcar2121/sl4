Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These organizations frequently buy up such experts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such research decades in advance.
</em><br>
<p>Not really -- they generally buy up the experts after the big advances
<br>
have already happened.  I agree that there are rare exceptions, but AI
<br>
is not one.  You would see it if this was happening -- smart AI PhD's
<br>
from top schools would be &quot;disappearing&quot; into these companies or
<br>
organizations, which is not happening at all.  Rather, AI is a weak
<br>
job market in these organizations and out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Since academic/corporate AI these days is so strongly opposed to AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; research, my guess is that *if* there is an AGI breakthrough in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; next 10-15 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting:  I didn't know that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you offer some references or documentation for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion (I ask not in order to stifle debate, as some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shout &quot;cite&quot; whenever they disagree but rather because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am truly interested and curious about this phenomenon.)
</em><br>
<p>Well, you could look at Minsky's chapter in this book
<br>
<p><a href="http://llt.msu.edu/vol1num1/reviews/hal.html">http://llt.msu.edu/vol1num1/reviews/hal.html</a>
<br>
<p>or (when it finally comes out in a few months) my forthcoming edited
<br>
volume on AGI,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.springer.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,,4-147-22-43950079-0,00.html">http://www.springer.com/sgw/cda/frontpage/0,,4-147-22-43950079-0,00.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, be warned that one possibility for this is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'someone' (like the NSA) is actively discouraging such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work and at the same time is offering strong incentives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for those who can and do pursue it to be &quot;one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family&quot; and keep such research under security veil.
</em><br>
<p>I know enough about both the AI field and the intel community to know
<br>
that this is very unlikely to be true; but I realize there is no way
<br>
to convince you that it isn't true, if you choose to maintain this
<br>
belief.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Al Qaeda?  Or some rogue nation?
</em><br>
<p>No chance -- those countries have very little technological advancement
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is unlikely that a &quot;maverick breakthrough&quot; will have much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect until hardware increases by several orders of magnitude.
</em><br>
<p>And what evidence do you have for THIS assertion?  As someone actively
<br>
involved with AGI design, I am not nearly so sure as you are of
<br>
this....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, those with the hardware will have the first chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually try any such breakthroughs....
</em><br>
<p>You're making an unjustified assumption about the hardware
<br>
requirements of a successful AGI design.
<br>
<p>Based on my current estimates (which are based on the capabilities of
<br>
my own Novamente AI system when run on a handful of machines), the
<br>
minimum hardware requirements for an AGI are not *less* than a few
<br>
hundred commodity PC's ... but I am not sure they are more than this. 
<br>
And a few hundred PC's are not all that expensive to network together.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
