<p>
Would it make more sense to replace CEV with the concept of goodness? It
<br>
seems to me that implementing an invariant of goodness for an initial
<br>
dynamic should encompass all of the goals of Friendliness while such an
<br>
initial dynamic system should be more tractable than building it with CEV
<br>
(emphasis on the uncertainty of &quot;seems&quot; and &quot;should&quot;).
<br>
<p>Keeping in the spirit of Yudkowsky's design of FAI, the good AI would
<br>
perform, at each step, preferably provable actions that would always be good
<br>
according to an ever-evolving moral judgment subsystem while the supergoal
<br>
of this good AI would be to improve that judgment system for better
<br>
approximation of the concept of goodness.
<br>
<p>The most important question is, of course, whether good AI would do as
<br>
&quot;good&quot; of a job as perfectly working Friendly AI. My initial opinion on
<br>
this is that it should since Friendliness is an aspect of doing good,
<br>
meaning that all of good AI's actions would necessarily be Friendly. I
<br>
imagine that such an AI would eventually implement an optimal version of
<br>
what we mean by Friendliness (a good thing) as a consequence of doing good.
<br>
<p>Initial dynamic of such an AI would obviously have to be jump-started by
<br>
human moral judgment system with human concept of goodness which would
<br>
ultimately transcend beyond human value system and include everyone and
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>One of the main practical benefits of this version of AI over CEV that might
<br>
be possible is that it could perhaps further shift the burden of
<br>
implementing moral framework from humans to an AI, thus decreasing the
<br>
amount and complexity of necessary human work. Obviously, this assumes that
<br>
&quot;goodness&quot; is easier (and sufficient) to implement than Friendliness which
<br>
might not be true in practice.
<br>
<p>S.P.
