<p>
Micah,
<br>
First, I don't like saying this, because maybe you simply have a very
<br>
different and equally valid model of things, but I think you lack some of
<br>
the knowledge is often taken for granted on this list. You seem to have a
<br>
basically philosophical formation, without much atendance to information
<br>
theory and cognitive processes. Otherwise maybe I'm simply not getting what
<br>
you're onto.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;micah glasser&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:micahglasser@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Please%20Re-read%20CAFAI">micahglasser@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
I can't really say I disagree with much you've said here. I guess my point
<br>
was just that consciousness could turn out to be a necessary emergent
<br>
property of any sufficiently intelligent system.
<br>
<p>Be very sceptical of &quot;necessary emergent properties&quot;, they often are a sign
<br>
that the system under study is poorly understood. Emergence is all too often
<br>
a fancy word to signify &quot;I don't know how the system is behaving and
<br>
something weird is going on&quot;. In terms of substance, let us leave it at
<br>
that, I don't think there's any substantive evidence for the thesis that no
<br>
intelligence without the kind of sense of self we humans have is possible.
<br>
That said, self-awareness is in many ways an illusion, much of it is
<br>
trickery to give unity to our experience and such.
<br>
<p>You also said:
<br>
To answer your question all that I mean by consciousness is the phenomenal
<br>
awareness of qualia, and by self conscious the phenomenal awareness of a
<br>
self. (I think Hume refutes himself on this point). Descartes's cogito is
<br>
really the only place from which to begin a rational discussion in my
<br>
opinion but this is off topic. The next issue I wish to address is your
<br>
<p>The existence, in a metaphysical sense, of qualia, is a hotly debated issue.
<br>
I'd dare say the majority of the people on this list believe that qualia are
<br>
a contingent manifestation of experience in some intelligent systems, and
<br>
entirely reducible to informatics or physics.
<br>
<p>And:
<br>
stipulation that evolution is an intelligent process. Evolution does not act
<br>
according to a goal system which means that it is neither intelligent nor
<br>
conscious. Of course if one believes in some sort of theism then one would
<br>
say that evolution was exactly an intelligent process. I remain agnostic on
<br>
this point because I don't believe the possibility can be ruled out. At any
<br>
rate nature has only produced one entity that we know of with General
<br>
Intelligence and that is man. Man is a conscious and self-aware being. So it
<br>
is not to much of a stretch to suppose that consciousness and intelligence
<br>
are related.
<br>
<p>Evolution is not intelligent[1], it is an optimization process. An
<br>
optimization process can look a lot like intelligence, though. In fact,
<br>
Dawkins said something to the effect that biology is the study of those
<br>
natural machines that appear to have been designed, or something to that
<br>
effect. The point is that human intelligence is not the only possible
<br>
optimization process, and an optimization process can behave like a rational
<br>
agent, can maximizeexpected utility. There's no reason to believe that
<br>
optimization processes are in any manner self aware.
<br>
As to the &quot;we're the only intelligent things around and we're aware so
<br>
probably intelligence implies awareness&quot;, one could equally say &quot;we're the
<br>
only intelligent things around and we're DNA-based so intelligence requires
<br>
DNA&quot;. It is an insufficiently substantiated idea.
<br>
<p>1: I'd argue that evolution doesn't sufficiently maximize expected utility
<br>
to be considered intelligent.
<br>
