</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is very close to my own view.
</em><br>
<p>I had (what seemed to me) an interesting thought a few days ago which
<br>
may be relevant.  Someone asked whether the end justifies the means,
<br>
and in the course of responding with what I see as the bigger-picture
<br>
answer to that question, I stated something like &quot;wisdom is being able
<br>
to assess the consequences of one's actions in the largest possible
<br>
context, while acting within the smallest effective context.&quot;  The
<br>
point being that the most effective action is that which accomplishes
<br>
the intended goal while minimizing the probability of unintended
<br>
consequences, but it takes a big picture view to assess.
<br>
<p>A while later I was thinking that this might imply something about the
<br>
Fermi Paradox, which I already suspected is a matter of going inward. 
<br>
It seems to me that with increasing intelligence (leading to
<br>
increasing wisdom) advanced civilizations would naturally tend to
<br>
minimize all extraneous effects thus supporting the idea of going
<br>
inward.
<br>
<p>We've already become quite aware in the years since Kardashev, the
<br>
Drake equation, and the start of the SETI project, that the most
<br>
effectively encoded information is indistinguishable from random
<br>
noise.  We're also seeing all around us that accelerating technology
<br>
increasingly lets us do more with less, and that the older obvious
<br>
assumption that growth necessarily corresponds with increasing energy
<br>
consumption (and therefore size) may not be universally true.  Indeed,
<br>
when we think about optimal design, there is a lot to be said for
<br>
diversity in type as well as location, so we might expect benefits
<br>
from a system with the appearance of fine dust rather than awesome
<br>
matrioshka brains or other concentrated configurations of
<br>
computronium.   Robert Bradbury,  who did quite a lot of rigorous
<br>
thinking on this subject, especially matrioshka brains, published a
<br>
paper earlier this year where he suggested that he now think it more
<br>
likely that advanced civilizations would live near the outer edge of
<br>
the galaxy rather than in the more energy-dense central regions. (I
<br>
may have this wrong, since I  haven't carefully read his paper.)
<br>
<p>Another aspect to consider is whether the values of an advanced
<br>
civilization should be expected to reflect the kind of outward growth
<br>
that we may think is normal based on our current values.  This takes
<br>
us back to my initial statement about acting within the smallest
<br>
effective context, which seems to me very much a value statement
<br>
(saying what is generally good) based on what is seen to work.
