<em>&gt; Any happy human conscious entity. I don't see why either the capacity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for happiness or the desire for one's continued existence is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary feature of consciousness in general.
</em><br>
<p>It's refreshing to see when others recognize &quot;happiness&quot; and the
<br>
desire for one's continued existence as specific characteristics of
<br>
evolved organisms but not required for intelligent systems in general.
<br>
&nbsp;I enclose the word &quot;happiness&quot; in scare quotes because many people
<br>
seem not to have a coherent conceptualization of the term, and worse,
<br>
think of it in terms of some absolute scale, rather than as an
<br>
indication of the current satisfaction of the goal system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if ve tiled me to be &quot;better&quot;, my &quot;better&quot; self would surely not desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; return to my previous identity.  It is an arbitrary distinction valuing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; permanence of my less than optimally happy existence over my tiled happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state of affairs to be.  But it is prec! isely this distinction that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; separates &quot;friendly&quot; AGI from orgasmium or whatever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the difficulty here is, at the root, the problem of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjectivity of morality. We think it would be wrong for an AI to kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone and put a different person in their place, even if the new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person was very similar. Why is it wrong, though? We know that we want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI that won't put an end to us, that won't break out continuity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity. But humans don't have any real, core identity that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either be broken or not broken. That's more or less a convenient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusion.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, again refreshingly broad thinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectively, humans have these moral intuitions, and they drive us,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychologically, in certain directions. That's morality, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence. Without humans, and all of their idiosyncracies, there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be no morality. In the end, the only way to define the morality of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various actions is to introduce arbitrary distinctions, between human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and non-human, or sentient and non-sentient, or living and non-living.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Between &quot;same&quot; and &quot;different&quot;. Between &quot;icky&quot; and &quot;not-icky&quot;. Binary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classifications that are ultimately based on some object's measurement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a continuous physical scale.
</em><br>
<p>Here's where I would offer some additional depth to the stated concept
<br>
of morality.  Humans do indeed have an instinctive, or as you say
<br>
intuitive,  faculty of morality below the level of conscious
<br>
awareness, and demonstrably below the level of rationality. But it's
<br>
not really arbitrary since it is the result of  a long evolutionary
<br>
process selecting for what worked in the environment of evolutionary
<br>
adaptation, and there's a great degree of commonality of moral values
<br>
across the human species, and even extended to other species for the
<br>
same reason--that what worked had a tendency to survive and grow.
<br>
<p>At a higher level of organization, moral values (those values which
<br>
work and thus survive and propagate) have been encoded into cultural
<br>
frameworks, most evident in the teachings and rules of the world's
<br>
religions.
<br>
<p>The critical problem, which many are now beginning to see, is that the
<br>
environment has changed, rapidly diverging from the environment of
<br>
evolutionary adaptation, and thus the values and decision-making
<br>
framework of the past are increasingly unsuited to current challenges
<br>
and thus may appear increasingly arbitrary.
<br>
<p>In a limited sense, morality is about following that deep instinctive
<br>
sense of what feels &quot;right&quot; and what feels &quot;wrong&quot; in light of shared
<br>
values.  (Morality is meaningless in the context of an isolated
<br>
individual.)
<br>
<p>In a broader sense, morality is about observing community standards
<br>
and codes of behavior, which may supervene the earlier morality based
<br>
on feelings, but tend to promote shared values more effectively.
<br>
<p>In an even broader sense, little appreciated currently, morality is
<br>
about decision-making that promotes increasingly shared values over
<br>
increasing scope of interaction with increasing effectiveness.
<br>
<p>My key point here is that morality is not arbitrary, or relative (in
<br>
the strong sense) and that notwithstanding the Naturalistic Fallacy,
<br>
there is an arrow of morality in terms of the ratcheting forward of
<br>
objective knowledge in the service of subjective values, increasingly
<br>
shared because they work [and fueled by increasing diversity at a
<br>
lower level.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Might not make right, but might--reality optimization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability--determines the future of the universe. And when humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone, the universe returns to neutral amorality.
</em><br>
<p>Back to your earliest statement, &quot;desire for one's continued
<br>
existence&quot; is ultimately a false hope, but promotion of one's values
<br>
into the future is the inescapable essence of morality.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think there's any way to escape the fact that, whatever kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of AI we choose to try to make, the decision is a moral one, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore an arbitrary one.
</em><br>
<p>Moral yes, arbitrary no, as explained (I hope) above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if humans were to evolve for another twenty thousand years without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking over their own biological processes, they'd might just evolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away this deeply uneasy and demotivating feeling I'm having right now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how arbitrary morality is. They'd probably be perfectly fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it. As it is, I have no idea what the significance of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling is, or should be.
</em><br>
<p>To let go of the fragments of truth that no longer fit within the
<br>
older paradigm, to travel into the void with none of the previously
<br>
imagined means of support, and to come out the other side seeing that
<br>
all the pieces must and do fit in the bigger picture.
<br>
<p>Paradox is always a case of insufficient context.
<br>
