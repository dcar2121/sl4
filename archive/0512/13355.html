</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I very roughly sketched in how one could do so, at enormous cost 
<br>
in manpower.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the effect is real, and above chance, then you can construct error
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>One would hope so. Bearing in mind that we know how to train swimmers and 
<br>
runners to perform very well, but still they sometimes fail to win gold 
<br>
medals, even after they've just won three earlier in the day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And you can use an error correcting system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to output data of any level of implausiblity, given enough time(or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough parallel guessers).
</em><br>
<p>But this is exactly the practical consideration to which I drew attention. 
<br>
Millions or hundred of millions of bits, all generated (ideally) in the 
<br>
last couple of days before the draw. Pity we need humans in the loop. A psi 
<br>
machine would be handy. Maybe an AI will do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The real question is, if you have the remote viewer working on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;same problem, does he output the same answer? Because if he doesn't,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can just iterate him over the same question, and pick the output
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that rises out of the noise floor.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course. (With certain provisos, both theoretical and empirical, 
<br>
arising from the very breaches in temporal order and locality required for 
<br>
the effect to exist; that is, the possibility of a kind of contagion is 
<br>
always there to fuck things up. I don't like that either, but it's not a 
<br>
get out of jail free card, it's a logical consequence of the postulated effect)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I've bored you all, I can tell. Killfile the gullible idiot. Such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incredible horseshit. Don't look, don't look.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Damien, this is very tiresome.
</em><br>
<p>Tell me about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Do you really believe that people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opinions about this sort of thing are controlled by some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aversive skeptical reflex?
</em><br>
<p>Largely, yes. That, and the appalling cultural pollution by crackpots and 
<br>
halfwits and scoundrels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How many people have gone looking for psi?
</em><br>
<p>Not very many, actually, if we're talking trained scientists. Funding has 
<br>
always been low, compared with most sciences, even when the brief period of 
<br>
(known) military funding is added in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No one has devised a replicateable experiment, however
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simple, which has sufficiently challenged mainstream scientists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respond.
</em><br>
<p>Largely, I think, because the effects are stochastic and weak. When more 
<br>
startling and apparently replicable effects are found, such as presentiment 
<br>
presponse spikes, mainstream folks tend to turn away with a shudder of 
<br>
disbelief. No disproof needed; it can't be so, so it isn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The question is whether this implies something about all scientists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or about all psi effects in experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Both, I think, if we read &quot;most&quot; for &quot;all&quot; and add &quot;at the moment&quot;.
<br>
