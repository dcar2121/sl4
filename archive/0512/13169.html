I don't think it hard to show that, in general, better knowledge (knowledge
<br>
that more accurately describes reality) improves chances of achieving one's
<br>
goals. Such knowledge includes facts about 'the world', knowledge about how
<br>
to achieve goals, and even knowledge about what facts to ignore in making a
<br>
decision.

<br>
<p>Thanks Peter.  That's my point for step one of this line of thought,
<br>
which seems to be alien enough that it's amazingly difficult to
<br>
achieve general understanding.
<br>
<p>Step two is something like the following:
<br>
<p>(1)  Can we agree that increasing knowledge (of the
<br>
objective/scientific/instrumental kind) tends to increase the
<br>
capability of any agent to achieve its (subjective) goals, therefore
<br>
increasing objective knowledge of how things work is necessarilly good
<br>
(from the point of view of any subjective agent?)
<br>
<p>This is similar to the popular question &quot;Is scientific progress
<br>
inherently good?&quot;, but the significant difference here is I am
<br>
carefully specifying the question (for the moment) in terms of
<br>
individual, subjective good, since, as we agreed earlier, &quot;good&quot; in
<br>
itself is meaningless.
