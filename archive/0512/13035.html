Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Based on your past statements I'm pretty sure you're well aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all that Ben and would acknowledge your statement as hopeful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimisim; e.g. 'given the above, I feel we would have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nontrivial chance of success...', which is fine. I'm just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reminding everyone else, if they haven't already concluded as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much from the sheer number of people who've said something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'given enough funding to make my project feel serious and well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipped, we can probably build an AGI in X years' and failed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miserably, not to take these kind of claims as serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions. It is unfortuante that the funding environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly rewards those who claim 'Yes, I can definitely build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AGI in X years given Y million dollars' and sound convincing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it; it encourages both scams and honest self-delusion. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am glad that so far I have been able to raise funding without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having to make such claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<p>Michael, yes, I basically agree with these sentiments you have expressed.
<br>
<p>This conversation reminded me of a recent negotiation with some
<br>
potential investors in Novamente, which did not end up successfully.
<br>
<p>I suspect that if the Novamente team and I had taken more of an
<br>
evangelical, absolutely-certain stance, then we might well have gotten
<br>
the funding from these individuals.
<br>
<p>But we presented ourselves honestly, as a group of individuals with
<br>
different estimates of the time it would take to complete our project
<br>
and of our ultimate odds of success.  All of us on the team think the
<br>
project has a nontrivial probability of achieving human-level AGI
<br>
within &lt; 15 years, but each of us has our own specific probability
<br>
estimates of the amount that can be achieved within each particular
<br>
period of time, and we all realize that our estimates are highly
<br>
uncertain.  (FYI, I have the highest estimate of the odds of eventual
<br>
success of everyone on the team, but perhaps not the briefest estimate
<br>
of the expected time to success in the case that success is achieved. 
<br>
So I am not the biggest optimist according to every measure.)
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, it seemed that presenting our opinions and attitudes
<br>
honestly in this way turned off the investors, who it appeared would
<br>
have been happier to hear everyone on the team say: &quot;We are all
<br>
absolutely certain that we will create a human-level AGI within 7
<br>
years using X amount of money and Y amount of computing resources.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am happy you have been able to find funding for your work while
<br>
presenting your case honestly.  I will keep presenting my case
<br>
honestly as well and hope that this will eventually lead to finding an
<br>
adequate amount of funding for the Novamente project.  Otherwise,
<br>
perhaps someone else with superior salesmanship skills and a
<br>
different, also workable, AGI design will succeed in raising funding
<br>
for their AGI system first and beat me to the end goal.  (If so, I
<br>
sure hope they're both benevolent and careful... ;-p)
<br>
