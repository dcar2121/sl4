<em>&gt;  If materialistic reductionism is the correct model of reality (which is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think the main, and common, complaint against emergence around here
<br>
is that it's a word that doesn't explain anything. It can be accurate,
<br>
but is usually largely vacuuous.
<br>
<p>So what's questionable about the conclusion? What conclusion?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From this functionalism perspective one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would say that humans are based on an encoded set of instructions (the form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those instructions is irrelevant) and I would say that if AGI is to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built it will be based on an engineered set of instructions. So based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this reasoning I am merely arguing that consciousness COULD have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional utility that would imply that any sufficiently intelligent system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be consciousness. This possibility may turn out to be false but there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no fallacy contained in the hypothesis.
</em><br>
<p>My main complain with your argument is that you seem to be reading
<br>
more into &quot;consciousness&quot;, as in &quot;self awareness&quot;, than is warranted
<br>
by your hypotheticals. While the AI we can call Bob is probably
<br>
necessarily aware of Bob's existence if Bob has attained a certain
<br>
level of ability, Bob's internal modeling of Bob will probably bear
<br>
little resemblance to a human's consciousness or self awareness. You
<br>
have a lot more work to do if you want to draw any comparisons. Your
<br>
respondents are probably preemptively warning you away from this
<br>
tendency to anthropomorphize, which you've sort of treaded a little.
