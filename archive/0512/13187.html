<em>&gt; A follow-up thought:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea behind my suggestion is that we sloooooow the discussion down a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we force the pace to be more measured, the posts might rise above the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads&quot; problem.
</em><br>
<p>It's my opinion that the primary problem with the S/N ratio of mailing
<br>
lists is that people are able to just contribute something, all the
<br>
while ignoring the contributions of those in past discussions. Now,
<br>
this is a perfectly understandable behavior. I imagine almost no one
<br>
reads the complete SL4 archives before they contribute any posts to
<br>
the list. I really think the pace has little to do with this, and
<br>
furthermore that keeping up a brisk pace is necessary if one is to
<br>
keep people motivated to participate. If the feedback is too slow,
<br>
people will lose interest and your site will never reach a critical
<br>
mass.
<br>
<p>The idea you expressed in the other post addresses the S/N ratio
<br>
problem effectively, but I'm very wary of any sort of collaborative
<br>
moderation techniques in a site open to public participation. And I
<br>
think inviting public participation is important. (See Kuro5hin and
<br>
Slashdot for examples of collaborative moderation that really sucks.)
<br>
Moderation also tends to fail completely when the subjects being
<br>
discussed are particularly polemic.
<br>
<p>Also, the pace in your system isn't fast enough. People have to commit
<br>
too much time returning to check on their contribution. That's one
<br>
unnecessary barrier to participation.
<br>
<p>I think a better system is one in which contributions are very small
<br>
and atomic. I think the system I have in mind can be described as a
<br>
modification to the one you proposed. On any given essay, there are
<br>
behind the essay a network of &quot;statement&quot; nodes, one for each sentence
<br>
or two or three in the essay. Each node is interrelated to any number
<br>
of other nodes by any number of relationship types. A proposed change
<br>
or addition will then be much easier to evaluate, and controversy much
<br>
easier to manage. The two main problems in defining such a system are
<br>
deciding what types of nodes and relationships can adequately model
<br>
normal dialectic, and designing a user interface for such a network
<br>
that isn't completely unmanageable.
