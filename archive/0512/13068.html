</em><br>
<p>The main way in which public visibility can increase the probability
<br>
of FAI is to attract notice and funding for projects that can use the
<br>
funding to increase the probability of FAI. People who might not have
<br>
heard of it otherwise become potential doners. And unless we can
<br>
determine that only .01-.001 percent of people hearing about the
<br>
singularity this way would contribute to our causes, it might be worth
<br>
it. Even if .1 percent of people hearing about the singularity this
<br>
way ever donated, that could be a lot of money with exposure in the
<br>
millions or tens of millions.
<br>
<p>As far as making individual people more likely to contribute to FAI or
<br>
to contribute other tools that facilitate the work on FAI, public
<br>
visibility doesn't really gain us much, except perhaps a little less
<br>
resistence from technical people who might otherwise think the whole
<br>
FAI movement a bunch of bullshit. (Good) publicity does buy a little
<br>
legitimacy, even among the technically adept. Perhaps it shouldn't,
<br>
but it does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Visibility among technical people likely to contribute, though, is. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's an entirely different matter, and in fact popular mischaracterization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of transhuman/singularitarian ideas might be counterproductive, driving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people away.
</em><br>
<p>Given that, it's important not to be afraid of attitudes toward
<br>
transhumanism/singularitarianism being very polarized, as long as the
<br>
positive position is prominent enough.
