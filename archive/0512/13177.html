<p>I have also had exactly the same thought, and I was planning to set up 
<br>
some kind of mechanism to do this in the near future.  Since I am not 
<br>
quite ready to try it out, I will float the best ideas I have and 
<br>
(mindful of the negative feedback that this post *itself* will attract) 
<br>
hope that the suggestions themselves don't disappear into the usual 
<br>
argument-noise.
<br>
<p>What about a web site organized around &quot;evolving essays&quot;, of the 
<br>
following sort:
<br>
<p>1) Someone starts with an encyclopaedia-like, hierarchical topic list, 
<br>
which is supposed to be the set of categories within which essays (which 
<br>
will end up being encyclopaedia entries) are stored.
<br>
<p>2) This framework is debated, but the debate takes the form of 
<br>
restatements of the topic list, which are then voted on in some way.  So 
<br>
for example, if I think that a branch of the topic list headed by the 
<br>
topic &quot;AGI Goal Systems&quot; should be split into
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AGI Goal Systems
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decision-Theory-Based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivational-System-Based
<br>
<p>... then it is up to me to suggest this, and to provide two headline 
<br>
paragraphs (no more than one para for each subtopic) that describe the 
<br>
two subtopics.
<br>
<p>3) If an aelaboration of the topic tree is sanctioned, it first comes in 
<br>
as a &quot;provisional&quot; branch, and it is then up to someone to suggest an 
<br>
essay that describes the topic.
<br>
<p>4) People give feedback to the poster of the essay, and the feedback 
<br>
goes privately (no back and forth argument at this stage) to the poster. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is supposed to incorporate the suggestions into the essay 
<br>
if possible.
<br>
<p>5) When the essay writer has done editing the essay it is resubmitted to 
<br>
the list, and all, including the original reply folks, are invited to 
<br>
say whether this is coherent enough to stand.  (Coherent according to 
<br>
various criteria TBD).
<br>
<p>6) If someone strongly disagrees with the coherence of the essay, they 
<br>
must say so at this point, but there should be a fairly high threshold 
<br>
for rejection (you cannot simply disagree with it, you have to posit 
<br>
incoherence).
<br>
<p>7) Dissenting opinions are also allowed.  If an individual or a group 
<br>
believes that a particular entry is incomplete or wrong or bad in some 
<br>
way, it can write a coherent reply in the form of an essay, and send it 
<br>
through the same process.
<br>
<p><p>What I have in mind through this process is the collaborative writing of 
<br>
an extremely hierarchical book.
<br>
<p>Another note:  I think that we should make some allowance for background 
<br>
knowledge, but I am not sure how to do this.  For example, if someone 
<br>
well studied in philosophy makes comments about an issue that is, say, 
<br>
about hardware design, there ought to some way to give those comments 
<br>
less weight than if they come from a software or hardware engineer.  And 
<br>
vice-versa of course.  This is a little difficult, as it might imply 
<br>
people voluntarily submitting their claimed areas of expertise, which 
<br>
might not go over too well.
<br>
<p>Respectfully,
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore
