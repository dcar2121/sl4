Marc,
<br>
<p>This is the most rational thing you have posted in some time. I wish you 
<br>
would be so careful with all your posts.
<br>
<p>Does that mean you are a Platonic Idealist?
<br>
<p>I am convinced, through introspection, that Qualia &quot;is something&quot;, 
<br>
however, I am not an idealist. I use the existence of Qualia, which I am 
<br>
committed to by trusting my own observation. Clearly, Qualia is not 
<br>
reducible to physics /for me/ because I do not believe I could ever 
<br>
progress from a physical description of Qualia to an understanding of 
<br>
the sensation.
<br>
<p>Some time ago, I posted something describing the &quot;red rose&quot; thought 
<br>
experiment.
<br>
<p>The response, which I found convincing (I think from Eliezer) was than 
<br>
an AGI with a full understanding of physics in fact /would/ be able to 
<br>
progress from a physical description of Qualia to an understanding of 
<br>
the sensation.
<br>
<p>This is not inconsistent with materialism, nor is it inconsistent with 
<br>
your suggestion that Qualia are real and possibly observable objectively.
<br>
<p>I would say that (unless the AGI became a perfect actor) that an AGI 
<br>
should in fact be able to determine whether there is a conflict between 
<br>
materialism and Qualia. I do not think much more can be established 
<br>
about the topic given (at least my) current understandings of science.
<br>
<p>Personally, I also strongly query the validity of a physical reductivist 
<br>
in principle. I believe in an Objective Reality, but I also believe we 
<br>
see only a projection of it, much like the metaphor of the cave. It 
<br>
seems philosophically obvious that such thing is possible, and if 
<br>
possible, then one could reasonably suggest that Qualia objectively 
<br>
exists, but cannot be reduced into our understanding of physics due to 
<br>
limitations in our projection. The question is, simply, unanswered until 
<br>
we can make some concrete experiments to establish the facts.
<br>
<p>The broad terms of the experiment are simple: that some other experiment 
<br>
is not invariant under the experience of qualia, all else being equal.
<br>
<p>Your thoughts on this appreciated,
<br>
-T
