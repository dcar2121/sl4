<em>&gt; Do you have any particular references (preferably online)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for &quot;text summarization&quot; -- that is, the ability to extract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summaries or to paraphrase text and information?
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly text summarization, but I'd advice you to check the Pascal's
<br>
(nothing to do with the language) automated recognition of textual
<br>
entailment challenge.
<br>
<a href="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/Introduction/">http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/Introduction/</a>
<br>
<p>The idea is to generate an automatic process by which a sentence can be
<br>
recognized to be logically entailed from another. For example: Jane works as
<br>
an electrician in the weekends entails Jane is an electrician, Jane is a
<br>
human, etc. (Note that entailment itself generally has some common sense
<br>
issues, Jane could be a robot, but we'd hardly consider this at the moment.)
<br>
<p>I was doing some undergraduate-level work on this stuff, and the existing
<br>
approaches are very shallow, semantically speaking. The common thing to do
<br>
is using very very low-level metrics like Lvenshtein distance and such in
<br>
order to find markers of entailment, and the only group I know of (at
<br>
Edimburgh University) which went about it the Right Way (tm), building a
<br>
parser and trying to do some serious semantic work, gets a much worse
<br>
f-measure than the statistics-driven groups. Of course they get very very
<br>
good accuracy, but very bad recall, since their semantic analysis isn't
<br>
complete and many true entailments pass them by, but when they see one it is
<br>
almost sure there is one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (This is a field that interests me greatly.  Along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea of programs that write and optimize programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be where much of the leverage can be found; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where my own VERY modest efforts are directed.)
</em><br>
<p>--David.
