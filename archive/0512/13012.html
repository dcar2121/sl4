</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;is a much more tractable (though very hard) endeavour.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip my own paragraph in reply&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that Wilson's paragraph is not a sufficient explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider the concept of an optimization process: a system which hits 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small targets in large search spaces to produce coherent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real-world effects.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; An optimization process steers the future into particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regions of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.  I am visiting a distant city, and a local friend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to drive me to the airport.  I do not know the neighborhood.  When my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend comes to a street intersection, I am at a loss to predict my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend's turns, either individually or in sequence.  Yet I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can predict 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the result of my friend's unpredictable actions: we will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrive at the airport.  
</em><br>
<p>And here you have already made the assumption that your
<br>
&quot;friend&quot; is indeed friendly, and that (implicitly) your
<br>
friend is capable of finding the airport, and perhaps
<br>
more of a practical issue:  Your friend understands the
<br>
traffic patterns and your scheduled flight time well
<br>
enough to deliver you in time for some particular flight.
<br>
<p>Were you to see a road sign, Airport Next Right, and 
<br>
your friend were to bear left, you might begin to wonder
<br>
and even question your friends abilities.
<br>
<p>You presume you friend will deliver you on time for some
<br>
flight, but you are willing to revise this as additional
<br>
evidence arrives.
<br>
<p>I have literally had &quot;friends&quot; who felt that any trip
<br>
involved stopping somewhere along the route to &quot;have
<br>
a beer&quot;, and riding with them to the airport was not 
<br>
without trepidation (on several accounts.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Even if my friend's house were located elsewhere in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the city, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that my friend made a wholly different sequence of turns, I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as confidently predict our destination.  Is this not a strange 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation to be in, scientifically speaking?  I can predict 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outcome 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a process, without being able to predict any of the intermediate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steps in the process.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but do notice that your prediction is not guaranteed
<br>
but only a statistical prediction based on your level of
<br>
belief in your friend's &quot;friendliness&quot; and more practically
<br>
your friend's capabilities to arrive at the airport and
<br>
on time.
<br>
<p>We do this a thousand times a day -- we predict the outcome
<br>
of our own trips, to the mail box, the grocery store, to the
<br>
kitchen even, without knowing ahead of time if some event
<br>
will cause us to stop, detour, or engage in some intermediate
<br>
behavior (e.g., feed the cat, go around a real roadway detour
<br>
or traffic accident.)
<br>
<p>But we can NEVER KNOW for certain that we will arrive at
<br>
that location a priori.
<br>
<p>We can make our best effort, and the further the goal, the
<br>
fewer times we have &quot;made the trip&quot; the more doubt will be
<br>
included in our prediction.
<br>
<p>I am pretty sure I can make it to the kitchen, even the
<br>
local grocery store, but last week I took a wrong turn
<br>
(literally) on the way to the airport and got caught in a
<br>
local &quot;maximum&quot;:
<br>
<p>I could see the San Diega Airport control tower but had
<br>
arrived on the north end of the airport from which there is
<br>
no clear path to the passenger terminal.
<br>
<p>Of course, I KNEW that I would get to the airport, but my
<br>
conviction that it would be in time for my flight was 
<br>
seriously diminished until I was able to return to the
<br>
(main) path, highligted by signs such as &quot;Rental Car Return.&quot;
<br>
<p>[I made the airport and the flight in time, but I would not
<br>
have bet $1,000,000 on success during a period of several 
<br>
minutes.]
<br>
<p>We must be very careful about betting our lives, our futures,
<br>
and those of our loved ones on a &quot;guarantee&quot; of success.
<br>
<p>Again, don't confuse me with someone who says &quot;FAI cannot be
<br>
done&quot; but rather that it is going to be very near impossible
<br>
to know ahead of time if we will succeed in the friendly 
<br>
portion on our first (few) rampant attempts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider a car, say a Toyota Corolla.  Of all possible configurations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the atoms making up the Corolla, only an infinitesimal fraction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualify as a useful working car.  If you assembled molecules 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at random, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many many ages of the universe would pass before you hit on a car.  A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiny fraction of the design space does describe vehicles that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize as faster, more efficient, and safer than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corolla.  Thus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Corolla is not optimal under the designer's goals.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corolla is, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, optimized, because the designer had to hit a comparatively 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitesimal target in design space just to create a working 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car, let 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone a car of the Corolla's quality.  You cannot build so much as an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective wagon by sawing boards randomly and nailing according to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coinflips.  To hit such a tiny target in configuration space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires a powerful optimization process.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and we are reasonably certain that future optimization
<br>
attempts will be able to create both direct aerodynamic
<br>
simulations (to the extent this has not already been done) 
<br>
which will improve the Corolla OR be able to construct
<br>
replacements using nano (or other technology) that will
<br>
greatly improve this current/local maximum.
<br>
<p>Once the car can be optimized, as it were, in 'software',
<br>
the all (or almost) all bets are off about the final
<br>
form of the 'Corolla'.
<br>
<p>It may fly, it may not have a human driver, it may use
<br>
carbon fiber structural components, a new propulsion
<br>
system, or a host of other (within the design space)
<br>
improvements.
<br>
<p>Note:  Some of these, e.g., flying car, might be considered
<br>
&quot;unfriendly&quot; to the current FAA flight control system.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This strange balance sometimes confuses people, so that they conflate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity with randomness and begin to praise entropy.  
</em><br>
<p>Just as an aside (not relevant in this discussion):  I have
<br>
seen methods of TEACHING creativity which involve explicitly
<br>
showing real human beings how to engage (semi) random
<br>
processess to find new ideas for evaluation.
<br>
<p>These methods are highly effective; and some people who
<br>
are known for creativity were actually modeled to produce
<br>
the technique (i.e., some creative people use this 
<br>
technique both implicitly and explicitly.)
