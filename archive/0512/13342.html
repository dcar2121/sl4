</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure if you're just being hyperbolic, or if you actually
<br>
believe the things you're saying here.
<br>
<p>I've noticed, out of the corner of my eye, the discussion going on
<br>
here, and I decided not to become involved in it, but I do want to
<br>
comment on this, the capstone of the debate(seemingly).
<br>
<p>One, you make sweeping statements about the conduct and membership of
<br>
this list, when you have been interacting with largely two people,
<br>
John K Clark, and Jeff Medina. This is silly, and a little insulting
<br>
to the many other members.
<br>
<p>Two, the arguments thus far have had very little to do with scientific
<br>
conduct, scientific method, experimental design, etc, so please don't
<br>
try to make it sound more grand. The participants have been slinging
<br>
assertions at each other, in a seeming attempt to find the assertion
<br>
which is uncomfortable enough to silence the other person, there has
<br>
been little to no talk of experiments, no effects or processes posited
<br>
or disproven.
<br>
<p>Three, most people don't believe in psychic phenomena. I can't imagine
<br>
you haven't encountered that before. The idea that any group is going
<br>
to suddenly accept it because you mention scientific trappings it has,
<br>
and invest it with your personal authority(when to most of us you are
<br>
an abstraction, a name on the internet) is a little weak, and I find
<br>
you getting huffy about a poor reception kind of unbelievable.
<br>
<p>Finally, this is SL4. In case you haven't noticed, nearly no one is
<br>
participating in this argument, likely because it's not interesting to
<br>
them. If psi phenomena had robust theories that had effects on
<br>
ultratechnology of any stripe(remote viewing for example, supposedly
<br>
gives the user the ability to percieve anything at any scale, when I
<br>
read about it I immediately thought of nanotechnology and MEMS) it
<br>
would be a better topic.
<br>

P.S. This isn't really germane, but I also have to mention that I
really dislike anecdotal generalizations like &quot;in my experience,
dentists are much nicer people than emergency medical technicians&quot;.
It's lazy, and doesn't actually give much information, unless you
somehow have managed to scrub all the bias and selection effect from
your personal experience, which is unlikely.
