</em><br>
<p>No.  I think AI will result in humans being replaced with something &quot;better&quot;
<br>
or more intelligent (or perhaps coexisting but unaware of the AI).  I
<br>
mentioned it because most people do not want to risk human extinction.  So
<br>
far, bans on AI exist only in fiction, e.g. Herbert's Dune, &quot;thou shalt not
<br>
make a machine in the likeness of a human mind&quot;.  There is a possibility that
<br>
as more people become aware of the singularity that many would wish to avoid
<br>
it.  We have not solved the friendliness problem, and many possible bad
<br>
outcomes have been discussed.  A singularity is inherently unpredictable. 
<br>
This is a problem for AI research.
<br>
<p>My position is strictly neutral.  I am interested in forecasting where AI will
<br>
lead us, which means understanding not just technology and the dynamics and
<br>
limits of computation, but also how human motivation and ethics will drive the
<br>
design.  I won't say that any particular outcome is good or bad, because that
<br>
is just a statement about my own beliefs and ethics, which are irrelevant to
<br>
the outcome.
