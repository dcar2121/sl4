<em>&gt; &gt; The set of entities that benefit might be all presently-existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans, or it might be some smaller set of human individuals, or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might be all mammals, or one of many other possible choices.  Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone see a strategy for bringing rationality to bear on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; decision?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What decision?  We are building something many orders of magnitude more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually capable than ourselves and hopefully it will not eat our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face.   It is a bit odd to being worrying about what primates or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological creatures it will benefit as if we are likely to have much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable control over that.
</em><br>
<p>The emphasis is on &quot;WE are building...&quot; If we assume that we will have
<br>
some degree of control over the final ethical system of the AI (if we
<br>
don't, then we are screwed anyway), then we have some degree of
<br>
control as to whether other animals are included. Since we probably
<br>
won't be able to try more than once, knowing what we need to try is
<br>
vital.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is certainly a con job to sell it to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public and claim tax expropriations to build it on such a basis of being for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the benefit of the &quot;taxpayers&quot; or some other popular target requiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spending gobs of other people's money.
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite see the argument here (unless you're arguing that the
<br>
chances of an AI eliminating us are high). If the AI will refrain from
<br>
eliminating/enslaving/lobotomising us and if it provides great
<br>
benefits to all, then it seems that this has the strongest case for
<br>
coercive taxation (as the expected benefits far outweigh such things
<br>
as social security or a functioning police force).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why not make the beneficiaries all sentient/conscious beings?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What the heck does that even mean?  Benefits according to whom?
</em><br>
<p>Survival, and lack of excessive pain, would be reasonable benefits
<br>
even for dumb animals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best guesstimate of the best benefits each would desire if each of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings was much smarter and more sane and more generally enlightened than it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is or perhaps even dreams or can dream of being?   ARGH.    Hopefully the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI will not be nearly so sloppy in its thinking.    Hopefully we will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait to build AGI until we get sufficient political agreement that we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workable plan for uplifting the sea slug.
</em><br>
<p>I hope we don't put off building an AGI until we know how to uplift
<br>
the sea slug. I do hope, however, that we design an AGI that will
<br>
display some ethical behaviour towards at least some animals.
