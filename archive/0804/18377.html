Subject: Re: Platonic Computation and OMs
<br>
<p>details so many of the key issues surrounding this whole
<br>
topic that it warrants re-study. There is material in it that
<br>
we can mine for quite a while on this topic, and I think I'll
<br>
be returning again and again to it in order to explore
<br>
just what is meant by platonic computation.

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; My mind is apparently closely connected to my

<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; brain, not to patches of dust around the universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; and I worry a lot more about what happens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; my brain than about what happens to the dust.
</em><br>
<p>It's interesting to note the term &quot;happens&quot; in this sentence.
<br>
<p>That term denotes a process requiring temporal duration.
<br>
Later (see below) you again emphasize some kind of
<br>
temporal connection to the rest of the universe, and so
<br>
you seem to be repudiating here what I always thought
<br>
of as &quot;the theory of dust&quot; (e.g. taken from Permutation City).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; But if the whole universe is actually a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; in Platonia, all that means is that the computations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; giving rise to my mind through the process laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; physics -&gt; Big Bang -&gt; stars -&gt; planets -&gt; evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; of simple life etc. have much higher measure than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; those giving rise to a disembodied consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>You evidently do believe that our whole universe (the
<br>
level one Tegmark infinite universe) is a &quot;simulation in
<br>
Platonia&quot;, and the process
<br>
<p>physics -&gt; Big Bang -&gt; stars -&gt; planets -&gt; evolution
<br>
<p>is much more important in emulating you than would
<br>
be non-temporal (timeless) patterns exhibited here
<br>
and there randomly in the universe.
<br>
<p>To recall cases (B) and (C) again, we have
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;   B.  by fantastical means collect patches of dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        and load them sequentially   into memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        in such a manner that [the torture seems to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        be explicitly exhibited and] the sole difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        [between that and the usual dreadful events]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        being that there is no actual causal connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        between the states  [??]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   C.  just save the time and expense of the loading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        part of (B) and just leave them laying around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        in the solar system here and there after we've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        collected them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The difference between B and C is that B results in a structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that interacts with the local universe, like A. That it be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interact with its environment in a meaningful way is the reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the structure of an implementation of a computation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder to what extend it truly can be said to be interacting.
<br>
My original model, or intuitive example, was of watching an
<br>
extremely detailed film, e.g., Casablanca. Far from interacting
<br>
with the audience, the portrayed events are merely presented,
<br>
even the term &quot;simulation&quot; probably invoking incorrect
<br>
associations. 
<br>
<p>Loading a &quot;succession of frozen&quot; states formulaically---that is,
<br>
when the causal connection from one to the next is highly
<br>
suspect---strikes me as being &quot;uninvolved&quot; with the environment.
<br>
The series of apparent events unfolds quite independently of
<br>
the surroundings, (e.g. Turing Test examiners).
<br>
<p>It's only when we then introduce via a GLUT the possibility of
<br>
of the series of lookups not coming from &quot;the can&quot; (in movie
<br>
parlance) but from a huge tree of possible &quot;cans&quot; that concerns
<br>
for you first arise that these are not merely &quot;patches of dust&quot;,
<br>
whose patterns---as you have said---are not important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the structure of a conventional computer is sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damaged, then the computation in its useful, interactive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognisable form comes to end.
</em><br>
<p>And so this boils down to more discussion, I guess, about
<br>
the GLUT, whereas here I wanted more to get into Platonia,
<br>
so to speak.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if we are talking about a computation scattered in frames
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout time and space, it was never useful, recognisable or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactive to begin with; if it computes a consciousness, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness will be in an inputless virtual world. And since this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation was never going to interact with its environment anyway,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing is lost by disrupting the frames any which way. A hypothetical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer could look at any patch of dust and say that he can see how,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under a certain complicated transformation, it is isomorphic to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given computation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and then to both you and me, evidently, it would
<br>
be meaningless, or (as Bostrom apparently puts it), 
<br>
without moral or ethical implications, and certainly,
<br>
so far as you and I and the other readers here are
<br>
concerned, without invoking anticipatory dread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given any apparently random structure or process, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists in the possibility space of alien semantics a printout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which gives it any particular meaning. Now, while it is true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if we had the appropriate printout, the vibrations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms in a rock could be seen to spell out the King James
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bible, or simulate tomorrow's weather in Tokyo, it is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of trivial interest, because we don't have that printout.
</em><br>
<p>And it wouldn't matter if we did happen to?  After all,
<br>
that would only represent some work on the part of
<br>
a probably long-ago dead Alien civilization which had
<br>
read meaning into a process where it would have been
<br>
possible to read any meaning into it whatsoever.  Oh, 
<br>
but then perhaps I have got you wrong:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if we consider that the rock is implementing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computations which lead to conscious observers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is of greater interest; for there is no reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why the consciousness of the observers should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be contingent on whether we have the printout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but how likely do you consider it to be that
<br>
any given rock (for the sake of concreteness, 
<br>
weighing on Earth about the same as a human
<br>
being) is actually implementing conscious beings
<br>
with measure that is at least a significant fraction
<br>
of the computation that your body or mine is
<br>
implementing to give us experience?
<br>
<p>And following up that question, surely the entire
<br>
mass of the Earth's iron core must implement
<br>
you or me to such a tremendous extent that our
<br>
present metabolisms are relatively of almost 
<br>
zero significance?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, all possible computations are implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by mapping onto any physical process. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure is mostly contained in the mapping,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in the interesting case of computations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; containing observers, it is sufficient that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mapping merely exist in the abstract, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than as a hardcopy or even in the mind of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external observer.
</em><br>
<p>If it is sufficient that these mappings exist in the
<br>
abstract---which as a mathematical platonist
<br>
I surely do agree with you that they do---then
<br>
again, I don't quite follow what the significance
<br>
is of the fate of the particular Stathis organism
<br>
as it presently runs in Australia is all about.
