<em>&gt; What is interesting about a &quot;super AI&quot; is that it could run an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient command economy. And it could run it in ways that minimise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the negative philosophical consequences to people. Would we want that?
</em><br>
<p><p>It can do so iff people can express demand curves. If it knows I will buy 3
<br>
apples at $1 each, it has enough information to manage the status quo (which
<br>
the market can do just fine already). What it needs to know is how I would
<br>
react to apples at $2 or $4 -- and that's not even getting into how I react
<br>
when oranges fluctuate, too. A partial solution is for all of us to start
<br>
ceding control of our small purchases to automated agents that will, for
<br>
example, order more of stuff we like when it's cheap, hedge against the risk
<br>
of huge price increases, etc. I imagine that this will happen with fuel
<br>
first -- I suspect that most drives would prefer using derivatives to get a
<br>
flat price for gas to paying a fluctuating price at the pump.
<br>
<p>The problem with this is that the AI is suddenly redundant. The information
<br>
it gets from the agent transactions *is already being used by the agents* to
<br>
accomplish the same goals as the AI. All it can do to make things run better
<br>
is to create central clearinghouses for this information. And why would we
<br>
need an AI to know that collecting this information and managing
<br>
transactions would be a great business. All one has to do is look at the
<br>
current market value of the NYSE or CME or NASDAQ (the companies running the
<br>
exchanges, not the products traded on them) to know that this is an
<br>
incredibly profitable business.
