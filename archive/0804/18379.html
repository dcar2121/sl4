<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; That is what I meant.  But choose your own definition if you prefer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; If we could agree on a definition then the rest would be easy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm pretty leery of definitions (Korzybski explained very well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; how easy it is for Aristotelian definitions to be useless or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even dangerous), but I would say that consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the process whereby a program or operating brain reports
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; upon its own substates to itself, and is then able to distinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; these reports from the substates, (informally, &quot;so that they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be 'though about'&quot;.) I mean by &quot;substate&quot; a particular sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; organ's state or a report of a sense organ's state or a recall
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of some memory, all of which is recursive, so that a report
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of a report may be also considered to be a substate.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is admittedly pretty rough, but I've heard people say much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the same thing, and it sounded right to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In that case Homer without a hippocampus is conscious,
</em><br>
<p>You seem amazingly neutral about the meaning of such 
<br>
concepts. Are you so sure that mathematics is meaningful
<br>
to any of our inquiries if the real-world meanings of
<br>
any terms used in the math are entirely arbitrary?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but so are many computational processes, for example a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database that logs read-transactions to itself.
</em><br>
<p>I would suggest that yes, to a very minimal degree, programs
<br>
(and bacteria) achieve very minimal levels of consciousness.
<br>
Not only is this important for future actions that we may take,
<br>
e.g., whether to bother getting yourself cryopreserved or
<br>
uploaded, but is also a necessary guide to certain moral
<br>
actions (e.g. whether it is better for humans to go without
<br>
certain medical treatments or animals to suffer, and how
<br>
we might go about systematically arriving at consistent
<br>
answers).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But consciousness is just a distraction, a futile attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend our ethics to AI.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not quite sure why you consider it futile. After all,
<br>
you will sooner or later (assuming that things go well for you)
<br>
be in a position to choose certain outcomes at the expense
<br>
of certain other outcomes. Have you no desire for a guide
<br>
to which actions of yours will be consistent with other 
<br>
actions?  May I inquire as to whether you consider your
<br>
survival beyond normal human lifespan to be possible, and
<br>
if possible, desirable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which machines have rights?
</em><br>
<p>I shy away from the term &quot;rights&quot;, having found expressions
<br>
involving it to be very misleading or meaningless. For example,
<br>
you often hear &quot;X has the right to do Y&quot;, which so far as I
<br>
have ever been able to tell is equivalent to &quot;I (or we) approve
<br>
of X being able to do Y&quot;. 
<br>
<p>But to not evade your question, my own opinion is that of 
<br>
the two things that have contributed most to the progress
<br>
of western civilization, (1) respect for legal rights, (2) respect
<br>
for private property, it is the second which should take 
<br>
preeminence in these discussions.  In other words, we have
<br>
to begin by regarding the present owners of hardware and
<br>
software as entitled to do as they please with their property.
<br>
(Eliezer and I argued about this as early as 2001 or 2002,
<br>
however.)  Further comments about it should *definitely*
<br>
be begun in a different thread.  But you asked, and I have
<br>
answered here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is teleportation ethical?
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. In the first place, in my opinion (again) if any process
<br>
whatsoever is available, then any adult human being or other
<br>
citizen can freely utilize said process so far as it only directly
<br>
affects himself or herself. On the other hand, to teleport people
<br>
against their will would be as ethically questionable as, say,
<br>
strapping them onto a roller-coaster against their will, even
<br>
though we believe that ultimately the ride is harmless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Can I kill you if I just made a copy of you?)
</em><br>
<p>I would consider that to be very impolite. I do not approve
<br>
of one person going around making copies of arbitrary 
<br>
people he encounters. However, if I have granted you 
<br>
permission to make a copy of me, then in my opinion you
<br>
may do to the copy what you like, provided only that you
<br>
do not commit the immoral action of providing me with
<br>
additional experiences that have negative worth (e.g.
<br>
unpleasantness).  Again, I realize that these statements
<br>
are incendiary, and beg that new threads be started to
<br>
discuss any of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is a nondestructive upload really you?
</em><br>
<p>It *certainly* is me, if the upload has been what we call
<br>
successful, i.e., with any foreseeable realistic technology
<br>
we obtain a program that is functionally equivalent to me.
<br>
(Now *this* question does totally pertain to the subject
<br>
line, for, the heresy that I have committed is my specific
<br>
claim that under extreme conditions that are probably
<br>
impossible in practice, through a GLUT a fully functional
<br>
version of me could *appear* to be me, but actually 
<br>
have no experiences whatsoever.)
<br>
<p>Now to focus on one of your words, here, whether or not
<br>
it is *non-destructive*, as you have stipulated, is totally
<br>
irrelevant. The &quot;original&quot; may be lightyears away, and
<br>
so the upload at hand either has certain characteristics (e.g.
<br>
&quot;is me&quot;) or it doesn't. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Forget consciousness. Just do the math.
</em><br>
<p>I will again say that the writing of one mathematical equation
<br>
after another, unless the terms pertain to actual valid concepts
<br>
outside the mathematics, is only an exercise best left to those
<br>
just acquiring facility with mathematics.
