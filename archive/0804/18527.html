<em>&gt; Haven't we shown, through numerous experiments on a huge scale, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communism doesn't work? All of human civilization was built by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentives- people build things because it's better to build them than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to not build them. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we have.  I'm not arguing to eliminate incentives.  That would be silly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you abolish private property, you destroy all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those incentives, because everyone can just take whatever it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you've built. 
</em><br>
<p>Unless, of course, you replace them with more rational incentives.  The biggest problem with the way private property is implemented currently is that those who have the most private property are *NOT* those who have done the work and deserve it.  Private property (as currently implemented) *STINKS* as a rational incentive system (as well as leading to all sorts of unfairness and evil).
<br>
<p>The tragedy of the commons is entirely due to the irrationality of how we mentally handle property and property ownership and believe that just because we aren't *owners* of something that we have no incentives to treat it with respect.
