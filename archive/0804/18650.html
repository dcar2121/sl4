<p><em>&gt;&gt; But to answer your question properly, I'd have to delve a little into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; libertarianism, and my attitude towards it. Been meaning to do that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for some time, so let's do it!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pardon me.   Is this SL4?   If so then what the heck is such a very  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mundane discussion doing here?  Note that this question does not  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spring only from this post but from a slew of similar doubtful SL4  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material posts of late.
</em><br>
<p>I reluctantly agree with Samantha. But clearly Stuart's *point* 
<br>
was to explain the *reasons* why he would make certain choices.
<br>
Therefore, we ought to allude to our libertarianism, or our collectivism,
<br>
or our &quot;progressivism&quot; just in passing, and leave it up to people to
<br>
go google it. But here was Stuart's bottom line, which is SL4:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Now back to the &quot;vote to allow&quot;. If the following were true:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1) I was convinced that destructive teleportation was a form of murder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 2) I was convinced that if permitted, then DT would become ubiquitous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     and everyone would be pretty much forced (by non-coercive practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     considerations) to make use of it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 3) I was convinced that, if banned, DT would not come into general use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     on some form of black market,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 4) I was convinced that banning DT would not impose a huge burden on people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then I would vote to ban it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, so would I.   *If* I were convinced that destructive teleportation
<br>
is murder. You know that many of us don't. Maybe we've said enough
<br>
(or---for many people---way too much) on why it's not death for the
<br>
teleporting enthusiast. From the point of view of physics, as a number
<br>
of us have explained, the copy has all the important properties of the
<br>
original.
<br>
<p>There is more debate at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/PersonalIdentity">http://groups.google.com/group/PersonalIdentity</a>,
<br>
though I admit I haven't had time to drop in the last week or so.
