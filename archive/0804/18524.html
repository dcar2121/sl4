<em>&gt; I'm interested in answers to the question &quot;What do we want the AI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do?&quot;.

<p>From: Matt Mahoney &lt;<a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Arbitrarily%20decide%20who%20benefits%20(was%20Re:%20Bounded%20population)">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;In which context?  
</em><br>
<p>Right now, what do we want the AI to do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;What will we want the AI to do?&quot;  
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm not interested in extrapolating what I will want in the
<br>
future.  I'll deal with that in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We will want it to grant our wishes, to make us happy.  So that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what we will build.  But our evolved utility function does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maximize fitness when we can have everything we want.  We will upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into fantasy worlds with magic genies.  We will reprogram our brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to experience a million permanent orgasms.  We will go extinct.
</em><br>
<p>Do you want us to go extinct?  If not, then the scenario you describe
<br>
isn't what you want the AI to do.  If you do want us to go extinct,
<br>
then I hope you're a minority.
<br>
<p>You are making a valid point that we want the AI to have a planning
<br>
horizon that's large compared to the time required for addiction to
<br>
form, and perhaps also large compared to the time required for us to
<br>
go extinct.  Otherwise we can't tell the AI we don't want addiction or
<br>
extinction and expect it to help.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;What should we want the AI to do?&quot;  
</em><br>
<p>No, I didn't ask that and am not interested in that.  We want what we
<br>
want.  So far as I can tell, talk about what we should want just leads
<br>
to hypocrisy.  People say they should want things that sound nice but
<br>
are entirely unconnected with what they do want, and there's no way to
<br>
form a connection, so it's just hot air.
