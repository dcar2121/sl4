<em>&gt; &gt;I realize you can describe a simple guiding principle for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;such as &quot;increase total human utility&quot;.  But it is up to humans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;write the code that describes our utility function.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This assumes that humans can't write fairly compact code that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimates the human utility function, given human behavior as input.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have a specification of that code, and it's fairly simple.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could execute it if you had a Python interpreter running on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more-than-astronomically fast computer.  See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html">http://www.fungible.com/respect/paper.html</a>.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you wish to maintain your conclusion, you could argue that my spec
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is wrong, or that an implementation of it that really works on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buildable hardware would be incomprehensibly difficult.  I'd really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to see a good argument that my spec is wrong, so please go that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way if you have a choice.
</em><br>
<p>I believe your algorithm is correct.  It looks like your program is
<br>
based on AIXI^tl: enumerate all utility functions on time bounded
<br>
Turing machines of increasing complexity until a machine is found that
<br>
predicts a training set of observed human behavior.  Is this right? 
<br>
Have you estimated its run time?
<br>
<p>Earlier I estimated the human genome complexity is bounded by 10^7
<br>
bits. If we assume that 10% of it encodes the brain, then the
<br>
complexity of the &quot;hardcoded&quot; algorithm (complexity at birth) is 10^6
<br>
bits.  Your program also has to guess the laws of physics (409 bits*)
<br>
as well as human behavior, so you need to test 2^1000409 choices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;You cannot have any help from AI because that would mean the AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;helping to reprogram its own goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're splitting things into two pieces when you don't need to, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then arguing that each piece must precede the other so it can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done.  The two pieces are the AI writing code and the AI determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what its goals are.  It is possible to solve both problems at once by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting the code generation into the utility function.
</em><br>
<p>If you had enough computing power to run your algorithm, then you would
<br>
have solved AI long ago.  A faster algorithm (only 2^818 steps*) would
<br>
be to enumerate all laws of physics until a universe supporting
<br>
intelligent life is found.
<br>
<p>*I am assuming (1) this is how the universe was actually created, (2)
<br>
that the optimal time bound of a Turing machine of n bits is 2^n steps
<br>
by Schmidhuber's speed prior, (3) a universe whose state is described
<br>
using S bits cannot be simulated in less than S steps, (4) the fastest
<br>
algorithm for a given universe is most likely to be found first, (5) in
<br>
our universe, S = the Bekenstein bound of the Hubble radius = 2.91 x
<br>
10^122 bits ~ 2^409 bits.  Thus, simulating 2^409 universes for 2^409
<br>
steps each takes 2^818 step.
<br>
<p>Also, 409 bits seems to me about the right order of magnitude length of
<br>
a description of the fundamental laws of physics.
