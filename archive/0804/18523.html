<em>&gt; Okay, here's a question -- Do you know a way to do something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hutter's AIXI that has the concept of respect for private property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built in?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, here's an easier question: can you express the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private property formally?  (This omits the part about respecting it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it lets you pick the formalism.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are weird property-like things, like water rights, stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options, and patents.  A correct solution will have some process for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deciding who owns various parts of the moon, by the time it makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical difference.  Partial solutions are welcome.
</em><br>
<p>I can't prove it formally, yet -- but have you ever noticed that the very concept of private property, beyond the bounds of need, is probably the biggest contributor to evil in the world?
<br>
<p>Why should anyone *own* various parts of the moon?  If you aren't using it, why should you be able to hog it and insist that others pay you for the right to use it?
<br>
<p>Just because we've always done things like this in the past doesn't make it right for the future.  Ownership makes a lot of sense in conditions of scarcity but I strongly doubt that it is rational in conditions of plenty -- and in intermediate conditions, like those of today, I think that the concept of private property (and the necessity that everyone *must* work) is actually getting in the way of moving towards a condition of plenty (and fairness and happiness).
