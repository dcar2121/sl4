This thread, about Observer Moments and Computations
<br>
inherently taking place in &quot;platonia&quot;  continues a discussion
<br>
from &quot;The GLUT and Functionalism&quot;.

<em>&gt;&gt;  Allow me to elaborate slightly. A rogue branch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of the ANP (Australian National Police) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  considering whether to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  A.  seize citizen Stathis Papaioannou and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        torture him for an hour the old fashioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  B.  by fantastical means collect patches of dust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        in our (Tegmark) infinite level one universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        separated by millions or trillions of lightyears,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        and load them sequentially   into memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        in such a manner that the torture spoken of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        in (A) is apparently reproduced, the sole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        difference being that there is no actual causal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        connection between the states (which is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        important in my view)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  C.  just save the time and expense of the loading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        part of (B) and just leave them laying around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        in the solar system here and there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  D. don't bother even doing (C), but leave them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       be, and cause the normal Stathis metabolism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       to not operate for the hour, with only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       memories (i.e. the last state that has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       collected in (B) being implanted and normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       running resuming from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  At any rate, are you indifferent to A, B, C, and D?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My mind is apparently closely connected to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain, not to patches of dust around the universe,
</em><br>
<p>I am surprised that this is your view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and I worry a lot more about what happens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my brain than about what happens to the dust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if the whole universe is actually a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Platonia, all that means is that the computations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giving rise to my mind through the process laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics -&gt; Big Bang -&gt; stars -&gt; planets -&gt; evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of simple life etc. have much higher measure than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those giving rise to a disembodied consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the above, case (A) is interpreted as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computations giving rise to my mind taking an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpleasant turn for an hour.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is the normal, familiar case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Case (B) is equivalent, since the resulting brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would behave in exactly the same way as in (A).
</em><br>
<p>So it must be the localized sequential loading into
<br>
a specific piece of local hardware (e.g. a computer
<br>
or a body) that creates the unpleasantness here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But cases (C) and (D) are not constrained in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to be associated with my mind. They could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent any and every computation,
</em><br>
<p>and so therefore do not arouse the extreme 
<br>
condemnation or dread you have of cases
<br>
(A) and (B), right?
<br>
<p>Now (C) is the same as (B) in that isomorphic
<br>
representations of your (unpleasant) experience
<br>
are scattered here and there in the solar system.
<br>
I will later try to formulate intermediate cases
<br>
B1, B2, ...  between them to try to isolate the
<br>
point at which a bad (B) type situation becomes
<br>
a (C) type situation to which you are basically
<br>
indifferent. Anyway, they hardly represent
<br>
&quot;any and every computation&quot;, it seems to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the measure and kind of those computations in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dust giving rise to my mind is the same as the measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and kind of those computations in Platonia giving rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to my mind. The fact that any computation can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mapped onto any physical process, even the null state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is actually my justification for saying that every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation is necessarily implemented in Platonia.
</em><br>
<p>This has always seemed to me the weak spot in Putnam's
<br>
argument. Others too have commented that it is &quot;unnatural&quot;
<br>
to force any one thing to &quot;isomorphically&quot; line up with
<br>
another---it is as though the structure is being *added*
<br>
by whatever or whoever is &quot;finding&quot; such a relation, i.e.,
<br>
the isomorphism relation is not inherent in the structure
<br>
at the outset.
<br>
<p>But it could easily be that I don't understand Putnam or
<br>
your argument here fully. What is the defense to this last
<br>
criticism that I've recalled?
