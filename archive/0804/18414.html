<p>This seemed to be Yudkowsky's and Hanson's preferred resolution, if
<br>
that's what you mean. Note that such a resolution requires not just
<br>
acknowledging &quot;states with many people hurt have a low correlation
<br>
with what any random person claims to be able to effect&quot;, but that an
<br>
anthropomorphic law exists that makes them correlate to a
<br>
theoretically unlimited number of decimal points. In the sense that
<br>
the odds of me affecting 3^^^3 other humans is around ~(1/3^^^3),
<br>
rounded to the nearest hundred orders of magnitude, I am
<br>
&quot;axiomatically ineffectual&quot; in this framework.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  this doesn't seem to apply because there is no
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  relatively small number of extremely valuable posthumans.
</em><br>
<p>Presumably, in the given resolution, because the FAI is caused by we
<br>
axiomatically-ineffectual humans 21st century humans, this means the
<br>
FAI is axiomatically ineffectual as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If the Friendly utility function is bounded, that would very likely
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, I think you understand the issues, the root problem is that our
<br>
desires are fundamentally incoherent; there is no simple solution that
<br>
will satisfy all of our moral intuitions. To say in this case,
<br>
&quot;therefore we must bound our utility function&quot; (or create a new
<br>
anthropomorphic rule, or discount tiny probabilities, or sentence
<br>
mankind to almost certain death to try to save 3^^^3 strangers) does
<br>
not *necessarily* follow, however; we create rules to describe and
<br>
accomplish the things we desire in life, warping our desires to reduce
<br>
our Kolmogorov complexity is not necessarily always the way to go.
<br>
<p>It is definitely a topic that deserves a lot of thought.
