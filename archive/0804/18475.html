<p><em>&gt; I have known several different pairs of identical twins 
</em><br>
<p>My older sisters are identical twins, even when I was a kid I never had
<br>
any difficulty telling them apart, although very few others could, even
<br>
our parents sometimes got confused; but the fact that I could tell them
<br>
apart, even from behind (they moved differently), must mean that the
<br>
word “identical” in the term “identical twins” is misnamed. They should
<br>
be called “similar twins”. Their personalities were not identical
<br>
either, certainly both could provide a long list of faults that their
<br>
twin has, faults that of course they themselves lacked. They are two
<br>
distinct individuals no argument.

<p>If that is what you mean by destructive teleportation, then I agree, it
<br>
would be murder most foul! However if the “original” (and I defy anyone
<br>
to define that word without talking about atoms) is destroyed before it
<br>
has time to form one conscious thought then I would walk into the
<br>
teleportation machine without a worry in the world.
