<em>&gt; &gt; Forgive me, for I have sinned.  I swatted a mosquito and deleted some

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sorry.  I don't see a sin here.  You swatted a mosquito that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempting to feed upon you (That is your right).  Files are not thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities.  And, at your current stage of development, you are healthiest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eating lower life forms (as long as you only kill them for a real purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and don't torment them in doing so).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you feel that you need forgiveness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You should only do those acts for which you are comfortable that you won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to ask for forgiveness (i.e. those acts where most people would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you are fully justified in acting that way).  I think that all of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts apply.
</em><br>
<p>So instead of being equally friendly to all intelligences, now you say an act
<br>
is ethical if most people believe it is ethical.  How does this work for
<br>
animal rights, abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, and teleportation? 
<br>
(You want to go from point A to point B.  After your copy appears at B, is it
<br>
ethical to kill you at A?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I've seen and believe that I understand your beliefs.  May I ask you to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself to the possibility that the dark, gloomy future that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portray is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; merely fearful conservatism and that the future could easily turn out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a wonderful, glorious thing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or the possibility of both at the same time, depending on the goals of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  Not really.  If the future makes *everyone's* goals more possible, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sick and twisted (defined as those who want to hurt themselves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others -- aka UnFriendlies) will be unhappy -- and the environment will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that these will heal and others won't be created.
</em><br>
<p>So if the world is turned into gray goo then that is good as long as the
<br>
nanobots achieve their goals, or am I missing something?  (The nanobots would
<br>
declare the humans unfriendly because they use too many resources (thus
<br>
hurting others) and because they refuse to upload (thus hurting themselves by
<br>
refusing immortality)).
