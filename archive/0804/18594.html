<p><em>&gt; Large sections of the population are inadequately treated
</em><br>
<p>Many people receive poor medical care  because medicine is so expensive
<br>
and it’s expensive because of government and its ridiculous restrictions
<br>
and licensing requirements.
<br>
<p>You go to the doctor, your appointment is at 10 am so you cool your
<br>
heals for 3 hours and at 1 pm he kindly deems to grant you an audience,
<br>
for about 4 minutes. After you kiss his ring you hurriedly tell him your
<br>
health problem while the doctor looks at his watch and glances at you
<br>
test results, he then gives you a prescription, a permission slip to buy
<br>
a drug as if you were a child, he then sends you on your way. You then
<br>
give the doctor a big fee, go to the drug store with your permission
<br>
slip in your hand, and the doctor buys a Ferrari. This is nuts. Most of
<br>
the time a nurse or a computer program could diagnose your problem as
<br>
well as the highly paid doctor. True you could be suffering from some
<br>
extremely rare bizarre ailment that would take a Sherlock Holmes (or a
<br>
Dr. House) to diagnose, but you know what, you probably aren't. It's
<br>
possible those tracks were made by a zebra, but they were probably made
<br>
by a horse.
<br>
<p>Granted no computer program is (yet)as good at diagnoses as a genius
<br>
doctor who is willing to devote significant time thinking about it, but
<br>
I maintain a computer program will give at least as good a diagnosis as
<br>
you are likely to receive in the real world. I think surgery is the only
<br>
area where a very skilled human being is still needed, at least for now.
<br>
<p>So to sum up, ALL prescriptions should be over the counter, including
<br>
Heroin.
