<em>&gt;&gt;  The fact that AGi ethics is incredibly badly understood right now, and

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For any of the many people who agree with Ben's sentiment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Large numbers of people have made various AI advances in the past. In
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory.&quot; 
</em><br>
Because FAI was and is completely and utterly irrelevant to the level of 
<br>
AI to date.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would we expect this to change in the future? At the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, doesn't this show that even if FAI advances require AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances, the &quot;bottleneck&quot; is that there are too few people working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deriving FAI from existing AGI, rather than too few people working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing AGI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
There isn't enough progress in current AGI to derive any FAI from.  So 
<br>
why should any people be doing needlessly attempting such a thing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are there specific facts about AGI that you're waiting to find out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that if the result of a pending experiment is A, then successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI theory lies in one direction, but if the result is B, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful FAI theory lies in a different direction? If so, what are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such facts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
FAI isn't relevant if AGI does not exist.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At what point will you know that AGI has advanced enough that FAI can proceed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
When it actually begins remotely to matter in that we have AGI that is 
<br>
even at the level of a dog much less capable of doing us significant 
<br>
harm.   But it isn't a question of whether FAI can proceed but of 
<br>
whether it is relevant and whether it can make any real progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For SIAI specifically: how is OpenCog going to be &quot;coupled&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;dramatic advances in AGI ethical theory&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<p>AGI ethical theory?   What a fine intellectual abstraction.   But that 
<br>
seems to be all it is at this point.
