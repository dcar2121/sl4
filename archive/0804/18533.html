<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;survive&quot; isn't a well defined term in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; post-singularity world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don’t care, definitions are of trivial importance, and it’s foolish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask for a definition of “definition”, if you already know you don’t need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ask and if you don’t then the question makes no sense. To hell with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions, examples rule! 
</em><br>
<p>For example, your willingness to step into a teleportation booth and die,
<br>
provided that an exact copy of you is made at the same instant, but not if it
<br>
is made 10 seconds earlier.
<br>
<p>Humans evolved a fear of a large number of things that can kill us: hunger,
<br>
drowning, falling, sharp objects, extreme heat and cold, etc.  We summarize
<br>
these as &quot;fear of death&quot;, but it isn't really.  Animals and children are not
<br>
aware that they will die.  After all, they never have before, so why should
<br>
they expect to?
<br>
<p>On close analysis, our logic leads us to absurdities such as the teleportation
<br>
example.  If consciousness resides in the brain, and the brain is a computer,
<br>
then what we want to preserve must be its memories and function.  But if your
<br>
memories were altered, you would not know the difference.  If your goals were
<br>
altered, you would not want them changed back to what they were.  So what is
<br>
it really that you want to preserve?
