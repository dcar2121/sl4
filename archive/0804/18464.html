<p>
I think that the right kind of investigation of Friendliness should in
<br>
fact help in AGI, not the other way around. It should be able to
<br>
formulate the problem that actually needs solving, in a form that can
<br>
be addressed. The main question of Friendliness theory is how to build
<br>
a system that significantly helps us (which results in great changes
<br>
to us and the world), while at the same time (with the goal of)
<br>
preserving and developing things that we care about.
<br>
<p>This role looks very much like what intelligence should do in general.
<br>
Currently, intelligence enables simple drives inbuilt in our biology
<br>
to have their way in situations that they can never comprehend and
<br>
which were not around at the time they were programmed in by
<br>
evolution. Intelligence empowers these drives, allows them to deal
<br>
with many novel situations and solve problems which they can't on
<br>
their own, while carrying on what their intention was.
<br>
<p>This process is not perfect, so in modern environment some of purposes
<br>
don't play out. People eat wrong foods and become ill, or decide not
<br>
to have many children. Propagation of DNA is no longer a very
<br>
significant goal for humans. This is an example of subtly Unfriendly
<br>
AI, the kind that Friendliness-blind AGI development can end up
<br>
supplying: it works great at first and *seems* to follow its intended
<br>
goals very reliably, but in the end it has all the control and starts
<br>
to ignore initial purpose.
<br>
<p>Grasping the principles by which modification to a system results in a
<br>
different dynamics that can be said to preserve intention of initial
<br>
dynamics, while obviously altering the way it operates, can, I think,
<br>
be a key to general intelligence. If this intention-preserving
<br>
modification process is expressed on low level, it doesn't need to
<br>
have higher-level anthropic concepts engraved on its circuits, it even
<br>
doesn't need to know about humans. It can be a *simple* statistical
<br>
creature. All it needs is to extrapolate the development of our corner
<br>
of the universe, where humans are the main statistical anomaly. It
<br>
will automatically figure out what does it mean to be Friendly, if
<br>
such is its nature.
