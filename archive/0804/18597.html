<p><p>It is kind of hard to have large sections of the population being  
<br>
inadequately treated in fact while still maintaining the best outcome  
<br>
statistics in the world and among the very highest medical life  
<br>
expectancies (i.e. after removing homicide, accidents, and similar).   
<br>
If the aggregate statistics across the population are as good as they  
<br>
are *and* you have large populations being inadequately treated in  
<br>
substantial ways, then the US must have a large population that is  
<br>
enjoying nearly perfect medical outcomes across all diseases to  
<br>
produce the statistical results we are seeing.  Unfortunately, I do  
<br>
not think anyone is making the assertion that a large population is  
<br>
getting medical outcomes that radically outperform the average for the  
<br>
United States, which is already the best, though as a consequence it  
<br>
is hard to square the assertion that a large population is receiving  
<br>
material substandard medical results by, say, European standards.
<br>
<p>All of which assumes that the measure of &quot;adequate treatment&quot; is  
<br>
positive medical outcomes.  Perhaps you have some other criteria for  
<br>
what constitutes adequate healthcare.
<br>
<p>Of course, the United States has socialized medicine, it just is not a  
<br>
Federal function.  One of the great lies of the universal healthcare  
<br>
debate is that there is not a public healthcare system now; what does  
<br>
not exist now is a public *Federal* system.  I grew up using the  
<br>
public healthcare system, so it sure is funny to hear about its non- 
<br>
existence.  Using the same reasoning, universal public education did  
<br>
not exist until the mid-20th century in the United States.
