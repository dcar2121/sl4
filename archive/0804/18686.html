</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that some essential features of the FAI are arbitrary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most important arbitrary feature I can see, for the purpose of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any point in waiting for a political consensus.  A few hours 
<br>
checking out current politics worldwide should be sufficient to show 
<br>
that humanity and human politics is utterly incapable of understanding 
<br>
and making a rational democratic decision on such a subject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The set of entities that benefit might be all presently-existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, or it might be some smaller set of human individuals, or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be all mammals, or one of many other possible choices.  Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone see a strategy for bringing rationality to bear on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision?  
</em><br>
What decision?  We are building something many orders of magnitude more 
<br>
intellectually capable than ourselves and hopefully it will not eat our 
<br>
face.   It is a bit odd to being worrying about what primates or other 
<br>
biological creatures it will benefit as if we are likely to have much 
<br>
reasonable control over that.    It is certainly a con job to sell it to 
<br>
the public and claim tax expropriations to build it on such a basis of 
<br>
being for the benefit of the &quot;taxpayers&quot; or some other popular target 
<br>
requiring spending gobs of other people's money.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Otherwise it's arbitrary and there will probably be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tedious and depressing political battle over it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
We don't have time for this, do we?
