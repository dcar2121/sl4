<p>I'm trying to highlight some assumptions in the notion of self-hood.
<br>
When we understand what a &quot;self&quot; is, we should be able to extend it.
<br>
Why build new separate ones?
<br>
<p>What do you think would be required for a computer to be part of your
<br>
&quot;self&quot;, rather than its own &quot;self&quot;? You are assuming that all
<br>
computers will always be other &quot;selves&quot;, I don't think it is going to
<br>
end up like that.
<br>
<p>I think the computer systems most adapted to being replicated by our
<br>
current economic-industrial system will be ones without their own
<br>
self-hood.
