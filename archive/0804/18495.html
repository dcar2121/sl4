<p><em>&gt;&gt;  As you know, I go even further and if one of my copies had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  die, they wouldn't particularly care which, so long as some ample
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  reward to the remaining ones was provided.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would you continue to say this no matter how differentiated your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies became?  (In other words, no matter how long the time period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was?)  If so, then I think we have stumbled upon a real-world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between our opinions.  So maybe it's not just an issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language after all :)
</em><br>
<p>No, eventually my copy will turn into a different person, as in the
<br>
example you provided (omitted). I figure it's the same rate that
<br>
I become someone else anyway, i.e., I'd say that at about age
<br>
19 I was 50% the person I am today, and I would expect that
<br>
at the rate I change, I'll won't become 50% different again for
<br>
many, many more decades. (Of course these numbers are pure
<br>
guesswork, but they convey my attitude: no sacrifice---supposing
<br>
I'm a Most Selfish Individual---for a copy unless it's recent (i.e.
<br>
a few years or so).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Because they're *so much* less identical than physical duplicates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  we thought it a weak attack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that twins are less identical than physical duplicates.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical duplicates are only identical at the microsecond of copying,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and become more and more differentiated as time goes on.  Far into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, they are almost as different as the twins.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, strictly speaking the twins are physical duplicates as well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were just duplicated in the egg before being born.  Since a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of our behavior is determined by things that happen to us before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; birth, they have had a lot of time to become different.  The copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made later on have had less time, and they share a significant portion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their memories. But other than that, I don't see how it is any different.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely.
