2008/4/23 Matt Mahoney &lt;<a href="mailto:matmahoney@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Balance%20of%20power%20was%20Re:%20Can't%20afford%20to%20rescue%20cows">matmahoney@yahoo.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I believe the friendliness problem needs to be studied in this context (as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  forecast) rather than as an engineering problem.  When most of the computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  power on the internet is carbon based, there is an economic incentive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  attach specialists that serve the interests of humans.  Machines compete for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  human attention in a market where information has negative value.  When the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  balance of power shifts to silicon, machines will compete more for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  attention (and computing resources) of other machines.
</em><br>
<p>I think it matters more how the utility functions or equivalent
<br>
computational process(es) that determine what the systems does and
<br>
finds important are implemented (silicon/carbon) than pure compute
<br>
power.
<br>
<p>Currently what your PC does is entirely under your control or another
<br>
humans (your can always reformat to another OS, if you dislike
<br>
windows). I think it likely that most silicon compute power will
<br>
become slaved to human desires at least to start with, due to
<br>
economics. It would be as if the silicon was an external part of the
<br>
brain. Only situations where the compute power is very separated from
<br>
humans (e.g. undersea/space exploration), is it likely to have morphic
<br>
intent per se.
<br>
<p>Later on we might well get, &quot;Mind Children&quot;, when we have
<br>
significantly better understanding of the brain, and people
<br>
instantiate their morphic intention* in silicon.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Will Pearson
<br>
<p>* Morphic intent is a concept I have been playing around with, but
<br>
haven't quite polished. It is what the system desires to become. A
<br>
systems morphic intent need not be the same as the obvious intent. If
<br>
it was a young child would never grow up from wanting their favourite
<br>
book read to them. Similarly no one would become addicted to heroin.
