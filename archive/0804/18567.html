</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Still some confusions (I see G as a function on S - it takes one state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the system, and gives you another (subsequent) state, so is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; function)! But the main ideas are there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Perhaps we resolve this by noting that the first GLUT (involving no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hashing) has entries that *are* polynomials, or which *are* states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of a computer or brain, or which *are* generations of the Life Board?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Maybe we are saying the same thing? It's probably a minor point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but I like math, and precision feels good  :-)
</em><br>
<p>A function f on S is something which, if given an element s of S,
<br>
gives another element f(s) of S. A GLUT is something which, if given
<br>
an s of S, gives the &quot;next state&quot;, which is also an element of S.
<br>
Hence GLUT's are functions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is especially true if you consider &quot;partial truths&quot;: a partial truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on a GLUT is just some sort of sub-GLUT, a partial truth of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory of consciousness can be considerably simpler (even relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the theory of consciousness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Very interesting. Sort of parallel to partial function. Might examples be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (A) suppose that the huge GLUTh or GLUTa passes not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      a Turing Test, but convinced several people, each given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      three hours, that it is conscious as well as intelligent. (B) a subset
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of (A) consisting of the first hour for each interrogator
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      (with the GLUT becoming suddenly silent afterwards)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (C) a subset of (A) but with gaps, so that (I believe) the GLUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      just ignores many questions, though somehow seems aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      in many cases that it had failed to answer, or aware that     in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion the interrogator had been off-line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If these don't work, then I'm not following your last paragraph.
</em><br>
<p>My last paragraph is the idea that started the whole thing. Let us
<br>
imagine that a GLUTh can recognise friend's faces on a computer
<br>
screen, and write down their names. This GLUTh could also pass a full
<br>
Turing test (and thus qualifies as conscious).
<br>
<p>However, here I have briefly described a condition (recognise people's
<br>
faces) which is an easily described sub-category of being a conscious
<br>
human. However, if we were to define the sub-GLUTh needed to perform
<br>
that task, then that definition is not much simpler than the GLUTh
<br>
itself. Hence translating the task &quot;recognising friend's faces&quot; into
<br>
GLUT terms is punishing, even if we know that &quot;recognising friend's
<br>
faces&quot; is a subset of what we generally accept to be human
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>So some sub-properties of consciousness are easy to describe, even if
<br>
their hash equivalents are nearly as hard as consciousness itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Julian Barbour wrote, as you probably know, a book with that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  title, and there are other theories which attempt to reduce time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to something else (e.g. configuration space or mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  structures in Platonia). I still want to avoid having to believe in those,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for several reasons, most notably because it *could*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (in my eyes, at least) reduce moral decisions to gibberish.
</em><br>
<p>Moral decisions have their portion of gibberish - the basic axioms of
<br>
ethics are arbitrary. As we explore deeper concepts, we have to keep
<br>
in mind that if we throw away things that don't make perfect sense, we
<br>
end up throwing away everything.
