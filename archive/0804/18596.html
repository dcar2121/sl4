Stathis writes (and I find it quite on-topic since the points generalize very
<br>
quickly and pertinently to OSs and ruling AIs).

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I would argue with that:  especially provided that the government is
<br>
not regulating the businesses and corporations, the bottom-line
<br>
profit and need to compete successfully minimizes corruption under
<br>
free-market capitalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could it be that, um, empirically, it has been found that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is better at others?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeed, government is *definitely* vastly superior to private
<br>
enterprise in some things, only a little bit superior in others, and
<br>
actually quite inferior in many.  Here's how I rate government
<br>
(as opposed to private).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;10     waging war  (e.g. USSR vs. Germany, North Korea vs. South, etc.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7     building roads and some other infrastructure
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7     schools (pre-1950)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6     epidemiology nation-wide defenses (though Rafal's opinion would be neat)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2     regulating stock markets (again, it may be 2 now, but is perhaps going down)
<br>
&nbsp;-1      regulating telecommunications 
<br>
&nbsp;-4      schools (post-1950)
<br>
&nbsp;-6      providing health care (of course, we know we disagree about that!)
<br>
&nbsp;-9      distributing food and probably all merchandise
<br>
<p>But this may merely reflect that I am a libertarian---almost a minimalist---
<br>
but by no means an anarchist.
<br>
<p>Beings who think millions of times faster than we do might want 
<br>
a Solar System government, but for very, very few things that I
<br>
can think of.
<br>
<p>I suppose that some solar systems will eventually attack others
<br>
(as in The Golden Age), and just like the Soviets and the NKVD
<br>
---which made their soldiers more afraid of who was behind them
<br>
than who they were fighting---a ruling Solar Government may
<br>
have to organize Solar Defense, commandeer resources, and so on.
<br>
<p>Maybe something else corresponding to infrastructure or communications?
<br>
Anything else whatsoever?
