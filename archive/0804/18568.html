<em>&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  I guess my question would be why you value your life more than your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  copy's, if you are both identiical aside from a few neurons here and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  there?  They both should have roughly the same value to you.
</em><br>
<p>To answer your question from my personal perspective: My personal code
<br>
of ethics is what I believe would be better for the world. My actual
<br>
behaviour is more complicated, parasited by actions that are better
<br>
for me personally.
<br>
<p>Therefore, after all these arguments, I believe that there would be no
<br>
ethical problem with destructive teleportation with instant
<br>
destruction. I'm also pretty convinced that teleportation with a ten
<br>
second delay before destruction is fine, maybe even if the &quot;original&quot;
<br>
is conscious and aware during that time.
<br>
<p>However, I would not accept to be that ten second delayed one, and
<br>
then be destroyed (and so I would not put myself through the procedure
<br>
in the first place, as that ends up with some version of me put in
<br>
that position). My fear of death is reduced by the knowledge that
<br>
there is another copy of me out there - but only slightly. Not enough
<br>
to make me accept my destruction without major incentives. (in terms
<br>
of your question: both copies have same value for me before the split,
<br>
but after the split, the &quot;me&quot; who is destined to be destroyed would
<br>
overvalue himself over the other one. If there was arena, they'd fight
<br>
each other for survival).
<br>
<p>So, if I was an MP, I would probably vote to allow most forms of
<br>
destructive teleportation if the issue came up - but would be
<br>
terrified of trying them out myself.
<br>
