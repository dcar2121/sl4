</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  At any rate, are you indifferent to A, B, C, and D?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My mind is apparently closely connected to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain, not to patches of dust around the universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I am surprised that this is your view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and I worry a lot more about what happens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my brain than about what happens to the dust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But if the whole universe is actually a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in Platonia, all that means is that the computations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; giving rise to my mind through the process laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physics -&gt; Big Bang -&gt; stars -&gt; planets -&gt; evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of simple life etc. have much higher measure than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those giving rise to a disembodied consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given the above, case (A) is interpreted as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computations giving rise to my mind taking an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unpleasant turn for an hour.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes, that is the normal, familiar case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Case (B) is equivalent, since the resulting brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would behave in exactly the same way as in (A).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So it must be the localized sequential loading into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a specific piece of local hardware (e.g. a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or a body) that creates the unpleasantness here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But cases (C) and (D) are not constrained in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way to be associated with my mind. They could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; represent any and every computation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and so therefore do not arouse the extreme condemnation or dread you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (A) and (B), right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Now (C) is the same as (B) in that isomorphic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  representations of your (unpleasant) experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are scattered here and there in the solar system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I will later try to formulate intermediate cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  B1, B2, ...  between them to try to isolate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  point at which a bad (B) type situation becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a (C) type situation to which you are basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  indifferent. Anyway, they hardly represent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;any and every computation&quot;, it seems to me.
</em><br>
<p>The difference between B and C (or D) is that B results in a structure
<br>
that interacts with the local universe, like A. That it be able to
<br>
interact with its environment in a meaningful way is the reason why
<br>
the structure of an implementation of a computation is important. If
<br>
the structure of a conventional computer is sufficiently damaged then
<br>
the computation in its useful, interactive, recognisable form comes to
<br>
end. But if we are talking about a computation scattered in frames
<br>
throughout time and space, it was never useful, recognisable or
<br>
interactive to begin with; if it computes a consciousness, that
<br>
consciousness will be in an inputless virtual world. And since this
<br>
computation was never going to interact with its environment anyway,
<br>
nothing is lost by disrupting the frames any which way. A hypothetical
<br>
observer could look at any patch of dust and say that he can see how,
<br>
under a certain complicated transformation, it is isomorphic to any
<br>
given computation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and the measure and kind of those computations in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dust giving rise to my mind is the same as the measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and kind of those computations in Platonia giving rise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to my mind. The fact that any computation can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mapped onto any physical process, even the null state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is actually my justification for saying that every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computation is necessarily implemented in Platonia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This has always seemed to me the weak spot in Putnam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  argument. Others too have commented that it is &quot;unnatural&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to force any one thing to &quot;isomorphically&quot; line up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  another---it is as though the structure is being *added*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by whatever or whoever is &quot;finding&quot; such a relation, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the isomorphism relation is not inherent in the structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  at the outset.
</em><br>
<p>Given any apparently random structure or process, there exists in the
<br>
possibility space of alien semantics a printout which gives it any
<br>
particular meaning. Now, while it is true that if we had the
<br>
appropriate printout, the vibrations of the atoms in a rock could be
<br>
seen to spell out the King James Bible, or simulate tomorrow's weather
<br>
in Tokyo, it is only of trivial interest, because we don't have that
<br>
printout. But if we consider that the rock is implementing
<br>
computations which lead to conscious observers, this is of greater
<br>
interest; for there is no reason why the consciousness of the
<br>
observers should be contingent on whether we have the printout or not.
<br>
Thus, all possible computations are implemented by mapping onto any
<br>
physical process. The structure is mostly contained in the mapping,
<br>
but in the interesting case of computations containing observers, it
<br>
is sufficient that the mapping merely exist in the abstract, rather
<br>
than as a hardcopy or even in the mind of an external observer.
