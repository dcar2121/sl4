<p>
First, a word about cows. I have been told that
<br>
much of the beef we eat comes from animals bred
<br>
to grow and fatten as quickly as possible to the
<br>
exclusion of other considerations. They have
<br>
abnormal digestive systems for an ungulate; more
<br>
acid than normal, which means they pass parasites
<br>
better able to live in humans as well; and
<br>
dysfunctional so that if they were not
<br>
slaughtered at a youngish age they would soon die
<br>
from digestive problems anyway.
<br>
<p>When I ask myself the (mostly unanswerable)
<br>
question &quot;What would a superhuman FAI do?&quot; I
<br>
understand it as a variation of &quot;What would God
<br>
do?&quot; if such an entity existed. Any answer that
<br>
is too stupid for me is clearly too stupid for
<br>
anybody smarter than me. Present methods of
<br>
making beef are very inefficient, requiring
<br>
massive amounts of water and land. Use of
<br>
antibiotics in these creatures is daft: by the
<br>
time a new antibiotic is approved for humans,
<br>
bacteria have already started to become immune to
<br>
it since it will have been in heavy livestock use
<br>
for some time! Everything about the present
<br>
existence of domesticated cattle seems to
<br>
guarantee inherent wretchedness in the enslaved
<br>
(no quotes) animals. 
<br>
<p>Here's what I think a FAI would do:
<br>
<p>1. Feed humans on artificially grown beef where
<br>
no sentient/conscious suffering is even a factor.
<br>
There are artificial meats and fish made from
<br>
soy, TVP, and probably other plant sources, which
<br>
are uncannily close to the real thing, though not
<br>
easy to find. A FAI would presumably find much
<br>
better methods to solve this minor problem.
<br>
<p>2. There might still be some cows around, but
<br>
they'd be healthier and probably far fewer and
<br>
freer. If I were a FAI trying to allocate
<br>
meatspace to nonhumans, I'd cut way back on
<br>
livestock and leave much more room for nonhuman
<br>
primates, elephants, whales and porpoises. They
<br>
have something to contribute to the conversation
<br>
(see Frans de Waal, &quot;Our Inner Ape&quot;.)
<br>
<p>3. This assumes the continued existence of
<br>
meatspace. Otherwise, all bets are off.
