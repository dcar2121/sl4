<em>&gt;  By the way, Jeff mentioned that it would be cruel and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the problem by supposing---of course, entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hypothetically---that Matt (or whoever is speaking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  i.e., the subject of the query) is what I have called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  an MSI (a most selfish individual). We wish to ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  what an MSI would do, and what are the logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reasons one way or the other for his choices, given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that the MSI values existing.
</em><br>
<p>I think the question of what a &quot;most selfish&quot; individual would do is
<br>
not well-defined, since the self is not well-defined.  It all depends
<br>
on which future copies of you you regard as your &quot;future self&quot;, which
<br>
is purely a language convention.
<br>
<p>To add to Matt's original thought experiment, here are a chain of
<br>
related thought experiments I find interesting:
<br>
<p>1. Is it ethical to use a &quot;date rape&quot; drug on someone who isn't going
<br>
to remember much in the morning, but will be unable to resist your
<br>
advances during the night?
<br>
<p>2.  Is it ethical to rape someone and then erase their memories
<br>
completely (or fix them afterwards so that they believe it never
<br>
happened, or they have a blackout)?
<br>
<p>3.  Is it ethical to torture someone and then erase their memories of it?
<br>
<p>4.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
<br>
&quot;don't worry, I'll erase your memory later.&quot;
<br>
<p>5.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
<br>
&quot;don't worry, I've made a backup of your brain and I will use it to
<br>
make an exact copy of you on my home planet, as soon as I figure out
<br>
how to do so... which should only take a few years.  I'm not going to
<br>
torture your copy when it wakes up, so it's fine if I torture you now.
<br>
&nbsp;In fact, I'm going to kill you soon so it won't matter at all.  Your
<br>
copy won't remember any of this.&quot;?
<br>
<p>6.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
<br>
&quot;don't worry I've *already* made a copy of you, so you are redundant&quot;.
<br>
<p>7.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
<br>
&quot;don't worry, I've already made a copy of you *and* I'm going to erase
<br>
your memories soon, so you won't be you at all but the copy will be.&quot;
<br>
<p>8.  Would you be fine with such torture happening to you, as long as a
<br>
copy was made somewhere else, and as long as you consented to it
<br>
beforehand?
<br>
<p>I think number 8 is essentially the question that Matt is asking...
<br>
but I don't really see how 8 is different from 7, 7 is different from
<br>
6, etc.  I would answer &quot;no&quot; to all of these for the same reason.
<br>
Being tortured would upset me... I wouldn't want anyone to do it to
<br>
me, and I wouldn't want to do it to anyone else (including my
<br>
&quot;original&quot; future self) regardless of how many copies of me were made
<br>
and when.
<br>
<p>Jeff
