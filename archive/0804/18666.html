<em>&gt;  The primary difference is fidelity of replication, which limits complexity.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;  that they are heritable, must have a complexity of less than 100 bits.
</em><br>
<p><p>Much better phrased than me! I had a post that I sent to SL4 on this
<br>
issue, but it kept getting rejected. I'll try and send it again, in
<br>
case (as there are other differences between memes and genes that
<br>
should be noted):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; the analogy between memes and genes is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; interesting, linguistically, but in practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; they are completely different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  No, Memes and Genes are not completely different, they are not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  substantially different. It's true that they run on different operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  systems, one on proteins and the other on a brain, but both are units of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  information that can be transferred from one generation to the next.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in that sense they are the same. But in most ways they are
<br>
substantially different! A gene is an object that can make only a
<br>
small number of discrete changes, comes bundled in a clearly defined
<br>
being (an animal body), is only passed on through one definite process
<br>
(reproduction), is nearly entierly dependent on its interaction with
<br>
other genes, and can be entirely eliminated.
<br>
<p>A meme can make many continuous changes, is not bundled in any strict
<br>
structure (notice how post-modernist anti-capitalist ideas have slid
<br>
into the market system), is passed on in many different ways, at many
<br>
different times, is less dependent on its intereaction with all the
<br>
other memes out there (consider deleting 10% of the memes in the world
<br>
versus deleting 10% of the genes in a body), and gets entierly
<br>
eliminated only very, very rarely.
<br>
<p>(this is a somewhat simplified view of memes and genes, but should be
<br>
enough to emphasis the differences).
<br>
<p>So yes, there are analogies between genes and memes, but they are
<br>
sufficiently different that we cannot take genetic evolution, and
<br>
expect it to be comparable to memetic evolution.
