<em>&gt; It is interesting, then, that advocates of national health care don't try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start businesses operated like the European health care cartels, but instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demand government intervention.
</em><br>
<p>Not really on topic, but I can't let that pass - the theory behind
<br>
publicly funded healthcare is precisely that it is universal, and
<br>
obligatory (hence needs the coercive power of a state). This (in
<br>
theory) reduces administrative costs (as there is no need to
<br>
discriminate between users) and improves outcomes (as consumers are
<br>
very poor judges of whether they received good medical care, compared
<br>
with most other domains; hence specialists make better decisions than
<br>
private individuals). That's the theory, anyway.
<br>
<p>So challenging someone to set up a private version of national
<br>
healthcare is, sorry to say it, dumb.
<br>
<p>But are national healthcares better or worst that private versions?
<br>
Well, that's an empirical question, not a theoretical one. Cross
<br>
country comparaisons are notoriously weak statistical tools, but
<br>
they're the best we have in this debate. And the data seems to imply
<br>
that national healthcares are better, or cheaper, or both, that purely
<br>
private healthcare. Of course, there is a range of heathcare varieties
<br>
within national systems, with different private participation and with
<br>
different results (ex: the NHS, the epitome of purely public
<br>
healthcare, is only morderately good, but is very cheap. France's
<br>
system, with greater private participation, is of higher quality,
<br>
though I believe (but can't find the figures) that it is more
<br>
expensive than the NHS, though a lot cheaper than the american model).
<br>
<p><p>And one last question: what does all this have to do with the singularity?
<br>
<p>Stuart
