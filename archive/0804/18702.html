<br>
<em>&gt;Sort of without formalism.  If you respect individual intelligent beings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at all you in some sense respect a core of private property, the beings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own self and right to exist.  
</em><br>
<p>If I understand you right, this does not include my CD (that is,
<br>
music) collection, since that has essentially no connection to my self
<br>
or right to exist.  I agree that my self and right to exist are good
<br>
things to preserve, and likewise yours too.  However, the normal
<br>
meaning of property rights seems to imply that I get to keep my CD
<br>
collection unless I voluntarily transfer it elsewhere, but I don't see
<br>
how your argument is getting there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Given that much some modicum of property is essential to existence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least some amount of space, shelter, energy, food and so on.
</em><br>
<p>I thought property rights meant that if you made enough bad trades, or
<br>
you start out from a bad-enough position, you could find yourself
<br>
without food or a way to get food because all the food is property of
<br>
someone else, so you starve to death.  You seem to be saying that
<br>
respecting people implies making sure they don't starve to death.  I
<br>
tend to agree with you (except I would call it compassion, but that
<br>
difference isn't essential here), but that's not what I understood
<br>
property rights to mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Given that we are talking about an intelligent being part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respect is for the being to do its own thinking, act on its thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and experience consequences (learn).
</em><br>
<p>So far so good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Out of freedom to act and experience consequence comes freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;association with others ...  
</em><br>
<p>I'm still following you...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...and freedom to make voluntary agreements/exchanges (trade).
</em><br>
<p>...and I lost you there.  The only property rights you mentioned so
<br>
far are the ones essential to my survival, so how do you get from
<br>
there to rationalizing the assertion that I own my CD collection and
<br>
it shouldn't be transferred to someone else without my consent?
<br>
<p>Let's have a pair of concrete scenarios.
<br>
<p>Scenario A: I'm sitting in a restaurant eating a meal.  There's a
<br>
hungry guy sitting outside.  Property rights seems to say that if I
<br>
pay for my meal, I get to eat it, and a powerful AI that supports
<br>
property rights won't transfer the meal to the hungry guy no matter
<br>
how hungry he is.
<br>
<p>Scenario B: There's a hungry guy who owns a meal he is about to eat.
<br>
He's distracted and I steal the meal from him and eat it.  If the AI
<br>
supports property rights, presumably the AI should have stopped me.
<br>
<p>The difference between these scenarios is who owns the meal.  How can
<br>
we specify an algorithm that looks at the history leading up to these
<br>
points and computes who owns what?
<br>
<p>Do we want the AI to respect property rights, or do we want the AI to
<br>
be willing to feed the hungry guy if he's hungry enough, nevermind the
<br>
property rights?
<br>
