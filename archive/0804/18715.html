<p><p><p><em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>See thats the issue that I have with it-- what do we want to consider as
<br>
part of you right this moment? Firstly we have an autonomic nervous system
<br>
that we are completely unaware of-- is that part of you? What about your own
<br>
memories, some of which are not consciously accessible right now? What if I
<br>
were to create a neural implant that vastly improved the rate at which I
<br>
could exchange information with the outside world, connect to a series of
<br>
other computers, or individuals with similar implants. What consequence does
<br>
this have for my own individuality? (I dont know)
<br>
<p>Secondly, when we think about something, we dont perform the calculation
<br>
instantly, and every region of our brain is not in instant communication
<br>
with every other region. I dont know that we understand the human cognitive
<br>
architecture well enough to even say what part of the brain firing at any
<br>
given moment correlates with the experience of thinking. We dont know that
<br>
every neuron contributes equally to the conscious experience, or even if
<br>
what neurons *do* contribute to the experience of thinking at point in time
<br>
t are the same neurons that contribute to the experience of thinking at t +
<br>
x.
<br>
<p>Lets assume that we have a solar system brain that is massively parallel in
<br>
a way analogous to our own brains. Is it so inconceivable to have a scenario
<br>
whereby the cognitive experience is 'slowed down'?   Lets say that the time
<br>
it takes an electrical signal to propagate across my cognitive apparatus is
<br>
T. Lets also say that a given 'thought' consists of n iterations of a neural
<br>
cascade, i.e. taking n * T time. Well in a solar system brain, T is simply a
<br>
lot larger of a value, but to the brain itself, does it make sense to say
<br>
that the fundamental experience of that thought is any different? It seems
<br>
to be just as valid to say that, subjectively speaking, to the solar system
<br>
brain, time simply passes by at a different rate.
<br>
<p>If we compare our brains to the cluster of nerves in insects for example--
<br>
do we have a less coherent experience since a neural signal takes longer to
<br>
propagate across our cognitive apparatus than it does theirs?
<br>
<p>You say that &quot;individual sentience is limited in size&quot; -- well imagine we
<br>
create a solar system computer. Does it then just spontaneously generate a
<br>
myriad smaller 'sentiences' within it? where does one begin and the next one
<br>
end?
<br>
<p>If you feel uneasy about talking about subjective experience (I do, it makes
<br>
too many assumptions) we can still just talk about a solar-system sized
<br>
computer, and how efficiently it processes. I dont see any reason why size
<br>
would become a significant barrier. It would of course have a minimum amount
<br>
of time that it would take to perform a calculation (the same is true of our
<br>
own brains) but the sheer degree of parallel computing power would likely
<br>
override the speed of light constraint in terms of efficiency of
<br>
computation.
