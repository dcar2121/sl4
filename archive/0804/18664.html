2008/4/25 Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@rawbw.com?Subject=Re:%20Unbounded%20happiness">lcorbin@rawbw.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It makes sense that trees don't suffer when you chop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  them down, *because they can't do anything about it*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  A mammal, on the other hand, has all sorts of reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to suffer.  For one, it's nature's way of telling him that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  he must extricate himself from this situation, no matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  what. For another, nature is telling him &quot;never, never,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  never forget how you got into this, stupid&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's why pain would evolve in some species but not others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  So I proceed to refute my own long held position
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  thusly:  let's suppose that to get out of some horribly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  painful situation, the subject must solve a puzzle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Isn't it rather likely---at least from the depictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I've seen on TV---that people can hurt so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that they can't think clearly?  In some hideous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  experiment (well, the Nazis were helpful in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  small, unfortunate way), the mean time of unlocking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a puzzle chain could be measured as a function of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  pain. Indeed, there might be a minimum:  up to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  certain threshold, the victim/subject doesn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bother with solving the puzzle, or puts it off. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a certain higher threshold he hurries as fast as he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can. Then isn't there also a point where his performance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  tanks as the pain becomes blinding?  I think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Therefore, a Darwinian analysis suggests that elephants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  might suffer pain as much or more than do humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Hmm, can this be right? Of course if your KC analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is right, we still win the sensitivity contest.
</em><br>
<p>Another reason why evolution might make the maximal pain intensity of
<br>
more intelligent animals like humans lower than that of less
<br>
intelligent animals is that humans have foresight. There are
<br>
situations where it appears that suffering pain in the short term may
<br>
have long term benefits, so those individuals which don't find the
<br>
pain completely unbearable in these situations will be at an
<br>
advantage.
<br>
<p>But these considerations of why differing experiences of pain might
<br>
evolve does not answer the question of what determines maximal pain
<br>
intensity. A mouse may have fewer neurons firing when its foot is put
<br>
on hotplate than a human does, but what reason is there to assume that
<br>
the mouse experiences the same amount of pain *per neuron* as a human?
