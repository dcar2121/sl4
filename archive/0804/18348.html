</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but you had asked whether someone with read-only memory
<br>
is conscious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What we call &quot;conscious experience&quot; is a recallable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuous time sequence of perceived events, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions and thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. If what you say were true, then after an
<br>
agreed upon conscious experience, we could render
<br>
the experience not conscious, it looks like, by 
<br>
surgically removing the memories acquired during
<br>
that time. To me, whether or not an experience
<br>
is conscious, is not connected with whether later
<br>
it can be remembered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider the case of Homer without a hippocampus who is able to recall the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iliad word for word (which he learned before his surgery) but has no short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term memory.  He will not remember anything that happened after his surgery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and will not form any new memories.  After reciting the Iliad he will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember that he had just done so.  Is he conscious?
</em><br>
<p>To me, he was indeed conscious during the recitation. 
<br>
I consider memory acquisition to be separate, probably
<br>
because of our computer metaphor, in which it's easy
<br>
to have a program suddenly begin to fail to write out
<br>
its transaction logs, say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; If you define consciousness as a sequence S
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; of algorithmically similar states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; (K(S_n+1|S_n) = O(1)) then certainly it exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; First, I don't define consciousness as a sequence of states,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; similar or not. You could aim your question at Stathis, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; example. Moreover, I don't follow your mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; notation at all.  Is the O supposed to be Landau's &quot;big-oh&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; notation?  (I gather that K is Kolmogorov complexity, though.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is what I meant.  But choose your own definition if you prefer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we could agree on a definition then the rest would be easy.
</em><br>
<p>I'm pretty leery of definitions (Korzybski explained very well 
<br>
how easy it is for Aristotelian definitions to be useless or
<br>
even dangerous), but I would say that consciousness is
<br>
the process whereby a program or operating brain reports
<br>
upon its own substates to itself, and is then able to distinguish
<br>
these reports from the substates, (informally, &quot;so that they can
<br>
be 'though about'&quot;.) I mean by &quot;substate&quot; a particular sense
<br>
organ's state or a report of a sense organ's state or a recall
<br>
of some memory, all of which is recursive, so that a report
<br>
of a report may be also considered to be a substate.)
<br>
<p>This is admittedly pretty rough, but I've heard people say much
<br>
the same thing, and it sounded right to me.
