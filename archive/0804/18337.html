<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Suppose you have a 3 way Turing test between a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; human, a GLUT, and a human whose memory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; set to read-only at the start of the test
</em><br>
<p>I guess I didn't understand that part. I thought that
<br>
you meant that for the duration of a test, e.g. between
<br>
times t1 and t2, no *new* memories may be acquired.
<br>
That sure *sounds* like what you meant!  No?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; (of equivalently, whose mental state is reset after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; each question).  Is the read-only human conscious?
</em><br>
<p>So I responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Of course the read-only human is conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Suppose it's only Homer, and he's only reciting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the Iliad around a campfire. We adjust his nervous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; system so that *during the narration*, on which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; he is totally focused, neither the campfire, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; any of the sounds, nor any other of his senses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are leaving any record whatsoever in his memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (Naturally we have to idealize this a bit in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to address, in principle, the answer to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; idealized &quot;read-only human&quot; question.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is not the same.  He will still remember remembering.
</em><br>
<p>Your brief reply fails to specify where my example goes
<br>
wrong. *During the test*, while Homer is reading, he is
<br>
of course recalling his past life (he has to, for among other
<br>
reasons, to be able to recite the Iliad). But he is forming
<br>
no *new* memories, nor is he going to be able later to
<br>
remember remembering, where the latter &quot;remembering&quot;
<br>
specifies a process occuring between t1 and t2. That
<br>
remembering did indeed happen, but later he won't
<br>
remember that it did.
<br>
<p>In fact, during the narration he doesn't happen to recall that
<br>
a moment earlier he had said such and such---by my
<br>
stipulation, he is able nonetheless to recite the whole thing
<br>
the same way that you, while reciting the alphabet, do not
<br>
remember (unless you try) reciting the letter 'C' when you
<br>
have got to 'Q'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It may be easy for some to say that there is no such thing as consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but someday we'll have much more thorough characterizations of it than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; we do now, and the argument that they're wrong will be all the more solid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you define consciousness as a sequence S of algorithmically similar states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (K(S_n+1|S_n) = O(1)) then certainly it exists.
</em><br>
<p>First, I don't define consciousness as a sequence of states,
<br>
similar or not. You could aim your question at Stathis, for
<br>
example. Moreover, I don't follow your mathematical
<br>
notation at all.  Is the O supposed to be Landau's &quot;big-oh&quot;
<br>
notation?  (I gather that K is Kolmogorov complexity, though.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; In the meantime, you can choose to believe that the Alien itself and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; many copies were no more conscious while they were answering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 26^10000 possible questions, than is the relatively simple little lookup
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; device they left behind.  If so, then you're quite wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are not functionally equivalent.  The Alien has episodic memory and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GLUT does not.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree. Even though both the Alien easily passes the Turing Test,
<br>
and we have to affirm his intelligence, so we are also tricked into believing
<br>
that the Giant LookUp Table has passed, since we are not given the
<br>
fact that it's only a recording of innumerable efforts on the part of the
<br>
Alien.
