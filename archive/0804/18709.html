<p>
William and Krekoski have a problem with my
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2008/4/25 Lee Corbin &lt;<a href="mailto:lcorbin@rawbw.com?Subject=Re:%20Unbounded%20happiness">lcorbin@rawbw.com</a>&gt;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  The speed of light limits how big an &quot;individual&quot; can be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  If it conducts thoughts at the speed of light, then is the .1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  second or so delay across the world still okay for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  a single mind? 
</em><br>
<p>and point out that if the thinking is slow enough, then it
<br>
the size may be arbitrarily large.
<br>
<p>True enough, but that rather defeats the whole point of
<br>
using resources effectively. There would be utterly no
<br>
point in using an entire solar system's resources to emulate
<br>
my mind, making that possible only by having it think very,
<br>
very slowly. 
<br>
<p>To ward off misunderstanding, let me be more specific.
<br>
Let k be the ratio of c, the speed of light, to n, the speed
<br>
of neural conduction in my brain. Then clearly a very 
<br>
large brain could be built of size s*k, where s is the
<br>
present size of my brain, but would conduct neural
<br>
information at c. To what point?
<br>
<p>Krekoski goes on
<br>
<p><em>&gt; let's not confuse intuitions about consciousness with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computability. There seems to be no real reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aside from energy requirements and heat why a machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't be any arbitrary size and still perform computations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that take advantage of increase in complexity. You would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly eventually get diminishing returns, but consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the speed of neurons in our brain is significantly slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than light, i.e. there is delay, and it doesn't seem to be an issue. 
</em><br>
<p>While I'm not sure I understand every word of that, it's it clear
<br>
that if my neurons *did* operate at c, then I'd be thinking a lot
<br>
faster?  Bottom line: large brains should have no reason to
<br>
choose to operate slowly, so therefore thought will be conducted
<br>
at c, and therefore what an &quot;individual sentience&quot; is will be limited
<br>
in size.  Now yes, I can even now perform &quot;library inquiries&quot;, or
<br>
get an answer to a math problem by letting my computer run
<br>
long enough, but in neither case is the library or my computer to
<br>
be considered part of me. 
<br>
<p>Lee
