<p>Sorry for a confusing comment. I now read the comment thread to
<br>
Pascal's mugging post, and can concisely state my argument: I believe
<br>
that a stable goal system requires scope insensitivity, at least in
<br>
some cases.
<br>
<p>Probabilities can in a way be used instead of utility, to avoid
<br>
utility vs. probability dichotomy. That is, if decision-making
<br>
(action) is described as a probabilistic process, probabilities that
<br>
describe decision-making can be interpreted as defining utility.
<br>
Utility isn't explicitly used in this case. I prefer this view in
<br>
context of AI, because it enables unsupervised learning of utility
<br>
with the same flexibility as action and perception, without additional
<br>
explicit mechanism for it.
<br>
<p>When action is considered as perception seen from another point of
<br>
view, it can be said that utilities also follow from probabilities
<br>
used for perception. It only changes facts for which probabilities are
<br>
estimated: roughly speaking, instead of negative utility attached to
<br>
'people will be hurt', system estimates probability of 'I will try to
<br>
oppose it', given that 'people will be hurt'.
<br>
<p>If you have infinite amount of evidence and infinite resources, your
<br>
priors can be almost arbitrary, and you'll still approximate correct
<br>
distribution sooner or later (given that they are defined on strings,
<br>
so they can't be just all equal to each other). When priors on strings
<br>
are selected, some of hypotheses will get a larger chunk of
<br>
probability mass, and some will have to deal with tiny initial
<br>
probabilities. As learning progresses, presented evidence updates
<br>
probabilities, so that some of tiny probabilities can grow. With
<br>
limited amount of evidence, it's a good heuristics to worry more about
<br>
probabilities of hypotheses important for utility, so that they will
<br>
be spotted earlier, as in this case some of these probabilities
<br>
determine action. If prior probability is too low, it can take too
<br>
long to raise it to a level when it can be acted upon.
<br>
<p>This reformulation makes me skeptical about additivity of utility: if
<br>
utility initially comes from probability of action choice, it's
<br>
reasonable that increasing frequency of positive (action-reinforcing)
<br>
experiences will increase resulting utility to some extent, but going
<br>
linearly all the way is too much: there are other causes for action
<br>
and other drives. Self-improvement (learning) needs to extrapolate a
<br>
current hegdopodge of drives 'simultaneously'. Of course if we are
<br>
talking about an alien utilitarian AI with unstable goal system, the
<br>
conclusion that it can be mugged might as well be correct. So, our
<br>
mugger will still need to present lots of evidence in order to change
<br>
action probability, even though stakes are seemingly insane. It's not
<br>
a generally valid argument, as in some cases self-improvement can
<br>
adjust system's probabilities independently of external evidence,
<br>
trying to better grasp intended goal system from current
<br>
implementation.
