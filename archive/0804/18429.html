<p><em>&gt; But we don't allow some people to be tortured just because &quot;on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average&quot;, everyone will come out ahead. Similarly, I think we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put an ethical lower limit on the degree of suffering any copy could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put up with, rather than just trying to maximise the sum over the good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; runtimes and the bad.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think that that is called &quot;negative utilitarianism&quot;. 
<br>
I follow David Pearce mostly in such matters
<br>
(www.hedweb.com) and his great essay &quot;The
<br>
Hedonistic Imperative&quot;.  I first studied that ten
<br>
years ago.
<br>
<p>Now he has a new essay at www.superhappiness.com
<br>
(though I may have picked that up from someone on
<br>
SL4 or Extropians).
<br>
<p>He too is (if I'm not messing up the terms) a
<br>
&quot;negative utilitarian&quot;.  Anyway, the notion is
<br>
described in the first few pages of his new essay
<br>
if not in the old.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that there is only one way of deciding
<br>
the issue that I would be content with. Suppose that
<br>
N is a very negative experience, P is a very positive
<br>
experience, and A is an experience that I'm basically
<br>
indifferent to.  Suppose I undergo N+P  or P+N.
<br>
If I find that I prefer that to A+A, then I guess that
<br>
it doesn't make sense *to me* to be a &quot;negative
<br>
utilitarian&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Our big problem is that while it is very easy to cause
<br>
a human unbelievable agony, it is very hard to cause
<br>
one unbelievable exstacy (though Dave does a pretty
<br>
good job of trying). So perhaps the negative utilitarians
<br>
are letting their greater ability to imagine dire events
<br>
outweigh their (so far) limited ability to imagine absolutely
<br>
wonderful effects.
<br>
<p>Now---as far as ethics *between* separate people, 
<br>
and out of fairness no person ought to be permitted
<br>
to undergo vast suffering in order to benefit others,
<br>
I may agree.  It's just to me a value judgment, however,
<br>
and although I despise some people's value systems,
<br>
the choice you suggest is very agreeable to me.
<br>
<p>Lee
