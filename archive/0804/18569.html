<em>&gt;  &gt;  Schematically:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  1) The decision is made by the programmers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  2) The decision is made by a small group of people with their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  interest in mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  3) The decision is made by a small group of altruistic people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  4) The decision is made by some sort of democratic process, strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  guided by those with a good understanding of the issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  5) The decision is made by some sort of pure democratic process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extrapolated volition? (In which the initial dynamic comes from (3),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and the end result from something like (4) or (5) but without at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  some of democracy's flaws.)
</em><br>
<p>I'm sceptical about the whole extrapolated volition concept. My
<br>
objections are properly written up in
<br>
<a href="http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf">http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>But to paraphrase: even those advocating extrapolated volition
<br>
acknowledge that there could be problems (and sometimes allow a &quot;final
<br>
judge&quot; to check up specific things, like whether the extinction of
<br>
humanity is on the cards). But if EV can go &quot;wrong&quot; in one way, it
<br>
could go wrong in many ways - ways we may not even conceive of now,
<br>
but if we were told about, we would say &quot;that's nearly as bad as going
<br>
extinct!&quot;. So EV has to be throughly checked before being implemented
<br>
as a moral basis; a final judge with one or two specific isn't enough.
<br>
So we haven't gained anything. Decisions still have to be made. How?
<br>
