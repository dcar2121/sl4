<em>&gt; &gt;In Causal Decision Theory, this is true. However, it's possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;adopt a different decision theory that is specifically designed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;less exploitable, without having to give up the things that you care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What things are we talking about giving up here?
</em><br>
<p>Never mind, I thought you were advocating that we not care about
<br>
people outside the fixed set, when what you're recommending is that we
<br>
should still care, but in some way that's expressed outside the
<br>
utility function. This is still a bad idea in my opinion, but there's
<br>
already a lot of research and debate on &quot;why we want utility functions
<br>
the first place&quot; and I have no personal new insights beyond those that
<br>
have already been made (at least none that can be described in words
<br>
rather than vague intuitions inside my head about complexity spaces)
<br>
so I won't elaborate further.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you care to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  describe the different decision theory you have in mind?
</em><br>
<p>No, I would rather you figure out on your own what sorts of decision
<br>
theories would partially solve these problems. I advocate this either
<br>
because you'll gain more insight if you figure it out on your own, or
<br>
because I'm too lazy to explain it myself today (you have no way of
<br>
knowing which is the truth).
