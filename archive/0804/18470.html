</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What the heck does &quot;love&quot; mean if it does not mean that I esteem the

<em>&gt; person I love more than random other persons that I may not even know?   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And why would I say such a thing? 
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  Sorry, but I was addressing someone else's POV.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Well, as you know, some people wish to degrade
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; others for sexual gratification. There are probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; other people who you and I would equally condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; who might wish to degrade others in various ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That is the point.  To these people, it may in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be very convenient that the victim remembers nothing.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; That it is convenient to some types of molesters makes what point exactly? 
</em><br>
<p>The point was that damage or harm was done, regardless of
<br>
memory retention.  The quality of someone's overall life went
<br>
down as a result of the action taken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I mean a great deal more than that.  To force the will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; of another intelligent being in such a brutish fashion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; makes one obviously unfit for society. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That's a claim that depends on your particular society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In some societies, exactly the reverse made people unfit.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what.  I am not talking about what some &quot;society&quot; held.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am talking about [or trying to] what is and is not conducive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to humans living together well. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Recall the Viking who refused to pinion English
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; babies on the end of his sword and swing them about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The other Vikings thought this very strange, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; probably lessened his status among them. But I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that I agree totally with the general sentiment of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you are saying.   But very objectively speaking, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; comes down to little more than you and I and almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everyone in our society today disapproving most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; strenuously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  Your &quot;conducive to humans living together well&quot; is highly
<br>
culturally dependent.
<br>
