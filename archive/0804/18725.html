<em>&gt;  If I was the AGI (and though more or less like I do today) and was charged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the ultimate well-being of all sentients then my solution would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1) upload all sentients into worlds identical to their current worlds or of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their choice for more evolved sentients;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  2) by design all sentients have up to the moment back-ups;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  3) let them live by whatever rules (or defaults from their previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions) that they choose;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  4) if they off themselves or 'die' or come to serious injury they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinstate but likely without much memory of what came before but loaded up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with issues to work through from before;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  5) churn so each sentient becomes more and more enlightened / reaches its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest potential at its own pace;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  6) interfere only as judiciously and minimally as possible to avoid forcing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outcome to something other than what the sentient would ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  In short a full VR multiverse with perfect reincarnation overseen by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully benevolent God/Mind.     Otherwise I think universal or perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness is a rather nasty farce.
</em><br>
<p>I like your formulation - it's clear, and interesting, and maybe even likely.
<br>
<p>But we still have to solve the friendliness problem long before we
<br>
begin to worry about the details of that uploaded world...
<br>
