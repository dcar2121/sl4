<p>
Something like Pascal's Mugging (
<br>
<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/pascals-mugging.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/10/pascals-mugging.html</a> ) is a
<br>
problem even without someone trying to mug you. It may be that there
<br>
is some way (say, a magic button hidden in the middle of the Boötes
<br>
Void, hence the title) to allow 3^^^^3 (or any other very large but
<br>
low-algorithmic-complexity number) times as many happy posthumans to
<br>
exist than could ever exist in the universe without 'magic' - or, more
<br>
generally, for most utility functions there may exist 'magic' to
<br>
create much much more utility than would otherwise be possible. This
<br>
is extremely unlikely, but it seems doubtful that it would be unlikely
<br>
enough to have lower expected utility than the default course. This
<br>
suggests that devoting massive resources to searching for magic is a
<br>
convergent subgoal for any utility maximizer whose utility function
<br>
admits of Really Big Numbers, and that even a Friendly AI, if it fit
<br>
that description, would do so, possibly even to the exclusion of
<br>
supporting existing humans, or at least diverting a majority of the
<br>
resources that could go to existing humans.
<br>
<p>So is this really the Friendly thing to do? The resolution of Pascal's
<br>
Mugging, on OB, was that &quot;states with many people hurt have a low
<br>
correlation with what any random person claims to be able to effect&quot;
<br>
(Robin Hanson's words); this doesn't seem to apply because there is no
<br>
mugger, the FAI itself is presumably in a different observer class
<br>
than (post)humans, and the 'magic' might take the form of creating a
<br>
relatively small number of extremely valuable posthumans. Because
<br>
there is no mugger, arguments about creating incentives for others to
<br>
mug you don't work.
<br>
<p>If the Friendly utility function is bounded, that would very likely
<br>
solve the problem. This violently disagrees with my ethical intuition,
<br>
but I now take it much more seriously than I did before. Ignoring
<br>
miniscule probabilities would also solve the problem, but throws
<br>
rational consequentalism out the window. Is there some other reason
<br>
this isn't the Friendly thing to do, or do I just think it's wrong
<br>
because I don't want to die or be restricted because of a bet on odds
<br>
too long to comprehend?
