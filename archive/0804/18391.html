</em><br>
<p>Reasoning based on knowledge of what the teleporter does and some
<br>
reasonable assumptions about philosophy of mind is faith?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Faith says that you are going to step into a booth and be crushed with 100%
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  money.
</em><br>
<p>How do you know what *I* would do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If you prefer, think of teleportation as equivalent to being tortured and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  having the memory of the torture erased.  This has zero utility to a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agent because there is no change in mental state.
</em><br>
<p>I can't care about things I won't remember? Then I can't care about
<br>
anything, because I won't remember anything when I'm dead.
