<em>&gt; If that were so, then over decades they would become a lot poorer than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries with freer economic systems. That obviously hasn't happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If and only if that were the only difference. As I noted, they have a very
<br>
high-quality work force. It's no accident that American firms work very hard
<br>
to hire people from Germany, China, Russia, France, etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Well, this is the point. Unfettered capitalism does not necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build human capital. If it did what would be the point in taxing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to provide free education and so on?
</em><br>
<p><p>Are you claiming that capitalism must not provide for education, else why
<br>
would people tax capitalists to provide it? I usually try to go for higher
<br>
standards of proof than &quot;People act as if it were so.&quot; I would also note
<br>
that if you stroll around the average American campus, you will find lots of
<br>
buildings named after Stanford and Tepper and Brown and Yale -- all rich
<br>
capitalists who gave millions to start colleges. Perhaps I haven't traveled
<br>
enough to see 'Taxpayer hall' and 'voter for proposition authorizing bond
<br>
issue earmarked for education memorial cafeteria'.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The point of a public health system is not that it is paid for by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxes but that it efficiently provides excellent health care for all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country's citizens, and there would only be a handful of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievements that are as important as that.
</em><br>
<p><p>It is interesting, then, that advocates of national health care don't try to
<br>
start businesses operated like the European health care cartels, but instead
<br>
demand government intervention. If that is the unimportant part, why do they
<br>
spend all their time on it and not on what you claim is the important part?
<br>
Your theories introduce a lot of confusion, but they don't seem to have much
<br>
explanatory power. Elaboration is in order.
