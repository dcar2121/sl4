<p><em>&gt; From: Jeff Herrlich &lt;<a href="mailto:jeff_herrlich@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Can't%20afford%20to%20rescue%20cows">jeff_herrlich@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Why not make the beneficiaries all sentient/conscious beings? The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;evolutionarily designed aspect of selfishness, may be a bit of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;problem. [Not that I'm beyond selfishness, on occassion -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;unfortunately].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But on to &quot;sentient/conscious&quot;... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The dictionary I looked at defined &quot;sentient&quot; to mean &quot;conscious&quot;, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's only one word there to wonder about.  I'm not sure I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of &quot;conscious&quot; that I'd be willing to try to implement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But nevermind that, I'm too conflict-averse to make the attempt.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhists say cows (and other mammals) are conscious.  If humans eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cows, and my AI is influenced more by empathy for sentient beings than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by respect for cow butcherers, it will try to stop the cows from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eaten.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so!  Out of concern for the cows, the AI will continue
<br>
to promote human raising of cattle. The AI we hope for will merely
<br>
stipulate (as we should) that the cows lead pleasant lives and that
<br>
when their lives come to an end it's quick and painless. Better to
<br>
have lived a mostly pleasant life than to have never lived at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So trying  to save the cows would make the AI (and its implementor)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; targets for no political benefit.
</em><br>
<p>I'd read it this way:  even if the AI has concern for cows, and wants
<br>
them to go on being bred, I hope that it will allow humans to just
<br>
grow the tissue directly, without concurrent cow experience. 
<br>
<p>Since the cows belong to the humans, the humans ought to be left
<br>
alone in the case that they're not hurting anyone (e.g. the cows).
<br>
