</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But things &quot;happen&quot; in a timeless block universe as well. The fact
<br>
that time seems to flow is not evidence against a block universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if the whole universe is actually a simulation
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of simple life etc. have much higher measure than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; those giving rise to a disembodied consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You evidently do believe that our whole universe (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  level one Tegmark infinite universe) is a &quot;simulation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Platonia&quot;, and the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  physics -&gt; Big Bang -&gt; stars -&gt; planets -&gt; evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is much more important in emulating you than would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be non-temporal (timeless) patterns exhibited here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and there randomly in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's the way the simulation appears to have turned out. An
<br>
interesting question to ask is, what is the point of simulating the
<br>
intricate workings of my brain? It might seem computationally more
<br>
efficient to make my head solid like a potato, at least until the
<br>
point in the simulation when someone takes a look inside. However,
<br>
there is no reason to postulate a godlike programmer interested in
<br>
simulating humans. The only starting premise is that all possible
<br>
computations are necessarily implemented in Platonia. This leads to a
<br>
virtual multiverse, and the problem becomes to show that I am more
<br>
likely to find myself conscious as a result of the playing out of the
<br>
laws of physics as we know them than as an elaborate, as if hand-coded
<br>
simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Given any apparently random structure or process, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exists in the possibility space of alien semantics a printout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which gives it any particular meaning. Now, while it is true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that if we had the appropriate printout, the vibrations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atoms in a rock could be seen to spell out the King James
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bible, or simulate tomorrow's weather in Tokyo, it is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of trivial interest, because we don't have that printout.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  And it wouldn't matter if we did happen to?  After all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that would only represent some work on the part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a probably long-ago dead Alien civilization which had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  read meaning into a process where it would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  possible to read any meaning into it whatsoever.  Oh, but then perhaps I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  have got you wrong:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But if we consider that the rock is implementing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computations which lead to conscious observers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this is of greater interest; for there is no reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why the consciousness of the observers should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be contingent on whether we have the printout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes, but how likely do you consider it to be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  any given rock (for the sake of concreteness, weighing on Earth about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  same as a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  being) is actually implementing conscious beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  with measure that is at least a significant fraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the computation that your body or mine is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  implementing to give us experience?
</em><br>
<p>You have to distinguish between the computer and the computed. Most of
<br>
the computations underpinning your consciousness are of a form that
<br>
makes it seem as if your mind is generated by your brain. But your
<br>
mind, your brain and the rocks are all actually part of the grand
<br>
simulation in Platonia. Within this simulation we could take any
<br>
particular object, such as a rock, and consider that it is
<br>
implementing any computation at all, including computations that give
<br>
rise to your consciousness. However, these computations don't change
<br>
anything.
<br>
<p>For the sake of concreteness, let's say that 1% of the computations in
<br>
Platonia give rise to processes in which you find yourself a
<br>
conscious, biological being. Then 1% of the computations being
<br>
implemented by a rock will also give rise to the same computations,
<br>
since there is no basis for saying that the mix of rock computations
<br>
will be any different from the general mix of computations in
<br>
Platonia. Thus, you don't gain or lose anything by creating or
<br>
destroying the rock. On the other hand, if you create a copy of
<br>
yourself, that would mean that 2% of the computations in Platonia are
<br>
now giving rise to processes in which you find yourself a conscious
<br>
being, biological or cybernetic, as the case may be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And following up that question, surely the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mass of the Earth's iron core must implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you or me to such a tremendous extent that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  present metabolisms are relatively of almost zero significance?
</em><br>
<p>If any physical process can map onto any computation, then the one
<br>
process can map onto an infinity of parallel computations. The main
<br>
interesting consequence of this idea, as I keep stressing, is to show
<br>
that all computations are necessarily implemented by virtue of their
<br>
status as Platonic objects. You don't make a difference to the measure
<br>
of Platonic objects by counting the kilograms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thus, all possible computations are implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by mapping onto any physical process. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structure is mostly contained in the mapping,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but in the interesting case of computations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; containing observers, it is sufficient that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mapping merely exist in the abstract, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than as a hardcopy or even in the mind of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; external observer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If it is sufficient that these mappings exist in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  abstract---which as a mathematical platonist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I surely do agree with you that they do---then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  again, I don't quite follow what the significance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is of the fate of the particular Stathis organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as it presently runs in Australia is all about.
</em><br>
<p>If I die then that means the computations underpinning my
<br>
consciousness come to an end. However, I don't think I can die, since
<br>
there is always some possible multiverse future in which I continue to
<br>
have experiences, even if it is one of very low measure.
