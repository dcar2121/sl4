From: &quot;Nick Tarleton&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:nickptar@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Deception%20(was%20Re:%20What%20if%20there's%20an%20expiration%20date?)">nickptar@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;So the AI will see no problem with doing something that destroys the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world a day after expiration, provided it's helpful now and humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aren't aware of it (because the knowledge would make us suffer).
</em><br>
<p>Deceiving the humans with false beliefs is essential to losing that
<br>
way, and if the AI is motivated to deceive the humans then we have
<br>
problems even without an expiration date.  So the essential part of
<br>
this scenario is the deception, not the expiration date.  It's good to
<br>
check that existing spec [1] deals correctly with deception, since
<br>
that was the hardest part to get plausibly correct.  Here's how it
<br>
works:
<br>
<p>The AI explains the behavior of each human as maximizing that human's
<br>
estimated utility function.  
<br>
<p>It matters what the human believes, and humans may be mistaken, so
<br>
actually the AI explains each human's behavior as maximizing that
<br>
human's utility function, which is a function of that human's
<br>
estimated belief about the current state of the world.
<br>
<p>We certainly don't want to give the AI an incentive to lie, so the AI
<br>
optimizes for the human's utility function applied to the *AI's*
<br>
belief about the current state of the world.  (This is in contrast to
<br>
optimizing for the human's utility function applied to the human's
<br>
belief about the current state of the world, which would give the AI
<br>
an incentive to lie.)
<br>
<p>Any long term planning done by the humans is part of evaluating their
<br>
utility function.  So if we set aside scenarios where the AI is simply
<br>
mistaken about what's going on, the scenario you describe is possible
<br>
if the humans really don't care if the world is destroyed a day after
<br>
the end of the AI's planning horizon.  I don't think real humans want
<br>
that, so at least in this case, I think we're okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... a sharp cutoff is Not The Way. Even exponential discounting would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be superior, even though it has very implausible normative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implications:

<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/against-discoun.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/against-discoun.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the pointer.  I'm looking at it now but haven't read it
<br>
yet.  Can you point out a scenario where my sharp cutoff gives bad
<br>
results?
