<em>&gt;&gt; The two big large contributors to progress have been (i) Rule

<em>&gt;&gt; of Law (ii) Respect for Private Property.  These clearly apply

<em>&gt;&gt; only to humans. Cows, for example, cannot understand either,

<em>&gt;&gt; and they have no private property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt; This thread started when the need for a line to be drawn was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; realized. I've drawn that line in my previous post, and here I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; defend it. Questions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, here's a question -- Do you know a way to do something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hutter's AIXI that has the concept of respect for private property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built in?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Sort of without formalism.  If you respect individual intelligent beings 
<br>
at all you in some sense respect a core of private property, the beings 
<br>
own self and right to exist.  Given that much some modicum of property 
<br>
is essential to existence, at least some amount of space, shelter, 
<br>
energy, food and so on.  Given that we are talking about an intelligent 
<br>
being part of the respect is for the being to do its own thinking, act 
<br>
on its thinking and experience consequences (learn).  Out of freedom to 
<br>
act and experience consequence comes freedom of association with others 
<br>
and freedom to make voluntary agreements/exchanges (trade).   The rights 
<br>
to the products if any of such exchanges and interactions follow 
<br>
directly from the individual right to exist and function as a thinking 
<br>
being.
<br>
<p>I we surmise from the above that such freedom and property rights are 
<br>
essential to the maximal development of thinking beings and perhaps 
<br>
essential to the maximal creation of value among any collection of 
<br>
thinking beings then it follows that a FAI must support at least some 
<br>
naturally derivable level of property rights.
