<p>From: &quot;Rolf Nelson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rolf.h.d.nelson@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Bounded%20population%20(was%20Re:%20Bounded%20utility)">rolf.h.d.nelson@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;In Causal Decision Theory, this is true. However, it's possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adopt a different decision theory that is specifically designed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less exploitable, without having to give up the things that you care
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about.
</em><br>
<p>What things are we talking about giving up here?  Would you care to
<br>
describe the different decision theory you have in mind?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;1. Please give your alternative suggestion for a morality that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would actually endorse, and which is completely unexploitable.
</em><br>
<p>I don't get to decide the morality of any existing human, so the
<br>
remaining problem is to decide the morality of something that might be
<br>
constructed.  I don't care much what it does if there are no existing
<br>
humans any more, so it can take its values from observation of the
<br>
people it interacts with, and then it has to be trained to identify
<br>
them and figure out what they are doing and why they're doing it, blah
<br>
blah blah.  There are a few details there but no rocket science.
<br>
<p>My best documented idea at the moment is at
<br>
<a href="http://www.fungible.com/respect/index.html">http://www.fungible.com/respect/index.html</a>.  There was valid feedback
<br>
to it in a previous discussion here that is not yet in the document,
<br>
but it's not bad enough to need to be recalled.  It seems workable
<br>
unless it has bugs I don't know about.  (Check the known bugs section
<br>
for one significant bug I do know about.  It isn't pertinent to this
<br>
conversation.)
<br>
<p>We fix the set of people we care for, how much we care for them, the
<br>
time for the end of the plan, the maximum utility, the resolution of
<br>
the utility function, and maybe a few other parameters that slip my
<br>
mind at the moment.  When the time for the end of the plan comes, the
<br>
planner is complete.  It exits and unless the code is changed it won't
<br>
run any more.  Before the end of the plan, the people it's altruistic
<br>
toward will probably care what happens after the end of the plan, so
<br>
the planner will put the world in a state where the people can
<br>
reasonably expect good things to happen after the end of the plan.  It
<br>
will do this because it cares about them right now, and the people
<br>
care what happens after the end of the plan.  It won't do it because
<br>
it cares what happens after the end of the plan, since by construction
<br>
it doesn't care.
<br>
<p>For example, if people want it to run more, it is likely to arrange
<br>
for something similar to itself to be automatically instantiated and
<br>
start running with a new end-of-plan date and perhaps other changed
<br>
parameters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2. Is your overall goal to make the world a better place, or have you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elevated 'be unexploitable' to a supergoal rather than a means to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end?
</em><br>
<p>Being unexploitable is a means to an end.  It's a pretty important
<br>
means, since an exploitable, powerful AI is likely to be taken over by
<br>
someone I don't like.  Then his next plausible step is to squish me
<br>
like a bug, along with everyone else who might object to him running
<br>
the show.
