<br>
<p><em>&gt; We got on this point after a long tortuous route: so let's simplify!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S = a finite set of polynomials.
</em><br>
<p>I pretty much have to visualize everything, and probably don't
<br>
have your mathematical talent, so thanks for your patience :-)
<br>
Here I see (off to the left, actually) a finite set of polynomials
<br>
in mathematical platonia (Diagram 1)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; G = a GLUT on S.
</em><br>
<p>Here I see a giant lookup table whose entries actually are
<br>
elements of S. But I am maybe guessing at what &quot;on S&quot;
<br>
means. Anyway, I visualize this GLUT being at the center
<br>
of a whiteboard. (Diagram 2).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; R = a rule that says that any polynomial of n-th degree will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mapped, under G, to a polynomial of (n-1)-th degree.
</em><br>
<p>Now I would have thought that this rule existed between
<br>
elements of S: a mathematical-platonic rule analogous to
<br>
the rule that exists under the name differentiation, but 
<br>
vastly more complex (I presume). But you say that R
<br>
connects n-th degree polynomials *in G* (that is, as
<br>
table entries of the GLUT) to particular other polynomials
<br>
also in G. Well, I suppose that it amounts to the same
<br>
thing.  Okay. [ But it sounds a bit odd to refer to G as
<br>
a mapping, unless it was (incorrectly) taken to be a
<br>
mapping from platonia (Diagram 1) to the GLUT
<br>
(Diagram 2), where G(P) is the particular table entry
<br>
containing P. &lt;end incorrect interpretation&gt; ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; f = a hash function from S (to f(S))
</em><br>
<p>Back to Diagram 1 in my mental imagery. Right &quot;underneath&quot;
<br>
every polynomial in S written in a differently colored marker
<br>
is f(S), a string of apparent gibberish output by f.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; f(G) = the GLUT on f(S) equivalent to G on S.
</em><br>
<p>We may have here Diagram 3, (which I visualize as being
<br>
at the extreme right of a whiteboard) and which is very
<br>
analogous to Diagram 2 (the GLUT, as you say, &quot;on S&quot;).
<br>
Here too is a GLUT, but its entries are f(P) for each P in S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; f(R) = the rule on f(S) equivalent to R on S.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think I'm getting it. Just as R was a rule (see Diagram 2)
<br>
that connected polynomial entries in the first GLUT, e.g.
<br>
GLUTentry(P2) = R(GLUTentry(P1)), we now have in
<br>
Diagram 3
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GLUT2entry( f(P2) ) = f(R)(  GLUT2entry( f(P1) ) )
<br>
<p>where I may visualize P1 and P2 as being in S, f(P1) and f(P2)
<br>
being their &quot;shadows&quot; still in Diagram 1, and the two GLUT2
<br>
entries being connected by the new rule f(R) in Diagram 3.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Main point: G has very high KC (as does f(G)),
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what that means. (Ah, but see below.)
<br>
Perhaps you mean the rule R that functionally connects
<br>
two elements of G = GLUT1 has high KC?  I think I
<br>
know what the KC of a rule or a function would be.
<br>
<p>If so, that does seem a bit odd, since where I thought you
<br>
were going was to have here an analogy between consecutive
<br>
states of a conscious entity. But these latter are causally 
<br>
connected, hence, I believe have a low KC rule (e.g. Conway's
<br>
Life has quite a low KC rule connecting a generation to a 
<br>
subsequent generation). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; R has low KC, but f(R) has high KC.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, all right---that seems to make perfect sense. But I
<br>
guess I still don't know what &quot;G has very high KC&quot; means.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Theorem (which will be left as as exercise to the reader - i.e. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't calculated it, but it seems obvious):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; KC(f(R)) / KC(f(G)) can be made arbitrarily higher than KC(R) / KC(G) .
</em><br>
<p>Lost here.  I understand KC(R), but still don't grok KC(G),
<br>
likewise I understand KC(f(R)) but not KC(f(G)).
<br>
<p>I'll reply to the remainder here when I've understood better my
<br>
problems with the above.
<br>
<p>It all does continue to sound quite promising, though.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Corollary: We can decrease the KC of G to some extent, and still get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the inequality above. We want to do this, because we don't want G to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a full GLUT but something more &quot;understandable&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inspiration: If we imagine that G is the rules of consciousness, and R
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is some much simpler property of consciousness (say: it learns form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience), then R is only much simpler than G in our current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of the universe; in hash equivalent settings, R does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualify as being &quot;much simpler&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Philosophical consequence: different hash equivalent ways of looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at problems are not equivalent. Since we essentially cannot deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hash functions in any computable way, the different ways things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set up are very important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Punch line: Let E be an explanation of consciousness, (an explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the sense we are used to). Let F be a GLUT, hash equivalent to E.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then though E and F are hash equivalent, they are not equivalent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially from our point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hope this helps! I don't know if it's all that useful, though.
