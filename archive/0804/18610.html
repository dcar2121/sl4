<em>&gt; You talk about these utilities (with underspecified meaning) as if

</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptation-executing. They learn when to be happy, and when suicidal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on context (not that it's easy to control such learning).

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know a utility function is just a model.  These tests of happiness only
<br>
measure how people answer the question &quot;are you happy?&quot;  It is like if someone
<br>
got in a car accident and was severely injured and says &quot;I was lucky.  I could
<br>
have been killed&quot;.  Was he really lucky?
<br>
<p>When people say they are happy, they are comparing their situation to some
<br>
imagined situation.  So what are you really measuring?
<br>
<p>But my point is that if you expect AGI to make boundless happiness possible, I
<br>
think you will be disappointed.  How would you program a brain, or any
<br>
intelligent system, to experience accumulated happiness that grows without
<br>
bound?  I don't think you could do it on humans with drugs, wireheading,
<br>
simulation, or neural reprogramming.  If you think it is possible for any
<br>
intelligent system, then define the system, define happiness, and show me the
<br>
code.
