<p>From: &quot;Nick Tarleton&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:nickptar@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Purpose%20of%20the%20speculation?%20(was%20Re:%20Bounded%20population)">nickptar@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;Well, like he said, it's *what you care about*, which is not arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or, rather, what you currently care about is contingent, but the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you already have values means you can't pick any random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extrapolation), and which people have reasoned about for quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;while.
</em><br>
<p>What's the purpose of this speculation?  I can imagine several possibilities:
<br>
<p>A. Be ready in case we get to the point where we can self-modify more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effectively than now and replace our present unconscious utility function
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with something we figured out.  In that case, the utility function
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should describe human desires.  But what's the point in this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed self-modification?  We might figure it out wrong, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the copy can't be more accurate than the original, so I see risk
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without benefit.
<br>
<p>B. Be ready in case we can build something new that has a utility
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function we can specify.  In that case, the utility function should
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;describe desires that are compatible with humans liking the actions
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen by this new something.  No human really has the satisfaction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of other humans as their highest value, so in this case the problem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is to design a new utility function.  If this is the plan, I'm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confused by Eliezer saying that the utility function is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up for grabs.
<br>
<p>C. One-upmanship, to win an argument with a bunch of people you met on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this mailing list.  In that case, you want to prove the other guy wrong,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if he says A you want to imply that A is stupid and B is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obviously the goal, and vice versa, and of course C isn't the goal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at all because one-upmanship is bad.
