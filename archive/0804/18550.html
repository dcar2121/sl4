<p><em>&gt; Okay, here's a question -- Do you know a way to do something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hutter's AIXI that has the concept of respect for private property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built in?
</em><br>
<p>I must defer to others here about that.  No, I have no idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, here's an easier question: can you express the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private property formally?  (This omits the part about respecting it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it lets you pick the formalism.)
</em><br>
<p>I'll take a wild (and amaturish) swing. In any computing environment I
<br>
will say that there are agents, or processes, which (should) own their
<br>
own execution space, e.g., not as in Core Wars. Capability OS's
<br>
go far in this direction, or so I am informed <a href="http://www.cap-lore.com/">http://www.cap-lore.com/</a> .
<br>
<p>So in parallel with this &quot;ownership&quot; of data space, we have some
<br>
bytes in any object, or text that refers to an object, which indicate
<br>
the owning entity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are weird property-like things, like water rights, stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; options, and patents.  A correct solution will have some process for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deciding who owns various parts of the moon, by the time it makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical difference.  Partial solutions are welcome.
</em><br>
<p>Water rights don't look too hard to me (at least theoretically). 
<br>
But maybe it's more complicated than (1) access paths to the
<br>
owned water, and (2) a given ownership fraction of some body
<br>
of water (delimited in three dimensions).
<br>
<p>I wouldn't venture to adventure into stock options and patents  :-)

<p><em>&gt; I think I've done this for human desire on my web site below.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really like to be able to say &quot;rule of law&quot; or &quot;property rights&quot; with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those primitives, but I don't know where to start.  Thus I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical AI that doesn't care about rule of law or respect for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; private property, but it does care about giving people what they want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't expect to end up advocating communism.  :-(.
