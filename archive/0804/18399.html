<em>&gt;&gt;  By the way, Jeff mentioned that it would be cruel and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  unethical to not pay the $2, but we get to the heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of the problem by supposing---of course, entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  hypothetically---that Matt (or whoever is speaking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  i.e., the subject of the query) is what I have called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  an MSI (a most selfish individual). We wish to ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  what an MSI would do, and what are the logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  reasons one way or the other for his choices, given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that the MSI values existing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the question of what a &quot;most selfish&quot; individual would do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not well-defined, since the self is not well-defined.
</em><br>
<p>But we *do* have an idea of what selfish behavior is, 
<br>
especially in this particular instance. By expressing 
<br>
(and really, we assuming *acting* as though you have)
<br>
concerns for whether or not someone you don't know
<br>
in Africa gets tortured, you clearly are not selfish in
<br>
that regard.  And if you refused to call someone who
<br>
was completely indifferent to the African's suffering
<br>
&quot;selfish&quot;, then your use of terms would be at variance
<br>
with other speakers of English.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It all depends on which future copies of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you regard as your &quot;future self&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is purely a language convention.
</em><br>
<p>But surely you don't really believe that it's only a
<br>
matter of &quot;language convention&quot;. Suppose the
<br>
Gestapo arrived at your doorstep and proceeded
<br>
to set up the apparatus to torture you, but the
<br>
Colonel in charge had a philosophic turn of mind,
<br>
he might say, &quot;You really should not appear so
<br>
apprehensive Mr. Jones---it's purely a language
<br>
convention as to whether you or someone else
<br>
is going to shortly undergo suffering.&quot;  Do you
<br>
really expect us to believe that it's identically the
<br>
same to you whether they do it to you or do it
<br>
some random African?  You really don't believe
<br>
that there is a fact of the matter?
<br>
<p>To add on, suppose that you love X, and right
<br>
before an extremely painful operation, you express
<br>
sympathy for X and tell her so. Would you be lying
<br>
if you then added &quot;of course, whether it's you who
<br>
undergoes the pain or some random African is
<br>
actually indifferent to me&quot;?  Or would that be the
<br>
truth (however hurtful the statement itself might be)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To add to Matt's original thought experiment, here is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a chain of related thought experiments I find interesting:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Is it ethical to use a &quot;date rape&quot; drug on someone who isn't going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to remember much in the morning, but will be unable to resist your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances during the night?
</em><br>
<p>I say that it is not, because whether or not an individual
<br>
remembers something is immaterial to the physical 
<br>
reality of whether or not it happened to him or her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  Is it ethical to rape someone and then erase their memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely (or fix them afterwards so that they believe it never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened, or they have a blackout)?
</em><br>
<p>Likewise, it is not ethical (by which, as I have said, I mean 
<br>
little more than &quot;I disapprove&quot; or &quot;we customarily disapprove
<br>
or we should disapprove&quot;).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3.  Is it ethical to torture someone and then erase their memories of it?
</em><br>
<p>Likewise.  While it's bad to *add* memories of having been
<br>
tortured, it is much worse to actually torture someone (leaving
<br>
their memories as usual).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;don't worry, I'll erase your memory later.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>:-)    There isn't anyone who would fail to be upset, if
<br>
we are all using the same meaning of the word &quot;torture&quot;,
<br>
because the phrasing indicates that the torturer is may
<br>
be committing his hideous acts based upon a simple
<br>
misunderstanding or misapprehension.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;don't worry, I've made a backup of your brain and I will use it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make an exact copy of you on my home planet, as soon as I figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to do so... which should only take a few years.  I'm not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torture your copy when it wakes up, so it's fine if I torture you now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I'm going to kill you soon so it won't matter at all.  Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy won't remember any of this.&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Naturally, that would be terrible. The proper way to look at it
<br>
is to integrate (or, trying to be less fancy, *sum*) over all
<br>
instances of your runtime, and try to evaluate preferences
<br>
accordingly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;don't worry I've *already* made a copy of you, so you are redundant&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;don't worry, I've already made a copy of you *and* I'm going to erase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your memories soon, so you won't be you at all but the copy will be.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8.  Would you be fine with such torture happening to you, as long as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy was made somewhere else, and as long as you consented to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beforehand?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think number 8 is essentially the question that Matt is asking...
</em><br>
<p>I think that I agree entirely with you and the point you're making here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I don't really see how 8 is different from 7, 7 is different from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6, etc.  I would answer &quot;no&quot; to all of these for the same reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being tortured would upset me... I wouldn't want anyone to do it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, and I wouldn't want to do it to anyone else (including my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;original&quot; future self) regardless of how many copies of me were made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and when.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely.  But our point of view implies, at least to me,
<br>
that we regard all our copies equally, on the same ontological
<br>
footing as it were. &quot;Bad runtime&quot; + &quot;good runtime&quot; is either bad
<br>
or good depending on which of the two is greater quantitatively.
