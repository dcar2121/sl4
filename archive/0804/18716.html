<p>This is a bizarrely collectivist-type argument (your value to society
<br>
justifies your existence) from an apparent libertarian. What about the
<br>
value, to that person, of their continued existence? Surely, even if
<br>
they can't produce any value for others, and even if they have no
<br>
money or other resources with which to express their preference, their
<br>
preference should count *ethically*, should be as much a part of the
<br>
global utility function as anyone else's. Many of us have this crazy
<br>
idea that people have intrinsic worth independent of their economic
<br>
circumstances or value or utility to others.
<br>
<p>(I hesitate to post this as it's clearly not SL4, but I find this view
<br>
so repugnant I can't resist.)
