</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, that is not the case.  All I can say with certainty is that after I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upload, there will be something that claims to be me that is realistic enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fool all of my friends and relatives.  The relevant facts are my fear of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death (therefore I will upload) and belief in consciousness (therefore I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that my future upload will be &quot;me&quot; if I preserve my memories).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But every thought experiment I do proves that my beliefs are wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example: teleportation.  It works like this.  I step into a booth at point A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a copy of me is produced at point B.  The copy at point A is slowly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painfully killed by being crushed between the soundproofed walls of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleportation booth in a process that takes 24 hours.  For $2 extra I have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; option of having the copy at point A injected with an overdose of a narcotic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the death fast and painless.  But I have teleported hundreds of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both ways and can't tell the difference.  I always come out at point B and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would rather save the money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I making the right decision?  My tribal elders can't help me.  They say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that consciousness can't be copied.
</em><br>
<p>That's actually not what the elders would say. They would probably say that copying 
<br>
and transferring are two nonequivalent operations and, while consciounsess could 
<br>
certainly be duplicated, transferring-by-copying operation will not exist as long 
<br>
as 2 != 1. They would probably advise you to avoid teleportation and stick 
<br>
exclusively to nondestructive uploading.
