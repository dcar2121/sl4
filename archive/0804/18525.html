<em>&gt;  Just because we've always done things like this in the past doesn't make it right for the future.  Ownership makes a lot of sense in conditions of scarcity but I strongly doubt that it is rational in conditions of plenty -- and in intermediate conditions, like those of today, I think that the concept of private property (and the necessity that everyone *must* work) is actually getting in the way of moving towards a condition of plenty (and fairness and happiness).

<p>Haven't we shown, through numerous experiments on a huge scale, that
<br>
communism doesn't work? All of human civilization was built by
<br>
incentives- people build things because it's better to build them than
<br>
to not build them. Once you abolish private property, you destroy all
<br>
of those incentives, because everyone can just take whatever it is
<br>
that you've built. See
