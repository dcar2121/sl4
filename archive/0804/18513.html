<em>&gt;  This not an argument for depriving them of all rights - some humans

</em><br>
<p>I absolutely agree.  It seems we currently have or are very near the
<br>
laboratory meat factory now.  We can create our food stuffs from
<br>
simple building blocks.  The cow concern or any other animal/plant we
<br>
rely on in the Maslovian sense is almost strictly an economic/social
<br>
issue.  With the super duper AI, it seems completely a none issue.
<br>
Cows live or die outside of the need for food by fitting into the AI's
<br>
fulfillment of its perceived needs for us and the cows.
