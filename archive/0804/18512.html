<em>&gt;Otherwise it's arbitrary and there will probably be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tedious and depressing political battle over it.
</em><br>
<p>I hope there will be! What the moral system of the AI is will be vital
<br>
to the whole future of humanity. How to make the decision?
<br>
<p>Schematically:
<br>
<p>1) The decision is made by the programmers.
<br>
2) The decision is made by a small group of people with their own
<br>
interest in mind.
<br>
3) The decision is made by a small group of altruistic people.
<br>
4) The decision is made by some sort of democratic process, strongly
<br>
guided by those with a good understanding of the issues.
<br>
5) The decision is made by some sort of pure democratic process.
<br>
<p>My top choice is 4; I even prefer it to 3 (since the small group of
<br>
altruistic people may just not know about issues relevant to many
<br>
people). In that case there will be &quot;a tedious and depressing
<br>
political battle over it&quot;. And many things I would want to see will
<br>
not come to pass...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm interested in answers to the question &quot;What do we want the AI to do?&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That's almost an afterthought, to the much more pressing question:
<br>
what would we want the AI not to do? Pick a couple of nice results -
<br>
immortality, world peace, uploading, ultra-enhanced intelligence or
<br>
empathy - and they could be added to what a supreme AI could do for us
<br>
easily.
<br>
<p>Much more interesting to my mind, is the question: &quot;what do we want an
<br>
AI of large but not crushing intelligence to do?&quot;
