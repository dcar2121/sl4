<em>&gt; &gt; So, if I was an MP [Member of Parliament], I would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; vote to allow most forms of destructive teleportation if the issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; came up - but would be terrified of trying them out myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;Vote to allow&quot;?  How jolly condescending of you!  I hope that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you would also &quot;vote to allow&quot; people to take their own lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (with the proper filling out of forms, at least, so that murder or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  temporary insanity could be ruled out). I also would hope that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you would vote to allow people to ingest whatever substances
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  they chose, provided it resulted in harm to no one else. Dear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Stuart, sorry for my abrasive and aggressive phrasing and tone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but this is my morning personality that likes to cut through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  straight to the issues :-)  give no quarter, and speak very frankly.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, don't you know the MP's motto? If in doubt, ban it? If not in
<br>
doubt, ban it anyway? For an MP to actually allow something is an
<br>
exceptional event! :-)
<br>
<p>But to answer your question properly, I'd have to delve a little into
<br>
libertarianism, and my attitude towards it. Been meaning to do that
<br>
for some time, so let's do it!
<br>
<p>First of all, I am in favour of increasing the liberty of the maximum
<br>
amount of people. Basically everyone on this list is as well, so let's
<br>
move on. Where I part from philosophical libertarianism can be summed
<br>
up by the words &quot;if you're in jail, the identity of the jailer is not
<br>
the first concern&quot;.
<br>
<p>To pick an extreme example, if you die of starvation because the food
<br>
is unfordable or because the government has taken it away from you,
<br>
then the difference is not your primary concern. If you can't start a
<br>
company that sells rockets to people because the government forbids
<br>
it, or because rockets haven't been invented yet, the end result is
<br>
the same: no company.
<br>
<p>So the first question I would ask of any law, is &quot;does it maximise
<br>
liberty overall?&quot;. I also have a tendency to prioritise laws that
<br>
maximise the liberty of the poor (simply because, if you're rich, you
<br>
can buy yourself out of most inconveniences, and you have a large
<br>
amount of liberty anyway).
<br>
<p>So far, so socialist! But what does this mean in practice? Well, here,
<br>
insert the practical libertarian arguments, which to my mind are
<br>
infinitely stronger than the theoretical ones. The superiority of
<br>
semi-market economies over purely centralised ones is an evident fact.
<br>
Nothing is more degrading to liberty than having your thoughts
<br>
policed, and this has no upside: so in comes freedom of thought and
<br>
speech. Also, libertarian ideas are humble in a good way: they
<br>
acknowledge that governments don't always know what's best for you,
<br>
that actions will have unintended consequences, that dependence
<br>
weakeness people. It gets solutions which are often quite close to
<br>
ideal, without weighting people down with rules. So in a lot of ways,
<br>
I'd be a practical libertarian.
<br>
<p>But there are limits, and not just the obvious ones about &quot;police&quot;,
<br>
&quot;rule of law&quot; and &quot;anti-cartel legislation&quot;. There are a plethora of
<br>
small rules that boost liberty without imposing major costs; labeling
<br>
laws, some environmental restrictions, quite a bit of health and
<br>
safety rules, vaccinations, public defenders, some uniform standards
<br>
(for electricity, eg), a stable currency, long-term R&amp;D, etc...
<br>
(I know that there are libertarian alternatives that, it is claimed,
<br>
would replace all these with very similar, non-coercive mechanisms; my
<br>
response to that is that the superiority of these approaches remains
<br>
unproven, and that doing a massive change to end up with the same
<br>
practical result is pretty pointless).
<br>
<p>There are also a handful of major governmental programs which (pending
<br>
further evidence, of course) I believe have been massive promoters of
<br>
liberty, at least for the majority. Some examples are universal
<br>
education, the part of the EU that is about removing restrictions to
<br>
movement of people and goods, guarantees of private bank accounts,
<br>
government support to the university system, and, last but not least,
<br>
independent central banks to intervene in the economy (they may be
<br>
independent, but their independence and their power both derive from
<br>
the government).
<br>
<p>More to the point, western countries now have a huge governmental GDP;
<br>
generally, at least a third of the economy is governmental. This seems
<br>
to produce somewhat slower growth rates (though some economists
<br>
disagree with me), but has not ushered in the apocalypse. A major
<br>
low-government western economy doesn't exist at the moment; the
<br>
example of the United States, where a low level of regulation led
<br>
directly to the explosion of private law-suits and of businesses
<br>
lobbying politics, leads me to feel that low-government in the modern
<br>
world is a *potentially* dangerous experiment (certainly untried),
<br>
which I must be convinced will work, and work better than nowadays,
<br>
before I endorse it (not that my endorsement means anything :-)
<br>
<p>So basically I'm a practical liberal with libertarian tendencies - if
<br>
the issue are finely balanced, I'll go for the libertarian side.
<br>
<p>Now back to the &quot;vote to allow&quot;. If the following were true:
<br>
1) I was convinced that destructive teleportation was a form of murder,
<br>
2) I was convinced that if permitted, then DT would become ubiquitous,
<br>
and everyone would be pretty much forced (by non-coercive practical
<br>
considerations) to make use of it,
<br>
3) I was convinced that, if banned, DT would not come into general use
<br>
on some form of black market,
<br>
4) I was convinced that banning DT would not impose a huge burden on people,
<br>
<p>then I would vote to ban it. (my position on euthanasia is similarly
<br>
tied up with practical considerations - the major argument against it
<br>
is that people would be pressured into it. But that is a practical
<br>
argument, not a philosophical one, and seems to be untrue)
<br>
<p><p>Now, the connection to AI? Well, due to that way of seeing the world,
<br>
I don't share the belief that all we need to do is &quot;solve FAI, then
<br>
get out of the way&quot;. There will be choices to be made for a FAI; some
<br>
people will lose more than others, and that adopting a purely
<br>
&quot;libertarian&quot; approach to these choices may end up with less liberty.
<br>
<p>Anyway, that was my brief answer to your question :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Best personal regards as always,
</em><br>
<p>And the same! Hope this has made my views a little clearer,
<br>
Stuart
