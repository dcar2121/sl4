<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;survive&quot; isn't a well defined term in a post-singularity world.
</em><br>
<p>There was a time when temperature was not a well defined
<br>
concept. But those who would have claimed that it would
<br>
someday have an objective meaning were proven right.
<br>
There is no reason that *consciousness* and *survival*
<br>
cannot become much better understood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't care, definitions are of trivial importance, and it's foolish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ask for a definition of &quot;definition&quot;, if you already know you don't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to ask and if you don't then the question makes no sense. To hell with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; definitions, examples rule! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, your willingness to step into a teleportation booth and die,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided that an exact copy of you is made at the same instant, but not if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is made 10 seconds earlier.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I don't expect to learn why John is so squeamish on the matter.
<br>
But what's your view?  Have you said?  Specifically, how much would
<br>
you have to be paid to lose 10 seconds', 10 hours', 10 days', etc., memories?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On close analysis, our logic leads us to absurdities such as the teleportation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you assume that everyone knows what you're talking about.
<br>
I hope you can be more explicit from now on. There is nothing
<br>
absurd about teleportation in principle, and after we're uploaded
<br>
one might routinely teleport from one machine to another, even
<br>
if the other is on another planet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If consciousness resides in the brain, and the brain is a computer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then what we want to preserve must be its memories and function.
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if your memories were altered, you would not know the difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your goals were altered, you would not want them changed back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they were.
</em><br>
<p>So what? Many bad things could happen to me of which I was unaware.
<br>
Due to identity theft or something, I may have lost a lot of money today,
<br>
or my mother might've died. But better---and much more precisely---
<br>
I might have today forgotten all the rudimentary German and French I
<br>
once knew. So, just as one could be (harmfully) diminshed by losses
<br>
like these (and not be aware of it), so could one be harmed by having
<br>
one's memories changed.
<br>
<p>You may ask, &quot;why does memory change harm one?&quot;.  The answer 
<br>
is, &quot;because you could slowly be turned into someone else&quot; by a 
<br>
series of shifts that would be easy to describe. Then, eventually,
<br>
there wouldn't be a you, only two of that other person. You would
<br>
be dead, and that brings us full circle to being greatly harmed, 
<br>
(supposing your life is worth living).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what is it really that you want to preserve?
</em><br>
<p>There's no doubt of it:  memories and runtime.
<br>
<p>Lee
