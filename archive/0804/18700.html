<p><p>Do you expect the AIs to be precisely identical in terms of skills, goals,

different from having a 'barter' system of measurement: &quot;How far away is

multiplied by the length of Freud's first cat on its eighth birthday.&quot; Why

oh why oh why would we stop converting things to standard measurements to
