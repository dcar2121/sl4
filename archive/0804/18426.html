<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But we *do* have an idea of what selfish behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is, especially in this particular instance. By expressing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (and really, we assuming *acting* as though you have)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concerns for whether or not someone you don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in Africa gets tortured, you clearly are not selfish in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that regard.  And if you refused to call someone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was completely indifferent to the African's suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;selfish&quot;, then your use of terms would be at variance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with other speakers of English.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have concerns for those I don't know in the general sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of wishing all humans to be treated with at least what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider minimum standards.   But while I generally have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this wish for all it is not my personal high[est] concern.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally I don't believe it has anything to do with being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;selfish&quot; or not and I think that is sloppy use of loaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminology.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, all right.  But you probably see what I was getting at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Do you really expect us to believe that it's identically the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same to you whether they do it to you or do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some random African?  You really don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that there is a fact of the matter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hear that.  It would certainly make a difference to me.
</em><br>
<p>Well, at least you and I (and I think the vast majority)
<br>
agree on that.
<br>
<p>To add on, suppose that you love X, and right
<br>
before an extremely painful operation, you express
<br>
sympathy for X and tell her so. Would you be lying
<br>
if you then added &quot;of course, whether it's you who
<br>
undergoes the pain or some random African is
<br>
actually indifferent to me&quot;?  Or would that be the
<br>
truth (however hurtful the statement itself might be)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if I want to degrade someone I would want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to remember that also.  Otherwise, whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the point?
</em><br>
<p>Well, as you know, some people wish to degrade
<br>
others for sexual gratification. There are probably
<br>
other people who you and I would equally condemn
<br>
who might wish to degrade others in various ways.
<br>
That is the point.  To these people, it may in fact
<br>
be very convenient that the victim remembers 
<br>
nothing. 
<br>
<p>I suggest that though (agreeing with Matt) it would
<br>
be better for them to not remember some hideous
<br>
thing that happened to them, that by *no means*
<br>
removes (a) the fact that something terrible did 
<br>
happen to them and (b) *your* evident concern
<br>
that the *act* itself of so degrading them was
<br>
despicable.  I agree with you, but your (b) was
<br>
not the point Matt and I were discussing (and
<br>
I think agreeing upon).
<br>
<p>One of Matt's next questions was
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 2.  Is it ethical to rape someone and then erase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;      their memories completely (or fix them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;      afterwards so that they believe it never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;      happened, or they have a blackout)?
</em><br>
<p>and I wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Likewise, it is not ethical (by which, as I have said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean little more than &quot;I disapprove&quot; or &quot;we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customarily disapprove or we should disapprove&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>and Samantha says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I mean a great deal more than that.  To force the will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of another intelligent being in such a brutish fashion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes one obviously unfit for society. 
</em><br>
<p>That's a claim that depends on your particular society.
<br>
In some societies, exactly the reverse made people 
<br>
unfit.  Recall the Viking who refused to pinion English
<br>
babies on the end of his sword and swing them about.
<br>
The other Vikings thought this very strange, and it 
<br>
probably lessened his status among them. But I think
<br>
that I agree totally with the general sentiment of what
<br>
you are saying.   But very objectively speaking, it 
<br>
comes down to little more than you and I and almost
<br>
everyone in our society today disapproving most
<br>
strenuously.
<br>
<p>Matt's subsequent query:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; 5.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       you and then said &quot;don't worry, I've made a backup
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       of your brain and I will use it to make an exact copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       of you on my home planet, as soon as I figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       how to do so... which should only take a few years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       I'm not going to torture your copy when it wakes up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       so it's fine if I torture you now. In fact, I'm going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       kill you soon so it won't matter at all.  Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;       copy won't remember any of this.&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Naturally [I, Lee, responded] , that would be terrible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The proper way to look at it is to sum over all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; instances of your runtime, and try to evaluate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; preferences accordingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WHAT??  I don't need to sum over any instances to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemn such behavior toward or by any and all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my instances.
</em><br>
<p>But someone might ask you &quot;why?&quot;. It seems to me that
<br>
your most logical response---since you and I do certainly
<br>
and heartily agree on the answer---would be along the
<br>
lines that &quot;overall benefit for me (Samantha)&quot; would be
<br>
greatly lowered by such an outcome. 
<br>
<p>But honestly, it seems to me that you are more interested
<br>
in *condemning* the act itself rather than the outcome of
<br>
the act.  Of course, the two are indeed normally tied
<br>
together, so I don't blame you.  It's just that it's interesting
<br>
for me to note that the righteousness of behavior appears
<br>
to be much more important than the evaluation of the
<br>
actual results of actions. You might be interested in
<br>
Socrates' ancient question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be better to be perfectly unjust and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet be regarded by everyone in society as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfectly just, or better to be perfectly just
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and yet be regarded by all as perfectly unjust?
<br>
<p>which we might write a modern equivalent
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be better to cheat and steal from 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone around you, yet do so in a fashion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you wouldn't ever be caught and would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even have your reputation greatly enhanced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or better to be perfectly honest, but have to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undergo a great deal of disdain from others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(for unstated hypothetical reasons)?
<br>
<p>On that one, I myself, would prefer to be honest but
<br>
despised.  Yet one can make a very similar sounding
<br>
modern version
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would it be better to be a great liar and cheater
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(but in a way that because, say, you are so good
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at investing) no one's standard of living is reduced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(but rather enhanced), and in every way esteemed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by all as beneficent and just, or would it be better
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be entirely upright but held up as a terrible 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example to everyone of a cheater and liar?
<br>
<p>In that one, I admit that it would be better to be the cheater
<br>
and liar, IMO.
<br>
<p>I ended by writing to Matt:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree completely.  But our point of view implies, at least to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we regard all our copies equally, on the same ontological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; footing as it were. &quot;Bad runtime&quot; + &quot;good runtime&quot; is either bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or good depending on which of the two is greater quantitatively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this really about ethics or some mad guess about some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothetical  future where nothing  really matters because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are all redundantly backed up and no one really dies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real death or suffers real suffering?  Is it all just &quot;experience&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do we fall into techno- solipsism?   
</em><br>
<p>I think it is indeed about ethics. Also I think the actual experience
<br>
people (entities) undergo is of vital importance in making ethical
<br>
and moral decisions. We certainly do not want to fall into *any*
<br>
kind of solipsism!
