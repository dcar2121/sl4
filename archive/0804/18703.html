<em>&gt; If I understand you right, this does not include my CD (that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music) collection, since that has essentially no connection to my self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or right to exist.  I agree that my self and right to exist are good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things to preserve, and likewise yours too.  However, the normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of property rights seems to imply that I get to keep my CD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection unless I voluntarily transfer it elsewhere, but I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how your argument is getting there.
</em><br>
<p><p>If we have the right to make our future choices, then we can have the right
<br>
to make choice A in exchange for something that we can use to acquire CDs.
<br>
So if you have the right to choose whether or not to work, you can choose to
<br>
work and get money in exchange. If you deny this, then you're denying that
<br>
your future choices are yours to make, which seems radical.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I thought property rights meant that if you made enough bad trades, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you start out from a bad-enough position, you could find yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without food or a way to get food because all the food is property of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone else, so you starve to death.
</em><br>
<p><p>If you can't find anyone who would be willing to lend you money for food,
<br>
even at an extremely high interest rate, it's confusing as to why you think
<br>
you should go on existing, if 1) nobody else thinks you're worth keeping
<br>
around, and 2) you haven't even been able to keep yourself going. We
<br>
presently have a system in which we sell ourselves into partial slavery in
<br>
order that massa government might bail us out of our poor decisions. Perhaps
<br>
if this activity were opened up to more competition (e.g. multiple AIs with
<br>
different terms of servitude) we would get better customer service.
<br>
<p>The difference between these scenarios is who owns the meal.  How can
<br>
<em>&gt; we specify an algorithm that looks at the history leading up to these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points and computes who owns what?
</em><br>
<p><p>It's pretty computationally intensive to look at the whole history, from
<br>
&quot;The Normans conquered that particular plot in 1067, and granted it to A,
<br>
who granted it to B ... ... .... who sold it to FoodConGlom, Ltd., in 1999,
<br>
which .... ... ...&quot; In fact, we have property rights rather than
<br>
'transaction histories' specifically to avoid this sort of thing. An AI that
<br>
adhered to a common rights-protocol would have an answer; an AI that didn't
<br>
adhere would, in the eyes of other entities, be frequently guilty of theft
<br>
and thus probably punished.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Do we want the AI to respect property rights, or do we want the AI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be willing to feed the hungry guy if he's hungry enough, nevermind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights?
</em><br>
<p><p>Why is feeding a hungry guy predicated on violating property rights? Is the
<br>
AI not clever enough to accumulate assets of its own for such purposes? Why
<br>
can't it buy the meal? Why can't it feed the guy if he promises to paint its
<br>
house? The options are either a) homeless guy is worth less to the world
<br>
than the food required to feed him, in which case he's hard to justify
<br>
except as an entertaining pet for the AI -- which itself is worth something,
<br>
thus shifting us over to b) he is worth more than he costs to keep around,
<br>
in which case an intermediary that keeps him alive will have lots of pricing
<br>
power for earning the difference between his cost and his potential. As long
<br>
as we make slavery contractual and based on individuals, rather than
<br>
mandatory and based on states, this is a non-problem.
