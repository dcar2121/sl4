<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Question:  would you prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (A)  to be tortured for an hour in the old-fashioned way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (B)  for records of such an hour merely to be retrieved from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        a galaxy far, far away a long time ago in which you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        tortured just the same, and merely the states for that hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        interval brought to Earth and at the proper moment merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        looked up?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From a philosophical point of view, I can see [the point made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Stathis that (A) and (B) are indifferent to him]  - but I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to inject some practical caveats here. If I was given such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice, I would jump at (B) instantly. Partly because of anticipation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pain (which is much more important to me right now than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipation of the end of pain).
</em><br>
<p>I do believe that Stathis would also anticipate the pain in (B) just
<br>
as you and I and he would in (A). Our anticipation is a feeling,
<br>
however, and I'll have to post a link to an essay I have called
<br>
&quot;The Anticipation Dilemma&quot; wherein I attempt to show that
<br>
this feeling cannot be made entirely consistent with itself under
<br>
what-have-to-be-equivalent circumstances. Anyway, I don't
<br>
think that anticipation is quite relevant to the discussion that
<br>
Stathis and I were having.  But is *very* relevant here in this
<br>
thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But mainly because if we tweak this example, we get highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-intuitive consequences. What about &quot;get tortured now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and left to live for ten years while slowly recuperating&quot; vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;in ten year's time, have a distant memory of being tortured&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I totally agree that any kind of memory addition is truly
<br>
preferable to actually experiencing severe torture. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The evolution of our memories - vivid events become less vivid,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sometimes get erased entirely - seems to militate against total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalence between &quot;C happened&quot; and &quot;everyone remembers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that C happened (but it didn't)&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I completely agree. But consider the hideous Clock/Torture
<br>
Experiment:
<br>
<p>You are held captive in on the stage of a large auditorium and
<br>
must undergo terrible pain or at least memory of having had
<br>
terrible pain.  All the people in the audience, who you can see,
<br>
hope and pray for what is truly best for you, and can be taken
<br>
as what you would prefer could a different one of your selves
<br>
also sit in the audience.
<br>
<p>You can see the hands of a large clock, the only important part
<br>
being the second hand that revolves once a minute between 0
<br>
seconds, all the way round to 59 seconds, and then recommences
<br>
the cycle. 
<br>
<p>During the time 50-60 seconds, you may press button A or button
<br>
B, with the following consequences which have been explained to
<br>
you ahead of time, and which you understand completely.
<br>
<p>A:  You are tortured hideously for 40 seconds, but then the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memory is erased, and you have a relatively very pleasant
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 seconds before the cycle begins again
<br>
<p>B.  You have a very pleasant 40 seconds, able to engage in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conversation with your friends and relatives, watch TV,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or continue reading a book.  But at 40 seconds, a false
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;memory is added of being tortured hideously from 0 to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40, although your memory is otherwise not molested:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very much as though you remember reading your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book or whatever for 40 seconds and then underwent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrible and unbearable pain for 40 more seconds somehow.
<br>
<p>Logically, you should choose B, because memory addition isn't 
<br>
true experience (forgetting the follow-up experience of remembering
<br>
and shuddering).  You may succeed for quite a while continuing to
<br>
choose B, especially since your friends and family, who fully know
<br>
the situation, keep encouraging you to make this sensible decision.
<br>
<p>But the horrible memory and anticipatory dread of another 40
<br>
seconds of unbearable pain finally compel you to give A a shot.
<br>
You instantly regret the decision during the next 40 seconds, as
<br>
the actual experience is even worse than merely &quot;having&quot; the
<br>
memories had been. But then, at the end of the 40 seconds, your
<br>
memory of the torture for this minute is completely erased.
<br>
<p>What does it then seem like happened to you? It seems to you
<br>
that by choosing A, the clock hand suddenly jumped from 0 to
<br>
40, and you avoided (you intuit) anything unpleasant. Despite
<br>
seeing your friends and family in tears, and despite your own
<br>
best knowledge of the entire setup, you gradually come to choose
<br>
A all of the time.  Dreadful, but true.  Perhaps some readers are
<br>
shocked. I was.
