<p><em>&gt; I can't prove it formally, yet -- but have you ever noticed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the very concept of private property, beyond the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bounds of need, is probably the biggest contributor to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil in the world?
</em><br>
<p>I doubt very much that you can back this up historically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why should anyone *own* various parts of the moon?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you aren't using it, why should you be able to hog it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and insist that others pay you for the right to use it?
</em><br>
<p>An entity had to pay for the ownership in one way or
<br>
another, e.g., laying claim to new territory by exploring
<br>
it. Other entities who wish to develop (i.e. use in a more
<br>
advanced or profitable manner) may then bid up its
<br>
price.
<br>
<p>This, incidentally, provides incentive for some entity to
<br>
take the first steps of exploration, or doing whatever
<br>
minimal work that is needed to make a valid claim.
<br>
<p>Private property has so far worked best because some
<br>
entity's whole attention is focused on the value of that
<br>
property and how it can be most profitably used. See
<br>
&quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot; by Thomas Sowell to back
<br>
up my claims about price-signals and how they affect
<br>
not only property, but everything in a well-functioning
<br>
economy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just because we've always done things like this in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past doesn't make it right for the future.
</em><br>
<p>That's true. But the history of brilliant human beings devising
<br>
schemes that omit private property and free market 
<br>
mechanisms is, as you know, sordid. But these same
<br>
brilliant human beings are now thinking about laying down
<br>
quite general laws that would apply to everyone and everything
<br>
via Ruling AIs. This is in defiance of the necessity of local,
<br>
focused, specialized knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ownership makes a lot of sense in conditions of scarcity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I strongly doubt that it is rational in conditions of plenty
</em><br>
<p>You may be right. But we don't know. We should start with
<br>
what works and go from there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- and in intermediate conditions, like those of today,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the concept of private property (and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessity that everyone *must* work) is actually getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the way of moving towards a condition of plenty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and fairness and happiness).
</em><br>
<p>There have been many socialist utopian dreamers before
<br>
you, Mark.  I would urge empirical investigation prior to
<br>
excessive theoretical rumination about a &quot;better system&quot;.
