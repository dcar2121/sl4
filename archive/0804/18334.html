Stathis homes in for the kill:

<em>&gt;&gt;  One possibility [of the scenario you were proposing]

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  way of experience [according to my view], of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess it is possible if only the lower motor neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling speech are normal and the rest of the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is looked up that you could be a complete zombie,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since presumably lower motor neurons are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in consciousness, or at any rate not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, an almost complete zombie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But in the thought experiment we could identify every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuron from the retina up that is involved in visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing, and replace these with looked up analogues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You would then have no visual experience at all, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would look at a picture of a dog, accurately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe the picture, write an evocative poem about it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and truly and honestly believe that you are looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a picture of a dog; while in fact you are completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bereft [on your view] of any visual experience.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But here, of course, you have sliced and diced
<br>
what is meant by &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot; or &quot;you&quot; or &quot;one&quot;. There
<br>
are other ways to dissolve identity, such as split-
<br>
brain experiments, or the wonderful exposition
<br>
&quot;The Story of a Brain&quot; by Arnold Zuboff, in Hofstadter's
<br>
and Dennett's &quot;The Mind's I&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you believe that this is possible, then you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit that you have no evidence right now to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the theory that you are actually seeing this email.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't go so far as to quite endorse that. As yet
<br>
we have no computronium of sufficient density that
<br>
could provide the necessary GLUT, and when I am
<br>
electrically shielded from the outside it's clear that
<br>
my ordinary brain is processing my thoughts according
<br>
to normal causal computation, which I claim, as do you,
<br>
must be conscious so far as we can even speculate
<br>
according to evolutionary theory.
<br>
<p>But, under the extreme situations in which these
<br>
practical considerations are moot, e.g., I've been
<br>
uploaded and the year is 3000 A.D., then it is
<br>
possibly just as you say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You think you are, but if some medical investigation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows that you have been blind for the last twenty years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without knowing it, you won't be able to dismiss it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurd.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, given vastly improved technology that might 
<br>
exist hundreds of years from now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, given that you have always enjoyed (or thought you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoyed!) your visual experiences, you might seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider an expensive and slightly risky operation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restore your sight.
</em><br>
<p>I think that that is exactly true, though clearly some part
<br>
of me is *enjoying* something closely related. But yes,
<br>
it cannot be said that I am enjoying the visual experience
<br>
since according to me it is being looked up.
<br>
<p>It might be very much like someone who has gotten
<br>
used to blindsight, but for whom medical examination
<br>
proves that certain normal pathways have been blocked.
<br>
Your point is well taken, and this is indeed an awkwardness
<br>
in my view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At least you see what you think of as an absurdity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjust the theory (functionalism) to remove the absurdity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most philosophers and cognitive scientists dismiss the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent absurdity and simply carry on as before.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks. I do believe that we are concluding that so far
<br>
as either of us can see, one is forced into my acceptance
<br>
of zombies, or into your acceptance of OMs in platonia,
<br>
(about which I intend to start a separate thread).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  Now, let me phrase my answer using an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  experiment so that there is no mistaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  my meaning.  Question:  would you prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  (A)  to be tortured for an hour in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;         old-fashioned way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  (B)  for records of such an hour merely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;         retrieved from a galaxy far, far away a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;         long time ago in which you were tortured
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;         just the same, and merely the states for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;         that hour interval brought to Earth and at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;         the proper moment merely looked up?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; To be precise, an entire state is swapped into the location where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  reside once every trillionth of a second. None of the states is causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  connected to any of the others:  they could even have been retrieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  from extremely disparate and separated areas of intergalactic space,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  by some random process that just happened to find patches of dust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (Those, by an amazing coincidence, do happen to be the same states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that are now being computed, a trillion to the second, in the city where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  you live, by the ordinary metabolic processes (computations).)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  So can you recapitulate and answer (A) or (B) for sure?  Thanks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  For of course, if your answer differs from mine, I have further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In that case, (A) and (B) would be equivalent.
</em><br>
<p>Allow me to elaborate slightly. A rogue branch of the ANP
<br>
(Australian National Police) is considering whether to 
<br>
<p>A.  seize citizen Stathis Papaioannou and torture him
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for an hour the old fashioned way
<br>
<p>B.  by fantastical means collect patches of dust in our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Tegmark) infinite level one universe separated by
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;millions or trillions of lightyears, and load them 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into memory sequentially in such a manner that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the torture spoken of in (A) is apparently reproduced,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sole difference being that there is no actual
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causal connection between the states (which is so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important in my view)
<br>
<p>C. just save the time and expense of the loading part
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of (B) and just leave them laying around in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;solar system here and there
<br>
<p>D. don't bother even doing (C), but leave them be,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cause the normal Stathis metabolism to not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;operate for the hour, with only the memories
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i.e. the last state that has been collected in (B)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being implanted and normally running resuming
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from there.
<br>
<p>My intent was to leave (A) and (B) without significant
<br>
modification from the earlier discussion, but if you
<br>
suspect I've erred, you can examine the P.S. to this
<br>
post and correct me.
<br>
<p>At any rate, are you indifferent to A, B, C, and D?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Uploading is entirely orthogonal to the argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  we're having. The only feasible way to upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  someone is to entirely simulate with near perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  fidelity the actual computations his or her brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is already achieving. Whether I or some part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  me could in theory be &quot;looked up&quot; now is exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the same issue as to whether some part of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  could be &quot;looked up&quot; after I'm uploaded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone could claim that a perfect simulation might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behave like the original, but it might be unconscious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or at least differently conscious. This the layperson's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usual response to the idea of mind uploading.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a commonly heard claim that you and I dismiss,
<br>
which appears patently faulty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I claim that the argument whereby if part of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain is replaced by the simulation you could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly notice anything had changed *proves*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the simulation must be conscious in exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same way as biological tissue.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and under the extremely hypothetical GLUT
<br>
hypothesis, I disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, according to you, this argument proves nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since it is possible to feel exactly the same while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergoing a process of gradual zombification.
</em><br>
<p>I can't quite agree entirely because of the aforementioned
<br>
small likelihoods of computronium existence or that I'm
<br>
being run in the far future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that's so then there is no *proof* that an upload will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be conscious in the same way as the original. You might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that it sounds reasonable, but ultimately you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to take it on faith.
</em><br>
<p>It would be a very strong sort of faith, though, again for
<br>
the same reason. But yes, if it's really far in the future
<br>
right now, or someone somehow has devised a
<br>
computronium type substance, then functionalism
<br>
is to me---and has not been for many years now---
<br>
entirely 100% correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also have to admit that you might be at least partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a zombie right now, since feeling that you're all conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not count as evidence that this is in fact the case.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't think that that's something that I (or anything
<br>
that was pretending to be me) could or would ever concede.
<br>
For in the case at hand, where I am an evolutionarily
<br>
derived organism, we agree along with right thinking 
<br>
people everywhere  :-)  that I'm conscious. On the
<br>
other hand, if I were just a GLUT with a tiny, simple
<br>
loader program, then since it would simulate (but not
<br>
emulate) me, then it too would erroneously announce
<br>
that it was conscious.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  I reproduce here the precise discussion we had 
<br>
arrived at in the previous posts for your reference in
<br>
case it's necessary.
<br>
