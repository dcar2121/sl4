<p><em>&gt;&gt; In the words of Euler, Monsieur,

<em>&gt;&gt; (a + bn)/n = x, therefore you are wrong! 
</em><br>
<p>Supposedly this was addressed to Diderot at the court
<br>
of Catherine the Great in St. Petersburg.  The story is
<br>
that Catherine appealed to Euler to say something to
<br>
shut up Diderot and his atheism.
<br>
<p>So it was said that he approached Diderot, and when they
<br>
had Catherine's (and therefore everyone's) attention, he 
<br>
uttered the famous words, and Diderot retreated in
<br>
stark humiliation.
<br>
<p>Only Euler's words were &quot;(a + bn)/n = x, therefore God
<br>
exists. Reply, Monsieur!&quot; in the version I read. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, it's been pointed out that this is an extremely
<br>
unlikely yarn for several reasons. One is that Diderot
<br>
was the author of a French Encyclopedia (and algebra
<br>
certainly was not, in the words of the anecdote &quot;Greek to
<br>
him&quot;). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought it was e^iPI + 1 = 0 therefore God exists. 
</em><br>
<p>No, Stuart was closer. See E.T.Bell's Men of
<br>
mathematics for the classic statement of this clearly
<br>
apocryphal story.
<br>
<p>Off topic, I know, but it's a Saturday and it's fun.  :-)
