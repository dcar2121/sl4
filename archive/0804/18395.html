<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  Example: teleportation.  It works like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  I step into a booth at point A and a copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  of me is produced at point B.  The copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  at point A is slowly [tortured and killed]

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  overdose of a narcotic, making the death
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  fast and painless.
</em><br>
<p>By the way, Jeff mentioned that it would be cruel and
<br>
unethical to not pay the $2, but we get to the heart
<br>
of the problem by supposing---of course, entirely
<br>
hypothetically---that Matt (or whoever is speaking,
<br>
i.e., the subject of the query) is what I have called
<br>
an MSI (a most selfish individual). We wish to ask
<br>
what an MSI would do, and what are the logical
<br>
reasons one way or the other for his choices, given
<br>
that the MSI values existing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  But I have teleported hundreds of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  both ways and can't tell the difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  I always come out at point B and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;  would rather save the money.
</em><br>
<p>Stathis responds  (and if you respond to this, Matt, please
<br>
try to fix your line lengths so that I don't have to reformat)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The process of walking from A to B results in the copy at A painlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; vanishing from the universe and another copy appearing at B. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what ordinary survival from moment to moment is all about. So if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; form of transport such as destructive teleportation reproduces this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; process, I wouldn't worry about it. But if some new form of walking is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discovered which leaves a copy at A to be slowly crushed, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; equivalent to your non-destructive teleportation scenario, that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be worrying indeed.
</em><br>
<p>I totally concur with Stathis. However, as *perhaps*  Matt is 
<br>
saying, I dispute the probability interpretation:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This is because with two copies extant at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same time, I have a subjectively 1/2 chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of becoming either of the two. In a sense I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't really &quot;become&quot; my copy even if there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; only one of them, but I feel as if I do because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that's the way my brain has evolved to think.
</em><br>
<p>I would suggest that you *do* become both the copy and
<br>
the original. We are simply unused to believing that we 
<br>
can be in two places at the same time, that's all. If we
<br>
thinking of &quot;becoming&quot; as a physical process that is 
<br>
happening to us from moment to moment all the time,
<br>
then one becomes the ill-fated original with exactly
<br>
the same fidelity that one becomes the remote duplicate.
<br>
<p>Matt responds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, this is the same problem as the quantum coin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subjective expectation for rational agents requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple trials and counting outcomes.  If you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copied 100 times when a coin comes up heads,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then there is a subjective 99% chance of heads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because after multiple trials that is what you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most likely to remember.
</em><br>
<p>If one must use the tricky &quot;subjective probability&quot;
<br>
stuff---which I don't think we ought to resort to,
<br>
since the entire process you originally described
<br>
is from a physical point of view perfectly well-
<br>
defined---then I suppose that I agree with you
<br>
here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the case of teleportation I end up at point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B every time, independent of the method used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to kill the copy at A.
</em><br>
<p>You do nothing of the kind. According to the
<br>
very obvious physics of the situation, it's only
<br>
one particular &quot;I&quot; that you are correctly describing
<br>
here. The doomed original is just as valid an &quot;I&quot;
<br>
as is the copy. The fact is that you end up as 
<br>
both A and B, even if A is short-lived. Just
<br>
because B ends up later with some memories---
<br>
and we know from memory addition arguments
<br>
that this often means absolutely nothing---does
<br>
not imply that B is somehow a more legitimate
<br>
or true version of you than A is. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you believe you might be tortured, then that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief is based on faith rather than experience. 
</em><br>
<p>It is based upon a simple *understanding* of the
<br>
situation that is being outlined. It is not based on
<br>
faith anymore than your understanding of air 
<br>
traffic control is based on faith. If you claim to
<br>
understand air traffic control, and commend your
<br>
fate to the controllers, then you probably understand
<br>
air traffic control as well as you understand the
<br>
simple A - B scenario you outlined here. The
<br>
reasons are all very clear for what a person
<br>
ought to believe (if you ask me), and the necessary
<br>
actions that follow are (to me) equally clear. You
<br>
should pay the $2 so that you are not tortured for
<br>
such a long time (*regardless* of whether you
<br>
remember it or not).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Faith says that you are going to step into a booth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and be crushed with 100% probability,
</em><br>
<p>No, a mere objective examination of the apparatus
<br>
and the physical entity that gets trapped in it say
<br>
that you (clearly the physical entity in question
<br>
totally regardless of whatever else may be happening
<br>
at remote stations) will be crushed with 100% probability.
<br>
<p>It's important to focus upon that point. *Anyone* who
<br>
objectively assesses that some other bad thing could
<br>
happen to you (e.g. the IRS comes after you next week
<br>
say with 100% probability), and who tries to specify
<br>
exactly what that means by physics, will also come to
<br>
inescapable conclusion that Matt will be with 100%
<br>
probability crushed  (quite regardless that elsewhere
<br>
in time in space, near or far, there may be other copies
<br>
of Matt receiving other experiences).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; so you will probably pay the $2.  But after repeating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough times and always ending up at B, you will at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some point decide to save the money.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe; but you'd either have to be very broke or
<br>
be very much of a tightwad.  But that we are sometimes
<br>
inevitably led to poor decisions was explained in the
<br>
thread I started &quot;The Clock/Torture Experiment&quot;. 
<br>
And I believe therefore that it is not entirely relevant
<br>
what one &quot;eventually decides to do&quot;, because objectively,
<br>
that may be the worse outcome for one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you prefer, think of teleportation as equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to being tortured and then having the memory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the torture erased.
</em><br>
<p>It is not the same thing at all!  The you who was
<br>
being tortured, i.e. the you that existed at that
<br>
point in time, is just as much a valid you as you
<br>
are.  It would be a bad thing for you if we woke
<br>
you up every day at 3am and tortured you for
<br>
an hour, even if we managed to erase all the
<br>
memories subsequently.  It's simply clear that
<br>
under such a scenario it is objectively true that
<br>
your live (by your lights) does not go as well
<br>
for you as in the case where you are not tortured.
