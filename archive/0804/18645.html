<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Second, happiness is bounded.  There is no evidence that humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;than animals, or that the rich are happier than the poor, or that modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;humans are happier now than centuries ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is evidence for all those assertions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea how you would measure the happiness of animal?  I can tell if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dog is happy.  I have no idea if that dog is happier than I am....there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no metric I can come up with that compares tail wagging pace to the how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy that Scandinavians feel on a scale of 1 to 5; 1 being unhappy, 5 being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super happy.
</em><br>
<p>We can make some educated guesses by compairing the behaviour of
<br>
animals in the wild, with the everyday life of humans. My impression
<br>
is that modern humans spend much more of their time experiencing joy,
<br>
and a lack of fear, than animals do. But I may be wrong on this one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Funny you should mention the rich v poor thing.  Lots of stuff the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couple of weeks about how the Easterlin Hypothesis is wrong.  See here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/the-economics-of-happiness-part-4-are-rich-people-happier-than-poor-people/">http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/the-economics-of-happiness-part-4-are-rich-people-happier-than-poor-people/</a>
</em><br>
<p>I'll wait a few years, till the dust settles, and someone comes up
<br>
with a new consensus (I used to be in happiness research, and have
<br>
little trust for recent data in the field, unless heavily backed up).
<br>
But even with the Eastelin hypothesis, it's clear that the rich are
<br>
happier than the poor; the debate is whether the very rich are happier
<br>
than the rich.
<br>
<p>But the rich/poor debate is not very relevant in the face of a
<br>
singularity; the human/animal debate, on the other hand, is crucial.
<br>
The arguments of the environmental movement boil down to &quot;leave nature
<br>
alone&quot;, with some possibly minor corrections. Since our knowledge of
<br>
natural systems is poor, this is a sensible position.
<br>
<p>But after a singularity, we could do whatever we wanted with &quot;nature&quot;;
<br>
strip mine it, vary it, create all sorts of beings and plants, use it
<br>
for artistic expression, ensure that no animal suffers or dies, etc...
<br>
So the moral standing of animals is something that will have to be
<br>
tackled.
