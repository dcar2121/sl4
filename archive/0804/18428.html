<p><em>&gt; It makes little more sense to call different branches of a person the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same person than it does to call identical twins the same person.
</em><br>
<p>You may not be aware of the facts concerning identical twins.
<br>
(I wasn't for many years.) They are not in any way exchangeable
<br>
in the eyes of those who know them; they are much MUCH
<br>
less alike that you and your recently created duplicate would
<br>
be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It makes even less sense to call two copies made in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe the same person... since that would make it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awkward for them to interact and soon become an impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charade to maintain.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  If you imagine over and over again what it would
<br>
be like to have a duplicate, and if you subscribe to the idea
<br>
that you survive if any duplicate of you does, then this is the
<br>
most natural convention in the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even though I have strong opinions on what the best way is to talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this, I must admit that I find the whole subject of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity *incredibly* boring, as it has nothing to do with the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world and is--as I've mentioned--simply a language convention.
</em><br>
<p>What keeps these discussions from boiling down to being &quot;incredibly
<br>
boring&quot;, as you write, is that *actions* will depend on our views.
<br>
The main point is to properly prescribe actions. The chief such
<br>
action that you have to decide (or will have to decide when uploaded),
<br>
(and need to decide now if you want to be philosophically prepared
<br>
for all eventualities) can be seen from this following example:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exact molecular duplicate of you was created
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ten minutes ago and lies in the next room frozen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a cask of ice. On top the cask of ice is a briefcase
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;containing $10M dollars. The choice facing you (the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version, instance, who is now breathing and conscious)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is (A) to undergo disintegration, in which your ten-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minute-ago duplicate is resurrected and the money
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes his (i.e. in my view, yours), or whether the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frozen copy in the other room is disintegrated (along
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the $10M).
<br>
<p>Please tell me what you would do in this situation.  If you make the
<br>
sensible decision, then yes, we are only arguing terminology. But
<br>
if you don't, then analogous situations will arise for you provided
<br>
that you are so lucky as to survive this century or be uploaded.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The bottom line is, you've chosen a poor convention, and I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chosen a much better one.  There's really not much more I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say about it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes you *can* say more about it. You can prescribe *actions*
<br>
you would take.  Then we'll see which is the better and which
<br>
the worse speaking convention.
<br>
<p>Lee
