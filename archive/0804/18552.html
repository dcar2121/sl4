<em>&gt; How is it that wild tech advances leave people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working harder and for less pay? Because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra value is being siphoned off for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employers. The logical end, as Bill Joy pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out, is that the boss gets what he wants from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines and the rest of humanity is expendable.
</em><br>
<p>True, but it's not a foregone conclusion.  Hopefully you've read Manna by Marshall Brain (<a href="http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm">http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm</a>).  Anyone who hasn't on this list needs to go do so immediately.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For a different idea on what to do, Robert Anton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wilson's 1979 novel _The Homing Pigeons_ (book 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of _Schrodinger's Cat_) proposes something called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the R.I.C.H. economy: Rising Income through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cybernetic Homeostasis. Basically, guaranteed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good pay for those replaced by a machine, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good bounty for inventing yourself out of a job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He anticipated many, many things discussed here.
</em><br>
<p>I think I've read that -- many years ago.  I should go see if it is on my bookshelf and pull it off and re-read it.  Thank you for the reference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having said that, this is the sort of debate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes utterly moot with FAI.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sanguine about that.  There is still likely to be a transition period that may not be all roses (particularly if you believe in a slow/soft take-off).
