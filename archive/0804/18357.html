<p><em>&gt; For the duration of this thread, assume that FAI is the best use of

</em><br>
<p>Aren't we jumping ahead?  We have yet to solve the very non-trivial problem of
<br>
defining what &quot;friendly&quot; means.
<br>
<p>I am aware of CEV, but this is a &quot;human-centered&quot; definition.  What happens
<br>
when the boundary between human and non-human becomes fuzzy?  Should AI be
<br>
friendly to robots, uploads, humans with altered or programmable goals,
<br>
copies, potential copies, animals with augmented brains, human-machine hybrids
<br>
in all their millions of variations, distributed or collective intelligences? 
<br>
If so, how?  If an entity wants to be put in a degenerate state of bliss, or
<br>
die, or have its memory erased or programmed randomly, should an AI comply? 
<br>
Such questions only seem to lead to endless debate with no resolution.  How
<br>
can we ask what we will want when we don't know who &quot;we&quot; will be?
<br>
<p>I prefer the approach of asking &quot;what WILL we do?&quot; because &quot;what SHOULD we
<br>
do?&quot; implies a goal relative to some intelligence whose existence we can't
<br>
predict. We implicitly assume this intelligence to be human, but that doesn't
<br>
make sense in a posthuman world.
<br>
<p>I believe AI will emerge in distributed form on the internet, a hybrid of
<br>
carbon and silicon based intelligence.  I proposed
<br>
<a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/agi.html">http://www.mattmahoney.net/agi.html</a> as a starting point: a protocol in which
<br>
peers compete to be useful to humans.  Initially it will be what many consider
<br>
to be friendly, although not in the sense of CEV.  Peers are rewarded with
<br>
resources for satisfying immediate human goals, not our extrapolated volition.
<br>
&nbsp;Competition for resources is a stable goal under recursive self improvement,
<br>
but this competition can also lead to cheating, stealing, formation of
<br>
alliances and war.  Also, I believe that when the balance of computation
<br>
shifts to silicon, that the protocol will shift from natural language to
<br>
something incomprehensible and humans will be left behind.
<br>
<p>These are the types of problems we need to study, but not with the goal of
<br>
achieving a particular outcome.
