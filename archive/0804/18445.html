<em>&gt;  The fact that AGi ethics is incredibly badly understood right now, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the only clear route to understand it better is to make more empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  progress toward AGI.   I find it unlikely that dramatic advances in AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ethical theory are going to be made in a vacuum, separate from
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>For any of the many people who agree with Ben's sentiment:
<br>
<p>Large numbers of people have made various AI advances in the past. In
<br>
none of these cases, to my knowledge, have FAI people said, &quot;a-ha,
<br>
that's one of the pieces of data I was waiting for, this advances FAI
<br>
theory.&quot; Why would we expect this to change in the future? At the very
<br>
least, doesn't this show that even if FAI advances require AGI
<br>
advances, the &quot;bottleneck&quot; is that there are too few people working on
<br>
deriving FAI from existing AGI, rather than too few people working on
<br>
existing AGI?
<br>
<p>Are there specific facts about AGI that you're waiting to find out,
<br>
such that if the result of a pending experiment is A, then successful
<br>
FAI theory lies in one direction, but if the result is B, then
<br>
successful FAI theory lies in a different direction? If so, what are
<br>
such facts?
<br>
<p>At what point will you know that AGI has advanced enough that FAI can proceed?
<br>
<p>For SIAI specifically: how is OpenCog going to be &quot;coupled&quot; to
<br>
&quot;dramatic advances in AGI ethical theory&quot;?
