From: Jeff Herrlich &lt;<a href="mailto:jeff_herrlich@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Can't%20afford%20to%20resuce%20cows%20(was%20Re:%20Arbitrarily%20decide%20who%20benefits)">jeff_herrlich@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;Why not make the beneficiaries all sentient/conscious beings? The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionarily designed aspect of selfishness, may be a bit of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem. [Not that I'm beyond selfishness, on occassion -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unfortunately].
</em><br>
<p>The choice of jargon here sounds suspiciously like an attempt to
<br>
implement Mahayana Buddhism.  Cool!
<br>
<p>I think I know how to deal with selfishness.  There's two types:
<br>
<p>* Simply not caring about the other person.  For example, I want me to
<br>
be fed but I don't care much whether you get fed.  If the AI cares
<br>
about me, and about you, it will tend to try to get both of us fed.
<br>
Hunger provides more-than-linear motivation as you get hungrier, and
<br>
it's likely to figure this out and feed us until we're about equally
<br>
hungry, assuming it cares about us equally.  This is relatively simple.
<br>
<p>* Wanting higher status than the other person.  For example, I want a
<br>
bigger car than you, and if you get a bigger car I'll be less happy.
<br>
To cope with this, the AI has separate parameters for respect and
<br>
compassion.  The AI's respect is its desire to avoid doing harm to
<br>
others (as compared to what would happen to them if the AI took no
<br>
action), and compassion is the desire to benefit others.  The trick is
<br>
to tune the respect parameters so the AI doesn't get involved in
<br>
trivial conflicts (such as our car-buying contest) but it does get
<br>
involved to prevent violent crime (you don't want respect from the
<br>
mugger-to-be to stop it from taking his gun as he's travelling toward
<br>
a forseeable mugging).  More pesky parameters to arbitrarily decide.  :-(.
<br>
<p>But on to &quot;sentient/conscious&quot;... 
<br>
<p>The dictionary I looked at defined &quot;sentient&quot; to mean &quot;conscious&quot;, so
<br>
there's only one word there to wonder about.  I'm not sure I have a
<br>
definition of &quot;conscious&quot; that I'd be willing to try to implement.
<br>
<p>But nevermind that, I'm too conflict-averse to make the attempt.  The
<br>
Buddhists say cows (and other mammals) are conscious.  If humans eat
<br>
cows, and my AI is influenced more by empathy for sentient beings than
<br>
by respect for cow butcherers, it will try to stop the cows from being
<br>
eaten.  But the problem is that the humans have guns and will start
<br>
shooting at the AI (or its implementor) if it stops them from kiling
<br>
and eating cows.  In contrast, the cows do not have guns.  So trying
<br>
to save the cows would make the AI (and its implementor) targets for
<br>
no political benefit.
<br>
<p>So no Buddhism implementation from me today.
<br>
<p>I think we need some natural balance between political expediency and
<br>
some fuzzy idea of consensus morality.  Maybe if it looks human and
<br>
passes some genetic test for being human, we let it benefit, then once
<br>
someone figures out to create the aforementioned brain-damaged horde
<br>
to manipulate the AI we retroactively fix the population of
<br>
beneficiaries to be the set of humans in existence before the
<br>
horde-creation began.  Leave the issue of how to deal with uploads
<br>
until later.
