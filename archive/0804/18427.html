<p><p><em>&gt; ... my point was, at least teleportation where the original is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantaneously destroyed should be uncontroversial, being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more or less equivalent to walking.
</em><br>
<p>That has to be correct.  Entirely correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Strange things happen when we grapple with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weird duplication scenarios using brains that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved to believe absolutely that there can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever be one copy of us travelling forward through time.
</em><br>
<p>But we &quot;have been evolved&quot; to believe all sorts of
<br>
nonsense. We have been evolved to believe that
<br>
for every inside there must be an outside. We have
<br>
been evolved to believe that *down* is a particular
<br>
universal direction in 3D space. The list is endless.
<br>
<p>*But* we have also evolved the means to reason
<br>
past such &quot;evolved beliefs&quot;, and especially with the
<br>
help of certain memes, we should not only do so,
<br>
but we should completely embrace the results!
<br>
Therefore we *ought to* and *must* believe that
<br>
a certain speed (the speed of light) cannot be
<br>
exceeded, that a certain temperature cannot be
<br>
lowered, and so on and on.
<br>
<p>Yes, we may have, as you write &quot;been evolved to
<br>
believe absolutely [sic] that ther ean only ever be
<br>
one copy of us travleing forward through time&quot;,
<br>
but our reason and logic shows that to be utterly
<br>
false. So, just as in QM and relativity theory, we
<br>
simply have to GET USED to it.
