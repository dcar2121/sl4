<p><em>&gt;  Example: teleportation.  It works like this.  I step into a booth at point A

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  painfully killed by being crushed between the soundproofed walls of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  teleportation booth in a process that takes 24 hours.  For $2 extra I have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  option of having the copy at point A injected with an overdose of a narcotic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  making the death fast and painless.  But I have teleported hundreds of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  both ways and can't tell the difference.  I always come out at point B and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would rather save the money.
</em><br>
<p>The process of walking from A to B results in the copy at A painlessly
<br>
vanishing from the universe and another copy appearing at B. This is
<br>
what ordinary survival from moment to moment is all about. So if a
<br>
form of transport such as destructive teleportation reproduces this
<br>
process, I wouldn't worry about it. But if some new form of walking is
<br>
discovered which leaves a copy at A to be slowly crushed, which is
<br>
equivalent to your non-destructive teleportation scenario, that would
<br>
be worrying indeed. This is because with two copies extant at the same
<br>
time, I have a subjectively 1/2 chance of becoming either of the two.
<br>
In a sense I don't really &quot;become&quot; my copy even if there's only one of
<br>
them, but I feel as if I do because that's the way my brain has
<br>
evolved to think.
