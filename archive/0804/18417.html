</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns for whether or not someone you don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Africa gets tortured, you clearly are not selfish in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; was completely indifferent to the African's suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;selfish&quot;, then your use of terms would be at variance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with other speakers of English.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have concerns for those I don't know in the general sense of wishing all
<br>
humans to be treated with at least what I consider minimum standards.   But
<br>
while I generally have this wish for all it is not my personal high
<br>
concern.   Personally I don't believe it has anything to do with being
<br>
&quot;selfish&quot; or not and I think that is sloppy use of loaded terminology.   I
<br>
personally could care less whether you label me &quot;selfish&quot; or not as I
<br>
consider many things labeled &quot;selfish&quot; by some as being quite sane and
<br>
reasonable.  Labeling &quot;selfish&quot; is used to coerce weak minds afraid of mere
<br>
labels.   It is a name calling game for children.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  It all depends on which future copies of you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you regard as your &quot;future self&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is purely a language convention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But surely you don't really believe that it's only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of &quot;language convention&quot;. Suppose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gestapo arrived at your doorstep and proceeded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to set up the apparatus to torture you, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colonel in charge had a philosophic turn of mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he might say, &quot;You really should not appear so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apprehensive Mr. Jones---it's purely a language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convention as to whether you or someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going to shortly undergo suffering.&quot;  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really expect us to believe that it's identically the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same to you whether they do it to you or do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some random African?  You really don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is a fact of the matter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I hear that.  It would certainly make a difference to me.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To add on, suppose that you love X, and right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before an extremely painful operation, you express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathy for X and tell her so. Would you be lying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you then added &quot;of course, whether it's you who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergoes the pain or some random African is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually indifferent to me&quot;?  Or would that be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth (however hurtful the statement itself might be)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  To add to Matt's original thought experiment, here is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a chain of related thought experiments I find interesting:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. Is it ethical to use a &quot;date rape&quot; drug on someone who isn't going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to remember much in the morning, but will be unable to resist your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advances during the night?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say that it is not, because whether or not an individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remembers something is immaterial to the physical reality of whether or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not it happened to him or her.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Of course it is not ethical.  It is direct physical force merely to get your
<br>
rocks off and befuddling of another's mind and ability to choose to boot.
<br>
That is as unethical as it gets.  It is also obviously a sign of utter
<br>
self-contempt and contempt for the &quot;object of your intentions&quot;.   I am much
<br>
too &quot;selfish&quot; for that.  I want the person I want to want me to and remember
<br>
everything about the event fondly.   I can't imagine thinking I could gain
<br>
anything I want by such behavior.
<br>
<p>Even if I want to degrade someone I would want them to remember that also.
<br>
Otherwise, whatever is the point?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  2.  Is it ethical to rape someone and then erase their memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely (or fix them afterwards so that they believe it never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; happened, or they have a blackout)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Likewise, it is not ethical (by which, as I have said, I mean little more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than &quot;I disapprove&quot; or &quot;we customarily disapprove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or we should disapprove&quot;).
</em><br>
<p><p>I mean a great deal more than that.  To force the  will of another
<br>
intelligent being in such a brutish fashion makes one obviously unfit for
<br>
society.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  3.  Is it ethical to torture someone and then erase their memories of it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Likewise.  While it's bad to *add* memories of having been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured, it is much worse to actually torture someone (leaving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their memories as usual).
</em><br>
<p><p>They are both so despicable I refuse to enter a pointless argument as to
<br>
whether one is worse than the other.
<br>
<p>5.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;don't worry, I've made a backup of your brain and I will use it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make an exact copy of you on my home planet, as soon as I figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how to do so... which should only take a few years.  I'm not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; torture your copy when it wakes up, so it's fine if I torture you now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In fact, I'm going to kill you soon so it won't matter at all.  Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copy won't remember any of this.&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturally, that would be terrible. The proper way to look at it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to integrate (or, trying to be less fancy, *sum*) over all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instances of your runtime, and try to evaluate preferences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>WHAT??  I don't need to sum over any instances to condemn such behavior
<br>
toward or by any and all of my instances.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  6.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;don't worry I've *already* made a copy of you, so you are redundant&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 7.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing you and then said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;don't worry, I've already made a copy of you *and* I'm going to erase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your memories soon, so you won't be you at all but the copy will be.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 8.  Would you be fine with such torture happening to you, as long as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copy was made somewhere else, and as long as you consented to it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beforehand?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think number 8 is essentially the question that Matt is asking...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that I agree entirely with you and the point you're making here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but I don't really see how 8 is different from 7, 7 is different from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 6, etc.  I would answer &quot;no&quot; to all of these for the same reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Being tortured would upset me... I wouldn't want anyone to do it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me, and I wouldn't want to do it to anyone else (including my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;original&quot; future self) regardless of how many copies of me were made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and when.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree completely.  But our point of view implies, at least to me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we regard all our copies equally, on the same ontological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; footing as it were. &quot;Bad runtime&quot; + &quot;good runtime&quot; is either bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or good depending on which of the two is greater quantitatively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Is this really about ethics or some mad guess about some hypothetical
<br>
future where nothing  really matters because we are all redundantly backed
<br>
up and no one really  dies real death or suffers real suffering?   Is it all
<br>
just &quot;experience&quot;?    Do we fall into techno- solipsism?
<br>
<p>Selfish?  Just pop us back into the VR for a few thousand lifetimes worth of
<br>
&quot;experience&quot; until we grow out it.  Instant Karma is going to get you!
