<p>Would you continue to say this no matter how differentiated your

copies became?  (In other words, no matter how long the time period
<br>
was?)  If so, then I think we have stumbled upon a real-world
<br>
difference between our opinions.  So maybe it's not just an issue of
<br>
language after all :)
<br>
<p>Consider this scenario:  you get copied, and your copy moves to
<br>
another country.  You both live out your lives for the next 10 years.
<br>
Your copy falls in love with a woman in the other country and gets
<br>
married, has 2 kids.  You get a degree in biology, and start your own
<br>
company but remain single.  You show up on his doorstep one day and
<br>
say &quot;hey... I was wondering if you could disintegrate yourself.  I was
<br>
promised a lot of money if you will do it.&quot;  He says &quot;no way... my
<br>
wife and kids need a father and would be very upset.  I love them very
<br>
much.  If anyone is going to disintegrate, it's got to be you.&quot;  You
<br>
argue that you have a business to run, and a lot more &quot;value&quot; to
<br>
society having a technical degree.  How would you ever resolve the
<br>
argument?  You both have very different lives and different interests.
