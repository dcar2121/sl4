</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;So if you have the right to choose whether or not to work, you can choose

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;work and get money in exchange. If you deny this, then you're denying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;your future choices are yours to make, which seems radical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sorry, I can't distinguish that from word salad.  My nine month
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old son makes choices and has no conception of property rights.  So a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world without property rights is surely compatible with making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices.  I don't know what it means to make a future choice; all I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; be &quot;yours&quot; to make if we are trying to figure out exactly what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights mean?  I can't see any traction for trying to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of what you said.
</em><br>
<p><p>Property rights are an abstraction that describes how people behave, so the
<br>
fact that your son doesn't understand them won't make them go away.
<br>
<p>'Future choice' refers to a choice in the future. For example, if you had no
<br>
property rights now, and someone offered you $5 to mow their lawn, you could
<br>
get that $5 of property by committing to a particular action. If you're
<br>
incapable of making commitments regarding the future, it would be hard to
<br>
have property rights, though.
<br>
<p>I have already argued that property rights are an abstraction covering
<br>
certain kinds of agreements. If you and I agree that you have the right to
<br>
use, move, sell, or destroy a particular object, we can claim that you 'own'
<br>
it as the word 'own' is presently used. This 'owner'ship is really the
<br>
ownership of specific rights regarding the object, and those rights are just
<br>
collections of implicit agreements mediated by a judicial system -- they
<br>
recognize your 'ownership' by punishing people who attempt to use, move,
<br>
sell, or destroy the object without your consent. So it all compiles down to
<br>
mutual agreements; the abstraction just makes it easy to talk about. If you
<br>
want, we can go ahead and use the non-abstract version: instead of saying
<br>
that I 'own' this computer, I can try to list all the people who are not
<br>
allowed to type on it, not allowed to move it to their homes, not allowed to
<br>
incinerate it, etc. But that sounds like a clumsy way to do things.
<br>
<p>Of course, if you don't believe in such agreements, we can't have property
<br>
rights as I think of them. But it seems like a pretty elementary part of
<br>
human behavior to make promises about the future. If we can't do that, we
<br>
can't have governments, and most forms of anarchism won't work, either. I
<br>
guess we'd be stuck with Stirner.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In practice, hunger trumps all of those abstract concepts you're using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there.  I'm sure that even if I were completely incompetent to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything but beg for food, I'd be doing that if I was hungry enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least 95% of everyone else is the same.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm sorry, but playing the &quot;Examples are more concrete than principles&quot; card
<br>
doesn't work. It is true that, when some people are hungry, they care more
<br>
about dealing with their hunger than adhering to their moral system or
<br>
maintaining the order of whatever society they exist in. That doesn't
<br>
justify their behavior. It's a diagnosis, not a defense. In any case, the
<br>
two outcomes I mentioned are valid: either someone can produce the value
<br>
that justifies their cost, in which case this is an execution problem that
<br>
should get easier with more advanced intelligences, *or* the person isn't
<br>
worth the expense of keeping them around, in which case -- like everyone
<br>
else who eventually is unable to sustain their own existence even though
<br>
with more resources they could -- they die.
<br>
<p>When you hear about someone being hungry, do you assume that they are a)
<br>
worth something, and thus that it is a tragedy that they can't go on living
<br>
and producing for their community, or b) that they are not worth the food
<br>
they eat, the air they breath, the space they take up, etc., that it is thus
<br>
natural that they would expire, but that it is somehow not righteous to let
<br>
this happen? If a), you are introducing force and rights-violation to solve
<br>
a problem that can be solved peacefully without violating anyone's promises
<br>
or obligations. If b), I'm not sure you have an argument.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Right.  Specify what a common rights-protocol would look like, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this conversation will be worthwhile.  Hutter's AIXI paper gives an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of using inductive inference to write a nontrivial algorithm;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you might want to start there.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm starting the AIXI paper right now. But while I do that, I have to ask
<br>
what sort of model you're using for an intelligence if it cannot commit in
<br>
advance to preferring a given outcome or choice, especially in the context
<br>
of being rewarded or punished for choices. As long as you have entities
<br>
capable of both of these, and with preferences for outcomes, you can end up
<br>
with property rights as discussed above. In fact, the ingredients might boil
<br>
down to: a utility function, an ability to make choices, and an ability to
<br>
make decisions in the present affecting choices in the future.
<br>
<p>It's obviously possible to contrive circumstances where this is the
<br>
<em>&gt; case.  There are emergency situations where it's pretty commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreed that taking something and offering to pay something reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for it after the fact is a reasonable thing to do.
</em><br>
<p><p>You are suddenly bringing up a whole different issue! This has been
<br>
discussed at length in a number of works on market-based law. I would
<br>
recommend David Friedman's *Law's Order* in particular as a good overview.
<br>
Essentially, that would be up to the rights-enforcing agents, but usually
<br>
these rights are enforced via a torts system. Perhaps when I do $10 of
<br>
damages, I can make good on the harm I caused and the surprise and
<br>
inconvenience by paying your lawyer/enforcement fees, plus thrice the damage
<br>
I caused. Ending up paying $1500 for stealing a meal I had to steal in order
<br>
to stay alive is a pretty good deal, frankly. Would the AI allow it? Even if
<br>
I had to go to prison for that theft, expected lifespan - prison term &gt;
<br>
lifespan given no more food. Probably.
<br>
<p>People will probably prefer a rights-enforcing organization that makes
<br>
allowances for such extraordinary circumstances. In that case, your right to
<br>
the meal would not quite be outright ownership -- in financial parlance (the
<br>
easiest, since they've been formalizing this stuff for hundreds of years)
<br>
you have ownership, but are short a call option exercisable by someone in
<br>
extremely desperate circumstances, who transfers a large debt to you in
<br>
exchange for immediate food. Once you think of it that way, it's a lot
<br>
easier not to get worked up about it -- yeah, the AI might not care too much
<br>
that you miss a meal and have to order in, but only because in the contract
<br>
you signed, you agreed that a large fine was more than enough to make up for
<br>
this inconvenience.
<br>
<p>A world that worked that way might sound a little more brutal, but that's
<br>
only because it is a lot more honest. Organizations that guarantee property
<br>
rights, rather than 'human rights', don't fall into the trap of having
<br>
conflicting supergoals, and of continuing to make an investment in the wrong
<br>
things when their marginal utility approaches zero. If you're going by vague
<br>
ephemera, whereby 'hunger' out of context (a strung-out drug addict who
<br>
spent his last $10 on a dimebag?) trumps 'wealth' out of context (someone
<br>
providing jobs -- and thus meals -- for hundreds of people?).
<br>
<p>I would be really interested in how you would formalize your views. What
<br>
principles do you start with to derive not-property-rights from the very
<br>
small set of pretty fundamental attributes I argued would automatically lead
<br>
to such rights?
