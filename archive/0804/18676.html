</em><br>
<p>My abstract self is neutral about being shot, which my emotional self
<br>
finds disturbing.
<br>
<p>My emotional self cannot think at SL4.  (I hope I am using the terms
<br>
correctly).  Emotions are the axioms of beliefs.  The ideal abstract
<br>
self that I would use to think at SL4 would have no biases or emotions.
<br>
&nbsp;It would think in a mathematics with no axioms, where everything is
<br>
wrong, even the questions are wrong.  I can plug in some assumptions
<br>
and draw conclusions, but this does not make them right.
<br>
<p>At SL3 we want to avoid an AI that tiles the solar system with
<br>
paperclips.  That would be bad.  At SL4, I imagine how a paperclip
<br>
making nanobot would feel.  Making paperclips has positive utility for
<br>
them.  There would be no other intelligences, so therefore it would be
<br>
utopia.
<br>
<p>What about the humans?  At SL3, humans would be extinct.  That would be
<br>
bad.  We could upload, but the paperclip makers would kill us to take
<br>
over our computing resources.  That would also be bad.
<br>
<p>At SL4, an upload would produce an entity with your memories that
<br>
claims to be you.  That is all you can say about it.  It is irrelevant
<br>
whether you consciousness transfers because qualia is not an observable
<br>
phenomena.  Furthermore, if your memories were altered, you would not
<br>
know the difference.  Finally, if you found joy in moving atoms one at
<br>
a time to make paperclips, you would be happy.  Therefore, tiling the
<br>
solar system with paperclips is a good outcome for some definitions of
<br>
&quot;you&quot; and some definitions of &quot;good&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sorry, there is no right answer because there are no axioms.
