<em>&gt;But nevermind that, I'm too conflict-averse to make the attempt.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Buddhists say cows (and other mammals) are conscious.  If humans eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cows, and my AI is influenced more by empathy for sentient beings than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by respect for cow butcherers, it will try to stop the cows from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eaten.  But the problem is that the humans have guns and will start
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shooting at the AI (or its implementor) if it stops them from kiling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and eating cows.  In contrast, the cows do not have guns.  So trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to save the cows would make the AI (and its implementor) targets for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no political benefit.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Conflict aversion seems like a poor reason for excluding cows from your
<br>
AI's utility function.
<br>
&nbsp;I'm rather apathetic about whether cows are included in your utility
<br>
function, but CEV comes closer than your approach to capturing what I
<br>
want an AI to do.
<br>
&nbsp;A conflict aversion strategy may be exploitable, in that it appears to
<br>
encourage people to threaten conflict in order to influence your choice
<br>
of a utility function (in this case, encouraging PETA types to convince you
<br>
they're more willing and able to endanger your AI than they would be if
<br>
you committed to ignoring such threats).
<br>
&nbsp;Any well designed AI ought to be able to derive an appropriate level of
<br>
conflict aversion from a utility function that contains no explicit
<br>
conflict aversion.

<em>&gt;No, I didn't ask that and am not interested in that.  We want what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want.  So far as I can tell, talk about what we should want just leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to hypocrisy.  People say they should want things that sound nice but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are entirely unconnected with what they do want, and there's no way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;form a connection, so it's just hot air.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't see what you claim to see. I see a lot of hypocrisy related to
<br>
wants, but I don't see hypocrisy that is better explained by problems
<br>
associated with &quot;wanting to want&quot; than it is by conflicts associated with
<br>
what we currently want.
<br>
&nbsp;What I want seems to include a desire to alter some of my current wants
<br>
(e.g. I want to eliminate any logical inconsistencies that may exist in
<br>
my current set of wants), so you appear to be excluding some of my wants
<br>
from your AI's utility function.
