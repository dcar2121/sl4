<p><em>&gt; So where does self begin and end?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Despite sounding like some kind of koan, should a baby learn that its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; room is part of its self?  Should the presence or absence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caregivers be included in the definition of self?  Is the child's
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; self?
</em><br>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, my wife and kids are part of myself.
<br>
<p>They are as autonomous as my subconscious and physically separate but as far as values, goals, choices and ethics are concerned, they are me.
<br>
<p>Oh -- and just to be clear -- I generally override their choices about as frequently as I'm stupid enough to override my subconscious (i.e. it's virtually always a negotiation ;-).
<br>
<p>Ever consider that the world would be a much better place if we didn't have such a clear belief as to where self ends?
<br>
<p>I believe very strongly in being selfish -- it's just common-sense rationality . . . . It's just that I also believe that self should be extended as far as possible.
