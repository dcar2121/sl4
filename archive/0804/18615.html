<em>&gt; &gt; What is interesting about a &quot;super AI&quot; is that it could run an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efficient command economy. And it could run it in ways that minimise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the negative philosophical consequences to people. Would we want that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It can do so iff people can express demand curves. If it knows I will buy 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apples at $1 each, it has enough information to manage the status quo (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the market can do just fine already). What it needs to know is how I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; react to apples at $2 or $4 -- and that's not even getting into how I react
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when oranges fluctuate, too. A partial solution is for all of us to start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ceding control of our small purchases to automated agents that will, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, order more of stuff we like when it's cheap, hedge against the risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of huge price increases, etc. I imagine that this will happen with fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first -- I suspect that most drives would prefer using derivatives to get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flat price for gas to paying a fluctuating price at the pump.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with this is that the AI is suddenly redundant. The information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it gets from the agent transactions is already being used by the agents to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplish the same goals as the AI. All it can do to make things run better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to create central clearinghouses for this information. And why would we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need an AI to know that collecting this information and managing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transactions would be a great business. All one has to do is look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current market value of the NYSE or CME or NASDAQ (the companies running the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchanges, not the products traded on them) to know that this is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly profitable business.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but an AI could incorporate externalities, and probably
<br>
out-perform the market (real markets are not pareto-efficient, and
<br>
even when they are approximately so, there may be non-local peaks that
<br>
AI's could move to).
<br>
<p>But agreed - the AI would have to be monstrously beyond us to run the
<br>
whole economy. But it is possible that a 90% AI run-10% free market
<br>
(or some other proportions) would turn out to be the most efficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when there is a *collection* of AIs
</em><br>
<p>This gets interesting, but scary for humans. The law of comparative
<br>
advantage does not work when there are scarce resources involved; even
<br>
if uploaded, we would probably consume much more resources than the
<br>
AI's would find useful. If there are competitive AI's, then we may be
<br>
deemed expendable...
