</em><br>
<p>My utility function can be described using Maslow's hierarchy of needs, like
<br>
most other humans.  It has been well tested by evolution.  But really, this is
<br>
the wrong question, as I discuss in
<br>
<a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/singularity.html">http://www.mattmahoney.net/singularity.html</a>
<br>
<p>The reason is that we don't get to design AI.  The value of AI is the value of
<br>
the human labor it replaces, US $2 to $5 quadrillion over the next 30 years. 
<br>
We should not expect it to cost orders of magnitude less to build, as AI
<br>
researchers have believed for the last 50 years.
<br>
<p>It is not enough just to build a human brain, solve language, vision,
<br>
robotics, etc.  AI researchers have argued that once you build a brain and
<br>
educate it, you can make billions of copies very cheaply.  But it does not
<br>
work that way.  Humans form organizations to solve problems that they cannot
<br>
solve individually.  Organizations are more efficient because each member has
<br>
a specialized task.  Each member has to be trained individually.  That is the
<br>
expensive part.  Software and training do not obey Moore's law.  Until we
<br>
achieve AI, humans have to do this training (correcting their inevitable
<br>
mistakes) if we want them to do what we want.  (After AI, the question will be
<br>
whether you trust the machines to do it.)
<br>
<p>Maybe you have noticed that the internet is getting smarter.  Maybe not.  It
<br>
is happening slowly.  What is happening is that billions of brains and
<br>
billions of computers are getting better at communicating with each other.  It
<br>
becomes easier to find other people or machines that share your interests or
<br>
have related knowledge.  It is easier to specialize.  The internet is starting
<br>
to act like a collective, general intelligence.  I have proposed a protocol in
<br>
<a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/agi.html">http://www.mattmahoney.net/agi.html</a> to make this happen.  Even if it is not
<br>
adopted in this form, I believe it will happen in some form because there is a
<br>
huge economic demand for it.  It could end up being a lot messier, maybe with
<br>
thousands of partially incompatible protocols, but ultimately the goal of
<br>
improved communication between billions of narrowly focused experts will be
<br>
achieved.  THAT is AI.
<br>
<p>I believe the friendliness problem needs to be studied in this context (as a
<br>
forecast) rather than as an engineering problem.  When most of the computing
<br>
power on the internet is carbon based, there is an economic incentive to
<br>
attach specialists that serve the interests of humans.  Machines compete for
<br>
human attention in a market where information has negative value.  When the
<br>
balance of power shifts to silicon, machines will compete more for the
<br>
attention (and computing resources) of other machines.  What I believe will
<br>
happen in the architecture I described is that the language between peers will
<br>
shift from natural language to something incomprehensible.  We will no longer
<br>
know what our computers are doing.  The singularity will then be imminent.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately this is not a problem I know how to solve.  I do not even know
<br>
if it is a problem.  If humans are not the dominant form of intelligence, then
<br>
whose opinion really matters?
