<em>&gt; &gt; If you prefer, think of teleportation as equivalent to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tortured and then having the memory of the torture erased.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has zero utility to a rational agent because there is no change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in mental state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this isn't a question about rational utility, it's a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about ethics.  In my opinion, it's unethical to torture people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of whether that fits with what you're calling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rational&quot; strategy.  In other words, if I get $1000 for torturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random person in African, and only $1 for not torturing them... you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might say that rationally, I should chose the $1000.  But that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be unethical.
</em><br>
<p>I wish to separate the question &quot;what is ethical?&quot; from the question
<br>
&quot;what will people decide is ethical?&quot;.  I am interested in the second
<br>
question.  For example, with regard to Pascal's Mugging (will you pay
<br>
$5 for a tiny chance of preventing 3^^^^3 deaths?), this has been
<br>
answered:
<br>
<p>&quot;A man cares more about a mole on his back than a million starving
<br>
people in China&quot; -- Dale Carnegie.
<br>
<p>&quot;One death is a tragedy.  A million is a statistic&quot; -- Josef Stalin.
<br>
<p>If ethics scaled linearly with utility, I would pay the $5.  But in
<br>
practice it doesn't and I won't.
<br>
<p>This nonlinearity explains, e.g. why we are outraged when a famous
<br>
football player promotes dog fighting, but we are indifferent to the
<br>
suffering of billions of chickens raised in tiny cages.  We can't
<br>
understand how the Holocaust could have happened, while genocide still
<br>
occurs under our noses.  Let me rephrase your question.  There are
<br>
millions of Africans being tortured today (e.g. war, child slavery,
<br>
disease, soldiers cutting off the limbs of the children of their
<br>
enemies in Sierra Leone).  Would you pay $1000 to prevent the torture
<br>
of one of them?
<br>
<p>So yes, you can argue that it is unethical to torture copy A in a
<br>
teleporter, or to torture someone and then erase their memory of it. 
<br>
These beliefs are important in forecasting the outcome of a
<br>
singularity. They govern what kind of laws we will pass, what kind of
<br>
machines we will build.  But don't confuse the question &quot;what should we
<br>
do?&quot; with the question &quot;what will we do?&quot;  Only the second question is
<br>
relevant to the forecast.
