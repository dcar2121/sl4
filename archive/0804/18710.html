<em>&gt; If I understand you right, this does not include my CD (that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music) collection, since that has essentially no connection to my self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or right to exist.  I agree that my self and right to exist are good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things to preserve, and likewise yours too.  However, the normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning of property rights seems to imply that I get to keep my CD
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection unless I voluntarily transfer it elsewhere, but I don't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how your argument is getting there.

<p>From: &quot;Byrne Hobart&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bhobart@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Property%20rights%20(was%20Re:%20Can't%20afford%20to%20rescue%20cows)">bhobart@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;If we have the right to make our future choices, then we can have the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make choice A in exchange for something that we can use to acquire CDs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So if you have the right to choose whether or not to work, you can choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work and get money in exchange. If you deny this, then you're denying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your future choices are yours to make, which seems radical.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, I can't distinguish that from word salad.  My nine month
<br>
old son makes choices and has no conception of property rights.  So a
<br>
world without property rights is surely compatible with making
<br>
choices.  I don't know what it means to make a future choice; all I
<br>
can do is make a choice right now.  What does it mean for a right to
<br>
be &quot;yours&quot; to make if we are trying to figure out exactly what
<br>
property rights mean?  I can't see any traction for trying to make
<br>
sense of what you said.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Byrne Hobart&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bhobart@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Property%20rights%20(was%20Re:%20Can't%20afford%20to%20rescue%20cows)">bhobart@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;If you can't find anyone who would be willing to lend you money for food,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even at an extremely high interest rate, it's confusing as to why you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you should go on existing, if 1) nobody else thinks you're worth keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around, and 2) you haven't even been able to keep yourself going.
</em><br>
<p>In practice, hunger trumps all of those abstract concepts you're using
<br>
there.  I'm sure that even if I were completely incompetent to do
<br>
anything but beg for food, I'd be doing that if I was hungry enough.
<br>
At least 95% of everyone else is the same.
<br>
<p>At this point I'm wondering what species you're in.  I suppose you're
<br>
trolling, and I'll stop responding to you in the absence of obvious
<br>
improvements in your arguments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;An AI that adhered to a common rights-protocol would have an answer;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an AI that didn't adhere would, in the eyes of other entities, be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;frequently guilty of theft and thus probably punished.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  Specify what a common rights-protocol would look like, and
<br>
this conversation will be worthwhile.  Hutter's AIXI paper gives an
<br>
example of using inductive inference to write a nontrivial algorithm;
<br>
you might want to start there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why is feeding a hungry guy predicated on violating property rights?
</em><br>
<p>It's obviously possible to contrive circumstances where this is the
<br>
case.  There are emergency situations where it's pretty commonly
<br>
agreed that taking something and offering to pay something reasonable
<br>
for it after the fact is a reasonable thing to do.  An AI that takes
<br>
property rights as primary would prevent such things, I assume.
