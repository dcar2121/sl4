Jeff writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I care first and foremost about future people who have my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories and intentions....
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the perfectly familiar and normal disposition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; respects such as... avoiding torture if at all possible.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only issue I'm claiming is a language convention is the issue of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether you label your future self to be the teleported copy of you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the non-teleported copy of you, or some combination of both to be you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's clear what relationship they have to you... they are both copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your brain.  So I don't think calling either one &quot;you&quot; is going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell you anything more interesting.
</em><br>
<p>But why be so reserved about the language? Since the problems
<br>
with identity, memory erasure, teleportation, uploading are not
<br>
familiar to us, I think that there is a tendency for some people to
<br>
overreact and try to throw out altogether what is taken as
<br>
commonplace by all of us every day.
<br>
<p>You really ought to suppose that you are the same person that
<br>
you were yesterday, and the same person who wrote the words
<br>
above. But if you are so inclined to argue, then I guess that I
<br>
must simply be grateful that you don't wreck yourself by denying
<br>
that two temperatures, or two pressures, or a single particular
<br>
book at two different times, are the same. I am sure that no grave
<br>
look comes over your countenance when someone asks whether
<br>
you are the same Jeff Jones as &lt;blah blah&gt;, and you do not 
<br>
immediately dismiss their question as hopelessly wrongheaded
<br>
and necessarily to be answered in the negative.
<br>
<p>It's really not much harder with copies.  If you were copied and
<br>
the copy was asked, &quot;Are you the same Jeff Jones who I used
<br>
to know from the SL4 list?&quot;, the meaning and intent would be
<br>
perfectly clear, and you would---or should!---answer quite 
<br>
simply, &quot;Yes, I am&quot;.   So why try to be fussy about it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Strictly speaking, I think that a person should be defined by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their past, not their future.
</em><br>
<p>We know all the facts. A river is &quot;defined&quot; (if you must) by its
<br>
past and its future. The residents of Kansas City feel perfectly
<br>
comfortable with the Missouri river being the same river it was
<br>
yesterday and the same river it will be tomorrow, even though
<br>
they are not so pedantic to go about constantly reminding 
<br>
themselves of Heraclitus's statement to the contrary. We know
<br>
what Heraclitus meant, and we know what the citizens of Kansas
<br>
City mean. Is personal identity really so much different?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the truth is, every person is continuously splitting into multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons, who then experience multiple futures.  It just doesn't make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to label them all as the same person because they are different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.
</em><br>
<p>Whether it makes sense or not depends on the context. People will,
<br>
should, and ought to know what is meant. If A is duplicated into B
<br>
and C, and then A dies, each of B and C will pick up the continuation
<br>
of A's life, *as we know ad nauseam*., whatever silly legal or
<br>
domestic problems might arise. Each will certainly feel that he is
<br>
the same person as A, and I think that they should just get used
<br>
to the idea that B and C are the same person---at least for now,
<br>
though, as we all know, they do begin to diverge slightly over
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>To say that B is not A and C is not A amounts to claiming that
<br>
you aren't &quot;really&quot; the same person you were yesterday, which
<br>
really is fatuous nonsense. Likewise, it's obviously awkward
<br>
to insist that though B is the same person as A, and C is the
<br>
same person as A, they're not the same person. They know
<br>
all the facts (as do we), and they should just get used to it.
<br>
What is so hard, unfortunately, is that almost the first baby-thing
<br>
we learned in our cradles is that anything outside of what looks
<br>
to be our own unique piece of skin is necessarily non-self. It's
<br>
high time, with uploads and duplication coming, that we unlearn
<br>
that bit of wrongneadedness.
<br>
