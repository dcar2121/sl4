<em>&gt;I bet if you tried hard enough, you could think of a better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decision-theoretic solution to the above problem than &quot;fixing the set 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people you care about&quot; - which it's already too late for me to do, 
</em><br>
<p>There's some ambiguity in what I said.  In the phrase &quot;fixing the set
<br>
of people you care about&quot; I intended &quot;fix&quot; to mean &quot;keep permanently
<br>
constant&quot;, not &quot;repair&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        The Utility Function Is Not Up For Grabs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/newcombs-proble.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/newcombs-proble.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>If I'm correctly getting your point, you're saying that if you have
<br>
infinite resolution to your utility function, or an infinite planning
<br>
horizon, or an infinite number of potential people you're trying to
<br>
include in your altruism, or an infinite maximum utility, your values
<br>
have contradictions in them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;People sure are in a rush to hack the utility function all sorts of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ways... probably because they don't understand what this little mathy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;object *means*; it's the set of things you really, actually care about.
</em><br>
<p>I can't find a sensible interpretation of this.  
<br>
<p>I could try to take you literally here.  I'm human.  Therefore I don't
<br>
really maximize a utility function.  Therefore the above statement is
<br>
simply false.  Gee, that didn't last long.
<br>
<p>My most plausible figurative interpretation would literally be as
<br>
follows.  You don't need to read the whole thing, the important
<br>
difference is enclosed in _..._'s:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People sure are in a rush to hack the utility function all sorts of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways... probably because they don't understand what this little
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathy object *means*; it's the set of things _a_rational_actor_we_
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might_construct_someday_ really, actually cares about.
<br>
<p>It's entirely self-consistent for a rational actor to bound its
<br>
planning horizon, maximum utility, and the resolution of its utility
<br>
function.  A rational actor that is more-or-less altruistic might even
<br>
fix the set of people it's being altruistic for, and regard children
<br>
born after it is constructed as a blob of protoplasm that the parents
<br>
care about, rather than as a separate entity that deserves care on its
<br>
own.  
<br>
<p>(There are other ways to deal with newborns.)
<br>
<p>This is entirely consistent the rational actor &quot;winning&quot; according to
<br>
its own goals.
<br>
<p>So far as I can tell, it makes perfect sense to hack the utility
<br>
function that way, but you're saying it doesn't.  Why doesn't it?
<br>
<p>I suppose I could try coming up with some more fanciful figurative
<br>
interpretation of what you said, but I sense diminishing returns.  If
<br>
you want me to think you're saying something plausible, you'll have to
<br>
try harder.
