</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just because we've always done things like this

</em><br>

<p>How is it that wild tech advances leave people
<br>
working harder and for less pay? Because the
<br>
extra value is being siphoned off for the
<br>
employers. The logical end, as Bill Joy pointed
<br>
out, is that the boss gets what he wants from the
<br>
machines and the rest of humanity is expendable.
<br>
<p>For a different idea on what to do, Robert Anton
<br>
Wilson's 1979 novel _The Homing Pigeons_ (book 3
<br>
of _Schrodinger's Cat_) proposes something called
<br>
the R.I.C.H. economy: Rising Income through
<br>
Cybernetic Homeostasis. Basically, guaranteed
<br>
good pay for those replaced by a machine, and a
<br>
good bounty for inventing yourself out of a job.
<br>
He anticipated many, many things discussed here.
<br>
<p>Having said that, this is the sort of debate that
<br>
becomes utterly moot with FAI.
