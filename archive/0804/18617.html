<em>&gt;  The AI can replace the entire human race for that matter. But never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mind, and forget about gray goo, I believe unbounded happiness will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the biggest threat our decedents face and the only thing that might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  prevent our mind children from becoming Gods; it may even be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  explanation for the Fermi Paradox. If you could be the happiest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (uploaded of course) man alive just by editing the value of one integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in your source code you might be strongly tempted to do so, I know I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'll just change the mean happiness quotient in my code from a 5 to a 6,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  oh yes that's much better, I wonder what a 7 would feel like, wow that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  was even better than I expected, 8 is really not that much greater than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  7 so it couldn't hurt to….
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The trouble is if you're perfectly happy right now then you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  incentive to do anything because things are perfect already so any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  change you make will only make things worse. Best to just put your hands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in your pockets and do nothing except enjoy the ride. The Universe may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be full of intelligent civilizations but they're all lotus eaters and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hence invisible. I hope I'm wrong, although I can imagine more horrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fates.
</em><br>
<p>We have other urges in us beyond the pursuit of happiness; are you
<br>
really so confident that they will get sidelined? The happy people I
<br>
know are more likely to do a lot of interesting and otherwise
<br>
stimulating stuff, and it does seem that the happiness is a cause, not
<br>
a consequence of that.
<br>
<p>We could instruct our &quot;happy box&quot; to make us deliriously happy while
<br>
AT THE SAME TIME we do a lot of other, productive things... Especially
<br>
as we don't need to waste time worrying about happiness.
<br>
