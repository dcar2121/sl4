<p><em>&gt; But the rich/poor debate is not very relevant in the face of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity; the human/animal debate, on the other hand, is crucial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The arguments of the environmental movement boil down to &quot;leave nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone&quot;, with some possibly minor corrections. Since our knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural systems is poor, this is a sensible position.
</em><br>
<p>I basically agree, but I find that on the whole we're being way too
<br>
timid here. Nothing is certain. You can't stop change anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But after a singularity, we could do whatever we wanted with &quot;nature&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strip mine it, vary it, create all sorts of beings and plants, use it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for artistic expression, ensure that no animal suffers or dies, etc...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the moral standing of animals is something that will have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tackled.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely! The cruelty that nature regularly visits upon 
<br>
many creatures is completely unacceptable and intolerable.
<br>
We need  to step in and put a stop to it. Most of the vicious
<br>
killers, like wolves, need to be eradicated, except for a few in
<br>
some very spiffy zoos, where they eat what we mercifully
<br>
prepare for them. (Later, we may have some deer who
<br>
enjoy being torn to shreads by wolves, which would be
<br>
very fine also)
<br>
<p>But all this talk about keeping Earth &quot;green&quot; is making me
<br>
sick. Earth needs to become the color of silicon and
<br>
diamondoid, and even before than, animals and trees
<br>
should not be living that are taking up resources on
<br>
which more people could live.
<br>
<p>In the good old days, Asimov could describe Trantor, the
<br>
planet-wide city, and no one thought that that was just awful.
