<p>Then it looks like we agree entirely in terms of actual real-world
<br>
behavior.  We just disagree in terms of the explanation.  And perhaps
<br>
a little bit on the actual timeframe.  For instance, I would only be
<br>
willing to sacrifice myself entirely for copies that were within an
<br>
hour or so.  After that, I would slowly become more reluctant as we
<br>
began to have different experiences.  Keep in mind that if you wait a
<br>
month before you kill yourself, then you're permanently killing all of
<br>
the memories for that month... no backup, no extra copy.  I wouldn't
<br>
want to do that for my home desktop computer, let alone my
<br>
consciousness!
<br>
<p>Also, even if the time were only a minute... there are some situations
<br>
where I would be unwilling to do it.  Namely, if there was something
<br>
really important to me that happened in that minute.
