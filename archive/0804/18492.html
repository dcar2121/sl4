<p>I agree that twins are less identical than physical duplicates.  But
<br>
physical duplicates are only identical at the microsecond of copying,
<br>
and become more and more differentiated as time goes on.  Far into the
<br>
future, they are almost as different as the twins.  In fact, strictly
<br>
speaking the twins are physical duplicates as well, they were just
<br>
duplicated in the egg before being born.  Since a lot of our behavior
<br>
is determined by things that happen to us before birth, they have had
<br>
a lot of time to become different.  The copies made later on have had
<br>
less time, and they share a significant portion of their memories.
<br>
But other than that, I don't see how it is any different.
<br>
