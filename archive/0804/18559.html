<p>Yeah, my price is probably low.  Suppose I rephrase the question.  How much
<br>
would they have to pay you to take a pill on Friday night where you wake up
<br>
Sunday morning?  Assume you go about your normal activities on Saturday (not
<br>
drunk), but just have no memory of it afterwards.
<br>
<p>Or let's remove the disturbing aspect of the discontinuity of memory.  (Where
<br>
did I leave my keys?  Weren't you listening to me yesterday?)  Suppose you
<br>
knew the date of your death.  Assume normal life expectancy.  How much would
<br>
you pay to live one day longer, or accept to die one day sooner?
<br>
<p>Make it a 2 player game.  You name a figure, $X.  Your opponent has the option
<br>
of either accepting $X from you, in which case you die one day later and he
<br>
dies one day sooner, or he can pay you $X in which case you die one day sooner
<br>
and he lives one day longer.  What amount do you name?
<br>
<p>Suppose your opponent can also name a multiplier, m, so he can choose to pay
<br>
or accept $X*m for m days of your life (up to some limit, say half of
<br>
whoever's life expectancy is smaller).
