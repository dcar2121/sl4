<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  What keeps these discussions from boiling down to being &quot;incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  boring&quot;, as you write, is that *actions* will depend on our views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  The main point is to properly prescribe actions. The chief such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  action that you have to decide (or will have to decide when uploaded),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (and need to decide now if you want to be philosophically prepared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  for all eventualities) can be seen from this following example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          An exact molecular duplicate of you was created
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          ten minutes ago and lies in the next room frozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          in a cask of ice. On top the cask of ice is a briefcase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          containing $10M dollars. The choice facing you (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          version, instance, who is now breathing and conscious)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          is (A) to undergo disintegration, in which your ten-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          minute-ago duplicate is resurrected and the money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          becomes his (i.e. in my view, yours), or whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          frozen copy in the other room is disintegrated (along
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;          with the $10M).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Please tell me what you would do in this situation.  If you make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  sensible decision, then yes, we are only arguing terminology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assuming I could trust the people who were supposedly going to revive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the copy with the $10M, it's a no brainer... I would disintegrate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let the copy wake up and have $10M dollars.    I've explained why in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my earlier post on &quot;objective anticipation&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, sorry.  I hadn't remembered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hopefully, this is the decision you're calling &quot;sensible&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. (Sorry Heartland.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So do you agree now that arguing about personal identity is entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about language and mostly a waste of time?
</em><br>
<p>I doubt very much that we can state objectively what is and what
<br>
is not a waste of time to discussion. Billions of people would think
<br>
that every issue discussed on the forums you and I frequent would
<br>
be a waste of time.
<br>
<p>No, it's *not* entirely about language, even though it seems that on
<br>
this particular action item you and I agree. (There are dozens more
<br>
where we may not and probably would not agree.) Perhaps the
<br>
central difficult *real* issue---definitely not about language---is
<br>
the degree two which people change over time. We say, and we
<br>
should say, that I am the same person I was a year ago and will
<br>
be a year from now, whereas for some large enough intervals,
<br>
that ceases to be true, (for almost anyone).  That is, I would
<br>
consider Lee Corbin to have survived if you replace me by who/
<br>
what I was a year ago. But not if you replace me with the three
<br>
year old I once &quot;was&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, it's also important to bring the language into alignment
<br>
with the actions we would take. If we start saying things like &quot;I
<br>
am not the same person I was a millisecond or a microsecond
<br>
ago, then it leads to the erroneous idea that great harm would
<br>
be done to one by replacing him by the entity that he was a
<br>
microsecond ago. Eventually, after uploading (or we start to
<br>
consider entirely electronic entities), these questions become 
<br>
quite practical. 
<br>
<p>Once when I was very young, I asked about the duplication 
<br>
scenario that I had just thought of:  &quot;Which one would I be?&quot;
<br>
Very soon I saw that the answer was something like &quot;You will
<br>
be both and neither&quot;, because it became clear that (as Stathis
<br>
and others like to say) we all change continually all the time.
<br>
So I eventually settled on the answer &quot;you will be both&quot;. And
<br>
today, so many decades later, that answer still seems inescapable.
<br>
