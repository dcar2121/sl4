<em>&gt;  &gt;  Curiously, after reading all these posts, I'm moving more towards the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  &quot;ban destructive teleportation&quot; side :-) The reason is simple:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  murdering someone who knows they are about to be murdered and doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  want to be is very high on my list of ethically monsterous actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  Destructive teleportation, in principle, is equivalent to walking up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  from a chair. In practice, it is very close to the above murder - just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  one error away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But taking the bus is also one error away from murder, the murder of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the original *and* the copy, if you look at it that way.
</em><br>
<p>A good point! But I was looking at issue like a lawyer would, rather
<br>
than a scientist (an occasionally fruitful excercise which I recommend
<br>
to all). Why? Because arguing the rightness or wrongness of some
<br>
specific issue is one thing; but, in practice, we decide to allow or
<br>
forbid things using the legal system. And this is probably the best
<br>
system so far for deciding these things.
<br>
<p>Then how would the issue of destructive teleportation look like in a
<br>
legal system (assume the destruction part is not nessesary for the
<br>
teleportation)? Not so hot, I have to admit. It involves the
<br>
destruction of a human being. This destruction is not necessary, but
<br>
contingent. It is permited by two facts: the existence of a copy, and
<br>
the physical state of the current being (unconscious).
<br>
<p>Neither of these issues show much sign of being elevatable to a legal
<br>
principle. &quot;He was very similar to another person&quot; and &quot;but he was
<br>
asleep&quot; are not going to be good defences against murder charges.
<br>
<p>Then there is the whole issue of &quot;unconscious&quot;. Probably the
<br>
&quot;original&quot; will have to be preserved for a short while for quality
<br>
control, and to check the other has arrived. Will the original be
<br>
asleep, or frozen in time? Will some part of his brain be active? What
<br>
procedure will be used to distinguish an &quot;original&quot; that can be safely
<br>
eliminated from one that is a human being, worthy of every civil
<br>
right?
<br>
<p>Then there are some special considerations:
<br>
1) An run-away criminal escapes through the teleporter, and the police
<br>
demand his &quot;original&quot; be awoken and interogated.
<br>
2) Someone starts shooting people at the &quot;receiver station&quot;, and
<br>
shoots someone who has just come through. They call back to the
<br>
sending station, and ask them to awake the original copy...
<br>
3) Though a mistake, an &quot;original&quot; is awoken, and then goes public
<br>
with the story about how he was nearly killed. Campaigns are
<br>
organised.
<br>
4) Some scandal happens about originals that we not properly drugged, etc...
<br>
<p>The only way I see this being legal is if
<br>
a) law becomes utterly libertarian; by signing a contract, I agree
<br>
that I will get killed (in some sense) as part of the process.
<br>
b) a specific exception is carved out for destructive teleportation
<br>
(unlikely unless the economic advantages are large), or
<br>
c) someone comes up with a general ethical framework involving
<br>
duplication, that allows destructive teleportation to happen.
<br>
<p>In fact, c) is a bit what we are engaged in for the last week or so.
<br>
But the issue of destructive telportation will be a sideshow, I feel,
<br>
to the eventual ethical/legal consensus on duplication. And seeing as
<br>
that is the most controversial, I think that we should not focus on
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>To sum up my position: I agree that, in principle, that destructive
<br>
teleportation, perfectly implemented, is the same as walking out of
<br>
the room. But if the only fact I knew about the next century was
<br>
&quot;destructive teleportation is permitted&quot;, then I would be worried.
<br>
