<em>&gt;  Has anyone tried to formalize this?  It doesn't make sense when I look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  at it closely.  For example, my scheme [1] has an expiration date.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  takes action to optimize its utility function at a specific time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that's determined at the beginning, and when it's done, it's done.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  might then have set up some mechanism to be run again with a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  expiration date, or the humans might decide to start it again, or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or the humans might run something else.  Any of these possibilities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  if they happen, would be a natural consequence of the AI having put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the world into the state it thinks best at the expiration date, not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  continuation of the planning process it was doing before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  expiration date.
</em><br>
<p>So the AI will see no problem with doing something that destroys the
<br>
world a day after expiration, provided it's helpful now and humans
<br>
aren't aware of it (because the knowledge would make us suffer).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If there's no expiration date, I'm concerned about indefinitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  deferred gratification, where the AI is always putting off giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people what they want so it give them more of what they want later in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the case where it thinks it can invest the utility points better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the humans.
</em><br>
<p>This is a potential problem. I don't know how to solve it, but a sharp
<br>
cutoff is Not The Way. Even exponential discounting would be superior,
<br>
even though it has very implausible normative implications:
