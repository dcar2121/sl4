</em><br>
<p>No, I don't expect you to believe that because it's not the same to me.
<br>
<p>I care first and foremost about future people who have my memories and
<br>
intentions.  After that, I care about people who have similar DNA
<br>
and/or similar interests and life perspectives.  (Because I find it
<br>
easier to identify with such people.)  Finally, I care more about
<br>
humans than other species, except for perhaps posthumans because they
<br>
have such great value to future society.  So you see, I am not at all
<br>
egalitarian in my caring.  However, it is true that on some level I
<br>
care enough about every sentient being in order to grant certain basic
<br>
respects such as... avoiding torture if at all possible.
<br>
<p>The only issue I'm claiming is a language convention is the issue of
<br>
whether you label your future self to be the teleported copy of you,
<br>
the non-teleported copy of you, or some combination of both to be you.
<br>
&nbsp;It's clear what relationship they have to you... they are both copies
<br>
of your brain.  So I don't think calling either one &quot;you&quot; is going to
<br>
tell you anything more interesting.  Strictly speaking, I think that a
<br>
person should be defined by their past, not their future.  Since the
<br>
truth is, every person is continuously splitting into multiple
<br>
persons, who then experience multiple futures.  It just doesn't make
<br>
sense to label them all as the same person because they are different
<br>
people.
