</em><br>
If enough of the capable researchers are busy enough noodling what 
<br>
Friendliness is and how it may be absolutely guaranteed then it will 
<br>
take 50 years before we have AGI of sufficient power that anyone 
<br>
actually has a reason to care if it is &quot;friendly&quot; or not.   Sometimes I 
<br>
am almost paranoid enough to believe that &quot;Friendly AI&quot; was thought up 
<br>
to throw a monkey wrench into AGI R &amp; D.  Not that it was progressing 
<br>
with great alacrity in any case.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; My belief is that people who think this way

</em><br>
Generally attempting to persuade a lot of people of something in order 
<br>
to have your needs met or your ideal obtained is a fool's errand.   The 
<br>
most likely result of a really good and successful campaign in this 
<br>
direction is to scare people enough they do a march on Frankenstein's 
<br>
Monster and shut down all progress towards AGI and much advanced 
<br>
computing for good measure.    No worries though because this is such a 
<br>
insular little side issue.   Personally I am more concerned that we go 
<br>
too long without the intelligence increase that only AGI or significant 
<br>
IA can bring.   Our world is much too complicated for merely human minds 
<br>
to keep it more or less on the rails.   I see the biggest danger as just 
<br>
not being smart enough on this rock to continue to successfully deal 
<br>
with current and up-coming situations.    
<br>
<p>Some of us are neither unable or unwilling to confront the problem.  We 
<br>
simply think we have much more immediate problems requiring a great deal 
<br>
more intelligence successfully created and brought to bear asap.
