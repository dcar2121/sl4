I had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't think that the domain of the [your] function is [should be] S,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; however. The domain of the function G is the GLUT itself; G takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entries of the GLUT to other entries. 
</em><br>
<p>and Stuart writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Still some confusions (I see G as a function on S - it takes one state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the system, and gives you another (subsequent) state, so is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function)! But the main ideas are there.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps we resolve this by noting that the first GLUT (involving no
<br>
hashing) has entries that *are* polynomials, or which *are* states
<br>
of a computer or brain, or which *are* generations of the Life Board?
<br>
Maybe we are saying the same thing? It's probably a minor point,
<br>
but I like math, and precision feels good  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me paraphrase the argument I've been circling around:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A GLUT may be hash equivalent to consciousness; but if there exists a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set-up that is not too complicated, where the rules of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not too complicated (compared with a full GLUT), then we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take this set up as really &quot;telling us something about consciousness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than the GLUT, which tells us little.
</em><br>
<p>I take you to mean the following. We really have a large variety
<br>
of GLUTs and it would be well to distinguish them. They are,
<br>
respectively, the ones which contain addresses (of course), 
<br>
and addresses such that the contents at a particular address is 
<br>
<p>case 1: a polynomial (or simple text encoding of one)
<br>
case 2: a generation of Conway's Life
<br>
case 3: a state of a Turing machine, or other regular computer
<br>
case 4: a living thinking human brain state
<br>
<p>Don't you think we need to subscript the term &quot;GLUT&quot;, e.g.,
<br>
GLUTp, GLUTcl, GLUTtm, GLUTh (h for human), GLUTa
<br>
(a for alien).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this way, modern methods are telling us more about these objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than classical methods, just as some compact theory of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tells us more than a GLUT.
</em><br>
<p>It certainly has that potential, and my intuition says we can get there,
<br>
if we have not already.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is especially true if you consider &quot;partial truths&quot;: a partial truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a GLUT is just some sort of sub-GLUT, a partial truth of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of consciousness can be considerably simpler (even relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the theory of consciousness).
</em><br>
<p>Very interesting. Sort of parallel to partial function. Might examples be
<br>
<p>(A) suppose that the huge GLUTh or GLUTa passes not only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Turing Test, but convinced several people, each given
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three hours, that it is conscious as well as intelligent. 
<br>
(B) a subset of (A) consisting of the first hour for each interrogator
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(with the GLUT becoming suddenly silent afterwards)
<br>
(C) a subset of (A) but with gaps, so that (I believe) the GLUT
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just ignores many questions, though somehow seems aware
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in many cases that it had failed to answer, or aware that 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in its opinion the interrogator had been off-line
<br>
<p>If these don't work, then I'm not following your last paragraph.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you want me to go over the polynomial example again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with your comments? I will, if you think that knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the specifics will be useful!
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the offer. I'm tempted, but I'll take a rain-check if
<br>
that's all right. Your patience is exemplary!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; PS: What is this &quot;end of time&quot; you were mentioning? :-)
</em><br>
<p>Julian Barbour wrote, as you probably know, a book with that
<br>
title, and there are other theories which attempt to reduce time
<br>
to something else (e.g. configuration space or mathematical
<br>
structures in Platonia). I still want to avoid having to believe 
<br>
in those, for several reasons, most notably because it *could*
<br>
(in my eyes, at least) reduce moral decisions to gibberish.
