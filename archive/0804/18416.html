</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  book at two different times, are the same.
</em><br>
<p>If by &quot;book&quot; you mean the information contained in a book, then it's a
<br>
meaningless question whether two books are the same (for example, two
<br>
copies of the same book stored online) since information can only
<br>
exist or not exist... it can't exist in multiplicity.  Same goes for
<br>
temperatures and pressures which are simply numbers... there is no
<br>
such thing as the &quot;number of 58 degreeses&quot; that exist in the world.
<br>
If on the other hand, by book, you mean the matter making up the book,
<br>
that's analogous to asking about my body, not about me.  Actually,
<br>
neither of them are exactly analogous, but I wouldn't agree that any
<br>
of them are meaningful distinctions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  We know all the facts. A river is &quot;defined&quot; (if you must) by its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  past and its future.
</em><br>
<p>But people are not rivers, they are more like trees.  In fact, when a
<br>
river *does* split into two rivers, we almost always call the separate
<br>
branches different rivers.  In a multiverse where every person is
<br>
constantly splitting into a zillion other people, the analogy of a
<br>
single river for someone's timeline is simply not accurate.  All of
<br>
the leaves of the tree are different.  Some of them *very* different.
<br>
It makes little more sense to call different branches of a person the
<br>
same person than it does to call identical twins the same person.  It
<br>
makes even less sense to call two copies made in the same universe the
<br>
same person... since that would make it very awkward for them to
<br>
interact and soon become an impossible charade to maintain.
<br>
<p>Even though I have strong opinions on what the best way is to talk
<br>
about this, I must admit that I find the whole subject of personal
<br>
identity *incredibly* boring, as it has nothing to do with the real
<br>
world and is--as I've mentioned--simply a language convention.  I had
<br>
hoped such discussions would die down after the previous thread was
<br>
sniped and moved to another list (presumably for people who have
<br>
deluded themselves into thinking it's an interesting question).  The
<br>
bottom line is, you've chosen a poor convention, and I've chosen a
<br>
much better one.  There's really not much more I can say about it.
<br>
