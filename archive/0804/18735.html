<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;  What decision?  We are building something many orders of magnitude more

<em>&gt; &gt; face.   It is a bit odd to being worrying about what primates or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; biological creatures it will benefit as if we are likely to have much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable control over that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The emphasis is on &quot;WE are building...&quot; If we assume that we will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some degree of control over the final ethical system of the AI (if we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; control as to whether other animals are included. Since we probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't be able to try more than once, knowing what we need to try is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vital.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why would we believe we have the ability to determine the &quot;final ethical
<br>
system&quot; of entities many orders of magnitude smarter than us not to mention
<br>
able to self-improve indefinitely?   We have some leverage in the initial
<br>
goal system.   That is about it.   But that in no way says that we can go
<br>
about saying that this or that group of beings will benefit in order to
<br>
appease the masses or interest them in this work.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; It is certainly a con job to sell it to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; public and claim tax expropriations to build it on such a basis of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the benefit of the &quot;taxpayers&quot; or some other popular target requiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spending gobs of other people's money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't quite see the argument here (unless you're arguing that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chances of an AI eliminating us are high). If the AI will refrain from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminating/enslaving/lobotomising us and if it provides great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefits to all, then it seems that this has the strongest case for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coercive taxation (as the expected benefits far outweigh such things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as social security or a functioning police force).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There is no way  to make an airtight (to say the least) case that the AI
<br>
will  provide a relative utopia.  There is also very shakey morality behind
<br>
the idea that the few who can or think they can more or less understand,
<br>
predict and control the AI sufficiently to make such guarantees have the
<br>
right to effectively partially enslave the rest of the population to fund
<br>
their efforts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not make the beneficiaries all sentient/conscious beings?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  What the heck does that even mean?  Benefits according to whom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Survival, and lack of excessive pain, would be reasonable benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even for dumb animals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is &quot;excessive pain&quot;?  In a world of perfect backups and multiple &quot;real&quot;
<br>
and virtual &quot;lives&quot; exactly what is &quot;excessive pain&quot; vs. another learing
<br>
experience of consequences reasoably to be expected from a given set of
<br>
choices in a give environment?   Are you saying that all less than pleasant
<br>
feedback should be eliminated regardless in all environments?

<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; best guesstimate of the best benefits each would desire if each of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beings was much smarter and more sane and more generally enlightened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is or perhaps even dreams or can dream of being?   ARGH.    Hopefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AGI will not be nearly so sloppy in its thinking.    Hopefully we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wait to build AGI until we get sufficient political agreement that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; workable plan for uplifting the sea slug.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope we don't put off building an AGI until we know how to uplift
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sea slug. I do hope, however, that we design an AGI that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; display some ethical behaviour towards at least some animals.
