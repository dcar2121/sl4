<em>&gt;  Humans have traditionally &quot;enslaved&quot; lower animals, and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  progress depended on it for thousands of years.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed. But our progress is no longer dependent on it anymore (just as
<br>
progress in some very primitive cultures was arguably dependent on
<br>
slavery, but not any more).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The two big large contributors to progress have been (i) Rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of Law (ii) Respect for Private Property.  These clearly apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  only to humans. Cows, for example, cannot understand either,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and they have no private property.
</em><br>
<p>This not an argument for depriving them of all rights - some humans
<br>
cannot understand those concept either, and are not treated as chattel
<br>
as a consequence. Though their rights are restricted, they are not put
<br>
to death... And respect for private property is not as popular
<br>
nowadays as it was in its heyday (not to dispute its usefulness, of
<br>
course; but the Lockean maximalist position hasn't been tested in
<br>
modern society, so we can't really say much about it in practice).
<br>
<p>Probably similarly to my focus on avoiding negatives rather than
<br>
enhancing positives, I tend to have the philosophy that when there is
<br>
some ethical dilemma, one should ere on the side of giving out more
<br>
rights, IF the cost of doing so is minute. After a singularity, there
<br>
will so much extra resources available, that there will be no need to
<br>
raise and kill cows, hence I'd say the case for granting them
<br>
protection as semi-sentient beings is very strong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This thread started when the need for a line to be drawn was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  realized. I've drawn that line in my previous post, and here I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  defend it. Questions?
</em><br>
<p>I'd draw the line where I've always drawn it: that plausible-sounding
<br>
rights should always be granted if their costs are tiny. If the divine
<br>
AI is able to guarantee the continued survival of every living being
<br>
with some sort of nervous system, and if this continued survival comes
<br>
at a trifling cost, I'd extend some protection to slugs!
<br>
