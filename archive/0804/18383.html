</em><br>
<p>But my tribal elders base all their decisions on the ethics of a culture that
<br>
maximizes the reproductive fitness of my tribe.  In the ancient past when
<br>
teleportation technology did not exist, there was simply no rule.  The closest
<br>
approximation to duplication would be having a child.  My elders do have
<br>
advice about children.  You should have as many as possible.  Once you are too
<br>
old to reproduce and your children no longer need care, it is your duty to die
<br>
and stop using resources.  It does not matter if your death is painful or not.
<br>
<p>With copy machines, evolution selects a different rule.  As long as I can copy
<br>
myself, I am reproductively viable and valuable.  It is my duty to make as
<br>
many copies of myself as possible as fast as possible.  Copies don't need to
<br>
be reared, so if I am unable to copy myself, it is my duty to die immediately.
<br>
Only those people who can copy themselves as fast as the fastest copiers are
<br>
conscious and deserve to live.
