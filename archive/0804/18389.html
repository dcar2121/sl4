<em>&gt; &gt;  Example: teleportation.  It works like this.  I step into a booth at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  and a copy of me is produced at point B.  The copy at point A is slowly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  painfully killed by being crushed between the soundproofed walls of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  teleportation booth in a process that takes 24 hours.  For $2 extra I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  option of having the copy at point A injected with an overdose of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narcotic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  making the death fast and painless.  But I have teleported hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  both ways and can't tell the difference.  I always come out at point B
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  would rather save the money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The process of walking from A to B results in the copy at A painlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanishing from the universe and another copy appearing at B. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what ordinary survival from moment to moment is all about. So if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of transport such as destructive teleportation reproduces this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process, I wouldn't worry about it. But if some new form of walking is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovered which leaves a copy at A to be slowly crushed, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to your non-destructive teleportation scenario, that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be worrying indeed. This is because with two copies extant at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, I have a subjectively 1/2 chance of becoming either of the two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a sense I don't really &quot;become&quot; my copy even if there's only one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, but I feel as if I do because that's the way my brain has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved to think.
</em><br>
<p>No, this is the same problem as the quantum coin.  Subjective expectation for
<br>
rational agents requires multiple trials and counting outcomes.  If you are
<br>
copied 100 times when a coin comes up heads, then there is a subjective 99%
<br>
chance of heads because after multiple trials that is what you are most likely
<br>
to remember.  In the case of teleportation I end up at point B every time,
<br>
independent of the method used to kill the copy at A.  If you believe you
<br>
might be tortured, then that belief is based on faith rather than experience. 
<br>
Faith says that you are going to step into a booth and be crushed with 100%
<br>
probability, so you will probably pay the $2.  But after repeating enough
<br>
times and always ending up at B, you will at some point decide to save the
<br>
money.
<br>
<p>If you prefer, think of teleportation as equivalent to being tortured and then
<br>
having the memory of the torture erased.  This has zero utility to a rational
<br>
agent because there is no change in mental state.
