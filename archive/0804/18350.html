</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; given that you have always enjoyed (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; thought you enjoyed!) your visual experiences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; you might seriously consider an expensive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; slightly risky operation to restore your sight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I think that that is exactly true, though clearly some part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of me is *enjoying* something closely related. But yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  it cannot be said that I am enjoying the visual experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  since according to me it is being looked up.
</em><br>
<p>I appreciated very much your discussion of blindsight, BTW.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; I claim that the argument whereby if part of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; brain is replaced by the simulation you could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; possibly notice anything had changed *proves*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; that the simulation must be conscious in exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; same way as biological tissue.
</em><br>
<p>That argument may also be a bit circular: &quot;you could
<br>
not possibly notice&quot; may beg the question of what 
<br>
&quot;you&quot; is. Naturally I would contend that &quot;you&quot; are
<br>
diminished by whatever parts of your experience 
<br>
are looked up.
<br>
<p>That is not to say you're wrong, but it does seem
<br>
to me to be just another way of saying that 
<br>
looked-up experience is as valid as &quot;authentically
<br>
computed&quot; experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; If [Lee is right] then there is no *proof* that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; an upload will be conscious in the same way as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; the original. You might think that it sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; reasonable, but ultimately you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; to take it on faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  It would be a very strong sort of faith, though, again for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the same reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My problem is that without the fading qualia / partial zombification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument as I have outlined I have no really persuasive reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that I would remain conscious in the same way as I am now if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my brain is replaced with a simulation running on a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate. I welcome any other arguments you have might have to offer.
</em><br>
<p>I probably have nothing new to add, but if you were
<br>
planning an action based upon a weighted sum of you-
<br>
being-right and me-being-right, then I would say, in
<br>
the case that I'm right, that there are, I believe, a number
<br>
of smooth transition scenarios that start with your present
<br>
brain, and replace it bit by bit with electro-mechanical
<br>
and computerized hardware that would have (of course)
<br>
exactly the same functional behavior, and that these make
<br>
altogether a good argument for such a simulation/emulation
<br>
being satisfactory. 
<br>
<p>But yes, since I've put out an argument against complete
<br>
functionalism, you'll probably find &quot;the same functional
<br>
behavior&quot; as less than convincing coming from me. But if
<br>
indeed I am right, then all that is really needed is the
<br>
ordinary causal connection between &quot;adjacent states&quot;,
<br>
which is preserved in uploaded and similar simulation
<br>
(emulated) scenarios.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; You also have to admit that you might be at least partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; a zombie right now, since feeling that you're all conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; does not count as evidence that this is in fact the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Well, I don't think that that's something that I (or anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that was pretending to be me) could or would ever concede.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  For in the case at hand, where I am an evolutionarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  derived organism, we agree along with right thinking people everywhere  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that I'm conscious. On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  other hand, if I were just a GLUT with a tiny, simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  loader program, then since it would simulate (but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  emulate) me, then it too would erroneously announce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that it was conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but I know right now that I'm not a zombie, regardless of whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else believes me. What you're suggesting is that this special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal knowledge might be unreliable: I may yet be a zombie, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partial zombie, despite feeling what I feel.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't agree.  Instead, I agree with you, namely, that
<br>
from your point of view---assuming that you are not being
<br>
looked up, i.e., not a zombie (and so *there is* a &quot;your
<br>
point of view)---you do have absolute knowledge (or as
<br>
near as we ever come to such a thing) that you are
<br>
conscious.
<br>
<p>So by definition, if you are indeed feeling anything at all,
<br>
then you are conscious. 
<br>
<p>Now it would be mighty weird to take a looked-up person,
<br>
and demonstrate to it that it was being looked up! Needless
<br>
to say, this simulation (not, in my eyes, an emulation) would
<br>
react as though extremely surprised and extremely skeptical,
<br>
exactly, of course, as you would if shown a false proof or
<br>
given a false demonstration that you were being looked up
<br>
(when in fact you were not so being).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But surely *at bottom* consciousness must be this feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have.
</em><br>
<p>One of its necessary characteristics, I guess we agree, is
<br>
that it does provide such a feeling. Of course, from the
<br>
outside such a characterization is completely useless. The
<br>
only thing that can be reliably talked about are the objective
<br>
facts concerning how you're being emulated (to you), or
<br>
emulated or simulated (to the rest of us).
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People with blindsight behave as if they see things but lack visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences. The opposite phenomenon is Anton's syndrome: some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people with lesions in their visual cortex believe they can see normally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while in fact they are blind. Combine the two conditions (although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have never heard of an actual case) and you could have someone who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blind, but behaves as if he can see normally and believes he can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normally. This may seem a good candidate for zombie vision, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't so simple. Patients with Anton's syndrome are delusional, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insist they can see even though they are continually walking into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things. This is an extra neuropsychiatric disability, not a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence of losing perception. If the rest of your brain is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functioning normally, losing visual pathways is not something that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go unnoticed.
