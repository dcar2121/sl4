</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is &quot;natural&quot;? Why do you think your idea of &quot;naturalness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corresponds to the laws of metaphysics?
</em><br>
<p>It was, I admit, a poor choice of words; I put it in quotes
<br>
to try to diminish the extent to which I appeared to be 
<br>
depending on it.
<br>
<p>But is my main point clear?  That is, I contend that some structures
<br>
exhibit actual isomorphism to other structures. (Such an assumption
<br>
is actually by definition in mathematics.) For one example, two &quot;G2&quot;
<br>
type stars really do have objectively more similarity to each other
<br>
than they do to a typical Volkswagen.  Likewise, two Volkswagens
<br>
(of the same year and same make, especially) have intrinsically and
<br>
objectively more similarity of structure than either does with any
<br>
redwood. (It's possible that this claim separates the realists from
<br>
the nominalists, or from those of other philosophic schools, I really
<br>
don't know.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, it would be possible, as Putnam has done (or so I understand)
<br>
to nonetheless *force* an isomorphism between a small rock and 
<br>
any other possible computation. If we were to take a specific example,
<br>
then any given pebble in your garden can---under an isomorphism he
<br>
has detailed how to arrive at---be seen as performing the same
<br>
computation that an computer which has uploaded you is performing.
<br>
(Needless to say, this calls not only into question the very utility of
<br>
uploading, but even the utility of you preventing your body from
<br>
a deadly encounter with a truck tomorrow morning.)
<br>
<p>In short, I think that you were correct to call into question any
<br>
(even intuitive) notion of &quot;naturalness&quot;. I only wonder if the main
<br>
point which I was trying to make is nonetheless agreeable to 
<br>
readers.
