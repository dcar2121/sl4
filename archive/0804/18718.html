<p><em>&gt; This is a bizarrely collectivist-type argument (your value to society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifies your existence) from an apparent libertarian. What about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value, to that person, of their continued existence? Surely, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can't produce any value for others, and even if they have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money or other resources with which to express their preference, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference should count *ethically*, should be as much a part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global utility function as anyone else's. Many of us have this crazy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea that people have intrinsic worth independent of their economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances or value or utility to others.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't see any evidence of collectivism, here. I mean, I guess you could
<br>
call me a collectivist because I believe that people should contribute as
<br>
much as they can to the well-being of society, even though I believe that
<br>
the way to do this is through deregulated, low- to no-tax economies with
<br>
stable property rights. But that would be nuts. It's not collectivist to
<br>
argue that  people stick around until nobody cares that they die, and it's
<br>
not revolutionary to note that in many cases, the person dying thinks he
<br>
should stick around, even if everyone else disagrees.
<br>
<p>You also seem to be missing that this is a description of how the world
<br>
works *now*: some people grow enough food to live on, some people earn
<br>
enough money to buy food, some people get food from their dependents, some
<br>
people who don't have any dependents get food from governments (because
<br>
not-letting-people-starve is a popular political platform) and charities,
<br>
and some people steal. And people who cannot grow, buy, beg for, or steal
<br>
enough food to live will expire. If we had a system that recognized this,
<br>
and that structured itself so we'd have the appropriate incentives (e.g. if
<br>
your family wants you to stay alive even though you're starving, you can
<br>
steal a meal and they will pay the associated fines), it would all work out
<br>
better. As it is now, I can tell the present understanding of the system is
<br>
messed up because when I give a fairly neutral assessment, people call me an
<br>
alien commie monster.
