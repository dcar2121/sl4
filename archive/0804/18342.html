<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Suppose you have a 3 way Turing test between a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; human, a GLUT, and a human whose memory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; set to read-only at the start of the test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess I didn't understand that part. I thought that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you meant that for the duration of a test, e.g. between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times t1 and t2, no *new* memories may be acquired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That sure *sounds* like what you meant!  No?
</em><br>
<p>That is what I mean.  After the test, the person would have no memory of
<br>
taking part in it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (of equivalently, whose mental state is reset after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; each question).  Is the read-only human conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I responded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course the read-only human is conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Suppose it's only Homer, and he's only reciting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; the Iliad around a campfire. We adjust his nervous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; system so that *during the narration*, on which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; he is totally focused, neither the campfire, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; any of the sounds, nor any other of his senses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; are leaving any record whatsoever in his memory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (Naturally we have to idealize this a bit in order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to address, in principle, the answer to your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; idealized &quot;read-only human&quot; question.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is not the same.  He will still remember remembering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your brief reply fails to specify where my example goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong. *During the test*, while Homer is reading, he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course recalling his past life (he has to, for among other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons, to be able to recite the Iliad). But he is forming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no *new* memories, nor is he going to be able later to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember remembering, where the latter &quot;remembering&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifies a process occuring between t1 and t2. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remembering did indeed happen, but later he won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember that it did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, during the narration he doesn't happen to recall that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a moment earlier he had said such and such---by my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stipulation, he is able nonetheless to recite the whole thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same way that you, while reciting the alphabet, do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember (unless you try) reciting the letter 'C' when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have got to 'Q'.
</em><br>
<p>Normal memory is never read-only.  I will still remember reciting the
<br>
alphabet.  I will know that I said 'C' because if I had skipped it I would
<br>
have remembered doing so.  Each time I recall a sequence like the alphabet or
<br>
a phone number, I remember that I recalled it and it also reinforces that
<br>
memory.  What we call &quot;conscious experience&quot; is a recallable, continuous time
<br>
sequence of perceived events, both perceptions and thoughts.
<br>
<p>Consider the case of Homer without a hippocampus who is able to recall the
<br>
Iliad word for word (which he learned before his surgery) but has no short
<br>
term memory.  He will not remember anything that happened after his surgery
<br>
and will not form any new memories.  After reciting the Iliad he will not
<br>
remember that he had just done so.  Is he conscious?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It may be easy for some to say that there is no such thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; but someday we'll have much more thorough characterizations of it than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; we do now, and the argument that they're wrong will be all the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you define consciousness as a sequence S of algorithmically similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (K(S_n+1|S_n) = O(1)) then certainly it exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, I don't define consciousness as a sequence of states,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar or not. You could aim your question at Stathis, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example. Moreover, I don't follow your mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notation at all.  Is the O supposed to be Landau's &quot;big-oh&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notation?  (I gather that K is Kolmogorov complexity, though.)
</em><br>
<p>That is what I meant.  But choose your own definition if you prefer.  If we
<br>
could agree on a definition then the rest would be easy.
