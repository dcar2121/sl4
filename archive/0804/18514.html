</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mugger-to-be to stop it from taking his gun as he's travelling toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a forseeable mugging).  More pesky parameters to arbitrarily decide.  :-(.
</em><br>
<p>Different respect vs. compassion weighting is not the only reason
<br>
humans judge the car-buying contest as acceptable but the mugging bad;
<br>
we disapprove of using the threat of force to take others' property.
<br>
This should be taken into account.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But nevermind that, I'm too conflict-averse to make the attempt.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Buddhists say cows (and other mammals) are conscious.  If humans eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  cows, and my AI is influenced more by empathy for sentient beings than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by respect for cow butcherers, it will try to stop the cows from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  eaten.  But the problem is that the humans have guns and will start
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  shooting at the AI (or its implementor) if it stops them from kiling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and eating cows.  In contrast, the cows do not have guns.  So trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to save the cows would make the AI (and its implementor) targets for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  no political benefit.
</em><br>
<p>After a Singularity, this will not be even close to a problem. Before
<br>
the Singularity, minor issues like cows are unlikely to have
<br>
noticeable political effect relative to the idea of FAI itself. In any
<br>
case, you really shouldn't specify this level of detail in advance.
