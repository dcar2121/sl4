2008/4/30 Byrne Hobart &lt;<a href="mailto:bhobart@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Happy%20Box">bhobart@gmail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect that there will be a danger of 'zombifying' oneself with actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this: if you automatically rewrite your preferences to maximize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure and productivity, you have to wonder if this will mean obliterating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your ability to perceive such things so you don't have some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhappiness-generating philosophical crisis over your new set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences. The ability to engage in speculation over whether or not one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should participate in the rat-race can lead to arbitrary levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhappiness, and since you can rewrite your utility curve you will have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up either a) depressed despite feeling pleasure at doing good, or b)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unable to introspect enough to reconsider your initial decision.
</em><br>
<p>You might agonise over what preferences exactly you should choose, but
<br>
at the point where you notice this is becoming unpleasant and
<br>
unproductive you could alter your mind so that you are more decisive
<br>
and content with whatever choice you make. It is possible that the
<br>
decision the new you is happy with would have made the old you
<br>
unhappy, but so what? If you have regrets you can always make another
<br>
change, and if you are content you won't be worrying about it. In
<br>
ordinary life we don't worry about being happy just because we can see
<br>
that a former version of ourselves would have been unhappy under
<br>
similar circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One possible safety mechanism would be to simulate your responses under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various utility-schemes, observed by various utility-schemes. So, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, the drug addict can observe how he'd behave without the addiction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how he'd behave if he thought being a hard-working family-raising tax-paying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law-abider was euphoric, etc., but could also observe his current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drug-addicted perspective from the meta-perspective of a non-addict, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eudaimonic view, etc. This introduces a problem of indefinite abstraction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though: what does the drug-addict personality think of the responses of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-addict personality to the eudaimonic package of perceptions. Besides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just declaring artificial boundaries, I am not sure how to resolve this.
</em><br>
<p>The drug addict will do exactly as he wants to do. That might mean
<br>
removing his drug addiction or it might mean removing any residual
<br>
anxiety-producing attachment he has to societal norms. Unless he has a
<br>
predilection for modelling his behaviour in the way you describe I
<br>
don't see why he would or should do so.
