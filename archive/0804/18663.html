<em>&gt;&gt; Very good!  Few people understand the philosophical significance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the Busy Beaver.  Add just *one* neuron and the capacity of a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is potentially increased by an enormous factor. We cannot begin to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; imagine just how much pleasure a cubic meter of material could be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or how smart it could be.  Much less a Jupiter brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So I do not take &quot;unbounded&quot; literally.  It really cannot be taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; literally. The reason for this is that the speed of light is constant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If a brain gets too big, it ceases to be a single entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (One correction.  The Hubble radius is not constant, so you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to stop).
</em><br>
<p>By bringing in the speed of light, I was not referring to the
<br>
size of our Hubble volume. It's only 45 or so billion ly in
<br>
diameter, which, if Tegmark is right, is of course nothing
<br>
in an infinite universe. (And I've been looking for a long
<br>
time:  no one has proved that the universe is not infinite.)
<br>
<p>The speed of light limits how big an &quot;individual&quot; can be.
<br>
If it conducts thoughts at the speed of light, then is the
<br>
.1 second or so delay across the world still okay for
<br>
a single mind?  How can I think when half my brain
<br>
needs a few seconds to get up to speed with what the
<br>
other half has already &quot;thought&quot;?  So, to have solar-system
<br>
sized intelligences is out of the question.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I proposed a bound on happiness (or unhappiness)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of K(S2|S1), where S1 is the state of an intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the reinforcement signal, S2 is the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards, and K is Kolmogorov complexity. 
</em><br>
<p>An SR (stimulus response) theory of happiness?
<br>
That's a new one. Drugs can make one quite, 
<br>
quite happy (on any reasonable person's usage
<br>
of the term), at least for a while. There's no SR
<br>
that I can see. It's just neurons firing, again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is intuitive in that a stronger reinforcement signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; induces a greater change in mental state (as measured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the length of the shortest program that describes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the change), and that it is not possible to experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happiness without memory.
</em><br>
<p>That's just a new one on me, is all I'll say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By this definition, happiness would be bounded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the complexity of the intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>Now you've hit a nerve!  :-)   Hmm. I'd always supposed
<br>
that people could suffer more than animals because they
<br>
more thoroughly understand their situation. But maybe I
<br>
was wrong then. Let's see if Mr. Darwin can help.
<br>
<p>It makes sense that trees don't suffer when you chop
<br>
them down, *because they can't do anything about it*.
<br>
A mammal, on the other hand, has all sorts of reasons
<br>
to suffer.  For one, it's nature's way of telling him that
<br>
he must extricate himself from this situation, no matter
<br>
what. For another, nature is telling him &quot;never, never,
<br>
never forget how you got into this, stupid&quot;.
<br>
<p>So I proceed to refute my own long held position
<br>
thusly:  let's suppose that to get out of some horribly
<br>
painful situation, the subject must solve a puzzle.
<br>
Isn't it rather likely---at least from the depictions
<br>
I've seen on TV---that people can hurt so much
<br>
that they can't think clearly?  In some hideous
<br>
experiment (well, the Nazis were helpful in one
<br>
small, unfortunate way), the mean time of unlocking
<br>
a puzzle chain could be measured as a function of
<br>
pain. Indeed, there might be a minimum:  up to a
<br>
certain threshold, the victim/subject doesn't really
<br>
bother with solving the puzzle, or puts it off. At
<br>
a certain higher threshold he hurries as fast as he
<br>
can. Then isn't there also a point where his performance
<br>
tanks as the pain becomes blinding?  I think so.
<br>
<p>Therefore, a Darwinian analysis suggests that elephants
<br>
might suffer pain as much or more than do humans.
<br>
Hmm, can this be right? Of course if your KC analysis
<br>
is right, we still win the sensitivity contest.
