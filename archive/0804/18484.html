Jeff writes to John Clark and me
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [John wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  word &quot;identical&quot; in the term &quot;identical twins&quot; is misnamed. They should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  be called &quot;similar twins&quot;. Their personalities were not identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  either, certainly both could provide a long list of faults that their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  twin has, faults that of course they themselves lacked. They are two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  distinct individuals no argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know why you and Lee both thought that I was saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical twins were not distinct individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Because they're *so much* less identical than physical duplicates,
<br>
we thought it a weak attack.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My whole point is that you should not treat two distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals like they're the same person.  Lee is trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treat his copies as if they are the same person,
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I am.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; when they are different distinct individuals.
</em><br>
<p>John and I might retort that if duplicates were &quot;distinct individuals&quot;
<br>
then teleporting with a micro-second delay might seem hazardous
<br>
(perhaps not to you, but to some).
<br>
<p>As you know, I go even further and if one of my copies had to
<br>
die, they wouldn't particularly care which, so long as some ample
<br>
reward to the remaining ones was provided.
<br>
<p>I still would appreciate John Clark answering this question:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ten million dollars, would you agree to be instantly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and painlessly (except for possible &quot;psychological&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(irrational) &quot;pain&quot;) disintegrated, so that an exact 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duplicate of you made ten seconds ago can be reanimated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and learn that the money has been deposited to the John K.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark bank account?
<br>
<p>Lee
