</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government is better at some things and private enterprise is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at others?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Not really.  There is no evidence to support this assertion, just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertion itself.
</em><br>
<p>I would have thought that the fact some things are consistently paid
<br>
for by governments and others not does constitute evidence. Even an
<br>
ideologically pro-business, anti-tax country like Singapore has an
<br>
extensive public health and education system. How do you explain this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The United States did not have universal public education until well into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 20th century, yet for most of its history it had the highest literacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate in the world by a remarkable margin.  Its robust private education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system was destroyed for purely political reasons, and the consequence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we pay orders of magnitude more per student today for an arguably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inferior education.  At least the US still has its universities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  As for healthcare, I would make the observation while the last major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrialized country with a quasi-private system standing is the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States, the United States also enjoys significantly better diagnostic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accuracy and disease survival rates than any other industrialized country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As was highlighted in a recent Lancet Oncology Journal study, the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancer survival rate in the United States is 20-40% higher (depending on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type of cancer) than in Europe and the best in the world by any absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure.  Those are results that matter, since we are paying for healthcare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results and not feel-good platitudes.
</em><br>
<p>This study is often raised as evidence that the US is getting some
<br>
value for its at least 50% more expensive than anywhere else health
<br>
system. But against this is the fact that life expectancy in the US is
<br>
near the bottom for the developed world. Lower overall life
<br>
expectancy, more expensive overall health care, better cancer survival
<br>
rates... does that mean all the health professionals other than the
<br>
oncologists are ripping off everyone big time?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Add to that the fact that the vast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority of medical research happens in the US disproportionate to either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its population or GDP and everyone benefits from its marginally private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status.
</em><br>
<p>And this despite the poor general standards of basic education?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  An interesting fact is that a half century ago government funded R&amp;D was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the same as privately funded R&amp;D in the United States.  Today, private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; R&amp;D dwarfs government funded R&amp;D, and the gap has been growing steadily for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades.
</em><br>
<p>How much of this is basic science? How much is funded by charity
<br>
rather than business seeking to make a profit?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There may be good arguments that the government is better at some things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you will have to pick your examples more carefully than education and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthcare.  You simply assumed your conclusion without being cognizant of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the available evidence.
</em><br>
<p>In just about every field of human endeavour the US is, rightly or
<br>
wrongly, studied and copied around the world. Certainly this is so
<br>
with medical science. But in the *delivery* of health care, most
<br>
countries see the situation in the US as a warning of how not to do
<br>
it. This fact requires an explanation.
