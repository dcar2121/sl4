<p><p><em>&gt;  But this isn't a question about rational utility, it's a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  about ethics.  In my opinion, it's unethical to torture people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  regardless of whether that fits with what you're calling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;rational&quot; strategy.  In other words, if I get $1000 for torturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  random person in [Africa], and only $1 for not torturing them... you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  might say that rationally, I should chose the $1000.  But that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be unethical.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that I would call it unethical too, though I always
<br>
question the objective status of such claims. You and I
<br>
would simply strongly disapprove (a statement that has
<br>
no questionable elements in it so far as I can see) of
<br>
someone signing up to receive the $1000 here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another way to say this is that I've been programmed with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;friendliness meme&quot; at some point.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which causes me to behave &quot;irrationally&quot; according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your purely self-interest strategy.
</em><br>
<p>And you are quite right to put &quot;irrationally&quot; in scare
<br>
quotes because *rationality* so far as I know has
<br>
to be divorced from ethics, on pain of crossing the
<br>
is/ought boundary, which at best is incoherent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would argue that my behavior is not actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational, it's just that my goals involve more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than just simple self-interest.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly so!
<br>
