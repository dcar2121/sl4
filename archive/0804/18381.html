<em>&gt; You seem amazingly neutral about the meaning of such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts. Are you so sure that mathematics is meaningful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any of our inquiries if the real-world meanings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any terms used in the math are entirely arbitrary?
</em><br>
<p>Consciousness (in the sense of qualia or having experience) is irrelevant to
<br>
the function of the brain or any other computer.  However the belief in
<br>
consciousness is real and relevant, as it plays a role in the justification of
<br>
ethical decisions that people make.
<br>
<p>But the definition is arbitrary.  I might as well define an entity as
<br>
conscious if it has a name.  Thus, we name cats and dogs, but not chickens and
<br>
cows.  The Jetson's have a robot maid named Rosie, therefore it is conscious. 
<br>
This makes more sense than defining it as a mathematical property of
<br>
computation, which invariably leads to absurd conclusions, such as either
<br>
humans are not conscious or clouds of intergalactic dust are conscious (as the
<br>
last several hundred emails on this thread have argued).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But consciousness is just a distraction, a futile attempt to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extend our ethics to AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'm not quite sure why you consider it futile. After all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will sooner or later (assuming that things go well for you)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be in a position to choose certain outcomes at the expense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of certain other outcomes. Have you no desire for a guide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to which actions of yours will be consistent with other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions?  May I inquire as to whether you consider your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival beyond normal human lifespan to be possible, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if possible, desirable?
</em><br>
<p>I would like for my decision to upload or not to be based on real information
<br>
and not faith, like the suicide bomber who believes he will go to heaven. 
<br>
However, that is not the case.  All I can say with certainty is that after I
<br>
upload, there will be something that claims to be me that is realistic enough
<br>
to fool all of my friends and relatives.  The relevant facts are my fear of
<br>
death (therefore I will upload) and belief in consciousness (therefore I
<br>
believe that my future upload will be &quot;me&quot; if I preserve my memories).
<br>
<p>But every thought experiment I do proves that my beliefs are wrong.
<br>
<p>Example: teleportation.  It works like this.  I step into a booth at point A
<br>
and a copy of me is produced at point B.  The copy at point A is slowly and
<br>
painfully killed by being crushed between the soundproofed walls of the
<br>
teleportation booth in a process that takes 24 hours.  For $2 extra I have the
<br>
option of having the copy at point A injected with an overdose of a narcotic,
<br>
making the death fast and painless.  But I have teleported hundreds of times
<br>
both ways and can't tell the difference.  I always come out at point B and I
<br>
would rather save the money.
<br>
<p>Am I making the right decision?  My tribal elders can't help me.  They say
<br>
that consciousness can't be copied.
