<em>&gt; Yes, but the data (cross country and longitudinal from the moment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public education systems were installed) indicate that such a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has benefited, on average, everyone in the country by growing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy.
</em><br>
<p><p>Source? Perhaps this could be true for some nations and not others. I would
<br>
be surprised, for example, if mandating that the ethnically homogeneous
<br>
Swedes or Finns attend school together would  be problematic. But the US is
<br>
ethnically diverse, and there are conflicts when one tries to educate
<br>
different groups together. My Irish-German ethnic peers and I would be
<br>
painfully slow if we had to attend a *Juku*, if only because our parents
<br>
don't expect us to study as much. When low-achieving groups are integrated
<br>
with the average or above-average students through school districts
<br>
embracing multiple ethnicities, one often finds *de facto* segregation --
<br>
since they can't send their kids to different schools, parents just move
<br>
out.
<br>
<p>Are you comparing these benefits to the opportunity cost? Government schools
<br>
tend to keep people until they're 18 by default, even though many of these
<br>
people are better suited to manual labor or crafts rather than academic
<br>
study. Must we pay tens of thousands of dollars per student *per year* to
<br>
keep them out of the workforce and in a system that will teach them to
<br>
despise education?
<br>
<p>I'm not claiming that this is a necessary feature of government monopoly
<br>
education. Just that when you put things under the control of a giant
<br>
monopoly (whether or not it even bothers to do things for a profit) you get
<br>
consistent results -- if you don't happen to have a permanently perfect
<br>
system at the outset, you won't get improvements. If we had, say, a
<br>
competitive system rather than a giant monopoly, we might have faster
<br>
progress in education. By the way, the situation is not improved when this
<br>
giant monopoly buys its main product (low-quality labor from the bottom of
<br>
the academic barrel:

<p><em>&gt; Out of interest, since ideological points seem to be coming up here,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much trust would people put in a powerful FAI? If such an AI said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that your pet system was demonstrably inferior to an alternative,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you accept the verdict? Remember that on any issue where there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is expert disagreement (and education and healthcare is a case with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much expert disagreement), then it is plausible that the FAI would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide against you.
</em><br>
<p><p>I would be suspicious of an AI that had to persuade using the threat of
<br>
force, rather than either outsmarting us and paying us to obey or simply
<br>
persuading people. However, if the AI could carefully and cogently argue
<br>
that the only way humans will be truly happy is to concentrate power in the
<br>
hands of a few humans, and give them the power to imprison people who
<br>
disagree with their dictates, I would submit to this bizarre and unnatural
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>Or become a full-time terrorist. It's up in the air, at this point.
