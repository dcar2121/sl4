<p>The &quot;I&quot;'s and &quot;you&quot;'s stopped working, so I disambiguated the

pronouns.  I also called the new guys the &quot;horde&quot;, so I have a label
<br>
for them below.

<br>
<em>&gt;What would *you* do, if you were faced with this scenario? What would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be the best course of action?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From context, the question is how to do this right if I am trying to
</em><br>
be altruistic.  In real life, people aren't all that altruistic, so
<br>
the problem is simple.  If nothing better comes to mind, you throw the
<br>
exploiter in jail and institutionalize his brain-damaged horde. 
<br>
<p>If I'm altruistic, I care a certain amount about the exploiter.  Use
<br>
the symbol &quot;c&quot; (for &quot;compassion&quot;) to represent how much I care about
<br>
him.  I also have a coefficient that says how much I care about each
<br>
other person.  Those other coefficients may be more or less than c,
<br>
and they're used as weights in the obvious way.  None of these
<br>
coefficients are negative.
<br>
<p>If the exploiter is constructing a horde of contrived humans to
<br>
manipulate me, then the total amount I care for the exploiter and his
<br>
horde after he does the constructing will still be c.  I could let him
<br>
decide how to distribute the compassion, or I could simply give him c
<br>
and the new guys 0.  If I'm not sure who the exploiter is, or I don't
<br>
have a secure way to communicate with him to discover how he wants to
<br>
adjust the coefficient, then the last option looks best.
<br>
<p>This last alternative doesn't imply I'd mistreat the horde.  If I know
<br>
that the exploiter cares about them, and I care about the exploiter,
<br>
then my behavior toward the horde will still be compassionate.  I
<br>
would also treat them well if other people I cared about cared about
<br>
the horde.  It is not a special case to be compassionate toward
<br>
someone who is dead, so my kindness toward the horde would not be
<br>
dependent on the continued existence of the exploiter.
<br>
<p>(In reality, like other humans, I'm not all that altruistic or
<br>
rational, so I'm really talking from the point of view of some
<br>
hypothetical rational actor we might make someday.)
