<em>&gt;&gt; Are you totally neutral about the possibility of getting shot? If no,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the former includes the latter. If yes, please seek psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; help immediately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My abstract self is neutral about being shot, which my emotional self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finds disturbing.
</em><br>
<p>But after careful consideration, you are going to *act*, based on which?
<br>
<p>Will you or won't you, after careful consideration, get the $10M
<br>
for your frozen duplicate, given that only one instance of you can
<br>
persist? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At SL4, an upload would produce an entity with your memories that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claims to be you.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you mean that this is an SL4 question. Your statement
<br>
---as is---literally makes no sense. 
<br>
<p>Question 3:  After careful consideration, will you or won't you
<br>
upload if it necessarily involves destruction of your body?
<br>
<p>(Necessary qualifications, which should not be necessary:
<br>
99.9% of uploads prefer their new lives, no one except a
<br>
few philosophers still doubt that uploads are the same people
<br>
they were before, and many of your friends are asking you
<br>
to come.)
<br>
<p>I'm asking YOU, the one who after careful consideration
<br>
is going to do the acting. Enough of evasions involving
<br>
&quot;abstract self&quot; and &quot;emotional self&quot;. I want to know---
<br>
as I think other readers do---what you will *DO*,
<br>
after careful consideration, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry, there is no right answer because there are no axioms.
</em><br>
<p>No one is asking for provably right answers, Matt. In fact, no one
<br>
is asking for &quot;right answers&quot; period. We'd like to know what you
<br>
approve of---again, after careful consideration---and what
<br>
you think you would do, and what your reasons are or would be. 
<br>
<p>Lee
