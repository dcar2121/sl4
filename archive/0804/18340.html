</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I think that that is exactly true, though clearly some part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of me is *enjoying* something closely related. But yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it cannot be said that I am enjoying the visual experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  since according to me it is being looked up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It might be very much like someone who has gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  used to blindsight, but for whom medical examination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  proves that certain normal pathways have been blocked.
</em><br>
<p>People with blindsight behave as if they see things but lack visual
<br>
experiences. The opposite phenomenon is Anton's syndrome: some people
<br>
with lesions in their visual cortex believe they can see normally
<br>
while in fact they are blind. Combine the two conditions (although I
<br>
have never heard of an actual case) and you could have someone who is
<br>
blind, but behaves as if he can see normally and believes he can see
<br>
normally. This may seem a good candidate for zombie vision, but it
<br>
isn't so simple. Patients with Anton's syndrome are delusional, and
<br>
insist they can see even though they are continually walking into
<br>
things. This is an extra neuropsychiatric disability, not a direct
<br>
consequence of losing perception. If the rest of your brain is
<br>
functioning normally, losing visual pathways is not something that can
<br>
go unnoticed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Allow me to elaborate slightly. A rogue branch of the ANP
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (Australian National Police) is considering whether to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  A.  seize citizen Stathis Papaioannou and torture him
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      for an hour the old fashioned way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  B.  by fantastical means collect patches of dust in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     (Tegmark) infinite level one universe separated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     millions or trillions of lightyears, and load them    into memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequentially in such a manner that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the torture spoken of in (A) is apparently reproduced,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the sole difference being that there is no actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     causal connection between the states (which is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     important in my view)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  C. just save the time and expense of the loading part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of (B) and just leave them laying around in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     solar system here and there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  D. don't bother even doing (C), but leave them be,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and cause the normal Stathis metabolism to not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     operate for the hour, with only the memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     (i.e. the last state that has been collected in (B)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     being implanted and normally running resuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  At any rate, are you indifferent to A, B, C, and D?
</em><br>
<p>My mind is apparently closely connected to my brain, not to patches of
<br>
dust around the universe, and I worry a lot more about what happens to
<br>
my brain than about what happens to the dust. But if the whole
<br>
universe is actually a simulation in Platonia, all that means is that
<br>
the computations giving rise to my mind through the process laws of
<br>
physics -&gt; Big Bang -&gt; stars -&gt; planets -&gt; evolution of simple life
<br>
etc. have much higher measure than those giving rise to a disembodied
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>Given the above, case (A) is interpreted as the computations giving
<br>
rise to my mind taking an unpleasant turn for an hour. Case (B) is
<br>
equivalent, since the resulting brain would behave in exactly the same
<br>
way as in (A). But cases (C) and (D) are not constrained in any way to
<br>
be associated with my mind. They could represent any and every
<br>
computation, and the measure and kind of those computations in the
<br>
dust giving rise to my mind is the same as the measure and kind of
<br>
those computations in Platonia giving rise to my mind. The fact that
<br>
any computation can be mapped onto any physical process, even the null
<br>
state, is actually my justification for saying that every computation
<br>
is necessarily implemented in Platonia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I claim that the argument whereby if part of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain is replaced by the simulation you could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibly notice anything had changed *proves*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the simulation must be conscious in exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same way as biological tissue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes, and under the extremely hypothetical GLUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hypothesis, I disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If that's so then there is no *proof* that an upload will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be conscious in the same way as the original. You might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that it sounds reasonable, but ultimately you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to take it on faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It would be a very strong sort of faith, though, again for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the same reason.
</em><br>
<p>My problem is that without the fading qualia / partial zombification
<br>
argument as I have outlined I have no really persuasive reason to
<br>
believe that I would remain conscious in the same way as I am now if
<br>
my brain is replaced with a simulation running on a different
<br>
substrate. I welcome any other arguments you have might have to offer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You also have to admit that you might be at least partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a zombie right now, since feeling that you're all conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does not count as evidence that this is in fact the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Well, I don't think that that's something that I (or anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that was pretending to be me) could or would ever concede.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  For in the case at hand, where I am an evolutionarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  derived organism, we agree along with right thinking people everywhere  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that I'm conscious. On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  other hand, if I were just a GLUT with a tiny, simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  loader program, then since it would simulate (but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  emulate) me, then it too would erroneously announce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that it was conscious.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I know right now that I'm not a zombie, regardless of whether
<br>
anyone else believes me. What you're suggesting is that this special
<br>
personal knowledge might be unreliable: I may yet be a zombie, or a
<br>
partial zombie, despite feeling what I feel. But surely *at bottom*
<br>
consciousness must be this feeling that I have. If you come up with a
<br>
scientific theory that predicts what chemicals I will find salty, but
<br>
I taste one of these chemicals and find it sweet, then it is your
<br>
theory that is wrong and needs to be adjusted, not my taste
<br>
perception.
