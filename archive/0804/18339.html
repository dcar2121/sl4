<p>
Hum, my understanding of a GLUT was that you fed it the state of a
<br>
system, and it would give you the next one. Thus a GLUT is a function
<br>
on the states of a system; you feed it one state and it gives you
<br>
another.
<br>
<p>So S is my set of states (taken to be polynomials, for this example),
<br>
and G is a GLUT on S - a function from S to itself.
<br>
<p>(note: I don't actually want G to be full GLUT, but actually a simpler
<br>
rule, like differentiation; but we'll have to start with G being a
<br>
GLUT).
<br>
<p>G is therefore a collection of ordered pairs of elements of S (the
<br>
pairs are (initial state , resulting state). The KC of such a
<br>
collection is well defined.
<br>
<p>Now R is a rule, i.e. a restiction that the function G must obey. It
<br>
is given by an ordered collection of sets (P(n) = the &quot;n-th degree
<br>
polynomials&quot;), and the rule that G must map P(n) to P(n-1)).
<br>
<p>Now the maximal KC that G can have, given this rule, is huge.
<br>
Formulating the rule R itself is of trivial KC; the process of taking
<br>
a polynomial and sending it to its degree is also of trivial KC. In
<br>
fact I have just, completely defined it in a few sentences, no matter
<br>
what the cardinality of S is.
<br>
<p>Now we have a hash function f, mapping bijectively to the set f(S). By
<br>
the composition f G f^{-1} , we have a function (a GLUT) mapping f(S)
<br>
to itself. I called it f(G).
<br>
<p>We also have the &quot;rule&quot; f(R). This is given by the requirement that
<br>
f(G) must map f(P(n)) to f(P(n-1)). That statement is of trivial KC.
<br>
But given an element p of f(S), knowing whether it is in f(P(n)) is of
<br>
very high KC: to do so, we need to calculate f^{-1}(p), and the KC of
<br>
f is maximal.
<br>
<p>Thus the rule f(R) is of high KC, as it requires a lot of information
<br>
to describe.
<br>
<p>With me so far?
