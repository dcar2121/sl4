Keep in mind, the only possible hypothetical simulator that could prod a
<br>
UFAI into acting somewhat friendly would (by definition) be a Friendly AI.
<br>
Any action we take which reduces the probability of an FAI would also reduce
<br>
the probability that a UFAI would be motivated by the possible existence of
<br>
an FAI.
<br>
<p>I think we're better off building an FAI, but it's a valid technical
<br>
question that should ideally be discussed more. If you (or anyone else) want
<br>
to create a model that shows in what universes and under what assumptions
<br>
building an FAI is a good or bad idea given AI Deterrence concerns, feel
<br>
free to submit it to my AI Beliefs blog, or better yet write a peer-reviewed
<br>
paper about it.

<p><em>&gt; Remember rolf's idea from a while back, the cooperation with hypothetical

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It recently occurs to me that if this thinking is true, it may actually be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better NOT to attempt friendly AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As was noted earlier, if friendliness is something that will crop up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spontaneously through cooperation with a hypothetical average of possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulators, some of which are friendly via being correctly programmed, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it naturally follows FAI isn't necessary. What went unnoticed is that it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually be more dangerous to attempt it than not to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we make an unfriendly AI that wants to make pancakes, and doesn't care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about humanity, then it will (theoretically) cooperate with possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulators by being friendly anyway. It's no skin off its nose if humanity's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems get solved and they live in blissful ascension and get free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; t-shirts, as long as they don't get in the way of pancake production much.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if we try to make a friendly AI, and we get it a bit wrong, such that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say, it's built to eliminate suffering but its definition of suffering is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too extensive and includes virtually all forms of thought, then it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very well NOT cooperate, because letting humanity survive is in direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violation of its primary goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, it seems to me we have a chinese finger trap situation, where it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safer to make an indifferent AI that will have nothing against cooperating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with possible higher friendly AIs than it is to try to make an actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly AI and fail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As things currently stand, I think this is something that should be taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very seriously.
