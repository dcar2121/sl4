<em>&gt; But my point was, at least teleportation where the original is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  instantaneously destroyed should be uncontroversial, being more or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  less equivalent to walking. Strange things happen when we grapple with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  weird duplication scenarios using brains that have evolved to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  absolutely that there can only ever be one copy of us travelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  forward through time.
</em><br>
<p>Expecting anything to be &quot;uncontroversial&quot; is very optimistic :-)
<br>
<p>A whole raft of things are banned not because they are morally wrong,
<br>
but because they are very similar to things that are wrong, or could
<br>
lead to such things (cloning, Euthenasia, pyramid schemes, etc...)
<br>
<p>The teleportation debate could play out both ways; if the governments
<br>
and enough private entities start using destructive teleportation (DT)
<br>
before any law comes out against them, then DT will be entrenched,
<br>
economically necessary, and will be regulated but never banned.
<br>
Especially once enough people have used it themselves.
<br>
<p>If the initial technology is difficult and expensive to use, if some
<br>
mistakes are made (eg: the original not immediately killed), if scare
<br>
stories come out to the press before DT comes into common use - then
<br>
it will be banned.
<br>
<p>A crucial aspect of public acceptance will be, I believe, whether the
<br>
copying process must inevitably destroy the original. If that's the
<br>
case, acceptance will be easier.
<br>
<p>Curiously, after reading all these posts, I'm moving more towards the
<br>
&quot;ban destructive teleportation&quot; side :-) The reason is simple:
<br>
murdering someone who knows they are about to be murdered and doesn't
<br>
want to be is very high on my list of ethically monsterous actions.
<br>
Destructive teleportation, in principle, is equivalent to walking up
<br>
from a chair. In practice, it is very close to the above murder - just
<br>
one error away.
<br>
<p>Since legal decisions are not little bottles on isolated shelves, I
<br>
feel very uncomfortable with an action that is legal and fine
<br>
&quot;provided the subject does not wake up&quot; but is illegal if he does.
<br>
Seeing what actions the brain does even when asleep, talk about legal
<br>
gray area!
<br>
<p>(nb: torture is not a legal problem for teleportation or even memory
<br>
erasure, I believe. Rather simple legal procedures can be installed to
<br>
deal with that).
<br>
