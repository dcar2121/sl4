And then what? There are drugs out there, meditations techniques and so

on that can bring you to intensely ecstatic states, some quite long 
<br>
lasting if you work at it. Is it enough? Perhaps for some people for 
<br>
some time. But I very much doubt we would all hardwire ourselves to such 
<br>
a point we couldn't do anything much else except bliss out. I speak from 
<br>
some modest experience.
<br>
<p>I think it much more likely a Fermi Paradox explanation that very very 
<br>
few intelligent evolved species overcome enough of their EP and evolved 
<br>
limitations fast enough to deal with the complexity explosion pre-AGI. 
<br>
AGI comes too late as their increasingly interdependent world too 
<br>
complex for their collective intelligence spirals out of control and 
<br>
takes them down. For a variety of reasons I think this is the most 
<br>
likely outcome by far for any such species.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I’ll just change the mean happiness quotient in my code from a 5 to a 6,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oh yes that’s much better, I wonder what a 7 would feel like, wow that
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The trouble is if you’re perfectly happy right now then you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentive to do anything because things are perfect already so any
</em><br>

</em><br>
How does that follow? I can be perfectly delighted including delighted 
<br>
that I can see a way to make the world even more wonderful and spread 
<br>
the delight I feel to more people. Being perfectly happy is not 
<br>
synonymous with their being nothing left you would love to do or see 
<br>
changed. We can be perfectly happy with a lot that is far from perfect 
<br>
around us.
