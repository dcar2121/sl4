<br>
<em>&gt;The two big large contributors to progress have been (i) Rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Law (ii) Respect for Private Property.  These clearly apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only to humans. Cows, for example, cannot understand either,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and they have no private property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This thread started when the need for a line to be drawn was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realized. I've drawn that line in my previous post, and here I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defend it. Questions?
</em><br>
<p>Okay, here's a question -- Do you know a way to do something like
<br>
Hutter's AIXI that has the concept of respect for private property
<br>
built in?
<br>
<p>Actually, here's an easier question: can you express the concept of
<br>
private property formally?  (This omits the part about respecting it,
<br>
and it lets you pick the formalism.)
<br>
<p>There are weird property-like things, like water rights, stock
<br>
options, and patents.  A correct solution will have some process for
<br>
deciding who owns various parts of the moon, by the time it makes a
<br>
practical difference.  Partial solutions are welcome.
<br>
<p>I think I've done this for human desire on my web site below.  I would
<br>
really like to be able to say &quot;rule of law&quot; or &quot;property rights&quot; with
<br>
those primitives, but I don't know where to start.  Thus I have a
<br>
theoretical AI that doesn't care about rule of law or respect for
<br>
private property, but it does care about giving people what they want.
<br>
I didn't expect to end up advocating communism.  :-(.
