</em><br>
<p>I have known several different pairs of identical twins, so yes... I
<br>
am fully aware of what an identical twin is.  My whole point is that
<br>
different copies made of someone are not the same person.  They are in
<br>
no way interchangeable (just like the twins) when you are incorrectly
<br>
saying that they are.  They are different persons with different
<br>
livelihoods.  They just happen to share some (but not all) memories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  What keeps these discussions from boiling down to being &quot;incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  boring&quot;, as you write, is that *actions* will depend on our views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The main point is to properly prescribe actions. The chief such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  action that you have to decide (or will have to decide when uploaded),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (and need to decide now if you want to be philosophically prepared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for all eventualities) can be seen from this following example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          An exact molecular duplicate of you was created
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          ten minutes ago and lies in the next room frozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          in a cask of ice. On top the cask of ice is a briefcase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          containing $10M dollars. The choice facing you (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          version, instance, who is now breathing and conscious)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          is (A) to undergo disintegration, in which your ten-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          minute-ago duplicate is resurrected and the money
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          becomes his (i.e. in my view, yours), or whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          frozen copy in the other room is disintegrated (along
</em><br>
<em>&gt;          with the $10M).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Please tell me what you would do in this situation.  If you make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sensible decision, then yes, we are only arguing terminology.
</em><br>
<p>Assuming I could trust the people who were supposedly going to revive
<br>
the copy with the $10M, it's a no brainer... I would disintegrate and
<br>
let the copy wake up and have $10M dollars.    I've explained why in
<br>
my earlier post on &quot;objective anticipation&quot;.
<br>
<p>Hopefully, this is the decision you're calling &quot;sensible&quot;.  So do you
<br>
agree now that arguing about personal identity is entirely about
<br>
language and mostly a waste of time?
