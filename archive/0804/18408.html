<p><em>&gt;  &gt; The process of walking from A to B results in the copy at A painlessly

<em>&gt;  &gt; vanishing from the universe and another copy appearing at B. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; what ordinary survival from moment to moment is all about. So if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; form of transport such as destructive teleportation reproduces this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; process, I wouldn't worry about it. But if some new form of walking is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; discovered which leaves a copy at A to be slowly crushed, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; equivalent to your non-destructive teleportation scenario, that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; be worrying indeed. This is because with two copies extant at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; time, I have a subjectively 1/2 chance of becoming either of the two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; In a sense I don't really &quot;become&quot; my copy even if there's only one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; them, but I feel as if I do because that's the way my brain has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; evolved to think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, this is the same problem as the quantum coin.  Subjective expectation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rational agents requires multiple trials and counting outcomes.  If you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  copied 100 times when a coin comes up heads, then there is a subjective 99%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  chance of heads because after multiple trials that is what you are most likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to remember.  In the case of teleportation I end up at point B every time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  independent of the method used to kill the copy at A.  If you believe you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  might be tortured, then that belief is based on faith rather than experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Faith says that you are going to step into a booth and be crushed with 100%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  probability, so you will probably pay the $2.  But after repeating enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  times and always ending up at B, you will at some point decide to save the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you prefer, think of teleportation as equivalent to being tortured and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  having the memory of the torture erased.  This has zero utility to a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agent because there is no change in mental state.
</em><br>
<p>But my point was, at least teleportation where the original is
<br>
instantaneously destroyed should be uncontroversial, being more or
<br>
less equivalent to walking. Strange things happen when we grapple with
<br>
weird duplication scenarios using brains that have evolved to believe
<br>
absolutely that there can only ever be one copy of us travelling
<br>
forward through time.
