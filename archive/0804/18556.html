</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories?
</em><br>
<p>I had to think about it for awhile, but I would say about $50 per hour.
<br>
<p>I have to consider two factors.  First, memory has value because it is how I
<br>
adapt to the environment.  Losing memory means making more mistakes.
<br>
<p>Second, the desire to learn is part of the utility function I inherited
<br>
because it caused my ancestors to have more children.  It works a bit
<br>
differently, in that the prospect of having my memories replaced with somebody
<br>
else's and losing my identity has negative utility for me (even though I would
<br>
be unaware of it afterwards).  Logically it should not matter as long as the
<br>
other person was equally well adapted.  But that's the utility function I
<br>
have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; On close analysis, our logic leads us to absurdities such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teleportation example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you assume that everyone knows what you're talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope you can be more explicit from now on. There is nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absurd about teleportation in principle, and after we're uploaded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one might routinely teleport from one machine to another, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the other is on another planet.
</em><br>
<p>Well, issues like consciousness, copying, and uploading have been discussed
<br>
endlessly.  You can check the archives.  I don't want to rehash them.  But to
<br>
summarize, there is no physical bases for the existence of consciousness or
<br>
qualia; there is just a universal (inherited) belief among humans that it
<br>
exists.  If you are copied or uploaded, all you can say for certain is that
<br>
there will be something with your memories that claims to be you.  Arguing
<br>
whether your consciousness actually transfers to the copy is just pointless
<br>
nonsense.  Only the universal hope that it does transfer is relevant, because
<br>
*that* will guide the design of AI.
