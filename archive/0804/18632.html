<em>&gt; The distinction that humans commonly make is that if you communicate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using language, then it is not yourself.  Thus, a person with two faces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share the same brain is one person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4549608">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=4549608</a>
</em><br>
<p><p>I use language to communicate to my future self all the time. There is a
<br>
continuum, here: a note-to-self might say &quot;finish the books,&quot; whereas the
<br>
same information communicated to an outside party would be &quot;finish
<br>
alphabetizing the books.&quot; And since I articulate some thoughts as language,
<br>
this argument would also imply that I've been multiple people since I
<br>
learned to speak.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a more flexible and applicable version of this theory could involve
<br>
how much compression one can get away with in communicating. A note to self
<br>
can be extremely terse; a note to a close friend can be brief; a note to a
<br>
total stranger with a poor grasp of English could take many pages to explain
<br>
the alphabetizing task above. And this dovetails with the earlier argument:
<br>
when you're punching cards, your computer is quite 'other'; when you're
<br>
using a higher-level language to quickly parse a huge amount of information
<br>
without having to consciously go through lots of tedious processes, the
<br>
computer is more of an extension of the self. And as more of the stuff we do
<br>
can be expressed algorithmically, saved, and used or modified at will, we
<br>
get closer to just being as terse with the computer as we are with
<br>
ourselves.
