2008/4/30 Krekoski Ross &lt;<a href="mailto:rosskrekoski@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Happy%20Box">rosskrekoski@gmail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if we, in the process, modify our higher-order mind? Its not a trivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought-- while I think there would be emergent similarities in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent life, there are two things to keep in mind: 1) that these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *emergent* similarities, and still dependant upon the overall architecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the organism.  2) the desire to stay alive as an individual or as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species is, with a very high degree of probability, a genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predisposition. If we start modifying things, we may find that we dont
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly care about continuation as an individual.
</em><br>
<p>If my top level goal is X, then any modification I knowingly make will
<br>
be consistent with X; I won't make myself suicidal unless I already
<br>
think being suicidal is a desirable state of mind. Of course, it is
<br>
possible that I accidentally make myself suicidal due to being unable
<br>
to see all the consequences of my modifications, but there are such
<br>
risks in any endeavour that isn't completely predictable, which is
<br>
covers almost everything worthwhile.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess though that it brings up a big question: Is a brain (or a computer)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of understanding itself in its full complexity, or is the capacity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for intelligence that emerges from a system only capable of understanding a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subset of the system itself. (think godel). If the former, we should have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with modifying ourselves. If the latter, self-modification by any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent system is potentially dangerous in the long term, and the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'stable' means by which intelligence can increase is either analogous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution in some respects, or very very slow incremental change.    I guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one question that we could ask to address the question is: &quot;is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent system capable of perfect simulation of itself?&quot; I dont know if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theres a really good answer, the only solution I can think of that uses the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metaphor of current technology is an OS emulating a copy of itself within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the OS, but then of course, the emulated OS is not itself emulating an OS,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so you run into recursive problems.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why it should be any riskier to make changes by
<br>
self-modification than through gradual change. Problems such as drug
<br>
addiction and obesity occur precisely because our evolved drives have
<br>
no hope of keeping up with the modern world. People can easily predict
<br>
and understand the consequences of overeating, desperately want to
<br>
stop overeating, but still can't overcome the drive to eat. Not being
<br>
able to foresee all the consequences of reducing appetite should be a
<br>
minor consideration when weighed up against the destructive effects of
<br>
our evolutionary programming.
