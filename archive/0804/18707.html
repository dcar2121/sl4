<p>
Remember rolf's idea from a while back, the cooperation with hypothetical
<br>
simulators via newcomb's paradox such and such theory?
<br>
<p>It recently occurs to me that if this thinking is true, it may actually be
<br>
better NOT to attempt friendly AI.
<br>
<p>As was noted earlier, if friendliness is something that will crop up
<br>
spontaneously through cooperation with a hypothetical average of possible
<br>
simulators, some of which are friendly via being correctly programmed, then
<br>
it naturally follows FAI isn't necessary. What went unnoticed is that it may
<br>
actually be more dangerous to attempt it than not to.
<br>
<p>If we make an unfriendly AI that wants to make pancakes, and doesn't care
<br>
about humanity, then it will (theoretically) cooperate with possible
<br>
simulators by being friendly anyway. It's no skin off its nose if humanity's
<br>
problems get solved and they live in blissful ascension and get free
<br>
t-shirts, as long as they don't get in the way of pancake production much.
<br>
<p>But if we try to make a friendly AI, and we get it a bit wrong, such that,
<br>
say, it's built to eliminate suffering but its definition of suffering is
<br>
too extensive and includes virtually all forms of thought, then it might
<br>
very well NOT cooperate, because letting humanity survive is in direct
<br>
violation of its primary goal.
<br>
<p>So, it seems to me we have a chinese finger trap situation, where it's safer
<br>
to make an indifferent AI that will have nothing against cooperating with
<br>
possible higher friendly AIs than it is to try to make an actual friendly AI
<br>
and fail.
<br>
<p>As things currently stand, I think this is something that should be taken
<br>
very seriously.
