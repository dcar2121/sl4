<p>
For the duration of this thread, assume that FAI is the best use of
<br>
time and resources for a rational altruist. How should resources be
<br>
prioritized, in terms of marginal utility? Here are my current
<br>
thoughts.
<br>
<p>My prioritization:
<br>
<p>1. Outreach to mathematically-talented students and recent graduates.
<br>
We know that some tiny minority of people exist who will self-motivate
<br>
to help with FAI after a quick exposure to these talking points:
<br>
<p>* AGI may be possible within the next few decades
<br>
<p>* AGI can be dangerous. Suppose you initially give an AI the goal of
<br>
making paperclips, with the plan that you will shut the AI down or
<br>
modify its goals once you decide you have &quot;enough paperclips.&quot;
<br>
However, the AI would rather replace the Earth with paperclips
<br>
according to its current goal, so it will spontaneously form a subgoal
<br>
of preventing you from being willing and able to shut it off or
<br>
rewrite its goals.
<br>
<p>* Extremely few people are addressing this problem, for example, most
<br>
people building an AGI do not put a high priority taking this danger
<br>
into account.
<br>
<p>* From a utilitarian point of view, this Friendly AI problem is
<br>
probably the best use of your time and resources, even compared with
<br>
other direly under-addressed problems in society.
<br>
<p>Have a reasonable percentage of the most talented students been
<br>
exposed to these talking points? Until the answer to that question is
<br>
&quot;yes&quot;, my current belief is that this is the best marginal use of
<br>
resources.
<br>
<p>2.  Publish a technical document, or better yet a computer program,
<br>
that would produce a Friendly outcome, given infinite computing
<br>
resources. Presumably such a program would not significantly help
<br>
someone to accidentally build a UFAI, but would provide evidence of
<br>
whether the FAI community has reached some level of convergence as to
<br>
the desired outcome.
<br>
<p>3.  Put interested people to work solving, on an algorithmic level,
<br>
the problems of how to create an FAI with limited computer resources.
<br>
<p>4.  Track who is working on an AGI, and what evidence there is that
<br>
they will or won't succeed.
<br>
<p>5.  Determine what the current fundamental (causal) points of
<br>
disagreement are with and between other AI researchers.
