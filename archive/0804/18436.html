</em><br>
<p>Perhaps it is better to say that what has evolved is a feeling rather
<br>
than a belief. I have the feeling that the floor is always down and
<br>
the ceiling always up, and my naive scientific theory to explain this
<br>
is that there is an absolute up and down in the universe. Then someone
<br>
takes me for a ride in a spacecraft and I have to admit that my theory
<br>
is wrong. But this has no impact at all on the fact that I get dizzy
<br>
if the floor and ceiling are constantly swapping roles, so I use my
<br>
new knowledge to request of the pilot that he accelerate in a constant
<br>
direction to restore the illusion of absolute up and down that my
<br>
brain is used to. It's the same with duplication: I know that both
<br>
copies have equal claim to being &quot;me&quot;, but this doesn't change the
<br>
fact that it *feels* as if I become one or other copy with 1/2
<br>
probability.
