<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you really expect us to believe that it's identically the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; same to you whether they do it to you or do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; some random African?  You really don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; that there is a fact of the matter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I hear that.  It would certainly make a difference to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, at least you and I (and I think the vast majority)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree on that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To add on, suppose that you love X, and right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before an extremely painful operation, you express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathy for X and tell her so. Would you be lying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you then added &quot;of course, whether it's you who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergoes the pain or some random African is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually indifferent to me&quot;?  Or would that be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth (however hurtful the statement itself might be)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
What the heck does &quot;love&quot; mean if it does not mean that I esteem the 
<br>
person I love more than random other persons that I may not even know?   
<br>
And why would I say such a thing?  What pain is not handled by 
<br>
anesthesia and by drugs and other means afterwards was unavoidable in 
<br>
reality.  Why should a hypothetical that is far removed from reality or 
<br>
relevance in the circumstance even come up?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Even if I want to degrade someone I would want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them to remember that also.  Otherwise, whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is the point?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, as you know, some people wish to degrade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others for sexual gratification. There are probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people who you and I would equally condemn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who might wish to degrade others in various ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is the point.  To these people, it may in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be very convenient that the victim remembers nothing.
</em><br>
That it is convenient to some types of molesters makes what point exactly? 
<br>
<em>&gt; I suggest that though (agreeing with Matt) it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be better for them to not remember some hideous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing that happened to them, that by *no means*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removes (a) the fact that something terrible did happen to them and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) *your* evident concern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the *act* itself of so degrading them was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despicable.  I agree with you, but your (b) was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the point Matt and I were discussing (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think agreeing upon).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
OK.  It is better not to remember things that are just stupid [without 
<br>
real meaning] painful incidents as a generality. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of Matt's next questions was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.  Is it ethical to rape someone and then erase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;      their memories completely (or fix them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;      afterwards so that they believe it never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;      happened, or they have a blackout)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Likewise, it is not ethical (by which, as I have said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I mean little more than &quot;I disapprove&quot; or &quot;we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; customarily disapprove or we should disapprove&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Samantha says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I mean a great deal more than that.  To force the will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of another intelligent being in such a brutish fashion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; makes one obviously unfit for society. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a claim that depends on your particular society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In some societies, exactly the reverse made people unfit.  
</em><br>
So what.  I am not talking about what some &quot;society&quot; held.  I am talking 
<br>
about [or trying to] what is and is not conducive to humans living 
<br>
together well. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Recall the Viking who refused to pinion English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; babies on the end of his sword and swing them about.
</em><br>
Not relevant to what I was attempting to point out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The other Vikings thought this very strange, and it probably lessened 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his status among them. But I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I agree totally with the general sentiment of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are saying.   But very objectively speaking, it comes down to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little more than you and I and almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone in our society today disapproving most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strenuously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Matt's subsequent query:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5.  Would you be upset if someone started torturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       you and then said &quot;don't worry, I've made a backup
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       of your brain and I will use it to make an exact copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       of you on my home planet, as soon as I figure out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       how to do so... which should only take a few years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       I'm not going to torture your copy when it wakes up,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       so it's fine if I torture you now. In fact, I'm going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       kill you soon so it won't matter at all.  Your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;       copy won't remember any of this.&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Naturally [I, Lee, responded] , that would be terrible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; The proper way to look at it is to sum over all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; instances of your runtime, and try to evaluate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; preferences accordingly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; WHAT??  I don't need to sum over any instances to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; condemn such behavior toward or by any and all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; my instances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But someone might ask you &quot;why?&quot;. It seems to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your most logical response---since you and I do certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and heartily agree on the answer---would be along the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines that &quot;overall benefit for me (Samantha)&quot; would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly lowered by such an outcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But honestly, it seems to me that you are more interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in *condemning* the act itself rather than the outcome of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the act.  Of course, the two are indeed normally tied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together, so I don't blame you.  It's just that it's interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me to note that the righteousness of behavior appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be much more important than the evaluation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual results of actions. You might be interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Socrates' ancient question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Ethics is about acts themselves or at least what I think of as ethics is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;           Would it be better to be perfectly unjust and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           yet be regarded by everyone in society as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           perfectly just, or better to be perfectly just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           and yet be regarded by all as perfectly unjust?
</em><br>
It would be better to have something more fruitful to do with our time.  
<br>
