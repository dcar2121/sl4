<p>I don't know why you and Lee both thought that I was saying that
<br>
identical twins were not distinct individuals.  My whole point is that
<br>
you should not treat two distinct individuals like they're the same
<br>
person.  Lee is trying to treat his copies as if they are the same
<br>
person, when they are different distinct individuals.  I merely
<br>
compared it to the identical twins situation to illustrate how bad it
<br>
is to make such a mistake.  I'm sure the two individuals in question
<br>
would be highly offended to be thought of as the same person.
