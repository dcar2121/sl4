From: &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sjatkins@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20What%20if%20there's%20an%20expiration%20date?%20(was%20Re:%20Arbitrarily%20decide%20who%20benefits)">sjatkins@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;Why would we believe we have the ability to determine the &quot;final ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system&quot; of entities many orders of magnitude smarter than us not to mention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;able to self-improve indefinitely?   We have some leverage in the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goal system.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the standard argument for this is that rational entities act to
<br>
preserve their goal system.  Otherwise they'd be doing something in
<br>
the future that's different from what they presently want done then.
<br>
So the initial goal system is the final goal system.
<br>
<p>Has anyone tried to formalize this?  It doesn't make sense when I look
<br>
at it closely.  For example, my scheme [1] has an expiration date.  It
<br>
takes action to optimize its utility function at a specific time
<br>
that's determined at the beginning, and when it's done, it's done.  It
<br>
might then have set up some mechanism to be run again with a different
<br>
expiration date, or the humans might decide to start it again, or it
<br>
or the humans might run something else.  Any of these possibilities,
<br>
if they happen, would be a natural consequence of the AI having put
<br>
the world into the state it thinks best at the expiration date, not a
<br>
continuation of the planning process it was doing before the
<br>
expiration date.
<br>
<p>If there's no expiration date, I'm concerned about indefinitely
<br>
deferred gratification, where the AI is always putting off giving
<br>
people what they want so it give them more of what they want later in
<br>
the case where it thinks it can invest the utility points better than
<br>
the humans.
