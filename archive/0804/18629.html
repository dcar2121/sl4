controls a dog -- one party pays for food, shelter, and health care, and in
<br>
return the other party does roughly what it would do anyway. In a computing
<br>
context, this could work if a computer were able to, for example, rope lots
<br>
of humans into paying for new hardware, and persuade them to lend it other

resources, in which case it would devote a tiny fraction of its resources to
<br>
amusing them in characteristic ways.
