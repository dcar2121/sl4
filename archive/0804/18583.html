<p><p>Not really.  There is no evidence to support this assertion, just the  
<br>
assertion itself.
<br>
<p>The United States did not have universal public education until well  
<br>
into the 20th century, yet for most of its history it had the highest  
<br>
literacy rate in the world by a remarkable margin.  Its robust private  
<br>
education system was destroyed for purely political reasons, and the  
<br>
consequence is that we pay orders of magnitude more per student today  
<br>
for an arguably inferior education.  At least the US still has its  
<br>
universities.
<br>
<p>As for healthcare, I would make the observation while the last major  
<br>
industrialized country with a quasi-private system standing is the  
<br>
United States, the United States also enjoys significantly better  
<br>
diagnostic accuracy and disease survival rates than any other  
<br>
industrialized country.  As was highlighted in a recent Lancet  
<br>
Oncology Journal study, the average cancer survival rate in the United  
<br>
States is 20-40% higher (depending on the type of cancer) than in  
<br>
Europe and the best in the world by any absolute measure.  Those are  
<br>
results that matter, since we are paying for healthcare results and  
<br>
not feel-good platitudes.  Add to that the fact that the vast majority  
<br>
of medical research happens in the US disproportionate to either its  
<br>
population or GDP and everyone benefits from its marginally private  
<br>
status.
<br>
<p>An interesting fact is that a half century ago government funded R&amp;D  
<br>
was about the same as privately funded R&amp;D in the United States.   
<br>
Today, private R&amp;D dwarfs government funded R&amp;D, and the gap has been  
<br>
growing steadily for decades.
<br>
<p><p>There may be good arguments that the government is better at some  
<br>
things, but you will have to pick your examples more carefully than  
<br>
education and healthcare.  You simply assumed your conclusion without  
<br>
being cognizant of the available evidence.
