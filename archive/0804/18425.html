</em><br>
<p>Well, having not yet read the others' replies, let me venture
<br>
an answer.
<br>
<p>We probably should try to conform our answer to &quot;what is a self&quot;
<br>
as close as we can to our answers to similar ontological items,
<br>
e.g., &quot;what is a democracy&quot;, &quot;what is a star&quot;, &quot;what is a tree&quot;,
<br>
and so on. 
<br>
<p>It's not hard to deconstruct the notion of self or even democracy,
<br>
and those who really get into it manage to deconstruct our notions
<br>
of &quot;stars&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;, whatever they want. Of course, they
<br>
then either become incoherent by wrecking all their sentences
<br>
by utterly silly qualifiers, or you can no longer get them to communicate
<br>
sensibly (according to their own standards) at all.
<br>
<p>The answer to *all* of the what-are questions above, is, IMO,
<br>
very much the same.  The answer is &quot;similarity of structure&quot;.
<br>
For example, we say that two stars are both &quot;G2&quot; if enough
<br>
isomorphism can be found among their different layers (see
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star</a>
<br>
where the term &quot;layer&quot; is mentioned at least a dozen times.
<br>
<p>If two biological items that we think both may be trees are
<br>
considered, then we decide what &quot;a tree is&quot; by first, a 
<br>
morphological analysis, which in the 20th century, was
<br>
extended down to the DNA, which then facilitated a
<br>
discovery of the evolutionary sequence. So Linnaeus
<br>
worked on morphological similarity, and today we compare
<br>
strands of DNA for similarity.
<br>
<p>Of course we should do that for selves, i.e. &quot;what is a self&quot;.
<br>
Suppose that we made an exact molecule for molecule
<br>
copy of a tree. Everyone will (or should!) agree that &quot;that's
<br>
exactly the same tree, except for location&quot;. 
<br>
<p>So, I say, it is will persons and selves. &quot;That's exactly the
<br>
same person&quot;, we should say, upon the instant of duplication.
<br>
And---just as two trees may begin to differ depending on,
<br>
say, how much water or sunlight or good soil they subsequently
<br>
get---so the entities, initially the same person, begin gradually
<br>
to become different, just as the trees do. That's the logical,
<br>
scientific way that would automatically be accepted by anyone.
<br>
Except for one small detail:
<br>
<p>People then begin imagining the *subjectivities* involved, and
<br>
even though we have grown up with the idea that we often
<br>
err on subjective matters, they just can't grasp the nettle and
<br>
admit that their subjective impressions are WRONG. It's
<br>
perfectly clear from a physical inspection, and objective
<br>
inspection, of all the facts, that the same answer should be
<br>
provided, whether it's &quot;trees&quot;, &quot;democracies&quot;, or &quot;persons&quot;,
<br>
or &quot;selves&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Despite sounding like some kind of koan, should a baby
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn that its room is part of its self?
</em><br>
<p>I think that that would be less than useful, despite Dawkins'
<br>
&quot;extended phenotype&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should the presence or absence of caregivers be included
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the definition of self?
</em><br>
<p>We should avoid *like the plague* all the futile efforts to 
<br>
fix upon exact definitions!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do we call the intersection of multiple self-centric sets?
</em><br>
<p>An image I like to use is configuration space, (or &quot;phase space&quot;).
<br>
A person then can be thought of as a fuzzy sphere in the space
<br>
of all algorithms, and his or her life as a trajectory through that
<br>
space. The conception works well in physics, and I think that
<br>
it works well here in the philosophy of personal identity too.
<br>
<p>So, perhaps the answer you want is that someone who was
<br>
intermediate between you and George Bush would be some
<br>
tiny region in the intersection of those two fuzzy sets? Just
<br>
as we can morph images, someday we may be able to merge
<br>
or even morph memories. There could be a creature in
<br>
principle who remembers being you and being George Bush
<br>
in many different ways, with many possible memories deleted
<br>
(i.e. many different flavors). I'm not sure what the best term
<br>
would be. Some analogy would arise in the language that 
<br>
would be fitting and natural.
