<em>&gt;&gt; I have reviewed Shock Levels.  There is currently nothing that mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mortals may discuss that is SL4.  I spent a long time waiting for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discussion that was truly on-topic for the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Is it even possible for an SL4 thread to be discussed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'll wait for an SL4 topic before posting again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also reviewed <a href="http://www.sl4.org/shocklevels.html">http://www.sl4.org/shocklevels.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will try.  First I adjust my belief system:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Consciousness does not exist. There is no &quot;me&quot;. The brain is a computer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Are you a relatively independent and autonomous computational unit?  
<br>
Then you doubtless have a model of the unit you are relative to other 
<br>
units and groups of various characteristics as well as the containing 
<br>
environment.  Thus you have some type of self-concept. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 2. Free will does not exist. The brain executes an algorithm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
As a rational intelligence you run various algorithms with or without 
<br>
active consciousness of the running (tracing?) that choose the best of 
<br>
sets of alternatives consistent with your goals within 
<br>
computational/time/resource limits.  As you are free to run the 
<br>
algorithms and act on their outcome and further free to examine your 
<br>
algorithms and implementations and other possible algorithms you are to 
<br>
that extent a being of &quot;free will&quot;.    You are also free to develop your 
<br>
knowledge base and reality model to the best of your initiative within 
<br>
your limits.  You are even free to consider the validity and limitation 
<br>
of you current goals and understanding of them.   This looks like quite 
<br>
a bit of freedom and a singular lack of coercion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. There is no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, just ethical beliefs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
&quot;Ethical&quot; is all about defining relative &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in a hopefully 
<br>
grounded fashion.   Specifically it is about what is good or bad for 
<br>
your best functioning and success in achieving your goals in your 
<br>
context which includes other goal seeking intelligent entities.
<br>
<em>&gt; I can only do this in an abstract sense.  I pretend there is a version of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that thinks in this strict mathematical sense while the rest of me pursues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normal human goals in a world that makes sense.  
</em><br>
How are your normal human goals not the result of unconscious algorithms 
<br>
and goal structures?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is the only way I can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  Otherwise I would have no reason to live.  Fortunately human biases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favoring survival are strong, so I can do this safely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
What is this &quot;I&quot; that would have no reason to live?  Isn't it already a 
<br>
construct you have defined to included things that are critical to the 
<br>
construct and that it thus that it could not survive without?  But other 
<br>
constructs of &quot;I&quot; or self-image might work perfectly fine without some 
<br>
of these elements. You also might find that the non-human being you 
<br>
attempted to portray above in fact has most of those characteristics 
<br>
that are important to your construct but seen a different way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My abstract self concludes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I am not a singularitarian.  I want neither to speed up the singularity nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delay it.  In the same sense I am neutral about the possibility of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinction (see 3).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
You are perhaps not a singularitarian, yet.  
<br>
<em>&gt; - AI is not an engineering problem.  It is a product of evolution (see 2).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Engineering is a product of evolution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - We cannot predict the outcome of AI because evolution is not stable.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prone to catastrophes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
Engineering is not evolution.  But we cannot predict post-AGI in detail 
<br>
any more than an ant could predict the human mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - &quot;We&quot; (see 1) cannot observe a singularity because it is beyond our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual capacity to understand at any pre-singularity level of intellect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
In any real detail yes.  But that does not mean we have no basis for 
<br>
seeing it as desirable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - A singularity may already have happened, and the world we observe is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result.  We have no way to know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
We have no evidence this is the case and thus we must act as if it is 
<br>
not.  We can only act rationally on what we have adequate evidence is 
<br>
the case by definition.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Discussions about friendliness, risks, uploading, copying, self identity, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reprogramming the brain are SL3.  SL4 makes these issues irrelevant.
