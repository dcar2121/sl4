<em>&gt;  The most important arbitrary feature I can see, for the purpose of

</em><br>
<p>Deciding whose values will be reflected in the decision of who
<br>
benefits, may be a less intractable problem than directly deciding who
<br>
benefits.
<br>
<p>As of 2008, &quot;all currently-living adults&quot;, &quot;my tribe&quot;, &quot;a
<br>
gerrymandered group of people who happen to agree with me&quot;, and &quot;me&quot;
<br>
are all popular answers for &quot;whose values will be directly respected&quot;
<br>
type questions, personally I favor the first of the four choices as an
<br>
answer to &quot;what is the initial input to the CEV&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Otherwise it's arbitrary and there will probably be a tedious and depressing political battle over it.
</em><br>
<p>Even at the small scale, you're going to get people wandering in and
<br>
interrupting your work to try to tell you what the Final Status of
<br>
North Ireland should be. It may slightly improve things if you have a
<br>
Fair Policy laid out where you tell everyone, equally, that such
<br>
pre-Singularity lobbying is unfair to other people who aren't
<br>
currently in a position to lobby, and that they can lay out their
<br>
arguments for why Their Values are the Best through the same CEV
<br>
process as everyone else. In other words, nobody, including the
<br>
Singularity Team, should get a &quot;head start&quot;.
<br>
<p>This &quot;Fairness Problem&quot; has two components:
<br>
<p>1. What would be a Fair Policy?
<br>
<p>2. How can it be made as credible as possible, that the Fair Policy
<br>
would actually be followed?
<br>
