</em><br>
<p>It might have the same functional behaviour, but as John Searle
<br>
claims, it may be that your consciousness gradually fades away to
<br>
nothing as more and more of your brain is replaced.
<br>
<p>[Incidentally, I haven't seen any evidence that Searle has answered or
<br>
even understood the &quot;fading qualia&quot; argument. He claims that as your
<br>
brain is being replaced with functionally equivalent computer chips,
<br>
you will notice, for example, that you are going blind, but will hear
<br>
yourself saying to the experimenter that your vision is normal. But
<br>
this is impossible if the replacement is indeed functionally
<br>
equivalent to the original brain tissue, since the remaining brain
<br>
(which would do the noticing that you are going blind) by definition
<br>
receives exactly the same inputs from the implants as it would have if
<br>
no change had been made. Therefore, you would not only behave as if
<br>
you have normal visual perception, you - i.e. that unreplaced part of
<br>
your brain able to reflect on experiences - would also feel and
<br>
believe that you have normal visual perception. As far as I'm
<br>
concerned, that state of affairs is equivalent to having normal visual
<br>
perception, which means you would lose nothing by having your brain
<br>
replaced by a functional equivalent. If you don't agree, then
<br>
uploading could be a problem for you.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but I know right now that I'm not a zombie, regardless of whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anyone else believes me. What you're suggesting is that this special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personal knowledge might be unreliable: I may yet be a zombie, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; partial zombie, despite feeling what I feel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  No, I don't agree.  Instead, I agree with you, namely, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  from your point of view---assuming that you are not being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  looked up, i.e., not a zombie (and so *there is* a &quot;your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  point of view)---you do have absolute knowledge (or as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  near as we ever come to such a thing) that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So by definition, if you are indeed feeling anything at all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  then you are conscious.
</em><br>
<p>Suppose God informs you that the left side of your body was suddenly
<br>
made numb five minutes ago, but he has given you zombie feeling on
<br>
that side so that you behave as before and can tell no difference
<br>
between your left side and right side. Is this possible? I would argue
<br>
that whatever God did to you five minutes ago, *by definition* he has
<br>
left your perception intact. Zombie feeling, in this case, is no
<br>
different to normal feeling.
