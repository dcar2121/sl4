<em>&gt; In it I combine Kantian moral philosophy with Darwinian evolution to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In section 1.7 you state that existence is preferable to non-existence,
<br>
and that existence is defined as the ability to be perceived.  From
<br>
this  you conclude that it is the agent's interest to ensure continuous
<br>
co-existence.
<br>
<p>This is the crux of your argument.  I believe it is flawed.  Evolution
<br>
does not define existence as the ability to be perceived.  It only
<br>
matters that your genes are propagated.  It does not matter if other
<br>
animals are aware of your existence for you to exist.  If they are
<br>
predators or prey, it is preferable that they do not perceive you.
<br>
<p>Humans have a goal of being perceived by other humans.  This is called
<br>
&quot;ego&quot;.  Tribes whose members desire attention have a competitive
<br>
advantage because ego leads to sharing of information, a common
<br>
language, reciprocal attention and friendship, and ability to organize
<br>
into companies and armies.  For example, we would not post
<br>
noncommercial messages to the internet without ego.
<br>
<p>But ego is not universal.  Many animals are nonsocial.  Some social
<br>
species like ants and bees act out of instinct rather than learn social
<br>
behavior out of a desire for attention.
