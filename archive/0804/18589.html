<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  I guess my question would be why you value your life more than your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  copy's, if you are both identiical aside from a few neurons here and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;  &gt;  there?  They both should have roughly the same value to you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To answer your question from my personal perspective: My personal code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ethics is what I believe would be better for the world. My actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour is more complicated, parasited by actions that are better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for me personally.
</em><br>
<p>I totally understand. I tried for probably two decades to combine into
<br>
a single system what would be called &quot;what I really want&quot;. But the parts
<br>
&quot;what seems to be best for the world&quot; and &quot;what is best for Lee&quot;
<br>
stubbornly refused assimilation into a single consistent belief system.
<br>
There were just too many thought experiments that could powerfully
<br>
drive a wedge between my idealism and my selfish concerns.
<br>
<p>For example, two choices: &quot;A: save all your family and  friends
<br>
from instant death, or else B: save all the people living in Burma
<br>
from instant death.&quot;  Clearly choice B is preferable on any idealistic
<br>
basis, and indeed only *ignorance* keeps me from choosing B.
<br>
If I had a decent (shall we say &quot;familiar&quot;) knowledge of all the
<br>
lives, all the joys and sorrows, and vital experiences of the Burmese,
<br>
then I could not stand to see those millions perish for the sake of
<br>
a few dozen people I happened to know about.  But indeed,
<br>
I gave up on B, and submitted to what I truly wanted.  I wanted
<br>
to make choice A, and I would make choice A.
<br>
<p>Finally, as I say, I just gave up and admitted that there were two 
<br>
spheres of ethics that I embraced. I did try to get them to overlap
<br>
whereever possible, but still, I had to recognize their separate
<br>
existence. My seeking of consistency throughout the entire space
<br>
of possible choices---possible thought experiments---could only
<br>
be successfully carried out within each sphere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, after all these arguments, I believe that there would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be no ethical problem with destructive teleportation with instant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction. I'm also pretty convinced that teleportation with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ten second delay before destruction is fine, maybe even if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;original&quot; is conscious and aware during that time.
</em><br>
<p>The emphasis of the problem of personal identity has ALWAYS
<br>
been upon what an MSI (Most Selfish Individual) would do. It
<br>
does not help to conflate the issues of ethical behavior and
<br>
personal survival in order to understand either one.
<br>
<p>Were I an MSI, I would still unhesitatingly teleport, lose some
<br>
weeks' memories, be replaced by a frozen copy made weeks
<br>
ago, choose my own instance's death over my copies death---
<br>
any or all of these if the price were right, e.g., $10M. And I
<br>
think it would be foolish for anyone to give up the $10M
<br>
on account of unmeasurable &quot;philosophic&quot; or &quot;soul-like&quot;
<br>
differences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, if I was an MP [Member of Parliament], I would probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vote to allow most forms of destructive teleportation if the issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came up - but would be terrified of trying them out myself.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Vote to allow&quot;?  How jolly condescending of you!  I hope that
<br>
you would also &quot;vote to allow&quot; people to take their own lives
<br>
(with the proper filling out of forms, at least, so that murder or
<br>
temporary insanity could be ruled out). I also would hope that
<br>
you would vote to allow people to ingest whatever substances
<br>
they chose, provided it resulted in harm to no one else. Dear
<br>
Stuart, sorry for my abrasive and aggressive phrasing and tone,
<br>
but this is my morning personality that likes to cut through
<br>
straight to the issues :-)  give no quarter, and speak very frankly.
<br>
<p>Best personal regards as always,
<br>
Lee
