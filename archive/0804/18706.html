<p>
Samantha puts forth a basically extremely sensible list here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I was the AGI (and though more or less like I do today) and was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charged with the ultimate well-being of all sentients then my solution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be simple. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) upload all sentients into worlds identical to their current worlds or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of their choice for more evolved sentients;
</em><br>
<p>E.g., humans have a choice in the matter, but cows are too
<br>
stupid to even understand such a choice. I completely agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) by design all sentients have up to the moment back-ups;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) let them live by whatever rules (or defaults from their previous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     conditions) that they choose;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) if they off themselves or 'die' or come to serious injury they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     reinstated but likely without much memory of what came before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     but loaded up with issues to work through from before;
</em><br>
<p>If accident befalls them, then there is no reason to tamper with
<br>
their memories at all. Otherwise, rather than letting them terminate
<br>
themselves (as they're sure to do again), either talk them out of 
<br>
choosing self-destruction, or instantiate a version of him or her that
<br>
will be as close as possible to the original, but will want to keep on living.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) churn so each sentient becomes more and more enlightened / reaches 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     its highest potential at its own pace;
</em><br>
<p>Some human entities will not choose such a thing, what I
<br>
call a &quot;path of personal evolutionary progress&quot;. Take a
<br>
devout traditional religionist. There's nothing wrong with
<br>
giving him his 1mm^3 of the material resources he requires,
<br>
and the 1 second per real second of runtime [1] he requires,
<br>
to live as he wishes indefinitely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6) interfere only as judiciously and minimally as possible to avoid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     forcing the outcome to something other than what the sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     would ultimately choose.
</em><br>
<p>Right. Which is why I amended your #5.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In short a full VR multiverse with perfect reincarnation overseen by a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully benevolent God/Mind.     Otherwise I think universal or perfect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness is a rather nasty farce.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't call it a farce, exactly, but I know what you're getting
<br>
at and I agree completely. Silicon/diamondoid on Earth alone will
<br>
provide ample and relatively incredibly small resources per
<br>
individual human (as they're now constituted), and it would be
<br>
greedy and unappreciative of the FAI to do anything less for humans.
<br>
<p>Now the question of how much resources should more advanced and
<br>
ambitious humans receive is a vastly harder question. Perhaps as much
<br>
as an entire cubic meter, at 1sec/sec of processing. But we can leave
<br>
that, conveniently, to the FAI.
<br>

<br>
<p>[1] One second of subjective time per second of objective time.
