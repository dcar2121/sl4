<p>
To recapitulate:  to avoid &quot;the end of time&quot; or to avoid belief
<br>
in &quot;platonia&quot; or having to dismiss (according to my calculations)
<br>
mundane moral concerns about other people's suffering and so
<br>
on, many years ago I abandoned strict functionalism because
<br>
that recourse seemed to be the only &quot;out&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I then claimed that although it looked like ordinary computation
<br>
(including conscious instances) from the outside, a Giant Lookup
<br>
Table (GLUT) would in fact not be conscious. The S-GLUT here
<br>
(for Simple GLUT) is assumed to take any state that it's currently
<br>
in and merely use that as an address of its next state. Example:
<br>
take a particular generation on Conway's Life Board (of a trillion
<br>
by trillion pixels) and instead of computing the next generation
<br>
by local rules (Rules of Life) use the whole 10^24 bits to look
<br>
up the next state.
<br>
<p>But I was concerned that the noose of my argument wasn't
<br>
quite drawn tight enough; therefore, I made a slightly more
<br>
complex GLUT (this time with no &quot;S-&quot;) that first took the
<br>
present state, used a perfect hash on it to produce (in Stuart
<br>
Armstrong's notation) f(s) where s is a state and f(s) is the
<br>
hash of that state (or bit string).  Then *that* element would
<br>
be used as an address into the GLUT that would yield the
<br>
next state (e.g. the next generation). 
<br>
<p>It *was* probably a good idea to use f, because if you took
<br>
just a state of the Life Board (or of a human brain) and
<br>
simply encoded it by a raster scan or something into what
<br>
will be used as an address (for table lookup), then the
<br>
&quot;connection&quot; between two states is still relatively simple:
<br>
No, not quite as simple as Conway's Rules (or, for a human
<br>
brain, the laws of physics), but still, a fairly trivial algorithm
<br>
could unpack the string  and then do local (simple) (and
<br>
perhaps *genuine*) computations on it to arrive at the
<br>
next state. (As Stuart would say, the KC of just going from
<br>
one state in the S-GLUT to the next would be low.)
<br>
<p>By introducing the hash function f, I made sure that this 
<br>
mapping would *not* be simple. An algorithm given f(s)
<br>
would have to (in order to *calculate* the next state)
<br>
first compute f^(-1)  of f(s) and go from there. Thus my
<br>
GLUT, as it ended up, has this structure:  at address
<br>
f(s) is the next state s'.
<br>
<p>So, for example, a computronium machine that already had
<br>
this GLUT could hold a conversation with you as follows.
<br>
It's in state s1, and when you utter a syllable to it, it goes
<br>
into s2, which is (fundamentally) a function of s1 and your
<br>
input.  Now, so far, that's how all of us are, and how any
<br>
machine is.  But next, instead of &quot;thinking&quot; about your
<br>
syllable, I claim that as a very unauthentic form of computation
<br>
it merely does this:  it adds your syllable to its present state
<br>
performs a complex (but perfect) hash on the result when 
<br>
interpreted as a bit string, and using that hash as an address,
<br>
looks up its next state, which presumably includes a bit of
<br>
structure that is a little of the first formulation of something
<br>
it might be going to say back to you (for example).
<br>
<p>And I argued at length, and still do, that surely this is not
<br>
conscious activity.
<br>
<p>Stuart then created a couple of nice mathematical models
<br>
of this, about which it appears that exact results can be
<br>
proven, instead of relying on intuition as I had been doing.
<br>
I like his models very much.
<br>
<p>He says this, taken verbatim from his earlier posts in
<br>
&quot;The GLUT and Functionalism&quot;:  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        S = a finite set of polynomials.
</em><br>
<p>This is the analog of the state of someone's brain or
<br>
a generation in Conway's Life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        G = a GLUT on S.
</em><br>
<p>G takes a generation, state, (or actually, the hash of a generation
<br>
or state) and outputs &quot;the next&quot; state. I made it use *addresses*
<br>
in particular, but Stuart is abstracting away from that to explain
<br>
that G is actually a function. I don't think that the domain of the
<br>
function is S, however. The domain of the function G is the GLUT
<br>
itself; G takes entries of the GLUT to other entries.  I hope that
<br>
all this explication is to Stuart's satisfaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        R = a rule that says that any polynomial of n-th degree will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;               mapped, under G, to a polynomial of (n-1)-th degree.
</em><br>
<p>This is analogous to the rule in Conway's Life that would take a
<br>
generation to the next generation, or the laws of physics that would
<br>
take a human brain (or the present state of a conscious program)
<br>
to its next state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         f = a hash function from S (to f(S))
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;         f(G) = the GLUT on f(S) equivalent to G on S.
</em><br>
<p>Entries in this new GLUT-2 take elements GLUT-2 to other
<br>
elements of GLUT-2, which I now think is at odds with my
<br>
original conception, namely that in my GLUT, one could
<br>
visualize an address and the contents at that address, 
<br>
respectively f(s) and s'.  (So in my GLUT, the entries were
<br>
ordinary states, it's just that they were looked up by a very
<br>
peculiar process (the hash).) Perhaps it's really equivalent
<br>
to what Stuart as saying---but even if not, his model strikes
<br>
me, again, as very interesting and applicable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;          f(R) = the rule on f(S) equivalent to R on S.
</em><br>
<p>While the rule R that takes, for example, s to s', is fairly simple
<br>
(e.g. the Rules of Life), this new rule f(R) seems to take hashes
<br>
to other hashes, though I may be confused.
<br>
<p>Anyway, Stuart now writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hum, my understanding of a GLUT was that you fed it the state of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, and it would give you the next one. Thus a GLUT is a function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the states of a system; you feed it one state and it gives you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that was without the use of the hash function. But now I see
<br>
where I wasn't understanding:  any GLUT could be taken as a
<br>
function that took states of the GLUT to other states of it. Thanks
<br>
for explaining.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So S is my set of states (taken to be polynomials, for this example),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and G is a GLUT on S - a function from S to itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (note: I don't actually want G to be full GLUT, but actually a simpler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule, like differentiation; but we'll have to start with G being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GLUT).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; G is therefore a collection of ordered pairs of elements of S (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pairs are (initial state , resulting state). The KC of such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection is well defined.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and pretty simple, too. You can locally examine (of course)
<br>
patches of a Life Board to get to the next generation, and still
<br>
rather trivially examine a simple raster scan or bit string (made
<br>
by taking the 10^12 x 10^12 Life Board and reading it out
<br>
one row at a time), and legitimately compute the next state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now R is a rule, i.e. a restriction that the function G must obey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is given by an ordered collection of sets (P(n) = the &quot;n-th degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polynomials&quot;), and the rule that G must map P(n) to P(n-1)).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now the maximal KC that G can have, given this rule, is huge.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not really sure of that, or if it's profitable to speak that
<br>
way. G takes states of *this* GLUT to other states, and since
<br>
we haven't hashed anything yet, why emphasize that its KC
<br>
could be huge?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Formulating the rule R itself is of trivial KC; [yes] the process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of taking a polynomial and sending it to its degree is also of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trivial KC. In fact I have just, completely defined it in a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences, no matter what the cardinality of S is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now we have a hash function f, mapping bijectively to the set f(S). By
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the composition f G f^{-1} , we have a function (a GLUT) mapping f(S)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to itself. I called it f(G).
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We also have the &quot;rule&quot; f(R). This is given by the requirement that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; f(G) must map f(P(n)) to f(P(n-1)). That statement is of trivial KC.
</em><br>
<p>What?  How could that be? I would think that the connection
<br>
between f(P(n)) and f(P(n-1)) would be enormously more
<br>
complicated. (It's why I introduced the hash function f in the
<br>
first place.)  Looks like we may have a slightly different idea
<br>
of what we're talking about.
<br>
<p>Oh!  Perhaps you simply mean that the literal table-lookup
<br>
connection between f(P(n)) to f(P(n-1)) is by definition
<br>
trivial, since it's just an assignment?  (Sort of like the way
<br>
that the relation between an address and the contents at
<br>
that address is absurdly simple in my scheme.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But given an element p of f(S), knowing whether it is in f(P(n))
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is of very high KC: to do so,
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, it would be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we need to calculate f^{-1}(p), and the KC of f is maximal.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus the rule f(R) is of high KC, as it requires a lot of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With me so far?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe!  What does it look like to you?  Is it safe to proceed?  :-)
