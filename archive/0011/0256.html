<p>
Life on an email list is, sadly, not like life in a hunter-gatherer
<br>
tribe.  In a hunter-gatherer tribe, if someone moves onto a topic in which
<br>
the tribe-at-large is not interested, there is feedback.  People roll
<br>
their eyes, start sub-conversations under their breath, begin playing with
<br>
a yo-yo - dissatisfaction is visible, not just to other people, but to the
<br>
speaker.
<br>
<p>Present mailing-list technology has no such feedback mechanism. 
<br>
(&quot;Feedback mechanism&quot;... not &quot;pain&quot;... oh, never mind... &lt;smile&gt;.)  People
<br>
would probably be willing to change the subject if they could see the
<br>
audience yawning, but they can't - it takes an actual post to convey any
<br>
information, which, on the scale of social actions, is nearly akin to
<br>
clearing your throat or interrupting the speaker.   It's rude, and most of
<br>
us are reluctant to be rude.
<br>
<p>Because of this lack of feedback - or rather, the much higher threshold
<br>
before feedback is initiated - we now have the institution of the
<br>
moderated mailing list.  Some moderators actually try to approve or
<br>
disapprove each post, and I'll move to a system like that if this one
<br>
doesn't work; but first I'd like to try a system in which the moderator
<br>
(me) acts as the list's stabilizing mechanism.
<br>
<p>It's very tempting to just tolerate posts that are slightly less than
<br>
perfect.  So I do.  I draw the line at &quot;significantly less than perfect&quot;,
<br>
though.  I have been on other mailing lists that illustrate the terrible
<br>
danger of this slippery slide; first it's less than perfect, then it's
<br>
nowhere near perfect, and soon it's not perfect at all.  I am committed to
<br>
maintaining high-quality postage - measured by intelligence, originality,
<br>
usefulness, future shock, creativity, humor, importance - on the SL4
<br>
mailing list.  There shall be no bulk filler.
<br>
<p>I have confidence in my ability to distinguish between &quot;posts that
<br>
disagree with me&quot; and &quot;posts that are not interesting&quot;.  If my
<br>
self-confidence is misplaced, then SL4 shall no doubt become an
<br>
intellectual wasteland and there will be a mass exodus.  Until then,
<br>
though, please remember that this is a private forum and that there is
<br>
nothing immoral or unethical about my attempting to moderate the content;
<br>
that service, though provided for free, is the reason why others
<br>
subscribed to this list.
<br>
<p>In the process, it is possible that some of my own personal prejudices may
<br>
wind up being reflected in my buzzer choices, though I expect not.  If any
<br>
of you disagree with a *BZzzt* - especially on the grounds that you
<br>
*personally* wanted to see that thread continued - please email me
<br>
privately with your negative feedback.
