<p>
Just a few quick unreferenced thoughts on Ben's article.
<br>
<p>Besides what others have mentioned, libertartianism is based upon personal
<br>
responsibility, without imposing anything on others.  Coercion is the
<br>
ultimate no-no, and even beyond physical force, forcing one's will is
<br>
equally contemptable.  The result of this is that if I assume full
<br>
responsibility for my own actions and choose not to coerce, I cannot be a
<br>
burden to anybody.
<br>
<p>If I walk down a street in a slum neighborhood, perhaps I'll toss a bum a
<br>
buck or two.  This is my choice, but I wouldn't expect others to toss this
<br>
bum an equivalent amount.  The bum has his own reasons for being a bum, and
<br>
I have my reasons for being who I am.  We have both made choices for which
<br>
we are ultimately responsible, and while I can't speak for the bum, I
<br>
personally have no regrets, because I acknowldge that every thought and
<br>
action I have carried out has been prompted by a conscious (and hopefully
<br>
always rational) impulse.
<br>
<p>So why should a government force me to pay this bum against my will?  With
<br>
the government out of the equation, the bum and I are two separate entities
<br>
who may or may not have a significant interaction...a mutually acceptable
<br>
position; but with the government involved, I am indirectly forced to put
<br>
my money into the bum's palm through taxation etc.  Now why in the world
<br>
should two separate people who have carved their own paths be forced to
<br>
interact?  I truly owe the bum nothing, and I don't expect him to owe me
<br>
anything either.
<br>
<p>In regards to Ben's claim about the libertarian feel to some Extropian
<br>
texts, I will admit that many have presumed the same thing.  Would I were
<br>
an American, I would *personally* have voted for Browne, but there is no
<br>
actual political affiliation between Extropianism and libertarianism.  In
<br>
the Self Direction and Open Society principles, there are some general
<br>
statements about how authoritarian regimes are not beneficial to progress,
<br>
but this is based on fact.  Otherwise, politics are pretty much peripheral
<br>
to what Extropianism is all about.  Leave the specifics up to individuals.
