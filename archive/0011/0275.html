<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	okay, let me get this straight. if by enlightenment we mean (very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly) understanding of self and by intelligence we mean (again, very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly) understanding of reality apart from self, then this seems to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense. since one can not observe all parts of oneself all the time (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed and the observer must be separate), one may always be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve greater self-understanding by devoting more computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to observing oneself (though intuitively there's probably a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; margin of diminishing returns looming over the horizon). in other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's always an &quot;unseen self&quot; that can not be eliminated; furthermore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this unseen self could potentially be a black hole into which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual devotes more and more computational resources, attempting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observe verself more completely.
</em><br>
<p>This is a reasonable way of putting it, sure...
<br>
<p>The hypothesis of Zen and some other &quot;wisdom traditions&quot; is that we
<br>
typically
<br>
don't spend nearly enough time/space &quot;remembering ourselves&quot; -- not
<br>
analyzing
<br>
ourselves, but simply being acutely aware of the things we're doing ....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 	but this sounds like another way of saying that omniscience is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible ... which, on this list, is surely not in dispute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Omniscience is impossible given our current assumptions about the physical
<br>
universe
<br>
(e.g. speed of light is the maximum speed...).
<br>
<p>&quot;Impossible&quot; is a stronger term than I like to use, because given my own
<br>
finite information
<br>
base, it's not possible for me to draw conclusions with probability 1 ...
<br>
<p>I.e., the assumptions about the physical universe aren't 100% certain
<br>
<p>The interesting point this leads up to, then, is: OK, so omniscience is
<br>
impossible, but a system
<br>
with a LOT MORE resources is going to be able to have a LOT MORE
<br>
self-awareness/mindfulness than
<br>
we have, together with a LOT MORE external-problem-focused intelligence...
<br>
<p>It will still be subject to the limitations I've described -- BUT, there can
<br>
be little doubt that it's
<br>
&quot;internal landscape,&quot; its assortment of states of consciousness, will be
<br>
rather different than ours...
<br>
<p>We have a few states of consciousness that we're in most of the time:
<br>
ordinary waking consciousness,
<br>
dreaming, hypnagogic/hypnopompic states ... then there are various drug
<br>
states, fugues, etc.  Presumably
<br>
a machine with an order of magnitude greater processing power will get into
<br>
yet other states of consciousness...
<br>
<p>Anyone have any concrete intuitions about what they might be?
<br>
<p>To me this ties directly into the notion of Friendly AI.  I think there are
<br>
states of consciousness where compassion
<br>
and ethics mean NOTHING... or almost nothing....  I can think of a couple
<br>
<p>1) rage (definitely an altered state of awareness) ... the state people get
<br>
in when they kill other people out of anger.
<br>
Anyone who's been in a serious physical fight has probably felt the fringes
<br>
of this state coming on... unfortunately,
<br>
I think I have...
<br>
<p>2) nihilistic indifference ... like Kirilov in &quot;The Possessed&quot; (also called
<br>
&quot;The Devils&quot;) by Dostoevsky ... this guy
<br>
didn't kill anyone in the novel, but he might as well have -- he just didn't
<br>
believe the world existed, so he just
<br>
didn't care whether any other person happened to be alive or not...
<br>
<p>Now, I'd hypothesize that an AI in the future, with a different inner
<br>
landscape of consciousness-states, may well
<br>
have a whole new assemblage of BAD (unFriendly) states of consciousness, as
<br>
well as a whole new assemblage of
<br>
good ones....  Unless we can anticipate these, how can we design in advance
<br>
a system that will lead to a
<br>
post-Singularity friendly AI system?
<br>
