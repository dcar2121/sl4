</em><br>
<p>Oh, go ahead - that statement was a bit too sweeping.  No, that's not
<br>
enough.  That statement was factually incorrect.
<br>
<p>In some areas, mathematics may turn out to be applicable, when particular
<br>
systems have underlying behaviors that turn out to give rise to
<br>
mathematical dynamics.  This would be especially expected of systems in
<br>
which some quantity is conserved, or in which there is an analogue to
<br>
potential energys surfaces, or where you can use statistical mathematics
<br>
to describe systems containing a stochastic element, and so on.  I do
<br>
think that such mathematics will tend to be far more crude than the math
<br>
used by physicists.  And I think that the math will get less refined, not
<br>
more refined, as we start describing the mind rather than the brain.
<br>
<p>But *this* vision:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, where differ is then in our intuition about the relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics and cognitive science.  I think that a new kind of math is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to transform cognitive science into a real science.  Perhaps AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will help us create this new kind of math.
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly and precisely the vision that I disagree with.-
<br>
<p>Cognitive science will not become a real science as the result of math. 
<br>
It will not advance as a result of advances in mathematics.  As we
<br>
understand the mind better, cognitive science will approach computer
<br>
programming.  And the best computer programmers are not computer
<br>
scientists; they are hackers.  Now, any hacker gets a bonus to their
<br>
intuitive understanding by understanding complexity theory and computer
<br>
science and potential energy surfaces and, in fact, everything under the
<br>
Sun - but actual computer programming uses very little mathematics. 
<br>
Sometimes a hacker winds up in a mathematical situation, yes;
<br>
cryptographers do, and sometimes the parallel processing people need to
<br>
resort to &quot;something more complicated than simple arithmetic&quot; to
<br>
understand the behavior of resource wait times and so on.  But these are
<br>
the exceptions, not the rule.  As we understand the mind even better, the
<br>
*kind* of similarity to computer programming will approach similarity to
<br>
hacking, rather than similarity to computer science.  Results from
<br>
complexity theory or chaos theory will become *less* useful as time goes
<br>
on and the mathematically describable regularities are optimized out of
<br>
the system.  And the ultimate core of intelligence, the ability to make
<br>
smart decisions, will never get reduced to an equation, because smartness
<br>
is at the top of the reductholistic heap, not at the bottom.
<br>
<p>In computer programming we build upwards, and mathematics is useful for
<br>
digging downwards.  The farther upwards we build, the farther we get from
<br>
mathematics.  Sometimes the low-level behavior of our own systems starts
<br>
to contain an element we didn't plan on, and we then have to debug it
<br>
using mathematics - thread resource conflicts, for example.  But the
<br>
*frontier*, the cutting edge, the place where we're building one step
<br>
higher and inventing something new, will never involve somebody solving an
<br>
equation to find out what to invent, because equations can't tell us
<br>
that.  The interesting, high-level parts of the mind will resemble the
<br>
piece of code you're playing with and that you didn't need any mathematics
<br>
to write, rather than the one time in a month that you needed an actual
<br>
equation to describe memory pool allocation conflicts as a function of the
<br>
percentage of utilization - while being infinitely more complex than both,
<br>
of course; the point I'm trying to make is that some causal systems just
<br>
don't have useful mathematical descriptions.  And if you try to describe
<br>
one of those systems using mathematics, then that is not making it more
<br>
like &quot;real science&quot;, but less.
