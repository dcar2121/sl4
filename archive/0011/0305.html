<em>&gt; Who knows, Davies may turn out to be right; but even so, this strikes me

</em><br>
<p>I think Physicists of our time are generally are much less willing to
<br>
dismiss things out of hand (alarming notion!=physical impossibility).
<br>
However, I must take issue with the analogies you make here, especially as
<br>
you are either glossing over, or overlooking things which make these
<br>
different kinds of &quot;barriers&quot;, rather than different magnitudes. The sound
<br>
barrier/heavier than air arguement is oft quoted w.r.t. travel at speeds
<br>
greater than c (tantamount to time travel, which I'll come to). No
<br>
physical theory said faster than sound flight was *physically* impossible.
<br>
There is a theory which says faster than light travel is physically
<br>
impossible though (Relativity, both general and special). Though there are
<br>
some (theoretical, not observed) metrics which appear to violate this
<br>
locally, globally flat space time is a pretty good approximation. Flat
<br>
space time is special relativity(SR), and whatever way you write it, and
<br>
however you do it, globally SR has never been violated and there is no
<br>
theoretical way to violate it either - QM obeys it, even including EPR
<br>
paradoxes and mesoscopic systems.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So - in contrast to the vague reasons given for the limits to
<br>
human technology as regards supersonic flight, reliable(*) physical theory
<br>
has given us concrete physical limits to our universe, as we understand it
<br>
now. There is no loophole without an effect that has yet to be discovered.
<br>
Let me say that again another way: though we may construct theories that
<br>
don't disallow certain things (eg: time travel) these theories do not
<br>
belong to the minimal consistent set of physical theories. 
<br>
<p>&lt; (*) aside: how reliable is SR? How many tests of SR do we do each day
<br>
that CERN / SLAC / FermiLab run? Millions? How many times has SR been
<br>
wrong? Never. Would we see it if it was wrong just once? Oh yes!&gt;
<br>
<p>Time travel: We need accept only one of: universal flat space time, upper
<br>
speed limit for information transfer=c, or causality, to run into immense
<br>
difficulties constructing a theory which allows time travel. In fact, with
<br>
out accepting causality we run into immense problems constructing any
<br>
logical theory. You are confusing technology and science - technology
<br>
enables us to do things which are physically possible, but new technology
<br>
has never directly shown new physics - only (human) ingenuity at applying
<br>
current technologies has (so far) done that. I accept that beyond our
<br>
singularity we will be effectively reversing this situation (that's the
<br>
whole point!) but you should not construct a logical discussion on points
<br>
outside current theories unless you derive a concrete result.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; theories permitted the possibility of time travel / negative energy /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naked singularities etc., twentieth-century physicists still refused to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe, calling them 'alarming notions'.&quot;  This rant is more about time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel then about thermodynamics, but real physical laws don't look like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're about to be violated every second Tuesday.  Sometimes physics
</em><br>
<p>Thermodynamics is something you should be concerned with. Locally, at
<br>
scales &lt;10^-10 m (say) physics is CPT invariant, yet the emergent
<br>
properties of matter are anything but (as you have stated). If you hold
<br>
that intelligence is an emergent property of correctly /near optimally
<br>
arranged matter, than one would have thought we're going to need to be
<br>
able to understand the transistion phase from quantum to statistical
<br>
mechanics as the best modelled physical analogue we have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;permissible fluctuations in entropy&quot;, but did you ever hear of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permissible fluctuation in mass-energy?
</em><br>
<p>Vacuum pair creation, on short time scales.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If current physical theory offends a physicist, so what?  God does play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dice with the Universe, Einstein, get over it.  Even the more imaginative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicists, like David Deutsch, suffer from the same disease, confining
</em><br>
<p>Physicists must work in science fact, not fiction. For example, we have
<br>
several candidates for a GUT. Which one do we choose? We can choose our
<br>
favorite, we can choose the one that says every particle is really an n-th
<br>
dimensional donut because it lets us do something we'd really like to do
<br>
(eat donuts), but all that means nothing if we don't have physical
<br>
evidence for the theory. We had a theory that predicted the Tau lepton
<br>
but we waited until it was observed before we attached that theory to
<br>
&quot;reality&quot;. Imagination is essential for physics, and there are a lot of
<br>
imaginative theories out there. Keep your head in the clouds but your feet
<br>
on the ground - until there is evidence for an effect (causality
<br>
violation, time travel, whatever) assume it may be possible, but don't
<br>
skew your objective judgement of theory and fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; closed timelike curves to quantum universes and so on.  Time travel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *including* global causality violation, is explicitly permitted by General
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Relativity.
</em><br>
<p>No, it isn't. GR must obey SR over large enough distances (and SR is
<br>
prerequisite for GR). The Universe obeys SR (flat space time metric). In
<br>
SR you can not violate causality, full stop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Physicists will just need to learn to deal with it.
</em><br>
<p>Er, no. The Universe is the Universe, and that's what we deal with. You've
<br>
taken a model of the universe (GR), together with one small group of
<br>
possible interpretations of the model (some fancy metric which requires
<br>
negative mass, gravitational potentials larger than those at an event
<br>
horizon, or some other such - admittedly theoretically interesting
<br>
-nonsense) and remapped that interpretation back on to the Universe,
<br>
ignoring the fact that the original interpretation relied on something
<br>
unphysical in the first place. Sorry, but that is faulty reasoning. If you
<br>
did understand GR completely (which you don't), you still would have no
<br>
right to say &quot;Ah, but we can do this in our model (if we push all our
<br>
paremeters to one corner of the phase space) therefore we can do this in
<br>
reality&quot;. In addition, you are attempting to use a technology
<br>
(mathematical constructs around GR) to fault the apparent narrow
<br>
mindedness of physicists who use and develop that technology as their own
<br>
tool. To do that, you better be on a very firm foundation - and it's clear
<br>
you're not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, never mind.  I'm not a physicist.  You can get personally annoyed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical theories, but you're supposed to buy the right to do so with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics doctorate.  This system works so well generally that I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no real objection to being slapped down by it personally.  Not my job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;/RANT&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I like this though ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is an interesting way of looking at it.  It looks to me like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles being created and destroyed - in particular, negative-energy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive-energy particles annihilating, as opposed to matter-antimatter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions which give rise to gamma rays or other new particles - are
</em><br>
<p>I think you're talking about the same process here: negative energy states
<br>
are one way of looking at anti-matter states, at least in basic
<br>
formulations of Quantum Field Theories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Universe, where a negative and positive particle pair will come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence; thus the current phase-space point of the Universe can give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise to multiple points at the next instant - one possible alternate point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for each place a virtual particle pair can pop up.  Similarly, a virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pair (&quot;virtual pair&quot; in the negative-positive, not matter-antimatter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense) can annihilate either over *here* or over *there*, and the state of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Universe will be same either way, since neither particle exists any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more - a many-to-one interaction.  It's an interesting question whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this same objection applies to Feynman diagrams; that is, whether a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positron and electron can collide in two different ways and give rise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely the same gamma particle.  I myself don't know.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not quite sure what physics you're trying to describe here; Feynman
<br>
diagrams describe point-like interactions; there is only one diagram for
<br>
e+ e- annihilation to a photon (one vertex, three legs). Remember Feynman
<br>
diagrams are only tools to represent rather complex integrations - the
<br>
physics is the physics we get from the Universe, the math is the modelling
<br>
(QM, perturbation theory, Hamiltonian, integration), the Feynmen diagram
<br>
is the mnemonic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (As Hal Finney from &quot;Extropians&quot; put it:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There is a 'quantum thermodynamics', it's called statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mechanics, and entropy still increases there. There's interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recent work in quantum information theory which suggests that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entropy and entanglement are related, and maybe there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distinctively quantum ways to *locally* decrease entropy ... but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there's no inkling of a global violation of the second law.
</em><br>
<p>What is the link between simple symmetry, which allow us to write down
<br>
elegantly the Lagrangian for the Standard Model of Particle Physics, and
<br>
Statistical mechanics? Where do &quot;simple&quot; CPT invariance and symmetry,
<br>
and deterministic particle interactions become the stocastic chaos of
<br>
statistical mechanics? At what point is T (Time reflection, interchange
<br>
of forward and backward lightcones) no longer a symmetry of a physical
<br>
system because of statistics? (Actually, T is violated for weak nuclear
<br>
interactions at the quantum level as well...). Once we know the answers to
<br>
these questions we can start playing around with the bridge between the
<br>
QM world and the &quot;real&quot; macroscopic one. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is, of course, that the many-worlds model just isn't true.  If
</em><br>
<p>You can't just say that, since there are no observational consequences of
<br>
the many worlds model. You are ruling something out in almost the same way
<br>
as I'd rule out the class of GR metrics that allow time travel, except one
<br>
senario has testable experimental consequences, the other doesn't ;-)
<br>
Interpretation of QM is philosophy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; quantum collapse were an observational-effect illusion, it would make no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference what the probability amplitudes were; we would have the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed chance of winding up in a .2 probability Universe as a .8
</em><br>
<p>No, the probabilities would still be different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; crystal in which quantum effects turned heat directly into electricity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although it might not be direct current, or at least not direct current of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a predictable direction, as that would violate CPT.
</em><br>
<p>Point of note: if you're going to allow time travel, you can violate CPT
<br>
at the quantum level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But your objection is probably correct; e.g., performing a discrimination,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or continually checking for one, on an entire physical system, could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily turn out to have entropy costs far in excess of entropy gained.
</em><br>
<p>This is calculable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A more interesting idea is this:  Perform the Maxwell's Demon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discrimination, extract the information, send the information backwards in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, and then don't perform the costly process that got you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information in the first place.  This throws away entropy into a future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gets wiped out of existence by tampering with the past.
</em><br>
<p>This is where you need to remember that the theories you're using are a
<br>
consequence of causality in the first place. Entropy is a consequence of
<br>
the arrow of time. If it were easy for the Universe to dump things in
<br>
futures that don't happen then that is what would happen, and we wouldn't
<br>
be talking about entropy.
<br>
<p>Hmmm.. I've gone on rather longer than I'd hoped, but the points I've
<br>
attempted to make are these:
<br>
If one is going to use physical theories for some thing concrete
<br>
(ie: predictive) then use the theory correctly - don't use a theory for an
<br>
analogy, use it to calculate, that is what it is there for. Entropy is a 
<br>
precisely defined quantity for example (but be aware of the tacit
<br>
assumptions made in defining a quantity).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one is going to speculate about science fiction (a possible
<br>
effect which hasn't been observed yet, that would have &quot;scientific&quot;
<br>
reprecussions) then speculate, but don't do it within the framework of the
<br>
general consensus, since those theories were formulated to explain only
<br>
observed effects. Certainly one shouldn't use the fact that an
<br>
interpretation of an individual theory allows something to conclude that
<br>
that something exists... minimise your assumptions.
<br>
