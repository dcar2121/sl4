Hi
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not really, my intuition is to sandbox AIs tightly (especially the smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones) until we can be sure they aren't going to go do something stupid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which is highly likely to begin with) in the real world.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, &quot;sandboxing&quot; of AI is not a viable commercial strategy
<br>
<p>Right now, we have a very stupid, sandboxed &quot;Baby Webmind&quot; which is only in
<br>
the
<br>
testing/debugging/algorithms-tweaking phase; and, some less flexible,
<br>
adaptive WM
<br>
systems that are doing real things in the world (predicting markets,
<br>
categorizing texts)
<br>
<p>There is a lot of pressure, naturally, to get the more adaptive, intelligent
<br>
WM
<br>
system involved in real-world revenue-generating activities as well
<br>
<p>Hence my prediction that as soon as an AI system works reasonably well, it
<br>
will NOT
<br>
be sandboxed, but will rather be aggressively commercialized (whether by me
<br>
or someone
<br>
else)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get very nervous when I hear about AI improving itself. It's like doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain surgery on yourself. What if you damage an area that affects your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement &amp; you start making random modifications? Instabilities are most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to result, to say the least.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could have some nice trustworthy AI's perception suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some unforeseen modification, and because the AI is modifying itself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's new perception will further affect it's modifications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I prefer an architecture without that kind of internal feedback.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;But if self-modification causes greater intelligence, then, the
<br>
self-modifying systems
<br>
are going to be the ones, ultimately, more thoroughly commercialized, and
<br>
hence having more
<br>
of a real-world effect
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm well aware that thinking is itself a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-modification, but on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different level. We can't modify major parts of our neural architecture by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually this stability problem is a large part of the AI problem itself.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but in evolving a population of AI's it's OK if some small percentage
<br>
is
<br>
&quot;nuts.&quot;  If this isn't true, chances are the evolutionary process is being
<br>
too conservative
<br>
and evolution will be slow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not a big fan of evolutionary methods.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are you a big fan of proposing viable alternatives in detail?
<br>
<p>I'm open to suggestions, but general and vague suggestions are not useful.
<br>
<p>Evolutionary methods are slow, so I wouldn't mind replacing them with
<br>
something else,
<br>
but as global optimization methods go, they are in  my experience
<br>
incomparably robust at
<br>
getting you to a &quot;reasonably good&quot; solution (though not the best at getting
<br>
a precise solution
<br>
in contexts where that is required)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; yeah, but an aircraft is not a mind, or a body.  Minds are intrinsically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complex, self-organizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and hard to predict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again you underline my concern.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  All intelligences are unpredictable, hence dangerous.  It occurs to
<br>
me every
<br>
time I drive down the highway.  One human brain could go psyche, swerve the
<br>
car it's
<br>
driving and kill me...
<br>
<p>I just don't think this is a solvable problem
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If minds could be built like airplanes, then rule-based AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; further along than it is!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Urgh! Are you equating intelligent design with rule-based AI? - If so, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't subscribe to that point of view. Rule-based 'AI' doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even qualify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as AI in my view! :P
</em><br>
<p>Rule-based AI is the primary existing AI paradigm that attempts to build a
<br>
mind in
<br>
which the overall behavior of the whole can easily be predicted from the
<br>
behavior
<br>
of the parts -- and this kinds of prediction seems to me to be prerequisite
<br>
for the
<br>
non-evolutionary approach to AI improvement that you're (or I thought you
<br>
were, when I
<br>
typed that reply) suggesting...
<br>
<p>Of course, we all try to design our AI systems intelligently, but, even so,
<br>
one requires
<br>
an evolutionary (or other automatic optimization) approach to determining
<br>
the finer details
<br>
of system structure (the alternative would be a detailed mathematical,
<br>
quantitative theory
<br>
of complex systems, which is nowhere nearby...)
<br>
<p>In other words, we can use intelligent design to create a system that is in
<br>
principle capable
<br>
of intelligent behavior.  But to actually make it work, a lot of evolution,
<br>
or something like it,
<br>
is required to tune the numerous parameters of the system.  Parameter tuning
<br>
is the difference
<br>
between sanity and psychosis, in AI's as well as humans (drugs basically
<br>
&quot;parameter tune or mis-tune&quot;
<br>
the brain)
