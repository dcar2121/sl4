<em>&gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I admit that we're all way out of our depth in speculating about what's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to happen after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity... maybe my reasoning based on biological life is wrong, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's the best guide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have... my intuition is that it's a better guide than the kind of Utopian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments you're presenting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but hey, what's my intuition or yours worth here, we're both just bags of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meat 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think that our model of the future should deprecate shaping forces
<br>
which are clearly and specifically modeled on aspects of biological life which
<br>
are strict properties of our own evolution, and for which no equivalent shaper
<br>
exists in the futuristic scenario.
<br>
<p>In less formal language:  &quot;That's like saying future supercomputers will be
<br>
built from human neurons and that starships will have two arms and two legs.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's quite possible that the Citizens will be capable of trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resources back and forth, but hopefully some &quot;minimal living space&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; requirement will be enforced... possibly as a restriction upon the trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; activities of the Citizens who exist, but certainly before a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Child Citizen is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; created.  (The ethical rationale for placing this restriction on trading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; activities would be that it represents an irrevocable harm to any future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; versions of the Citizen's self, which may have changed their minds, or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even be changed so much as to be different entities.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, what you're suggesting here is basically a democratic socialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe ... which seems to me quite anti-libertarian.  Isn't it restricting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone's freedom to tell them they can't bet all their computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a horse race?  Isn't this immoral, according to the strict libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creed?
</em><br>
<p>I live libertarianism, rather than looking it up in a table of rules, so I'm
<br>
not sure what you mean by &quot;strict&quot;.  Heh heh.  (I'm currently in the midst of
<br>
a totally unrelated offline debate about &quot;strictness&quot;.  Never mind.)
<br>
<p>My libertarian intuitions tell me that your future self is not the same as
<br>
your past self, especially if tools exist that could enable you to completely
<br>
rewrite your own motivations and memories.  My intuitions tell me that the
<br>
Sysop should not obey an instruction &quot;Terminate me one subjective year from
<br>
now, regardless of any objections I may make at that time&quot;, nor should the
<br>
Sysop enforce a contract which contains such a provision.  You can commit your
<br>
current self to anything, even instruct the Sysop to switch you off, but to
<br>
irrevocably commit your future self constitutes coercion of that future self
<br>
and violation of that future self's rights.  If building a Child that runs on
<br>
a memory partition below Minimal Living Space constitutes child abuse, then
<br>
committing all versions of your future self to running below MLS constitutes a
<br>
possible infliction of nonconsensual hurt on that future self.
<br>
<p>Bear in mind that, for a human right after the Singularity - one of us fleshly
<br>
refugees - we're talking about something like 0.00[...]01% of total wealth,
<br>
and if you want to give EVERYTHING away, you can commit suicide to do so.
<br>
<p>I confess that some of my response may have to do with an intuitive dread that
<br>
otherwise some idiot will reproduce a billion times over, and then a second
<br>
generation, until we've got minds squeezed onto 50K of RAM and another zillion
<br>
wretched poor and the same damn problem with charity and &quot;bad incentives&quot; and
<br>
so on.  As far as I'm concerned, the whole &quot;wretchedness&quot; thing SHOULD NOT
<br>
carry over into the Sysop Scenario, EVER, and that's a BIG part of the whole
<br>
point of doing this.
<br>
<p>But I also think that there's a direct grounding for the Minimal Living Space
<br>
idea in individual rights.
