Ben,
<br>
I only knew Sasha through e-mail, so I cannot make any valid comments about
<br>
his thinking as expressed in the conversations you had with him. But I am
<br>
curious about the fact that you never mentioned the formative effect on his
<br>
thinking of having grown up under a totalitarian socialist regime.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Sasha was driven to his libertarian philosophy by witnessing the
<br>
utter failure of Russian utopian socialism on its own terms: it did not
<br>
create the workers' paradise of wealth and freedom that it promised, but
<br>
rather delivered the complete opposite in the form of poverty and
<br>
oppression. And what happened in Russia has occurred in every other
<br>
&quot;scientific socialist&quot;/communist regime in history.
<br>
<p>It seems to be that the domain of economics and social systems is nearly as
<br>
paradoxical as quantum physics. If we strive for equality of outcomes, we
<br>
decrease the aggregate wealth while increasing the opportunities for a
<br>
ruling elite to grab a larger proportion for themselves. Paradoxically, if
<br>
we simply strive for freedom of opportunity, we increase the aggregate
<br>
wealth and also the gap between rich and poor, while at the same time giving
<br>
those poor an absolute (not relative) level of wealth than is much greater
<br>
than what they would enjoy under an egalitarian socialist regime.
<br>
<p>Go figure!
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael LaTorra

<p><p>There are many things to say on this topic, and for starters I'll say only a
<br>
few of them
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
This really gets back to the point that, although Sasha and I had very
<br>
different nominal political philosophies,
<br>
we actually lived our lives in very similar ways.  (Well, he was single,
<br>
whereas I'm married with 3 kids ... he
<br>
was a Russian immigrant and I'm not ... so we weren't exactly clones ... but
<br>
on the spectrum of human beings
<br>
we came pretty damn close together).  Only, I always felt guilty about not
<br>
spending more time helping the needy (not being comfortable with the &quot;ends
<br>
justifies the means&quot; approach),
<br>
whereas he always felt bad about not making a lot of money (because to him
<br>
money was an objective measure of value).
