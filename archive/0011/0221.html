Hello,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that sharing the backgrounds of people on this list, while 
<br>
irrelevant, is important because it demonstrates how the concept of the 
<br>
Singularity extends beyond individual culture, while at the same time gives us 
<br>
an idea of what resources we have available. So, even though I am more of an 
<br>
avid reader than a regular poster, I give up my own background.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a second year college student studying Electrical Engineering. I am 
<br>
relatively young; my interest in this list comes part and parcel with my 
<br>
youthful tendency to explore the world of ideas. This idea that I can barely 
<br>
grasp fascinates me, and so I have been doing the recommended reading. I have 
<br>
become convinced of the inevitability of the rapid approach of the 
<br>
Singularity, and so embrace this forum as a way to clear my head of the 
<br>
misconceptions several years of reading bad sci fi has instilled in me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your concern over how to reach the youth amuses me, because you (this list) 
<br>
have certainly reached this one, and I ask for your help and patience as I 
<br>
press the bounds of my imagination. Something as magnanimous as this 
<br>
Singularity concept covers many many fascinating ideologies, and is therefore 
<br>
easy to become mired. I intend to be in school for many years, and am 
<br>
interested in what everyone thinks I should pay particular interest in (as the 
<br>
Singularity pertains to engineering and the soft sciences in general,) so that 
<br>
I do not waste my time pursuing outdated concerns. What CAN I do as an 
<br>
electrical engineer to advance the Singularity? 
<br>
Alicia Madsen.
