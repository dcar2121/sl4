<p>Leaving out the whole SL5 part, which I'm not sure I understood (the
<br>
implication is that our true transhuman descendants will be shocked by the
<br>
life we lead today?  I didn't get that part), insanity - in most goal
<br>
systems - would be a major disadvantage, leading to all kinds of negative
<br>
outcomes.  If there really is a threat of insanity, then it'd be damned
<br>
silly to optimize away the extra 0.01% of storage space that contains the
<br>
very root of the causal chain, the part that marks the rest as
<br>
provisional.  And if there's the faintest, most remote chance of any
<br>
assumption being wrong - even in cases like &quot;Oh, the whole Universe was
<br>
just a computer simulation&quot; - then to mark that assumption as
<br>
&quot;undoubtable&quot; is not only a foolish risk, but is in fact outright untrue.
<br>
<p>On a deeper level, I disagree with the entire visualization this implies. 
<br>
Why can't we just say that transhumans can *deal* with it when their basic
<br>
assumptions get challenged?  That they don't have the *hardware* for
<br>
running around in circles, biting their own tails; that they just deal
<br>
with it, whatever it is, and move on.  Then you can optimize whatever you
<br>
like; if something goes wrong, you recognize it, de-optimize, and move on;
<br>
easy as clearing a cache.
<br>
<p>As humans, we get extremely emotionally attached to our own ideas.  This
<br>
happens for several reasons, of course; the two major ones are (a) the
<br>
political emotions, under which backing down from an idea is not only a
<br>
truth/falsity thing but also affects your social status; and (b) we have a
<br>
really lousy, hacked-up pleasure/pain architecture that causes us to
<br>
flinch away from painful thoughts.  &quot;Insanity&quot; *and* &quot;inability to deal
<br>
with change&quot; are not emergent phenomena that will appear in all
<br>
sufficiently complex minds.  Calling a phenomenon &quot;emergent&quot; always sounds
<br>
really enlightened, I know; but in this case, it's just not true - at
<br>
least, as far as we know.  Our vulnerabilities are traceable directly to
<br>
specific design errors, and there is really no reason to think that these
<br>
vulnerabilities would be present in minds in general.
