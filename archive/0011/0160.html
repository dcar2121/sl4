Subject: Ben's &quot;Extropian Creed&quot;
<br>
<p><p>This article is in reference to Ben Goertzel's FAZ article about
<br>
Extropianism,
<br>
&quot;The Extropian Creed&quot;, which may be found online and in English at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/extropians.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/extropians.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This group [...] wants to push ahead with every kind of technology as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast as possible - the Internet, body modification, human-computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synthesis, nanotechnology, genetic modification, cryogenics, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name it.  Along the way they want to get rid of governments, moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictures, and eventually humanity itself, remaking the world as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypereconomic virtual reality system in which money and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology control everything.  Their utopian vision is sketchy but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fabulous:  a kind of Neuromancer-ish, Social-Darwinist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Silicon-Valley-to-the-n'th-degree of the collective soul. 
</em><br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
Egads!  Silicon Valley is a stressed out junk version of some of our
<br>
beginnings.  It is not at all definitive of where we plan to go imho.
<br>
Social Darwinism?  Hardly.  Technology will make it possible for anyone who
<br>
wishes (in theory) to be as smart and capable as they wish to be (given
<br>
rewiring and augmentation and time enough).  Social Darwinism is
<br>
inapplicable.  Neuromancer is too dark.  We can do better.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there was a painful contradiction lurking here, not far beneath
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the surface.  And this personal contradiction, I believe, cuts right at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the heart of Extropian philosophy.  The libertarian strain in Sasha's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking was highly pronounced: Once he told me, tongue only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halfway in cheek, that he thought air should be metered out for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price, and that those who didn't have the money to pay for their air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be left to suffocate!   I later learned this was a variation on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard libertarian argument, often repeated by Max More, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect that the reason the air was polluted was that nobody owned it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - ergo, air, like everything else, should be private property.
</em><br>
<p>Metering air for a price has nothing essential to do with libertarianism nor
<br>
do notions that everything should have a price and those who can't pay
<br>
should simply die.  The notion that ownership equals or contributes to
<br>
cleanliness is extremely arguable.  
<br>
<p>Besides, who says we would need air?  
<br>
<p><p>[MUCH LATER:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the back of my mind is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision of a far-future hyper-technological Holocaust, in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyborg despots dispense air at fifty dollars per cubic meter, citing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn-of-the-millenium Extropian writings to the effect that humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to go obsolete anyway, so it doesn't make much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference whether we kill them off now or not.   And so, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians should be read, because they've thought about some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of our future more thoroughly than just about anyone else. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I also think that the key idea that makes their group unique --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the alliance of transhuman technology with simplistic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncompassionate libertarian philosophy - must be opposed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great vigor.  
</em><br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
This simplistic and uncompassionate philosophy is in the author's head
<br>
rather than in the minds of many people I know.  The author seems to like to
<br>
associate everything bad with that great dirty word &quot;libertarianism&quot;.  This
<br>
is quite childish and transparently biased.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Many of the freedoms the Extropians seek - the legal freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make and take smart drugs, to modify the body and the genome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with advanced technology - will probably come soon (though not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon enough for me, or them).  But I hope that these freedoms will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not come along with a cavalier disregard for those living in less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fortunate economic conditions, who may not be able to afford the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latest in phosphorescent terabit cranial jacks or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum-computing-powered virtual reality doodaddles, or even an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adequately nutritional diet for their children.  
</em><br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
There are fairly deep questions involved in what is and is not proper (and
<br>
actually leads to good results) concerning (relatively) poor.  Far from
<br>
being cavalier many of us seem to have strong motivations towards long hours
<br>
and hard work toward a future where most of the idiocies and sufferings of
<br>
today can actually be resolved.  The author seems to be caught in a static
<br>
model of the wealth and the universe.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I believe that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, for all our greed and weakness, have a compassionate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core, and I hope and expect that this aspect of our humanity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry over into the digital age - even into the transhuman age,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outliving the human body in its present form.  I love the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warmth and teeming mental diversity of important thinkers like Max
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More, Hans  Moravec, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Sasha Chislenko,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and great thinkers like Nietzsche - and I hope and expect that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities will outlast the more simplistic, ambiguity-fearing aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their philosophies.  Well aware of the typically human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictoriness that this entails, I'm looking forward to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of a cyberphilosophy beyond Extropianism -- a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanist transhumanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Here, here!  So am I.  
<br>
<p>==
<br>
Eliezer:
<br>
The fundamental argument of Libertarianism is not against charity; rather,
<br>
the
<br>
argument of Libertarianism is against government-compelled charity.  There
<br>
is
<br>
nothing immoral about a privately owned charity; rather, the Libertarian
<br>
objection is to charity funded by compulsorily collected taxation.  Some
<br>
Libertarians say that charity at gunpoint is immoral. 
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
By most definitions of morals it *is* immoral.
<br>
<p><p>eliezer.:
<br>
&nbsp;Others simply believe
<br>
that just about everything is less efficient when the government operates it
<br>
-
<br>
that the money that is taxed away for forced charity is spent inefficiently,
<br>
debilitates the economy, and often does so much direct damage that the poor
<br>
would be better off if the government simply set fire to the money.  There
<br>
may
<br>
be Libertarians who don't give a damn about the poor, but not many, and
<br>
probably no higher a proportion than among the general populace.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
Personally I believe that I do a lot more for the poor when developing
<br>
technology that increases human capabilities than I can ever do by being
<br>
taxed or even by devoting my life explicitly to the poor.  Certainly we have
<br>
major suffering through human stupidity and cruelty.  But human stupidity
<br>
and cruelty is only partially a moral problem and largely a problem of
<br>
relatively poor mentation, socialization and options within the current
<br>
context.  Change the context!
<br>
<p><p>eliezer:
<br>
I don't believe that, if you're poor, that makes ills that occur to you
<br>
desirable.  I don't believe that being poor makes you &quot;targetable&quot; for
<br>
anything.  I don't believe that it is morally better in any way if bad
<br>
things
<br>
happen to poor people instead of rich people.  I don't believe that society
<br>
is
<br>
healthier when bad things happen to poor people.  I don't believe that poor
<br>
people deserve poverty.  I am not a Social Darwinist of any kind.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
It really isn't about &quot;deserving&quot; in any case.  Deserving would require some
<br>
agency that determines desserts and dispenses them.  Reality is what it is,
<br>
not what you &quot;deserve&quot;.  But we can change what is within the bounds of what
<br>
is possible in reality.
<br>
<p><p>eliezer:
<br>
I also don't believe that the poor will be left out of the Singularity.  I
<br>
think that the successful seed AI will blaze straight to strong
<br>
transhumanity
<br>
and superintelligence and invent advanced nanotechnology, at which point the
<br>
cost of personal transcendence falls to zero.  I think that who gets to
<br>
participate in the Singularity will be determined by the answer of each
<br>
individual human to the question:  &quot;Hi!  Do you want to participate in the
<br>
Singularity?&quot;  You say &quot;Yes&quot;, you get uploaded, you run on your
<br>
six-billionth
<br>
of the mass of the Solar System; whoever you were before the Singularity,
<br>
you
<br>
are now a Citizen of Terran Space, coequal with any other Citizen.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
Actually I think only a relatively small percentage will say &quot;yes&quot;.  At
<br>
least for a while.  
<br>
<p>eliezer:
<br>
One of the major reasons I am *in* the Singularity biz is to wipe out
<br>
nonconsensual poverty.
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
Yes.  Although poverty is partially a relative thing.  I don't think
<br>
relative differences are necessarily bad in and of themselves.  I think a
<br>
lot of the &quot;problem&quot; will simply start to dissolve when many of its
<br>
underlying assumptions (like zero-sum, static wealth, us vs. them, scarcity
<br>
and so on) get severely deleted or mutated going into Singularity.  I do
<br>
feel that a lot of transhuman/extropian/singularitarian folks are carrying
<br>
too much baggage from the present and past that they, like everyone else,
<br>
need to let go of at some point in order to move forward more gracefully to
<br>
a future that truly fulfills their happiest dreams and more.  Perhaps part
<br>
of the alarm is over the mix of godlike powers with old style thinking and
<br>
assumptions.
