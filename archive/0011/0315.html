<p>Hi Eliezer,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've chosen to reply to this instead of your previous reply
<br>
(because I've got a thesis to write ;-) ). Your previous reply contained
<br>
many good points many of which I agree with, and I'll try to work what I'd
<br>
like to say into here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, in direct response to the above, CERN has recently
<br>
announced they have a Higgs candidate (they're ont going to be able to
<br>
confirm it however...) - this is the holy grail at the moment, and
<br>
understanding this and CP violation (hopefully measured at SLAC, but I'm
<br>
biased) could well open up those GUTs to direct experimental assault.
<br>
There are billions of people alive in the world today, millions of very
<br>
smart people - why shouldn't a vanishingly small fraction of them spend
<br>
their time inventing competing theories which can't yet be put to the
<br>
test? Even if they are barking up the wrong tree, creatively mapping out
<br>
possibilities for future investigation is better than doing reactionary
<br>
science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or, like relativity, the next major discovery may involve no changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever in our description of the particle families.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You talk about state vector reduction and the non-local nature of QM, and
<br>
I think you are suggesting that our next big breakthrough will be a
<br>
paradigm shift due to some deeper level of understanding gained there.
<br>
Well, it's a difficult problem, and most physicists are content to leave
<br>
it in the realm of philosophy rather than science (in much the same way as
<br>
the many worlds interpretation). Bell's theorem &quot;shows&quot; QM is non-local,
<br>
and there where a whole series of experiments in the late 80s/early 90s
<br>
(and probably more since then, but I haven't had time to keep up with
<br>
developments in this sub-field since I first studied it) that attempted to
<br>
prove this experimentally. There was also a recent macroscopic observation
<br>
of the collapse of the wavefunction [Physics World, about two issues ago].
<br>
Experiments such as these are already happening, and may give us further
<br>
insight, but then again we (~90% of the Physicists that have ever lived)
<br>
have been worrying about EPR for 7 decades and still haven't gotten
<br>
anywhere... it may be that there is nothing else to know and we've reached
<br>
the limit there. That hasn't stopped QM becoming relativistic QM, becoming
<br>
calculable quantum field theories, leading to the Standard Model.
<br>
Hopefully we still have some surprises beyond the SM... we need those
<br>
surprises if we're going to choose among theories and develop our models
<br>
further. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the number of Physicists around and the lack of
<br>
understanding in the fundamental areas of QM and GR, we probably need
<br>
better (ie: machine) intelligence to give us the breakthrough you predict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; GUTs throw hugely increasing amounts of complexity in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exchange for vanishingly small returns of prediction, and this should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enough to tell us that GUTs are on the wrong track.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we don't know until we put it to experiment! Is there substructure
<br>
below the three generations of fermions? Why the heirarchy of masses? More
<br>
importantly, do any of these questions matter to readers of this list? I
<br>
think they do. The study of symmetries and groups is connected with
<br>
particle physics (would the pioneers of QM have guessed this?), who knows
<br>
what advanced, and probably highly abstract, mathematics could be useful
<br>
to someone developing a complex system (such as an AI). On the other hand,
<br>
I make a lot of use of statistics (which I absolutely hate, and don't
<br>
really consider to be advanced math) - and this seems to appear
<br>
everywhere. Anything involving evolution, complex systems, many body
<br>
problems, seems to require statistical analysis at some point.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the day, to get from SL(n-1) to SLn we're going to
<br>
need people/entities that can take apart a complex problem and code up a
<br>
solution atomicly. I think approaching coding as an art, implementing ad
<br>
hoc functionality as required, will get one nowhere. I think most sensible
<br>
companies realise this is the case and don't hire artists for programmers.
<br>
(That said, I know companies which claim the opposite, perhaps just
<br>
because they don't want to alienate all the artists who form the majority
<br>
of the graduate pool).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our vision I'd guess we would absolutely need mathematically
<br>
literate programmers who (like yourself) have an eye on physics, and
<br>
probably biology and psychology also. Right now I'm firmly in the physics
<br>
side (but I do lots .. too much ... coding ;-) ) - my goal would be to
<br>
gain Knuth like abilities in my approach to coding whilst maintaining an
<br>
interest in the sciences.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with other posters who state we will absolutely need
<br>
mathematical models of mind. Hopefully, we'll develop them in tandem, as
<br>
has been the case (almost) for the history of modern physics.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan
