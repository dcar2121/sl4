<p>
I've been seeing the term &quot;individual&quot; bandied about a lot here in
<br>
relation to TI's. I think this is dangerous, as our concepts of
<br>
individualism are very much colored by the human condition. 
<br>
<p>First, I should give a little background about the kind of singularity I
<br>
am expecting. My intuition is that whatever &quot;magic&quot; advances in physics
<br>
provide, the laws of thermodynamics and the speed of light will remain,
<br>
and that these will be sufficient to keep a true singularity from
<br>
occurring.[1] (Regardless, the maximum rate of change on the S curve
<br>
that occurs will be pretty extreme, so it could be considered a
<br>
singularity in the colloquial sense.)
<br>
<p>Individualism requires a very low bandwidth and very high latency
<br>
between &quot;individuals&quot;, (compared to the state of affairs leading up to
<br>
the singularity.) Transhuman &quot;identity&quot; will instead be spread across
<br>
different scales.
<br>
<p>Here's where thermodynamics comes into play. As long as the universe has
<br>
a 3K thermal background, in order to create a node capable of harboring
<br>
a sufficiently advanced intelligence, the effect of thermal radiation on
<br>
whatever is used as the physical circuitry must be overcome by cooling.
<br>
<p>High capacity nodes will require a great deal of energy to be put into
<br>
cooling. As this energy will be dissipated as waste heat, the space near
<br>
such a node will be poor for other nodes; even if nodes are located
<br>
there, they must either waste more energy on cooling themselves or
<br>
accept lower capacity. Therefore, high capacity nodes will experience
<br>
greater latency from the rest of the noosphere, and the intelligences
<br>
that inhabit them will likely be more individualistic.
<br>
<p>Lower capacity nodes will be able to be placed in closer physical
<br>
proximity, which means that they will have lower latency, and will
<br>
harbor intelligences more on the &quot;hive mind&quot; model.
<br>
<p>Given that there will be a range of possible tradeoffs between
<br>
intelligence and latency, what choice(s) will transhuman society make?
<br>
<p>I think it most likely that the distribution of node capacities will be
<br>
logarithmic. Extremely high capacity nodes will be necessary for
<br>
conducting the most advanced thought, but their energy inefficiency will
<br>
make them few in number, compared to lower capacity nodes, and this rule
<br>
will apply over the entire spectrum of capacities.
<br>
<p>The implications of this distribution on political arrangements should
<br>
be apparent. Likely society will be ruled by a despotism, (one hopes
<br>
benevolent,) of the Powers. Democracy is only possible in human society
<br>
because we lie on a fairly tight bell curve.
<br>
<p>Of course the existence of such a distribution of nodes is not
<br>
sufficient to describe their arrangement. I like the idea of &quot;fractal
<br>
intelligences&quot; containing one fairly high capacity node, with a number
<br>
of lower capacity nodes associated with it.
