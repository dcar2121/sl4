Let's distinguish between a *gene* and an *allele*.
<br>
<p>A gene is a DNA sequence coding for a protein. An allele is
<br>
one particular version of the sequence. Different alleles
<br>
can lead to different traits in the adult organism. A gene
<br>
may code for eye color, but it's the particular allele that
<br>
determines *which* eye color.
<br>
<p>In discovering genes for intelligence, I'm sure that what
<br>
they've done is discovered correlation between intelligence
<br>
and allelic variation in those genes. What pro-GM parents
<br>
want are the 'intelligence alleles', i.e. the beneficial forms
<br>
of these genes.
<br>
<p>When gene therapy is performed now, it doesn't involve alteration
<br>
of the chromosomes that contain the defective alleles. Instead,
<br>
a whole new artificial chromosome or plasmid is introduced into
<br>
the cell, containing a copy of the desirable form of the gene.
<br>
This only works a small fraction of the time, so it's done in
<br>
bulk.
<br>
<p>With germline engineering, you're not trying to hack cells
<br>
already embedded in a body, so you can be more adventurous.
<br>
You could culture germ cells and point-mutate them over and
<br>
over, until you have the alleles you want. You could synthesize
<br>
the alleles you want and attempt to insert them directly into
<br>
the appropriate chromosomal loci. (Warning: if you do this
<br>
using splicing enzymes, rather than nanomechanically, watch
<br>
out that they don't chop up other parts of the genome too.)
<br>
<p>But even if, by 2004, we have the technique to create human
<br>
germ cells with a specified genotype, we still won't know what
<br>
they're going to grow into. We are nowhere near being able to
<br>
predict the effects of one altered gene on the rest. Without
<br>
a major prior advance in theoretical genetics, the first human
<br>
germline engineering is going to be all about trial and error.
<br>
So I don't expect a bountiful harvest of GM babies in 2004.
<br>
If it does happen, it'll be because irrational bio-exuberance
<br>
overrode concern for the welfare of our experimental offspring.
<br>
<p>Gene therapy in adults is a different story. It might be just
<br>
as risky, but self-experimentation will be more widely condoned
<br>
than experimentation on innocents. So by 2004 we may well have
<br>
people trying to hack their own brains via neural gene therapy,
<br>
since the technique is already available.
