Hey all,
<br>
I don't know if I really fit in, but I am here anyway so what the hell.
<br>
I have crappy webtv and couldn't HTML my way out of a blank web page. As
<br>
for hardware, well..... I can twist two broken wires together to
<br>
complete a circuit! I'm not all that book smart either (no college,
<br>
trade schools, etc..) and Josh Yotty might even think I am down right
<br>
dumb (kidding, i think ;) but I am here none the less. Basically, after
<br>
the y2k thing blew over I was desperate for a new &quot;end of the world as
<br>
we know it&quot; scenario. I was deeply disappointed that the world did not
<br>
end for I have totally wasted my life so far (in my eyes at least). Of
<br>
course, I needed to justified &quot;it&quot; (my wasted life) somehow, for come
<br>
y2k I would have the last laugh as all those ambitious people who worked
<br>
their asses off trying to get somewhere &quot;important&quot; did it for nothing
<br>
(how selfish can I get, right?). At any rate, the y2k thing never
<br>
happened so I was the one that ended up with the mud on my face (oh, and
<br>
yes, I stock pilled food, guns, and ammo). So, One late, late night
<br>
after the fact, I came upon Eliezer's sight and was in total shock, not
<br>
only by the inevitability of the singularity but by how smart the guy
<br>
was. Thus, I joined this list so to be kept up to date on the subject of
<br>
the singularity. Mostly I like the singularity because of its
<br>
unfathomable unpredictable aspects, for it's not just a doom and gloom
<br>
deal.... A step up from my last futuristic vision. I think I will rarely
<br>
have anything to really say on this list, however I do want to at least
<br>
say now that I think you are all very intelligent, you have allot of
<br>
wowific things to say, and I feel good about being amongst you and just
<br>
lurking about.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
-David
