<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; I also don't believe that the poor will be left out of the Singularity.  I
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and superintelligence and invent advanced nanotechnology, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which point the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost of personal transcendence falls to zero.  I think that who gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participate in the Singularity will be determined by the answer of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual human to the question:  &quot;Hi!  Do you want to participate in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity?&quot;  You say &quot;Yes&quot;, you get uploaded, you run on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six-billionth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the mass of the Solar System; whoever you were before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now a Citizen of Terran Space, coequal with any other Citizen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the major reasons I am *in* the Singularity biz is to wipe out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonconsensual poverty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben Goertzel, does that satisfy your call for a humanist transhumanism?
</em><br>
<p>ben:
<br>
Well, Eliezer Yudkowsky, it does and it doesn't...
<br>
<p>On the one hand, I'd like to say: &quot;It's not enough to ~believe~ that the
<br>
poor will automatically
<br>
be included in the flight to cyber-transcendence.  One should actively
<br>
strive to ensure that this happens.
<br>
This is a very CONVENIENT belief, in that it tells you that you can help
<br>
other people by ignoring them...
<br>
this convenience is somehow psychologically suspicious...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>samantha:
<br>
Actually, you have a problem.  Given Singularity or even many of the things
<br>
along the way, providing for everyone and healing them of their fundamental
<br>
ills and limitations would not be impossible.  But there is a little matter
<br>
of free will. Will you heal someone whose brain is underpowered (whether
<br>
through genetics, human condition, malnutrition or whatever) and is
<br>
therefore limited in their enjoyment of life and possibilities against their
<br>
will?  You can at best only prepare the feast.  No one can be forced to eat.
<br>
<p><p>Convience has nothing to do with it.  The reality is that you cannot solve
<br>
the problems of the poor within the same box.  You have to step out of the
<br>
box and modify the parameters.  Also you can't solve many problems with
<br>
merely earth-normal human brain power.  Those of us who have tried for any
<br>
amount of time know this deeply.  
<br>
<p>ben:
<br>
On the other hand,
<br>
<p>a) I'm not really doing anything to actively strive to ensure that this
<br>
happens, at the moment, because building
<br>
a thinking machine while running a business is a pretty all-consuming
<br>
occupation.  So to criticize you for doing
<br>
like I'm doing would be rather hypocritical.  Of course, once Webmind has
<br>
reached a certain point, I ~plan~ to
<br>
explicitly devote attention to ensuring that the benefits of it and other
<br>
advanced technology encompass everyone ...
<br>
but for all I know, so do you -- and anyway plans are far cheaper than
<br>
actions.  The best I can say for myself in this
<br>
regard is that half of my employees are in a third-world country, Brazil.
<br>
Of course, they weren't poor before i hired them,
<br>
but at least I'm pumping money into the country, which benefits everyone
<br>
there, including the poor (who are VERY poor,
<br>
not like the &quot;poor&quot; in the US who have cars and big TV's, etc.).
<br>
<p><p>samantha:
<br>
This may be (is) laudable but it doesn't address the problem that deeply.  
<br>
<p><p>ben:
<br>
b) hey, maybe you're right.  I don't KNOW that you're wrong....  Sometimes
<br>
you get lucky and the convenient
<br>
beliefs are the right ones!!
<br>
<p><p>I do have a mistrust of &quot;ends justifies the means&quot; philosophies -- but I
<br>
also know that sometimes
<br>
the end DOES justify the means...
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
That is not what you have here and I am surprised you see it that way.  It
<br>
looks to me like you want to both have humans as beings too limited NOT to
<br>
suffer some pretty outrageous conditions and have them not suffer these
<br>
conditions.  There is a bit of a contradiction imho.  As long as humans are
<br>
as they are and no more, you will have this kind of suffering.  
<br>
<p>ben:
<br>
Saying that the best way to help the poor is to bring the Singularity about
<br>
is definitely an &quot;ends justifies
<br>
the means&quot; philosophy -- because the means involves people like you and I
<br>
devoting our talents to bringing
<br>
the Singularity about rather than to helping needy people NOW....
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
Versus pouring our lives into &quot;good works&quot; that never have and never will
<br>
end the deplorable conditions?  Only transformation will do.  Bandaids and
<br>
fine sacrificial efforts are not sufficient.
<br>
<p>ben:
<br>
This really gets back to the point that, although Sasha and I had very
<br>
different nominal political philosophies,
<br>
we actually lived our lives in very similar ways.  (Well, he was single,
<br>
whereas I'm married with 3 kids ... he
<br>
was a Russian immigrant and I'm not ... so we weren't exactly clones ... but
<br>
on the spectrum of human beings
<br>
we came pretty damn close together).  Only, I always felt guilty about not
<br>
spending more time helping the needy (not being comfortable with the &quot;ends
<br>
justifies the means&quot; approach),
<br>
whereas he always felt bad about not making a lot of money (because to him
<br>
money was an objective measure of value).
<br>
<p>samantha:
<br>
That guilt is one thing that robs all of us of our power to be the most
<br>
effective possible.  That guilt does no one and certainly not the poor any
<br>
good.  It keeps us all in bondage.  The means and the end are as holy as it
<br>
gets and the sooner we see that the sooner we will all be running at full
<br>
power and the sooner the poor will truly be enriched maximally.
