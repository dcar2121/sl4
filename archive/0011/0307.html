<em>&gt; &gt; The door is open for a real mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; analysis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the lossiness and error-prone-ness of knowledge and inference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in minds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; various sizes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how you can possibly do this.  Given a specific physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, you can estimate the error rate of the underlying processes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate that, e.g., there is a 10^-50 chance of a single error
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurring in ten thousand years of operation.  I don't see how you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly get specific numbers for software errors in a program as complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Webmind, much less a human, much less a totally unspecified transhuman.
</em><br>
<p>You would need a branch of mathematics that does not currently exist,
<br>
i.e. a real &quot;complex systems science&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There will never be a real mathematical theory of mind that is less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex than a mind itself; no useful part of the mind will ever be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describable except by all the individual equations governing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transistor-equivalents or neurons.
</em><br>
<p>That is entirely ridiculous, in my view.  I have a mathematical theory of
<br>
parts of Webmind, and I know mathematical theories that explain how parts of
<br>
the human mind work (so far not the most interesting parts) ... see the
<br>
Journal of
<br>
Mathematical Psychology (at least 10% of the papers in there are of real
<br>
value ;)
<br>
<p>You can say &quot;There will never be a mathematical theory explaining the exact
<br>
dynamics
<br>
of a particular mind that is less complex than that mind itself&quot; -- but so
<br>
what.
<br>
Even physics doesn't explain the exact trajectory of a pendulum.  One is
<br>
seeking approximate
<br>
explanations, or more technically &quot;probably approximately correct&quot; (PAC)
<br>
explanations...
<br>
<p>We have theories of mind that we use all the time in practical dealings with
<br>
other beings.
<br>
Autistic people lack these; chimps have only simple ones.  I see no reason
<br>
why a mathematical
<br>
theory of mind can't bring together the kind of practical heuristics we use
<br>
in everyday mind-modeling
<br>
with the empirical data analysis we have in mathematical and statistical
<br>
psychology.
<br>
<p>I don't have such a theory right now -- though I've tried to sketch the
<br>
outlines in my books Chaotic
<br>
Logic and From Complexity to Creativity -- but you certainly haven't given
<br>
me a reasoned argument
<br>
as to why such a theory can't be achieved.
<br>
<p>As for getting precise numbers, why do you assume these are the only
<br>
possible outcome of a
<br>
mathematical theory?  Much of mathematics is non-numerical in fact --
<br>
algebra, topology, logic....
<br>
Certainly, one would expect to be able to prove things about the probability
<br>
that a system's error
<br>
rate lies in a certain interval, much more so than to be able to derive
<br>
exact numerical values
<br>
describing complex system states.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The wish for such a theory is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics envy.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that, rather, your view of what a mathematical theory ~is~ is
<br>
overly constrained by
<br>
what physics theories are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We live in a world where physical systems turn out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhibit all sorts of interesting, mathematically describable high-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors; but neither the biology of evolved organisms, nor the behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of evolved minds, nor the computer programs we design, exhibit any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendency.  If you took the sum of all the numbers in a computer's RAM and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plotted it over time, you might find that it danced an airy Gaussian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minuet around a mean, but I don't think you will ever find any behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more interesting than that - there is no reason why such a behavior would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist and no precedent for expecting one.  Mathematics is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraordinarily powerful tool which will never be useful to cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists.  We'll just have to live with that.
</em><br>
<p>I'm finding it hard to resist using unpleasant language in response to this
<br>
very
<br>
silly statement.
<br>
<p>How can you make such an emphatic, authoritative-sounding declaration
<br>
regarding a topic that you obviously know very little about!!
<br>
<p>Why the hell would you assume that statistical analysis is the only
<br>
mathematical analysis
<br>
one can do of digital or biological brains?  You can do more interesting
<br>
stuff than that with EEG's
<br>
for Christ's sake.  Ever study Walter Freeman's work on the chaotic dynamics
<br>
of the rabbit brain?
<br>
This is a long way from statistics.
<br>
<p>We now lack the data to study the dynamics of human brain/minds in detail,
<br>
but in 20 years when
<br>
we have PET or fMRI scans (which give spatial maps of the active regions in
<br>
the brain),
<br>
with the temporal resolution of EEG's, we'll have the ability to make 3D
<br>
movies of brain function,
<br>
and to apply intelligent data analysis techniques to these.  I'm willing to
<br>
bet you anything you
<br>
want that this will yield to a lot more interesting things than are revealed
<br>
by simple statistical
<br>
analysis of individual numerical parameters.
<br>
<p>In digital brains, the situation is much better, because we don't need fancy
<br>
quantum resonance
<br>
scans to measure a system's internal state.  We can generate vast tables of
<br>
numbers by logging the states
<br>
of the components of our AI systems.  These tables of numbers, I can tell
<br>
you from practical experience,
<br>
DO reveal interesting patterns going far beyond simple statistics, from
<br>
which it is possible to infer
<br>
interesting approximative models of mind structure/dynamics.  See Jim
<br>
Crutchfield's work on
<br>
&quot;Computational Mechanics&quot; for a review of one approach to automatically
<br>
inferring computational models of complex
<br>
systems from time series data -- my own approach to this problem is subtler
<br>
and more practical than his,
<br>
but along similar lines.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; The point is: We have sought out tasks that strain our cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; architecture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  And, at our current level of intelligence, staying sane - or rather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing a personal philosophy and learning self-knowledge - strains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these abilities to the limit.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a confusion.  Self-knowledge, in my view, will always stress
<br>
a system to the limit, because of its peculiar self-referential nature.
<br>
True self-knowledge is never possible... and the more complex you become in
<br>
order
<br>
to solve the problem of modeling yourself and others, the harder you become
<br>
to know
<br>
due to your increasing complexity...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have no ability to observe individual neurons.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, we can track the state of an individual neuron pretty well, the
<br>
problem is monitoring
<br>
more than a couple thousand at once, using current technology -- which will
<br>
surely be superseded
<br>
in a few decades...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, you can make up all kinds of reasons why AIs or transhumans might run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into minor difficulties decoding neural nets, failing to achieve complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfection, and so on.  But it looks to me like simple common sense says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, if we humans had all these abilities, we would have achieved vastly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than we have now.  No, we still might not be perfect.  But we would,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the very least, be vastly better.  And, given enough time, or given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman intelligence, we might well achieve effective perfection in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain of sanity.
</em><br>
<p>To me, your leap from &quot;vastly better&quot; to &quot;effective perfection&quot; is a huge
<br>
and
<br>
unjustified one..
<br>
<p>We are vastly better than ants in many senses, but nowhere near perfect in
<br>
any
<br>
objective sense...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I never wanted to ignore &quot;cognitive science&quot; issues.  The whole point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the post was to take the ball out of the mathematical court and drop-kick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it back into the cognitive one.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, where differ is then in our intuition about the relationship between
<br>
mathematics and cognitive science.  I think that a new kind of math is
<br>
needed to
<br>
transform cognitive science into a real science.  Perhaps AI's will help us
<br>
create
<br>
this new kind of math.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course.  But, though perhaps I am mistaken, it looks to me like your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs about transhumanity have effects on what you do in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here-and-now.  Certainly your projections about transhumanity, and your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions in the present, spring from the same set of underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, the fact that I believe transhumanity is possible has a huge impact on
<br>
my
<br>
life, since I spend a lot of my time actively trying to create it.  The fact
<br>
that
<br>
I believe transhumanity will probably be a good thing also has an impact...
<br>
otherwise
<br>
I wouldn't try to build it even though I think I know how.
<br>
<p>Beyond that simple level, my particular intuitions about transhumanity don't
<br>
affect my work
<br>
very much, and certainly not my personal life...
