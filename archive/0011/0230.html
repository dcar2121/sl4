</em><br>
<p>This is more of an SL3 than an SL4 topic; it's the sort of thing that ought to
<br>
appear in a FAQ rather than be discussed on the list.  It's not on the
<br>
frontiers of thought; been there, done that.  So unless there is a demand (on
<br>
*this* list) for extended discussion of the subject, this single reply should
<br>
probably stand as being the abbreviated version of an answer that should be in
<br>
the hypothetical FAQ.  (Of course, on the Extropians list, you can always get
<br>
an extended debate on any topic, no matter how settled.  &lt;smile&gt;)
<br>
<p>Basically, your question leaves out the entire concept of intelligence
<br>
enhancement and self-modification - and you'll note that static uploads are
<br>
listed under SL3 on the original &quot;Future Shock&quot; page.  A static upload might
<br>
go insane or spend a billion years on flower arrangements; who knows?  But I
<br>
can't see a transhuman upload as vulnerable to insanity, even leaving aside
<br>
fine-grained control of simulated neurology or the ability to self-modify.  A
<br>
transhuman should simply be able to think faster than the forces that are
<br>
responsible for insanity in biological humans - see any problems a mile away. 
<br>
And for uploads-turned-Powers, I can't even see asking the question.  Likewise
<br>
for uploads in a Sysop Scenario, who can write their own insurance policies.
<br>
<p>None of the uploads in _Diaspora_ are transhuman, but even they have the
<br>
ability to modify themselves better than that - they can run &quot;outlooks&quot; and so
<br>
on.  I would refer you to _Diaspora_ for further information.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, asking the question with respect to SETI seems illogical; it
<br>
would only take one sane civilization or one sane member of one civilization
<br>
to send out signals.  The Fermi Paradox still holds.  As for Diaspora-type
<br>
cosmic hammer blows, staying attached to the meat certainly wouldn't help, so
<br>
it's clear that this class of scenario only increases the urgency of uploading
<br>
- and that's all we need to know, isn't it?  And of course we, or at least the
<br>
Sysop in the Sysop Scenario, would need to keep an eye on physical reality. 
<br>
Who ever said otherwise?
