<em>&gt; Well Eliezer, I don't love discussions about discussions about discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about discussions...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I can't resist chipping in here...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I personally find your &quot;Bzzzzzzzt!&quot; strategy of moderation slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offputting, but not nearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough so to sign off the list, given that the discussion is fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting...
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  I shall consider alternatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, I would make the request more informally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All you had to do in this case was ask J.R. to be a little less flippant and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughtful in his posts, if that's what you wanted, rather than openly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calling them &quot;the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectually sterile posts of anyone I've ever known.&quot;  Frankly, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not very nice  ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is not the first time that J.R. Molloy and I have interacted.  I
<br>
don't think he's being flippant, and I don't think he's deliberately
<br>
playing the role of the Trickster.  I think he's being honest.  That being
<br>
the case, there's nothing I can ask him to do about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Second, if this didn't work, I would ask the person the same thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a PRIVATE e-mail, in stronger terms.
</em><br>
<p>That was the strongest visible alternative - but then I'm not only
<br>
controlling the list content, I'm exerting control over the list content
<br>
without the list members knowing it.  If Samantha Atkins threw a fit over
<br>
*that*, she'd have me cold.
<br>
<p>I could make the decision to announce that the list is moderated,
<br>
*invisibly*, by myself, and that I may at any time quietly ask anyone to
<br>
stop posting or reduce posting, without informing the list.  But that
<br>
would subtly shift the list focus from being &quot;the SL4 mailing list,
<br>
moderated by Eliezer&quot; to &quot;Eliezer's personal mailing list, with SL4
<br>
subject matter&quot;.  Mailing lists like that exist, are interesting, and
<br>
acquire subscribers, but that's not what I had in mind when I created the
<br>
SL4 list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Those who know me well, would laugh at me trying to pass myself off as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; master of social tact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I think that, in spite of being a misfit at heart, I've learned a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about politics from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helping run a business for the last few years....
</em><br>
<p>Undoubtedly, when I have run SL4 for a few years, things will be
<br>
smoother.  But, for the moment, I have to come up with solutions using the
<br>
experience I do have.  Although I don't *like* to look like I'm
<br>
overreacting or intolerant, I'm willing to run the risk if it maintains
<br>
post quality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I'm not as down on Molloy's and Spudboy's posts as you are,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either -- I see Molloy as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting in the tradition of the Trickster, subverting and contradicting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever is said, sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in obvious ways, occasionally in less obvious ones....  With very high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequency this would get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exasperating, but so far, it's amused me more often ..
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I trust your amusement.  We often pretend to ourselves that
<br>
we are amused at things we deeply and permanently hate - more fallout from
<br>
our badly designed goal systems.  Anyway, on the Extropians list, there
<br>
was a period when Molloy was replying to almost every single post; even
<br>
though most went unreplied, he had started to dominate the list by sheer
<br>
volume.  Molloy's posts do generate replies that are sometimes of value,
<br>
but they still wind up steering the conversation away from even more
<br>
interesting things.  But that's something you couldn't judge without
<br>
reading Extropians... which I don't really advise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I certainly sympathize with your desire to use this and other lists to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genuine conceptual progress,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than just to randomly chat.  On the other hand, a certain amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise &amp; chaos is necessary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to stimulate conceptual progress -- as is an attitude of openness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity, which &quot;Bzzzzzt!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not necessarily foster.
</em><br>
<p>I've often heard that tolerance has something to do with creativity, but I
<br>
think that this is a myth that gets repeated because it's a socially
<br>
acceptable thing to say.  I think that intolerance, especially
<br>
self-intolerance, of even the least little compromise of thought quality,
<br>
is the way by which we make qualitative improvements in our personal
<br>
philosophies.  I think it's intolerance that leads us to make major
<br>
changes in ourselves, and tolerance of imperfection which leads to staying
<br>
where you are, possibly making slight improvements every now and then, but
<br>
nothing drastic; not really going anywhere.
<br>
<p>I think that the really creative people tend to be totally intolerant of
<br>
imperfection within themselves, and this leads them to be intolerant of
<br>
imperfections caused by others.  This is not the politic attitude to take,
<br>
perhaps - and indeed, what I've described is a strictly internal attitude,
<br>
saying nothing about external speech.  But whenever I see a genuinely
<br>
creative person advocating tolerance and openness as an aid towards
<br>
&quot;brainstorming&quot;, my first impulse is to think &quot;meme infection&quot;.
<br>
<p>Noise and chaos, yes - but *quality* noise and chaos.  Not all noise and
<br>
chaos are useful just because they can be described by the &quot;noise&quot; and
<br>
&quot;chaos&quot; category labels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, I too appreciate you having set up this list, as this is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting e-mail discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had for a while (excepting internal Webmind Inc. ones)
</em><br>
<p>Thanks!
