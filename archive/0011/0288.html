<p>
Well Eliezer, I don't love discussions about discussions about discussions
<br>
about discussions...
<br>
but I can't resist chipping in here...
<br>
<p>I personally find your &quot;Bzzzzzzzt!&quot; strategy of moderation slightly
<br>
offputting, but not nearly
<br>
enough so to sign off the list, given that the discussion is fairly
<br>
interesting...
<br>
<p>My own taste would be, if I were in your position and I
<br>
wanted to reduce someone's postings that I perceived as irrelevant
<br>
or unproductive, to do so in a somewhat more low-key and less autocratic
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>First, I would make the request more informally.
<br>
All you had to do in this case was ask J.R. to be a little less flippant and
<br>
more
<br>
thoughtful in his posts, if that's what you wanted, rather than openly
<br>
calling them &quot;the most
<br>
intellectually sterile posts of anyone I've ever known.&quot;  Frankly, that's
<br>
not very nice  ;&gt;
<br>
<p>Second, if this didn't work, I would ask the person the same thing
<br>
in a PRIVATE e-mail, in stronger terms.
<br>
<p>Finally, if that didn't work, I would ban the person from the list.  (Which
<br>
sometimes really is
<br>
necessary in order to keep a list on-topic and reasonably articulate, as
<br>
I've seen on other lists.)
<br>
<p>Those who know me well, would laugh at me trying to pass myself off as a
<br>
master of social tact.
<br>
But I think that, in spite of being a misfit at heart, I've learned a bit
<br>
about politics from
<br>
helping run a business for the last few years....
<br>
<p>Personally I'm not as down on Molloy's and Spudboy's posts as you are,
<br>
either -- I see Molloy as
<br>
acting in the tradition of the Trickster, subverting and contradicting
<br>
whatever is said, sometimes
<br>
in obvious ways, occasionally in less obvious ones....  With very high
<br>
frequency this would get
<br>
exasperating, but so far, it's amused me more often ..
<br>
<p>I certainly sympathize with your desire to use this and other lists to make
<br>
genuine conceptual progress,
<br>
rather than just to randomly chat.  On the other hand, a certain amount of
<br>
noise &amp; chaos is necessary
<br>
to stimulate conceptual progress -- as is an attitude of openness and
<br>
creativity, which &quot;Bzzzzzt!&quot;
<br>
does not necessarily foster.
<br>
<p>Finally, I too appreciate you having set up this list, as this is the most
<br>
interesting e-mail discussion
<br>
I've had for a while (excepting internal Webmind Inc. ones)
<br>
<p><p>-- ben
