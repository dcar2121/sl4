<p>
Personally, I don't like masses of uninteresting chat in my email, but I
<br>
like even less to see people banned, or insulted.
<br>
<p>What I want is a way to filter posts so I can reduce the volume of
<br>
individuals who's posts rarely interest me, but nothing so drastic that
<br>
removes them completely.
<br>
<p>If every post had some meta data that said how 'chatty' is was, we could
<br>
tune out chatty posts. Sometimes you just want to add a 'me too' or some
<br>
quick clarification on a small point of interest. On my imaginary email
<br>
client I could move the 'chatty' slider up for this post &amp; send it without
<br>
fear of annoying anyone.
<br>
<p>Others would receive the post and if it was above their chatty threshold,
<br>
they wouldn't see it, but it's still there if they want to refer to it.
<br>
<p>To stop abuse of this feature, you could have a scale factor for each
<br>
individual in your clients settings. Anyone who thinks their posts are
<br>
really interesting but aren't, you simply scale down a slider by their name.
<br>
<p>Of course all this requires people to post meta data with their text.
<br>
Putting together a simple email client with a couple of sliders next to the
<br>
text would make this easy. For backward compatibility people could include
<br>
something like 'CHATTINESS=0.8' somewhere in their text, or have it added
<br>
automatically by the server (with default settings per person) before it's
<br>
relayed to everyone else.
<br>
<p>For receiving, people with regular email clients could tell the server (via
<br>
a web page) about their preferences &amp; it could filter messages for them.
<br>
<p>In addition, I'd like my email client to colour-code posters &amp; do away with
<br>
this antiquated '&gt;' indentation crap. We could also have standard subject
<br>
meta tags so people can filter on those. As a bonus, I also want to be able
<br>
to include sketches &amp; line art to make my points clearer but don't want to
<br>
force people to download them. Authentication could also be added on.
<br>
<p>This seems very basic to me. I don't understand why it hasn't been done
<br>
before. Or has it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm willing to spend a little time writing a simple java email client with
<br>
meta sliders if there's enough interest. Anyone willing to do the server
<br>
side stuff? Do we have a server we can use for this?
<br>
<p>Maybe we could even merge the list back into the Extropians list with
<br>
approprate meta tag support.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Dale.
