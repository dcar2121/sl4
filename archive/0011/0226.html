Hello gang,
<br>
<p>Firstly, I'm not a hardware guy. Machine code is about as low level as I go
<br>
(although I had fun with pirate radio transmitters when I was a youngster.)
<br>
<p>My background is software, mainly in the video games industry. I've been
<br>
programming for 18 years (since age 9), the last 10 professionally. I have a
<br>
wealth of experience writing efficient high-end 3D engines and realtime
<br>
rigid-body dynamics systems (Newtonian physics simulations). If we ever need
<br>
to build a Diaspora-style polis, I'm probably your man (although I doubt
<br>
such a quaint scenario would arise).
<br>
<p>However, my real passion is AI. After becoming disillusioned with the games
<br>
industry &amp; after trying to meet my objectives within it, I recently quit my
<br>
job (again) to work full-time on AI. It isn't easy without funding, but I'm
<br>
going to do it anyway. Unfortunately there are precious few of us working on
<br>
the real AI problem.
<br>
<p>I'm here on this list to offer my support to others working in the same
<br>
area, and to keep one eye open to make sure they don't f@ck up bigtime! :)
<br>
Real AI is seriously powerful.
<br>
<p>We need more critical thinking &amp; solutions into how we're going to make the
<br>
transition from here &amp; now to a post-humanist world. I've yet to hear the
<br>
pro's &amp; con's of various strategies. Personally I dislike leaving everything
<br>
up to a single growing mind.
<br>
<p>I'm currently kicking around a multi-AI scenario whereby there's a community
<br>
of similar minds and improvements are made only to one of them. If there's a
<br>
problem it can be dealt with by the others. Even if the modified AI has an
<br>
edge, it looses by weight of numbers. Any thoughts?... (perhaps on a new
<br>
thread).
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Dale Johnstone.
