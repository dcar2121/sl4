<em>&gt; &gt; I am not sure I agree with your exact phrasing.  I would rephrase

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1)  Once an AI system is smart enough to restructure all the matter of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Solar System into vis own mind-stuff, we will not be able to guide vis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development *if ve doesn't want us to*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if it wants us to, we may not have the intelligence to understand how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its mind works well enough to guide it...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much can a dog guide YOUR development?
</em><br>
<p>Not a difficult problem to discuss - let's see...
<br>
<p>One mental image that comes to mind on reading your question is that the
<br>
superintelligent AI, confronting a question of internal design, says:  &quot;Hey,
<br>
programmer, should I vesper my speems?&quot;  And the programmer can only shrug,
<br>
because ve doesn't know what the heck a speem is.
<br>
<p>A)  If speem-vespering is a strictly internal design question, however, then
<br>
it's hard to see why the AI would need the help - just choose the path of
<br>
greater efficiency, reliability, speed, coverage, et cetera.
<br>
<p>B)  If speem-vespering has humanly understandable moral consequences - if, for
<br>
example, speem-vespering is needed to stop the Solar System from turning into
<br>
a black hole - then the programmer should be able to say:  &quot;Yes, vesper the
<br>
speems, please.&quot;  (And in a simple, unambiguous case like that just discussed,
<br>
I'd hope the AI would know enough to decide without needing to ask the
<br>
programmer!)
<br>
<p>C)  If speem-vespering is a moral question that has no humanly understandable
<br>
consequences, then the most we can hope for is that the AI will make the same
<br>
decision that would be made by a transhuman - that is, someone who started out
<br>
as a sane, reasonably moral human, and upgraded, increasing the complexity and
<br>
depth of ver moral philosophy along with vis intelligence.  And we do this by
<br>
grokking, or asking the AI to grok, the way in which humans grow their own
<br>
moral philosophies; so that as the AI grows, it can grow its own moral
<br>
philosophy as well, preserving the original domain of Friendliness and
<br>
extending it to cover new questions.
<br>
<p>D)  If speem-vespering is a moral question that has no humanly understandable
<br>
component and which is entirely orthogonal to the entire realm of human moral
<br>
experience, so that nothing currently in our minds could have the slightest
<br>
bearing on speems one way on the other, then - by definition - neither you nor
<br>
I *care* what decision the AI makes, and the problem is one for the community
<br>
of future transhumans and the Sysop, not Friendly AI programmers in the
<br>
here-and-now.
<br>
<p>It is scenario C, of course, that I find most exciting, as it captures the
<br>
fundamental challenge of &quot;seed morality&quot;.
