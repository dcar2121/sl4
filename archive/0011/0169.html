<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damn straight.  The majority of Russian immigrants I've known have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitated to extreme right-wing views, as a direct reaction to their
</em><br>
first-hand experience of the
<br>
<em>&gt; inefficiency and terrifying oppressiveness of governments.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're talking about libertarianism, it has *nothing* to do with the
<br>
'right-wing' or the right in any sense. It is a separate concept from right
<br>
and left; it is authoritarian versus libertarian.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed in your writing that you tend to think of libertarianism as a harsh
<br>
or uncaring philosophy. I am a hardcore libertarian (an anarchist, in fact)
<br>
and I could not disagree with you more. Libertarianism is a loving philosophy,
<br>
and compassionate. Mary Ruwart wrote an excellent book on this topic, which
<br>
you can find here:
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the printed version is much easier to read.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose that, as in all living systems, the optimal politics is a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of balance.  Striving for pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equality fails, as does striving for pure individual freedom.  The correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is somewhere in the middle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and as for exactly where -- we have no science to tell us.  I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme libertarians are any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct than extreme communists ... but they've never taken over a country,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so this hasn't been proven ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ben
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what you mean by '... all living systems'. All living systems
<br>
require balance? I don't think so. I don't want a balance of plutonium in my
<br>
body, thank - or any at all, considering that it is lethal at 0.1 micrograms.
<br>
In fact, all the living systems we know require an *extreme* absence of
<br>
plutonium to survive. This is just one example of a practically unlimited
<br>
number of examples where living systems require an extreme, not a balance, and
<br>
there are even more where they simply thrive better.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for 'extreme libertarians' being no more correct than 'extreme
<br>
communists' - it is hard to argue this without knowing what you mean when you
<br>
say 'extreme' one or the other.. But my wife has something to say about this.
<br>
She spent her childhood in a communist country - Romania, which was quite
<br>
communist at the time. Her opinion is this: communism is a known evil that has
<br>
murdered more than one hundred million people in this century alone.
<br>
Libertarianism has no such track record.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in no way attempting to steer the conversation politically; but I cannot
<br>
allow such a beautiful philosophy to be misrepresented, especially when it is
<br>
so intimately, perhaps inextricably tied to extropian goals and ideal.
