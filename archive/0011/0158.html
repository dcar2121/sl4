<p>
There are many things to say on this topic, and for starters I'll say only a
<br>
few of them
<br>
<p>First of all, I am aware that libertarianism, and extropianism, are diverse
<br>
bodies of thought,
<br>
and that no two adherents to either of these philosophies can be expected to
<br>
agree with each other
<br>
except in fairly general terms
<br>
<p>I knew Sasha really well, and I think I have a deep understanding of what
<br>
his views were, and I don't
<br>
think I misrepresented them.  For all his warm-heartedness in person, I
<br>
think his intellectual view
<br>
really was Social-Darwinist.  I think that Moravec's views really are that
<br>
way too -- though, judging from
<br>
his writings, not from knowing him personally (which means I have a lower
<br>
degree of confidence in this case).
<br>
This doesn't mean I think Eliezer's views are the same.
<br>
<p>My apologies if I misrepresented things in this regard
<br>
in my article -- as anyone who has written journalistically knows, you're
<br>
always walking a fine line, wanting to
<br>
say things interestingly and excitingly and provocatively, but not to sayi
<br>
things sensationalistically
<br>
or even inaccurately.
<br>
<p>There are many possible beliefs here to be sure.
<br>
<p>One line of thinking, which Moravec often gravitates toward, is that humans
<br>
are basically inferior compared
<br>
to what's going to come after -- and we all die in the end anyway -- so
<br>
whether a few humans live or die
<br>
is ultimately not that crucial.
<br>
<p>Another line of thinking, which Sasha explicitly maintained in many
<br>
conversations with me -- and Moravec and
<br>
many other libertarians hint at in their writings -- is that the &quot;hi-tech&quot;
<br>
breed of humans is somehow superior
<br>
to the rest of humanity and hence more deserving of living on forever in the
<br>
grand and glorious cyber-afterlife...
<br>
<p>The former line of thinking is one I have some emotional sympathy for --
<br>
I've definitely felt that way myself
<br>
at some times in my life.  The latter line of thinking really gets on my
<br>
nerves.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I also don't believe that the poor will be left out of the Singularity.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that the successful seed AI will blaze straight to strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and superintelligence and invent advanced nanotechnology, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which point the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost of personal transcendence falls to zero.  I think that who gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participate in the Singularity will be determined by the answer of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual human to the question:  &quot;Hi!  Do you want to participate in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity?&quot;  You say &quot;Yes&quot;, you get uploaded, you run on your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six-billionth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the mass of the Solar System; whoever you were before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now a Citizen of Terran Space, coequal with any other Citizen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the major reasons I am *in* the Singularity biz is to wipe out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonconsensual poverty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben Goertzel, does that satisfy your call for a humanist transhumanism?
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, Eliezer Yudkowsky, it does and it doesn't...
<br>
<p>On the one hand, I'd like to say: &quot;It's not enough to ~believe~ that the
<br>
poor will automatically
<br>
be included in the flight to cyber-transcendence.  One should actively
<br>
strive to ensure that this happens.
<br>
This is a very CONVENIENT belief, in that it tells you that you can help
<br>
other people by ignoring them...
<br>
this convenience is somehow psychologically suspicious...&quot;
<br>
<p>On the other hand,
<br>
<p>a) I'm not really doing anything to actively strive to ensure that this
<br>
happens, at the moment, because building
<br>
a thinking machine while running a business is a pretty all-consuming
<br>
occupation.  So to criticize you for doing
<br>
like I'm doing would be rather hypocritical.  Of course, once Webmind has
<br>
reached a certain point, I ~plan~ to
<br>
explicitly devote attention to ensuring that the benefits of it and other
<br>
advanced technology encompass everyone ...
<br>
but for all I know, so do you -- and anyway plans are far cheaper than
<br>
actions.  The best I can say for myself in this
<br>
regard is that half of my employees are in a third-world country, Brazil.
<br>
Of course, they weren't poor before i hired them,
<br>
but at least I'm pumping money into the country, which benefits everyone
<br>
there, including the poor (who are VERY poor,
<br>
not like the &quot;poor&quot; in the US who have cars and big TV's, etc.).
<br>
<p>b) hey, maybe you're right.  I don't KNOW that you're wrong....  Sometimes
<br>
you get lucky and the convenient
<br>
beliefs are the right ones!!
<br>
<p><p>I do have a mistrust of &quot;ends justifies the means&quot; philosophies -- but I
<br>
also know that sometimes
<br>
the end DOES justify the means...
<br>
<p>Saying that the best way to help the poor is to bring the Singularity about
<br>
is definitely an &quot;ends justifies
<br>
the means&quot; philosophy -- because the means involves people like you and I
<br>
devoting our talents to bringing
<br>
the Singularity about rather than to helping needy people NOW....
<br>
<p>This really gets back to the point that, although Sasha and I had very
<br>
different nominal political philosophies,
<br>
we actually lived our lives in very similar ways.  (Well, he was single,
<br>
whereas I'm married with 3 kids ... he
<br>
was a Russian immigrant and I'm not ... so we weren't exactly clones ... but
<br>
on the spectrum of human beings
<br>
we came pretty damn close together).  Only, I always felt guilty about not
<br>
spending more time helping the needy (not being comfortable with the &quot;ends
<br>
justifies the means&quot; approach),
<br>
whereas he always felt bad about not making a lot of money (because to him
<br>
money was an objective measure of value).
<br>
<p>In other words, I'm happy enough to critique Extropianism as a collection of
<br>
words written down on paper,
<br>
a conceptual philosophy....  I'm happy enough to critique my friends, like
<br>
Sasha, whom I know well (and I know he
<br>
wouldn't mind me picking on him even after his death, he loved this kind of
<br>
argumentation).  But I have no desire
<br>
to pass judgment, positive or negative, on Eliezer and others whom I don't
<br>
know....  I guess this makes me a weirdo, but that's not really news now is
<br>
it...
<br>
<p>OK, I know that was not a satisfactorily articulate response, but I have a
<br>
lot of work to do so there you go for now...
