<em>&gt; In some areas, mathematics may turn out to be applicable, when particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems have underlying behaviors that turn out to give rise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical dynamics.  This would be especially expected of systems in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which some quantity is conserved, or in which there is an analogue to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential energys surfaces, or where you can use statistical mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to describe systems containing a stochastic element, and so on.
</em><br>
<p>You're listing the physicist's mathematical toolkit, but I suspect that the
<br>
right
<br>
math for complex systems like the mind/brain will be something different...
<br>
think: (abstract algebra + algorithmic information theory + functional
<br>
analysis)/3
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, where differ is then in our intuition about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mathematics and cognitive science.  I think that a new kind of math is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needed to transform cognitive science into a real science.  Perhaps AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will help us create this new kind of math.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is exactly and precisely the vision that I disagree with.-
</em><br>
<p>Well I hope we both live long enough, in one form or another, to find out
<br>
who
<br>
was right ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cognitive science will not become a real science as the result of math.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will not advance as a result of advances in mathematics.  As we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the mind better, cognitive science will approach computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming.  And the best computer programmers are not computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientists; they are hackers.  Now, any hacker gets a bonus to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitive understanding by understanding complexity theory and computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science and potential energy surfaces and, in fact, everything under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sun - but actual computer programming uses very little mathematics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes a hacker winds up in a mathematical situation, yes;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryptographers do, and sometimes the parallel processing people need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resort to &quot;something more complicated than simple arithmetic&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the behavior of resource wait times and so on.  But these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exceptions, not the rule.
</em><br>
<p>In building Webmind, it is the rule, not the exception.  You  may say this
<br>
is because I'm taking the wrong approach in building Webmind, but I don't
<br>
think
<br>
so....  engineering a mind is very different from engineering most other
<br>
things, and
<br>
one of the differences is that the dynamics is very complex, so that
<br>
mathematical
<br>
concepts are much more useful than they are for thinking about most software
<br>
systems
<br>
<p>And I acutely feel the lack of an operational math of very complex systems
<br>
like Webmind --
<br>
I feel that we'll be developing one as we go along, to keep the conceptual
<br>
progress &amp;
<br>
engineering progress properly aligned...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In computer programming we build upwards, and mathematics is useful for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digging downwards.  The farther upwards we build, the farther we get from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics.  Sometimes the low-level behavior of our own systems starts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to contain an element we didn't plan on, and we then have to debug it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using mathematics - thread resource conflicts, for example.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *frontier*, the cutting edge, the place where we're building one step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher and inventing something new, will never involve somebody solving an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equation to find out what to invent, because equations can't tell us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.  The interesting, high-level parts of the mind will resemble the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece of code you're playing with and that you didn't need any mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to write, rather than the one time in a month that you needed an actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equation to describe memory pool allocation conflicts as a function of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage of utilization -
</em><br>
<p>My experience is that the interesting ~emergent~ behaviors that come out of
<br>
the interaction
<br>
of various mind modules, can only occur because of mathematical insight
<br>
applied to the
<br>
particular workings of these modules.  We don't yet have a mathematics
<br>
that's really useful for
<br>
understanding the emergent behaviors -- but I believe that the data we
<br>
gather while experimenting
<br>
with various versions of Webmind will help us to get there.
<br>
<p>I understand your intuition now and I can't say that it's an invalid or
<br>
senseless intuition, it's
<br>
plausible enough.  I just think it's wrong... not only does it contradict my
<br>
intuition, it contradicts
<br>
my own recent experience on &quot;the *frontier*, the cutting edge... inventing
<br>
something new&quot; ...
<br>
<p>If you can engineer a thinking machine without using math as a significant
<br>
component, more power to you!
<br>
You're smarter than us, or have a better intuition.
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong -- there's more intuition than math in the Webmind
<br>
design. But without mathematical
<br>
analysis applied to key parts -- not just system-level parts like memory
<br>
pool allocation -- it just
<br>
wouldn't work.
<br>
<p>Here's one way to think about it: Evolution often arrives at optimal
<br>
solutions by long experimentation.
<br>
If we want to avoid simulating millions of generations of evolution, we need
<br>
to get at these optimal
<br>
solutions in the first few experiments....  Mathematics is a way of doing
<br>
this, in many contexts.  It doesn't
<br>
tell you how to structure the mind (at least not yet).  It helps you figure
<br>
out how to get the general
<br>
structure you've intuitively conceived to ~actually~ work.
<br>
<p>I think you're kidding yourself that you can hack a thinking computer
<br>
program.  But, I could be wrong.
<br>
I dare you to show me I'm wrong  ;&gt;
