<em>&gt; &gt; i wonder to myself, is anyone out there, especially in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circles,working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on a better hardware? not just a faster computer, but something entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; new?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just curious. i haven't seen anything that would indicate that that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular line of research is happening. Of course, maybe i'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the  right places...
</em><br>
<p><p>I have thought a bit about how to make better hardware, but have not come
<br>
close
<br>
to implementing anything
<br>
<p>The general conceptual principles underlying one possible new and better
<br>
kind of computer
<br>
can be found at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/1997/Qc.html">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/1997/Qc.html</a>
<br>
<p>The design described there is a totally impractical &quot;proof of concept&quot; that
<br>
Evolutionary
<br>
Quantum Computing can work...
<br>
<p>I have thought, since that time, of some ways to make a somewhat more
<br>
practical prototype, but
<br>
haven't come up with anything truly viable for making a large-scale machine
<br>
of this type.
<br>
<p>Anyone with expertise in solid-state or low-temperature physics who'd like
<br>
to brainstorm on this project, by all means
<br>
pipe up!!
<br>
<p>Some interesting work on quantum robotics was done at Neutronics Tech Corp,
<br>
but
<br>
<a href="http://neutronicstechcorp.com">http://neutronicstechcorp.com</a> seems no longer to exist -- perhaps they ran
<br>
out of money
<br>
<p>Some of their papers still are online...
<br>
<p><a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/18242/gather/cgi-bin/theory/3.html">http://library.thinkquest.org/18242/gather/cgi-bin/theory/3.html</a>
<br>
<p>I tend to be very skeptical of their work but they did build a nifty little
<br>
robot using their principles...
<br>
<p>When I was in Perth, there was a company called Formulab Neuronetics which
<br>
was building a nifty neural-nettish hardware
<br>
system, being used initially for process control.  I can't find any
<br>
technical information on them in the Web at the moment
<br>
though.  The messages at <a href="http://www.mitronet.com/chipdir/oth/richter2.txt">http://www.mitronet.com/chipdir/oth/richter2.txt</a>
<br>
tell you a little...
<br>
<p>So, yeah, there's lots of this type of work going on, around the fringes of
<br>
the mainstream CS community.  However, none of it
<br>
has become competitive with the standard hardware computing paradigm, which,
<br>
whatever its flaws, has a FUCK of a lot of money
<br>
and effort being poured into it at present
<br>
