<p>
(The original post was cc:ed to extropians, so this one
<br>
is going there too.)
<br>
<p>Eliezer described three ways of throwing away entropy - an
<br>
enabling technology for perpetual motion, since this would suck
<br>
some energy back from thermal equilibrium. It was just a long
<br>
detour in his post, but I want to correct some mistakes, and
<br>
make some simple comments. The issues involved are quite subtle
<br>
in my opinion, so I'll probably make mistakes of my own, but
<br>
better to mail now than wait until morning.
<br>
<p>First, the mistakes:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The first law of thermodynamics states that &quot;You can't win&quot;; you cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decrease the amount of entropy in the Universe.
</em><br>
<p>This is the second law. The first law is conservation of energy.
<br>
<p>And: Hamiltonian != phase space. The Hamiltonian is a function
<br>
on phase space, whose value is the total energy, and in terms
<br>
of which you can write Hamilton's version of the laws of motion.
<br>
<p>Now, some more substantive comments.
<br>
<p>- The negative-energy PMM
<br>
<p>Paul Davies talks about negative-energy perpetual motion
<br>
machines at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980321/features.html">http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980321/features.html</a>,
<br>
along with the extra influences that would stop them working.
<br>
<p>I would take issue with the description of phase space
<br>
here. Suppose you have a world in which particles can be
<br>
created and destroyed. This doesn't mean that phase
<br>
space changes in size each time that happens, it means that
<br>
phase space is the union of zero-particle phase space,
<br>
one-particle phase space, two-particle phase space, etc.;
<br>
and when a particle is created, you move from the N-particle
<br>
region to the (N+1)-particle region.
<br>
<p>- The quantum collapse PMM
<br>
<p>The proposal here is pretty vague. It's just, 'what if
<br>
entropy-increasing processes somehow acquired very low
<br>
probability'.
<br>
<p>There is a 'quantum thermodynamics', it's called statistical
<br>
mechanics, and entropy still increases there. There's interesting
<br>
recent work in quantum information theory which suggests that
<br>
entropy and entanglement are related, and maybe there will be
<br>
distinctively quantum ways to *locally* decrease entropy ... but
<br>
there's no inkling of a global violation of the second law.
<br>
<p>Once again on phase space ... You can conceive of a
<br>
quantum state as a wavefunction on a classical state space,
<br>
or as a point in Hilbert space, but in neither case does
<br>
'phase space'(*) itself change size when a wavefunction collapses.
<br>
In the first case, the wavefunction is suddenly restricted to
<br>
a small region of state space; in the second case, the state
<br>
vector jumps to a different point in Hilbert space.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(*) Technically, I'd rather say 'configuration space', since
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;phase space refers to a space which has a position *and*
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a momentum coordinate for each degree of freedom, and neither
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hilbert space nor the space upon which a wavefunction is based
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is like that.
<br>
<p>- The time-travelling Maxwell's-demon PMM
<br>
<p>This I haven't quite heard before, although I daresay someone
<br>
who studies wormholes has thought about thermodynamics in
<br>
wormhole spacetimes.
<br>
<p>But there's a hidden energy cost in waiting for the low-entropy
<br>
states to come along. It takes energy to register the current
<br>
state and decide whether it's low entropy. So entropy will be
<br>
generated by the selection process. This is the parable of
<br>
Maxwell's demon.
<br>
<p>As for phase space here ... the Hamiltonian framework describes
<br>
the state of the universe by a point in phase space, and the
<br>
history of the universe by a path in phase space. A universe
<br>
with time travel is probably better described in some other
<br>
way, since it likely can't be divided up into a simple series
<br>
of 'spacelike surfaces', it will have some more complicated
<br>
topology.
