<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The perfectly infinite multiverse presents unlimited existential awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to any intelligence (human or SI) that can grok it. &quot;Does SI have Buddha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature?&quot; asked the sanyasi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Mu&quot; replied the master.
</em><br>
<p><p>Sure... my statement about the limitations of finite minds was made from the
<br>
perspective of science &amp;
<br>
mathematics...
<br>
<p>If one wants to go beyond science into spiritual domains, then, that's a
<br>
whole different story -- not
<br>
unrelated, but different...
<br>
<p>Effectively, the notion of the infinite is the core of the notion of the
<br>
divine ... it's the ineffable...
<br>
that which goes beyond all our possible conceptions.
<br>
<p>It's really independent of future technology, even of the Singularity --
<br>
it's always there, or else it
<br>
is never there... depending on what you mean by &quot;there&quot; ;&gt;
<br>
<p>When I said that SL5 is everyday life, I was slightly questioning the whole
<br>
notion of &quot;shock level&quot; -- and
<br>
mostly probing its psychological meaning...
<br>
<p>Indeed, openness to future technologies is important... future technology
<br>
is shocking because of assumptions we've made about what's real and definite
<br>
and what isn't.  Getting over
<br>
the shock is a way of penetrating through some of the veil of illusion that
<br>
surrounds us because of our
<br>
finite minds.
<br>
<p>But everyday
<br>
life can shock us by shattering our assumptions, just as well -- if we look
<br>
at everyday life in the &quot;right&quot;
<br>
way.  (Not the way of ordinary waking consciousness.)
<br>
<p>The Singularity is a powerful notion because it makes us question the
<br>
notions of mind, world, individuality,
<br>
intelligence, ethics, and so forth.  But everyday life can make us questions
<br>
these things too -- it does so
<br>
for me all the time...
<br>
<p>Is it possible for someone not to be shocked by super duper futuristic
<br>
technology at all, but still to hold
<br>
onto all sorts of rigid, fixed beliefs in completely different domains (for
<br>
instance, the political
<br>
domain?).  If so then someone's technological shock level is far from an
<br>
indicator of the complete genuine
<br>
open-ness of their minds....
<br>
<p>Which is fine.  But it means that, even after someone has adjusted their
<br>
minds
<br>
to the possibility of the Singularity (SL4), they may still not have
<br>
adjusted their minds to question many
<br>
other, more basic things....
<br>
<p>This seems to me to tie right back into the political discussion we were
<br>
having.  It seems to me that
<br>
a single person can
<br>
<p>a) accept the coming obsolescence of the individual self and the ultimate
<br>
melding into a superintelligent supermind --
<br>
a remarkable flexibility of mind and suspension of consensus belief
<br>
systems -- but then,
<br>
<p>b) not deeply question the simplistic notion of &quot;individuality&quot; underlying
<br>
libertarian politics?
<br>
<p>This kind of human contradictoriness suggests that a division into those who
<br>
&quot;get it&quot; and those who don't is not
<br>
really right.  It may be people who don't seem to get it, who actually adapt
<br>
best when the new technologies come along,
<br>
because their minds are open in ways other than explicit conscious
<br>
acceptance of new technologies...
<br>
<p>I could see writing an SF story in which the hi-tech gurus who thought they
<br>
were totally acclimated to future
<br>
tech, turned out really to be scared of it on a core level when it came
<br>
about; whereas others who couldn't give a hoot about technology were
<br>
actually more accepting of deep changes, because their minds as a whole were
<br>
more open and accepting and
<br>
flexible...
