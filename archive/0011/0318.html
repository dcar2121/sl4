</em><br>
<em>&gt; many good points many of which I agree with, and I'll try to work what I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to say into here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Firstly, in direct response to the above, CERN has recently
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding this and CP violation (hopefully measured at SLAC, but I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biased) could well open up those GUTs to direct experimental assault.
</em><br>
<p>I could be wrong about the whole GUT thing.  On the other hand, though, we
<br>
could simply see a continuation of the situation today, where all the new
<br>
data to come out of these experiments simply winds up disproving the
<br>
existing theories so that even more complex GUTs must be invented to
<br>
explain the new data.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are billions of people alive in the world today, millions of very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart people - why shouldn't a vanishingly small fraction of them spend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their time inventing competing theories which can't yet be put to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test? Even if they are barking up the wrong tree, creatively mapping out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities for future investigation is better than doing reactionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science.
</em><br>
<p>Like I said, a physicist's salary is never wasted.  But even better would
<br>
be barking up the right tree.  In any case, my original objection was not
<br>
to some people pursuing GUTs, but rather to the blind spots implied by
<br>
ruling out theories which predict closed timelike curves or regarding
<br>
state-vector reduction as philosophical rather than physical, which rules
<br>
out alternative avenues of theoretical and experimental exploration that I
<br>
think would yield better results than GU theory and accelerator
<br>
experiments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You talk about state vector reduction and the non-local nature of QM, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you are suggesting that our next big breakthrough will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradigm shift due to some deeper level of understanding gained there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it's a difficult problem, and most physicists are content to leave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it in the realm of philosophy rather than science (in much the same way as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the many worlds interpretation). Bell's theorem &quot;shows&quot; QM is non-local,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there where a whole series of experiments in the late 80s/early 90s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and probably more since then, but I haven't had time to keep up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developments in this sub-field since I first studied it) that attempted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove this experimentally.
</em><br>
<p>I was under the impression that EPR/Bell inequalities had been definitely
<br>
predicted by a known theory and thoroughly verified experimentally as a
<br>
matter of form, on the same order as SR.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There was also a recent macroscopic observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the collapse of the wavefunction [Physics World, about two issues ago].
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know.  It's one of the reasons I'm allowed to advocate experiments
<br>
in this area.  ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Experiments such as these are already happening, and may give us further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insight, but then again we (~90% of the Physicists that have ever lived)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been worrying about EPR for 7 decades and still haven't gotten
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere... it may be that there is nothing else to know and we've reached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the limit there.
</em><br>
<p>No way!  If physics can't say what physical arrangement constitutes an
<br>
&quot;observation&quot;, then there's a pretty darn big hole - one that can
<br>
presumably be fixed by experiment.  As for those 7 decades... well, let's
<br>
face it, progress in physics has always been made by - or at least,
<br>
attributed to - individual geniuses and their bright ideas, not by slow
<br>
slogging.  That whole drama is the reason why physicists get plagued by
<br>
crank letters and why the media always treats physics as the queen of
<br>
sciences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         Given the number of Physicists around and the lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding in the fundamental areas of QM and GR, we probably need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better (ie: machine) intelligence to give us the breakthrough you predict.
</em><br>
<p>I really don't think mortal physicists have reached the point where they
<br>
need to give up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; GUTs throw hugely increasing amounts of complexity in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; exchange for vanishingly small returns of prediction, and this should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; enough to tell us that GUTs are on the wrong track.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, we don't know until we put it to experiment! Is there substructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below the three generations of fermions? Why the heirarchy of masses? More
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importantly, do any of these questions matter to readers of this list? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think they do.
</em><br>
<p>Well, *I'm* interested, but it doesn't really matter to AI unless you can
<br>
build a faster computer.  And even if they confirm the Higgs boson
<br>
tomorrow, we still won't have ultrafast Higgsium computers until Saturday
<br>
at the earliest.
<br>
<p>Quantum computers are another issue entirely - a hopeful sign.  Once
<br>
actual non-physicist engineers start *caring* about when state-vector
<br>
reduction occurs, the philosophical perspective won't hold for long. 
<br>
Technology does sometimes drive physics - in fact, it was that way during
<br>
a lot of the glory days, from Watt and steam to Manhattan and Feynman. 
<br>
Who knows?  The glory days may be coming back.
