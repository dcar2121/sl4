<em>&gt; But I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see a transhuman upload as vulnerable to insanity, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaving aside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fine-grained control of simulated neurology or the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-modify.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman should simply be able to think faster than the forces that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for insanity in biological humans - see any problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mile away.
</em><br>
<p>Frankly, I think this is an excessively Utopian point of view
<br>
<p>First: I don't think that insanity has to do with thinking fast or thinking
<br>
slowly -- if so, why
<br>
do intelligent people go nuts just as often as stupid people?  Of course,
<br>
you could say that
<br>
insanity is cured by fast thinking only once thinking gets beyond a certain
<br>
critical threshold
<br>
of speed, but this seems like &quot;special pleading&quot;...
<br>
<p>Second: It's a better argument that a system with the ability to modify
<br>
itself, would be able to
<br>
fix the types of problems we refer to as 'insanity' -- or ask others to fix
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>This second argument makes some sense.  It's not fast thinking, but rather
<br>
the ability to modify
<br>
one's 'hardware', that will eliminate a lot of what we call insanity from
<br>
transhuman minds...
<br>
<p>However, even self-modification isn't necessarily a magic cure for
<br>
craziness.  Much insanity is
<br>
motivational and emotional in nature -- with cognitive consequences that
<br>
follow from these underlying
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>I.e., why can't a transhuman get into a state where it's nuts and doesn't
<br>
want to modify itself into
<br>
&quot;non-nuts-ness&quot;?  In this case, should other transhumans intervene and fix
<br>
its mental structures, so it's
<br>
not nuts anymore?  This will presumably almost always be possible (although
<br>
there may be tough mathematical
<br>
problems in determining how to tweak someone's mind to leave them with their
<br>
&quot;self&quot; but not their insane
<br>
features) ... at least to some extent... but even so this gives rise to
<br>
serious ethical issues to do with
<br>
individual freedom.
<br>
<p>I do not believe that you guys have resolved this issue in a definitive way.
<br>
It seems, rather, that you've
<br>
brushed the issue aside due to optimism and confidence in the power of
<br>
intelligence (a habit that I also
<br>
possess, to be sure).
<br>
<p>In my view, it's wrong to consider it likely that transhuman minds will be
<br>
driven nuts by the blurring of
<br>
the mind-reality boundary.  But it's also wrong to say that transhumans will
<br>
be intrinsically sane due to their
<br>
intelligence and self-modifying abilities.
<br>
