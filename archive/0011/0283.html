<p>You're right about that. I tend to get carried away sometimes. No doubt
<br>
plenty of perfectly sane people will not be required to think about
<br>
technological singularity, and probably shouldn't.
<br>
I was trying to express my feeling that something as all-encompassing as a
<br>
real, great big honking Singularity will require all the talent,
<br>
intelligence, wisdom, and sanity that humanity can muster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that most people are not sufficiently open-minded to be
</em><br>
convinced to
<br>
<em>&gt; take a notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the Singularity seriously
</em><br>
<p>Now there you go again, calling it a &quot;notion.&quot; I admit that many other
<br>
possible/probable scenarios may render the singularity just a notion
<br>
(someday), but to the degree that we can see the singularity as the most
<br>
satisfactory response to urgently needed change, should we continue to
<br>
view it as a notion? I mean, before the Manhattan Project, atomic energy
<br>
was just a notion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Opening up human minds is a huge task in itself, and the place to start
</em><br>
if
<br>
<em>&gt; one wants to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this task is probably not with the Singularity...
</em><br>
<p>Right. The Singularity will be the *last* thing to open up human minds,
<br>
just before it disassembles them to use their atoms for increased SI
<br>
memory demands.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once Webminds, Eliezer-minds, or other reasonably intelligent AI's are
</em><br>
out
<br>
<em>&gt; there, the public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness will get used to AI, and then the Singularity will become
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;thinkable&quot; among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the  majority of people...
</em><br>
<p>That sounds like a very calm, reasonable, considered, and careful
<br>
approach. If, however, the Singularity is something other than a notion,
<br>
then it seems to me what the majority of people need is a strong shock to
<br>
wake them up to the accelerating advance of a life form as different from
<br>
us as we are from bacteria. As I see it, the Singularity (the quickening,
<br>
hyperplexity, the fourth stage of evolution, etc.) reveals itself
<br>
beforehand to people who are already wide awake and a little bit edgy. In
<br>
addition, since the Singularity will incorporate (in more ways than one)
<br>
superintelligence, it will be able to solve problems much better and
<br>
faster than humans or teams of humans can do so. In other words, it will
<br>
be able to solve any public relations problems better and quicker than the
<br>
public can invent them.
<br>
<p>So what's at issue here is not how to present the Singularity to a
<br>
reluctant public, but rather how to bring about the Singularity before the
<br>
truly unthinkable happens, namely humanity blowing itself up in yet
<br>
another global holocaust born of tribal conflicts.
<br>
<p>The limitations of a superintelligence will probably be more clear to the
<br>
SI than to us, no matter how well we may console ourselves that the SI
<br>
does in fact have limitations. Just for kicks, ask yourself if the
<br>
Singularity and its attendant SI is so smart, won't it be able to figure
<br>
out how to make itself &quot;thinkable&quot; among the majority of people...
<br>
<p>Stay hungry,
