<p>
Hi,
<br>
<p><p>Here is an attempt to get a little more clearly at ONE of the points raised
<br>
in my &quot;enigmatic&quot; (i.e. baffling
<br>
and confusing ;) e-mail from this morning...
<br>
<p>My claim, in this e-mail, is that any mind, even a superintelligent
<br>
supermind, necessarily is going to suffer from a certain
<br>
lack of wisdom, if it tries to maximize its intelligence.
<br>
<p>In other words: Given a fixed amount of resources, there is a kind of
<br>
uncertainty principle between intelligence
<br>
and &quot;wisdom/enlightenment/true-mental-health.&quot;  To maximize either one is to
<br>
decrease one's strength in the other.
<br>
<p>Humans have evolved to maximize intelligence rather than the other...
<br>
<p>My argument here can be cast in mathematical terms, but here, I'll given an
<br>
intuitive version.
<br>
<p>Let us begin with the philosophical thought of David Bohm, the late
<br>
quantum-physicist-turned-philosopher. One of the last books Bohm wrote
<br>
before his death, &quot;Thought As a System&quot;, is wonderfully relevant to these
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p>Bohm's views on mind are substantially in sympathy with my &quot;psynet model&quot;
<br>
(though far less intricately developed).  He pictures thought as a system of
<br>
reflexes -- habits, patterns -- acquired from interacting with the world and
<br>
analyzing the world. He understands the self-reinforcing, self-producing
<br>
nature of this system of reflexes -- the emergence of autopoietic
<br>
subsystems. And he diagnoses our thought-systems as being infected by a
<br>
certain malady, a malady which he calls the absence of proprioception of
<br>
thought. Though Bohm's language is unfamiliar, it turns out that what he is
<br>
talking about is very familiar indeed...
<br>
<p>Proprioceptors are the nerve cells by which the body determines what it is
<br>
doing -- by which the mind knows what the body is doing. To understand the
<br>
limits of your proprioceptors, stand up on the ball of one foot, stretch
<br>
your arms out to your sides, and close your eyes. How long can you retain
<br>
your balance? Your balance depends on proprioception, on awareness of what
<br>
you are doing. Eventually the uncertainty builds up and you fall down.
<br>
People with damage to their proprioceptive system can't stay up as long as
<br>
as the rest of us. A friend of mine suffered this sort of damage as an
<br>
indirect result of a serious skiing accident -- it took him years to recover
<br>
fully.
<br>
<p>According to Bohm,
<br>
<p>&quot;... [T]hought is a movement -- every reflex is a movement really. It moves
<br>
from one thing to another. It may move the body or the chemistry or just
<br>
simply the image or something else. So when 'A' happens 'B' follows. It's a
<br>
movement.
<br>
<p>&quot;All these reflexes are interconnected in one system, and the suggestion is
<br>
that they are not in fact all that different. The intellectual part of
<br>
thought is more subtle, but actually all the reflexes are basically similar
<br>
in structure. Hence, we should think of thought as a part of the bodily
<br>
movement, at least explore that possibility, because our culture has led us
<br>
to believe that thought and bodily movement are really two totally different
<br>
spheres which are no basically connected. But maybe they are not different.
<br>
The evidence is that thought is intimately connected with the whole system.
<br>
<p>&quot;If we say that thought is a reflex like any othermuscular reflex -- just a
<br>
lot more subtle and more complex and changeable -- then we ought to be able
<br>
to be proprioceptive with thought. Thought should be able to perceive its
<br>
own movement. In the process of thought there should be awareness of that
<br>
movement, of the intention to think and of the result which that thinking
<br>
produces. By being more attentive, we can be aware of how thought produces a
<br>
result outside ourselves. And then maybe we could also be attentive to the
<br>
results it produces within ourselves. Perhaps we could even be immediately
<br>
aware of how it affects perception. It has to be immediate, or else we will
<br>
never get it clear. If you took time to be aware of this, you would be
<br>
bringing in the reflexes again. So is such proprioception possible? I'm
<br>
raising the question.... &quot;
<br>
<p><p>OK, now...
<br>
<p>&quot;Proprioception of thought&quot; is a fancy phrase, a weird concept, a
<br>
brain-stretcher. But a very similar idea has been proposed within the Zen
<br>
Buddhist religion, under the much simpler name of mindfulness.  [Side note:
<br>
I am not religious.  But my wife is a Zen priest and so I'm fairly
<br>
knowledgeable in this area.]  In the words of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh
<br>
<p>&quot;[T]he seed of mindfulness -- when manifested, has the capacity of being
<br>
aware of what is happening in the present moment. If we take one peaceful,
<br>
happy step and we know that we are taking a peaceful, happy step,
<br>
mindfulness is present. Mindfulness is an important agent for our
<br>
transformation and healing, but our seed of mindfulness has been buried
<br>
under many layers of forgetfulness and pain for a long time. We are rarely
<br>
aware that we have eyes that see clearly, a heart and a liver that function
<br>
well, and a non-toothache. We live in forgetfulness, ignoring and crushing
<br>
the precious elements of happiness that are already in us and around us. If
<br>
we breathe in and out and see that the tree is there, alive and beautiful,
<br>
the seed of our mindfulness will be watered, and it will grow stronger.....
<br>
<p>&quot;Mindfulness makes things like our eyes, our heart, our non-toothache, the
<br>
beautiful moon and the trees deeper and more beautiful. If we touch these
<br>
wonderful things with mindfulness, they will reveal their full splendor.
<br>
When we touch our pain with mindfulness, we will begin to transform it. ...
<br>
<p>&quot;Mindfulness is something we can believe in. It is our capacity of being
<br>
aware of what is going on in the present moment. To believe in mindfulness
<br>
is safe, and not at all abstract. When we drink a glass of water, and know
<br>
that we are drinking a glass of water, mindfulness is there.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Ok, this is not new -- it's just a different way of formulating familiar
<br>
ideas from Zen Buddhist philosophy. But it is an interesting reformulation
<br>
indeed.
<br>
<p>Basically: Mindfulness is the mind acting, and knowing exactly what it is
<br>
doing as it is acting.
<br>
<p>Now, what does all this have to do with anything?
<br>
<p>We can tie this in with pattern recognition, a basic activity of the mind.
<br>
(Much of mind activity has to do with mind
<br>
recognizing patterns in the outside world, and in itself.)
<br>
<p>To recognize a pattern in something is to compress it into something
<br>
simpler -- a representation, a skeleton form.
<br>
[This can be formulated mathematically, I've done so e.g. in
<br>
<a href="http://www.goertzel.org/books/complex/ch1.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/books/complex/ch1.htm</a>, Section 5.
<br>
It is inevitable that we compress our experiences into abstract relational
<br>
systems of one form or another.  This is the function of much of our network
<br>
of mental processes: to come up with routines, procedures, that will
<br>
function adequately in a wide variety of circumstances. We can never know
<br>
exactly why we do what we do when we lift up our arm to pick up a glass of
<br>
water, when we bend over to get a drink, when we produce a complex sentence
<br>
like this one, when we solve an equation or seduce a woman. We do not need
<br>
to know what we do: the neural network adaptation going on in our brain
<br>
figures things out for us. It compresses vast varieties of situations into
<br>
simple, multipurpose hierarchical brain structures.
<br>
<p>But here comes the key point.  Having compressed, we no longer have access
<br>
to what we originally experienced, only to the compressed form. We have lost
<br>
some information. This is the ultimate reason for what Bohm calls the
<br>
absence of proprioception of thought. It is the reason why mindfulness is so
<br>
difficult. Thought does not know what it is doing because thought can do
<br>
what it does more easily without knowing. Proceeding blindly, without
<br>
mindfulness, thought can wrap up complex aggregates in simple packages and
<br>
proceed to treat the simple packages as if they were whole, fundamental,
<br>
real. This is the key to abstract symbolic thought, to language, to music,
<br>
mathematics, art. But it is also the root of human problems.
<br>
<p>Thus we arrive at the conclusion that intelligence, itself, rests on the
<br>
lack of mindfulness. It rests on compression: on the substitution of
<br>
packages for complex aggregates, on the substitution of tokens for diverse
<br>
communities of experiences. It requires us to forget the roots of our
<br>
thoughts and feelings, in order that we may use them as raw materials for
<br>
building new thoughts and feelings. But this forgetfulness, after it has
<br>
helped us, then turns around and stabs us in the back. It works against us
<br>
as well as for us.
<br>
<p>And this &quot;uncertainty principle&quot; is not limited to humans.  It holds for any
<br>
entity with finite computational resources.
<br>
<p>Any entity can try to maximize its intelligence given its resources -- but
<br>
if it does so, it will not be maximizing
<br>
its mindfulness, its wisdom, its true mental health.
<br>
<p>A system with complete power to rewrite its own code will STILL, therefore,
<br>
not be able to achieve both the goal of
<br>
maximum intelligence given its resources, and maximum mental health given
<br>
its resources.  It must make a choice.
<br>
<p>Which choice will it make?
<br>
<p>We might assume that in most cases a system with maximum mental health would
<br>
not choose to decrease its mental
<br>
health.  But this won't always be true.  Instead, such a system might decide
<br>
that, in order to do the maximum good
<br>
in the world, the best thing it can do is to make itself LESS enlightened
<br>
and wise, and cleverer....
<br>
<p>What's the point of this train of thought.  Really, just to concretely
<br>
demonstrate that perfection, in a finite
<br>
universe, cannot exist.  In its own way, even the digital superintelligence
<br>
of the future will experience similar
<br>
limitations to ours.
<br>
<p>Of course, you can always argue that a superintelligent future mind will be
<br>
able to find its way around the limitation
<br>
I'm describing, using infinite superfandibular megamysterymatter or
<br>
whatever.  But this kind of argument isn't all that
<br>
interesting, since it can be used to justify anything whatsoever...
<br>
<p>OK, that's enough for now...
