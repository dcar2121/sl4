<em>&gt; Technology will make it possible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wishes (in theory) to be as smart and capable as they wish to be (given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewiring and augmentation and time enough).
</em><br>
<p>And money enough?  There's the rub, eh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The notion that ownership equals or contributes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleanliness is extremely arguable.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm....  The national parks are pretty clean....  And there are plenty of
<br>
privately owned
<br>
toxic sludge swamps within 10 miles of where I live in jersey city....  But
<br>
I guess technically
<br>
speaking the point is ~arguable~ ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This simplistic and uncompassionate philosophy is in the author's head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than in the minds of many people I know.  The author seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associate everything bad with that great dirty word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;libertarianism&quot;.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is quite childish and transparently biased.
</em><br>
<p><p>As I said already, I accept that everyone has their own individual views...
<br>
nevertheless
<br>
the Extropian texts on the Web present a certain particular [overtly
<br>
Libertarian] point of view,
<br>
as do the books and interviews I was citing and critiquing in that
<br>
article...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There are fairly deep questions involved in what is and is not proper (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually leads to good results) concerning (relatively) poor.  Far from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being cavalier many of us seem to have strong motivations towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long hours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hard work toward a future where most of the idiocies and sufferings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today can actually be resolved.  The author seems to be caught in a static
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model of the wealth and the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, &quot;in the long run we'll all be dead.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't doubt that in 500 years the subjective universe of our descendants
<br>
will be astoundingly
<br>
different -- and hopefully even more interesting!
<br>
<p>What worries me are the kids around the world getting fucked over by the
<br>
CURRENT state of things.
<br>
The coolness of 2500 AD, or even 2050 AD, is not terribly relevant to them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarians say that charity at gunpoint is immoral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samantha:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By most definitions of morals it *is* immoral.
</em><br>
<p>No, by most definitions of morals, as standardly interpreted, government and
<br>
taxation
<br>
is NOT immoral, sorry.
<br>
<p>This is just a false statistical statement.
<br>
<p>The standard moral codes come from the standard religions, none of which
<br>
were
<br>
particularly anti-statist.
<br>
<p>I am not religious nor do I necessarily think standard moral codes are
<br>
correct, but,
<br>
these are the facts
<br>
<p><em>&gt; samantha:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Although poverty is partially a relative thing.  I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative differences are necessarily bad in and of themselves.
</em><br>
<p>This is true enough in the abstract, but it is also spoken like one who has
<br>
never had anything to do with poverty in real life...
<br>
<p>In other words: To the extent that poverty ~is~ in the mind, it is still a
<br>
bad thing.
<br>
And we can't discount the relation between the mental and the material.
<br>
<p>Few in the US are truly starving or in physical poverty, as one finds in
<br>
other nations.
<br>
Yet the &quot;poverty mentality&quot; drags down millions of new kids in our country
<br>
each year, into lives
<br>
of violence and destructive drug use ... while
<br>
we work toward providing their great-grandchildren with digital salvation ;&gt;
