strongly agree.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Who knows, Davies may turn out to be right; but even so, this strikes me
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; heavier-than-air flight.  &quot;Despite numerous demonstrations that their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Physicists of our time are generally are much less willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismiss things out of hand (alarming notion!=physical impossibility).
</em><br>
<p>I see physicists of our time using their &quot;alarming notion&quot; indicator
<br>
predictively; e.g., they are saying that because certain things alarm
<br>
physicists, they must alarm the Universe as well.  If a naked singularity
<br>
is possible, then there must be some kind of effect that rules out the
<br>
formation, and so on.  They then go looking for the effect.  Sometimes
<br>
this works, in which case I have no objection.  Certainly, faced with a
<br>
classical-physics proposal for perpetual motion, I would start with my
<br>
preconceived notion that classical perpetual motion is impossible, and
<br>
work backwards from there.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, however, it is quite possible that - however alarming a naked
<br>
singularity is to physicists - there will simply *be* naked singularities
<br>
anyway.  Some physicists seem to be crossing the line between a valuable
<br>
heuristic, which is one thing, and a state of mind in which there is no
<br>
longer any value in going and looking for naked singularities or trying to
<br>
build them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I must take issue with the analogies you make here, especially as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are either glossing over, or overlooking things which make these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different kinds of &quot;barriers&quot;, rather than different magnitudes. The sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; barrier/heavier than air arguement is oft quoted w.r.t. travel at speeds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater than c (tantamount to time travel, which I'll come to).
</em><br>
<p>Please note that *nowhere* do I make the comparision between
<br>
faster-than-sound and FTL; believe me, I find the comparision as odious as
<br>
you do.  FTL is not a speed limit.  It is built into the structure of
<br>
causality.  You cannot go faster than light, globally, except by warping
<br>
space so that you are still travelling slower than light, locally.  And
<br>
you cannot warp space without permitting time travel.  Now, it so happens
<br>
that I think time travel is possible.  But to actually go faster than
<br>
light would require outright magic.
<br>
<p>The &quot;local FTL&quot; limit is imposed by the Universe itself.  The Universe
<br>
speaks to us, and it defines causality in a way that is counterintuitive;
<br>
it says that there is no space of simultaneity, and that the structure of
<br>
causality rules out FTL.  This was an alarming notion to the physicists of
<br>
the time - though it doesn't alarm me at all, since I grew up decades
<br>
later.  What we have now is the Universe speaking through General
<br>
Relativity, saying that a single correct direction of time is prohibited;
<br>
we have numerous descriptions of systems which may be impossible to
<br>
*construct*, such as wormholes, but which still contain internally
<br>
consistent CTCs, and we have a bunch of physicists calling closed timelike
<br>
curves an &quot;alarming notion&quot;.  I agree that the notion of killing your own
<br>
grandfather alarms physicists, but we have absolutely no experimental
<br>
reason to believe that the notion alarms the Universe.  It conflicts with
<br>
our notions of causality, but our notions of causality are demonstrably
<br>
not the same notions of causality possessed by the Universe.  So when I
<br>
hear someone calling a closed timelike curve an &quot;alarming notion&quot;, it
<br>
sounds to me like a very shaky assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical theory said faster than sound flight was *physically* impossible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a theory which says faster than light travel is physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible though (Relativity, both general and special). Though there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some (theoretical, not observed) metrics which appear to violate this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; locally, globally flat space time is a pretty good approximation.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that assuming what you want to prove?  Let's say that you construct
<br>
a wormhole between Sol and Proxima Centauri; space is then no longer
<br>
globally flat.  It might be better to say that astronomical observations
<br>
show no evidence that the metric of spacetime in other galaxies, to the
<br>
limits of observation, differs from the observed local metric - but that
<br>
says nothing about whether one solar system contains a time machine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Flat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space time is special relativity(SR), and whatever way you write it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however you do it, globally SR has never been violated and there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical way to violate it either - QM obeys it, even including EPR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradoxes and mesoscopic systems.
</em><br>
<p>What is the speed of propagation of state-vector reduction?  Never mind;
<br>
the refusal of most physicists to think about state-vector reduction as a
<br>
real physical phenomenon, rather than a philosophical or observational
<br>
one, is a totally different blind spot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         So - in contrast to the vague reasons given for the limits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human technology as regards supersonic flight, reliable(*) physical theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has given us concrete physical limits to our universe, as we understand it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now. There is no loophole without an effect that has yet to be discovered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me say that again another way: though we may construct theories that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't disallow certain things (eg: time travel) these theories do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belong to the minimal consistent set of physical theories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt; (*) aside: how reliable is SR? How many tests of SR do we do each day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that CERN / SLAC / FermiLab run? Millions? How many times has SR been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong? Never. Would we see it if it was wrong just once? Oh yes!&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, I do not dispute Special Relativity.  I do not ever expect to see
<br>
Special Relativity violated.  The reason I do not believe in Greg Bear's
<br>
speculations about &quot;descriptor theory&quot; is that it would require a global
<br>
space of simultaneity, which is Just Not Allowed.  I &quot;get&quot; Special
<br>
Relativity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Time travel: We need accept only one of: universal flat space time,
</em><br>
<p>Isn't that sort of like a single space of simultaneity?  Spacetime is
<br>
*locally* flat (no naked singularities, please!).  Globally, the
<br>
lightcones point in all kinds of different directions, and you can pick
<br>
any individual light cone and declare it to be This Side Up; the rest will
<br>
rotate into place while preserving all observed physical laws, just as
<br>
Special Relativity says you can pick any space of simultaneity you like. 
<br>
The spirit of General Relativity - as *opposed* to our untrustworthy
<br>
intuitions about causality - mediates as strongly against declaring a
<br>
particular, &quot;objectively&quot; correct direction of causality, as Special
<br>
Relativity mediates against an objective space of simultaneity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; upper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speed limit for information transfer=c,
</em><br>
<p>Locally?  Sure.  Globally?  Another question entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or causality,
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;causality&quot;, I presume you mean the set of intuitions about cause and
<br>
effect that have evolved to be present within the mind of the theorizing
<br>
physicists?  One can hardly advocate that such intuitions be sovereign
<br>
over experiment, or even over the particular predictions of current
<br>
theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; to run into immense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficulties constructing a theory which allows time travel. In fact, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out accepting causality we run into immense problems constructing any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical theory.
</em><br>
<p>*This* is the blind spot.  I don't believe in what you call &quot;causality&quot;. 
<br>
I think that when you say &quot;causality&quot;, you are referring to a set of
<br>
preconceptions which will eventually be disproved by the experimental
<br>
construction of a closed timelike curve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; theories permitted the possibility of time travel / negative energy /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; naked singularities etc., twentieth-century physicists still refused to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe, calling them 'alarming notions'.&quot;  This rant is more about time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; travel then about thermodynamics, but real physical laws don't look like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they're about to be violated every second Tuesday.  Sometimes physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thermodynamics is something you should be concerned with. Locally, at

</em><br>

<em>&gt; arranged matter, than one would have thought we're going to need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to understand the transistion phase from quantum to statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics as the best modelled physical analogue we have.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  If the functional elements of an intelligence do not depend
<br>
on details of the quantum-mechanical level, an understanding of the
<br>
transition phase is not practically necessary to constructing
<br>
intelligence.  To the extent that the functional elements of intelligence
<br>
do not depend on details which are *only* achievable at the
<br>
quantum-mechanical level, understanding of physics is not theoretically
<br>
necessary to constructing intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;permissible fluctuations in entropy&quot;, but did you ever hear of a

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vacuum pair creation, on short time scales.
</em><br>
<p>I stand corrected, then; you can get away with it for sufficiently small
<br>
values of delta t.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If current physical theory offends a physicist, so what?  God does play
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dice with the Universe, Einstein, get over it.  Even the more imaginative
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Physicists must work in science fact, not fiction. For example, we have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; dimensional donut because it lets us do something we'd really like to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (eat donuts), but all that means nothing if we don't have physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for the theory.
</em><br>
<p>GUTs are epicycles.  GUTs are another pet peeve of mine.  Who moved these
<br>
people's cheese?  Why are they wasting time - I won't say &quot;wasting money&quot;,
<br>
since &quot;a physicist's salary is never wasted&quot;, but why are they wasting the
<br>
far more precious resource of physicists' time - on searching for
<br>
particles?  We will see no new interesting theories and no new interesting
<br>
technology as a result of applying the reductionistic paradigm that took
<br>
us down to the quark level, because that is no longer where the real
<br>
questions are.  GUTs throw hugely increasing amounts of complexity in
<br>
exchange for vanishingly small returns of prediction, and this should be
<br>
enough to tell us that GUTs are on the wrong track.
<br>
<p>I, Eliezer Yudkowsky, being of sound mind, do make this testable
<br>
prediction:  The next major discovery in physics - if there are any major
<br>
advances in physics pre-Singularity - will be on the order of the
<br>
Michelson-Morley experiment, and it will occur when somebody constructs a
<br>
simple, obvious in retrospect, and relatively cheap experiment that
<br>
distinguishes when state-vector reduction occurs in a system.  The next
<br>
major discovery will not be in the tenth decimal place; it will cover one
<br>
of the huge, gaping holes in our current description of the Universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, it isn't. GR must obey SR over large enough distances
</em><br>
<p>That is not something I've ever heard.  Why?
<br>
<p>If true, it would seem to completely rule out constructs such as wormholes
<br>
and Tipler cylinders, which may be impossible to *construct* due to Cosmic
<br>
Censorship, but which do have descriptions that appear *internally*
<br>
consistent under current physical law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sorry, but that is faulty reasoning. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did understand GR completely (which you don't), you still would have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to say &quot;Ah, but we can do this in our model (if we push all our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paremeters to one corner of the phase space) therefore we can do this in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality&quot;. In addition, you are attempting to use a technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (mathematical constructs around GR) to fault the apparent narrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mindedness of physicists who use and develop that technology as their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool. To do that, you better be on a very firm foundation - and it's clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, never mind.  I'm not a physicist.  You can get personally annoyed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical theories, but you're supposed to buy the right to do so with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physics doctorate.  This system works so well generally that I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no real objection to being slapped down by it personally.  Not my job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;/RANT&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I like this though ;-)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I thought you would.
<br>
<p>One of the ways that I can prevent conflicts with accepted contemporary
<br>
theory is by making sure that at least one physicist agrees with me about
<br>
any particular point.  That modern physicists have a &quot;blind spot&quot; about
<br>
time travel is my own, causal interpretation of a reason why they make
<br>
certain statements, but it is also a fact that a significant minority of
<br>
physicists do think that time travel is possible; I thus have a reasonable
<br>
expectation that I am not making an absurd statement when I say that time
<br>
travel is not prohibited by current physical law.  Similarly, when I say
<br>
that state-vector reduction is a real physical event and not an observer
<br>
effect or a philosophical way of describing a system, I am agreeing with,
<br>
e.g., Sir Roger Penrose, which doesn't mean that I am necessarily right,
<br>
but it does hopefully mean that I am not making a statement in material
<br>
conflict with existing physics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can't just say that, since there are no observational consequences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the many worlds model. You are ruling something out in almost the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I'd rule out the class of GR metrics that allow time travel, except one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senario has testable experimental consequences, the other doesn't ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interpretation of QM is philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not.  A system in which state-vector reduction, e.g. a
<br>
measurement, occurs, evolves differently than a system in which no
<br>
measurement occurs.  That's the basic &quot;paradox&quot; (thing our intuitions
<br>
don't like) about quantum theory; if you measure which slit a photon
<br>
passes through, it will wind up in a different place, not because of
<br>
Heisenberg or anything, but because superposed states can cancel out as
<br>
well as adding up.  A many-worlds theory states that no superposed state
<br>
ever dies, and we simply wind up in a randomly selected one of them.  If
<br>
so, why can we correctly make the prediction that certain superposed
<br>
states will cancel out?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; quantum collapse were an observational-effect illusion, it would make no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difference what the probability amplitudes were; we would have the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observed chance of winding up in a .2 probability Universe as a .8
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, the probabilities would still be different.
</em><br>
<p>If all the superposed states exist and no quantum collapse occurs, so that
<br>
a .2 amplitude and a .8 amplitude exist equally, with the world branching
<br>
to go both ways, then why do we, the observer, make the prediction that we
<br>
have a .64 probability of appearing to go down the first branch and only a
<br>
.04 probability of going down the second branch?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hmmm.. I've gone on rather longer than I'd hoped, but the points I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempted to make are these:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one is going to use physical theories for some thing concrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ie: predictive) then use the theory correctly - don't use a theory for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy, use it to calculate, that is what it is there for. Entropy is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely defined quantity for example (but be aware of the tacit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions made in defining a quantity).
</em><br>
<p>Entropy is observer relative; that is, depending on how much information
<br>
an external system has about an internal system, the apparent &quot;entropy&quot; of
<br>
that system may change.  There are some precisely defined properties, like
<br>
&quot;space&quot; or &quot;time&quot;, that are not observer-independent - but &quot;entropy&quot;
<br>
depends on the observer's state of mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;         If one is going to speculate about science fiction (a possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect which hasn't been observed yet, that would have &quot;scientific&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reprecussions) then speculate, but don't do it within the framework of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general consensus, since those theories were formulated to explain only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed effects. Certainly one shouldn't use the fact that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation of an individual theory allows something to conclude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that something exists... minimise your assumptions.
</em><br>
<p>In essence, what I am doing is not - from my own twisted perspective -
<br>
speculating; rather, I am calling attention to the totally unjustified
<br>
speculation of many current physicists that &quot;closed timelike curves&quot; are
<br>
hated by the Universe.  In fact, it was *in* science fiction that I first
<br>
found the speculation that the Universe hates a paradox - but we have *no*
<br>
justification for this!  It is something that would be convenient for
<br>
physicists if true, but nobody has any idea whether it's true!  The
<br>
Universe may indeed *turn out* to hate closed timelike curves, but I see
<br>
nothing that allows us to conclude this from current evidence.  I do not,
<br>
Ifni forbid, insist that - for example - Special Relativity be modified to
<br>
permit local FTL.  I do, however, get disturbed when I hear a physicist
<br>
objecting to an innocent theory on the grounds that it would permit
<br>
&quot;closed timelike curves&quot;; this person is making an assumption which has
<br>
not been justified.  Calling it a &quot;consequence of the logical definition
<br>
of causality&quot; horrifies me.  It sounds like a reversion to Plato.  A
<br>
logical definition proves nothing.
