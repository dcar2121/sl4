<p>No, you wouldn't go insane, or at least no more so than most people are
<br>
already.
<br>
<p>The same questions have been asked about various new inventions of
<br>
humankind. It is far more likely that new challenges and interest will
<br>
occur as rich or richer than pre-upload.  ET may not be interested in
<br>
talking to relative primitives but I doubt they have no external needs
<br>
at all.  Someone has to keep the computational matrix running.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also have been seeing some TV shows about geological events in human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history that sound like a Junior extinction event. One possibility it that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the area around Yellow Stone national park errupts, then the bio world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes bigtime because of lack of sunlight.  Now, like in Diaspora, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue was cosmic and gamma rays hitting life like a hammer; I wonder if even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nano-tube networks could get messed-up, even though they are more resilient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether meat or carbo-silicate life, we need to not put our eggs in one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basket, and we must stay plugged into reality somehow. A chore in itself.
</em><br>
<p>If the Yellowstone super-caldera erupts most everyone within oh, 500
<br>
miles or so,  dies with long-term major overcast for quite some time. 
<br>
It would not be a &quot;minor&quot; event.
