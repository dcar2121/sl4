hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've often heard that tolerance has something to do with creativity, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that this is a myth that gets repeated because it's a socially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable thing to say.  I think that intolerance, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-intolerance, of even the least little compromise of thought quality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the way by which we make qualitative improvements in our personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophies.  I think it's intolerance that leads us to make major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes in ourselves, and tolerance of imperfection which leads to staying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where you are, possibly making slight improvements every now and then, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing drastic; not really going anywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the really creative people tend to be totally intolerant of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperfection within themselves, and this leads them to be intolerant of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperfections caused by others.  This is not the politic attitude to take,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps - and indeed, what I've described is a strictly internal attitude,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying nothing about external speech.  But whenever I see a genuinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative person advocating tolerance and openness as an aid towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;brainstorming&quot;, my first impulse is to think &quot;meme infection&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I am speaking from personal experience, not repeating what I've heard or
<br>
read.
<br>
<p>The point is that no one's judgment is perfect, and if one suspends one's
<br>
inclination
<br>
to reject what one finds senseless, a certain percentage of the time one
<br>
will later
<br>
find that it actually wasn't so senseless after all....
<br>
<p>Of course, one can't accept EVERYTHING indiscriminately, but often, one is
<br>
wisest to
<br>
somewhat temper one's instinctive intolerance and give things that seem
<br>
worthless the
<br>
benefit of the doubt...
<br>
<p>I think this perspective has been particularly useful to me because my
<br>
instinct is to
<br>
judge a LOT of things worthless...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Noise and chaos, yes - but *quality* noise and chaos.  Not all noise and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chaos are useful just because they can be described by the &quot;noise&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;chaos&quot; category labels.
</em><br>
<p>Here we just disagree, but this is no longer a discussion about the list,
<br>
it's
<br>
about philosophy of mind.
<br>
<p>&quot;Quality noise&quot; is almost an oxymoron that defeats the concept of &quot;noise&quot; --
<br>
though
<br>
not totally ... I guess that a string of random 0's and 1'st posted to the
<br>
list wouldn't
<br>
enhance creativity that much (unless it was decoded into some more
<br>
interesting form)....
<br>
<p>My point is that a certain nonzero percentage of things that seem off-topic
<br>
actually can
<br>
enhance discussion of a given topic...
