<em>&gt; I've become confused. What do you mean by a 'shaping force' in this context?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it evolution? Is it social organization? Something else?
</em><br>
<p>A &quot;shaping force&quot; - I think of them as &quot;shapers&quot; - is a source of pattern. 
<br>
Evolution is *the* method by which patterns are transferred into the human
<br>
genome, but sometimes that complexity is copied from specific selection
<br>
pressures, or specific frequently-encountered scenarios that create specific
<br>
selection pressures.  Sometimes details of how evolution occurs - differential
<br>
rates of reproduction, kin selection, and so on - combine with specific
<br>
scenarios to yield patterns that are the product of both shapers.
<br>
<p>Okay, this is getting too abstract.  Let's say that I need to go to sleep
<br>
because I have certain brain hardware which shuts me down every 16 hours,
<br>
hardware which exists because of a selection pressure based on the
<br>
differential design utility of sleeping to regenerate the brain and immune
<br>
system and, well, whatever the heck sleep does that's so important, and synced
<br>
to the pattern of daylight and darkness caused by Earth's rotational period. 
<br>
That is, the 24-hour period was copied from the Earth-rotation shaper, and the
<br>
proper source of such pattern is the rotation period, rather than magic
<br>
numbers derived from complexity inherent in the process of evolution itself.
<br>
<p>If we wanted to know what life would be like on a planet with a 36-hour
<br>
rotational period, we would mentally do a causal rewrite: alter the key shaper
<br>
in the causal chain - in this case, the rotational period - and then rerun the
<br>
causal model forwards in time, which in this case involves a more-or-less
<br>
direct pattern copy from the rotational period to the sleep cycle length,
<br>
outputting the final pattern of a 36-hour sleep cycle - the way things &quot;would
<br>
have been&quot; if the Earth had had a 36-hour rotational period.
<br>
<p>(Yes, I know humans actually adopt 25-and-some sleep cycles if shut off from
<br>
external light-cycle inputs.  I didn't have time to think of a simple example
<br>
that was actually simple instead of simplified.)
<br>
<p>So when I say that you can't reason from biology, what I mean is that the
<br>
post-Singularity future has a different set of shapers from our own world, and
<br>
that you need to deprecate shapers that look specifically biological as the
<br>
default assumption (i.e., until somebody comes up with a good source for that
<br>
shaper in that scenario), a precautionary heuristic adopted because futurists
<br>
have a known tendency to anthropomorphize.
<br>
<p>And now, since I am actually becoming dizzy due to lack of sleep:
<br>
Good night!
