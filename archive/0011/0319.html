<p>Well, there was a point where I knew what a partial differential equation
<br>
was and could even solve some of the simpler ones, but I'm not even sure I
<br>
could recognize one anymore.  Beginner's calculus remains mine forever,
<br>
though - enough for me to read an allegedly mathematical psychology paper
<br>
and decode some impressive-looking equation as actually meaning &quot;A affects
<br>
B in some way&quot;.  The most advanced course I've taken so far was a college
<br>
course at Northwestern University on linear algebra, where I was fortunate
<br>
enough to get a teacher who'd I'd actually heard of previously... I'm
<br>
afraid that not much of that has stayed with me either, though.
<br>
<p>I am sure you will be dismayed but not surprised to learn that every
<br>
single bit of formal mathematical training I have ever received has been
<br>
focused on continuous variables, with a few very minor detours into
<br>
geometry, rings versus fields, and so on.  In fact, I already knew about
<br>
fractions when my first-grade math teacher tried to get me to say &quot;two,
<br>
remainder one&quot;, like it said in the textbook, instead of &quot;two point
<br>
five&quot;.  (I refused, of course.)  Perhaps this has given me a bad
<br>
impression, but I did once try reading a book on computer-science
<br>
mathematics - &quot;Concrete Mathematics&quot; (by Knuth, of course) - and what I
<br>
saw there was amazingly awkward, confirming completely my initial
<br>
impression that mathematics was simply not an appropriate description for
<br>
computational systems.
<br>
<p>If-then-else - not just the specific token-level IFJMP, but higher-level
<br>
processes with major transitions of an if-then-else nature - are poison to
<br>
mathematical descriptions.  To be specific, complex structures built from
<br>
if-then-else components, or from if-then-else operations acting to return
<br>
different *structures* instead of different atomic elements, usually
<br>
render any attempt at mathematical description completely useless.  Not
<br>
impossible, but &quot;useless&quot;, because even if you come up with a description,
<br>
it takes a form which cannot be analyzed using any of the mathematical
<br>
tools you have available.
<br>
<p>When you have a programmatic function that returns a smooth curve as a
<br>
function of input, you can apply all kinds of tools.  As soon as you, for
<br>
some reason, hack that function to return -3 if the input is between 4.5
<br>
and 5.5, the only way to amend the mathematical description is by
<br>
incorporating incredibly awkward mathematical symbols that say, verbatim,
<br>
&quot;except that this function returns -3 if the input is between 4.5 and
<br>
5.5&quot;.  The function would be easier to think about if you just scrawled
<br>
that note in English.  If you were building any higher mental structures
<br>
of mathematics from the smooth function you started out with, those
<br>
structures are permanently wrecked; this is what I mean when I say a
<br>
mathematical description would be &quot;useless&quot;, although you can sometimes
<br>
get one if you're willing to torture the notation by adding in every
<br>
single if-then-else element separately.
<br>
<p>Programming - thinking about structures with if-then-else nature - is
<br>
*not* more (or less!) &quot;artistic&quot; than mathematics, but it does use a
<br>
different kind of thinking.
