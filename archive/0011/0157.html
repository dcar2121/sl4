This article is in reference to Ben Goertzel's FAZ article about Extropianism,
<br>
&quot;The Extropian Creed&quot;, which may be found online and in English at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/extropians.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/benzine/extropians.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This group [...] wants to push ahead with every kind of technology as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast as possible – the Internet, body modification, human-computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synthesis, nanotechnology, genetic modification, cryogenics, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name it.  Along the way they want to get rid of governments, moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictures, and eventually humanity itself, remaking the world as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypereconomic virtual reality system in which money and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology control everything.  Their utopian vision is sketchy but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fabulous:  a kind of Neuromancer-ish, Social-Darwinist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Silicon-Valley-to-the-n’th-degree of the collective soul. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it's arguable whether we all like all of the technologies.  For
<br>
example, I feel that genetic modification has too slow a turnaround time to
<br>
have any appreciable effect on our future, and I have misgivings about
<br>
nanotechnology; some other Extropians dislike AI.  My main objection, however,
<br>
is to the part about Social Darwinism, which I feel is neither intrinsically
<br>
Extropian nor even intrinsically Libertarian.  Social Darwinism certainly runs
<br>
diametrically counter to my own philosophy.
<br>
<p>What Ben means specifically by &quot;Social Darwinism&quot; appears in the following
<br>
passages, which everyone else on SL4 should bear in mind are taken TOTALLY OUT
<br>
OF CONTEXT - the rest of the writing is a fairminded intro to Extropy, with
<br>
Social Darwinism being the one particular note that Ben Goertzel sees as
<br>
disturbing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there was a painful contradiction lurking here, not far beneath
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the surface.  And this personal contradiction, I believe, cuts right at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the heart of Extropian philosophy.  The libertarian strain in Sasha’s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking was highly pronounced: Once he told me, tongue only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halfway in cheek, that he thought air should be metered out for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price, and that those who didn’t have the money to pay for their air
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be left to suffocate!   I later learned this was a variation on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard libertarian argument, often repeated by Max More, to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect that the reason the air was polluted was that nobody owned it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; – ergo, air, like everything else, should be private property.
</em><br>
<p>[MUCH LATER:]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the back of my mind is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision of a far-future hyper-technological Holocaust, in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cyborg despots dispense air at fifty dollars per cubic meter, citing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn-of-the-millenium Extropian writings to the effect that humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to go obsolete anyway, so it doesn’t make much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference whether we kill them off now or not.   And so, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians should be read, because they’ve thought about some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspects of our future more thoroughly than just about anyone else. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I also think that the key idea that makes their group unique --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the alliance of transhuman technology with simplistic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncompassionate libertarian philosophy – must be opposed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great vigor.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Many of the freedoms the Extropians seek – the legal freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make and take smart drugs, to modify the body and the genome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with advanced technology – will probably come soon (though not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon enough for me, or them).  But I hope that these freedoms will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not come along with a cavalier disregard for those living in less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fortunate economic conditions, who may not be able to afford the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latest in phosphorescent terabit cranial jacks or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum-computing-powered virtual reality doodaddles, or even an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adequately nutritional diet for their children.  I believe that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, for all our greed and weakness, have a compassionate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; core, and I hope and expect that this aspect of our humanity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry over into the digital age – even into the transhuman age,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outliving the human body in its present form.  I love the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warmth and teeming mental diversity of important thinkers like Max
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More, Hans  Moravec, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Sasha Chislenko,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and great thinkers like Nietzsche – and I hope and expect that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities will outlast the more simplistic, ambiguity-fearing aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their philosophies.  Well aware of the typically human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictoriness that this entails, I’m looking forward to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of a cyberphilosophy beyond Extropianism -- a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanist transhumanism.

<p>==
<br>
<p>The fundamental argument of Libertarianism is not against charity; rather, the
<br>
argument of Libertarianism is against government-compelled charity.  There is
<br>
nothing immoral about a privately owned charity; rather, the Libertarian
<br>
objection is to charity funded by compulsorily collected taxation.  Some
<br>
Libertarians say that charity at gunpoint is immoral.  Others simply believe
<br>
that just about everything is less efficient when the government operates it -
<br>
that the money that is taxed away for forced charity is spent inefficiently,
<br>
debilitates the economy, and often does so much direct damage that the poor
<br>
would be better off if the government simply set fire to the money.  There may
<br>
be Libertarians who don't give a damn about the poor, but not many, and
<br>
probably no higher a proportion than among the general populace.
<br>
<p>I am a Libertarian because I have a heuristic - a heuristic derived from
<br>
examination of history - which says that involving the government makes
<br>
matters even worse.  I object to government-compelled and
<br>
government-administrated charity on the grounds that it just doesn't work.  I
<br>
do not object to private charities.  I do *not* believe in any form of Social
<br>
Darwinism.  As far as I'm concerned, every human being, rich or poor,
<br>
constitutes one six-billionth of the total moral value of the Solar System.
<br>
<p>I do not believe there is any action you can take, however evil or stupid,
<br>
which can cause you to &quot;deserve&quot; pain or death or poverty or even stupidity. 
<br>
Nonconsensual pain is a moral wrong, a negatively valued goal, and nothing can
<br>
ever flip that sign to a positive.  At this particular moment in time - as
<br>
opposed to after the Singularity - we have no better way to protect the
<br>
integrity of society than with forms of retaliation such as imprisonment or
<br>
shooting a mugger.  Taking evil actions makes someone more &quot;targetable&quot; for
<br>
ills, so that if *someone* has to be hurt, we should prefer that the mugger be
<br>
hurt, than that his victim be hurt.  That doesn't make the hurt a good thing.
<br>
<p>I don't believe that, if you're poor, that makes ills that occur to you
<br>
desirable.  I don't believe that being poor makes you &quot;targetable&quot; for
<br>
anything.  I don't believe that it is morally better in any way if bad things
<br>
happen to poor people instead of rich people.  I don't believe that society is
<br>
healthier when bad things happen to poor people.  I don't believe that poor
<br>
people deserve poverty.  I am not a Social Darwinist of any kind.
<br>
<p>I also don't believe that the poor will be left out of the Singularity.  I
<br>
think that the successful seed AI will blaze straight to strong transhumanity
<br>
and superintelligence and invent advanced nanotechnology, at which point the
<br>
cost of personal transcendence falls to zero.  I think that who gets to
<br>
participate in the Singularity will be determined by the answer of each
<br>
individual human to the question:  &quot;Hi!  Do you want to participate in the
<br>
Singularity?&quot;  You say &quot;Yes&quot;, you get uploaded, you run on your six-billionth
<br>
of the mass of the Solar System; whoever you were before the Singularity, you
<br>
are now a Citizen of Terran Space, coequal with any other Citizen.
<br>
<p>One of the major reasons I am *in* the Singularity biz is to wipe out
<br>
nonconsensual poverty.
<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel, does that satisfy your call for a humanist transhumanism?
