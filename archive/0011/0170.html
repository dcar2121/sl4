samantha:
<br>
Actually, you have a problem.  Given Singularity or even many of the things
<br>
along the way, providing for everyone and healing them of their fundamental
<br>
ills and limitations would not be impossible.  But there is a little matter
<br>
of free will. Will you heal someone whose brain is underpowered (whether
<br>
through genetics, human condition, malnutrition or whatever) and is
<br>
therefore limited in their enjoyment of life and possibilities against their
<br>
will?  You can at best only prepare the feast.  No one can be forced to eat.
<br>
<p>Mike:
<br>
This is an important problem that has been faced before. Augustine of Hippo,
<br>
the 4th century Catholic saint and philosopher, wrote a book detailing his
<br>
ideal Christian civilization that he titled _The City of God_. Augustine
<br>
reasoned that since eternal damnation would come to those who refused the
<br>
offer of salvation contained in his ideal City, it was the moral duty of
<br>
Christians to &quot;compel them to come in.&quot; From this philosophical idea came
<br>
the Crusades, the forced conversion of the native populations of North and
<br>
South America, and much other wickedness ostensibly perpetrated for the
<br>
ultimate benefit of those whom we deem today to have been Christianity's
<br>
victims.
<br>
<p>I don't know of any Extropians or Singularitarians who advocate or would
<br>
countenance the Augustinian approach. Nonetheless, we must reiterate often
<br>
our opposition to compulsion. Which is why the libertarian aspect of our
<br>
movement is so important. The principle of non-initiation of force as our
<br>
&quot;prime directive&quot; should keep us from &quot;compelling them to come in.&quot;
<br>
<p>At the same time, as Samantha pointed out, we must aim at improving the
<br>
conditions for those who choose to remain &quot;outside the gates,&quot; as it were,
<br>
so that they may eventually recognize the desirability of coming in by their
<br>
own volition.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael LaTorra
