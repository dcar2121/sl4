hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; First: I don't think that insanity has to do with thinking fast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slowly -- if so, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do intelligent people go nuts just as often as stupid people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My instinctive response is to say &quot;They don't&quot;, after which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look up the statistics... but that really wouldn't settle anything.
</em><br>
<p>According to the statistics I have seen (when I was a psychology professor
<br>
a few years ago), incidence of mental illness is not significantly
<br>
correlated with intelligence
<br>
<p>Of course the measurements of intelligence and mental illness are both
<br>
moderately
<br>
problematic, but still, the result is not meaningless...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The essential argument here is that a transhuman can *occupy*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but ve is unlikely to *reach* such a state.  The transhuman would see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming; if ve didn't see it coming, there would be early warning signs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flashing red lights on the exoself console, and so on.  Before a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can reach such a state, ve would need to first need to desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a state.
</em><br>
<p>I believe this is wrong.
<br>
<p>This assumes that an intelligent system can predict its own course of
<br>
development.
<br>
<p>Well, this is plainly wrong for humans...
<br>
<p>It's also unlikely from a mathematical perspective: in general, the
<br>
trajectories
<br>
of a dynamical system are too complex for them to all be recognizable using
<br>
the
<br>
system's own intelligence...
<br>
<p>This doesn't rule out the possibility that there are SOME systems that can
<br>
predict
<br>
their own future trajectories.  But the existence of such intelligent
<br>
systems is a pure
<br>
speculation -- as far as I know.  What evidence do you have that such
<br>
systems exist?
<br>
<p>My intuition is that the complexity and flexibility required of intelligence
<br>
DIRECTLY
<br>
CONTRADICTS the &quot;system can predict its own trajectories&quot; property that you
<br>
posit
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, the original argument was not that SOME transhumans might go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insane by choice, but that ALL transhumans would go insane inevitably; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter statement is almost certainly false.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, of course!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that transhumans will have the power to be intrinsically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sane.
</em><br>
<p>It's  a very interesting question, but I remain unconvinced...
