<em>&gt; Date: Thu, 14 Dec 2000 15:20:32 -0500
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20When%20Subgoals%20Attack">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The counterargument for CaTAI is the same as the counterargument for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans - that we are unified minds and that our subgoals don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent volition.  When was the last time your mind was taken over by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your auditory cortex?  Maybe you once had a tune you couldn't get out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your head, but there's a difference between a subprocess exhibiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior you don't like, and hypothesizing that a subprocess will exhibit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious volitional decision-making.  The auditory cortex may annoy you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it cannot plot against you; it has a what-it-does, not a will.
</em><br>
<p>With my Observation, I was trying to distinguish human intelligence which
<br>
really doesn't have this problem (unless you consider schizophrenia to
<br>
fall under this category), from a transhuman intelligence which *could*
<br>
reasonably create intelligent subprocesses for delegation purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One counterargument for transhumans is that it does not take &quot;infinite&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory to retain supergoal context, just the stardard amount of memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required for a Friendliness system, and thus you can have an ecology of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly cooperative processes united by a shared set of supergoals.
</em><br>
<p>That is a good answer and I'll accept that. I do believe that if 
<br>
transhuman AI's can evolve (ie. change), then they will be susceptible to 
<br>
to misinformation, call it a memetic infection (intentional), noise
<br>
(non-intentional), whatever. There might a need to have some sort of 
<br>
immune system that keeps the goal system pure, some sort of roving checksum 
<br>
bot (or something cleverer that a TAI would devise, since these bots can
<br>
be corrupted themselves). Biology has probably solved this problem many
<br>
times over and I'm sure the TAI will study every method! Can one ever
<br>
be completely confident? Maybe only &quot;confident enough&quot;.
<br>
<p>At some point, I'd imagine, there is a threshhold of diminishing returns,
<br>
beyond which any extra effort to prevent &quot;overthrow&quot; would be wasted. 
<br>
Hopefully after a trillion years of existence, statistics won't catch up
<br>
with you :) ... or you keep adding resources to Goal-Integrity-Maintenance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *The* counterargument for transhumans is that the whole idea of identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and identifying is itself an anthropomorphism.  Why aren't we worried that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transhuman's goal system will break off and decide to take over,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of being subservient to the complete entity?  Why aren't we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worried about individual functions developing self-awareness and deciding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to serve themselves instead of a whole?  
</em><br>
<p>I am worried. But hopefully the TAI will worry and come up with a really
<br>
good solution. &quot;Overthrow&quot; happens all the time in evolved power structures.
<br>
Maybe an entity which modifies itself in a more controlled manner will be
<br>
able to prevent it indefinitely. The worry is the same thing as asking &quot;How
<br>
might Friendliness get corrupted given a really, really long time?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can keep breaking it down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finer and finer, until at the end single bytes are identifying with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves instead of the group... something that would require around a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion percent overhead, speaking of infinite memory.
</em><br>
<p>Junk DNA might be evidence for this pattern on the genetic level.
<br>
<p>I think you can stop worrying when subgoals don't create their own subgoals.
<br>
Anything below that is &quot;dumb&quot;. Though one could conceive of scenarios in
<br>
which the wrong sequence of &quot;dumb&quot; subprocesses results in a very bad
<br>
situation. But I should not forget that the TAI would be ever vigilant
<br>
and very likely to avoid those situations as much as possible.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the interesting answers! I hope that passing the goal structure
<br>
down (or a refernce to it) makes it into CaTAI (or it was probably there 
<br>
already). And the immune system? I guess the TAI would come up with that
<br>
itself (if it is needed).
