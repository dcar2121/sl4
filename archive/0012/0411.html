<em>&gt; &gt; Because the human mind has an architecture which admits of no goal

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a grasp of the relation supergoal-of and subgoal-of; there's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary need for things to be organized any more neatly than that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And change propagation proceeds slowly relative to the speed of conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thought.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So how do you know that that lack of particular goal architecture isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of its strengths that self-consciousness and mental flexibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depends on? How do you know your AI will reach comparable consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and go beyond it with a more fixed hierarchical goal system?
</em><br>
<p>Several reasons:
<br>
<p>1)  I am not proposing a more fixed hierarchical goal system.  I am
<br>
proposing a goal network which is strictly directional and which strictly
<br>
distinguishes between supergoals and subgoals.
<br>
<p>2)  I do not know of any particular strength of self-consciousness or
<br>
mental flexibility which relies on goal directionality being local rather
<br>
than global.  I do know that a lot of human philosophy rests on the useful
<br>
conflation of subgoals and supergoals, but this should be duplicable, and
<br>
in a more context-sensitive way, without the necessity for conflating all
<br>
goals into a single type.
<br>
<p>3)  My take on the human goal system is that it is unnecessarily complex
<br>
and contains a great deal of nonfunctional messiness.  This does not mean
<br>
that a crystalline goal system is good.  Goal systems for seed AIs will
<br>
need to be built up out of high-level thoughts, including fragments of
<br>
mental imagery that deal with multiple possibilities, and including
<br>
context-sensitivity and the ability to react to errors, and the ability to
<br>
plan for errors, and Friendliness will require considerable philosophical
<br>
consideration on top of that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if the initial statement itself or rather its embodiment in goal[s]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and subgoals is not adequate for its satisfaction
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Satisfaction&quot;?  Where did that come from?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then there is little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice but to rearrange goals themselves.  Reword, recast, reprogram.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is quite possible that former subgoals become elevated in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process.  The supergoal/subgoal hiearachy is a tool, a way of organizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system, it is not the Goal itself.
</em><br>
<p>No, it is not the Goal, it is a probabilistic image of the Goal; and a set
<br>
of constraints - in the informational sense - on which Goal is being
<br>
referred to; and, ultimately, if all else fails, a specification of the
<br>
Goal.  Nonetheless it is all the image that the system has at any given
<br>
point, unless genuine objective morality is discovered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some problems may require &quot;cheating&quot; in that the goal system has strange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linkages and loops that involve seeming or real contradictions to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design you propose.
</em><br>
<p>Seeming contradictions are no problem.  I defy you to name a challenge
<br>
which requires a real contradiction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your above analogy would blow your system architecture apart.  Over and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over again we have found that individual freedom to pursue individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals does more for the overall good than any sort of top down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization.
</em><br>
<p>Really?  Okay, I demand the immediate liberation of your visual cortex to
<br>
pursue the independent processing of whichever pixels it finds most
<br>
interesting.  I can no longer tolerate your enslavement of a living
<br>
cognitive subsystem to your mere navigational requirements.
