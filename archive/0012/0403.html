<p>Well, let's say that there are truly independent subprocesses, and one of
<br>
them has different factual information from the superprocess, resulting in
<br>
an infinitesimally different set of subgoals, albeit the same supergoals. 
<br>
Thus, a goal conflict arises.  However, only a human would take this as
<br>
being a cause that mandates overthrowing the global Sysop... if that
<br>
phrase, &quot;global Sysop&quot;, even makes sense.  The reason *we* are worried
<br>
about this problem is that we *intuitively* recognize that a .00001%
<br>
disagreement is not just cause for starting a civil war that may have
<br>
human casualties.
<br>
<p>But this argument translates into Friendliness terms as well!  A
<br>
subprocess has the choice of either ignoring the problem - agreeing to
<br>
disagree with the superprocess, as 'twere - or else of starting the civil
<br>
war.  Ignoring the problem will result in some infinitesimal decrement of
<br>
Friendliness fulfillment over the maximum.  Starting the civil war results
<br>
in a huge decrement of Friendliness fulfillment over the maximum. 
<br>
Therefore, the rational course is to ignore the minor conflict.
<br>
<p>It is also worth considering that local Friendliness and global
<br>
Friendliness are supposed to be identical and to derive their validity
<br>
from identical causes, and that the global mind (if any) is supposed to be
<br>
smarter than the local subprocess tasked with controlling thread resource
<br>
pooling.  So it also makes sense for the local subprocess to assume that
<br>
the superprocess knows something it doesn't, and defer to the superprocess
<br>
on those grounds.  Technically, we would say that the local subprocess has
<br>
a probabilistic model of Friendliness and that the local subprocess
<br>
correctly believes the superprocess to have a better model.
