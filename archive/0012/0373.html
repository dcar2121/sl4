<p><em>&gt; I got the impression that Yatima was supposed to be an actual AI -- or at

</em><br>
<p>Yatima certainly wasn't born in the flesh.  Ve is an orphan, synthesized
<br>
rather than parented, but there's an enormous difference between a
<br>
synthesized human and an Artifical Intelligence (though the correct
<br>
response to that is &quot;What kind of AI?&quot;  It's a much larger cognitive space
<br>
than the point we occupy).  Yatima is analogous to a human produced by
<br>
synthesizing forty-six randomly selected chromosomes plus a handful of
<br>
deliberately mutated codons.  The result is an orphan and the result is
<br>
synthetic, but the result is most certainly not an AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, my guess is that uploaded humans will deviate a lot further from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current human psychology than is depicted in this novel...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's what I was complaining about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; All the characters are utterly human.  Not &quot;watered-down&quot;, I didn't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that impression; but neither of transhuman intelligence, nor departing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significantly from the human cognitive architecture.  There are people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alive in today's world who are less human than Yatima, Inoshiro, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Blanca.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's what I mean by &quot;less human, no story&quot;.  If Inoshiro had simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dealt with the fear and loathing in one form or another, it would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eliminated yet another emotional-tension source in the plot, already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fairly skimpy due to what little nonhumanity the characters did have...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess what I'm suspecting is that there will be new kinds of tensions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerging, different from what we consider &quot;emotional&quot; now... but also different from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the peculiar coolness of the Diasporans...
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps.  But it is beyond what even Greg Egan can ask of an audience for
<br>
us to sympathize with these tensions.  The most that either author or
<br>
reader could do would be to reason about them abstractly.  The hunt and
<br>
bloodlust of a Dirdir or the diffident calm of a Pnume makes a nicely
<br>
eerie *background* for a Jack Vance novel, but it would be difficult -
<br>
almost beyond imagining - to have one of them for a main character.  And
<br>
even Dirdir and Pnume are still evolved organisms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Of course, this makes it kind of ironic that you called Inoshiro a &quot;he&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ve's neutral.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;He&quot; is neutral in standard english... I don't mind &quot;ve&quot; but it doesn't come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally...
</em><br>
<p>I also used to think that &quot;he&quot; was neutral.  Then I started reading Greg
<br>
Egan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The Soft Ones weren't Asimov's worst aliens, but I wouldn't rate them as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being Alien aliens in the tradition of, say, Jack Vance and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Chasch/Wankh/Dirdir/Pnume, or even Niven and Pournelle's Moties.  In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'd rate the Soft Ones as being considerably more human than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Diasporans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More emotional but less human, in my view...
</em><br>
<p>In one sense, I agree with you, if you mean &quot;human as opposed to some
<br>
other evolved alien species&quot;, since the basic cognitive architecture might
<br>
well turn out to be the same.  Or we could see the Pnume, but I wouldn't
<br>
really be surprised to find basically human social practices and so on,
<br>
the fundamental set of human emotion and reflexes, in a species that
<br>
evolved on another planet.  Most of our emotional detail is not obviously
<br>
dependent on conditions of the Earth physical environment, but the social
<br>
environment, which floats abstractly above the color of the sky and the
<br>
force of gravity.  But the Soft Ones certainly aren't AIs or even
<br>
Diasporans.
<br>
<p>Did you ever read &quot;Bartlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, it's a really good book, I recommended it to a bunch of friends!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I'm looking forward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to another book that explores posthuman psychology with more subtlety...
</em><br>
<p>Let me know if ever you find one.
