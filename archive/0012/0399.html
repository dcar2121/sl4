</em><br>
<p>Maybe this is an issue of how our brains work, or at least how I 
<br>
would like them to work, and then how that can be applied to 
<br>
transhuman and beyond intelligences.  The metaphors are getting 
<br>
cofusing (at least to me), so I'm going to forego them.  According to 
<br>
you (or at least as I understand what you've written), in the mind 
<br>
there is an intelligence that is you, and you are it.  Then, there 
<br>
are subintelligences created that have been given the task of doing 
<br>
things that the main intelligence doesn't have time for.  Having 
<br>
spent some more time thinking about it, I think that the goals of the 
<br>
main intelligence result in the creation of dumb processes (but not 
<br>
automata) that do things like hardware control (wet or dry, depending 
<br>
on the level of transcendance) and that there is no need to spawn 
<br>
more intelligent processes (even dumb ones) unless the main 
<br>
intelligence wants 'children' (this seems like the best way for an AI 
<br>
to get kids, if ve even wants them), taking care of all the hard work 
<br>
as subprocesses in the main intelligence, so that there are no goal 
<br>
conflicts (or no more than exist in the average humans who have 
<br>
failed to find their way to this list ;-)).
<br>
<p>To sum up, don't create intelligent processes with root access unless 
<br>
they are root (oops, that's two Unix metaphors in one day), and all 
<br>
will be fine.  To go back to original metaphor, only the king is the 
<br>
king, even if the king has multiple facets, so long as not even the 
<br>
viceroy can wear the crown.
<br>
<p>Having written this post, I may be 'me too'ing Eliezer (or at least 
<br>
Eliezer through Durant), but I didn't get what I've written out of 
<br>
his post, so maybe other people didn't, either.
