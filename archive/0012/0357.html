<p>Sure, &quot;wisdom tournaments&quot;.
<br>
<p>One of the major sources of human wisdom is everything we go through in
<br>
learning to build a nice-looking self out of all the emotional dreck and
<br>
memetic misinformation we're born with.  If an AI is born as a nice
<br>
person, will it have all that complexity?
<br>
<p>Take it a step farther; give the AI actual ethical misinformation and see
<br>
if it can learn to reject it.  Though not in real reality, of course. 
<br>
What you want to do is add a layer on the interpreter, so that it's a
<br>
what-if scenario and not an actual AI.  AIs, unlike humans, should have
<br>
the ability to run what-if scenarios (&quot;What would I say if I believed that
<br>
grass was purple?&quot;) that are genuinely as good as the real thing.  Running
<br>
an AI with ethical misinformation is *not* a good thing to do in
<br>
bottom-level reality.
<br>
<p>That said - run it on unreliable simulated hardware, with random
<br>
perturbations to the software, ethical misinformation, factual
<br>
misinformation, tempting ends-justify-the-means scenarios, and an instinct
<br>
to kill and destroy.  If the Friendliness, and the heuristics the AI has
<br>
learned from past tournaments, are enough to walk through all that without
<br>
making a single nonrecoverable error, then the Friendliness may be strong
<br>
enough to face real life.
<br>
<p>Of course, in the beginning, most of this is likely to consist of the AI
<br>
watching its simulated self crash and burn and end up as a Nazi.  But the
<br>
layer-that-watches will learn something from it, and eventually the seed
<br>
AI will be far more resistant to every kind of foolishness than any human.
<br>
<p>On a much more mundane scale, you can use wisdom tournaments to strengthen
<br>
ordinary reasoning heuristics.  First you solve the problem, then you
<br>
resolve the problem with half your brain tied behind your back, then you
<br>
resolve the problem after mixing in all kinds of misconceptions.  When
<br>
you're done, you may be smart enough to find a better problem.  That's how
<br>
you keep the bootstrap cycle from petering out; first you solve the
<br>
problem, then you oversolve it.
