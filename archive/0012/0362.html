<p>
Well, I finally read the novel Diaspora ....
<br>
<p>Most of all it reminded me of Olaf Stapledon's &quot;Star Maker,&quot; though lacking
<br>
a bit of the
<br>
latter's primal energy...
<br>
<p>I definitely enjoyed it -- it livened up a week's worth of subway rides into
<br>
the office...
<br>
<p>Technologically, I found it to be a plausible extrapolation of current
<br>
computing technology...
<br>
the move into alternate universes was a nice touch (back in Stapledon's
<br>
time, a single universe was
<br>
adequate to sound gee-wizzy, but we've gone beyond that now!)
<br>
<p>The most peculiarly disappointing aspect of the book, however, was the
<br>
extreme lack of imagination in
<br>
the area of &quot;AI psychology.&quot;  The AI's seemed to have personalities closely
<br>
resembling watered-down
<br>
human personalities....  Perhaps this is just because Egan is weak at
<br>
characterization -- I haven't
<br>
read any of his other books, so I don't know.  Perhaps it mainly reflects a
<br>
conscious
<br>
choice by the author to focus on technology rather than psychology.  But to
<br>
some extent, it must
<br>
represent the author's prognostication, and to this extent, I think he's got
<br>
to be way wrong....
<br>
<p>When the AI Inoshiro gets frustrated with the pains of life, he loads a
<br>
Buddhist frame of mind and gets locked
<br>
into an endless attractor?  It was a fairly funny scene -- even my wife,
<br>
who's a Zen Buddhist priest, got
<br>
a bit of kick out of it.  But it's odd to think that future AI's won't have
<br>
entirely different psychological
<br>
tricks to deal with such things...
<br>
<p>Asimov, in &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot;, did a pretty good job of envisioning an
<br>
alien psychology (I hope I got the
<br>
name of that novel right... I'm thinking of the one where he describes a
<br>
species with three sexes....)  I'm sure
<br>
that future AI's will have far more bizarre (to us) and diverse
<br>
psychological aspects than Asimov's three-sexed
<br>
aliens....
<br>
<p>One thing that fascinates me a lot about the future of AI is the possibility
<br>
of a dissolution of the boundary
<br>
between self and society.  We think about individual minds, or about &quot;borg
<br>
collective&quot; type hive minds, but there
<br>
have got to be a lot of possibilities &quot;inbetween&quot; ... social mind-fields
<br>
with temporary bubbling-up pattern-
<br>
attractors serving as ephemeral individuals, for example... This is where
<br>
the future of mind is going to get
<br>
really trippy!
<br>
<p>Value systems as we know them are about restraining the will of the
<br>
individual in order to achieve the good
<br>
of the collective. But our very notions of &quot;individual&quot; and &quot;collective&quot; are
<br>
a consequence of the peculiarities
<br>
of our physical embodiment.  Value systems as we know them aren't going to
<br>
exist for long, because the
<br>
preconditions for their meaningfulness will disappear...
