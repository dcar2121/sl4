<em>&gt;Not just they, but their *genes*, are afraid of getting caught.  When a

</em><br>
<p>Why a gene?  How are genes afraid?  From the gene research I've read, 
<br>
all that genes have been proven to determine is physical traits, not 
<br>
natural behavior.  I realize that this is an Argument from Ignorance, 
<br>
but maybe we are both thinking about the same concept:  natural laws. 
<br>
Humans make a commitment not to kill because that is the way the 
<br>
system works.  It works that way because it is the most selfish way 
<br>
it could work, since when other people are alive they can do more for 
<br>
one than when dead.  If we're not think the same thing, can you 
<br>
please explain what you mean by genes being afraid and how that leads 
<br>
to a commitment not to kill?  Are you thinking in the sense that 
<br>
people want their genes to be carried down into other generations, 
<br>
and if they die then their genes will end there?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; AIs with &quot;instincts&quot; at all.  Humans don't just have instincts - for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; survival, for compassion, for whatever - but whole vast hosts of evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  complexity that prevent the instincts from getting out of hand in silly,
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I just don't know my psychology that well, but as I recall 
<br>
instincts, as in born in traits, have not been proven to exist as 
<br>
widely as you are claiming.  I realize that, for practical purposes, 
<br>
instincts don't differ very much from natural laws, but if AIs must 
<br>
follow natural laws, then they have no need for insticts and will 
<br>
develop complex behavior based solely on the nature of their 
<br>
existance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Creating an AI whose goal is to &quot;maximize pleasure&quot; is really dangerous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  much more dangerous than it would be to tell a human that the purpose of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; life is maximizing pleasure.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so, since pleasure is not necessairly the best choice, but an 
<br>
AI that is completely selfish should be safe, or at least be fair. 
<br>
If ve is not programmed to be selfish, then ve has not been given the 
<br>
same standing as you or me get, even if ve is more intelligent than 
<br>
us.  If ve were not selfish, then how could ve live in coexistance 
<br>
with the selfish humans?  An unselfish AI would end in destruction in 
<br>
one way or another, because ve eliminates problems that keep humans 
<br>
in check or destroyes humans in the process of being altruistic to 
<br>
some other group, whether they be humans or AIs.
