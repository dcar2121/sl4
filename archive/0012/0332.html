<em>&gt; How do you force an AI to make generalisations when it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to &quot;look it up&quot;? Are you saying that the AI should just look up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exceptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to its generalisations whenever needed -- or rather, check if there's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exception whenever it uses a generalisation?
</em><br>
<p>I'm saying that, when dealing with a situation quite different to one that's
<br>
been encountered before, generalizations are the best guidance.
<br>
<p>However, with a big memory, one can store a lot of particulars as well as
<br>
generalizations,
<br>
and then try to make the right decision in each situation as to whether to
<br>
apply general
<br>
or particular knowledge to that situation.
<br>
<p>With a limited memory, one doesn't have the choice, because one must throw
<br>
out most
<br>
particulars...
<br>
<p>Perhaps you're assuming that erroneousness itself adds some useful creative
<br>
&quot;noise&quot;
<br>
to the thought process, whereas a system with a good enough  memory won't
<br>
make enough
<br>
errors to lead to creative thoughts.  It's possible.  Again, we lack the
<br>
science to
<br>
quantify this effect.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Lacking infinite memory, some error is necessary due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overgeneralization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (overfitting).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, I obviously didn't explain overfitting properly. With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;overfitting&quot;, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant the act of taking the data too literally and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generalising at all.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, trust me, I understand the concept of overfitting -- I've done
<br>
empirical work with financial
<br>
trading systems for the last 3 years.
<br>
<p>My statement was not careful enough.  Even with infinite memory, some
<br>
overfitting is necessary
<br>
if one is generalizing from a finite history.  However, if there are serious
<br>
memory limitations as well
<br>
as data limitations, then overfitting is even MORE severe, because one's
<br>
memory can't even hold all
<br>
the available data, only generalizations formed from the data.  With memory
<br>
limitations one is overfitting
<br>
to an even smaller subset of the data than is necessary.
<br>
<p>For instance, in financial work, some overfitting is necessary because the
<br>
market can always move into
<br>
a new regime, not covered by the patterns from the past.  But it's also true
<br>
that if one incorporates
<br>
additional data into one's model (derived from text or non-financial
<br>
economic indicators or foreign markets
<br>
for example), one can come up with more robust models, because one is
<br>
fitting to more data.  IN a data-rich
<br>
situation, more memory decreases the severity of overfitting, in general.
