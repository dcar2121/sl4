<p>Since you have some experience, I'll assume that what you are writing 
<br>
to true for practical purposes as of now.  This will be relavent in a 
<br>
moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A brain requires a higher degree of overall

</em><br>
<p>Now, I haven't done much in the realm of AI, but I have done a good 
<br>
bit of AL and see no reason why, given enough processing power, lots 
<br>
of automata couldn't form an intelligence from their society.  I've 
<br>
seen it happen on the small scale (some of the automata get together 
<br>
and their interactions causes the group to do something intelligent 
<br>
(a *very* simple example is a glider in Conway's Game of Life)).  For 
<br>
practical purposes, the only problem is processing power, which will 
<br>
be less of a problem in the future.  You make use of the word brain, 
<br>
though, so trying to replicate a brain would, of course, require a 
<br>
certain amount of control that exist in human brains, but, for an 
<br>
intelligence, it should be possible to do it by creating a system of 
<br>
automata with the right rules of interaction to form a societal 
<br>
intelligence that will outwardly seem like any other, but on the 
<br>
inside work in a very different way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Like many other things, it's a question of balance
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't buy this balance thing.  Things must reach perfection 
<br>
(or at least that's how my mind wants them to be), and to do so they 
<br>
cannot rest at some point inbetween options for perfection unless 
<br>
they are at such a spot that the balance is exact, meaning another 
<br>
perfection.  Reaching that perfect balance is practically impossible, 
<br>
since it is all too easy to fall off of the perfect point by doing x 
<br>
or y that moves off of the point, but also it assumes that there are 
<br>
two or more perfect ways to do something, which is possible, but not 
<br>
very likely.  Prehaps my main personal reason for being an anarchist 
<br>
is that I see no form of government (other than self government, if 
<br>
you want to get technical) as perfect, so the only way to perfection 
<br>
is to eliminate it.&lt;/rant&gt;
