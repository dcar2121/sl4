<p>
First of all, buzz away if I'm below SL4, I won't mind. However, I'd really
<br>
appreciate it if someone pointed out why generalisation is not a problem. If
<br>
this is stuff that you've already discussed on this list, just tell me what
<br>
conclusions you've already reached, or tell me what book or paper I should read
<br>
if there's something on this.
<br>
<p>We need to generalise in order to acquire knowledge and apply it in different
<br>
circumstances. The exception to this is that we have a lot of highly specialised
<br>
sensomotory knowledge (at least according to Piaget), but I'll use the term
<br>
&quot;knowledge&quot; to refer to knowledge of more or less abstract concepts, stuff that
<br>
we usually associate with intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure most people on this list who are moderately interested in neural
<br>
networks have heard of the phenomenon known as &quot;overfitting&quot;. For those of you
<br>
who haven't heard of it, overfitting occurs when a neural network becomes too
<br>
rigid as a result of having too many neurons. A network that suffers from
<br>
overfitting can't generalise; it's lost the fuzziness and organic quality that
<br>
neural networks are known for. However, a network that generalises isn't
<br>
entirely accurate; in some sense, it's not as smart as it could be. So it's
<br>
obviously a trade-off: the network is either rigid or organic. I believe that
<br>
there is no middle ground, since you can always come up with nice exceptions to
<br>
the norm that refuse to be neatly classified.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the premises that generalisation is an integral part of intelligence,
<br>
and generalisation is a way of minimising storage space, doesn't this pose a
<br>
problem? Is there a point that intelligence can't cross because it relies on
<br>
generalisation? If an AI stores everything it comes across, it might not
<br>
generalise properly (it ends up being an expert system -- *shudder*), which
<br>
means it won't be able to handle new situations effectively. However, if it does
<br>
generalise, it won't have the crystalline quality of today's computers, i.e. it
<br>
will make mistakes. Do we want an AI to make mistakes? Doesn't that imply a
<br>
limit to intelligence? Are all generalisations bad?
<br>
<p>To sum it up: Is there some way to combine the fuzzy quality that intelligence
<br>
relies on with the rigid quality of not making a single mistake? Is
<br>
generalisation a limit to intelligence?
<br>
