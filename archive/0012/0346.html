<p><p>I recently joined this list and have been watching this
<br>
thread with some interest.  Some of the discussion seems odd, if only
<br>
because I am approaching this issue from a completely different angle.
<br>
<p>A lot of this quantitative science (mathematics really) has already been
<br>
done.  Or at least, a lot more has been done than is apparently assumed by
<br>
some of what I have seen written on this list. 
<br>
<p>Information theoretic approaches have already demonstrated much of what is
<br>
being questioned, or at least insofar as finite-state machines are
<br>
concerned.  Generally speaking, given a finite amount of memory and an
<br>
arbitrarily long sequence of data (generated by any finite state machine
<br>
no matter how complex), it is possible to attain the minimum possible
<br>
predictive error rate using universal prediction schemes.  An optimal
<br>
prediction scheme can be algorithmically generated and the error rate
<br>
figured for any data generated by finite-state machinery. &lt;much lengthy
<br>
theory omitted&gt;  In short, it has been demonstrated that for any finite
<br>
state machine, it is possible to ascertain the minimum possible predictive
<br>
error rate for any data sequence given any finite amount of memory.  An
<br>
optimal prediction scheme will typically approach the theoretical error
<br>
limit quite fast.  However, sub-optimal prediction schemes, nonparametric
<br>
or unknown models, and similar types of situations may approach their
<br>
theoretical error rates quite slowly.  It would be trivial for a
<br>
computer today to calculate error rates for any optimal universal
<br>
predictive scheme.  These would seem to answer the above question and
<br>
quite a few others I've seen on this thread.  The only glaring exception
<br>
to the above is if AIs don't run on finite state machinery.
<br>
<p>Among the interesting things that have been shown with respect to this is
<br>
that humans are quite apparently finite state-machines.  The first example
<br>
of this was Hagelbarger at Bell Labs (and later Claude Shannon), who first
<br>
demonstrated that humans are apparently unable to generate truly random
<br>
sequences of any kind; computers using information theoretic prediction
<br>
algorithms were able to successfully predict the behavior of humans
<br>
intentionally attempting to generate random data, with an error rate many,
<br>
many orders of magnitude below what would be expected if the human
<br>
participants were actually generating random data.
<br>
<p>I've actually been using information theoretic approaches in my engines
<br>
for several years now, and with generally superb results across many
<br>
fields.  It has been widely rumored that Claude Shannon made his fortune by
<br>
&quot;working&quot; the stock market (as an aside, a couple years ago I calculated
<br>
that running an optimal predictive engine against the entire NASDAQ in
<br>
realtime, based on the best engine I had produced to date, would require a
<br>
machine capable of 10^11 Flops sustained. The amount of memory was
<br>
reasonably attainable though.)   I've found it odd that information theory
<br>
is routinely overlooked in AI research since it provides such a solid
<br>
foundation for the mathematical basis of the topic.
<br>
<p>I am currently working on putting together a website with a lot of
<br>
the theory and actual application of my work, quite a few parts of which
<br>
have been applied in the commercial sector.  Splitting my time between
<br>
this, audio signal analysis/processing research, and something resembling a
<br>
9-5 has me strapped for time, but hopefully I will get some descriptive and
<br>
more in-depth articles published on my website relatively soon.  I've been
<br>
working on adaptive and self-learning systems for many years (though I
<br>
only really started working on AI when it was clear that a lot of the
<br>
research and development I was doing was very applicable to that
<br>
particular domain -- my original interests were some neglected areas of
<br>
database theory).
