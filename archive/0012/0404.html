<em>&gt; The counterargument for CaTAI is the same as the counterargument for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans - that we are unified minds and that our subgoals don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent volition.  When was the last time your mind was taken over by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your auditory cortex?  Maybe you once had a tune you couldn't get out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your head, but there's a difference between a subprocess exhibiting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior you don't like, and hypothesizing that a subprocess will exhibit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious volitional decision-making.  The auditory cortex may annoy you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it cannot plot against you; it has a what-it-does, not a will.
</em><br>
<p>The auditory cortex is not a subgoal or subprocess/substructure set up by
<br>
the mind, it's
<br>
a subprocess/substructure set up by evolution...
<br>
<p>Sexuality is a subgoal set up by evolution, which has overtaken its
<br>
supergoal (procreation)
<br>
in many cases.  Elsewise, people would never use birth control.
<br>
<p>Sometimes the subgoal should take over for the goal.  If your goal is to
<br>
write a book, and
<br>
a subgoal of this is to solve a certain intellectual problem, you may find
<br>
out that the problem
<br>
itself is more interesting than book-writing... give up the book-writing
<br>
project and devote yourself
<br>
only to the problem.  The subgoal then replaces its supergoal as a way of
<br>
achieving the supersupergoal
<br>
of amusing oneself, stimulating one's mind, or whatever...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *The* counterargument for transhumans is that the whole idea of identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and identifying is itself an anthropomorphism.  Why aren't we worried that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transhuman's goal system will break off and decide to take over,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of being subservient to the complete entity?  Why aren't we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worried about individual functions developing self-awareness and deciding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to serve themselves instead of a whole?  You can keep breaking it down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finer and finer, until at the end single bytes are identifying with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves instead of the group... something that would require around a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion percent overhead, speaking of infinite memory.
</em><br>
<p><p>No, a single byte is not really capable of containing a self-model and the
<br>
processes
<br>
for maintaining this self-model.
<br>
<p>But I have clearly lost track of your thread, at this point .. sorry...
<br>
<p>I do believe that &quot;alienated subgoals&quot; are an inevitable part of
<br>
intelligence, but I also suspect
<br>
that this phenomenon can be reduced to a much lower level than we see in the
<br>
human mind, in a transhuman
<br>
AI.
