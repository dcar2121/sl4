<em>&gt; The most peculiarly disappointing aspect of the book, however, was the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; resembling watered-down
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; characterization -- I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read any of his other books, so I don't know.  Perhaps it mainly reflects a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice by the author to focus on technology rather than psychology.  But to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some extent, it must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent the author's prognostication, and to this extent, I think he's got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be way wrong....
</em><br>
<p>They aren't *supposed* to be AIs.  They're supposed to be uploaded humans,
<br>
or rather, their descendants.
<br>
<p>The only actual refugee of the flesh, I believe, is Orlando.  The only
<br>
actual AI is probably the Contingency Handler.
<br>
<p>All the characters are utterly human.  Not &quot;watered-down&quot;, I didn't get
<br>
that impression; but neither of transhuman intelligence, nor departing
<br>
significantly from the human cognitive architecture.  There are people
<br>
alive in today's world who are less human than Yatima, Inoshiro, or
<br>
Blanca.
<br>
<p>Of course, Greg Egan, the author, is a human himself.  And it's quite
<br>
possible that if he'd made the protagonists just a little less human,
<br>
there wouldn't have been any story.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When the AI Inoshiro gets frustrated with the pains of life, he loads a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhist frame of mind and gets locked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into an endless attractor?  It was a fairly funny scene -- even my wife,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who's a Zen Buddhist priest, got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bit of kick out of it.  But it's odd to think that future AI's won't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely different psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tricks to deal with such things...
</em><br>
<p>That's what I mean by &quot;less human, no story&quot;.  If Inoshiro had simply
<br>
dealt with the fear and loathing in one form or another, it would have
<br>
eliminated yet another emotional-tension source in the plot, already
<br>
fairly skimpy due to what little nonhumanity the characters did have...
<br>
<p>Of course, this makes it kind of ironic that you called Inoshiro a &quot;he&quot;. 
<br>
Ve's neutral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Asimov, in &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot;, did a pretty good job of envisioning an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien psychology (I hope I got the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name of that novel right... I'm thinking of the one where he describes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species with three sexes....)  I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that future AI's will have far more bizarre (to us) and diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological aspects than Asimov's three-sexed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aliens....
</em><br>
<p>The Soft Ones weren't Asimov's worst aliens, but I wouldn't rate them as
<br>
being Alien aliens in the tradition of, say, Jack Vance and the
<br>
Chasch/Wankh/Dirdir/Pnume, or even Niven and Pournelle's Moties.  In fact,
<br>
I'd rate the Soft Ones as being considerably more human than the
<br>
Diasporans.
