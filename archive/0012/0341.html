Hi again,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, the refutation: A sufficiently intelligent, self-aware system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite capable of modifying itself to make itself MORE ERROR-PRONE if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finds through experimentation that this makes it more intelligent ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but that isn't necessarily a solution. You might find that it will get
<br>
stuck in a loop where it is at first too error-prone to realise that it's
<br>
intelligent, and when it works out all the glitches it realises that it needs to
<br>
be more error-prone, which brings it back to the beginning. Either that, or it
<br>
might find the perfect error/perfection or generalising/overfitting ratio.
<br>
Perhaps then it will find a second dimension that will raise its intelligence?
<br>
Or do no other variables raise intelligence per se?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So the problem you describe seems to apply to a far-future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation of hardware plenty...
</em><br>
<p>Yep. This is (currently) a purely hypothetical discussion about the theoretical
<br>
limits to intelligence.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What I mean is that even if there is a LOT of data, and it's highly varied,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is still a certain amount of overfitting that is inevitable.
</em><br>
<p>That can't be right. Take a single perceptron -- a very basic artificial
<br>
neuron -- that classifies a set of points of types A and B, nearly linearly
<br>
separable, in 2D space using a single line. With a lot of varied data in your
<br>
training set, you can't get any overfitting using just a single neuron.
<br>
Overfitting isn't inherent in all generalisations, it's just a result of having
<br>
too sophisticated soft-/hardware to solve a certain problem. It's like trying
<br>
too hard. The solution is just to not try at all or use minimal effort, in which
<br>
case you'll have an acceptable generalisation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; On the other hand, the more memory you have, the more of this data you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep in mind for use for new model-building rounds based on new data combined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the old.  So the maximum-memory system will achieve the minimum amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of possible overfitting given the data.
</em><br>
<p>I can't grasp this either. It goes totally against my concept of overfitting. I
<br>
always thought that the more sophisticated method of generalisation, the worse
<br>
results for easy problems. Which is why I think it's a limit to intelligence.
