This is one of the strangest things I've ever heard.  Preliminary poking
<br>
around on the 'Net seems to confirm that Humphrey Maris is a genuine,
<br>
respected physicist, and that the people quoted in the articles are
<br>
likewise genuine.  Though with news like this I wouldn't be in the least
<br>
surprised if someone corrected me and said he had known newts in the
<br>
belfry.  If it is true, I'm very surprised there's been less flap about
<br>
it.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the electron be cut in half? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AT THE TIME no one even realised it had happened.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than thirty years ago, researchers in Minnesota did
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the unthinkable and broke the &quot;indivisible&quot; electron into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fragments. This, at least, is the contention of British
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physicist Humphrey Maris, and no one has yet been able
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to prove him wrong. &quot;Electron fragments behave to all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intents and purposes like entirely separate particles,&quot; says
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris, who is based at Brown University in Rhode Island.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I call them electrinos.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause a moment to consider what Maris is saying. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electron is the lightest subatomic particle and the one with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the greatest claim to being absolutely fundamental. In fact,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the 103 years since its discovery, there has been no
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other evidence whatsoever that the electron is divisible. It
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the modern incarnation of Democritus's &quot;uncuttable&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atom. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The claim that electrons are divisible is therefore nothing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;short of a bombshell dropped into the world of physics. &quot;If
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humphrey is correct, it means a Nobel Prize,&quot; says Gary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ihas of the University of Florida. Nobel prizewinner Philip
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anderson of Princeton University thinks Maris must be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong. &quot;But it's not obvious why,&quot; he admits. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris does not have definitive proof of his hypothesis. But
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earlier this year he published a paper that put it on a firm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theoretical basis, and marshalled supporting evidence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from past experiments. Now he is doing his own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiments, trying to break up the electron. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether Maris succeeds or not, he may have found a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;large crack in one of the foundation stones of modern
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics. &quot;Humphrey has succeeded in exposing a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental flaw in the framework of quantum theory,&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says Peter McClintock of the University of Lancaster. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This astonishing heresy is centred around the electron's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wave function, the mathematical entity that, according to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quantum theory, encapsulates everything about the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electron that it is possible for us to know. Among other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things, an electron's wave function describes the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probability of finding it at any particular location. The wave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function of an electron confined to, say, a spherical cavity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the three-dimensional description of how the electron's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location is &quot;smeared out&quot; over the space. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its lowest energy state, the wave function is spherical.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next highest energy level gives the wave function a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dumb-bell shape. &quot;It was while thinking about this state I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was led to the conclusion that an electron might split in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two,&quot; says Maris. If the dumb-bell could be stretched and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pinched, he reasoned, might it simply divide? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris is expert in liquid helium, a substance that gives
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physicists the perfect opportunity to test this idea because
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electrons can exist independently and autonomously within
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it. When electrons from a radioactive source are fired into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a vat of helium, repeated interactions with the electrons of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the helium atoms slow them down until, finally, they grind to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a halt. The intruding electrons do not attach themselves to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helium atoms as a third electron, however. The Pauli
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exclusion principle makes sure of that, because it forbids
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than two electrons from sharing the same quantum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state. Faced with helium atoms whose electrons have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bagged the lowest energy state-the ground state-an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interloper with no spare energy has no choice but to lodge
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the space between atoms. There it clears a bubble of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space around itself-an electron bubble. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electron bubbles form only in certain types of liquid-those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in which the van der Waals force of attraction between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms is weak enough to allow an electron to push them
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apart. In fact only two substances fit the bill: liquid helium
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and liquid hydrogen. At very low temperatures in helium,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electron bubbles displace more than 700 helium atoms,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creating a cavity around 38 angstroms (3.8 nanometres)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;across. Inside this cavity quantum mechanics rules,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensuring that the electron can occupy only a limited set of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy states. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light touch
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris worked out that an electron in a bubble could be put
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the dumb-bell-shaped excited state by illuminating the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helium with light that had a wavelength of about 10
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;micrometres, which is easily supplied by a carbon dioxide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laser. In this state, Maris calculated, the electron imparts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most of its force to the ends of the dumb-bell; this force is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough, he realised, to make the bubble wall wobble
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violently. &quot;I found that the force exerted by the electron was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to elongate the bubble until it formed a thin neck,&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he says. &quot;If the pressure in the liquid was great enough,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was the possibility of it pinching off the neck so that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bubble might actually split in two.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sounds harmless enough, but the implications are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staggering. If the bubble split, half of the electron's wave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function would be trapped in each of the two daughter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bubbles (see Diagram). As the wave function is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;essence of an electron, the electron would be split into
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two. The indivisible would have been divided. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris planned to test his idea in the laboratory but first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decided to search back through the literature to see
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether anyone had done the kind of experiments he had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in mind. He soon found what he was looking for. In the late
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1960s, Jan Northby and Mike Sanders at the University of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minnesota studied the speed of electron bubbles moving
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an electric field in liquid helium. They measured the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electric current that flowed as the bubbles moved, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then illuminated the helium with light. The researchers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected this to increase the current. They reasoned that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light would eject some of the electrons from the bubbles,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that these would whiz through the helium, boosting the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current-and that is exactly what they observed. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as physicists have since realised, this reasoning was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flawed. &quot;We now know that knocked-out electrons form
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new electron bubbles,&quot; says Maris. &quot;The current should not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have increased.&quot; Inexplicably, however, it did. In 1990 and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1992, researchers at Bell Labs in New Jersey ran a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similar experiment, with the same result. No explanation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has ever been found-until now, perhaps. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris suggests that, instead of ejecting the electrons, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light boosted them from the ground state to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dumb-bell-shaped excited state, and the electron bubbles
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;split. &quot;There were more bubbles, and being smaller they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were more mobile,&quot; says Maris. Although the total charge
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the system remained the same, the smaller bubbles felt
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less drag in the helium, and thus moved faster.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Consequently, the current went up,&quot; Maris explains. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris believes he has further evidence to support his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explanation. Northby and Sanders saw the increased
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current only below 1.7 kelvin, exactly the temperature at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which Maris's theory says the effect should take hold.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to his calculations, electron bubbles should split
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apart only below a critical temperature of 1.7 K. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crucial factor is viscosity. If it is too great, says Maris, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liquid will behave like treacle, resisting the elongation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bubble and squeezing it back to a sphere. Below
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.19K liquid helium becomes a superfluid: as you cool it,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its viscosity starts to disappear. By 1.7 K, Maris
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculated, the liquid would be so slippery that it couldn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop the bubbles dividing. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other experimenters have studied the mobility of electrons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a more precise way. They include Gary Ihas and Mike
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanders at the University of Michigan in 1971 and Van
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eden and McClintock of the University of Lancaster in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1984. These physicists created a short burst of about a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;million bubbles which they carefully timed as they moved
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through liquid helium in an electric field. Since the bubbles
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were created together, they should have crossed the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finishing line together. To the surprise of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experimenters, most of the bubbles arrived in three
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate clumps. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris's explanation is again simple. Unlike the electrons
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Minnesota experiment, these electrons had been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;created in an electrical discharge-a miniature bolt of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lightning. This produced light, and Maris says that some of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this light boosted electrons within the bubbles to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excited state, causing them to split, and split again. Hence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the spread of arrival times, with whole, half and quarter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charges making up most of the current. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;McClintock is not yet convinced by Maris. But he admits
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that nobody else has come up with a plausible
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explanation. &quot;The electrino idea offers a possible way
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out,&quot; he concedes. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris has long realised the furore his ideas would cause.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spent several years working out the details of electron
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bubble fission and gathering experimental evidence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without ever telling anyone what he was thinking. &quot;It took
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time to get used to the idea and pluck up the courage to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;announce it,&quot; he admits. Finally, in June this year, he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decided to go public. He presented his work at a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minneapolis conference on quantum fluids and solids, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then published it in a paper in the Journal of Low
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temperature Physics (vol 120, p 173). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference organisers thought Maris's work important
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to give him an extra two-hour session. At the end,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than 100 physicists questioned every aspect of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theory. &quot;My first reaction was extreme scepticism, like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone else,&quot; McClintock says. Maris, though, had an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer for everything. &quot;He'd obviously thought long and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard about the whole thing,&quot; McClintock concedes. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris was encouraged by the response -or lack of it-from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his peers. &quot;I was nervous someone would find a hole,&quot; he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;admits. &quot;But to my relief nobody dismissed the idea out of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts in quantum theory are not so accommodating,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though. &quot;The idea of an electron splitting into fractionally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charged fragments is totally incompatible with quantum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field theory,&quot; says Anthony Leggett of the University of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He admits that there could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be something wrong with quantum field theory. &quot;However,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given its overwhelming success in explaining the world,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is highly unlikely,&quot; he says. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to quantum theory, it is possible to have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strange &quot;superposition states&quot;, where the whole electron
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exists in both bubbles until a measurement forces it to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in one or the other. &quot;But we cannot consider states which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have half an electron on each,&quot; Leggett insists. It is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impossible to solve the equations of quantum mechanics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with anything other than a whole-charge electron. The
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formulations of quantum electrodynamics, the area of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics that deals with the behaviour and properties of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electrons, don't allow for half electrons, or any other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fraction. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If the electron splits and you can measure a fractional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge, this flies in the face of standard quantum
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mechanics as well as high-energy physics,&quot; agrees David
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pritchard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The idea that the electron is a point particle without
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;structure is established up to very high energies.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half measures
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Leggett and Pritchard, most physicists are convinced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Maris's claim falls at the first fence, though they cannot
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pinpoint why. Their scepticism is understandable. If Maris
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is right then quantum theory is wrong-and nobody has the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slightest idea what they would use to replace it. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris being right would have some positive practical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences, however. He speculates about building a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;device which introduces a partition into a cavity to divide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wave function of an electron. This could lead to circuits
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which exploit the properties of fractionally charged
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particles, he says. Half-mass, half-charge electrons might
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give electronics a whole new dimension. Then there's the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possibility of a new kind of chemistry. Maybe you could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take an electron bubble out of the liquid, attach the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electron fragment to an atom and do novel chemistry with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fractional electrons. Could this really happen? Maris says
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he doesn't know. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The electron fragments, having once been part of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same electron, might even be &quot;entangled&quot;, sharing a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strange telepathic link. Quantum physicists have already
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;managed to achieve this with photons, and used these
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entangled particles of light to perform astonishing feats
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as teleportation and elementary quantum computing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fractional charge might add a new string to their bow. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most profound consequences of splitting the electron,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though, would be on theoretical physics. Maris's only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concrete claim is that an electron's wave function can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;split and mimic a fractional electron. He has no idea of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full consequences of this-and neither has anyone else.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris's hypothesis seems to throw everything we know
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about quantum theory into confusion. At the very least, he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believes, his work challenges physicists to be specific
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about what they mean by the fuzzy entity that describes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quantum systems. &quot;People are going to have to hone their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ideas of the wave function,&quot; he says. &quot;Most importantly,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are going to have to address the question: what is a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wave function? Is it a real thing, or just a mathematical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convenience?&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Physicists have always been content to think of the wave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function as a mathematical device with observable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences. But Maris believes the time has come for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the idea to be grounded in reality. For the electron
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bubbles in helium, he says, the size of the bubble is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determined by how much of the wave function is trapped
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the bubble. If there is no part of the wave function
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the bubble, the bubble will collapse. &quot;This makes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wave function seem to be a tangible object,&quot; he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;argues. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maris remains an experimentalist at heart, though. Since
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the theorists have nothing to say about the myriad
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;questions he has raised, he believes answers won't be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found until there is some more evidence to go on-and that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means doing more experiments. Maris and others, he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believes, are now looking for that evidence. &quot;Already, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results of my experiments are encouraging,&quot; he says. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Maris also insists that he won't be upset if his idea is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventually disproved. Having lobbed in his bombshell, he
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ensuing chaos. &quot;What I have come up with is an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intriguing puzzle,&quot; he says. &quot;I want people to think. I would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be happy if I was completely wrong but made a lot of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people think.&quot;
