-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
<br>
Hash: SHA1
<br>
<p>Per the suggestion of the Web page for this mailing list, I'm sending 
<br>
out a join message, in total disregard for modesty and normal e-mail 
<br>
manners.  Thus, there will be no apology for the pimping that ensues 
<br>
below.
<br>
<p>Firstly, I admit that I'm a senior in high school who has read his 
<br>
fair share of science fiction and am an accomplished hacker, having 
<br>
written several programs half asleep and all in one sitting.  I know 
<br>
a lot (certainly more than the average person), but I'm humble (but 
<br>
not modest :-)) enough to admit that there is a lot more for me to 
<br>
learn.
<br>
<p>I've made it to high SL4 because, for whatever reason, once I believe 
<br>
something is possible that is the same thing, for me, as accepting it 
<br>
as something that will happen and become bored with it once I learn 
<br>
about it.  That is why I like to read fantasy, too, since it is 
<br>
impossible and can get me excited.
<br>
<p>I have OCD, but be glad.  It is probably the best thing ever, since 
<br>
it makes me think differently and have a different (okay, better) 
<br>
perspective on everything.
<br>
<p>I am a master of Tetris.  I'm probably one of the best players of the 
<br>
game on the planet and have logged hundreds of hours playing the game 
<br>
in various forms.  It is a form of meditation, where I can think 
<br>
about other things while keeping the physical parts of me focused on 
<br>
playing the game.
<br>
<p>I bring with me a knowledge of linguistics, AI, the depths of 
<br>
Macintosh history and culture (in other words, I can r00t y0|_|Rz M@&lt; 
<br>
anytime ;-)), and the ability to type almost as quickly as I can 
<br>
think (which is pretty fast).
<br>
<p>Oh, and I am, of course, the sexiest guy on the planet.
<br>
<p>I've left lots of stuff out just because it's late, and I can't 
<br>
remember everything.  Plus, some stuff would seem modest, so I'm not 
<br>
going to include it.
<br>
<p>If I wasn't unmodest enough, flame me and I'll come back once I think 
<br>
of some less modest things to write.
