<em>&gt; &gt; Sometimes....  Surely, I know some very intelligent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose supergoals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are the same as those of much less intelligent people (Beer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; T&amp;A, ...  ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I wanted to avoid bringing this up, since it does sometimes creep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people out, but I don't drink, do drugs, smoke, fight, have sex, overeat,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or gamble.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.  I can sort of sympathize with everything except the sex part.  I
<br>
don't drink or
<br>
take drugs much, although I do enjoy both on occasion.  Fighting and
<br>
overeating
<br>
aren't really all that much fun, nor is gambling, though I did a very little
<br>
bit of it when
<br>
I lived in Vegas, because it was there.
<br>
<p>I don't think I'm going to quiz you about your sex life or lack thereof in
<br>
this forum,
<br>
but it is surely a puzzler....
<br>
<p>Did you know that in Taoist Yoga,  it is taught that if you hold in your
<br>
sperm for your
<br>
whole life, you can achieve immortality.  The sperm germinates inside of you
<br>
until it forms
<br>
some kind of cosmic fetus which gives rise to another you, emanating out of
<br>
your head....
<br>
<p>I don't believe it, actually.  But if it is true, I'll never find out, but
<br>
maybe you will!
<br>
I'll have to count on immortality through more modern technology instead ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another way of looking at it is that all actual decisions, as in the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that eventually get sent to motor control, are made by verbal thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>This is just not true... but I don't think it's crucial to your point...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;From this perspective, the ability to do a verbal override is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily an evolutionary advantage.  It is an inevitable consequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our underlying cognitive architecture.  Our cognitive architecture is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge evolutionary advantage compared to nonconsciousness; thus, remaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neanderthal is not an option.  But, from the genes' perspectives, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first conscious architecture that happened to arise, while crushing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neanderthals, has its own problems.  Such as allowing verbal overrides -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore, memetic overrides - of the built-in desires.  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;problem&quot; from the perspective of the genes, anyway.
</em><br>
<p>I understand your view, I think ... but I think it's wrong.
<br>
<p>Culture makes us smarter and more adaptable, so genes that lead to culture
<br>
should
<br>
be selected, and they are
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I regard none of this as a factor in my picture of how a mind *should*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.
</em><br>
<p>Well, our evolutionary heritage has many  minusses, e.g. the dark aspects of
<br>
sexuality
<br>
(jealousy, etc.); aggression; etc.
<br>
<p>But I was noting one plus: it integrates relatively useful goal systems all
<br>
through our
<br>
minds in subtle &amp; complex ways.
<br>
<p>If Ai systems don't evolve, they'll have to get this some other way, that's
<br>
all.  It's far from
<br>
impossible.
