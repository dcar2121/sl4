<p>Yes, I thought you'd say that.  :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So while the Minskyites might make problems for themselves, I can't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the when-subgoals-attack problem applying to either the CaTAI class of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; architectures, or to the transhuman level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand the CaTAI architecture well enough to form a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterargument.  But in general, I think that if you can't forget goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but remember the subgoals they spawned, you're going to have a hellacious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory problem in your system.  You can't assume infinite memory, as you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find out when you actually start building CaTAI...
</em><br>
<p>The counterargument for CaTAI is the same as the counterargument for
<br>
humans - that we are unified minds and that our subgoals don't have
<br>
independent volition.  When was the last time your mind was taken over by
<br>
your auditory cortex?  Maybe you once had a tune you couldn't get out of
<br>
your head, but there's a difference between a subprocess exhibiting
<br>
behavior you don't like, and hypothesizing that a subprocess will exhibit
<br>
conscious volitional decision-making.  The auditory cortex may annoy you
<br>
but it cannot plot against you; it has a what-it-does, not a will.
<br>
<p>One counterargument for transhumans is that it does not take &quot;infinite&quot;
<br>
memory to retain supergoal context, just the stardard amount of memory
<br>
required for a Friendliness system, and thus you can have an ecology of
<br>
perfectly cooperative processes united by a shared set of supergoals.
<br>
<p>*The* counterargument for transhumans is that the whole idea of identity
<br>
and identifying is itself an anthropomorphism.  Why aren't we worried that
<br>
the transhuman's goal system will break off and decide to take over,
<br>
instead of being subservient to the complete entity?  Why aren't we
<br>
worried about individual functions developing self-awareness and deciding
<br>
to serve themselves instead of a whole?  You can keep breaking it down,
<br>
finer and finer, until at the end single bytes are identifying with
<br>
themselves instead of the group... something that would require around a
<br>
trillion percent overhead, speaking of infinite memory.
<br>
<p>And, speaking of cultural relativism:  For minds-in-general, *who you
<br>
identify with* is an arbitrary proposition.  It's just humans, who have
<br>
very sharp cognitive boundaries between &quot;inside of me&quot; and &quot;outside of
<br>
me&quot;, who (a) automatically identify with &quot;myself&quot; and (b) have the
<br>
*capability* of identifying with a clearly defined &quot;myself&quot;.  A transhuman
<br>
subprocess might as easily say &quot;I am a goal system&quot; as &quot;I am a transhuman
<br>
subprocess&quot; or &quot;I am a transhuman&quot;.  The answer is not any one of the
<br>
three; the answer is MU, literally no-thing; a Sysop and a Sysop
<br>
sub-process does not &quot;identify&quot; with anything at all.  It is simply
<br>
Friendly.  It has no need to know its &quot;identity&quot; or its &quot;group membership&quot;
<br>
as a determinant of which side it should be on; it is simply Friendly,
<br>
regardless.  The whole idea that who you identify with necessarily has
<br>
something to do with your goals is itself an anthropomorphism.
<br>
<p>The real answer, then, is that neither the Sysop nor its subprocesses have
<br>
a need to distinguish between being a subprocess and being a Sysop.  It,
<br>
or they, are simply Friendly.
