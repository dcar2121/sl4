</em><br>
<p>Sexuality never had the supergoal of procreation; rather, it is a
<br>
historical fact that sexual people reproduced more often in the ancestral
<br>
environment, and therefore modern-day humans are sexual.  The &quot;supergoal&quot;
<br>
of procreation was never represented explicitly in the human mind; it is
<br>
simply a historical fact about why sexuality used to be an evolutionary
<br>
advantage.  (Though procreation was also embedded as an *independent*
<br>
instinct, since people who liked children and wanted to have children were
<br>
more likely to have them and treat them well...)
<br>
<p>You can't generalize from here to assuming that, say, my deciding to cross
<br>
the street will take over from wanting to get to the restaurant, and that
<br>
I'll keep on crossing and crossing and crossing and never get to the
<br>
restaurant...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sometimes the subgoal should take over for the goal.  If your goal is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write a book, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a subgoal of this is to solve a certain intellectual problem, you may find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out that the problem
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; project and devote yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only to the problem.  The subgoal then replaces its supergoal as a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving the supersupergoal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of amusing oneself, stimulating one's mind, or whatever...
</em><br>
<p>I would not call an intermediate goal a supergoal - that term should be
<br>
reserved strictly for the top layer.  Rather, a layer-3 subgoal turns out
<br>
to be more important than the layer-2 subgoal, under - and this is the key
<br>
point - the ultimate arbitration of the layer-1 supergoal.  The L3 subgoal
<br>
turns out to be useful not just for the particular L2 subgoal that spawned
<br>
it, but for another, higher-priority L2 subgoal, or perhaps even an L1
<br>
supergoal.  You can't necessarily extrapolate from an L3 subgoal
<br>
overthrowing an L2 subgoal to conclude that an L2 subgoal can overthrow an
<br>
L1 supergoal.
<br>
<p>In a sense, there are no layers and there are no subgoals; there are
<br>
simply supergoals, models of reality, and decisions.  The &quot;subgoal&quot; is
<br>
simply a convenient abstraction which saves us the trouble of remembering,
<br>
on every occasion, that we are writing chapter 3 in order to finish the
<br>
book in order to get paid in order to eat, et cetera, and let us
<br>
concentrate simply on finishing chapter 3.  The human mind decidedly lacks
<br>
automatic instantaneous change propagation, so it's quite possible that we
<br>
would blindly go on writing chapter 3 even if a supergoal changed -
<br>
acting, if you'll pardon the phrase, like machines.
<br>
<p>But the amount of cognition that can be devoted to checking higher levels
<br>
of the goal chain changes, depending on how large the decision is.  It's a
<br>
bad idea to reconduct the self-examination of whether you really like
<br>
family Christmas get-togethers every time you decide where to carve the
<br>
turkey; that higher-level decision can be cached.  But it's not such a bad
<br>
idea to reconduct the self-examination once a year, and at that time, it
<br>
may be appropriate to check whether the original reason (higher-level
<br>
subgoal) of bonding with your family still retains its previous value.
<br>
<p>Now, after all that, I'll also turn around and say that, in the human
<br>
mind, a subgoal can overthrow a supergoal!  There are at least three
<br>
different human subsystems that could be labeled as &quot;supergoal&quot;:  The
<br>
conscious beliefs about concrete goals that determine our conscious
<br>
decisions, the evolved instincts that determine how we feel about it, and
<br>
the philosophical beliefs that determine how we should choose goal
<br>
systems.  All of these systems affect all the other systems, so it's quite
<br>
possible for a subgoal to alter a philosophical belief which in turn
<br>
alters a concrete goal that happens to be the parent of the original
<br>
subgoal.  And since change propagation in the human goal system occurs
<br>
relatively slowly compared to the speed of conscious thought, it's
<br>
possible for absurdities to occur within the system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, a single byte is not really capable of containing a self-model and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes for maintaining this self-model.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's why the trillion percent overhead - each byte requires a
<br>
10-gig mind to look after that byte's interest... unless, of course, the
<br>
process is recursive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do believe that &quot;alienated subgoals&quot; are an inevitable part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, but I also suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this phenomenon can be reduced to a much lower level than we see in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human mind, in a transhuman AI.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as long as you also suspect that this phenomenon being reduced to a
<br>
&quot;much lower level&quot; will result in qualitatively different behavior, it
<br>
might be sufficiently nonanthropomorphic to get by...
