</em><br>
<p>Hello!
<br>
<p>(I just joined this list)
<br>
<p>Obviously, I can't comment on this film, since ILM is working on the 
<br>
effects. Remember that Kubrick made 2001 and had Marvin Minsky consult
<br>
I think. 2001 might seem like a &quot;con&quot; movie, but it is actually a very
<br>
serious film about AI. More serious than any other movie I can think of
<br>
off the top of my head (despite what anyone might think, I'm not a film 
<br>
buff).
<br>
<p>This might be too much of a blurred memory for me to get this right, but
<br>
when I was taking &quot;The Society of Mind&quot;, years ago, Minsky was saying 
<br>
something about the obelisk-thing being a dodecahedron or something 
<br>
instead of a big box (1x4x9). But Stanley had protested that that a
<br>
&quot;dodecahedron&quot; would be far too inaccessible for the general public, so 
<br>
the big box it was. Despite this seemingly low opinion of the average 
<br>
intelligence of the masses, he did make a thought provoking film (IMHO).
<br>
(Did anyone read the book. Did I completely invent this memory?)
<br>
<p>Now as for the film that I can't comment on: I was so worried they were
<br>
going to get this completely wrong, but from a couple things I've
<br>
heard about, it might not be that bad. In fact, I'm a bit intrigued 
<br>
now. I couldn't decide if I wanted to work on it because I didn't
<br>
want to be associated with it if I hated it, since I take these 
<br>
issues very seriously. I've already made my decision and I'm working
<br>
on a different project. I don't think they'll get everything right, 
<br>
but I actually want to see the movie now. 
<br>
<p>As a general self observation: I've come to realize that the small 
<br>
segments of films that I do see don't really help me determine if I'm 
<br>
going to like the movie or not. 
<br>
<p>It's just too bad that I can't speculate on the &quot;pro&quot; vs. &quot;con&quot; thing,
<br>
you'll just have to wait and see for yourself ;^) If you search the
<br>
net, though, you'll find the story that the movie is roughly (and I
<br>
do mean roughly) based upon.
<br>
<p>Once it comes out, I'm sure there will be lots of discussion about
<br>
the topic. Which could be &quot;a good thing&quot;. Maybe some enterprising
<br>
9 year old will see the movie, whip out a version of flare and 
<br>
kick off the seed AI before the end of next year :) Then we can
<br>
ask the AI, if it liked the movie.
