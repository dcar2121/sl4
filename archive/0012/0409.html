<p>This discussion has lead me to an interesting question:  how Friendly 
<br>
can a hive mind be?  Personally, I don't think I would want to become 
<br>
part of a hive mind, but if other people want to I'm generally okay 
<br>
with it.  From this discussion, though, I'm thinking that the hive 
<br>
mind could have lots of conflicts in it and never have a good level 
<br>
of Friendliness.
<br>
<p>Firstly, I'm looking at hive minds not in the sense of lots of wet 
<br>
ware that at one time was an individual processes but has given 
<br>
itself up to the hive so that it no longer has its own identity; it 
<br>
is just a powerful processor.  I'm looking at them in the sense that 
<br>
individuals come into a commune of sorts to share a global 
<br>
conscienceness that the observers outside the hive see but inside the 
<br>
hive contains individual processes that are in conflict with each 
<br>
other, even though they are helping to create the global 
<br>
conscienceness.  The factor of disagreement will be very high in some 
<br>
cases, so much so that Friendliness will break down as the minds go 
<br>
to civil war, causing the hive conscienceness to suffer.  If the hive 
<br>
mind became un Friendly enough, the universe could be in for some 
<br>
rough times.
<br>
<p>One factor that could make this issue moot is the speed of the hive's 
<br>
thinking.  For example, in MacLeod's /The Cassini Division/, there is 
<br>
a hive mind on Jupiter that is in serious conflict with the human 
<br>
society around it.  Before the humans decide if they should destroy 
<br>
the hive or not, they contact them to see what they are like and if 
<br>
they are still dangerous (they are, since they like to take over the 
<br>
minds of humans and use them as puppets, if only the humans in the 
<br>
story didn't develop such good protections against such activities). 
<br>
In the talks, it turns out that the hive is very fast, but not 
<br>
Singularity fast, since at one point a question about something or 
<br>
other is asked and, while usually responses come immediately, there 
<br>
was a few second delay.  For the fast folk of the hive, this time was 
<br>
like years to us.  During that time, they were having it out over how 
<br>
the hive would respond.  In the end, the hive comes to a response and 
<br>
nothing really bad happens.  So, then, if the hive can argue really 
<br>
quickly, would it loose Friendliness for a short enough period of 
<br>
time not to matter to the rest of the universe?  And how does this 
<br>
change when more of us are faster (i.e. some sort of trans or 
<br>
posthuman)?
