<em>&gt; I'm not sure I follow.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People who gamble made an act of volition.  Surely we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should offer them more gambling opportunities, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gambling is obviously what they want, and according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eli: 'People should get what they want'?
</em><br>
<p>Michael has made his point very clearly and convincingly:
<br>
<p>&quot;Most of the people who lose money in 
<br>
Vegas do not have huge salaries - they are the multitudes of working 
<br>
middle-class people who come to Vegas just to have a little &quot;fun&quot;.  But 
<br>
they are hopelessly clueless about statistics, addicted to the rush of 
<br>
gambling, and it is straightforward for the casinos to coax away their 
<br>
life savings, resulting in their long-term suffering. &quot;
<br>
<p>To concentrate on the present act of volition made by the gambler when
<br>
he gambles and ignore the frustration of his future volitions is not
<br>
warranted by the volitional morality in which you rest your case. Sure,
<br>
I want to go to the casino. But I also want, as a person who exists over
<br>
time, to have medical attention, to send my kids to college, or to buy a
<br>
better house. All these volitions are frustrated by my acting upon the
<br>
gambling volition. When an agent has inconsistent preferences --as all
<br>
gamblers who share basic human desires and whose gamble-to-wealth ratio
<br>
exceeds a certain amount are--, you can't simply take one of them as a
<br>
sign that that is what the agent truly wants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Both prostitutes and their clients are engaging in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volitional consensual actions.  Surely we should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aiming to set up harems all over the place,  since sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is obviously what they and according to Eli: 'People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should get what they want'?
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't follow at all from Eliezer's maxim (which I share) that we
<br>
&quot;should be aiming to set up harems all over the place&quot;. An unattractive,
<br>
compulsive, and smelling 55 year-old is clearly *not* what prostitutes
<br>
want. A better description of the situation is to say that they are
<br>
*forced by the circumstances* they find themselves in to sell their body
<br>
in the marketplace so that they can earn a living. What we volitionists
<br>
should be aiming at is to set a framework where no woman finds herself
<br>
in such a desperate situation. If prostitution still emerges *then*, I'm
<br>
all for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, if we believe volitional morality we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all become drug dealers, because there's a huge demand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for hard drugs, a serious lack of supply, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to Eli:  'People should get what they want'?
</em><br>
<p>Ought implies can. People can't get what they want if they have
<br>
contradictory &quot;wants&quot;. As Isaiah Berlin once said, &quot;a contradiction
<br>
cannot be conceived, let alone exist&quot;. Thus, the Eliezerean maxim must
<br>
not be understood in such a narrow way. What people should get is,
<br>
rather, what they MOST want.
<br>
<p>Pablo
