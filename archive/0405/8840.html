</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Genetic engineering can probably help minimise certain 
<br>
aspects of our genetic heritage that interfere with the attainment of 
<br>
wisdom, such as tendency of fight-or-flight mechanisms to make us act 
<br>
stupid, tendency to fall into depressive and obsessive patterns, etc. 
<br>
Perhaps simply widespread use of technologies to minimize such 
<br>
behavioural flaws (including genetic engineering) will have the 
<br>
effect of raising the ambient wisdom level significantly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think many human beings on earth, through a combination 
<br>
of learned self-control and behaviour patterns, have learnt to limit 
<br>
the effect of such problems. Real wisdom, however, is still difficult.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have technologies for creating wisdom, such as 
<br>
universities. Such technologies are still hit and miss, advancement 
<br>
has slowed, and seem unlikely to make a quantum leap in efficiency 
<br>
any time soon.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe we will work out clever techniques to make sure our AIs 
<br>
are wise (as well as smart and friendly). I doubt we are going to do 
<br>
it with people anytime soon.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards Jefs wise point about an increase in wisdom 
<br>
arising from an increase in group function - I think its no accident 
<br>
that those problems that interfere with wisdom (anger, depression, 
<br>
obsession, etc) also interfere with working in groups.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, me too. I have even less faith in genetic engineering to do so.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unlike sociocultural change, I have very little

confidence that genetic engineering is practically able to do so much 
<br>
at all, whereas sociocultural change, while hit and miss and a 
<br>
frighteningly slow process, does appear to slowly (and far from

surely) head in mostly the right direction.
