<p>Hmmm..
<br>
<p>I don't want to encourage this sort of thread, which is tiresome to me
<br>
and probably to most readers of this list, but if you're going to make
<br>
personal comments about me I suppose I will briefly respond.  I won't
<br>
mind at all if you DON'T respond to this message and thus bring the
<br>
thread to an end.
<br>
<p>First of all: Interestingly, Eliezer, I also feel that I understand the
<br>
issues relative to FAI much better than you do.  
<br>
<p>Although I do recognize that you have spent a higher percentage of your
<br>
recent time thinking about FAI specifically rather than AGI in general,
<br>
and I have a lot of respect for your intelligence, I've come to feel
<br>
that your thinking on the topic is hampered by your strong emotional
<br>
attachment to certain philosophies.
<br>
<p>As for my &quot;drive&quot;, anyone who knows me in real life would affirm that I
<br>
have abundances of energy and drive.  Not working hard enough and not
<br>
pushing hard enough are not among my flaws.  You can reasonably question
<br>
my strategy and tactics (I reconsider them all the time!) but not my
<br>
drive.
<br>
<p>As for my &quot;relaxed attitude on life&quot; -- yah, although I work and think
<br>
very hard, I generally enjoy myself and try not to take everything too
<br>
seriously.  That doesn't mean I'd push my kids in front of a bus, nor
<br>
that I'd launch an evil AI.  I think your understanding of my psychology
<br>
is sufficiently limited that you should refrain from publicly
<br>
speculating about it ;-)
<br>
