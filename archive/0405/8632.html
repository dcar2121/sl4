Keith,

<em>&gt; &quot;If we could deliberately seize control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our pleasure systems, we could reproduce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure of success without the need for any
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end of everything.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the references.  Of course such primitive changes are not what I
<br>
have in mind.  Indeed, I am not even tempted by the contemplation of such a
<br>
wirehead-like existence.  I do not value my momentary personal pleasure
<br>
above all other things.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And after you have removed your basic drives just
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;This is a straw man, Keith.  You bought up 'removal of basic drives'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, you did, or at least you did if you consider eating a basic drive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree that eating (hunger, need for nourishment) is a basic drive, but my
<br>
reference to  a straw man was that you wrote about *removal* of the drive,
<br>
whereas I wrote about *dialing down* the drive.  I agree that removal of a
<br>
basic drive would almost certainly lead to unfortunate consequences (unless
<br>
one desired to have one's entire brain virtually rewritten).  For the more
<br>
moderate changes to be able to proceed with a reasonable amount of safety,
<br>
there would still need to be a high level of understanding about how such
<br>
changes might affect the being they are made upon.  Of course there is risk
<br>
in every action, but with proper safeguards and backups at various stages,
<br>
there is no reason to believe that changing ourselves would lead to our
<br>
doom.  I rather suspect that leaving ourselves *un*changed would lead to our
<br>
doom.
