</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
An important concept, or view, appears to be absent from this 
<br>
discussion.  It is that increasingly, wisdom and decisions of large 
<br>
import are the result of group thinking.  This goes beyond the obvious 
<br>
intentional collaboration on group issues that is fairly well 
<br>
recognized, especially in today's business world, as necessary for 
<br>
success.  It consists also, in ways that are more subtle and pervasive, 
<br>
in the shared access to global knowledge and opinion via the media, and 
<br>
in the indirect effects of immersion in a common economy and social 
<br>
structure.  All of these lead to an effective intelligence (resulting in 
<br>
decisions and actions) greater than any individual human.
<br>
<p>This is difficult for many of us to see, especially in the West, because 
<br>
we are steeped in the illusion of Self as some kind of discrete entity.  
<br>
And so we naturally think in terms of enhancing this Self, or creating a 
<br>
greater Self to guide us.  It's not so much that these viewpoints are 
<br>
wrong, but that they are incomplete and miss the bigger picture that we 
<br>
don't operate alone, and that increasingly, it is the human matrix 
<br>
(including culture, but also the shared infrastructure, values, economic 
<br>
and social ties, etc.) that has the power to affect change.  [Some may 
<br>
feel an uncomfortable reaction at this point, a signal that it may be 
<br>
useful to look deeper and ask why.]
<br>
<p>A related concept, I refer to it as the Arrow of Morality, says that as 
<br>
our access to information grows, and as our interdependence grows, our 
<br>
decisions naturally and necessarily become increasingly moral overall 
<br>
(from the point of view of the larger organization, and secondarily from 
<br>
the point of view of its members).
<br>
<p>If we accept the above, and that we are now entering an inflection point 
<br>
of human development, we may want to contribute to this process in a way 
<br>
that minimizes the pain of change and adaptation for humanity.  Helping 
<br>
to create an effective infrastructure for global knowledge sharing, 
<br>
creating devices and methods to facilitate access to information, tools 
<br>
for collaborative efforts and decision making are all ways that those of 
<br>
us with technological inclinations can contribute to creating an 
<br>
effectively more intelligent human society to carry us through this 
<br>
phase of our development.
