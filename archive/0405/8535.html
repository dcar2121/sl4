<p>How do you know that his current actions are not in line with his future
<br>
temporal preferences? Answer, you don't, except in most unusual
<br>
circumstances. These problems arise from the fact that while our computing
<br>
capacity is quite high, the bandwidth we have of communicating with other
<br>
people is rather low. This means that a great portion of our world view
<br>
(and thus motivations) will be hidden from all other people, no matter
<br>
what we want.
<br>
<p>For example gambling has several positive aspects. It allows a rational
<br>
agent to change the probability distribution of his money, especially to
<br>
make the variance greater or smaller while keeping the average the same
<br>
(not counting the service fee that casino takes).
<br>
<p>Because from the outside we cannot know if the reasons a person is doing
<br>
something are good and right, on any such individual action, making laws
<br>
that prohibit them is a very bad idea.
<br>
<p><p>Of course, people can and do have very bad ideas of what is good and
<br>
right. Those with bad ideas tend to make bad decisions and would benefit
<br>
the most from better ideas.
