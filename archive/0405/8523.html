Dear SL4;
<br>
<p>Prompted by Michael Anissimov's recent post &quot;American Humanists Association
<br>
2004 conference report - complete!&quot; and the replies to it...
<br>
<p>I would like to comment on volitional morality, particularly in reference to
<br>
the actions of: drug consumption (drinking), risk taking (gambling),
<br>
hedonism (binging) and commercial exchange (profiting).
<br>
<p>In Western society the default mental models of all these ideas involve
<br>
voluntary actions.  From the point of view of volitional morality, it is
<br>
erroneous to classify voluntary actions by volitional beings as morally
<br>
negative if the action does not effect anyone else.  To the extent that an
<br>
action does effect others, there can be a judgment of moral value by
<br>
identifying what the effects are, and how others evaluate those effects.
<br>
<p>In plain language:
<br>
<p>* Actions that effect ourselves alone are morally neutral.
<br>
* Actions that effect others in a way they disapprove are morally negative.
<br>
* Actions that effect others in a way they do not care about are morally
<br>
neutral.
<br>
* Actions that effect others in a way they approve are morally positive.
<br>
<p>It is only possible to have a morally negative or positive action when it
<br>
effects others.  This implies that volitional morality has something to say
<br>
about actions as they effect others, but nothing to say about actions in and
<br>
of themselves.
<br>
<p>Adhering to volitional morality would seem to require that individuals'
<br>
choices effecting themselves alone to be respected.  Even, or perhaps
<br>
*especially* when the choices are not those that the person standing in
<br>
moral judgment would make.  Additionally it would seem that it is erroneous
<br>
to classify voluntary transactions between volitional beings as morally
<br>
negative, as long as the transactions effect only the parties involved.
<br>
<p>In reference to specific situations, it would follow that:
<br>
<pre>
---
* Drug consumption is morally neutral. (eg. drinking alcohol).
* Drug consumption followed by actions that put others at risk without their
permission is morally negative. (eg. drinking and driving).
* Drug consumption followed by actions that benefit others is morally
positive. (eg. coffee for air-traffic controllers)
* Risk taking is morally neutral. (eg. playing poker for money)
* Risking the lives of others without their approval is morally negative.
(eg. Playing 'Chicken' with a loaded school bus)
* Risking the money of others with their approval is morally positive. (eg.
Stock broker)
* Hedonism is morally neutral. (eg. binging on choco-chip ice-cream)
* Hedonism that negatively effects others is morally wrong. (eg. Having a
massage &amp; pedicure instead of chairing the board meeting)
* Hedonism that positively effects others is morally positive. (eg. Having a
massage &amp; pedicure on a day off)
* Commercial exchange cannot be morally neutral (AFAIK) because commercial
exchange does not occur unless there is a perceived benefit.
* Commercial exchange that is forced is morally wrong. (eg. monopoly
situations)
* Commercial exchange that is free is morally positive. (eg. garage sales,
street sales)

There is more to say about volitional morality than can be fit into a short
post. (Eg: <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0309/7097.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0309/7097.html</a>)  Especially pertinent is
the aspect of informational availability - how much a being knows about
something affects their opinions and decision.  Therefore how much
information should be gathered before coming to a decision?  Also there is
the puzzle of intelligence differential.  How would the application of
volitional morality work out when beings of vastly different intelligence
interact?  Important stuff, worth discussing!
