<p>This is the wrong type of thinking. We're not trying to guess what will
<br>
happen in an unconstrained system given certain inputs, because this is
<br>
essentially impossible for anything even approaching the complexity of
<br>
seed AI. Computers are deterministic systems and making probabilistic
<br>
guesses about things that have never been done is usually indicative of
<br>
an attempt to generalise without a sound basis for assessing the
<br>
confidence of that generalisation.
<br>
<p>The correct mode of thinking is to constrain the behaviour of the system
<br>
so that it is theoretically impossible for it to leave the class of states
<br>
that you define as desireable. This is still hideously difficult, as
<br>
defining 'classes of states' is really hard and you need multiple
<br>
overlapping safeguards to compensate for likely implementation errors,
<br>
but it is at least not doomed from the word go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My statement is that, so far as I know, it's reasonably likely that

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Without a deep understanding of the cognitive architecture, you have no
<br>
way of knowing whether you are 'teaching' the system what you think you
<br>
are teaching it. If you /do/ have a deep understanding of the architecture,
<br>
then you don't teach, you specify (though you if you don't understand what
<br>
you're trying to teach you might have to specify the consequences and get
<br>
the AGI to work out what the axioms are). From what I understand of your
<br>
design, you will be trying to form a distributed semi-causal goal system
<br>
via subgoaling of reinforcer-based supergoals. The result would be zero,
<br>
wrong and/or incomprehensible generalisation of the subgoals followed by
<br>
an indeterminate self-modifcation trajectory possibly resulting in subgoal
<br>
stomp and arbitrary behaviour or possibly just tiling the solar system
<br>
with smiley faces. I would say we might get lucky and it would just wirehead,
<br>
but I get the impression you'd just hack the structure a bit and rerun the
<br>
takeoff until planetkill occurs.
<br>
<p>Social training is an empathic process that works on other humans (and to
<br>
a lesser extent, other vertebrates) because of shared brainware. You can
<br>
select actions which probalistic but mainly favourable consequences because
<br>
you can model the other person. Neither this nor experience of training
<br>
trivial connectionist networks or setting fitness functions in tiny GAs is
<br>
applicable to the problem of teaching an AGI morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wouldn't advocate proceeding to create a superhuman-level self-modifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI without a better understanding.
</em><br>
<p>Commendable, but are you sure that you have enough understanding not to do
<br>
it by accident?
