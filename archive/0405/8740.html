<p>Well I do have some reasons for my claims, but it's
<br>
mainly just intuition at this point ;)
<br>
<p>There's too much cockiness from Eliezer.  I'm tired of
<br>
it.  In fact there's any number of people who are far
<br>
too sure of themselves for my tastes.
<br>
<p>Just recently Eliezer agreed that the Singularity
<br>
should not be defined as a prediction horizon - that
<br>
there's an abstract humanly understandable invariant
<br>
behind Friendliness.  I could have told him that 2
<br>
years ago.  I actually said as much on wta-talk
<br>
several times.
<br>
<p>Now he's worried about what constitutes a 'Person'. 
<br>
Again, he should have been thinking about that from
<br>
the start.
<br>
<p>You should be aware that many times in the past when
<br>
my intuition has come up against the hypothesis of
<br>
ultra-smart genuies (which I have taken to calling
<br>
'aca-dummies') , the hypothesis of the ultra-smart
<br>
genuies always without fail ended up falsified.  In a
<br>
one-on-one contest between my intution and the
<br>
thoughts of people like Eliezer and Ben, I bet on my
<br>
intuition.  I'm confident that my intution will crush
<br>
Eliezer and Ben, just like it did all of the other
<br>
aca-dummmies that came up against me.
<br>
<p>No one has ever seen a general intelligence that lacks
<br>
consciousness, lacks a self node, is totally
<br>
altruistic etc etc.  Who is to say that such a thing
<br>
is possible at all?  My intuition keeps yelling to me
<br>
that something is suspect here.  Something is fishy
<br>
here.  Something is 'out of kilter' here.  That's all
<br>
I'm saying at the moment.
<br>
<p>The onus is not on me to prove it's impossible, the
<br>
onus is on Sing Inst to establish it's possible. 
<br>
Medieval mathematicians wasted their whole lives
<br>
trying to do impossible things like 'squaring the
<br>
circle'.  I just hope Eliezer is not wasting his life
<br>
trying to do the FAI equivalent of 'squaring the
<br>
circle'. 
<br>
<p>My own goals are rather more modest than saving the
<br>
world.  I don't think I can 'save the world', and
<br>
indeed, I wouldn't be stupid enough to try.  I rather
<br>
suspect that the best that can be done given that we
<br>
have to respect volition (free will) is create the
<br>
opportunities for each person to take control of their
<br>
own destiny.  You can lead a horse to water, but you
<br>
can't make him drink sort of thing.  Only people
<br>
working together and making the right individual
<br>
choices can 'save the world'.  Nothing can do it for
<br>
them, not even a super intelliegence.
<br>
<p>No, I can't save the world, but I can, I think, save
<br>
myself ;)  Selfish?  Not really.  All I can do is make
<br>
the right individual choices and try to persuade
<br>
others to do the same.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I'd be happy if I could design an SAI that had the
<br>
property of 'friendliness' ('friendliness' with a
<br>
little 'f' rather than 'Friendliness' with a capital
<br>
'F').  A sentient FAI (but without pain and pleasure
<br>
qualia, and without emotions, something which I DO
<br>
agree is possible).  An FAI with a mixture of
<br>
altruistic and observer-centered goals.  An FAI that
<br>
would make an interesting drinking buddy.  An FAI
<br>
that's NOT going to try to 'save the world', but one
<br>
which might just be able to help me save myself.
