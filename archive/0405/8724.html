<p><em>&gt;An important concept, or view, appears to be absent from this

</em><br>
<p>This is a wonderful (and wise) post, Jef. Posts on sl4 (and the extropian 
<br>
list) almost inevitably overvalue the `sovereign individual', because most 
<br>
of us are daily oppressed and hampered by the shortsightedness, comparative 
<br>
ignorance and even mulish stupidity of many of those we have to deal with. 
<br>
It's too easy to edit out the ceaselessly social nature of consciousness, 
<br>
choice, perception, and wisdom (or its contraries).
<br>
<p>Jef comments that `This goes beyond the obvious intentional collaboration 
<br>
on group issues that is fairly well recognized', but I'd like for a moment 
<br>
to pull the discussion back to the most primitive or dyadic level where the 
<br>
constantly constructed Self hides from itself the moderating and/or 
<br>
enhancing influence of other selves.
<br>
<p>I'm a very smart and rather quick-tempered human living with a very smart 
<br>
and passionate if perhaps rather less angry person; it is amusing, in a 
<br>
rueful way, to pause and take note of how in small crises we each vent our 
<br>
immediate emotional response to a galling situation, while the other 
<br>
somewhat sits back, sympathetic but rather more disengaged, and eventually 
<br>
suggests a modified, more effective response to the situation. Sometimes 
<br>
this merely involves toning down the rhetoric of response, sometimes it 
<br>
might propose a subtle and satisfactorily stinging countermeasure; 
<br>
sometimes the very act of echoing back what one has heard or blurted is 
<br>
enough to improve the wisdom quotient of what eventually gets said or done 
<br>
in public. This process is prey to dyadic convergence, or complicity, or 
<br>
even *folie à deux*, but it's startling how often it leads to a better, 
<br>
wiser outcome (and not just a more constrained, stifled, `polite' one).
<br>
<p>A wise AI will surely not be a solitary entity rebooting itself into ever 
<br>
more arcane levels of some sort of timeless wisdom. It must be a social 
<br>
entity, too, from the outset. It has to listen to others, and advise 
<br>
others, and learn from the iterations. The question (it seems to me) is 
<br>
whether such a being can emerge from algorithms running on a substrate that 
<br>
lacks the legacy templates that allow us to empathize with each other (to 
<br>
the compromised degree that we do).
