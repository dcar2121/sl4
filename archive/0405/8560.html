<p><em> &gt; To relate this back to the subjects of main interest here, understanding

</em><br>
<p>This is one of the few news groups where evolutionary psychology is just 
<br>
assumed as background for discussions.
<br>
<p>Most of you have had shorter paths to EP but in my case . . . . Twenty two 
<br>
years ago Eric Drexler lured me into studying modern evolution and memetics 
<br>
by suggesting I read Richard Dawkin's foundational book, _Selfish 
<br>
Gene_.  (Incidentally, if there is anyone or thing left in 50 years to 
<br>
think about the past, Drexler is going to be considered one of the pivotal 
<br>
people.  His 1986 book, _Engines of Creation_ recognized both of the 
<br>
intertwined dangers of nanotechnology and AI that lie just over the horizon.)
<br>
<p>Robert Wright's _Moral Animal_ , a popular survey of the field in 1995 was 
<br>
my introduction to EP.  Matt Ridley has an entire series of books of which 
<br>
my favorite is _Origin of Virtue_.  David Buss reported a great deal of 
<br>
original studies in _Evolution of Desire_.  Other influences are: _The 
<br>
Evolution of Cooperation_ by Robert Axelrod, and the works of EO Wilson, 
<br>
William Hamilton, Robert Trivers, George Williams, Leda Cosmedes, John 
<br>
Tooby and Pascal Boyer to name a sample.
<br>
<p>Another person whose work had a great deal of influence on me is Marvin Minsky.
<br>
<p>His 1988 book &quot;Society of Mind&quot; takes the view of minds as a large numbers 
<br>
of &quot;agents.&quot;   Intelligence becomes an emergent property in interacting 
<br>
agents, each too simple to be considered intelligent.  Memes function to 
<br>
program some of these agents, other agents (psychological traits) have been 
<br>
wired in by evolution.
<br>
<p>This background gave me the tools.  The last 9 years of the scientology 
<br>
cult attacking the net and trying to crush free speech gave me motivation 
<br>
(of the cancer patient kind) to explore the consequences of some of Dr. 
<br>
Minsky's &quot;agents,&quot; particularly the pathological mental states induced by 
<br>
cults and wars.
<br>
<p>This has led to conclusions (some obvious):
<br>
<p>1)  Humans, flexible as they are, are not ideally suited for the 
<br>
environment they have created.
<br>
<p>2)  We have psychological traits that were advantageous in the ancestral 
<br>
hunter gatherer environment where these traits evolved.  Particular evolved 
<br>
traits from the remote past make humans subject to parasitic memes, 
<br>
addictive drugs, gambling and wars.
<br>
<p>3)  Some of these traits, such as the drive for status and the reward of 
<br>
attention, are on all the time.  Others such as capture-bonding (Stockholm 
<br>
Syndrome), the trait to induce capture bonding (TTICB) and the mechanisms 
<br>
that lead to wars are conditionally turned on by environmental conditions.
<br>
<p>4)  Ultimately wars are the result of population growing faster than 
<br>
economic growth.  For reasons rooted in hunter gatherer mode of life, real 
<br>
or (as bad) anticipated privation especially after a run of good times 
<br>
causes the propagation of xenophobic memes and suppresses rational 
<br>
thought.  This leads tribes (or nations) into wars.
<br>
<p>I know I am preaching to the quire here because with an EP background these 
<br>
points are obvious.
<br>
<p>The knowledge of what conditions lead to wars and why should be useful.  Of 
<br>
course the conclusion that empowering women and providing the means to 
<br>
limit births is anathema to the fundamentalist current US administration.
<br>
<p>But (hopefully) we are not stuck with them forever.  Any thoughts as to 
<br>
where these thoughts might usefully be disseminated?
<br>
