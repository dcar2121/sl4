<p>The amount of assurance we can attain, from my experience at least, is 
<br>
much smaller than you seem to hope.   The amount of assurance we can 
<br>
obtain for systems meant to be static and predictable fully isn't all 
<br>
that large.   If this is true of static programs of more than modest 
<br>
capacity then how much more true is it of a program designed to 
<br>
recursively self-improve into an intelligence much greater than our 
<br>
own?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may be that an AGI mind will NOT be able to be instrumented in any

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We will understand the seed at a very large stretch.  We will not 
<br>
understand it for much beyond that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel my biggest realization was inverting my own thinking on the 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; pragmatically a quest to mediate the worst.  After addressing those 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does appear to be the case, is that we have SOME influence within 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this window.  What I've taken away from the SIAI as their overriding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theme, is that we should responsibly use ALL of this time-effort 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; window, and avoid an inferior result from a needlessly premature 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take-off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure I even believe any of us is fully capable of judging when 
<br>
a takeoff is premature.   It may be than any SAI gives us at least a 
<br>
prayer of surviving and thriving beyond a certain point in time.  It is 
<br>
difficult to believe that we have the tools and methodology to really 
<br>
coerce the resulting SAI to our liking.   That doesn't mean we don't 
<br>
try our best.    But it also doesn't mean that holding back until we 
<br>
really understand is a program likely to terminate before the human 
<br>
race does.
