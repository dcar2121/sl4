<p><p>Heh.  This from someone who makes assertions from intuition?  It sounds

just  a wee bit hypocritical.

<p>Maybe what you only *thought* you came up against ultra-smart geniuses. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So maybe Ben and Eliezer are the weak sisters of the AI gang, and 
<br>
hence why you bested them so skillfully.  But if it was your 
<br>
exceptional intuition versus the cold rational intellect of a genuine 
<br>
ultra-smart genius in a Metal Cage Death Match, I'd bet on the genius 
<br>
every time.  Or to put it another way, if your exceptional intuition 
<br>
bested someone, the moniker of &quot;ultra-smart genius&quot; is suspect at best.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; No one has ever seen a general intelligence that lacks
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is possible at all?
</em><br>
<p><p>If all you've ever known is motorcycles, who are you to say that 
<br>
airplanes are impossible based entirely on your vehicle sample 
<br>
population?  You better have a  better reason than &quot;my motorcycle 
<br>
doesn't fly&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; My intuition keeps yelling to me
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.  Something is 'out of kilter' here.  That's all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm saying at the moment.
</em><br>
<p><p>Your intuition also tells you that the world is flat, that lead paint 
<br>
chips are tasty, and that everyone isn't as smart as you are.  Your 
<br>
intuition is lying to you.  It should make you wonder what your 
<br>
intuition is really trying to hide.
