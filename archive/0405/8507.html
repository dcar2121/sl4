<p>A Simulation Study of the
<br>
Psychology of Imprisonment
<br>
Conducted at Stanford University
<br>
<p>Welcome to the Stanford Prison Experiment web site, which features an 
<br>
extensive slide show and information about this classic psychology 
<br>
experiment. What happens when you put good people in an evil place? Does 
<br>
humanity win over evil, or does evil triumph? These are some of the 
<br>
questions we posed in this dramatic simulation of prison life conducted in 
<br>
the summer of 1971 at Stanford University.
<br>
<p>How we went about testing these questions and what we found may astound 
<br>
you. Our planned two-week investigation into the psychology of prison life 
<br>
had to be ended prematurely after only six days because of what the 
<br>
situation was doing to the college students who participated. In only a few 
<br>
days, our guards became sadistic and our prisoners became depressed and 
<br>
showed signs of extreme stress. Please join me on a slide tour of 
<br>
describing this experiment and uncovering what it tells us about the nature 
<br>
of Human Nature.

<br>
<p>Volunteers
<br>
<p>What suspects had done was to answer a local newspaper ad calling for 
<br>
volunteers in a study of the psychological effects of prison life. We 
<br>
wanted to see what the psychological effects were of becoming a prisoner or 
<br>
prison guard. To do this, we decided to set up a simulated a prison and 
<br>
then carefully note the effects of this institution on the behavior of all 
<br>
those within its walls.
<br>
<p>More than 70 applicants answered our ad and were given diagnostic 
<br>
interviews and personality tests to eliminate candidates with psychological 
<br>
problems, medical disabilities, or a history of crime or drug abuse. 
<br>
Ultimately, we were left with a sample of 24 college students from the U.S. 
<br>
and Canada who happened to be in the Stanford area and wanted to earn 
<br>
$15/day by participating in a study. On all dimensions that we were able to 
<br>
test or observe, they reacted normally.
<br>
<p>Our study of prison life began, then, with an average group of healthy, 
<br>
intelligent, middle-class males. These boys were arbitrarily divided into 
<br>
two groups by a flip of the coin. Half were randomly assigned to be guards, 
<br>
the other to be prisoners. It is important to remember that at the 
<br>
beginning of our experiment there were no differences between boys assigned 
<br>
to be a prisoner and boys assigned to be a guard.

<p><em>&gt;As for how this applies to any future AI, I think we have to keep in mind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we're not necessarily trying to re-create the organisation of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human brain in a piece of software, it is just that the human brain and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the human condition are all we have as a model of intelligence - luckily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there's enough intelligence in some of these brains that I think we can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;avoid our shortcomings when creating an AI,
</em><br>
<p>Assuming I am right about the evolutionary origin of this trait in humans, 
<br>
it was figured out less than two weeks ago.  My point, in case you missed 
<br>
it, was that we *don't know* how many other hideously dangerous 
<br>
psychological quirks we have *or* what turns them on.  Miss one and 
<br>
accidentally turn it on in a powerful upload and you could get irrational 
<br>
powerful beings---
<br>
<p>I think I would rather take up of smoking in a powder magazine.
