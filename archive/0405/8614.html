<p>I would refer you back to the relevant sections of the
<br>
'Creating Friendly A.I' document.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI.html">http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI.html</a>
<br>
<p>Go to section 3.4.4: The actual definition of
<br>
Friendliness
<br>
<p>It's described as 'normative'.  Normative means that
<br>
there is convergence to a single morality:
<br>
<p>[Humanity is diverse, and there's still some variance
<br>
even in the panhuman layer, but it's still possible to
<br>
conceive of description for humanity and not just any
<br>
one individual human, by superposing the sum of all
<br>
the variances in the panhuman layer into one
<br>
description of humanity. Suppose, for example, that
<br>
any given human has a preference for X; this
<br>
preference can be thought of as a cloud in
<br>
configuration space. Certain events very strongly
<br>
satisfy the metric for X; others satisfy it more
<br>
weakly; other events satisfy it not at all. Thus,
<br>
there's a cloud in configuration space, with a clearly
<br>
defined center. If you take something in the panhuman
<br>
layer (not the personal layer) and superimpose the
<br>
clouds of all humanity, you should end up with a
<br>
slightly larger cloud that still has a clearly defined
<br>
center. Any point that is squarely in the center of
<br>
the cloud is &quot;grounded in the panhuman layer of
<br>
humanity&quot;.] 
<br>
<p>from 'Creating Friendly A.I' (Yudkowsky)
<br>
<p>The variance in morality between humans is described
<br>
by my term 'Personal Morality'.  But this variance
<br>
does not mean that there isn't a background 'Universal
<br>
Morality' at a high enough level of abstraction. 
<br>
That's why I said that:
<br>
<p>Universal Morality x Personal Morality = Mind
<br>
<p>All the variance between humans is caused by the
<br>
'Personal Morality' term.
<br>
<p>I said that 'Universal Morality' can be thought of as
<br>
'fully present in everyone', because all sentient's
<br>
are potentially capable of modifying their goal
<br>
systems (imagine a seed A.I or a human that becomes
<br>
post-human).  Imagine that at some time in the future
<br>
you under go the 'uplifting' process which turns you
<br>
into a post human.  When you became post human, you
<br>
would have a far better understanding of 'Goodness'
<br>
(because you would be much smarter).  Now imagine
<br>
running a movie of the uplifting process backwards. 
<br>
The inverse of the uplifting process can be said to be
<br>
'filtering out' your understanding of morality which
<br>
is in some sense *already present* in you now (since
<br>
you are potentially capable of taking all the steps
<br>
needed to become post human)
