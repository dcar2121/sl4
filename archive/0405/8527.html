Hi Keith,
<br>
<p>I think conditionally triggered responses are likely to be plentiful in 
<br>
humans as you suspect.
<br>
<p>Just on the issue of cruelty to captives - I think the response is most 
<br>
likely uniquely triggered by the mindset in which the captive is 
<br>
considered.  We can care lovingly for our captive pigeons or rabbits in 
<br>
their cages OR treat the captives like things.  It depends whether we 
<br>
are promed to see them as 'animate and ALSO in the family' or as 
<br>
'mere things'.
<br>
<p>The quote below gives a hint that the perceptual pre-positioning is 
<br>
crucial:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even Kimmitt admitted, &quot;I'd like to sit here and say these are the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only prisoner abuse cases we're aware of, but we know there have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other ones since we have been here in Iraq.&quot; I just don't believe soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do any of this on their own. But let me go beyond this and discuss what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have heard and read about part of the training our government provides our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young people. The word is: DEHUMANIZATION. It happened in Vietnam. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still happening. For a soldier to call an Iraqi a human--unacceptable. Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you even train a person to kill other humans rather haphazardly? I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think so. But if you turn those people into gooks or ragheads, or whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-human assignment you can think of, the soldier is no longer murdering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings. No, they are killing things, bugs, irrelevant living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures. Isn't this the attitude reflected in these photos?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I saw similar pictures as these in the Winter Soldier hearings. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soldiers had not just killed the enemy and murdered people. They had gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the hunt, and successfully bagged their prey. Imagine hunters throwing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their ducks on the back of their pickup truck. Imagine a fisherman having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his picture taken while standing next to his big fish hanging on a hook.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine soldiers throwing their enemy in piles and having their pictures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken giving a big &quot;thumbs up&quot; to the people at home. Oops--you don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to imagine that, we saw it on 60 Minutes. This is war. War is not pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or noble. This is what we are training our young people to do in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; win.
</em><br>

<br>
<p>I found the book &quot;Religion explained&quot; useful in helping to identify some 
<br>
underlying mental architecture that conditions how we see/respond to 
<br>
things outside ourselves. (Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins 
<br>
of Religious Thought by Pascal Boyer (April 2002)
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
