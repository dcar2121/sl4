Why have more than one AGI?
<br>
<p>Because each AGI type would be different at least to the extent that:
<br>
-   their highest-order goal structures varied 
<br>
-   their thinking architecture varied 
<br>
-   their hardware base varied (especially in terms of grunt and speed,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inter AGI/human communications hardware) 
<br>
<p>Also each instance of an AGI would vary according to its training and 
<br>
experience and what it is working on (major projects).
<br>
<p>The fact that AGIs could have 'telepathy' and high bandwidth 
<br>
communication, including of non-linear massively complex data sets 
<br>
would not in my opinion change the significance of the above because 
<br>
even an AGI is going to have to do work to integrate info received from 
<br>
another AGI and when the info integration has occurred the AGIs are 
<br>
still not identical.  In my opinion mind-melds would not obliterate the 
<br>
unique characteristics of AGIs.
<br>
<p>So why have more than one AGI? Because they would have different 
<br>
strengths and weaknesses that would make them better suited to 
<br>
different tasks and because they could provide each other with second 
<br>
opinions/alternate perspectives/reality checks and could work 
<br>
collectively to manage risks arising from aberrant AGIs.
<br>
<p>I've thought about whether I'm anthropomophising or biology-mophising 
<br>
and I can't see any reason to think that I am.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
