<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Can you tell me how would *you* would envisage we could enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*wisdom* via genetic engineering??
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) Engineer an emotional and not just intellectual respect for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientific method. Ever though it works great, evolution never gave us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the ability to love the scientific method in our gut because for all its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;virtues it works too slowly to help much in surviving in the jungle; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;controlled experiment examining the consequences of running and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;running from a Saber Toothed Tiger is not a very good idea.  This lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respect is the reason we believe in spoon benders, flying saucers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;racism, the image of The Virgin seen in a pizza topping, and God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) Engineer a visceral understanding of statistics. Flying is the safest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way to travel yet many people feel safer driving a car even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statistically it is more dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3) In general, when we recognize that one of our feelings is irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we should always have the ability to change it. Example: Fear of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;snakes is a good idea, fear of all snakes is not; Fear of falling is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good idea, fear of working on the 24’th floor is not.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think for 1&amp;2, its well beyond the 
<br>
ability of genetic engineering to do so 
<br>
straightforwardly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both statistics and the scientific method 
<br>
are ideas that act at the level of high level 
<br>
abstract thought. While I can conceive of it 
<br>
being possible to somehow re-engineer humanity to 
<br>
better balance cognitive judgements with sensory 
<br>
biases etc, I don't think its possible to choose 
<br>
what those cognitive judgements will be. To reuse 
<br>
someone elses metaphor, its like trying to 
<br>
enforce particular computer GUIs in the chip 
<br>
design.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last point is an interesting one. Its 
<br>
never going to be genetic engineering alone that 
<br>
achieves this, and I think its highly likely that 
<br>
genetic engineering will have very little to do 
<br>
with whats essentially a psychological question. 
<br>
But even if we have such an ability, I thinks its 
<br>
unlikely that it will ever be restricted to the 
<br>
ability to chance only to feelings that are MORE 
<br>
rational, though many of us will try to use it 
<br>
that way. I think it far more likely that, for 
<br>
every 1 person that has a genuine phobia and can 
<br>
remove it, we get 10 that try to re-engineer 
<br>
their own personal responses to fit in with the 
<br>
demands of their personal relationships, to 
<br>
improve job prospects, and other personal goals 
<br>
(which nevertheless seem terribly important to 
<br>
the individuals concerned).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers
<br>
