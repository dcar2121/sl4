</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Still one should remember that Stanford is just a one experiment with one
<br>
kind of population. More tests of the kind would be required to find out,
<br>
if the results hold for all kinds of population schemes. In addition this
<br>
does not take into account the possibility that the game theoretic
<br>
structure of a prison might create incentives toward such behavior - which
<br>
if true will undermine Keith's thesis. It also does not take into account
<br>
the possibility that these things arise from the social ideas in our
<br>
culture (combined with the incentive structure).
<br>
<p>This of course does not mean that we should not be careful when creating
<br>
an AI, be it uploaded person or a creation. It does not mean that we
<br>
should not look into the incentive structures that we create for the super
<br>
AI to come.

I think you're very right Mikko, there's obviously more to this than we can sum up in a few e-mails, for instance my first thoughts were, what kind of person joins the army ? Is it not likely to be someone with traits of dominance and with a propensity, if not desire, for violence? As for the stanford experiment, what do we know about those that took part, were they volunteers? Did the guards volunteer to be guards? As for how this applies to any future AI, I think we have to keep in mind that we're not necessarily trying to re-create the organisation of the human brain in a piece of software, it is just that the human brain and the human condition are all we have as a model of intelligence - luckily there's enough intelligence in some of these brains that I think we can avoid our shortcomings when creating an AI, one of the reasons I think AI is so fascinating.
