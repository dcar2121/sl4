<em>&gt; &gt; I suspect that for any adequately intelligent system there is some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nonzero possibility of the system reaching ANY POSSIBLE POINT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This had been said many times before by wiser heads than me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but once again 'probabilistic self-modification is bad'. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took meembarrassinglyy long to get this too, but it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious in retrospect. Of course sufficiently implausible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware and/or software failure can cause any design to fail 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in implementation, but that risk class is very low in sane designs.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this issue is somewhat subtle, and gets into some sketchy theory
<br>
I've developed but never written up as it's not concrete enough yet.
<br>
<p>Firstly, I'll posit:
<br>
<p>HYPOTHESIS: COMPUTATIONAL DEPTH OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (CDIS)
<br>
It's not possible to have a system that's capable of a high level of
<br>
intelligence and creativity, that is entirely predictable in its
<br>
behavior (unless that prediction is done via invoking a truly
<br>
unrealistic amount of computing power to do the prediction via basically
<br>
simulating the system and environment at a faster rate).  
<br>
<p>In computation-theory terms, this hypothesis claims that intelligent
<br>
systems are programs with a large &quot;computational depth&quot; (a notion
<br>
introduced by Charles Bennett), meaning that there is no way to simulate
<br>
their results, given their descriptions, without using a large amount of
<br>
run-time (in the sense of a large number of computational steps).
<br>
<p>Now to validate or refute this hypothesis, would require a kind of
<br>
science and mathematics that is not remotely near available right now.
<br>
<p>Of course, you are welcome to believe that the CDIS hypothesis is false.
<br>
It's just a hypothesis, I haven't proved it.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, CDIS does NOT emply that intelligent systems are not
<br>
probabilistically predictable.  It just implies that they're not exactly
<br>
predictable.
<br>
<p>A relatively &quot;safe&quot; self-modifying AGI design is one that is predictable
<br>
with a relatively high (but not absolute) degree of certainty.  Now, how
<br>
MUCH certainty can be found for any intelligent system is the next
<br>
question.  I suspect there is some kind of INTELLIGENCE INDETERMINACY
<br>
PRINCIPLE (IIP) of the rough form
<br>
<p>degree_of_predictability &lt; f( intelligence)
<br>
<p>where f is a decreasing function (which however may start to decrease
<br>
more slowly for large degrees of intelligence).
<br>
<p>[Yeah, of course it's probably not this simple, there are probably other
<br>
variables involved too; this is just a &quot;heuristic equation&quot; expressing
<br>
an intuitive idea]
<br>
<p>We then get to the interesting part.  For each intelligent system, there
<br>
are some things that will be more predictable than others.  The Friendly
<br>
AI problem requires creating an intelligent systems that is maximally
<br>
predictable in the particular domain of ethics, although it may be
<br>
unpredictable in other domains.  It doesn't require that the
<br>
self-modification of an AI system be tractably deterministic -- which is
<br>
fortunate, since that would contradict CDIS and IIP.  It merely requires
<br>
that certain probabilities about the future evolution of the system be
<br>
estimable with a high degree of confidence (e.g. the probability that it
<br>
kills us all).
<br>
<p>All this doesn't get us any further toward creating a Friendly AI --
<br>
except that it argues for the shutting-down of some dead-end paths
<br>
toward Friendly AI, such as the path that seeks an AI whose overall
<br>
behavior is in some sense predictable.
<br>
<p>In short I don't believe that &quot;probabilistic self-modification is bad.&quot;
<br>
I think that probabilistic self-modification leads to systems with high
<br>
computational depth, but that all intelligent systems are going to have
<br>
high computational depth anyway.
<br>
<p>The challenge of FAI is to create a system that displays the uncertainty
<br>
and unpredictability characteristic of intelligence, yet is highly
<br>
predictable in the domain of ethics.
<br>
