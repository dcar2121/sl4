<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for an excellent reasoned reply (even though I'm going to
<br>
argue with it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The actual principle is 'you shouldn't do anything you think might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an existential risk until you've worked it through and proved to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few relevant experts that it probably isn't'.
</em><br>
<p>I fully agree with this statement; however, I'm seeing a lot of debate
<br>
between Eliezer and Ben where it's devolved to the point where Eliezer is no
<br>
longer willing to fully engage with valid points.  Once Eliezer is no longer
<br>
willing to engage with an individual who is probably closest to him in terms
<br>
of understanding/drive/etc., then, &lt;italicized&gt;in my way of looking at
<br>
things&lt;/italics&gt; Eliezer has forfeited a huge chunk of his
<br>
responsibility/moral authority/effectiveness/whatever.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may have noticed that quite a few people on SL4 /aren't/ whining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about not understanding the theory and how this isn't their fault. Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps you missed that?
</em><br>
<p>I've noticed a lot of people asking for clarification where they are going
<br>
wrong and not receiving that clarification.  I, personally, am not whining
<br>
about not understanding the theory.  I think that I've got a good grasp on
<br>
some of it and am working on the rest.  I also think that there are a number
<br>
of missed opportunities both in the theory and in the attempt at spreading
<br>
the meme.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Teenagers aren't qualified to judge existential risks or do serious
</em><br>
science,
<br>
<em>&gt; period. It is unfortunate that the pathetic state of academic AI forced
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; to do some of the vital intermediate work. Since everyone else did and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most part continues to do noticeably worse, this criticism while
</em><br>
relevant
<br>
<em>&gt; does not strike me as calling for a change in roles.
</em><br>
<p>Change in roles?  I'm not sure what you mean.  I don't want/expect Eliezer
<br>
to change roles.  I would like to see him work more collaboratively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Relying upon a single point of failure (meaning both a single FAI and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; single you) is incredibly foolish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the best strategy we have for now.
</em><br>
<p>I suspect that we'll end up just having to agree to disagree on this one but
<br>
. . . .
<br>
<p>1.  Why do you believe that a single FAI is the best strategy?  To me, it's
<br>
a single point of failure or like a mono-culture of crops in agriculture.
<br>
One mistake or one disease and POOF! smiley faces everywhere.  Why do you
<br>
think that NASA uses multiply redundant systems?
<br>
<p>2.  Why do you believe that relying on Eliezer and only Eliezer is a good
<br>
strategy.  He's only human and ANY human makes mistakes, has prejudices,
<br>
overlooks things, and can always benefit from collaboration.
<br>
<p>I really, vehemently disagree that this is even NOT a BAD strategy much less
<br>
a good one much less the best strategy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the best strategy we have for now. However you may have noticed
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; SIAI seed AI team recruitment call in the last newsletter, so if you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can improve on this by all means send someone in or get in touch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself.
</em><br>
<p>I signed up on the seedaiwannabes list when I first joined SL4 quite some
<br>
time ago.  I made sure that I was still signed up recently.  I've been
<br>
getting myself up to speed on a number of things, keeping myself up to speed
<br>
on others, and doing some work here and there.  Personally, though, I've
<br>
often wondered whether the seedaiwannabes list is just a honeypot to keep
<br>
dangerous crackpots at bay . . . .  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; SL4 is in theory an information-dense debating forum and news feed, not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chummy chat list. While in practice we're pretty informal anyway, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want a lighter atmosphere and on-demand snappy explanations please try the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; #sl4 IRC channel.
</em><br>
<p>And my problem is that recently it HASN'T appeared to be information-dense.
<br>
I've seen way to much of the refusal to engage and that's what I'm objecting
<br>
to.  I don't want/need/expect chummy, lighter atmosphere, or even on-demand
<br>
snappy explanations for me - - but I do expect serious engagement with the
<br>
most seriously engaged other participants.
<br>
<p>Anyways, I don't mean to slam you and I'm probably picking on Eliezer a bit
<br>
much as well but it seems as if recently (and I've been around for a while),
<br>
Eliezer has devolved to &quot;everything is too dangerous&quot; but &quot;I'm much too busy
<br>
to discuss it or even write it up for anybody&quot; and I think that is a REALLY
<br>
BAD THING(tm).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark
