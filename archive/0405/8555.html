Hi Philip,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway I guess my final feeling thoght is that your method could work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while AIs and humans are confined to the Earth but it is likely to break
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down once this is not the case - especially if the AIs proliferate through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe.  How would you see you method working in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'geographically' non-constrained situation?
</em><br>
<p>One possibility is analogously to the way it works in
<br>
humans. We value the happiness of other humans (for
<br>
example, mothers value the happiness of their children)
<br>
and we learn to connect the identity of those other
<br>
humans with their changing appearance and to remote
<br>
communication with them (such as via telephone).
<br>
Furthermore, we internalize the values of their
<br>
happiness. For example, I had a memorial for my mother
<br>
at her church, despite the fact that there were no
<br>
other surviving family members and certainly a church
<br>
service means nothing to me, just because it was what
<br>
she would have wanted. I think we can design AIs to
<br>
learn to identify uploaded humans as humans whose
<br>
happiness they should value, and uploaded humans may
<br>
travel in ways that are impossible for natural humans.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Bill
