<p>Actually, a major thrust of what Win Wenger has to say
<br>
about increasing one's intelligence (winwenger.com,
<br>
highly recommended) is based on the idea that the
<br>
human mind has scads of intelligence to call upon,
<br>
while the conscious part is but the tip of an iceberg,
<br>
i.e. the 1/6 that is visible above the surface, or
<br>
even perhaps like a Pacific atoll atop a seamount
<br>
which is 99% submerged.
<br>
Let me tell you an amusing tale of unconscious human
<br>
intelligence. It was told to me by a witness I
<br>
consider truthful, and although it concerns me, I have
<br>
no memory of it.
<br>
<p>I was napping in the afternoon once, four or five
<br>
years ago perhaps, or sleeping late, I don't remember
<br>
which. I am a heavy sleeper. My daughter Heidi came
<br>
into the room for some reason, and found me in a dream
<br>
state. I was lying on my back, eyes closed, hand
<br>
waving in the air, trying to grab something in front
<br>
of me. My daughter was fascinated. Apparently I was
<br>
having trouble grasping It, as it eluded me like a
<br>
butterfly. Who knows what It really was. So, in the
<br>
name of Science, she intervened. She mimed handing me
<br>
something and said, &quot;Here it is.&quot; She says I took it
<br>
and clutched it to my chest, smiling, eyes still
<br>
closed. Then she got really curious. She says she
<br>
crept close, as quietly as possible, and reached
<br>
toward the mysterious object in my hand. Without
<br>
opening my eyes or waking up, I slapped her hand and
<br>
rolled over. She says it was both funny and amazing.
<br>
<p>So, yes, I agree. Intelligence can do a lot without
<br>
being conscious. It's just that an outside observer
<br>
may not be able to tell when consciousness is there or
<br>
not. If I slept with my eyes open my daughter would
<br>
have assumed I was awake.
