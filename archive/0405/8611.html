<p>
Eli’s recent posts sparked some additional ideas in my
<br>
brain yesterday.  I have my own theory of
<br>
Friendliness, and yesterday the final pieces came
<br>
together.
<br>
<p>What follows is a quick summary of these latest
<br>
musings
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>‘Take the visual image of something as an analogy for
<br>
a thing.  Then regard a hologram of that image as an
<br>
analogy for the mental representation (concept).  Now
<br>
a hologram has the property that cutting the picture
<br>
in half does not result in half an image.  The full
<br>
image is still there, only the resolution is not as
<br>
sharp.  You could go on cutting up a hologram and
<br>
still see the full image in each fragment, only the
<br>
resolution would be becoming less and less sharp.  So
<br>
we could consider the 'resolution' of the hologram as
<br>
analogous to a measure of how well a mind is
<br>
understanding a given concept, and the many possible
<br>
'fragments' of the original hologram as analogous to
<br>
many different individual viewpoints of the concept
<br>
between people with varying levels of intelligence
<br>
(everyone sees the same thing, but they all see it
<br>
slightly differently).
<br>
<p>If it's a valid analogy then you can see that even a
<br>
sentient of very low intelligence could still obtain
<br>
some kind of 'understanding' about any concept, no
<br>
matter how complex or abstract.  It is simply the case
<br>
that the low IQ sentient sees the concept in 'low
<br>
resolution', like a very low-res holographic image. 
<br>
The sentient can still dimly make out the broad
<br>
outlines of the image.  Now. Let’s imagine 'turning up
<br>
the IQ' of the sentient.  This would be equivalent to
<br>
increasing the resolution of the hologram, so the
<br>
image becomes sharper and sharper.
<br>
<p>Let's take the concept of 'Friendliness'.  Consider an
<br>
FAI with post-human super intelligence.  Can we puny
<br>
humans say anything about the AI's morality?  If the
<br>
hologram analogy is valid, we can.  We may not be
<br>
entirely sure what 'good' and 'evil' is, but we can
<br>
kind of recognize it when we see it.  That is, we
<br>
could be said to have access to a very low-res
<br>
hologram of 'good' and ‘evil’: the whole abstract
<br>
'form' is available to us; we just don't see it
<br>
clearly.  So let's now consider our rapidly
<br>
self-improving AI.  As it grows smarter and smarter,
<br>
this would be equivalent to continuously increasing
<br>
the resolution of the 'morality holograms'.  What is
<br>
happening is equivalent to an 'optimization' of
<br>
morality.  The super-intelligent post-human FAI will
<br>
have a 'morality' hologram of enormously increased
<br>
resolution.  But there is still a common frame of
<br>
reference with us puny humans.  The 'morality'
<br>
hologram is still accessible to us in its entirety
<br>
(albeit in the much degraded low-res form).     
<br>
<p>Now, if I may mention my 'Fundamental Theorem of
<br>
Morality' again, you'll see how these ideas tie in to
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>You may recall I described my theorem by the formula:
<br>
<p>Universal Morality x Personal Morality = Mind
<br>
<p>[You can read a sketch outline of my theorem here: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?FundamentalTheoremofMorality">http://www.sl4.org/bin/wiki.pl?FundamentalTheoremofMorality</a>
<br>
]
<br>
<p>Taking the hologram analogy, the term 'Universal
<br>
Morality' is equivalent to the complete image
<br>
representing the moral concept 'Goodness'.  'Personal
<br>
Morality' is equivalent to another image representing
<br>
arbitrary goals determined by a specific physical
<br>
instantiation of a mind (for instance in humans these
<br>
would be biological constraints and goals established
<br>
by evolution).  The 'x' (multiplication sign)
<br>
represents the interaction between the two images.  We
<br>
could superimpose the two images to produce a
<br>
hologram: the result 'Mind' (the mind or goal system
<br>
of a sentient) is equivalent to a somewhat lower
<br>
resolution image of 'Goodness' mixed with arbitrary
<br>
elements.  We want to 'optimize' the 'Mind' to produce
<br>
increasingly 'higher resolution' representations of
<br>
'Goodness' (Universal Morality).  The FAI problem
<br>
amounts to knowing how to optimize ‘Personal Morality'
<br>
so as to enable 'Universal Morality' to shine through.
<br>
<p>The most important thing to note about my theorem is
<br>
that it says that for all sentient minds THE WHOLE OF
<br>
UNIVERSAL MORALITY IS ALREADY THERE.  That’s right: 
<br>
The entire concept of 'Goodness' (Universal Morality)
<br>
is in some sense already present in all of our minds. 
<br>
Recall my formula again:
<br>
<p>Universal Morality x Personal Morality = Mind
<br>
<p>There is only one Universal Morality.  It is Personal
<br>
Morality that has many degrees of freedom, and
<br>
Personal Morality that defines the differences between
<br>
us.  So for all minds, we start the specification with
<br>
the 'Universal Morality' (Complete Goodness) term.
<br>
<p>We note that although Universal Morality is present in
<br>
all of us, it is 'filtered' by our 'Personal
<br>
Morality'.  Our Personal Morality interferes with
<br>
Universal Morality, and as a result we can only access
<br>
a very 'low resolution' image of 'Goodness'.  So
<br>
learning to be more moral is an 'optimization
<br>
process’: we need to start adjusting our Personal
<br>
Morality in order to let Universal Morality shine
<br>
through.  And we'll do this through a combination of
<br>
self-discipline and changes to the biological
<br>
structure of or minds (making ourselves post-human). 
<br>
As our mind/morality/goal system is optimized, we will
<br>
have access to higher and higher resolution 'images'
<br>
of Universal Morality (Complete Goodness).’
