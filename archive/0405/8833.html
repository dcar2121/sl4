Mark Waser,
<br>
<p>You wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah.  I wasn't clear.  What I was envisioning is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set-up with multiple FAIs where none of them are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permitted to take an action unless all agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having three human beings with nuclear keys (all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of which are required to fire the missiles) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less risk than having two or one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Having multiple independent AIs with different histories is an already
<br>
acknowledged good idea.  It is a matter of definition as to whether such a
<br>
group of reasoners would be considered a single FAI or not.  I suspect that
<br>
this kind of redundancy would be highly beneficial in avoiding errors.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not relying on Eliezer.  I do think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's unfortunate that others apparently are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, as I've said, I have volunteered to donate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Kudos to you.  I have also, and do.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Watching Eliezer refuse to give the time of day to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those individuals who appear most likely to be most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of assisting him (or developing FAI on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own) is most frustrating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think Eliezer's response to this question clarifies the situation
<br>
considerably.  To my personal knowledge, those individuals that have shown
<br>
significant understanding to the FAI ideas, and contributed either
<br>
significant insights, or pointed out problems, have received considerably
<br>
more than 'the time of day'.  This includes Ben, by the way.
<br>
<p><p>Michael Roy Ames.
