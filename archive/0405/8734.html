I think you've made a great point here.  At the rate mankind's knowledge
<br>
has increased over the last century, one might think that all of that
<br>
knowledge applied to the world's problems would have made the world a
<br>
utopia.  If it had actually been applied to the world's problems, maybe
<br>
it would have had a greater impact and things would be &quot;better&quot; now.
<br>
But in actuality, the things that get funded are generally those with
<br>
the highest perceived probability of economic return.  So drug companies
<br>
explore laboratory solutions to health problems instead of herbs,
<br>
because you can't patent a herb.  Food companies create sugary cereals
<br>
because that's what kids like, not because it'll create healthier kids.
<br>
We already have the capacity to make a better world, but we don't use
<br>
what we have.  So the big question, how will creating enhanced humans or
<br>
AIs actually help the world?  What evidence is there to predict that a
<br>
higher intelligence won't simply be used to invent a better-selling
<br>
cereal?

<em>&gt; It would be great to be able to apply more intelligence to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solving the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems humanity is causing, but with the current way ways that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people live across the globe and the power structures that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow to remain in place it is not clear that increasing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence grunt or the capability levels will result in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any improvement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if most of that intelligence increment is not applied to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solving these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems.
