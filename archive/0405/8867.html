<em>&gt; It does not follow that a catastrophe that will break one AI will be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to break multiple AIs.  That would be anthropomorphic thinking.
</em><br>
<p>Why is it anthropomorphic thinking that a catastrophe that will break one AI
<br>
will be less likely to break multiple AIs?
<br>
<p>It is very reasonable to envision a situation where two different AIs have
<br>
two very different lines of reasoning for the same conclusion and where one
<br>
AI is led astray when one of it's premises that is not shared by the other
<br>
AI is catastrophically invalidated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings it is demonstrably true that groups have greater abilities to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address unexpected situations.  It is true because:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a) several humans have more data than one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  b) several humans have more MIPS than one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  c) humans are optimized by evolution to work in groups as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  d) several humans have greater physical work capacity than one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of these points *has* to be true of AI.  AI is not like humans in
</em><br>
these
<br>
<em>&gt; ways.
</em><br>
<p>And none of these points is what I'm relying on for my argument.  If two
<br>
different AIs have two different points of failure, then one COMMON failure
<br>
will not take out both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The concepts 'redundancy' and 'diversity of opinion' are different
</em><br>
concepts.
<br>
<em>&gt; It can be confusing to co-present them as two sides of the same coin.
</em><br>
<p>Let me rephrase.  If diversity of opinion leads to the same ultimate
<br>
conclusion, then you effectively have a redundancy that is immune to a
<br>
single point of failure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Diversity can be contained/generated from within a single object named FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as from mutually independent objects - and probably with less work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are often many ways of looking at a given problem, and different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoints reveal/hide different aspects of that problem.  Your argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to imply that a single object named FAI would be unable to analyze
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems in multiple ways - meaning: as if being looked at by multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans.  I would say that is a false implication.
</em><br>
<p>We can always play with semantics.  I could get together ten different
<br>
people and call the group (a single object) FAI and then FAI would be able
<br>
to analyze problems multiple ways.  The problem is that you're obscuring
<br>
useful distinctions that way.
<br>
<p>My argument is that either you don't truly have a single object and
<br>
therefore you are contorting yourself by treating it that way OR you do have
<br>
a single object and it is insufficiently partitioned to adequately separate
<br>
it's processes to produce safely independent conclusions.  Look at it as a
<br>
definition/distinction that enough partitioning to produce independent
<br>
conclusions means separate mind objects.
