Pablo,
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Eg: Though I desire an espresso now, I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that if I drink one I'll have trouble falling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; asleep later, so I make myself a warm milk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, but then we shouldn't describe the action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a case of allowing the agent to do what she
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why shouldn't we?  You seem to be viewing an agent's decision as being
<br>
spread out over time.  This is simply incorrect.  An agent makes a decision
<br>
at a specific time, and that decision represents what that agent wants to
<br>
do.  We currently exist as beings who progress through time as like a point
<br>
along a line, in one direction.  It makes no sense to ignore that and
<br>
suggest that an agent's wants become incoherent when viewed over a range of
<br>
times.  That is just sophistry.
<br>
<p>I don't rule out that there might exist different beings who occupy a range
<br>
of time-points, simultaneously (difficult word choice!) but we are not that
<br>
kind of being right now.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose I know I will be probably ruined if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue gambling, but I decide to do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway. I'm then doing what is not in my best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest to do. I'm then acting irrationally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To say that &quot;agents not acting in their best interests are irrational&quot; is
<br>
incorrect.  An outside observer cannot decide what the best interests of a
<br>
volitional being are.  It is the volitional being's responsibility to do
<br>
this.  To forcefully take away that responsibility is morally negative.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's maxim, then, becomes inapplicable.  [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What is &quot;Eliezer's maxim&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we care about the person, why do we only consider a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporal phase of his? Why do we listen to his present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to ruin his future temporal phases, and not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future desires he will have NOT to have acted in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that will have cost him his health, his wealth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his happiness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Because we respect his volition - his right to decide for himself.  Who are
<br>
we to decide for him?  Are we his nursemaid?  His ruler?  His god?  Again, I
<br>
have no objections to offering assistance, help, aid and our best advice,
<br>
but the decision should rest with the volitional being.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it's time to abandon normative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individualism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  Don't think so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe the fundamental units of moral/prudential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assessment are not persons, but temporal phases?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I haven't heard a convincing argument for this.  Right now I am a being like
<br>
a point on a timeline, with limited abilities at modeling the future and
<br>
myself in it.  I have no ability to step off that timeline and assess what
<br>
actually happens over a &quot;temporal phase&quot; - that is beyond my capability.
<br>
Therefore, such an action cannot be the basis on which I can make a moral
<br>
assessment.
<br>
<p>In your above statement, why do you join moral and prudential as
<br>
moral/prudential?  They are two completely different ideas and joining them
<br>
makes no sense to me.  A prudential assessment is utterly different from a
<br>
moral assessment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe good and bad ultimately exist only in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such unidimensional &quot;locations&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What do you mean by unidiminsional locations?
<br>
<p><p>Michael Roy Ames
