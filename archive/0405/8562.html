<p>Often in conflict.  That's why I put it in quotes.  It seems to me
<br>
that the problem is likely not solvable for entities which are roughly
<br>
comparable in intelligence, but which have different goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Unless you are intelligent enough to closely simulate that person,

<em>&gt; Ten years ago I would have agreed with you.  There is a strong

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But over the past ten years I have come to see &quot;the person&quot; as 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think that using terms and phrases like &quot;infection&quot;, &quot;parasitic&quot;, and
<br>
&quot;pathological&quot; presupposes your conclusion.  In particular, the idea of
<br>
a parasitic meme is an example of its own class (if the idea is valid at
<br>
all) because it short circuits the process of deciding whether a 
<br>
behavior
<br>
is useful for your supergoal.   Therefore, making a determination about
<br>
whether someone else is &quot;infected&quot; seems inconsistent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We are *social* primates.  Rational behavior (sanity if you will) is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a considerable extent maintained by interactions with those &quot;in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your tribe.&quot;  That being the case, we have self-interest in keeping 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our neighbors sane, and they in keeping us sane--especially since we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have mechanisms that switch on irrational behavior in response to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental conditions (though &quot;irrational behavior&quot; may be rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a gene's viewpoint in a hunter gatherer environment--key phrase 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Google &quot;xenophobic memes&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>There's an interesting book by John McCrone, _The Myth of 
<br>
Irrationality_,
<br>
which addresses some of this.  Entertainingly, the third Google result
<br>
(I couldn't remember who wrote it) was 
<br>
virus.lucifer.com/books/myth.html ,
<br>
suggesting that I'm not the only transhumanist who believes this is
<br>
relevant.
<br>
<p>While I feel that this is relevant to the topic of AI design, I'm
<br>
willing to accept anyone else's determination that it isn't. :)
