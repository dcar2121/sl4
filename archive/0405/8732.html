<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>My main point in this dialogue was: I don't believe I'm so ignorant or
<br>
such a dipshit or so hide-bound by my preconceptions that, if you
<br>
articulated your current theories on FAI and related subjects, I'd be
<br>
unable to understand them.  I've understood a lot of opaque and subtle
<br>
things from a lot of scientific disciplines.  I don't believe that your
<br>
insights are an order of magnitude more difficult to grok than
<br>
everything else in science, math, philosophy, etc.
<br>
<p>Next, to respond briefly to a few other peripheral points from your
<br>
message...
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
I'm quite knowledgeable of probability theory, including Bayes rule and
<br>
its accompanying apparatus, so if I make errors in judgment about FAI or
<br>
related topics, it's not because of ignorance of probabilistic
<br>
mathematics.  I used to teach that sorta math in the university, back in
<br>
the olden days.  And I've done a lot of work with probabilistic
<br>
inference lately, in the Novamente context.
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
It really doesn't seem to me that YOU are more rational than most
<br>
scientists I know, although you talk about rationality more, and are
<br>
more interested in your own rationality.  I think you're a highly
<br>
rational person, relative to most humans; but from my point of view, it
<br>
seems that your emotions affect your judgment sometimes, just like with
<br>
everyone else.  You may argue this is not the case -- but then, I
<br>
suppose the scientists who you call less-rational-than-Eliezer would
<br>
argue with you and defend their own rationality as well....  
<br>
<p>I have known others who seemed to me more consistently rational than
<br>
either you OR me; but all these folks were also significantly less
<br>
creative than either of us.  
<br>
<p>3)
<br>
About recognizing, in hindsight, the stupidity of alchemy: yes, of
<br>
course, it's relatively easy to avoid making mistakes of the same type
<br>
that were made in the past (though humans as a whole are not so good at
<br>
even this!).  What's much harder is to avoid making *new* types of
<br>
mistakes.  The universe is remarkably good at generating new kinds of
<br>
mistakes to make fools out of us ;-)

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; alchemist that there is no way to concoct an immortality serum by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; mixing random chemicals together.  Bearing in mind that the first

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Bearing in mind that there is in fact no way to do it, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ignorant of this does not change Nature's law in the slightest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem is that the realistic and frightened medieval alchemist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually has no way of knowing that concocting an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality serum is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impossible.   We know that NOW because of the science we've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but no one could know that in the medieval times.  Alchemy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was not as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stupid then as it is now.  Which is why there were more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alchemists then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than now....  Alchemy is idiotic only in hindsight, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is why someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as brilliant as Isaac Newton was an avid alchemist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the second alchemist, having triumphantly proved that he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is genuinely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant of the difficulty, drinks his immortality potion and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dies.  What's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong with this picture?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is why it is important never to place yourself in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have something to gain by proving your ignorance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the realistic and frightened alchemist happens to be a Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalist with a history of science to study, it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforward enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in hindsight (once you realize the danger exists) to notice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that nobody has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any legitimate reason to expect an immortality serum to pop 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of randomly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixing chemicals.  Or think that the difficulty of mixing an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serum might be comparable to the difficulty of building an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airplane.  Or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compare heartwarming mystical thinking about immortality serums to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heartwarming mystical thinking about vitalism.  Or to observe that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present-day alchemy is a field in chaos, with many facts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known, but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generalizations mystical, heartwarming, and unpredictive.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mistake is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious in retrospect and once I caught myself at it - my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous self's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triumphant ignorance of the Singularity or the nature of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mistake also becomes obvious looking forward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, Isaac Newton didn't see the stupidity of alchemy.  Isaac 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Newton had a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much shorter scientific history to study.  Newton did not read about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary psychology, vitalism, Bayes (Laplace, actually), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Thomas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuhn.  I am sick and tiring of hearing about allegedly smart 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made mistake XYZ.  Isaac Newton was irrational?  Fine.  Do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you suppose that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one is ever allowed to do better, lest it diminish the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; luster of sacred 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Newton's name?  Humanity has moved on, and today's geniuses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may aspire to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher standards.  It's not like Isaac Newton applied his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genius to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics of rationality.  I have more shoulders to stand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, and I can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do better than that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rationality is not an innate talent, though it depends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly on innate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talent.  Training the innate talent requires knowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity has only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recently discovered, not known to Newton's day.  And learning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the art of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality requires changing yourself as a person, an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconvenience to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which few scientists are willing to subject themselves.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is so much more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fun to leave the map blank, for then you can draw in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heartwarming lands 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would like to see.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If alchemy was less visibly stupid in medieval times, it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was no history of science to tell worried alchemists the folly of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heartwarming ignorance, or the improbability of specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex miracles, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or that Nature does not need to convince you of the danger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before She is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed to kill you.  Today that is not a valid excuse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; There is too much science.  Funny, how the people asserting the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; ignorance of science on some subject are so rarely specialists in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; *particular* field...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am a specialist in the field of dynamical systems (at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, I was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few years back, I published in the field, knew all the literature, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc.).  So I think I know basically what is known about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractors, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terminal attractors, invariant measures, etc. of complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it ain't nearly enough to tell us anything about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attractors etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that complex self-modifying AI's will get into.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interestingly enough, my &quot;too much science&quot; quote was cribbed from an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpublished work which reads:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;How could anyone possibly state with confidence that science 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thing, if he were not a specialist in that field?  And even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then, outside 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialists might know detailed technical answers to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fancied untouched mysteries of your own field.  I had lost 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; track of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of papers I had read, offering up as mysteries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field had solved.  And when someone gave their favorite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mystery as proof of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity's ignorance, more commonly than not there would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire journals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devoted to the answer, a depth of technical knowledge that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretched back 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for decades, international conferences and research 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutes.  There 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be multiple fields of science devoted to separate parts of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.  Science was a huge edifice, already vastly more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than any lone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human could absorb, and it kept on accumulating.  No one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could say what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science did not know.  There was too much science.  One 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to train 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oneself to always ask if a mystery might already have a known answer, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than incredulously saying, 'But how could anyone know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?'  For 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seven-eighths of the time, someone would.  That was what it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meant to live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a world of billions of individuals, rather than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunter-gatherer tribe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of two hundred.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case the math of dynamical systems (of which I do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know a little) is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply inappropriate.  The appropriate math is Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability theory, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and expansions of expected utility theory.
