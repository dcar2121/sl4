</em><br>
<p>Ooh, ooh, can I have a go at explaining consciousness?
<br>
<p>It has to be some deep 'self-referential' property of
<br>
the universe itself I think.  So I would lean towards
<br>
panpsychism:  there has to be some 'ground state' of
<br>
pure awareness in everything.  My reasoning follows
<br>
from two premises:
<br>
<p>(1)  Everything has to have an explanation
<br>
(2)  There is no analytic/synthetic distinction
<br>
(empirical knowledge is the only kind of knowledge
<br>
there is)
<br>
<p>Given that every THING has to have an explanation, and
<br>
all things exist WITHIN reality (inside the Universe),
<br>
every thing has to be explicable using the tools that
<br>
exist inside reality.  Since the universe itself
<br>
demands an explanation, and the premise was that
<br>
everything has an explanation, we have to classify the
<br>
universe itself as a thing.  From this it follows that
<br>
the universe exists INSIDE the universe (since a
<br>
'thing' by definition is that which exists within
<br>
reality).  The essential unitary nature of the term
<br>
'Universe' defines a 'Self-Similarly' property which 
<br>
exists at all levels to maintain the consistency of
<br>
reality.  (This Self-Similarity property also
<br>
establishes the 'Identity' of the universe).  The
<br>
self-similarity property is also self-referential in
<br>
nature (the universe is self-contained - the universe
<br>
exists INSIDE the universe).  
<br>
<p>Since empirical knowledge is the only kind of
<br>
knowledge there is, at some level 'awareness' itself
<br>
has to be equivalent to some abstract property of the
<br>
physical world.  The 'Identity' of the universe itself
<br>
(the self-referential, self-similarity property) is
<br>
the most likely candidate.
<br>
<p>Asking for the Identity of the Universe is to ask for
<br>
the nature of the Self-Similarity Property alluded to
<br>
above.  It has to be (by definition) the most general
<br>
abstract properties underlying existence (otherwise it
<br>
wouldn't be truly fundamental).  Asking for the most
<br>
general abstract properties defining existence leads
<br>
to the basic laws of logic as the most likely
<br>
candidate  (The laws of logic are implicit in the
<br>
operations of everything).
<br>
<p>The laws of logic:  The law of Identity, The law of
<br>
non-contradiction, The law of the excluded Middle.
<br>
<p>Hypothesis:  Qualia ARE the laws of logic.  There is a
<br>
ground state of pure awareness which exists in
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>Conclusions:  Higher level forms of qualia are
<br>
obtained through multiple recursion of the laws of
<br>
logic.  Brains are the physical expression of the laws
<br>
of logic undergoing multiple levels of recursion to a
<br>
high degree.
<br>
<p>Got all that?  Geez, this is all very basic stuff guys
<br>
;)
