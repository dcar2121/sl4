Hi Ben,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What this thread really leads to is the (obvious) conclusion that we'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be better off to enhance humans for IMPROVED WISDOM before we enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for improved intelligence.  
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely!!!!  
<br>
<p>I wrote my last post before I read this in your last message - but what 
<br>
you have said here is the core of what I was trying to say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Genetically engineering a wiser human&quot; is an excellent transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project. 
</em><br>
<p>*But* I think *this* way to &quot;enhance humans for IMPROVED WISDOM&quot; 
<br>
is just about the most difficult way to do it and leaves unaddressed 
<br>
what I think is the easiest and possibly the most effective way to do it - 
<br>
through the very unsexy processes of improving health and nutrition, 
<br>
education, enculturation and training.  These are the well known (but 
<br>
insufficiently applied) ways to enhance human hardware and software.  
<br>
<p>Using the traditional approaches to the human wisdom enhancement 
<br>
the issue is less one of general method of delivering enhancment but of 
<br>
how to create strategies to get resources put into these activities on the 
<br>
necessary scale.
<br>
<p>I think our most urgent project is enhancing wisdom using the currently 
<br>
available intelligence platform (ie. biological humans versions 20th and 
<br>
early 21st century) - in partnership with the emerging machine 
<br>
intelligence - directed at solving pressing problems in ways that don't 
<br>
just add to the raft of current problems.
<br>
<p>The reason why I think that &quot;genetically engineering a wiser human&quot; is 
<br>
the most difficult path we could follow to boost wisdom is the path 
<br>
between the actions of genes and the output of wisdom must be about 
<br>
the longest possible.  It's a bit like trying to create wise IT systems by 
<br>
talking to Intel about chip design rather than talking to the box 
<br>
developers, sofware developers and the trainers of the users of the 
<br>
software.
<br>
<p>If you could find a way to plug massive accurate modelling capacity in 
<br>
biological humans by figuring out how we could grow a neo-neo-cortex 
<br>
(or whatever) and how we can grow links between minds to achieve 
<br>
stable and reliable distributed mentation - then this sort of modification 
<br>
might make a difference!
<br>
<p>But I don't think this breakthrough (in physical enhancement of 
<br>
humans) is all that critical as we can get nearly the same effect if 
<br>
people and machine modelling intelligences work together using 
<br>
telecommunications as the glue.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
<br>
