</em><br>
<p>I would presently support the flat general rule that things which look 
<br>
like minor problems, but which you don't quite understand, are blocker 
<br>
problems until fathomed completely.  Mostly because of the number of 
<br>
things I have encountered which looked like minor problems, and which I 
<br>
didn't quite understand, and which - as it turned out, after I learned the 
<br>
rules - I desperately needed to understand.
<br>
<p>I don't think there will be a good reason for using probabilistic 
<br>
self-modification techniques, ever.  Deductive self-modification should be 
<br>
quite sufficient.  There's a difference between hope and creating a system 
<br>
that can be rationally predicted to work, and the difference is that hope 
<br>
doesn't help.
<br>
<p>The part about the &quot;rational tradeoff&quot; ignores the fact that until you 
<br>
understand something, you have no idea how much you need to understand it; 
<br>
you are simply guessing.  Every time I see someone try to get away with 
<br>
this guess, including my memories of my past self, they are lethally 
<br>
wrong.  To build an FAI you must aspire to a higher level of understanding 
<br>
than poking around in design space until you find something that appears 
<br>
to work.
<br>
<p>I do not expect anyone who *actually* understands FAI to *ever* use the 
<br>
argument of &quot;We don't understand this, but we'll use it anyway because of 
<br>
&lt;nitwit utilitarian argument&gt;.&quot;  The nitwit argument only applies because 
<br>
the speaker is too ignorant to realize that they have *no* chance of 
<br>
success, that the *only* reason they think they can build an FAI without 
<br>
understanding is that they lack the understanding to know this is impossible.
