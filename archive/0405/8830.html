Philip,
<br>
<p>You did not respond to either of the answers I gave to Mark's question.  You
<br>
wrote about related but different issues... which I would be happy to
<br>
comment on.
<br>
<p>IRT SingInst promoting development of FAI: It is.
<br>
<p>IRT SingInst's control over other people creating AIs: It has no control,
<br>
other than what it can muster using good ideas well presented, and
<br>
reasonable arguments.

Subject: One or more FAIs??
<br>
<p><p>Hi Michael
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From you email:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1.  Why do you believe that a single FAI is the best strategy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MRA: a) It is simpler to create.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) Having one being around with the capability of destroying humanity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less risk than having more than one, in the same way as having one human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being with a Pocket Planetary Destruct (TM) device is less risky than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having more than one.
</em><br>
<p><p>This logic doesn't work at the most basic level.  It seems to me that the
<br>
Singularity Institute will *not* be the first to create an AGI - so the
<br>
Singularity Institute has to actively promote the creation of more than one
<br>
friendly/Friendly AI (ie. including those created by others) - otherwise
<br>
there will be several, possibly not-Friendly AIs and then *later* maybe only
<br>
one FAI (if the SI happens to achieve what it's setting out to achieve).
<br>
<p><p>It seems to the me that the Singularity Institute has to build its
<br>
strategies on the idea that there will be several/many AGIs and that as many
<br>
as possible of them are friendly/Friendly.  Frankly I can't see that the
<br>
Institute has any other realistic choice.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers, Philip
