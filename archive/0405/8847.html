<p>
Natural selection ´bothered´ to create a concious being, but it also 
<br>
bothered to create many other non-concious intelligent beings. Conciousness 
<br>
is a matter of degree, which almost definitely required intelligence but not 
<br>
vice versa (conciousness is emergent of intelligence). Take the rheus 
<br>
monkey, for example, it´s fascinated by pieces of glass that it finds in 
<br>
junkyards yet it always looks behind the glass to find where the other 
<br>
(reflected) monkey is hiding. That demonstrates a degree of conc¡ousness 
<br>
that recognizes the existence of others but not of yourself.
<br>
<p>If we define intelligence simply as &quot;the ability to solve complex problems&quot; 
<br>
then there is no need for conciousness or sentience. We have Automated 
<br>
Theorem provers right now that can tackle fairly sophisticated theorems and 
<br>
that is not to say only Strong-Method solvers but weak ones as well (By 
<br>
weak-method solvers I mean ones that manipulate concepts in a purely 
<br>
syntactical fashion without the need of logical inferencing).
<br>
In short, symbol manipulation, no matter at what level implies intelligence. 
<br>
'Intuition', or 'creativity' can effectively be emulated by such methods 
<br>
without the need of conciousness; they only form part of our mind as 
<br>
heuristic shortcuts (usually by means of association) when not enough 
<br>
computing power is available.

<em>&gt; &gt;If you write one program that solves a problem using brute-force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;method,and another that uses heuristics to arrive at a solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;much faster, is it correct to say that the second one is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;intelligent than the first?  If so, that would be some degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of intelligence without consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You seem to be assuming that intelligence without consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible, or at least, easier to come up with than intelligence with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness. What a strange idea. If that were true why did random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutation and natural selection bother to produce an animal that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conscious in the first place?  Our inner mental lives may be supremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important to us but to evolution only external actions are important; an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligent zombie that acts the same way we do would work just fine from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution’s point of view and there would be no point in going to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trouble to come up with consciousness unless you can’t have intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without consciousness.
