</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;falling asleep later, so I make myself a warm milk instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;OK, but then we shouldn't describe the action as a case of allowing the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;agent's behavior we must look for an alternative rationale.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Either you are using the term &quot;best interest&quot; for something I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not use that term for, or you are making the mistake of assuming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a single objective &quot;best interest&quot; exists which can be determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by an outside observer.
</em><br>
<p>There are multiple viewpoints for &quot;best interest&quot; that are sometimes in 
<br>
conflict.  So the problem may not be solvable at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In order to determine a person's best interest, you would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weigh their options against their goal system (not yours!) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choose the best option which is consistent with that goal system.
</em><br>
<p>Ultimately it is the &quot;goal&quot; of a person's genes to get themselves into the 
<br>
next generation and beyond.  To do so the genes build brains that have 
<br>
psychological traits that--in the past--worked most of the time to get the 
<br>
genes of those bodies and brains down the time stream.  Of course, genes 
<br>
are more remote from day to day behavior than the board of directors of a 
<br>
major company is from a shipping clerk.  Thus brains develop a viewpoint 
<br>
which is sometimes in conflict with the &quot;goal&quot; of a person's genes.
<br>
<p>As an example, consider the celibate priest.  It is possible for genes for 
<br>
celibate behavior to evolve as they did in bees and ants, but there is no 
<br>
evidence that the close relatives of celibate priests do enough better at 
<br>
reproducing to compensate for the loss of the gene copies in the 
<br>
priests.  Besides, priests are post agriculture which is to say way too 
<br>
recent for evolution to have shaped  the psychological traits behind such 
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p>(There should be a reader who can explain the psychological trait behind 
<br>
celibate priests.)
<br>
<p>There is a statement out of evolutionary theory which (paraphrased) says 
<br>
that features and behavior of a species are either the result of direct 
<br>
selection or side effects (spandrels) of features or behaviors that were 
<br>
selected.  Sometimes, such as the behavior of taking addictive drugs, it is 
<br>
clear that the trait is a side effect.  In the case of drug addiction, a 
<br>
side effect of a brain reward system mediated by chemicals.  Some plants 
<br>
make chemicals with a shape close enough to mimic the effects of the 
<br>
natural reward chemicals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unless you are intelligent enough to closely simulate that person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;however (and no human currently is), you are unlikely to be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make such a determination, so you must accept the person's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decisions as the closest approximation to their &quot;best interest&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you can find.
</em><br>
<p>Ten years ago I would have agreed with you.  There is a strong libertarian 
<br>
outlook in me that was shaped by decades of Heinlein's influence.
<br>
<p>But over the past ten years I have come to see &quot;the person&quot; as something 
<br>
less than a unified whole, burdened by evolved psychological traits that 
<br>
may be way out of step with reality.  Gambling, drug addiction and cult 
<br>
involvement, i.e., infection with a parasitic meme, are pathological states 
<br>
where intervention may be justified--not simply because of the damage to 
<br>
the person, but the dangers to the larger community.
<br>
<p>We are *social* primates.  Rational behavior (sanity if you will) is to a 
<br>
considerable extent maintained by interactions with those &quot;in your 
<br>
tribe.&quot;  That being the case, we have self-interest in keeping our 
<br>
neighbors sane, and they in keeping us sane--especially since we have 
<br>
mechanisms that switch on irrational behavior in response to environmental 
<br>
conditions (though &quot;irrational behavior&quot; may be rational from a gene's 
<br>
viewpoint in a hunter gatherer environment--key phrase in Google 
<br>
&quot;xenophobic memes&quot;).
<br>
<p>There really isn't a simple answer.
<br>
<p>To relate this back to the subjects of main interest here, understanding 
<br>
these matters might be essential to providing the environment in which 
<br>
friendly AI can be developed.
