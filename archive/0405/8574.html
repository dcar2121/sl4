'That Don't Impress Me Much' - SL4 version
<br>
<p>I've been meaning to post this for a while; for some reason every time
<br>
Eliezer
<br>
criticises someone else's AI theory I imagine him singing this at an SIAI
<br>
karokee night. Yes, it's based on an awful piece of hypercommercial pop,
<br>
but it seemed to fit. With apologies to Shania Twain.
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
<p>I've known a few researchers who thought they had a clue,
<br>
But you've got toy problems down to an art,
<br>
You think you're AI's Eienstien; you drive me up the wall,
<br>
You're a regular wishful thinker, another Newell.
<br>
<p>Oh-oo-oh, you think you know the secret,
<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you can code it.
<br>
<p>Okay, so you've got an agent system,
<br>
That don't impress me much,
<br>
So you've got layering but where's the cognitive work?
<br>
Don't get me wrong,  yeah I'm sure you'll have apps,
<br>
But that won't save the world from the advance of grey goo,
<br>
That don't impress me much.
<br>
<p>I never knew a coder who who didn't bother to design, 
<br>
And just put loads of neurons... into nets,
<br>
And all that directed evolution supposed to sort it out,
<br>
'Cause Heaven forbid that AI should be transparent.
<br>
<p>Oh-oo-oh, you think you know the secret,
<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you can code it.
<br>
<p>Okay, so you've got a neural net,
<br>
That don't impress me much,
<br>
So you've made it spiking but can you train it?
<br>
Don't get me wrong,  yeah I'm sure you'll have apps,
<br>
But that won't save the world from the advance of grey goo,
<br>
That don't impress me much .
<br>
<p>You're one of those coders who actually likes PROLOG,
<br>
You make me write a formal spec before I touch your IDE,
<br>
I can't believe you think AIXI is a good model,
<br>
C'mon baby tell me; you must be unFriendly, right! 
<br>
<p>Oh-oo-oh, you think you know the secret,
<br>
Oh-oo-oh, you think you can code it.
<br>
<p>Okay, so you know Solomonoff,
<br>
That don't impress me much,
<br>
So you got the maths but is it tractable?
<br>
Don't get me wrong,  yeah I'm sure you'll have apps,
<br>
But that won't save the world from the advance of grey goo,
<br>
That don't impress me much .
<br>
<p>You think you're smart but have you got Bayes?
<br>
Don't get me wrong, yeah I think you're alright,
<br>
But that won't save the world from all the Un... Friendly... AIs.
<br>
That don't impress me much.
<br>
<p>Okay, so what do you think you're Turing or something...
<br>
Whatever,
<br>
That don't impress me...
