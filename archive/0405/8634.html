<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Your below list of consequences was interesting, and I am sure each
<br>
individual will answer them in their own way.  Below are my responses to
<br>
some of your questions/dangers
<br>
<p><p>You wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some examples of possible consequences, off the top
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my head:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've got memories of enjoying cheeseburgers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What happens to the memories when the sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate of recollection shifts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In bio-humans the memories would change.  This happens in human brains
<br>
whenever we learn new information that relates to something we already know.
<br>
The new information subtly alters the recall in ways both predictable and
<br>
unpredictable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to keep the old hardware around for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recollection?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>An uploaded human could chose to do this, if they so desired.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will you add in a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system to maintain empathy with your old self?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Again, an uploaded human could chose to do this, if they so desired.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your old sense of taste was fine-tuned and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrated into your sense of pleasure and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain, happiness and disgust, by natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection.  Natural selection also designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else keyed into those systems.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you pick new senses, do they make sense?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>At first new senses may not make much sense, and would have to be integrated
<br>
into the mind as any other new set of information would be.  On the other
<br>
hand, with a (very) sophisticated installation program, it might be possible
<br>
for new modalities to make perfect sense, and to integrate smoothly with all
<br>
your existing knowledge.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does the pattern subtly clash with the pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of systems already present?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am sure this will happen.  From such clashes great insight and inspiration
<br>
might come.  Or they might just cause confusion and depression.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What does the sharp discontinuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of direct self-alteration do to your sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal continuity?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is one I will not predict.  I am certainly willing to give it a try
<br>
though.  I experience a sharp personal discontinuity every time I fall
<br>
asleep and wake up.  Would a self-alteration be so different?  Could it not
<br>
be more interesting in a positive sense as well as a negative?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the new taste sensation is more intense, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you become addicted to the act of self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modification for more intense sensations?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I suppose this is possible.  It seems that humans can become addicted to
<br>
almost anything.  Addiction is something to avoid strongly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you really appreciate the long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of altering your mind this way?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does the new design you decided upon make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense with respect to those criteria that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would use if you thought about the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long enough?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Figuring out the consequences may probably only be done in a general way,
<br>
without making the actual changes.  Some people will undoubtedly go astray
<br>
after changing themselves - such are the risks of change.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other humans share your current taste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensations.  Think of your awkward refusal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foods at dinner, the mainstream artistry of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooking you'll no longer be able to appreciate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you distancing yourself from the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity?  Lest someone chime in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diversity is automatically good, let me add
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this is one hell of a nontrivial decision.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is an important point, and one that might not be given enough air time
<br>
in a North American audience where individualism reigns.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And finally, what about all the consequences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and categories of consequences, that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't foreseen?  When you imagine the act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of self-modification, you will imagine only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the easily mentally accessible consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the act, not the actual consequences.  Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you can't see the doom, doesn't mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the doom isn't there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, the Availability bias.  This is certainly one to avoid.  Though I must
<br>
play devil's advocate and suggest that we can't stay sitting on the couch
<br>
eating Pringles forever.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  Not to play too
<br>
lightly with this important topic - your overall point is well taken.  Self
<br>
modification is mighty tricky.
<br>
