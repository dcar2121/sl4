<p>Gee, Keith, are you playing the harbinger of doom?  I am eagerly looking
<br>
forward to reprogramming some of the counterproductive goals/desires in my
<br>
own mind... for a trivial example: my desire to consume large quantities of
<br>
bacon, cheese, chocolate and wine.  Why would 'dialing down' my hunger for
<br>
fat, sugar and drugs lead me to doom?
<br>

<em>&gt; You really should read Minsky's society of mind
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; desires on a whim is not a power to be used lightly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can't say I'm a Minsky fan, but I have read his stuff.  Which essay or
<br>
essays are you referring to?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It sometimes seems to me that even SL4 folks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; aren't fully cognizant of the degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incredible pending freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And after you have removed your basic drives just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what are you going to do with that &quot;freedom&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a straw man, Keith.  You bought up 'removal of basic drives'.  Doing
<br>
that doesn't strike me as a thing to do lightly either, but nobody here
<br>
suggested taking such steps &quot;lightly&quot;.  In passing I would note that we
<br>
already do substantial modification of our basic drives through a myriad of
<br>
drugs.  There are drugs to increase or decrease appetite, drugs to prevent
<br>
or encourage sleep, drugs to reduce pain, drugs to prevent nausea... and on
<br>
and on.  Reprogramming would have far fewer side effects, and probably cost
<br>
less once the basic brain modifying infrastructure is in place to do it.
<br>
But this is SL3 territory.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I put it on another thread:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It is a dire and depressing business to realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that genes optimized in the stone age to cope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with periodic privation of hunter gatherers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now pulling strings attached to nukes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Depressing?  Well maybe, if the genes started letting nukes fly.  So far
<br>
they haven't - much.  But aren't you arguing both sides of the issue now?
<br>
Surely it would be preferable to adjust the gene-spun human brains to better
<br>
handle the existential risks they have built for themselves, n'est-il pas?
