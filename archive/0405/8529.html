<em>&gt;Hi Keith,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think conditionally triggered responses are likely to be plentiful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans as you suspect.
</em><br>
<p>Probably.  Only a subclass is dangerous (I hope).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just on the issue of cruelty to captives - I think the response is most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely uniquely triggered by the mindset in which the captive is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considered.  We can care lovingly for our captive pigeons or rabbits in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their cages OR treat the captives like things.  It depends whether we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are promed to see them as 'animate and ALSO in the family' or as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'mere things'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The quote below gives a hint that the perceptual pre-positioning is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crucial:

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; Even Kimmitt admitted, &quot;I'd like to sit here and say these are the

<em>&gt; &gt; other ones since we have been here in Iraq.&quot; I just don't believe soldiers
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; young people. The word is: DEHUMANIZATION. It happened in Vietnam. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still happening. For a soldier to call an Iraqi a human--unacceptable. Can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you even train a person to kill other humans rather haphazardly? I don't
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human beings. No, they are killing things, bugs, irrelevant living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creatures. Isn't this the attitude reflected in these photos?
</em><br>
<p>That's certainly one aspect I considered.  &quot;keith henson&quot; dehumanizing in 
<br>
Google will find thoughts about dehumanizing memes over a year ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I saw similar pictures as these in the Winter Soldier hearings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Soldiers had not just killed the enemy and murdered people. They had gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the hunt, and successfully bagged their prey. Imagine hunters throwing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their ducks on the back of their pickup truck. Imagine a fisherman having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his picture taken while standing next to his big fish hanging on a hook.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Imagine soldiers throwing their enemy in piles and having their pictures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taken giving a big &quot;thumbs up&quot; to the people at home. Oops--you don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to imagine that, we saw it on 60 Minutes. This is war. War is not pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or noble. This is what we are training our young people to do in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From: <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/rejman05012004.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/rejman05012004.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>We train them, and it's not hard to do.  Why?  Because working the warriors 
<br>
of a tribe up to go kill a neighboring tribe was the way your genes 
<br>
survived hard times for a million years.  What we do today though is 
<br>
*frustrate* the tribal trait to just kill all the men in aa attacked tribe 
<br>
and take the women for booty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I found the book &quot;Religion explained&quot; useful in helping to identify some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;underlying mental architecture that conditions how we see/respond to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things outside ourselves. (Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Religious Thought by Pascal Boyer (April 2002)
</em><br>
<p>Excellent book.  I have cited it 27 times according to Google.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the comment, I think you are spot on.  If you can figure out any 
<br>
way to spread out this knowledge, please do and let me know how successful 
<br>
you are.  Ghod knows  we and our leaders need better insight into what is 
<br>
going on.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
