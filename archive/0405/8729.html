<em>&gt; Exactly. The comparison I draw is with the Weather

</em><br>
<em>&gt; all smarter than Newton, and just maybe it buys you an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra day of reliability. This isn't even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controversial issue any more. More intelligence does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not add entropy. But it can sure get outrun by it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>These responses have missed an important part of the point, which originally
<br>
stated was:
<br>
<p>&quot;Intelligence is the power to know more accurately and choose between
<br>
futures.  When you look at it from an information-theoretical standpoint,
<br>
intelligence reduces entropy and produces information, both in internal
<br>
models relative to reality, and in reality relative to a utility function.&quot;
<br>
(Eliezer)
<br>
<p>Ben and Thomas acknowledge the ability of intelligence to make more accurate
<br>
predictions - great, we all agree on that.  The part that was missed is that
<br>
intelligence has the ability to change the future through its own action.
<br>
Intelligence, taking actions in pursuit of goals, reduces entropy from an
<br>
information-theoretical viewpoint because it constrains the universe down a
<br>
path of its choosing.  The 'forecast' analogy, as presented, does not hold
<br>
because the weather system contains no intelligence.  If a substantial
<br>
portion of the Earth's atmosphere was composed of a kind of Atmospheric
<br>
Utility Fog (AUF) optimized for weather control, then the 'forecast' analogy
<br>
would apply.  The difference between Satellites &amp; Meteorologists as opposed
<br>
to AUF is that AUF is intelligent and takes actions toward goals.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, intelligent systems can learn, and become more intelligent,
<br>
thus gaining more ability to channel the future in ever narrower directions
<br>
of their choosing.  This is the reason why we are all here trying to figure
<br>
out how to build AI without burning ourselves.
