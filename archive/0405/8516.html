<p><em>&gt; Prof. Hanson's paper both predicts economic effects of future artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence as well as the current effects of computerized automation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs formerly performed by humans that we are witnessing today. In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Abstract to his paper, Hanson writes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Eventually, computers do most jobs. At first, complementary effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominate, and human wages rise with computer productivity. But eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substitution can dominate, making wages fall as fast as computer prices now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do. An intelligence population explosion makes per-intelligence consumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fall this fast, while economic growth rates rise by an order of magnitude or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more. These results are robust to automating incrementally, and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguishing hardware, software, and human capital from other forms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capital.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Hanson is correct and wages fall as fast as computer prices do now, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in for a bumpy ride during a historical transition period.
</em><br>
<p>### You might want to consider whether the absolute levels of 
<br>
consumption would follow the changes in wages.
<br>
<p>Please consider this quotation, p.3., second paragraph from bottom: &quot;A 
<br>
Malthusian analysis of population is appropriate for this era, and 
<br>
per-intelligence consumption levels fall rapidly. Per-human consumption
<br>
levels can rise rapidly, however, if humans own a Ô¨Åxed fraction of capital.&quot;
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(For purposes
<br>
<em>&gt; of this discussion, let's stipulate that computer prices fall slower than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moore's Law but track that Law.) Since consumption depends on income (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is mostly wages for most &quot;people,&quot; or as Hanson has it, &quot;intelligences&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including non-human ones) then per capita consumption will drop.
</em><br>
<p>### This stipulation is not a part of Hanson's model, and as noted 
<br>
above, its result (human per capita consumption drop), is not predicted.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
<br>
<em>&gt; with the &quot;intelligence population explosion&quot; Hanson predicts, there may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so many more new intelligences that aggregate consumption will increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormously. Which is a good thing, since someone has to buy the output of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy that is growing at least ten times faster than today's mature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postindustrial economies (which average an annual growth rate of between 2%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 4%). If economies suddenly were to grow by 20% to 40% annually while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual consumers saw their incomes **dropping** there would be large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential for social unrest. Of course, if prices for most essential goods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and services (food, clothing, medical care, education, etc.) were to drop as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast as or faster than wages did, the situation would not be dire. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the super-high-tech economy were also producing relatively expensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; luxury goods (like &quot;gotta have&quot; electronics) that lay far beyond the price
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range affordable to most wage earners, there could still be a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stratification that might undermine social peace.
</em><br>
<p>### Your analysis fits well into the conventional thinking that seems to 
<br>
dominate this field (see Marshall Brain and his musings). However, it is 
<br>
crucially dependent on conventional assumptions, such as the assumption 
<br>
that human income will continue to be derived from wages. Historically, 
<br>
the fraction of individual income derived directly from an investment of 
<br>
labor (which in social situations frequently takes the form of wages), 
<br>
has been steadily going down. While our ancestors in the EEA derived 
<br>
essentially all their resources from labor (which perhaps left some mark 
<br>
on our way of thinking about labor vs. capital investment), modern 
<br>
Americans derive a substantial fraction of income from capital 
<br>
investment. This trend is a reflection of the fact that capital (e.g. in 
<br>
the form of machines, or organizational schemes)) is becoming more and 
<br>
more important in production of goods and services. At the same time, 
<br>
non-labor forms of capital are becoming cheaper in absolute terms (i.e. 
<br>
per unit of output).
<br>
<p>These trends will become even more pronounced as AI technology matures. 
<br>
The fraction of output directly attributable to labor will trend towards 
<br>
zero while absolute output is skyrocketing, the ownership of capital 
<br>
sufficient for sustenance becomes ubiquitous, and therefore human 
<br>
consumption will grow, in direct contradiction of the conventional wisdom.
<br>
<p>The main objection to this prediction, raised by Hanson (with whom I 
<br>
agree), is that the rise of uploads legally capable of exercising 
<br>
ownership rights *and* psychological self-modification may result in a 
<br>
situation where the vast majority of legally enfranchised sentients 
<br>
evolved to put maximum value on self-replication, rather than personal 
<br>
income growth. In that case indeed the average per human income might be 
<br>
reduced - but this would be irrelevant to the issue of political 
<br>
stability, as humans would be a insignificant minority, incapable of 
<br>
disrupting the society.
