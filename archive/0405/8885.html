<p>Thou'rt welcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From your mention at many points in the essay of controlled shutdown,

<p>Er, that's just while the programmers are gradually developing the young 
<br>
Optimization Process.  It's not an &quot;evil AI out of control&quot; measure.  I 
<br>
speak of an Optimization Process that doesn't optimize systems for which it 
<br>
doesn't have a clear decision function.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it seems to me that you are gravitating rather rapidly to the position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I instinctively have on FAI, which is that a true FAI will do very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little indeed in the way of altering our environment but will concern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself strictly with pre-empting events that cause huge loss of life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any &quot;interference&quot; in more minor matters will be seen (by it, if not

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hence my suggestion that the collective volition would not optimize details 
<br>
of individual life, but choose a set of collective background rules.  I 
<br>
don't see why this means not altering the environment.  People live with 
<br>
quite complex background rules already, such as &quot;You must spend most of 
<br>
your hours on boring, soul-draining labor just to make enough money to get 
<br>
by&quot; and &quot;As time goes on you will slowly age, lose neurons, and die&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;You need to fill out paperwork&quot; and &quot;Much of your life will be run by 
<br>
people who enjoy exercising authority over you and huge bureaucracies you 
<br>
can't affect.&quot;  Moral caution or no, even I could design a better set of 
<br>
background rules than that.  It's not as if any human intelligence went 
<br>
into designing the existing background rules; they just happened.
<br>
<p>&quot;Self-determination&quot; can be described in an information-theoretic sense; a 
<br>
small set of collective background rules is a small amount of information, 
<br>
while messing with tiny details of six billion lives is a huge amount of 
<br>
information.  Changing the collective background rules might change 
<br>
individual lives but it wouldn't interfere with self-determination; you'd 
<br>
just go on steering your own future on the new playing field.
<br>
<p>As for *which particular* background rules I would design, to speak of that 
<br>
would be sheer hypocrisy, as I have already said that to speak of this on 
<br>
the SL4 mailing list would require a $10 donation to talk for 48 hours, $50 
<br>
for a month, etc.
<br>
<p>But this business of a planetary death rate of 150,000 deaths per day has 
<br>
got to stop.  *Now*.  You have to be alive to worry about the philosophical 
<br>
importance of self-determination.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we assume the above, the question that would seem to be epistatic to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all others is whether the risks to life inherent in attempting to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a FAI (because one might build an unfriendly one) outweigh the benefits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that success would give in reducing other risks to life.  So, what are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those benefits? -- how would the FAI actually pre-empt loss of life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Browsing Nick Bostrom's essay on existential risks, and in particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;bangs&quot; category, has confirmed my existing impression that bangs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involving human action are far more likely than ones only involving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human inaction (such as asteroid impacts).  Hence, the FAI's job is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stop humans from doing risky things.
</em><br>
<p>Or change the background rules such that risky things don't wipe out whole 
<br>
planets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here's where I get stuck: how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does the FAI have the physical (as opposed to the cognitive) ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do this?
</em><br>
<p>Molecular nanotechnology, one would tend to assume, or whatever follows 
<br>
after; nanotech seems sufficient unto the task, but perhaps an SI can do 
<br>
better.  My median estimate on the time required to bang together nanotech 
<br>
out of available odds and ends of human civilization, a median estimate 
<br>
which I freely admit to be manufactured of entire air, would be three days. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is based on the fastest method of which I can think, which might 
<br>
equally prove too pessimistic or too optimistic (note blatant abuse of 
<br>
Principle of Indifference).
<br>
<p>Three days is 450,000 deaths, and at a million-to-one speedup 8,361 years, 
<br>
so I hope I missed the many obvious ways to do it faster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely only by advising other humans on what actions THEY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should take to stop the risky actions: any other method would involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopping us doing things without our agreeing on their riskiness, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violates the self-determination criterion.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, c'mon, respecting self-determination doesn't require an FAI to be 
<br>
*that* much of a wimp.  There isn't that much self-determination in today's 
<br>
world to respect.  The average character in a science-fiction novel gets to 
<br>
make far more interesting choices than a minimum-wage worker; you could 
<br>
transport the entire human species into an alternate dimension based on a 
<br>
randomly selected anime and increase the total amount of self-determination 
<br>
going on.  Not that I am advocating this, mind you; we can do better than 
<br>
that.  I only say that if human self-determination is desirable, we need 
<br>
some kind of massive planetary intervention to increase it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But surely that is a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gaping hole in the whole idea, because the humans who obtain the FAI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advice can take it or leave it, just as Kennedy could take or leave the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advice he received during the Cuba missile crisis.  The whole edifice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relies, surely, on people voting for people who respect the advice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the FAI more than that of human advisors.  That may well happen, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not be very well publicised, to say the least.
</em><br>
<p>I can't see this scenario as real-world stable, let alone ethical.
