<p>
The issue of &quot;messing with source code&quot; arises with genetic 
<br>
engineering.
<br>
<p>The problem I think stems from failing to distinguish consciously 
<br>
enough between directly-determined versus emergent behaviours.
<br>
<p>If a system has a module with a stand alone function and the source 
<br>
code for that module is isolatable then we should be able to upgrade 
<br>
the module without mucking up the rest of the system.  But if the 
<br>
property we want to change is the result of subtle interplay between 
<br>
many systems and may have emerged in the first place as a bit of 
<br>
evolutionary serendipity, *and* the system we are dealing with is 
<br>
immensely complicated, then it will be most likely be exceptionally 
<br>
difficult to determine the causation of the emergent behaviour and it 
<br>
might be near enough to impossible to change the behaviour of interest 
<br>
without stuffing up other needed behaviours.
<br>
<p>If people want to upload and then enhance themselves more than 
<br>
trivially then the science that allows uploading might *first* have to work 
<br>
out how to *emulate* humans with a code structure that is more 
<br>
amenable to upgrading than the coding method developed via historical 
<br>
biological evolution.
<br>
<p>So the first uploading technology might well be one where self-
<br>
modification is effectively *not* possible (due to the massive risk of 
<br>
serious failure). The option for personal self-modification might have to 
<br>
await the capacity to reconfigure the code for an uploaded human using 
<br>
a code system designed specifically to maximally facilitate successful 
<br>
self-modification.
<br>
<p>My guess if that the development of a coding system to facilitate 
<br>
successful self-modification will be cracked first for AGIs.
<br>
<p>As an aside, I think that anyone who thinks they can get humanity into 
<br>
the drivers seat of the Singularity before AGIs get there will be sorely 
<br>
disappointed.  So working out how ordinary biological humans can live 
<br>
comfortably with powerful (most likely sefl-modifiying) AGI is the first 
<br>
issue to crack before worrying about human uploading.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
