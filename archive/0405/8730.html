</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that the realistic and frightened medieval alchemist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually has no way of knowing that concocting an immortality serum is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible.   We know that NOW because of the science we've accumulated,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; than now....  Alchemy is idiotic only in hindsight, which is why someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as brilliant as Isaac Newton was an avid alchemist.
</em><br>
<p>So the second alchemist, having triumphantly proved that he is genuinely 
<br>
ignorant of the difficulty, drinks his immortality potion and dies.  What's 
<br>
wrong with this picture?
<br>
<p>This is why it is important never to place yourself in a situation where 
<br>
you have something to gain by proving your ignorance.
<br>
<p>If the realistic and frightened alchemist happens to be a Bayesian 
<br>
rationalist with a history of science to study, it's straightforward enough 
<br>
in hindsight (once you realize the danger exists) to notice that nobody has 
<br>
any legitimate reason to expect an immortality serum to pop out of randomly 
<br>
mixing chemicals.  Or think that the difficulty of mixing an immortality 
<br>
serum might be comparable to the difficulty of building an airplane.  Or 
<br>
compare heartwarming mystical thinking about immortality serums to 
<br>
heartwarming mystical thinking about vitalism.  Or to observe that 
<br>
present-day alchemy is a field in chaos, with many facts known, but the 
<br>
generalizations mystical, heartwarming, and unpredictive.  The mistake is 
<br>
obvious in retrospect and once I caught myself at it - my previous self's 
<br>
triumphant ignorance of the Singularity or the nature of consciousness - 
<br>
the mistake also becomes obvious looking forward.
<br>
<p>No, Isaac Newton didn't see the stupidity of alchemy.  Isaac Newton had a 
<br>
much shorter scientific history to study.  Newton did not read about 
<br>
evolutionary psychology, vitalism, Bayes (Laplace, actually), or Thomas 
<br>
Kuhn.  I am sick and tiring of hearing about allegedly smart people who 
<br>
made mistake XYZ.  Isaac Newton was irrational?  Fine.  Do you suppose that 
<br>
no one is ever allowed to do better, lest it diminish the luster of sacred 
<br>
Newton's name?  Humanity has moved on, and today's geniuses may aspire to 
<br>
higher standards.  It's not like Isaac Newton applied his genius to the 
<br>
mathematics of rationality.  I have more shoulders to stand on, and I can 
<br>
do better than that.
<br>
<p>Rationality is not an innate talent, though it depends strongly on innate 
<br>
talent.  Training the innate talent requires knowledge humanity has only 
<br>
recently discovered, not known to Newton's day.  And learning the art of 
<br>
rationality requires changing yourself as a person, an inconvenience to 
<br>
which few scientists are willing to subject themselves.  It is so much more 
<br>
fun to leave the map blank, for then you can draw in the heartwarming lands 
<br>
you would like to see.
<br>
<p>If alchemy was less visibly stupid in medieval times, it is because there 
<br>
was no history of science to tell worried alchemists the folly of 
<br>
heartwarming ignorance, or the improbability of specific complex miracles, 
<br>
or that Nature does not need to convince you of the danger before She is 
<br>
allowed to kill you.  Today that is not a valid excuse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; There is too much science.  Funny, how the people asserting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ignorance of science on some subject are so rarely specialists in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; *particular* field...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am a specialist in the field of dynamical systems (at least, I was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years back, I published in the field, knew all the literature, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.).  So I think I know basically what is known about the attractors, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminal attractors, invariant measures, etc. of complex systems.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it ain't nearly enough to tell us anything about the attractors etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that complex self-modifying AI's will get into.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly enough, my &quot;too much science&quot; quote was cribbed from an 
<br>
unpublished work which reads:
<br>
<p>&quot;How could anyone possibly state with confidence that science did not know 
<br>
a thing, if he were not a specialist in that field?  And even then, outside 
<br>
specialists might know detailed technical answers to questions that you 
<br>
fancied untouched mysteries of your own field.  I had lost track of the 
<br>
number of papers I had read, offering up as mysteries questions another 
<br>
field had solved.  And when someone gave their favorite mystery as proof of 
<br>
humanity's ignorance, more commonly than not there would be entire journals 
<br>
devoted to the answer, a depth of technical knowledge that stretched back 
<br>
for decades, international conferences and research institutes.  There 
<br>
might be multiple fields of science devoted to separate parts of the 
<br>
question.  Science was a huge edifice, already vastly more than any lone 
<br>
human could absorb, and it kept on accumulating.  No one could say what 
<br>
science did not know.  There was too much science.  One needed to train 
<br>
oneself to always ask if a mystery might already have a known answer, 
<br>
rather than incredulously saying, 'But how could anyone know that?'  For 
<br>
seven-eighths of the time, someone would.  That was what it meant to live 
<br>
in a world of billions of individuals, rather than a hunter-gatherer tribe 
<br>
of two hundred.&quot;
<br>
<p>In this case the math of dynamical systems (of which I do know a little) is 
<br>
simply inappropriate.  The appropriate math is Bayesian probability theory, 
<br>
and expansions of expected utility theory.
