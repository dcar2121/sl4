<em>&gt; I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confident that my intution will crush Eliezer and Ben, just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like it did all of the other aca-dummmies that came up against me.
</em><br>
<p>Dude, why do you think you're the only one with an intuition?
<br>
<p>I'm sure you're a clever, knowledgeable and highly intuitive bloke, but
<br>
there are plenty of us around.
<br>
<p>Remember the Eric Clapton album &quot;There's One in Every Town&quot;?  The
<br>
original title was &quot;The Greatest Guitarist in the World -- There's One
<br>
in Every Town&quot;, but the record company  made him change it because they
<br>
thought the average listener would be too dumb to understand the irony
<br>
of the title.
<br>
<p>The history of the human race shows that nobody's intuition has ever
<br>
been quite as good as you think yours is.  As a case in point, Einstein
<br>
had a hell of a great intuition, but his intuition about quantum theory
<br>
was wrong (he thought the EPR experiment was a disproof of quantum
<br>
physics, for example; and he spent years waddling down a dead-end path
<br>
to unified physics.)
<br>
<p>It's hard to escape the conclusion that you're suffering from &quot;delusions
<br>
of grandeur.&quot;  Not that this implies you're not grand -- perhaps you
<br>
are, and perhaps you'll accomplish great things, even world-changing
<br>
things, who knows -- but your hyperconfidence in your own intuition does
<br>
not seem to be rational.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
