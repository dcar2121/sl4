<p>
For interested parties...
<br>
<p>Michael Anissimov here, got in from the American Humanists Association 
<br>
2004 conference (<a href="http://www.americanhumanist.org/conference/index.html">http://www.americanhumanist.org/conference/index.html</a>) 
<br>
in Las Vegas the day before yesterday and am finally orienting myself.  
<br>
I feel obligated to give my fellow transhumanist colleagues, mentors, 
<br>
advisors, and acquaintances the low-down on the conference and my 
<br>
experiences there.  I feel that transhumanism and humanism are two 
<br>
gigantic puzzle pieces slowly merging into one another, and it is up to 
<br>
us to ensure that these pieces fit into each other smoothly.  I 
<br>
especially hold transhumanists to high standards in the areas of 
<br>
diplomacy and maximizing our positive PR.
<br>
<p>The conference was similar in size to Transvision 2003, with around 300 
<br>
or so attendees and around 25 people giving talks or receiving awards.  
<br>
It was held in the conference area of a Stardust Casino and Hotel.  If 
<br>
you've ever been to Vegas, you've probably heard of it.  Wayne Newton 
<br>
sings there.  The casino smoke irritated my eyes horribly, I should have 
<br>
worn goggles or something.  No utility fog to create a smoke-free bubble 
<br>
to walk around in.  *Sigh*.  My lodging was at a dirt cheap, $16/night 
<br>
hostel in a bad downtown neighborhood.  I did the entire 4-day trip on 
<br>
about $300, amazingly enough.  Big thanks to all the anonymous 
<br>
contributors who helped me raise that money, especially to a certain 
<br>
ImmInst member who donated $150 and Misha Anissimov who donated $50.  
<br>
(Want to help send me to Transvision this August?  Feel free to send me 
<br>
an email.)
<br>
<p>I was welcomed to the conference by AHA employees Jende Huang, Farhad 
<br>
Shakerin, and another nice young woman around my age (whose name I 
<br>
forgot...sorry!) who turned out to be a vegan.  As I said in my earlier 
<br>
report, many of the conference-goers were quite elderly but lively and 
<br>
passionate for their age.  A few conference-goers came up to me and said 
<br>
how happy they were to see a young face at the conference.  (Like 
<br>
Transvision, I was probably the youngest attendee at the conference.)  
<br>
Many of the conference-goers seemed to know each other very well and I 
<br>
can only assume that they have been going to these conferences for many 
<br>
years.  The AHA was originally founded in 1941 and this was their 63rd 
<br>
conference.
<br>
<p>At the entrance to the conference was a whiteboard that said &quot;Las Vegas 
<br>
is a Sin-Free Zone&quot; and had a bunch of the signatures of conference 
<br>
attendees.  Later that night I went back to my hostel and wrote the 
<br>
following:
<br>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<p>&quot;Las Vegas is not a city of &quot;sin&quot;.  The concept of &quot;sin&quot; is religious.  
<br>
But it is a city that contains and encourages a great deal of 
<br>
self-destructive and morally negative choices.  This cannot be denied.
<br>
<p>The city contains many pawn shops, merchants who will purchase your 
<br>
gold, jewelry, and other valuables in exchange for cash.  Where does the 
<br>
cash go?  To fuel gambling, drinking, and whore binges, no doubt.  
<br>
Sorry, but I can't call that morally right.
<br>
<p>And what about the many &quot;escorts&quot; for sale at any time of night or day 
<br>
in any part of the city?  Girls who accept money for sex with anyone, 
<br>
not because they like the job, but because they're desperate for the money?
<br>
<p>Las Vegas is a city that exploits human weaknesses for the maximum 
<br>
possible profit.  It's hard for me to appreciate the beautiful 
<br>
architecture of many of these fancy casinos when I consider what is 
<br>
paying for their construction.
<br>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<p>The above shouldn't be considered &quot;self-righteous&quot;; to the contrary, it 
<br>
should be considered self-evident.  Anyway...
<br>
<p>My talk was &quot;Why You Need to Know About Transhumanism&quot;.  The audience 
<br>
was only about 30 people, sadly.  The audience reading this email is 
<br>
probably several times as large.  About the same as my &quot;Accelerating 
<br>
Progress and the Potential Consequences of Transhuman Intelligence&quot; talk 
<br>
at Transvision 2003.
<br>
<p>&lt;self-promotional memetic engineering&gt;
<br>
In the future, if I'm speaking at a conference you happen to be 
<br>
attending *cough*Transvision04*cough*, I'd appreciate it if you'd 
<br>
consider showing up!  I'm getting better at public speaking, really!
<br>
&lt;/self-promotional memetic engineering&gt;
<br>
<p>There were two other talks going on at the same time. One about the evil 
<br>
of the conservatives and the other about the adventures of a humanist 
<br>
pornography writer, which lured most of the conference-goers away from 
<br>
my session.  Oh well.  I spoke for about 20 minutes, emphasized that 
<br>
transhumanists were humanistic and strongly espouse values that respect 
<br>
the autonomy of the individual. I mentioned that we discourage the 
<br>
notion of social stratification or human vs. transhuman coalitionism, 
<br>
marking these as evolved tendencies we might want to discard once we 
<br>
have the technology to improve our neurology. 
<br>
<p>I gave quick summaries of issues that transhumanists care about - 
<br>
biotech and genetic engineering, life extension, nanotechnology, 
<br>
emotional reengineering, and self-improving artificial intelligence.  I 
<br>
emphasized that there exist a *broad spectrum* of transhumanists who 
<br>
hold a wide range of different opinions on all these issues.  We're a 
<br>
*family* of evolving worldviews, not a single evolving worldview, or, 
<br>
dare I say it, a static worldview.  For the next 30 minutes or so, we 
<br>
did a Q&amp;A session, and people asked some interesting questions along 
<br>
with some off-topic questions.  Although 90% of the audience seemed to 
<br>
be over 60, they seemed quite forward-looking and many of them had heard 
<br>
about transhumanism before that day. 
<br>
<p>A copy of &quot;The Humanist&quot; with George Dvorsky's wonderful article was in 
<br>
every conference packet (!) and I think that really helped prime the 
<br>
talk.  It's cool how he portrays transhumanism as a cultural phenomenon 
<br>
that goes beyond a simple focus on the future, and I concur that stuff 
<br>
like converting to veggy-ism can be considered a form of 
<br>
self-improvement.   (Consider going all the way and becoming a vegan 
<br>
next, George!  Do you know what they do with all the male chicks that 
<br>
are born in egg-producing factories?  Pile them in bags until they crush 
<br>
each other and suffocate, then they toss 'em into blenders.  Better 
<br>
cross your fingers and *hope* their neurology can't support the 
<br>
formation of pain qualia, hm?)
<br>
<p>Many of the talk attendees were very focused on the issue of 
<br>
overpopulation, and I suggested the options of arcologies, sea cities, 
<br>
hollowing out large portions of underground, or mass migrating into 
<br>
outer space using buckytube elevators.  I cited the &quot;First World Effect&quot; 
<br>
and the declining birth rate as women are better educated.  I also 
<br>
mentioned that the right technology would allow modification of our 
<br>
digestive systems so we could theoretically extract nutrients from 
<br>
anything with chemical bonds, if need be.  Many of the younger attendees 
<br>
(ages 30-60) seemed enthusiastic, along with a fair portion of the 
<br>
seniors.  I have a feeling that nearly all of the people who didn't care 
<br>
about transhumanism simply attended the other talks, so I didn't really 
<br>
get to see them. 
<br>
<p>The Q&amp;A session was really fun - there was one super-enthusiastic, 
<br>
greying Buddhist man sitting up in the front. He seemed like someone who 
<br>
had travelled extensively and was familiar with a range of cultures.  He 
<br>
gestured wildly to the audience after I called on him to ask a 
<br>
&quot;question&quot; on several occasions, asserting that we need &quot;radical 
<br>
solutions such as transhumanism!&quot; to adequately confront future risks 
<br>
and the problem of overpopulation.  He discussed the value of meditation 
<br>
and lovingkindness in contrast with transhumanism, all in his 3-minute 
<br>
&quot;question&quot;.  (&quot;Questions&quot; during conference talks are often more like 
<br>
personal mini-speeches.) I was very impressed.
<br>
<p>Some audience members asked which books or websites they should 
<br>
recommend to their children or grandchildren, and I recommended &quot;The Age 
<br>
of Spiritual Machines&quot;, transhumanism.org, and imminst.org.  After the 
<br>
talk, 3 people came up to me and said they liked my talk and would look 
<br>
further into transhumanist issues.  One sweet lady who turned out to be 
<br>
an editor for a retiree's health magazine (and former professor) asked 
<br>
for some information about me personally and said she was considering an 
<br>
article on me and transhumanism.  On the days of the conference when I 
<br>
didn't give my talk, few people made conversation with me but I did have 
<br>
a few brief conversations on evolution and scientific issues.  I agreed 
<br>
with them on 
<br>
issues regarding the stupidity of Bush and the war and so on.  I did not 
<br>
attend the conference buffets or award ceremonies because 1) I couldn't 
<br>
afford it, and 2) I doubt I would have fit in very well anyway - these 
<br>
seemed to be close-knit, long-time activists.
<br>
<p>That's about it.  I am now happy to return from dirty and fake Las Vegas 
<br>
to my wonderful home town of San Francisco, California and all my 
<br>
transhumanist friends on the internet and IRL.  I feel encouraged that 
<br>
many humanists are interested in transhumanist issues, and look forward 
<br>
to continued dialogue and cooperation between adherents of both 
<br>
philosophies in years to come.  But this weekend, it's off to Foresight 
<br>
and the first SF Bay Area Transhumanist meeting for me!
