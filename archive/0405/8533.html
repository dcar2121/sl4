Michael,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that what-is-in-a-person's-interests cannot always be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equated with what-the-person-presently-wants.  But I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you omitted mentioning the cases where a person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understands that their future wants will be different, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors that into their decision-making process.  I do this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the time, and I'm sure you do also.  Eg: Though I desire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an espresso now, I know that if I drink one I'll have trouble 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falling asleep later, so I make myself a warm milk instead.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but then we shouldn't describe the action as a case of allowing the
<br>
agent to do what she wants to do. Suppose I know I will be probably
<br>
ruined if I continue gambling, but I decide to do it anyway. I'm then
<br>
doing what is not in my best interest to do. I'm then acting
<br>
irrationally. Eliezer's maxim, then, becomes inapplicable. To assess the
<br>
agent's behavior we must look for an alternative rationale.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I suggest that it is irrelavent to the application of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volitional morality for third parties to consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what-is-in-a-person's-interest.  We should respect the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volition of what-the-person-presently-wants regardless of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether or not it is in their interest, present or future.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eg: I desire an espresso, and even though I'll have trouble 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falling asleep later, I really love my strong coffee so I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a double.
</em><br>
<p>Nothing inherently wrong with that, except that it requires
<br>
argumentation. If we care about the person, why do we only consider a
<br>
temporal phase of his? Why do we listen to his present desire to ruin
<br>
his future temporal phases, and not to the future desires he will have
<br>
NOT to have acted in a way that will have cost him his health, his
<br>
wealth, and his happiness?
<br>
<p>Maybe it's time to abandon normative individualism? Maybe the
<br>
fundamental units of moral/prudential assessment are not persons, but
<br>
temporal phases? Maybe good and bad ultimately exist only in such
<br>
unidimensional &quot;locations&quot;? I'm just speculating; these are very
<br>
difficult philosophical issues. Bostrom's brilliant recent piece, 'The
<br>
Paralysis of Aggregative Ethics...', tangentially touches some of them.
<br>
For more in-depth treatment, Derek Parfit's Reasons and Persons and John
<br>
Broome's Weighing Goods may be consulted.
