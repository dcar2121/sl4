<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Can you tell me how would *you* would envisage we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*wisdom* via genetic engineering??
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1) Engineer an emotional and not just intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;scientific method. Ever though it works great,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution never gave us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the ability to love the scientific method in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gut because for all its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;virtues it works too slowly to help much in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surviving in the jungle; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;controlled experiment examining the consequences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;running from a Saber Toothed Tiger is not a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idea.  This lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;respect is the reason we believe in spoon benders,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flying saucers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;racism, the image of The Virgin seen in a pizza
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topping, and God.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;2) Engineer a visceral understanding of statistics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Flying is the safest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;way to travel yet many people feel safer driving a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;statistically it is more dangerous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;3) In general, when we recognize that one of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feelings is irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we should always have the ability to change it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example: Fear of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;snakes is a good idea, fear of all snakes is not;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fear of falling is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;good idea, fear of working on the 24?th floor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	I think for 1&amp;2, its well beyond the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability of genetic engineering to do so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforwardly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Both statistics and the scientific method 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are ideas that act at the level of high level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract thought. While I can conceive of it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being possible to somehow re-engineer humanity to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better balance cognitive judgements with sensory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases etc, I don't think its possible to choose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what those cognitive judgements will be. To reuse 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone elses metaphor, its like trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce particular computer GUIs in the chip 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	The last point is an interesting one. Its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never going to be genetic engineering alone that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieves this, and I think its highly likely that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic engineering will have very little to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with whats essentially a psychological question. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But even if we have such an ability, I thinks its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely that it will ever be restricted to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to chance only to feelings that are MORE 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational, though many of us will try to use it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that way. I think it far more likely that, for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every 1 person that has a genuine phobia and can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remove it, we get 10 that try to re-engineer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own personal responses to fit in with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demands of their personal relationships, to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve job prospects, and other personal goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which nevertheless seem terribly important to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the individuals concerned).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Cheers

<p>While I agree with what is written here, I think we
<br>
already have many methods for achieving good results
<br>
that are simply not being used. For example, in NLP
<br>
(neurolinguistic programming) there is something
<br>
called the Fast Phobia Technique which purports to get
<br>
rid of phobias in a single session by training
<br>
deliberately rearranging the sensory modalities
<br>
associated with a fearful memory. Apparently (I say
<br>
this because I don't have any interesting phobias to
<br>
test it on, myself) it works very well. If Jane and
<br>
John Q. Public suddenly started using NLP, Wenger
<br>
methods such as Image Streaming, EFT, E-Prime speech,
<br>
and other such mind-stretching methods, the changes in
<br>
our society would be revolutionary and healthy. It's
<br>
available. Everything I just listed is free or cheap
<br>
(as in buying a few books or tapes). It's just not
<br>
common knowledge.
<br>
<p>My stepson is a chiropractor, and a very good one.
<br>
When he straightens my neck out after I've driven 200
<br>
miles, I feel energized and somewhat more able to
<br>
think clearly. He says this is because 90% of the
<br>
human nervous system is devoted to walking upright and
<br>
keeping the eyes on the horizon. If you write
<br>
symphonies, build moon rockets, and cure cancer, it's
<br>
with the 10% that's left over. If your back is out,
<br>
you have a headache, and you're half awake, that 10%
<br>
dwindles alarmingly. Humans are not just brains in a
<br>
body; the body is an integral part of the mind/brain.
<br>
That's just how we are built.
<br>
<p>Win Wenger has a program on his website that he
<br>
guarantees will add 20 to 40 IQ points in six weeks.
<br>
You do just two things. One is Image Streaming (go to
<br>
winwenger.com to see how that works). The other is
<br>
underwater swimming for an hour or so a day, holding
<br>
your breath as long as possible. It seems that this
<br>
triggers the diving reflex, and your carotid arteries
<br>
get a lot bigger, letting your brain get more blood.
<br>
It's like putting a turbocharger on your car. He got
<br>
this trick from an inventor known as &quot;Japan's Thomas
<br>
Edison&quot; who would go in his pool and 'hold breath till
<br>
almost die', then record his insights on a piece of
<br>
plexiglass with a waterproof marker.
