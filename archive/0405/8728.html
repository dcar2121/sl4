<p>Sorry, folks. I would lay any amount of money on the
<br>
proposition that wisdom is not going to be enhanced by
<br>
any sort of genetic engineering. One might improve
<br>
neural efficiency, memory storage, etc. but ***that's
<br>
not wisdom.*** We're pretty wisdom-optimized already,
<br>
genetically, except for those unfortunates who inherit
<br>
clearly damaging extra chromosomes, for instance.
<br>
Wisdom is a collection of good algorithms. Wise people
<br>
have and use them. Fools do not. I'll give you one
<br>
example.
<br>
I once shared a piece of info with a female friend,
<br>
and mentioned that it came from Esqire magazine. She
<br>
said &quot;I don't read men's magazines.&quot; I replied with
<br>
one of my most cherished algorithms:
<br>
***Never*** limit your sources of information.
<br>
This algorithm is important because you simply do not
<br>
know where you are going to find some learning that
<br>
you do not yet know you need. I'll read Cosmo if
<br>
there's a copy about.
<br>
I can scarcely impress upon you the damage that is
<br>
done by limiting sources of information. Idiot
<br>
dittohead Rush Limbaugh fans who only expose
<br>
themselves to other far-right propaganda sources such
<br>
as Fox news, the Washington Times, Insight, or
<br>
Newsmax.com are no better than fundamentalist-Islamic
<br>
extremists who limit themselves to whatever is
<br>
approved reading in their madrasas, or old-school
<br>
Catholics who obey the lists of banned books and
<br>
films, doctrinaire Communists with their Little Red
<br>
Books, or batty old cat-wrangling biddies who only
<br>
read the supermarket tabloids. In each case the person
<br>
in question gradually accretes a body of beliefs that
<br>
do not reflect reality and are never corrected. By
<br>
limiting their sources to a subset which (though false
<br>
or distorted) is internally consistent, they are able
<br>
to spend whole lifetimes avoiding wisdom.
<br>
Civilization is under dire threat from all these
<br>
people who limit their sources of information, but
<br>
still insist on telling the rest of us how to live.
<br>
Here's what I consider a classic chestnut in the
<br>
annals of smart-ain't-wise.
<br>
Former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu was a cabinet
<br>
officer in the first Bush administration (until he
<br>
resigned over improper use of official
<br>
transportation). He is said to have a Mensa I.Q.
<br>
Everyone says he's Smart. While in the Cabinet (circa
<br>
1990) he ran a climate simulation on his home computer
<br>
and decided that, according to the sim's results,
<br>
global warming was not a problem. Now, climatologists
<br>
running detailed global-warming simulations on Cray
<br>
supercomputers knew that their projections might not
<br>
be trustworthy, but this man, probably running a 386
<br>
at best, took his primitive, non-expert result as
<br>
gospel. Even I know better than that. Sununu's brain
<br>
might be fast, but he runs bad algorithms. Smart ain't
<br>
Wise.
<br>
I imagine one could compile a fairly manageable list
<br>
of algorithms which are found in all highly
<br>
intelligent and ethical people. What is Bayesian
<br>
thinking, except an algorithm that says 'keep
<br>
refreshing your data'?
<br>
By the way, another great algorithm, from H.P.
<br>
Lovecraft, and so appropriate to this discussion
<br>
group, is &quot;Never call up that which you cannot put
<br>
down.&quot; How many of sl4's posts are variations of this
<br>
idea.
