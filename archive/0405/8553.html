Hi Bill,  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think we've discussed this issue before. 
</em><br>
<p>We have. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Using the happiness of all humans as AI values equate AI values with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human values. This creates a symbiotic system that will value non-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentients because humans do. But by mediating this care through human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values, there should be no danger to humans caused by conflicts between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human interests and the interests of other sentients. 
</em><br>
<p>I can see this human centred system working in a few ways - one literal 
<br>
and several non-literal.
<br>
<p>The literal mechanism would require that any AIs that left the Earth 
<br>
would have to keep checking back with the real human population 
<br>
about new situations that it faces in various parts of the universe.  I 
<br>
think this would get increasingly unworkable as time goes on.
<br>
<p>Or the AI would have to simulate humans and take a copy of 'all' 
<br>
humans with them as they range the universe and get the simulation to 
<br>
do a 'take' on what is the right ethical stance for all new situations.  This 
<br>
seems like a pretty impractical thing to do.
<br>
<p>Or the AIs might try to synethesise a values algorithm that 
<br>
approximates the values of all humans at some date or other.  That's 
<br>
pretty tricky too.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that it might just be easier (and more effective) to try to 
<br>
figure out a values set more consciously.
<br>
<p>Anyway I guess my final feeling thoght is that your method could work 
<br>
while AIs and humans are confined to the Earth but it is likely to break 
<br>
down once this is not the case - especially if the AIs proliferate through 
<br>
the universe.  How would you see you method working in such a 
<br>
'geographically' non-constrained situation?
<br>
<p>Maybe humans and advanced AIs could work together on a conscious 
<br>
prime values set prior to AIs getting the freedom of the universe?  In 
<br>
the meantime your idea could be used?
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
