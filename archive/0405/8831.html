<p>Ben is nowhere remotely near the person closest to me in terms of 
<br>
understanding.  People to whom I can try speaking about the technical side 
<br>
of Friendliness include Michael Wilson and James Rogers, both of whom have 
<br>
received their Bayesian enlightenment (what James Rogers calls &quot;becoming 
<br>
one who deeply understands algorithmic information theory&quot;).  Ben's a nice 
<br>
guy but he isn't on that list.  A relaxed outlook on life and existential 
<br>
risks is not close to me in terms of &quot;drive&quot;, either.
<br>
<p>If you want to know whether I've gone nuts, I would suggest privately 
<br>
asking James Rogers.  Michael Wilson and Michael Raimondi are both capable 
<br>
of making the judgment, but their judgment is already known to me, and so 
<br>
it is not a fair test.  (Michael Wilson thinks I'm evil and insane, but in 
<br>
a healthy, competent, benevolent way.)
<br>
<p>I do intend to resume the &quot;external reference semantics&quot; thread, subject 
<br>
appropriately changed to &quot;FAI: external reference semantics&quot;, if I can get 
<br>
the time.  Right now I'm in the middle of working on a final draft of a 
<br>
quick update to Friendliness called &quot;Collective Volition&quot;, and have at 
<br>
least three other things on my plate, so it may not happen.  I do see it as 
<br>
a legitimate challenge, so I wouldn't argue if you say that I lost serious 
<br>
points for not responding.  Happens, though.
