<p>Oh, I've read it and I know that it would be probably be unethical to

remake the experiment. That does _not_ invalidate the points I made

though.

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Possibly, but there is one heck of a lot of evidence that humans can be

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That is a noble goal and something very good and useful to understand. I
<br>
did not say that your theory cannot be true, it can. But if you truly want
<br>
to understand what happens in such circumstances you also need to look at
<br>
the incentive structures in such situations and all those cases in which
<br>
humans are _not_ vicious to captives (which also happens).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It also does not take into account the possibility that these things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;arise from the social ideas in our culture (combined with the incentive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;structure).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Possible of course.  Not very likely if the origin is in the stone age.
</em><br>
<p>Are the origins truly in the stone age? If they are, how can you be sure
<br>
they are not part of the memetic baggage rather than genetic? After all if
<br>
we consider stone age, people were at the time capable of learning things
<br>
and of transmitting what they learned to their children. Ideas are created
<br>
and spread a lot faster than genetic changes, so this would imply hugely
<br>
greater probability that any such behavioral model created in the stone
<br>
ages would be memetic rather than genetic.
<br>
<p>The possible genetic baggage should then come from some pre-human period
<br>
rather than from human stone age period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This of course does not mean that we should not be careful when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;creating an AI, be it uploaded person or a creation. It does not mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that we should not look into the incentive structures that we create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;for the super AI to come.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that other psychological modes, the ones involved in war,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppress rational thinking in people.  An irrational AI is not something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think about before bedtime.  :-)
</em><br>
<p>I'm not yet quite convinced that people are necessarily taken over by
<br>
irrational thinking modes in such situations. I was speaking of incentive
<br>
structures, and those apply to AI as well. Of course, how they affect the
<br>
behavior of an AI depends on what kind of decision making system the AI
<br>
uses, but they still do affect it. Or if they don't, the AI will not be
<br>
good at making things happen or at living its life according to its own
<br>
principles.
