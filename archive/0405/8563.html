<p>
Keith (and SL4),
<br>
<p>All this talk about 'best interest' drives me a little nuts... but I gues
<br>
that is okay because it promts me into thinking productively
<br>
<p>I recently discussed the Big Brother aspect of FAI with an intelligent
<br>
newbie, and the necessity of explaining alternatives and providing cogent
<br>
examples lead me to greater thought on the subject.  My earlier conclusions,
<br>
that volitional morality will be very important to our freedom and safety in
<br>
the future, have gained even more validity as a result of more detailed
<br>
thinking on the issue. Also this thread, and the discussion of FAIs
<br>
estimating 'best interest', has driven me to articulate in greater detail
<br>
why having FAIs adhere to volitional morality as closely as possible would
<br>
be a good idea.
<br>
<p>The problem with the idea of 'best interest' in relation to a volitional
<br>
being, is not in its estimation, but in the resulting actions that some
<br>
suggest would be needed/wanted/rational/necessary.  When someone opines that
<br>
I will not be allowed to do something because it is not in my 'best
<br>
interest' then claxons begin sounding in my head.  When someone elaborates
<br>
further and suggests that other's interests might outweigh my own in some
<br>
arbitrary decision, I hallucinate strobing red lights.  When another 'pipes
<br>
in' that the problem may not be solvable, all hell breaks loose upstairs,
<br>
and I imagine frightened sailors running through corridors and closing
<br>
bulkheads.
<br>
<p>It should go without saying that a superintelligent Friendly being is going
<br>
to know what is in our 'best interest' better than we do.  But so what?
<br>
That does not mean, and should not mean that we cede personal decisions to
<br>
the FAI.
<br>
<p>In so far as a person's decisions/actions are morally positive or morally
<br>
neutral  (see definition in previous post:
<br>
<a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8491.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8491.html</a>) ...
<br>
<p>The assessment of 'best interest' can be correctly used by an FAI to decide
<br>
action in regards to a individual volitional being, a person... that action
<br>
should not be to overpower the person &quot;for their own good&quot; as that would be
<br>
a morally negative act.  The action could instead be persuasive.
<br>
non-invasive and helpful - in a way only an FAI-like being could be.  But
<br>
the decision, the volition should remain with the person, not be usurped by
<br>
the FAI.
<br>
<p>When the assessment of 'best interest' is made for a group rather than an
<br>
individual, then that information can also be used to decide action in
<br>
regards to that group, or individuals within it.  But again, that action
<br>
should not be to overpower any one of the individuals, or the group as a
<br>
whole &quot;for their own good&quot;.  This would make manifest the feared idea of Big
<br>
Brother watching and controlling everything, a hugely morally negative
<br>
situation.  The morally positive action an FAI might take could again be
<br>
persuasive, non-invasive and helpful - advice, not force.  And again, each
<br>
individual would be and should be responsible for their own decisions and
<br>
actions.
<br>
<p>As to the problem not being solvable, that is hyperbole.  Humans have been
<br>
successfully solving the problem of conflicting wants &amp; needs for millennia.
<br>
Sure, sometimes primitive mental programming gets switched on and all hell
<br>
breaks loose (competition for mates, war, etc.) but most of the time people
<br>
trade, negotiate, make deals, treaties and agreements - they sometimes even
<br>
come up with win-win solutions (gasp!).  If mere humans can solve this
<br>
problem, and on occasion solve it well, then an FAI should not find it too
<br>
difficult to facilitate.
<br>
<p>As for there being a single, universal 'best interest' - that item just
<br>
doesn't exist.  Each volitional being decides for itself what is its 'best
<br>
interest', and that evaluation is in constant flux.  It is part-and-parcel
<br>
of being a conscious, intelligent being.
<br>
<p>In so far as a person's decisions/actions are morally negative... well, that
<br>
is a whole-nother post.
<br>
<p>Keith, when you wrote: &quot;...understanding these [Ev.Psyc.] matters might be
<br>
essential to providing the environment in which friendly AI can be
<br>
developed.&quot;
<br>
-- Sort of.  It is not the environment that will be improved, but the
<br>
accuracy of the FAI's human-cognition model.  It is very important that an
<br>
FAI understand the ways in which human think so that it can better model the
<br>
future, and better understand the human-generated data that will be
<br>
presented to it.  It is not enough for an FAI to determine that Johnny
<br>
behaves with an approximation to Bayesian rationality 82.6% of the time.
<br>
FAI needs to know what Johnny is mentally doing the other 17.4%, and why,
<br>
and in what situations his cognition is likely to switch between modes.
<br>
<p>Be well.
<br>
