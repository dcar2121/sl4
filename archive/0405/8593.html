<p>Sorry, the capabilities of humans beyond the relatively shallow end of 
<br>
the system design space to practice such a technique are clear.   No 
<br>
matter how much you chunk we are hindered by computational speed, 
<br>
conscious attention limitations, inability to use much of our brain 
<br>
computationally and our limitations keep us from grasping patterns 
<br>
beyond a certain complexity as may be necessary to build more powerful 
<br>
tools/programs to offload much of the work.  The humans in the loop 
<br>
severely limit what can be done.  Take the humans out of the loop and 
<br>
you quickly get into the need for strong AI or substantially augmenting 
<br>
the humans at least.   Even with AI complexity would still need to be 
<br>
reckoned with.   What we are attempting cannot be built as if we are in 
<br>
some Newtonian clockwork universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It would only take a few seconds to write a computer program to find a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; even number greater than 4 that is not the sum of two primes and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stop, but what will the machine do, will it ever stop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an example of the distinction between acceptable and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unacceptable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty. We don't know if the program will terminate, but we know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it won't suddenly start modelling the programmer or rewriting its own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or converting the world into grey goo.
</em><br>
<p>Anything I would want to see develop from these efforts  would model 
<br>
the programmer and exceed the limitations of the programmer.  That is 
<br>
rather the whole point.    It will also self-examine and recursively 
<br>
improve.  It will become vastly more capable than we are and much more 
<br>
aware.  Otherwise, what is the point?
