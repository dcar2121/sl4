<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delurking momentarily.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is nothing wrong with a functionalist view of 
<br>
qualia. My opinion is that 'qualia' as used by most philosophers end 
<br>
up being essentially those functional descriptions of consciousness 
<br>
and the processes of thought that are not obvious. Yes, there is a 
<br>
difference between a strict functional definition of an experience, 
<br>
that is simply acquiring the knowledge that comes with that 
<br>
experience, and the actual experience of doing so, but its by virtue 
<br>
of embedding that thought in a very complex brain/consciousness with 
<br>
many properties that are not obvious or explained easily. 
<br>
Nevertheless, such properties have a physical reality and can be 
<br>
physically explored, and neuroscience and psychology will reveal many 
<br>
of them to philosophers that deign to dirty their hands with actual 
<br>
data.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm aware of the philosophical challenges to this viewpoint 
<br>
(inverted qualia, etc) but in as much as they all rest on postulating 
<br>
a being that is exactly the same in every way we can measure, only 
<br>
different in some crucial manner that we can't, I don't think there 
<br>
is a lot of value there.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness is a property of a system, IMO. A particle can't 
<br>
have awareness any more than a particle can have, say, transitivity. 
<br>
Only more so.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards
