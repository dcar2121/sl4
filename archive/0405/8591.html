</em><br>
<p>What does logic or your feelings have to do with it?  We are fast 
<br>
developing the ability to reprogram ourselves.  We need not be bound by 
<br>
any supposed past evolutionary imperative that no longer serves what we 
<br>
choose to do next.  Reading EP and understanding it should not lead to 
<br>
believing we are not increasingly free to re-write that programming.  
<br>
It sometimes seems to me that even SL4 folks aren't fully cognizant of 
<br>
the degree of incredible pending freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<p><em>&gt; Now, with our memes shaped by a number generations of relative plenty,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you the human race will be forced to picking one or the other, either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by our own volition or that imposed by an AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It quite obviously comes down to no such thing unless we are foolish 
<br>
enough or simply too slow to grasp and exercise the potentials now 
<br>
before us.   Why waste valuable time attempting to choose between two 
<br>
obviously inferior positions in the space of all possibilities?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (My personal preference is the third way, leave for the far side of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the galaxy and let others figure out what to do.)
</em><br>
<p>This is also an overly limited and limiting choice in my opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt; Keith, when you wrote: &quot;...understanding these [Ev.Psyc.] matters 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; essential to providing the environment in which friendly AI can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; developed.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; -- Sort of.  It is not the environment that will be improved, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; accuracy of the FAI's human-cognition model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasn't clear as to what I meant.  AI research requires considerable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologic support.  An environment that because of massive resource 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars lacked computers and even food for the researchers would not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conducive to much progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Even without improving the human creatures and even without AI or MNT, 
<br>
there is no need for a resource war, especially in energy.   It is more 
<br>
likely we will wreck our economies (as we are doing a fine job of in 
<br>
the US) and act so belligerently as to bring on a war of most other 
<br>
countries against the US.   But it will not be over resources per se 
<br>
although that may be the most apparent &quot;explanation&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It is very important that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; FAI understand the ways in which human think so that it can better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; model the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; future, and better understand the human-generated data that will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; presented to it.  It is not enough for an FAI to determine that Johnny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; behaves with an approximation to Bayesian rationality 82.6% of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; FAI needs to know what Johnny is mentally doing the other 17.4%, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; why,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and in what situations his cognition is likely to switch between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; modes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The implicit assumption that humans will remain relatively static must 
<br>
also be overcome.
