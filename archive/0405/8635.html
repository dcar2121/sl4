</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But oblivion also lies along the way of assuming that we are 
<br>
bound too tightly by the  programming to explore what  we can change.  
<br>
As we gain ever greater abilities and the world becomes much too 
<br>
complex the old programming and limitations can lead to nothing but 
<br>
ruin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt;&gt; We need not be bound by any supposed past evolutionary imperative 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; free to re-write that programming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You really should read Minsky's society of mind on this topic.  Being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to change your deepest desires on a whim is not a power to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used lightly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I read it.
<br>
<p>I said nothing about changing anything &quot;on a whim&quot;.   We change because 
<br>
we must but we must exercise as much care as possible and as much 
<br>
wisdom as to what we change to.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; It sometimes seems to me that even SL4 folks aren't fully cognizant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the degree of incredible pending freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And after you have removed your basic drives just what are you going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with that &quot;freedom&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You don't simply remove.  You &quot;grow&quot; and &quot;transform&quot;.   Obviously you 
<br>
don't simply saw off the branch you are sitting upon.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, with our memes shaped by a number generations of relative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; plenty, we think that killing off the neighboring  tribe's males and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; taking their resources and women is double-plus-ungood.  But if it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; comes down to strong restrictions on breeding or an occasional bout 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; of slaughter and be slaughtered, which do you pick?  The simplest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; math will tell you the human race will be forced to picking one or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the other, either by our own volition or that imposed by an AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It quite obviously comes down to no such thing unless we are foolish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enough or simply too slow to grasp and exercise the potentials now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; before us.   Why waste valuable time attempting to choose between two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; obviously inferior positions in the space of all possibilities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; (My personal preference is the third way, leave for the far side of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the galaxy and let others figure out what to do.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is also an overly limited and limiting choice in my opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have specific ideas of what to do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Augment and transform the intelligences already present, 
<br>
ourselves, as quickly and wisely as possible.   We have altruistic 
<br>
tendencies and a capacity for empathy and some understanding of human 
<br>
beings to start with.   What we are now is obviously not going to do 
<br>
and probably will not do for even building a reasonably safe seed AI.   
<br>
But if it was sufficiently augmented then we might stand a chance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Even without improving the human creatures and even without AI or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; MNT, there is no need for a resource war, especially in energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly.  30 years ago I was working on solar power satellites, one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the few ways that will solve the energy crisis.  The problem is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;need for a resource war,&quot; but getting one like it or not.  As I put 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it recently, stone age psychological traits pulling on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I surely agree with that.  I am continually amazed by how much is 
<br>
tolerated and claimed as &quot;the right way&quot; that is obviously vile evil 
<br>
nonsense.    IQs need to be raised and perhaps more importantly we must 
<br>
find a way through a lot of psychological defenses and force growing 
<br>
past the more limited traits or at least safely channeling them.   
<br>
There may not be a lot of time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The implicit assumption that humans will remain relatively static 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; must also be overcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I put it on another thread:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It is a dire and depressing business to realize that genes optimized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the stone age to cope with periodic privation of hunter gatherers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now pulling strings attached to nukes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  So we need to get over it to the degree we can.
