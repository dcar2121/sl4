<p>
Been writing about a really dismal subject that has application to one way 
<br>
some people think is a route to AI.
<br>
<p>I have been looking at conditionally switched on human psychological traits 
<br>
and was working on the traits that are the origin of war.  But recently I 
<br>
was distracted into writing about the counterpart to capture bonding in 
<br>
response to the news about the Iraq prison abuse.
<br>
<p>Years ago, Zimbardo had to shut down his famous Stanford prison experiment 
<br>
early because those chosen as &quot;guards&quot; were getting too vicious to those 
<br>
being &quot;prisoners.&quot;  <a href="http://www.prisonexp.org/">http://www.prisonexp.org/</a>
<br>
<p>The experiment showed that people switch into abuse mode when they have 
<br>
captives present.  This doesn't make sense in the present world, but it 
<br>
very likely did in the world in which we evolved (and which shaped our 
<br>
psychological traits including the conditional ones).
<br>
<p>We know that humans respond to capture and abuse by socially reorienting 
<br>
and bonding--the Stockholm Syndrome.  The evolutionary argument as to where 
<br>
this trait came from is obvious.  (If you reoriented and bonded to the 
<br>
tribe that had captured you, you had a good chance of being an ancestor, 
<br>
otherwise, you were most likely killed.)
<br>
<p>It also makes sense that the trait to abuse captives would have also been 
<br>
selected.  The argument isn't as obvious as the survival link with 
<br>
capture-bonding.  But it figures that in a world where 10% of an average 
<br>
tribe's females were captured, those who had the genes for an &quot;instinct&quot; 
<br>
for the brutal behavior needed to capture and turn on the capture-bonding 
<br>
trait in the captives left more descendents than those without it.
<br>
<p>And, like the capture-bonding trait, over a long enough time the trait to 
<br>
induce capture-bonding (TTICB) would become nearly universal.  I.e., it 
<br>
would be triggered in response to the conditions needed to turn it 
<br>
on.  That's probably the evolutionary origin of the trait expressed by 
<br>
Zimbardo's &quot;guards&quot; The trait to be brutal gets automatically switched on 
<br>
by the mere presence of captives.
<br>
<p>These traits had overall positive effects (for genes) when our remote 
<br>
ancestors all lived as hunter-gatherers.  The abuse caused the captives to 
<br>
socially reorient to the captors and they were incorporated into the tribe 
<br>
that had captured them.  The closest modern behavior is frat hazing, 
<br>
limited duration abuse followed by incorporation into the &quot;tribe.&quot;
<br>
<p>But prisons (which of course didn't exist in the environment in which we 
<br>
evolved) stall the process of taking a captive into a tribe so the abuse 
<br>
phase goes on without letup.
<br>
<p>A dire and dismal business.  Unfortunately it has application to the 
<br>
friendly AI problem.
<br>
<p>One path to AI that has been proposed, &quot;if we can't do it any other way&quot; is 
<br>
uploading.
<br>
<p>If you upload human minds into very capable hardware, you want to be 
<br>
absolutely sure that you don't turn mechanisms such as this one or the ones 
<br>
that lead to wars.  And how many of these conditionally switched on 
<br>
dangerous psychological mechanisms do humans have left over from the 
<br>
Pleistocene?  And what environmental conditions turn them on?
<br>
<p>Darned if I know.
<br>
<p>John Tooby figured out capture-bonding about 1980 (but didn't publish for 
<br>
some reason).  I figured it out in 1996.  Took 8 years for it to dawn on me 
<br>
that the corresponding evolved trait to treat captives brutally (to turn on 
<br>
capture-bonding) accounted for Zimbardo's prison experiments.
<br>
<p>In retrospect these mechanisms are so obvious that it makes you wonder if 
<br>
we are not subject to a psychological blindness to conditionally switched 
<br>
on psychological mechanisms.  Thinking about them may make us feel we are 
<br>
less in control than we would like, but most people understand that there 
<br>
are environmental circumstances (such as a loved one being attacked) will 
<br>
make killers out of anyone.  It perhaps more disturbing to realize that 
<br>
there are simple environmental circumstances will make us vicious toward 
<br>
helpless captives.
<br>
<p>In any case, uploading looks far more dangerous than it did a week ago.
