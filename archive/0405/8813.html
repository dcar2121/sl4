<p>It's illegal now, and it oughta stay that way. The
<br>
big, big, big problem with bribery/coercion/blackmail
<br>
now is that the people in charge of catching and
<br>
prosecuting criminals of this sort are stymied when
<br>
the crimes are committed by people ABOVE THEM in
<br>
higher government positions, and various roadblocks
<br>
are put in the way of a prosecution. There's a lot of
<br>
real lawbreaking happening at the top which is going
<br>
unpunished because of 'bugs' in the governmental
<br>
software. It's getting worse, fast. I first began to
<br>
truly grok this phenomenon twenty years ago after I
<br>
read the dialogue in Godel, Escher, Bach wherein the
<br>
Tortoise kept bringing records designed to destroy
<br>
Achilles' hi-fi, and kept bringing new records
<br>
designed to go after the flaws in improved hi-fi's. I
<br>
began to understand it was the same principle that
<br>
kept predators and prey in a constant evolutionary
<br>
arms race, the same principle that we now see with
<br>
computer viruses and antivirus software.
<br>
<p>It's like the AIDS virus. If the immune system is
<br>
doing a good job, it is still possible to attack the
<br>
immune system itself. The United States has a
<br>
goverment whose immune system is almost fatally
<br>
compromised. A determined, ruthless and well-financed
<br>
coalition of enemies forced the last president into a
<br>
perjury trap (using a perjured plaintiff in a lawsuit)
<br>
and impeached him because they had the votes in
<br>
Congress necessary to bring impeachment. I remember
<br>
hearing conservatives brag that they would impeach
<br>
Clinton after they won control of the Congress in the
<br>
1994 elections, before he had even met Monica
<br>
Lewinsky! In other words, the votes were there, the
<br>
charge would be supplied later. I am not making this
<br>
up.
<br>
Now we have a president who is truly illegitimate
<br>
(gregpalast.com has the details) and rampantly
<br>
corrupt, surrounded by blatant crooks, etc., etc. yet
<br>
he cannot be charged or impeached because all the
<br>
mechanisms that are legally empowered to deal with his
<br>
crimes are controlled by forces friendly to him. If he
<br>
is reelected, the transition to a one-party state will
<br>
be complete. The democracy will exist in brand name
<br>
only.
<br>
<p>As an aside, the folks in Iraq are not retarded. They
<br>
see what this man has done to democracy in his
<br>
homeland. How can he claim to be exporting it to them?
<br>
It would be funny if it were happening to some other
<br>
planet.
<br>
<p>Now, I know I've gone off on a diatribe here, but it's
<br>
that important to me. I have seen this stuff coming
<br>
for years. The people on this list know how lonely it
<br>
can be to be surrounded by people who can't see the
<br>
tsunami. As Ben knows, I wrote a piece last year
<br>
outlining how a Singularity may be the only thing
<br>
standing between the human race and an unbreakable
<br>
Orwellian/theocratic tyranny.
<br>
And I do believe I have said all I am going to say on
<br>
this subject. It makes me ill.
<br>
