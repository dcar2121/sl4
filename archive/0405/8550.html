</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm doing neither. I'm using the term 'best interest' to designate that

<em>&gt; which is *best* for the person --'best' according to his/her own system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of values/utility function/conception of the good life/goal system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them what you wish).
</em><br>
<p>What you are describing is merely what is consistent with the 
<br>
understanding of the person at the time regarding their values.  Most 
<br>
people are notoriously poor at such understanding and have highly 
<br>
rationalized irrational value systems.   So how would such consistency 
<br>
be at all helpful beyond simply letting the individual make her own 
<br>
choices?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In order to determine a person's best interest, you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have to weigh their options against their goal system (not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yours!) and choose the best option which is consistent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that goal system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course. That's exactly my point. Only that the weighing involves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present and future preferences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You have no means of determining future preferences.  Or are you 
<br>
speaking of preferences regarding future state?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Unless you are intelligent enough to closely simulate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; person, however (and no human currently is), you are unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to be able to make such a determination, so you must accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the person's own decisions as the closest approximation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their &quot;best interest&quot; that you can find.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not opposing a person's decisions with the decisions of an external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer. I'm opposing the person's present decisions with her own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future ones. When you talk about accepting the person's own decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you seem to ignore that those decisions involve a whole *range* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preferences -- a temporal range which projects into the future.
</em><br>
<p>There are many ways that humans generally do no act to secure their 
<br>
wishes projected into the future.  There are acts in conflict, acts of 
<br>
commission and omission and so on.  Do you actually propose to compel 
<br>
individuals to act more consistently with their stated values?   If you 
<br>
are not advocating some kind of compulsion then I am not sure what it 
<br>
is you do intend in this discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision the person takes in the present contradicts the decision the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person will take in the future, you are not &quot;accepting&quot; the person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision when you accept her present one. On the contrary, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrarily giving absolute importance to a single point in the segment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that represents the temporal dimension of the person's interests (= 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system/etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There it is again, &quot;the decision the person will take in the future&quot;.   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No one can know this yet to be decided decision!   This is 
<br>
nonsensical.
