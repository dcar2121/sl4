<p><em>&gt;&gt;The main objection to this prediction, raised by Hanson (with whom I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;agree), is that the rise of uploads legally capable of exercising 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ownership rights *and* psychological self-modification may result in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;situation where the vast majority of legally enfranchised sentients 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;evolved to put maximum value on self-replication, rather than personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;income growth. **In that case indeed the average per human income might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;reduced - but this would be irrelevant to the issue of political 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;stability, as humans would be a insignificant minority, incapable of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;disrupting the society.**
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Rafal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But would we want that type of political stability? Cybernetic feudalism, 
</em><br>
<p>in which the remnant of non-uploaded humanity lived   on the sufferance of
<br>
<p>their uploaded overlords, is precisely the scary scenario that the 
<br>
opponents
<br>
<p>of the transhumanist progress we want are continually throwing in our 
<br>
faces.
<br>
<p>Please note that I do not find any fault in your analysis, but only in the
<br>
<p>desirability of its results. And I don't believe that these particular 
<br>
results
<br>
<p>are inevitable (and hope you agree). Our task, as I see it, is to ensure 
<br>
that
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;the human family (broadly defined, including all posthumans) allows
<br>
<p>diversification and even some degree of social stratification (which is
<br>
<p>inevitable in any case) but without regressing into the ancient social 
<br>
forms
<br>
<p>in which the lower social strata were practically enslaved by the upper 
<br>
ones.
<br>
<p>### I would not use the analogy to feudalism here - after all, we 
<br>
postulate that the average sentient would evolve to have minimal 
<br>
personal needs, rather than the expansive and expensive tastes of 
<br>
aristocrats. It is the unmodified humans, with their appetites for 
<br>
consumption, beauty, power, etc. etc., who might be likened to the 
<br>
king's courtiers who wander around aimlessly after the revolution, 
<br>
bereft of their accustomed grandeur, while the bee-like masses around 
<br>
them busy themselves with deeds incomprehensible.
<br>
<p>I agree with you that these results are not desirable (at least for 
<br>
those who insist on being human), and are not inevitable. But, again, 
<br>
perhaps because of my inveterate optimism, I would think that 
<br>
enslavement of humans by posthumans is unlikely - exasperated 
<br>
abandonment is my current favorite expectation.
