Your analogy makes sense in terms of visualizing relative levels of 
<br>
knowledge, encapsulating previous understanding, of a topic.
<br>
<p>Your analogy breaks down when you apply it directly to the *process* of 
<br>
understanding.
<br>
<p>The process of understanding, as you said, moves from the specific to 
<br>
the more abstract, &quot;chunking&quot; the discrete observations in a more 
<br>
compact representational form linked to related concepts. Later, one can 
<br>
subjectively visualize one's knowledge base in terms of an image of 
<br>
increasing resolution, or as a tree with increasing branches, or as a 
<br>
tapestry of increasing threads, etc.
<br>
<p>The danger of the analogy, and what has caused countless people to spend 
<br>
a good portion of their lives naval-gazing, is when they experience a 
<br>
&quot;Wow!&quot; sensation, correlate that sensation with true value, and embark 
<br>
on a quest for knowledge to be *revealed* to them if they only look 
<br>
deeply enough.
