<p><p>The digression into quantum logic and related bits set off some red 
<br>
flags in my mind, and after going back and reading some of the 
<br>
literature, it *really* started to set off some flags.  The 
<br>
mathematical models seem vaguely consistent in isolation, but they do 
<br>
not appear to be completely consistent as a body nor with the evidence 
<br>
available for practical matters.  This isn't a direct criticism of the 
<br>
above quoted material or what anyone wrote per se, but something 
<br>
doesn't hold up.  There is some type of mismatched assumptions in the 
<br>
interaction of all the pieces.  It looks like a variant of a mistake 
<br>
I've actually seen before in literature.
<br>
<p>1.)  QM models generally assert non-determinism inappropriately.  They 
<br>
assume literal mathematical non-determinism, but generally make no 
<br>
distinction for systems that are not measurably deterministic but which 
<br>
are nonetheless fundamentally deterministic.  Expressions of both cases 
<br>
will look empirically identical but the mathematical consequences of 
<br>
which model you assume are qualitatively different.  There is no 
<br>
justification for assuming non-determinism over non-measurable 
<br>
determinism in practice.
<br>
<p>2.)  The physics do not seem to imply mathematical non-determinism, 
<br>
just a system which is not measurably deterministic.  Hell, the 
<br>
mathematics of QM in question have finite descriptions, which means 
<br>
&quot;deterministic&quot; in a normal Kolmogorov sense (it is worth noting that a 
<br>
number of other people have raised this particular objection in 
<br>
literature).
<br>
<p><p>The basic problem that I see is that no distinction is made in the math 
<br>
between non-deterministic systems and systems which are not measurably 
<br>
deterministic in some finite context.  And that an assumption of 
<br>
non-determinism is used for some of the physics appears incorrect prima 
<br>
facie from an information theoretic standpoint.  One could throw in a 
<br>
bunch of stuff about Fisher information etc, but i think the real 
<br>
problem lies in the assumption I already mentioned.  So from this 
<br>
standpoint, the standard deterministic model would still seem to apply.
<br>
<p>I've noticed that very few papers actually deal with the measurability 
<br>
of determinism in their models, which is closely related to predictive 
<br>
limits (how I became acquainted with the concept a number of years 
<br>
ago).  It is nonetheless a very important concept to keep straight when 
<br>
talking about computation on finite state machinery because the 
<br>
consequences are broad and subtle.
<br>
<p><p>So in short, I'm not buying the non-deterministic quantum escape hatch 
<br>
unless someone can make a convincing argument that we are not looking 
<br>
at a non-measurable deterministic (there has got to be a better term 
<br>
for this -- it doesn't have a namespace in math AFAIK) phenomenon, 
<br>
because there is not insignificant evidence that the latter is the 
<br>
actual case.  I call it an &quot;escape hatch&quot; because using an assumption 
<br>
of non-determinism automagically solves nasty problems without much 
<br>
additional thought.  In other words, it is probably popular because it 
<br>
is theoretically convenient and most folks are not terribly familiar 
<br>
with predictive limits/measurability of determinism math.
<br>
<p><p>This is probably a bad time to be dropping a hairy theory grenade since 
<br>
I'll be traveling for a few days, but there it is.  I'm calling 
<br>
shenanigans.  I'll add that fine models for consciousness, qualia, etc 
<br>
can be elegantly derived from the deterministic system, even if it 
<br>
doesn't allow you to conveniently bury the subtleties in 
<br>
non-determinism.
