Hi Eliezer,  
<br>
<p>You clearly think it's better to have just one FAI project to worry about. 
<br>
But isn't this just engaging in fantasy thinking because there *isn't* just 
<br>
one AGI project. What's the point in trying to theorise or act practically 
<br>
in a situation that doesn't exist and cannot exisit unless somebody 
<br>
successfully persuades all but one AGI projects to close down.  
<br>
Knowing the huge personal and in some cases organisational 
<br>
comitment behind the current multiple AGI projects I can't see their 
<br>
number being reduced to one unless this is done by successful 
<br>
forceable coercion.  My understanding is that this latter action is not 
<br>
something that you or the Singularity Institute are advocating or 
<br>
intending to do.
<br>
<p>Successful coercion could come from conventional human forces - but 
<br>
most likely only in the context of *global* dictatorship or *gobal* anti-
<br>
AGI panic - or from the first super AGI destroying all other AGI projects.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that there will be many AGI projects - at least for some 
<br>
time.  If there is any prospect that an UNfriendly AGI could get close to 
<br>
take off then it seems to me that all other AGI projects will need to 
<br>
cooperate to ensure that they are not eliminated and that the UN 
<br>
friendly AGI is change or made ineffective.
<br>
<p>If the first AGI project is Friendly, then it might be able to help 
<br>
subsequent projects to be friendly too - most likely a better course of 
<br>
action than setting out to destroy all other AGI projects.
<br>
<p>So it seems to me that theorising should start with reality - that there 
<br>
will be many AGI projects for some time and that a drastic reduction in 
<br>
the number of projects and indeed the number of instantiations is only 
<br>
likely to occur in very negative circumstances.
<br>
<p>In this context I think it's worth theorising and then acting on the notion 
<br>
of ensuring *slow* take-off - this avoids anyone having to go into panic 
<br>
mode and allows a lot more learning from experience.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
