<p>
Jef,  
<br>
<p>What you said in your last message makes such a huge amount of 
<br>
sense. Thanks.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip

<p><p><em>&gt; Those who attend to transhumanist discussion lists are conversant with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas of radical morphological change, super-intelligences, and the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum of possible worlds explored almost exclusively within the Sci-Fi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature and discussion groups such as this one.  We tend to be young,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smart, and therefore arrogant to an extent that is appreciated only with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing life experience.  Although we can't know what we don't know, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are smart enough to recognize this heuristic and use it to temper some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our speculation in the domain of the near-term here and now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I think is under-represented in these groups is an effective level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness and appreciation of human nature on the broader scale.  Humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are diverse, creative, and driven to improve their conditions. Humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within their cultural matrix, comprise the most intelligent system we know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of.  This intelligent system even has built-in human values at its core!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, this intelligent system today suffers from a scaling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem; the processes that worked well enough at the level of the tribe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and village are not effective at the world global scale and humans are at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk of failing due to a lack of global scale &quot;management&quot; (perception,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control and feedback) of their vital processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fortunately, the necessary tools are becoming available at the time when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are most needed.  Global communications and knowledge sharing are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing rapidly while the economy is evolving to become completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global -- the system is evolving beyond the human scale and humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking on the role of functional components.  And yes, along with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ongoing process of growth and adaptation comes some measure of pain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visible in terms of human suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point here is that we humans are truly and effectively part of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; larger system, and it is to our benefit to see this clearly and use this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge to guide our choices.  Working with the larger system means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking actions that make the system function more effectively.  What is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualitatively different about this stage of evolutionary development is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the cells of the organism can now predict and plan, not just respond,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the needs of the larger organism of which they are a part and on which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they depend for their survival and well-being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A systems design engineering approach can be effective here and requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge of the materials and operating environment (currently humans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their ecosystem and culture) and also requires implementation of effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensing, control, and feedback processes as mentioned earlier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At this stage, to minimize pain and suffering as humanity moves to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next plateau, we don't need (yet) radical intelligence optimization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans or AIs.   What we need is the systems-level improvements that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow us to get to the next level. *Further globalization of the economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is key to creating an interdependent planetary civilization where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large-scale destruction of &quot;the Other&quot; will become meaningless. *Global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication, knowledge sharing, and adoption of new concepts of privacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and transparency will match and help us handle the threat of terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts, and lay the groundwork for the next generation of humanity to grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up with a global perspective. *Global thinking will progress to the kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of larger-scope rationality that makes the prisoner's dilemma and most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero-sum game problems trivial. *Intelligence augmentation will progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond our currently primitive mind-amplification tools and provide us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the necessary capability for information management and collaborative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision making during the next stage, and help us create the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recently on this list, human examples of enlightened altruism were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presented.  Sidhartha Gautama, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (perhaps the Dalai Lama should be also included here -- all are unenhanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, biologically similar to the rest of humanity, serving as models of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is already within our reach, given the necessary and conducive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIAI and similar efforts play a valuable role in promoting discussion and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising awareness of our accelerating times.  AI will play a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; role in our future, but many on this list may be surprised what will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done without requiring machine sentience and recursive self modification. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe these too will come, but we have to survive the global maturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humanity before then.
</em><br>
