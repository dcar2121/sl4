<p><p>I'm not sure why you have suddenly started claiming
<br>
that human self-modification is very problematical.
<br>
<p>I do agree that it would be exceedingly complex and
<br>
dangerous to try to actually eliminate the *capacity*
<br>
for experiencing specific qualia.  But as far as I can
<br>
make out, all of the problems people have with
<br>
specific qualia come about not because of the *qualia*
<br>
per se, but the *reaction* to it.  Addiction,
<br>
distraction, obsession, frustration etc these are all
<br>
a consequence of the *desire* for qualia.  For
<br>
instance a person may be addicted to chocolate.  But
<br>
the problem is not the ability to taste chocolate per
<br>
se, but the *desire* to taste it.  So we don't need to
<br>
eliminate the *capacity* for qualia to fix the
<br>
problem.  We just need to adjust the *desire* factor.
<br>
<p>And there are reasons for believing that adjusting
<br>
*desire* is actually quite simple.  There is a known
<br>
medical condition where a person has full sensory
<br>
experience, but they don't care about it in the
<br>
slightest.  For instance when a person with this
<br>
condition is given pain, they are *aware* of the pain,
<br>
but it doesn't perturb them.  So it seems that
<br>
attraction and repulsion to specific qualia is totally
<br>
independent of the *capacity* for the qualia.  Other
<br>
evidence:  Drugs that eliminate addiction.  Hormones
<br>
that easily turn up and down a person’s sex drive etc.
<br>
<p>I see no reason why we need try to eliminate the
<br>
*capacity* for specific qualia.  If we don't like
<br>
certain qualia, all we have to do to turn down our
<br>
*desire* for it, and it should no longer bother us. 
<br>
Sure, that will lead to some inefficiency if the
<br>
qualia is no longer useful to us when we become
<br>
post-human, but it shouldn't be a problem.  It just
<br>
means that the software encompassing our mind will
<br>
have to be treated as a legacy system.
<br>
<p>And although there is reason for thinking that trying
<br>
to eliminate the capacity for specific qualia would be
<br>
exceedingly complex and dangerous, the converse is not
<br>
true.  There is no reason for thinking that ADDING the
<br>
capacity for new kinds of qualia would be
<br>
problematical.  Since the mind has the capacity for
<br>
learning, it should be able to adjust to any new kinds
<br>
of capacity quite easily.
