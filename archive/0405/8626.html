<p>Completely reflective, and not self-aware in the sense of that which we 
<br>
refer to as &quot;conscious experience&quot;.  (Remember, this may look like a 
<br>
mysterious question, but there is no such thing as a mysterious answer.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I understand you correctly I am not at all sure I can support such

</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understand the danger here.  But Samantha, I'm not sure I'm ready 
<br>
to be a father.  I think I know how to redirect futures, deploy huge 
<br>
amounts of what I would consider to be intelligence and what I would 
<br>
cautiously call &quot;optimization pressures&quot; for the sake of avoiding 
<br>
conversational ambiguity.  But I'm still fathoming the reasons why 
<br>
humans think they have conscious experiences, and the foundations of 
<br>
fun, and the answers to the moral questions implicit in myself.  I feel 
<br>
myself lacking in the knowledge, and the surety of knowledge, needed to 
<br>
create a new sentient species.  And I wistfully wish that all humankind 
<br>
should have a voice in such a decision, the creation of humanity's first 
<br>
child.  And I wonder if it is a thing we would regard as a loss of 
<br>
destiny, to be rescued from our present crisis by a true sentient mind 
<br>
vastly superior to ourselves in both intelligence and morality, rather 
<br>
than a powerful optimization process bound to the collective volition of 
<br>
humankind.  There's a difference between being manifesting the 
<br>
superposed extrapolation of the decisions humankind would prefer given 
<br>
sufficient intelligence, and being rescued by an actual parent.
<br>
<p>If I can, Samantha, I would resolve this present crisis without creating 
<br>
a child, and leave that to the future.  I fear making a mistake that 
<br>
would be terrible even if remediable, and I fear exercising too much 
<br>
personal control over humankind's destiny.  Perhaps it is not possible 
<br>
even in principle, to build a nonsentient process that can extrapolate 
<br>
the volitions of sentient beings without ever actually simulating 
<br>
sentient beings to such a degree that we would see helpless minds 
<br>
trapped inside a computer.  It is more difficult, when one considers 
<br>
that constraint.  One cannot brute-force the problem with a training set 
<br>
and a hypothesis search, for one must understand enough about sentience 
<br>
to rule out &quot;hypotheses&quot; that are actual sentient beings.  The added 
<br>
constraint forces me to understand the problem on a deeper level, and 
<br>
work out the exact nature of things that are difficult to understand. 
<br>
That is a good thing, broadly speaking.  I find that much of life as a 
<br>
Friendly AI programmer consists in forcing your mind to get to grips 
<br>
with difficult problems, instead of finding excuses not to confront them.
<br>
<p>I am going to at least try to pursue the difficult questions and do this 
<br>
in the way that I see as the best possible, and if I find it is too 
<br>
difficult *then* I will go back to my original plan of becoming a 
<br>
father.  But I have learned to fear any clever strategy for cheating a 
<br>
spectacularly difficult question.  Do not tell me that my standards are 
<br>
too high, or that the clock is ticking; past experience says that 
<br>
cheating is extremely dangerous, and I should try HARD before giving up.
