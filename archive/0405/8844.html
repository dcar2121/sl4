<em>&gt;It's a little embarrassing to admit this but I'm handicapped. When I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3 years old I fell off my tricycle and hit my head, I wasn't badly hurt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physically but it rendered me permanently non-sentient. I think I've done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a good job overcoming my disability, I do pretty well on IQ tests if I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say so myself, I earn a good living, I have friends, I laugh and cry just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like anybody else, in fact I've done such a good job overcoming my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;handicap that nobody has ever guesses that I'm no more conscious than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rock. When I was younger I assumed I was the only human in this condition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but now that I come to think (thinking has nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness remember, I’ve hears members of this list say so) about it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if somebody else was as good at this charade as I am there would be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way I could tell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps there are even people who are non-sentient but don't know it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they think they know what consciousness is, but really it's like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difference between a firefly and a supernova, they have no hint of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immense and glorious feeling of sentience that most other people have but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they do not. This is all speculation of course; I wouldn't know anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about it, as I said I'm smart as a whip but no more conscious than sack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;full of door knobs. I envy you conscious beings. I think.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, either sentience can be defined in a 
<br>
testable manner. If a being has internal mental 
<br>
states, and can both recognising them and 
<br>
abstractly reason about its own mental states (a 
<br>
precondition which implies some degree of 
<br>
intelligence and linguistic capability), then I'd 
<br>
argue that that (and a few other, easier to 
<br>
satisfy, preconditions) makes it sentient. Or at 
<br>
least, thats a good enough working definition for 
<br>
now, and we can refine our definition as it comes 
<br>
closer to reality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, its perfectly possible to make up a 
<br>
thought experiment where there exists a being 
<br>
that is intelligent and capable of perfectly 
<br>
mimicking consciousness, but is not 
<br>
consciousness. But its perfectly possible to make 
<br>
up thought experiments with inherent logical 
<br>
fallacies of all kinds, and I'm yet to be 
<br>
convinced that this isn't a subtle form of such. 
<br>
Once definitions of consciousness are pinned 
<br>
down, each will shown to either be actually 
<br>
testable (if perhaps in many cases impractical to 
<br>
actually test against a worst case scenario of 
<br>
deliberate falsification) or philosophically 
<br>
untenable.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the possible construction of 
<br>
systems that can effectively simulate a conscious 
<br>
being in a restricted range of procedures (ie the 
<br>
Turing test, Chinese rooms, and their ilk) 
<br>
doesn't prove anything about the existence or 
<br>
importance of consciousness, any more than the 
<br>
existence of synthesisers and audio reproduction 
<br>
techniques says much significant about the 
<br>
existence or usefulness of analog music 
<br>
instruments. In fact it says pretty much the same 
<br>
thing - which is to say, nothing about the 
<br>
existence whatsoever, and potentially enabling 
<br>
simple facsimiles to substitute for reality in a 
<br>
number of simplistic scenarios (which is 
<br>
nonetheless useful).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers
<br>
