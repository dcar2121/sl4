<em>&gt; &gt; You will always have non-integrated parts (also known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as individuals) [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will have non-integrated parts *if* that is how you build the mind.
</em><br>
<p>At some size point, you will either have unintegrated parts or you will have
<br>
let a lot of information go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Also, it is entirely incorrect to dismiss a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because the reasoning process that arrived at it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How then do you propose to judge conclusions, or answers, that have not
</em><br>
yet
<br>
<em>&gt; been verified against reality but that on which we need to rely?
</em><br>
<p>C'mon.  You remove the evidence for a conclusion when the evidence is proved
<br>
to be incorrect.  You do NOT automatically mark the conclusion as false
<br>
unless the remaining evidence deems it as such.  And if there is
<br>
insufficient remaining evidence, you don't rely on the conclusion and you DO
<br>
escalate the importance of finding evidence regarding the conclusion.  What
<br>
other answer did you expect?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's one hour before the destruction of the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have twenty doors - nineteen take 50 minutes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; traverse and come back, one leads to the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; invulnerability of human beings in 25 minutes.  Do I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want one runner or twenty?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An FAI simply forks twenty processes to do the job.  FAI != human.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, the total computational power available to the FAI was required
<br>
to successfully navigate the path behind each door in the time indicated.
<br>
Your FAI did successfully navigate the first 12% of the path to human
<br>
invulnerability but the human race died because you assumed an omnipotent
<br>
FAI.  Maybe if you'd had a team of twenty FAIs (which takes less hardware
<br>
than an AI of size 20)?  FAI != omnipotent
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You lost me at &quot;one AI cares only about paperclips,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; while the other cares only about staples&quot;.  They both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; care about friendliness. [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep, you missed the argument.  The AIs being describe were unfriendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Re-read it again without *any* assumptions other than that the AIs have
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; goals as given: paperclips or staples.
</em><br>
<p>No, I deliberately stopped because the argument started with a nonsensical
<br>
premise.  Re-read my argument that starts with the correct premise for the
<br>
situations that we're discussing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AI theory is not like Physics equations.  You can't write it down on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single sheet of letterhead.  A good example might be Ben's own Novamente
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documentation - it is huge!  Are you expecting FAI documentation to be any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shorter?
</em><br>
<p>Ben's Novamente documentation is huge but digestible given sufficient time.
<br>
You can prove things with it and argue against parts of it. Ben's
<br>
documentation allows others to work on his problem and correct his errors
<br>
(or, at least, debate them)
<br>
<p>I would expect the FAI documentation to also be of substantial size.
<br>
Unfortunately, FAI documentation is either mostly non-existent or such a
<br>
closely held secret that very few people have seen it.
<br>
<p>Which style of documentation better facilitates collaboration and offers a
<br>
better chance of a speedy success?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is knowably more difficult to design a set of independent social beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that tend as a group to constrain their growth and development along a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly trajectory, than to design a singleton to do the same.
</em><br>
<p>Could you offer some proof of this or arguments that tend to support this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is knowably more risk in failing to get a 6 when rolling a dice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple times, instead of one time - even when the dice is loaded.
</em><br>
<p>But that's the wrong argument.  I counter with the fact that it is much less
<br>
likely to get a majority of sixes when rolling multiple dice than it is to
<br>
get a single six.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Redundancy is a good thing in certain situations.  It would be very often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true that a group of three humans could address a challenging problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together much more effectly than a single person, even if they each all
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; a Pocket Armagedon (TM), unless one (or more) of them was an intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychopath.
</em><br>
<p>You don't give them all a Pocket Armageddon.  You give them one Pocket
<br>
Armageddon with three keys.  At the least, then, the intelligent psychopath
<br>
has to murder the other two without accidentally disabling their keys AND
<br>
then set off armageddon before being caught (possibly by more AIs).
