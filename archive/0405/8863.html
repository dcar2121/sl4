<em>&gt; OK.  Try this scenario . . . . An FAI believes that it

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It implements it.  Circumstances subsequently change in

<em>&gt; a REALLY unexpected manner.  Oops!  Under these very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odd new circumstances, the &quot;enhancement&quot; turns out to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be catastrophic for the human race . . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But wait!  There are three other FAIs that are in close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication with this FAI.  Friendliness dictates that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they should work in close co-operation in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent errors of this type.  The other FAIs have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made this particular &quot;enhancement&quot; and correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluate the situation for what it is.  They outvote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the FAI with the &quot;enhancement&quot; and the &quot;enhanced&quot; FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (who is still mostly Friendly and merely mistaken)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rolls the &quot;enhancement&quot; back (or modifies it) so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human race lives for the next moment or so . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>One can always imagine a way that something will break.  This is important
<br>
to acknowledge the possibility, and address it.  Whether there is one
<br>
collection of processes you point to and call it a single FAI, or call it
<br>
multiple FAIs, it will be possible that it will break.  The plan AFAIK is to
<br>
reduce this possibility to near zero.
<br>
<p>It does not follow that a catastrophe that will break one AI will be less
<br>
likely to break multiple AIs.  That would be anthropomorphic thinking.  For
<br>
human beings it is demonstrably true that groups have greater abilities to
<br>
address unexpected situations.  It is true because:
<br>
&nbsp;a) several humans have more data than one,
<br>
&nbsp;b) several humans have more MIPS than one,
<br>
&nbsp;c) humans are optimized by evolution to work in groups as well as
<br>
independently
<br>
&nbsp;d) several humans have greater physical work capacity than one.
<br>
None of these points *has* to be true of AI.  AI is not like humans in these
<br>
ways.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good engineering often dictates redundancy.  Common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense (which ain't so common - yes, I know) strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promotes checks and balances.  Human history shows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that when diversity of opinion is allowed to flourish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that good things happen and that when diversity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppressed that BAD things happen.  You seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flying in the face of a lot of good consensus about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety measures without a reason except &quot;I am at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loss to understand what is gained . . . .&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The concepts 'redundancy' and 'diversity of opinion' are different concepts.
<br>
It can be confusing to co-present them as two sides of the same coin.
<br>
Redundancy in engineering often reduces risk of failure, and where this
<br>
applies, I am sure it will be used in the creation of FAI.  Diversity of
<br>
opinion in human society is seen as a good thing in the West.  The metaphor
<br>
does not translate well to the operation of FAI.  The &quot;good consensus about
<br>
safety measures&quot; applies to humans.  We are not building a human.  That does
<br>
not automatically rule out the safety considerations that work with humans.
<br>
Diversity can be contained/generated from within a single object named FAI
<br>
just as from mutually independent objects - and probably with less work.
<br>
There are often many ways of looking at a given problem, and different
<br>
viewpoints reveal/hide different aspects of that problem.  Your argument
<br>
seems to imply that a single object named FAI would be unable to analyze
<br>
problems in multiple ways - meaning: as if being looked at by multiple
<br>
humans.  I would say that is a false implication.
<br>
<p>You have a valid point, one that has been noted and addressed for some time.
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
