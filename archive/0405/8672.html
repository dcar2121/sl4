<p>Ben?  Put yourself in my shoes for a moment and ask yourself the question: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do I prove to a medieval alchemist that there is no way to concoct 
<br>
an immortality serum by mixing random chemicals together?&quot;  Bear in mind 
<br>
that if the medieval alchemist swallows something lethal, you die and so 
<br>
does the rest of the human species.  Bear in mind also that the medieval 
<br>
alchemist takes refuge in his ignorance for it lets him continue hoping, 
<br>
the same way people take refuge in the ignorance that lets them believe in 
<br>
creationism.  And it is so easy, if you are a medieval alchemist, to say 
<br>
that you don't know; for indeed you don't.  It sounds so humble and 
<br>
scientific, to admit one's ignorance, on those occasions when it is 
<br>
politically convenient to be ignorant.  The more ignorance the better, if 
<br>
it lets you avoid changing your behaviors.
<br>
<p>Our medieval alchemist died in the moment when he decided to be proud of 
<br>
not knowing.
<br>
<p>I know many specific problems that are necessary but not sufficient to FAI, 
<br>
all of which, supposedly, will be solved by accident.  There will be an 
<br>
intrinsic (if humanly uncomputable) minimum complexity, and the chance of 
<br>
this complexity materializing from nowhere will be 2^-Kolmogorov(FAI), 
<br>
probably far less likely than your lottery ticket winning (but no one can 
<br>
PROVE your numbers won't win; indeed, no one can PROVE the Sun will rise 
<br>
tomorrow, and therefore all beliefs have equivalent credibility and you can 
<br>
believe whatever you want).  I can take proposals for AI morality and shoot 
<br>
them down one by one - including CFAI, by the way.  And every time, the 
<br>
six-year-old with the chemistry set says, &quot;Oh, but I would never do *that*, 
<br>
I'm not stupid, I'd do this instead,&quot; and proposes another lethal thing.  I 
<br>
can point out how the proposed system appears to work just fine, just as 
<br>
planned, providing plenty of positive reinforcement and wonderful 
<br>
discoveries to the happy programmers, so long as the AI can't rewrite its 
<br>
own code or is subject to threat of enforcement by the programmers.  Which 
<br>
system will then tile the solar system with tiny smiley faces as soon as 
<br>
the AI begins operating in a new domain.  And even after people acknowledge 
<br>
the silent kill - oh, pardon me, the *possibility* of the silent kill - 
<br>
they will go on talking about &quot;working it out by experiment&quot;, which also 
<br>
sounds very scientific except that the negative experimental result is a 
<br>
thud followed by six billion other thuds.
<br>
<p>No, I suppose it's not a &quot;zero&quot; chance, but there are laws of rational 
<br>
reasoning that apply to such problems.  When you specify a complex outcome, 
<br>
you measure the amount of complex information in that outcome, and that 
<br>
tells you the improbability of the specific complex miracle needed to 
<br>
produce that outcome by accident, unless someone else comes up with a short 
<br>
computer program showing that the Kolmogorov complexity is less than it 
<br>
appears.  And for basic information-theoretical reasons, one may not 
<br>
*expect* or *hope* for a short computer program in an arbitrary case.  But 
<br>
I cannot PROVE that there is no Turing machine with less than 64 states 
<br>
that outputs a Friendly AI design in Python with comments in Quenya poetry, 
<br>
save by exploring the complete space of Turing machines with less than 64 
<br>
states.
<br>
<p>I am reminded of the story (presented as true; I have not verified it) that 
<br>
when the Australian government decided to start a national lottery, the 
<br>
reporters interviewed some guy on the street and asked him if he was going 
<br>
to buy lottery tickets.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he said.  &quot;What do you think are your 
<br>
chances of winning?&quot; the reporters asked.  &quot;Fifty-fifty,&quot; he said, &quot;either 
<br>
I win or I don't.&quot;  The moral being that you cannot apply the Principle of 
<br>
Indifference to surface outcomes; you need to apply it to exchangeable 
<br>
instances of the set of lottery ball sequences.  Being completely ignorant 
<br>
of something, as I am completely ignorant of the results of turning a 
<br>
six-year-old loose in a biochemistry lab, or as I am completely ignorant of 
<br>
the results of throwing together an AI at random, does not mean that the 
<br>
chance of any surface description holding true is fifty-fifty.  There is  a 
<br>
mathematics of complete ignorance that does not allow you to hope for 
<br>
specific complex outcomes.  But of course people *do* take refuge in their 
<br>
complete ignorance of the lottery numbers, and say, &quot;But you can't prove my 
<br>
numbers won't win.&quot;
