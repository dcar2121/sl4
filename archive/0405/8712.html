Hi Samantha,  
<br>
<p>You said:
<br>
<em>&gt; Higher intelligence can always be used for good or ill.   If we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not already surrounded with problems arguably beyond our abilities to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve then it might make sense to put off increasing human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence. 
</em><br>
<p>It would be great to be able to apply more intelligence to solving the 
<br>
problems humanity is causing, but with the current way ways that 
<br>
people live across the globe and the power structures that we create or 
<br>
allow to remain in place it is not clear that increasing the amount of 
<br>
intelligence grunt or the capability levels will result in any improvement 
<br>
if most of that intelligence increment is not applied to solving these 
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>We have a huge amount of hardware capable of delivering high 
<br>
intelligence that is underutilised due to a failure to engage in the 
<br>
necessary software development - I'm referring of course to the fact 
<br>
that most humans are not adequately educated and hence they fail to 
<br>
develop their full applied intelligence potential.
<br>
<p>Also we have cultures in most parts of the world where people don't 
<br>
believe they should apply their personal intelligence to helping to solve 
<br>
the world's problems so while the intelligence grunt is there, it is simply 
<br>
not applied to the most serious problem areas in sufficient quantities.
<br>
<p>I know there are a few people who think I have a naive belief in the 
<br>
ability of humans to solve their own problems, but I think there is a 
<br>
good case to be made that much of the apparently intractable nature of 
<br>
human problems lies in our cultural presumptions that it is sensible to 
<br>
devote most of our resources to the private or local needs and to fail to 
<br>
invest time and effort in solving problems that arise through the 
<br>
dynamics of the wider community.
<br>
<p>One area where I think advanced machine intelligence could help is in 
<br>
its capacity to do massive effective modelling of complex issues so that 
<br>
people have more effective what-if scenarios to learn from.  We can 
<br>
clearly benefit greatly from working with machine intelligence in this 
<br>
area because humans aren't that good at doing massive transparent 
<br>
modelling in their heads.
<br>
<p>We can see the early effects of this capacity with the climate debate.  
<br>
It's amazing to see the beginnings of major changes in the economy via 
<br>
changes in the policies of governments and big companies based not 
<br>
on an immediate, tangible, large threat but on the basis of expectations 
<br>
of future threats that have been made possible through massive 
<br>
adavnced modelling efforts (via the work of the International Panel on 
<br>
Climate Change).
<br>
<p>What I think we need is a combination of expanded modelling capacity, 
<br>
intelligence enhancement of humans through good nutrition, upbringing 
<br>
and education/training and a huge effort in the area of exanding our 
<br>
human capacity for wisdom.  This is more about *how* to use 
<br>
intelligence rather than just how to get more intellectual grunt.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
