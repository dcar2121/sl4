<p>I suspect (but don't know) that this is not merely hideously difficult

but IMPOSSIBLE for highly intelligent self-modifying AI systems.  I

suspect that for any adequately intelligent system there is some nonzero

possibility of the system reaching ANY POSSIBLE POINT of the state space
<br>
of the machinery it's running on.  So, I suspect, one is inevitably
<br>
dealing with probabilities.

<p>Agreed, of course.  It would also be very hard to create an AGI without
<br>
having a deep understanding of its cognitive architecture -- unless you
<br>
create it by imitating the human brain...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you /do/ have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deep understanding of the architecture, then you don't teach, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you specify
</em><br>
<p>Not so.  The cognitive architecture may be such that learning by
<br>
experience is the most effective way for it to learn.  Specifying
<br>
knowledge rather than teaching via experience may be possible *in
<br>
principle* (it would always be possible in principle for any
<br>
Novamente-based system, for example), but it may be extremely slow
<br>
compared to the high-bandwidth information uptake obtainable via
<br>
experiential learning in an environment.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I wouldn't advocate proceeding to create a superhuman-level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-modifying AGI without a better understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Commendable, but are you sure that you have enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding not to do it by accident?
</em><br>
<p>I have enough understanding to know when there is an appreciable risk of
<br>
doing it by accident.  For instance, now, playing with an incomplete and
<br>
partial Novamente system, there is effectively zero risk.  With a
<br>
complete Novamente system that is enabled to self-modify its cognitive
<br>
schemata, there will be a greater than zero risk, and more careful risk
<br>
analysis will be needed.
