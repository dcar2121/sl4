<p><p>Gah, the point was completely missed.  Let me elucidate a bit, as I've
<br>
actually been thinking about the broader question for some time.  There
<br>
is a subtle inconsistency in the mathematical assumptions of some
<br>
theoretical physics.
<br>
<p>There is nothing &quot;simpler&quot; about the non-deterministic model.  It is
<br>
only nominally simpler if one views the probability model of the output
<br>
in isolation.  Yes, in that case it is kind of tidy to just declare a
<br>
non-deterministic function and walk away.  This is the same kind of
<br>
fallacy as saying that &quot;God did it&quot; is the simplest explanation for
<br>
everything in the physical universe.
<br>
<p><p>Shallow problem:
<br>
<p>In the hidden deterministic model, the probability function is
<br>
inductive, and is only probabilistic in that there is a predictive limit
<br>
because the model is incomplete.  It apparently looks identical to your
<br>
hypothesized non-deterministic model.  However, by definition there is a
<br>
simpler deterministic description of the inductive probability model in
<br>
the deterministic case which will also therefore be simpler than the
<br>
non-deterministic case, since they are indistinguishable from the
<br>
standpoint of induction. This also implies that the non-deterministic
<br>
function is in fact reducible to a simple deterministic description.  We
<br>
may not be able to inspect this simple deterministic description, but we
<br>
can know that one exists.  How is it allowable that a
<br>
&quot;non-deterministic&quot; function is mathematically reducible to to a finite
<br>
deterministic description in theory?
<br>
<p><p>Deeper problem:
<br>
<p>The other point, which is more fundamental, is that a general
<br>
discernable distribution in the output of a function implies determinism
<br>
ipso facto in normal algorithmic information theory.
<br>
<p><p><p>This isn't an inconsistency between competing concepts, this represents
<br>
some kind of pretty basic inconsistency in the application of the math.
<br>
In the non-deterministic models, there is no consistent follow through
<br>
with the mathematical consequences of that model selection, and
<br>
properties are assumed for the hypothetical non-deterministic function
<br>
which are reserved for deterministic functions.  If you actually DO
<br>
follow through and consistently treat that function as non-deterministic
<br>
with all the characteristics implied, the non-deterministic model
<br>
clearly collapses as any kind of reasonable description of the physical
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>I haven't seen this inconsistency addressed.  I've seen some other
<br>
people nibble around the edges of this, but I'm wondering if I'm the
<br>
first person to frame the problem like this. Given that we are accepting
<br>
that the probability functions in physics are real, determinism is the
<br>
only consistent model.  Otherwise, someone will have to explain this
<br>
required notion of a hypothesized non-deterministic function that just
<br>
happens to exhibit the algorithmic information theoretic characteristics
<br>
reserved for a deterministic one.
