</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I see them as being hard to identify. That means we need to broadcast
<br>
warnings in order to educate people, and broadcast channels tend to have
<br>
a surplus of memes competing for attention.
<br>
&nbsp;I also expect that many possible AI developers would be focussing their
<br>
attention on the goal of intelligence to the point of ignoring most
<br>
arguments about how to save the world.
<br>
&nbsp;And I expect that some of the people who understand the risks will be
<br>
eager enough to show off their skills that they will fool themselves
<br>
into thinking that the software they are creating won't become a full-blown
<br>
AI.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;For example, look at the attempt in Engines of Creation to predict the
<br>
development of a global hypertext system. There was one obvious project
<br>
(Xanadu) that had a bunch of smart people who cared about the social
<br>
effects of their ideas, and were probably devoting more effort than any
<br>
other project towards perfecting the design. Then Tim Berners-Lee got the
<br>
urge to write something quick to solve an interesting subset of what
<br>
Xanadu was attempting. And ignored many concerns of Xanadu such as how
<br>
to guarantee scalability, how to prevent broken links, and how to do
<br>
create backlinks so people could find responses to bad ideas.
<br>
&nbsp;It's hard to see how someone trying to influence the design of global
<br>
hypertext systems could have discovered Berners-Lee while he was designing
<br>
the web, in part because that took only a tiny fraction of the time over
<br>
which people were worried about how to do it.
<br>
&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is also evidence relevant to whether we should expect
<br>
Eliezer to create the first AI (although Eliezer seems quicker to admit his
<br>
mistakes than the Xanadu team was, so the analogy isn't perfect). Which is
<br>
a reason not to give up on trying to educate some of the smarter people
<br>
who work on an independent AI.
