<em>&gt; Some examples of possible consequences, off the top of my head:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've got memories of enjoying cheeseburgers.  What happens to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories when the sensory substrate of recollection shifts?  Are you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to keep the old hardware around for recollection?  Will you add 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a complex system to maintain empathy with your old self?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Surely this is rather trivializing of the entire subject?  If we ever 
<br>
expect to upload we have to deal with such an issue but that issue is 
<br>
quite a ways out along the path of self-augmentation.   The immediate 
<br>
first goal is become considerably brighter, fully communicative with 
<br>
one another  and more emphatic/compassionate.  We aren't talking a 
<br>
single leap onto another substrate as a first step.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your old sense of taste was fine-tuned and integrated into your sense 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pleasure and pain, happiness and disgust, by natural selection.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natural selection also designed everything else keyed into those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems.  If you pick new senses, do they make sense?  Does the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern subtly clash with the pattern of systems already present?
</em><br>
<p>This reminds me of the talk we heard at the Foresight Gathering.  
<br>
Everything now is so finely  balanced and wonderful how dare we think 
<br>
of disruptive changes that might lose what we have.   Well sorry but 
<br>
the current state sucks and will lead to our deaths and likely the 
<br>
death of the species.  Disruptive change is already upon us and we 
<br>
better learn to dance as nimbly as we can.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will your new sense of taste be more or less complex than your old 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of taste?  More intense or less intense?  If more intense, does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the new sense of taste balance with a mental system that is known to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stay sane only under ancestral conditions of environment and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurology?  Consider the effects on humans of non-ancestral Pringles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and chocolate cake, loads of sugar and salt and fat not present in any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestral foods. Adopting a more intense taste system can have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same effect, if the rest of the mind isn't upgraded accordingly to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance with the increased intensity of sensation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not interested in changing sense of taste at the moment.  Whether 
<br>
we stay sane in the face of real changes versus trivial made up 
<br>
strawmen is a good question.  But it is not a question that should make 
<br>
us assume that we can afford not to change.  Yes we must exercise 
<br>
caution but that is true along any path leading forward.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Maybe you would prefer to gradually grow into new tastes?  What does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sharp discontinuity of direct self-alteration do to your sense of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal continuity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>That old chestnut!   Wait and see.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; If the new taste sensation is more intense, do you become addicted to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the act of self-modification for more intense sensations?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not if I am sufficiently self-aware and bright enough to augment for 
<br>
strengthened self-control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you really appreciate the long-term consequences of altering your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind this way?  Does the new design you decided upon make any sense 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with respect to those criteria that you would use if you thought about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem long enough?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can appreciate it somewhat today and more so if my intelligence 
<br>
increases in a balanced enough way.   There are limits as to what a 
<br>
given level of intellect can achieve in any available amount of time.   
<br>
The level of intellect must change to accomplish more.   The amount of 
<br>
time available is largely not of our choosing.   I think we have 
<br>
relatively little time.    The only way to make more efficient use of 
<br>
it is to make ourselves as capable as we can within the limits of 
<br>
staying sane enough.  We don't have forever to think about how to do it 
<br>
most perfectly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What is the long-term effect of adopting the general policy of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminating old complexity that inconveniences you, and inscribing new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity that seems like a good idea at the time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what you are talking about.  It is you who came up with 
<br>
this (not very useful imho) example implying such a pattern.  I think 
<br>
it more likely we will become more complex rather than less.  We may 
<br>
choose to focus on something other than taste for an enhancement 
<br>
candidate for a while.    It is not about mere &quot;inconvenience&quot;.  It is 
<br>
about overcoming the limits on our ability to do what we can to produce 
<br>
a positive outcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Other humans share your current taste sensations.  Think of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awkward refusal of foods at dinner, the mainstream artistry of cooking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll no longer be able to appreciate.  Are you distancing yourself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the rest of humanity?  Lest someone chime in that diversity is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically good, let me add that this is one hell of a nontrivial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sigh.  This is surely a very minor awkwardness and not exactly a high 
<br>
consideration when we are talking about our very survival.  Again, why 
<br>
play this game around something as mundane as taste?   Why pretend I 
<br>
intend things I do not?    If there is a subtle layer beneath this 
<br>
approach I am missing then please speak more plainly.  On the face of 
<br>
it this is bordering on the absurd.
