Works for me, and I'm really not interested in going down the 'what if 
<br>
it's such a good simulation that we can't tell the difference' rat hole. 
<br>
So, if we admit the above as an axiom, how does it jive with our other 
<br>
observations and theorems regarding the conscious experience and all 
<br>
that comes with it?
<br>
<p>My own thinking on the subject actually admits of a spectrum of both 
<br>
intelligence and consciousness, in a roughly ordered continuum from the 
<br>
most primitive information processing life forms to the most complex. 
<br>
Thus, questions regarding whether a dog, for example, has consciousness 
<br>
can be quickly dispatched with the answer 'yes, but they are not as 
<br>
conscious as humans'. In addition to the degree of consciousness, this 
<br>
perspective allows for different kinds of intelligence (as information 
<br>
processing) and, hence, consciousness as well. From the above 
<br>
assumptions, it is reasonable to conclude that an animal which sees 
<br>
different wavelengths of light than humans do, thereby processing 
<br>
information about the physical world that humans do not have direct 
<br>
access to with our natural senses, has a different form of consciousness 
<br>
than humans do - less in some regards, but more in others.

<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure. That's a good rule of thumb for humans rightnow, but in [the] future there may be highly &quot;intelligent&quot; systems (in some senses of the word &quot;intelligence&quot;) that both claim and appear not to be conscious. I guess that the current notion of &quot;intelligence&quot; is too coarse to deal with the variety of &quot;intelligent&quot; systems that are going to appear in the future.

Okay, now consider that in terms of what I wrote above - I think you'll 
<br>
find that it meshes nicely.  :-)
