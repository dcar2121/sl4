<em>&gt; Conclusions:  Higher level forms of qualia are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtained through multiple recursion of the laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic.  Brains are the physical expression of the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of logic undergoing multiple levels of recursion to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high degree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Got all that?  Geez, this is all very basic stuff guys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ;) 
</em><br>
<p>Marc,
<br>
<p>Although I find your manner and your style of linguistic expression
<br>
off-putting sometimes, I actually largely agree with your perspective on
<br>
qualia.
<br>
<p>If you're not familiar with it you should check out the work of G.
<br>
Spencer-Brown, in particular &quot;Laws of Form&quot; and the literature that
<br>
others such as Louis Kauffmann have built around it.  Spencer-Brown
<br>
presents a novel formulation of Boolean logic in terms of a single
<br>
logical operator which he calls the &quot;mark&quot; or the distinction operator.
<br>
Thus the basis of Boolean logic is simply 
<br>
<p>* the distinction between figure and ground
<br>
* the possibility of relating two distinctions in two different ways
<br>
<p>If a distinction is written (), then the two ways are basically (()) and
<br>
()()
<br>
<p>His basic logic rules are
<br>
<p>(()) = 
<br>
()()=()
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From these come all of logic, etc. etc.
</em><br>
<p>If you view the basic act of awareness as the making of a distinction --
<br>
the marking-off of void from itself -- then you arrive at, as you say,
<br>
boolean logic as a kind of logic of elementary acts of awareness.  As
<br>
Spencer-Brown observed in the 70's....  Francisco Varela, the system
<br>
theorist, also picked upon on Spencer-Brown's ideas and tied them in
<br>
with Buddhist philosophy.
<br>
<p>However, one thing this Spencer-Brownian boolean-consciousness
<br>
perspective doesn't tell you is anything about degrees of awareness --
<br>
intensities of awareness.  
<br>
<p>If we want to say that the universe is &quot;just&quot; patterns of arrangement of
<br>
basic distinctions -- basic acts of awareness -- then we have a very
<br>
nice model of the cosmos bridging psychological, metaphysical and
<br>
physical perspectives.
<br>
<p>But why are some patterns more intensely aware than others?
<br>
<p>Here we go beyond Spencer-Brown and get into my hypothesis that the
<br>
intensity of awareness associated with a form is related to the total
<br>
amount of patterns in the form.  This is why humans have more intense
<br>
awareness of slugs -- we're more complexly patterned.  (I expressed this
<br>
idea more rigorously in my essay on the hard problem of consciousness,
<br>
which is on the dynapsyc website).
<br>
<p>And another thing this perspective doesn't tell you is why parts of the
<br>
universe act like probabilities are complex numbers (quantum probability
<br>
theory) whereas other parts act like probabilities are real numbers
<br>
(ordinary probability theory).
<br>
<p>Regarding AGI, this sort of stuff tells you very little, I'm afraid.  To
<br>
see that the universe is a collection of patterns recognizing patterns
<br>
in itself, and each mind is a collection of patterns recognizing
<br>
patterns in itself and the world around it, is all very well.  However,
<br>
the problem then comes down to doing this pattern recognition adequately
<br>
effectively within strictly limited space and time resources.  And this
<br>
problem quickly leads you into a load of cog sci issues that lack the
<br>
elegance of the foundational philosophy of patterns, structures, and
<br>
boolean forms.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
