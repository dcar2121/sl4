<em>&gt; I am at a loss to understand what is gained, except a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropomorphizing the issue and avoiding confrontation with that darned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard part of the problem.
</em><br>
<p>OK.  Try this scenario . . . . An FAI believes that it has a good goal
<br>
enhancement.  It tests it.  It looks OK.  It implements it.  Circumstances
<br>
subsequently change in a REALLY unexpected manner.  Oops!  Under these very
<br>
odd new circumstances, the &quot;enhancement&quot; turns out to be catastrophic for
<br>
the human race . . . .
<br>
<p>But wait!  There are three other FAIs that are in close communication with
<br>
this FAI.  Friendliness dictates that they should work in close co-operation
<br>
in order to prevent errors of this type.  The other FAIs have not made this
<br>
particular &quot;enhancement&quot; and correctly evaluate the situation for what it
<br>
is.  They outvote the FAI with the &quot;enhancement&quot; and the &quot;enhanced&quot; FAI (who
<br>
is still mostly Friendly and merely mistaken) rolls the &quot;enhancement&quot; back
<br>
(or modifies it) so that the human race lives for the next moment or so . .
<br>
. .
<br>
<p>Good engineering often dictates redundancy.  Common sense (which ain't so
<br>
common - yes, I know) strongly promotes checks and balances.  Human history
<br>
shows that when diversity of opinion is allowed to flourish that good things
<br>
happen and that when diversity is suppressed that BAD things happen.  You
<br>
seem to be flying in the face of a lot of good consensus about safety
<br>
measures without a reason except &quot;I am at a loss to understand what is
<br>
gained . . . .&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; elaborate network of interacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization processes, threatening each other into not doing certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things
</em><br>
<p>Why would one Friendly AI ever threaten another?  I would think that they
<br>
would work closely and collaboratively to ensure that the best decision is
<br>
reached and implemented (or, at least, to NOT implement decisions that seem
<br>
unsafe).
<br>
<p>Why don't we assume that I'm a Friendly human telling you that I'm pretty
<br>
sure that a single point of failure is A REALLY BAD IDEA(tm).  I would hope
<br>
that you would take this seriously enough that you wouldn't ignore this
<br>
advice and implement your plan solely on the basis of &quot;I am at a loss to
<br>
understand what is gained . . . .&quot;
<br>
<p>By the way, I do understand that you don't acknowledge the distinction
<br>
between multiple AIs with close communication and one AI with partitioning
<br>
but I would submit that one AI with sufficient partitioning SHOULD BE
<br>
considered separate AIs for all intents and purposes.  Or, if the
<br>
partitioning is not sufficient for them, to be considered separate AIs, then
<br>
you need more partitioning in your single AI to create multiple AIs to
<br>
prevent the problem above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or perhaps it would help to have three AI projects competing to achieve
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; threshold of runaway recursive self-improvement, so that whichever one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes the fewest safety precautions finishes first.
</em><br>
<p>Nice sarcasm.  Not at all conducive to an enlightened debate, but elegantly
<br>
done . . . .

<p><p><em>&gt; Which is better for the human species?
</em><br>

<em>&gt; One enormously powerful, recursively self-improving runaway optimization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process trying to tile the solar system with paperclips?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or three enormously powerful, recursively self-improving runaway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization processes, respectively trying to tile the solar system with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paperclips, tiny pictures of smiling humans, and reward-button circuitry?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe they'd fight to the finish, but more likely they'd compromise with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other in a way that simultaneously maximized paperclips, tiny
</em><br>
pictures
<br>
<em>&gt; of smiling humans, and reward-button circuitry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To get *any benefit* out of an optimization process, you have to solve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical problems of Friendly AI to locate the tiny &quot;beneficial&quot; subspace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the space of optimization processes.  It doesn't matter whether you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it using one optimization process, or some grandly Rube Goldberg scheme to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it unnecessarily conditional on an elaborate network of interacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization processes, threatening each other into not doing certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things - except, of course, that the latter is unnecessarily dangerous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less likely to work.  It's just as hard whether you call your working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materials by the irrelevant label, &quot;many&quot; or &quot;one&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or perhaps it would help to have three AI projects competing to achieve
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; threshold of runaway recursive self-improvement, so that whichever one

<em>&gt; takes the fewest safety precautions finishes first.
