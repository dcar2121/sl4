Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The digression into quantum logic and related bits set off some red 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flags in my mind, and after going back and reading some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature, it *really* started to set off some flags.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical models seem vaguely consistent in isolation, but they do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not appear to be completely consistent as a body nor with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available for practical matters.
</em><br>
<p>Quantum logic and quantum probability theory are each consistent in
<br>
themselves, and are each consistent with observed experiments in quantum
<br>
physics.  However, they are competing conceptual explanations for these
<br>
quantum experiments.  In that sense they are not &quot;consistent with each
<br>
other as a body.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1.)  QM models generally assert non-determinism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inappropriately.  They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume literal mathematical non-determinism, but generally make no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction for systems that are not measurably deterministic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are nonetheless fundamentally deterministic.  Expressions of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both cases 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will look empirically identical but the mathematical consequences of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which model you assume are qualitatively different.  There is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification for assuming non-determinism over non-measurable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determinism in practice.
</em><br>
<p>Whether you assume true nondeterminism or not doesn't really affect any
<br>
of the issues addressed by quantum logic and quantum probability theory.
<br>
They are both compatible with deterministic hidden-variables theories
<br>
like Bohm's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The basic problem that I see is that no distinction is made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the math 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between non-deterministic systems and systems which are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterministic in some finite context. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that an assumption of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-determinism is used for some of the physics appears 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect prima 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facie from an information theoretic standpoint. 
</em><br>
<p>As I said, in practice this assumption doesn't seem to make any
<br>
difference.  If you assume a weird enough underlying deterministic
<br>
universe (like Bohm's hidden-variables theory) then you can have QM and
<br>
determinism: everyone understands that.  But for practical purposes, it
<br>
seems most elegant and convenient to make the assumption of
<br>
nondeterminism, as that makes the math so much simpler and fits the
<br>
observed data conceptually.
<br>
<p>An interesting mystery, that making &quot;wrong&quot; assumptions makes things so
<br>
much simpler --- and allows one to elegantly derive theories predicting
<br>
important aspects of reality to within 21 decimal places (or whatever it
<br>
is now).
<br>
<p>Yet more evidence that either the universe is very perverse, or our
<br>
brains are -- or both!!
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
