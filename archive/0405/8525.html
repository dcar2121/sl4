<p>
Pablo,
<br>
<p>Volition involves decision-making.  Decisions-making requires assessments of
<br>
known facts and models of reality, including models about the future.  A
<br>
volitional being makes a decision at a given point in time with only the
<br>
facts and models available to it.  If at a later time the modelled future
<br>
does not match the actual future, that is an inescapable aspect of limited
<br>
modelling capacity.  Taking a god's-eye view and refering to an
<br>
'intertemporal preference set' is a nice thought experiment, but it does not
<br>
point out an inconsistancy.
<br>
<p>You write: &quot;As long as you make the individual the fundamental unit of
<br>
normative assessment, you'll have these problems, since individuals are
<br>
entities that exist over time&quot;
<br>
<p>I agree that this is a problem.  But it is not a problem of defining
<br>
volition, it is a problem of information and modelling capacity.
<br>
<p>&lt;suck-back, reload&gt;
<br>
<p>You seem to be arguing that a being's volition should not be respected if
<br>
another being has more information, or a better model of reality.  I would
<br>
strongly object to this argument.  It goes against the very essense of
<br>
volitional morality, an idea to which I subscribe (at least until something
<br>
better comes along ;)  When beings of substantially different levels of
<br>
intelligence interact (Eg: Human&lt;==&gt;FAI), the one with higher intelligence
<br>
will almost always have more information and a better model of reality than
<br>
the lesser.  Should then the higher intelligence ignore the volition of the
<br>
lesser - or respect it?
<br>
<p>I would not wish to live in a society where my wishes about my own actions
<br>
were disallowed.  Better to have society with the opportunity to learn more
<br>
information, and gain better models **if one so chooses**.  The point:
<br>
beings of lesser intelligence should get to choose their own path - to live
<br>
or die as they prefer.
<br>
