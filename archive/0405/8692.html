<p>Correct.  There isn't even a name for this study, though applied

evolutionary psychology might come close.

<p>True, but there is a lot else there, baggage left over . . . .
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unfortunately, this intelligent system today suffers from a scaling

<p>As bad or worse, they don't understand the emergent origin of war.  A 
<br>
depressing but hard to avoid model is that the human line has been pushing 
<br>
the  limits of its ecosystem ever since we became too dangerous for the big 
<br>
cats to eat.  Population growth or climate upset periodically sets up the 
<br>
conditions for starvation.  If it was not possible to move, then war with a 
<br>
neighbor was better (win or lose) for your genes than starving.  I make the 
<br>
case that &quot;looming privation&quot; turns up the &quot;gain&quot; on xenophobic memes in a 
<br>
population.  In the tribal environment, that synched the warriors to attack 
<br>
a neighboring group.  In the modern world we should strive to keep this 
<br>
trait switched off.

<br>
<p><em>&gt;At this stage, to minimize pain and suffering as humanity moves to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next plateau, we don't need (yet) radical intelligence optimization of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans or AIs.   What we need is the systems-level improvements that will

<em>&gt;and transparency will match and help us handle the threat of terrorist 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;up with a global perspective.
</em><br>
<p>May I cite the dismal history of Easter Island?
<br>
<p>The Easter Islanders used up the environment (particularly the trees with 
<br>
which they could make boats) much like we are using up oil.  When they no 
<br>
longer had boats, they lost the ability to harvest the sea for fish, 
<br>
resulting in &quot;looming privation.&quot;  Because they were all one narrow genetic 
<br>
stock, they eventually split into warring groups over trivial matters and 
<br>
went at each other with rocks till perhaps 95% of the population was 
<br>
gone.  At that point the ecosystem was able to recover somewhat and with 
<br>
recovering prosperity, the psychological mechanisms inducing war turned off.
<br>
<p>There is nothing wrong with large populations.  The solar system could 
<br>
eventually support a thousand times the current population in steady or 
<br>
growing income per capita for a long time.  To get there without wars 
<br>
though requires population growth slower than economic growth.  &quot;Looming 
<br>
privation&quot; especially after a long run of good times is something we can't 
<br>
afford if it leads to wars--and unfortunately that's the situation in a lot 
<br>
of the world.
<br>
<p>If this model holds up under further study and is widely understood, I hope 
<br>
someone comes up with a way to convince political powers.  The current US 
<br>
administration certainly would not accept a model based--as this one is--on 
<br>
evolution.  Nor are they likely to accept that all out birth control 
<br>
(probably including abortion) is the way to reduce social pressures for war 
<br>
and war-like terror.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;*Global thinking will progress to the kind of larger-scope rationality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that makes the prisoner's dilemma and most zero-sum game problems trivial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Intelligence augmentation will progress beyond our currently primitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind-amplification tools and provide us with the necessary capability for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information management and collaborative decision making during the next 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stage, and help us create the future.

<em>&gt;Recently on this list, human examples of enlightened altruism were 
</em><br>

<em>&gt;SIAI and similar efforts play a valuable role in promoting discussion and

<em>&gt;done without requiring machine sentience and recursive self 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modification.  I believe these too will come, but we have to survive the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;global maturing of humanity before then.
</em><br>
<p>I was at a psychology workshop this last weekend.  There were people there 
<br>
who are making remarkable progress on both understanding where we came from 
<br>
and (using functional MRI) how brains are wired up.
<br>
<p>They are the kind of people who understand the &quot;Mamma bear&quot; problem that 
<br>
William Calvin discusses in the first chapter of The Ascent of Mind: Ice 
<br>
Age Climates and the Evolution of Intelligence.
<br>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately, a little arithmetic shows that this story doesn't have a 
<br>
happy ending. How many bears can the environment feed? Obviously, that's 
<br>
the average bear population. And that means, on average, only two babies 
<br>
per mother get to grow up and become a parent, out of the dozen or two that 
<br>
she produces. The maximum population level is not set by the birth rate but 
<br>
by the number of job slots afforded by the environmental niche occupied by 
<br>
bears. . . .&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;That means the average Mama Bear is raising five-to-ten times more baby 
<br>
bears than can possibly survive, absent, of course, miracles -- . . . .&quot;
<br>
<p>The opposition I got to asking how far back it was that humans became their 
<br>
own major predator was really interesting (at a meta level).  It is obvious 
<br>
that hominid lines were able to fill the environment to capacity and then 
<br>
some.  The simple fact that our line spread so far into Asia so long ago 
<br>
indicates population pressure on groups at the population edges.  Behind 
<br>
that edge *something* (or things) held the population to the numbers the 
<br>
environment can feed.  Obviously diseases were a factor, but probably not 
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>But the idea that human line groups killed off neighbors as a regular 
<br>
feature of life long enough to select for a survival response genes when 
<br>
things start to get tight . . . . . I wonder if humans generally have 
<br>
emotional censors to reject such an idea.  Perhaps such thoughts conflict 
<br>
in with our view of ourselves--at least as that view has been shaped by 
<br>
times of relative plenty.
<br>
<p>&quot;Global maturing&quot; may be a lot harder if censor biases keep us from 
<br>
thinking about this class of knowledge.
<br>
<p>Then again, perhaps humans differ in some way from bears and they didn't 
<br>
overfill the environment during the stone age or they had some other way to 
<br>
control populations that didn't involve groups killing each other.
<br>
<p>This might be a bit off from the main topic of this news group.  It is, 
<br>
however, interesting to look at not only the origin of wars but at thinking 
<br>
biases about ourselves.  Such biases could also be at work on our thinking 
<br>
about AIs.
