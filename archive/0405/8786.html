<em>&gt; the alleged &quot;awareness&quot; can't affect Chalmers's brainstate in any way.
</em><br>
<p>A lot of people seem to be ignoring that our physical body, which supposedly
<br>
cannot be affected by qualia in any way, actually spits out sentences like
<br>
&quot;I see the redness of red&quot;.
<br>
<p>If red alone was enough to cause a 'redness of red' quale, then the body
<br>
would not be able to report it because the information &quot;i see the redness of
<br>
red&quot; would not be encoded anywhere, just be a mystical experience arising
<br>
from the lowly &quot;red&quot;. At best we could point at stuff and say &quot;red&quot; but
<br>
never point at ourselves and say &quot;qualia&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, I believe that humans are built with the delusion that qualia exists.
<br>
They are built with neural machinery that spits out stupid stuff like
<br>
&quot;yellowness of yellow&quot;. There is an evolutionary advantage in having such
<br>
kind of delusions, OR they only arise because of an unexpected interaction
<br>
between sensory pathways and self-analysis modules. Otherwise Chalmers could
<br>
not possibly be talking about qualia.
<br>
<p>The biggest conceptual problem to me seems not to be &quot;why do qualia exist&quot;;
<br>
they are there because the brain says so of course - but why can we be a
<br>
process, why can we be locked inside a mind, what is this &quot;I&quot; and how can a
<br>
third person world create it, who decides who you get to be... and so forth.
<br>
<p>We should perhaps be thinking not only &quot;I take for granted that I am me, so
<br>
why do I feel all this stuff&quot; but also &quot;once I get stuck in this brain I
<br>
start hallucinating like crazy but how did I end up in here?&quot;
<br>
<p>This is actually the same problem seen from the opposite side. When you are
<br>
done asking yourself why does the earth stick to the house try asking
<br>
yourself why does the house stick to the earth... :-)
<br>
<p>PS: I think this is my 12th consciousness theory where is my dime???
