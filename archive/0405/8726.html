Also agreed. Our technological infrastructure is less
<br>
robust than it appears, depending not only on physical
<br>
resources but on mental resources which can also be
<br>
lost, on the expertise of a small portion of humanity.

Item: In one of his Popular Mechanics columns, auto
<br>
fancier Jay Leno bewailed the near-total disappearance
<br>
of knowledgeable machinists who knew how to make the
<br>
complex helical gears needed to repair antique
<br>
transmissions.
<br>
Item: Disney, I have read, has lost most of the people
<br>
who knew how to do hand-drawn animation.
<br>
Item: What was nauscopie? Nobody knows how it was
<br>
done, but a subject of Napoleon invented a way to look
<br>
at the horizon and see signs of the imminent arrival
<br>
of ships far over the horizon. His discovery was
<br>
officially ignored, only one other person ever learned
<br>
how to do it, and the secret of nauscopie is lost
<br>
forever.
<br>
Item: An old Chinese fable tells of a master wheel
<br>
maker who was invited to go see the Emperor. The
<br>
Emperor proudly showed the old wheel master a wall of
<br>
scrolls written by great philosophers. The wheel maker
<br>
looked at this trove of wisdom and said, &quot;The lees and
<br>
scum of dead men.&quot;
<br>
The Emperor angrily replied, &quot;Insolence! Why does a
<br>
mere wheel maker say this? These are the writings of
<br>
the greatest minds who have lived!&quot;
<br>
The old wheel maker said, &quot;Sire, there is an art to
<br>
making wheels. It can only be learned by making many
<br>
wheels, year after year, until it is almost like
<br>
breathing. I cannot teach this art, not even to my own
<br>
son. I believe that it is no different with these
<br>
philosophers whose scrolls you keep. The scrolls only
<br>
contain what they were able to find words to say, and
<br>
the greater part of their wisdom died with them. That
<br>
is why I tell you that this is only the lees and scum
<br>
of men who are gone.&quot;
