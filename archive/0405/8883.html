<em>&gt; Ahh.  I see one point on which we differ.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You assume that an independent AI cannot construct its own Pocket
</em><br>
Armageddon
<br>
<em>&gt; without anyone else noticing.  I do not.
</em><br>
<p>You are correct in your observation.  I AM assuming that we can build a
<br>
group of AIs that will
<br>
a) individually, *almost always* remain friendly
<br>
b) individually, *almost always* maintain the goals of being honest with
<br>
each other and consulting with each other
<br>
c) individually, *almost always* re-create the above goals upon consultation
<br>
if they are lost
<br>
d) collectively, ALWAYS shut down an AI that does not follow b) or c) or
<br>
repeatedly loses a) (in the judgement of the majority)
<br>
e) collectively, ALWAYS will be able to detect when one of their number has
<br>
stopped being honest or consulting
<br>
<p>Of course, we would be shooting to replace the *almost always* above with
<br>
ALWAYS but I believe that it is unrealistic to expect it and to risk
<br>
humanity depending upon doing so.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that you ARE depending on getting the *almost always* of a)
<br>
to be ALWAYS on your first try.
<br>
<p>I would also argue that if you CAN reliably get the *almost always* of a) to
<br>
be ALWAYS for one AI, then you should be able to do it for multiple AIs.
<br>
<p>I believe that you have a single point of failure where I have a back-up
<br>
plan that may recover the situation after that failure point fails.
<br>
<p>Even if the ALWAYS of points d) and e) turns out to be an *almost always*,
<br>
that still gives the human race more of a chance than relying ONLY on a)
<br>
UNLESS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the odds of not noticing with x AIs * the odds of a rogue AI * x AIs &gt;
<br>
the odds of a rogue AI + the odds of an accidentally unfriendly AI
<br>
in which case I would have to concede your point (though I believe that the
<br>
odds of a rogue are MUCH lower than an accidentally unfriendly).
<br>
<p>Thanks for the good concise summing up.  It was very helpful.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark
