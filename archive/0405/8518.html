This is *so* off-topic.  I call upon the moderators to chastise me for
<br>
replying to it.

<p>I would like to go on the record as being morally offended by the text I

just snipped.

<p><em>&gt; People who gamble made an act of volition.  Surely we should offer

</em><br>
<p>Of course.  The fact that people might be stupid enough to destroy their
<br>
lives with &lt;insert bad thing here&gt; imposes no compunction on me help
<br>
them avoid it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Both prostitutes and their clients are engaging in volitional

</em><br>
<p>Absolutely; I consider the lack of open prostitution one of the most
<br>
obvious evils of modern American society.  That's not a joke or an
<br>
exagerration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, if we believe volitional morality we should all become drug
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The only thing worse than America's refusal to legalize prostitution is
<br>
its refusal to legalize drugs.  The fact that a country that went
<br>
through Prohibition is stupid enough to try it *again* is so amazing to
<br>
me that I sometimes want to weep.  If you think I'm joking, you might
<br>
want to start with <a href="http://www.sentencingproject.org/">http://www.sentencingproject.org/</a>, 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Forgive my sarcasm.  
</em><br>
<p>I had no idea you were being sarcastic until you pointed it out.
<br>
<p>I had honestly forgotten that intelligent people could *not* agree with
<br>
your statements.  I'll try to do better in the future.
<br>
<p>(My apologies for the USA-centrism, but the stupidities of these
<br>
activities are just more *obivous* here.)
