Hi Ben,  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So far as I can tell, the processes leading to superintelligent AI are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving much faster than the processes leading to the global maturation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humanity, leading me to suspect that in fact the former will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first. 
</em><br>
<p>At one level that's surely correct.  There's no doubt that the technology 
<br>
development is moving ahead apace.  But the trouble is that we don't 
<br>
just want AGI - we want friendly AGI and in a world of 6 (and rising) 
<br>
billion people who are not always all that cooperative and friendly it 
<br>
might be that not very friendly human influences mean that there's a 
<br>
high chance that the first AGIs to gain access to huge computer 
<br>
platforms are not designed or brought up to be friendly.
<br>
<p>So in that sense I think Jef has a point that we need to get our human 
<br>
act together very soon.  
<br>
<p>But my guess is the that getting our act together amongst humans 
<br>
need not be a 1000 year project.
<br>
<p>I've been reading a book by a nonviolence researcher, Gene Sharp, 
<br>
whose works have been used in bringing down dictatorships in Poland, 
<br>
Serbia and several other places.  The US spent $1000m bombing the 
<br>
shit out of Serbia (which given what the Serbian military had done to 
<br>
their neighbours and to the local muslim population might have only 
<br>
seemed fair).  But the investment failed to dislodge the Milosovic and 
<br>
alienatd many people.  Then some parties in the US and Europe put 
<br>
about $15m into supporting a nonviolent movement and the dictator 
<br>
was gone in 1 year.
<br>
<p>My reason about rabbitting on about all this is that when sensible ideas 
<br>
are applied to the change process, humans can achieve a lot more 
<br>
than many of us expect.  A bit more investment of time and money in 
<br>
these human development directions would yield great dividends.  And 
<br>
modest-level AGIs might be able to help with these directions.
<br>
<p>Doing that might actualy improve the prospects of creating friendly 
<br>
AGI.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
