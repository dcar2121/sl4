</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was speaking of me *personally*, not an FAI.  An FAI is *designed* 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Funny, but we seem to have brains complex enough to self-improve 
<br>
extragentically and to augment ourselves in various ways.  We also have 
<br>
the brains (we think) to build the seed of more complicated minds than 
<br>
our own.   I don't see where we aren't designed to self-improve.  The 
<br>
AI will be designed to do it more easily of course.
<br>
<p>I do not see that it is ideal to have the FAI seed be nonsentient or 
<br>
that this can be strictly guaranteed.   I don't see how it can be 
<br>
expected to understand sentients sufficiently without being or becoming 
<br>
sentient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I do not object to the *existence* of a source control system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for humans.  I say only that it should be a last resort and the plan 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be *not* to rely on it or use it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, but I was objecting to lack of such for an FAI as you seem to 
<br>
believe you can think through the design issues so fully as to not need 
<br>
to backtrack.    Many problems in a complex (even if mundane) system 
<br>
cannot be solved on paper or in one's head satisfactorily.   They must 
<br>
be solved in the developing system itself.   From some of your 
<br>
statements I am not sure you fully understand this.
