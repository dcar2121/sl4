<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're right, no contest.  The Borg Hive wants to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly and knows that it can make mistakes unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it consults with Tiny Tim.  It slows down the pace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (not necessarily a bad thing) but it prevents horrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakes.  What's the problem?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>###
<br>
<p>The problem seems to be that you haven't factored in what (significantly)
<br>
more intelligence buys you.  It buys you the ability to deliberately NOT
<br>
make the kinds of errors that would be made by a being with (significantly)
<br>
less intelligence.  Having the 'Borg Hive' consult with 'Tiny Tim' doesn't
<br>
reduce the probability of error, in the same way that me consulting my 4
<br>
year old nephew doesn't reduce my probability of error.  'Tiny Tim' can only
<br>
contribute materially to the reduction of error by the 'Borg Hive' if it has
<br>
relevant information that the 'Borg Hive' does not have.  We already know
<br>
that more relevant information improves decision making, and you have
<br>
already acknowledged that this is not the point you are arguing.  The fact
<br>
that 'Tiny Tim' has an independent process to reason about what it knows is
<br>
only useful for avoiding errors in so far as that process reaches correct
<br>
conclusions AND that process is not evaluated-by or a-subset-of a more
<br>
intelligent process.
<br>
<p>The almost magically wonderful aspect of a significantly greater
<br>
intelligence is that it gets the correct answer reliably more often than a
<br>
lesser intelligence.  Not only that, but I would suggest that any fully
<br>
specified question that can be correctly answered by a lesser intelligence
<br>
can always be correctly answered by a greater intelligence, given the same
<br>
information.  A greater intelligence is not going to discard all the tried
<br>
and true techniques that humans have developed to answer questions
<br>
correctly.  However it will discount the results from those techniques by
<br>
the appropriate amount, whilst considering the results of all the other
<br>
techniques using the appropriate discounts on those as well.  For example,
<br>
if a new situation is so uncertain that one newer type of reasoning produces
<br>
only a 10% likelihood of a correct answer, but another type - say a
<br>
heuristic used by GOF humans - produces an 18% likelihood, then it is going
<br>
to be worth paying attention to the old-style heuristic.  I suspect that
<br>
those occasions will occur, but infrequently.
<br>
<p>Having multiple different FAIs is necessarily a bad idea, but it would be
<br>
more work, and would not reduce the risk of failure.  You have not yet
<br>
provided a convincing argument to the contrary.
