<p>I have been trying to work out a system I call the
<br>
Random Mandarin which would be a debugged form of
<br>
democracy. Some science-fiction writers have suggested
<br>
ideas of this sort, but not gone into much detail that
<br>
I know of. Here's a brief rundown of how it would
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>In an Random Mandarin system, policy-setting
<br>
public-servant jobs would be completely separate from
<br>
career civil-servant jobs. One could actively pursue a
<br>
career position, but such positions would never set
<br>
policy, only carry made by Random Mandarins.
<br>
<p>Policy-making positions in the United States today
<br>
include the President, his Cabinet, the Congress, the
<br>
Supreme Court, state legislatures, other judicial
<br>
positions, mayors, and so on. These are either elected
<br>
officials or appointed by elected officials. The
<br>
system is now completely rotten. Clean campaigns are
<br>
inherently impossible. Elections are routinely stolen.
<br>
Money buys power. I like to say that our system
<br>
selects candidates for their ability to be selected.
<br>
They don't have to be any good at the actual job, they
<br>
just have to be good at getting and keeping it.
<br>
A Random Mandarin government would have much the same
<br>
organizational structure as now, but Presidents,
<br>
Representatives, Senators, etc. would not be elected.
<br>
No elections would ever be held again. Instead each
<br>
job would be filled at random from qualified
<br>
applicants in something like a jury pool. Getting into
<br>
the pool for higher positions would require a
<br>
certificate that one has passed minimum requirements
<br>
of sanity and education. Terms of office would not
<br>
necessarily need to be changed, but new rules to make
<br>
it easier to oust incompetents might be needed. I have
<br>
not decided how repeat terms should be handled. One
<br>
does not wish to show talented leaders the door after
<br>
only one term, but one does not wish to have Jesse
<br>
Helmses hanging around for decades either.
<br>
One-term-only rules might be necessary if the
<br>
retention issue opens the door for corruption.
<br>
The selection process would need to be jealously
<br>
guarded against manipulation, to keep it truly random.
<br>
State lottery games seem to provide a model. And it
<br>
would have to be highly illegal to tamper with the
<br>
selection system. I am even tempted to suggest that
<br>
the Constitution be amended to read that the Random
<br>
Mandarin system be permanent and irrevocable, to guard
<br>
against attempts to revive older, discredited methods.
<br>
<p>Under a Random Mandarin system, political parties and
<br>
power blocs would wither. Office holders would be
<br>
beholden to neither public opinion nor private
<br>
interest and would truly vote their conscience. They
<br>
might wish to steer pork toward their home districts,
<br>
but their jobs would not depend on it. The most one
<br>
could do to influence them is sheer persuasion.
<br>
Under present rules, tyranny of the majority is the
<br>
rule. If you are a liberal living in a very
<br>
conservative district (or vice versa), you will never
<br>
get elected to the House. Under a Random Mandarin
<br>
system, it is merely improbable. Recently I saw an
<br>
example of the tyranny of the majority in a driveway.
<br>
People living in the District of Columbia do not have
<br>
congressional representatives, since D.C. is neither a
<br>
state nor a territory. The Republicans have opposed
<br>
all efforts to create a seat for a D.C. representative
<br>
since this very black district would surely send a
<br>
Democrat. Congress as a whole administers the
<br>
government of the District and does so in a
<br>
parsimonious way. The slogan on a D.C. license plate
<br>
which I saw reads: Taxation Without Representation.
<br>
Well, anyway. I am convinced that a system like the
<br>
Random Mandarin, engineered to remove all possible
<br>
avenues of corruption, would yield better government
<br>
for all humans; its only serious flaw is that I see no
<br>
way to get it installed. The people who make the
<br>
decisions now would have none of it.
