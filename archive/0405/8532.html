Pablo,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You seem to be arguing that a being's volition should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not be respected if another being has more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information, or a better model of reality.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; strongly object to this argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, this is not what I'm saying. I probably wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clear enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  Sometimes it is tough to get a point across.  Thanks for tying again.
<br>
:)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point is simply that to say that what is in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's interests is what the person presently wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not a sound criterion, for it ignores the person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future wants, which are also *her* wants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree that what-is-in-a-person's-interests cannot always be equated with
<br>
what-the-person-presently-wants.  But I think that you omitted mentioning
<br>
the cases where a person understands that their future wants will be
<br>
different, and factors that into their decision-making process.  I do this
<br>
all the time, and I'm sure you do also.  Eg: Though I desire an espresso
<br>
now, I know that if I drink one I'll have trouble falling asleep later, so I
<br>
make myself a warm milk instead.
<br>
<p>I suggest that it is irrelavent to the application of volitional morality
<br>
for third parties to consider what-is-in-a-person's-interest.  We should
<br>
respect the volition of what-the-person-presently-wants regardless of
<br>
whether or not it is in their interest, present or future.  Eg: I desire an
<br>
espresso, and even though I'll have trouble falling asleep later, I really
<br>
love my strong coffee so I make a double.
<br>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong, if I saw someone about to do something I considered
<br>
really detrimental to themselves (present or future), I would try warning
<br>
them against it.  But I wouldn't go so far as to violate their volition and
<br>
attempt to override their decision by main force.  Eg: If I go to make my
<br>
double espresso and a friend warns me against it, that is morally positive;
<br>
but if that friend physically prevents me from making my espresso, that is
<br>
morally negative.
<br>
