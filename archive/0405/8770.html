<p>Degree of intelligence counts.  If the humans building/training the 
<br>
AGIs are brighter then they are more likely to succeed and more likely 
<br>
to succeed in instilling Friendliness if that is their goal.   As I 
<br>
know you have build quite sophisticated systems I know you are 
<br>
painfully familiar with the limits of what even very bright people can 
<br>
accomplish in a given amount of time.   You are quite aware of where 
<br>
the limits are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What this thread really leads to is the (obvious) conclusion that we'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be better off to enhance humans for IMPROVED WISDOM before we enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for improved intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We need both.   One way to proceed is to find relatively wise people 
<br>
and enhance them (if it seems wise to them).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, this seems fairly unlikely to happen, because wisdom, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than intelligence, will be seen as providing less competitive advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the parties pushing for genetic modification of humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not speaking of embryonic genetic enhancements.  There are some 
<br>
gene therapy regiments beginning to appear that seem (in lab mice at 
<br>
least) to enhance memory by roughly 30% and cut learning time in half.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If such works for humans then it would be a candidate.  There are 
<br>
also some new drugs just coming to market that have significant 
<br>
beneficial effects.  Beyond this I believe a lot can be done with 
<br>
computer-based (wearable soon) of human information handling abilities 
<br>
and boosting memory, association, integration,  logic computation and 
<br>
grasping of larger patterns.
<br>
<p>On the wisdom side of it I am less sure what can be done.  I think many 
<br>
can be made wiser by even very old techniques.  But it takes time and 
<br>
commitment that few are ready for.  Plus the older techniques are 
<br>
buried often beneath a lot of superstition and mumbo-jumbo.    That 
<br>
turns many off.   I don't have a lot of hope for many to become wiser 
<br>
quickly.   I do have some hope that a more positive and helpful set of 
<br>
memes can capture the minds and hearts of many.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Genetically engineering a wiser human&quot; is an excellent transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project.  If I weren't so busy with AGI maybe I'd take it up myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully some of the things I'm doing with bioinformatics at Biomind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will ultimately be useful for this goal ... in the unfortunate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstance that we fail to create a benevolent AGI before biotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances to the point enabling the creation of wiser OR cleverer humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by genetic manipulation, that is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We might create highly enhanced humans by accident in reaching for AGIs 
<br>
as we are likely to want pretty tight HCI to the young AGI in its 
<br>
training.
