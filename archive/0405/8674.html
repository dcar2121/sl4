<p>
I continue to be particularly intrigued by these
<br>
recent statements of Eliezer’s:
<br>
<p>“The human ability to employ abstract reasoning is a
<br>
threshold effect 
<br>
that *potentially* enables a human to fully understand
<br>
some optimization 
<br>
processes, including, I think, optimization processes
<br>
with arbitrarily 
<br>
large amounts of computing power.  That is only *some*
<br>
optimization 
<br>
processes, processes that flow within persistent,
<br>
humanly understandable invariants; others will be as
<br>
unpredictable as coinflips.”
<br>
<p>…
<br>
<p>“The essential law of Friendly AI is that you cannot
<br>
build an AI to 
<br>
accomplish any end for which you do not possess a
<br>
well-specified *abstract* description.  If you want
<br>
moral reasoning, or (my current model) a dynamic that
<br>
extrapolates human volitions including the
<br>
extrapolation of moral reasoning, then you need a
<br>
well-specified abstract description of what that looks
<br>
like.
<br>
<p>In summary:  You may not need to know the exact
<br>
answer, but you need to 
<br>
know an exact question.  The question may generate
<br>
another question, 
<br>
but you still need an exact original question.  And
<br>
you need to understand 
<br>
everything you build well enough to know that it
<br>
answers that question”
<br>
<p>[Ref <a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8553.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0405/8553.html</a>]
<br>
<p>Anyone want to comment on these statements?
<br>
<p><p>This led me to the intruiging idea that *degree of
<br>
understanding* is analogous to the *resolution* of a
<br>
picture or hologram, with the image itself being
<br>
analogous to the *mental concept*.  Low IQ sentients
<br>
can still ‘see’ (understand) the hologram (concept),
<br>
they just see it in very low resolution (their
<br>
understanding is very vague and general?).  High IQ
<br>
sentients see (understand) the hologram (concept) in
<br>
high resolution (analogous to a more detailed, sharper
<br>
understanding?)   This analogy does seem rather odd,
<br>
because the model of intelligence would seem to be
<br>
backwards from the conventional understanding. 
<br>
Conventional wisdom is that understanding starts with
<br>
specific concrete examples of a concept, and then
<br>
moves to a more general abstract understanding
<br>
(induction).  But my hologram analogy seems to reverse
<br>
that!  Understanding would start with vague
<br>
abstractions and move towards specifics.
<br>
<p>Keep these fascinating conversations going!  Yes
<br>
indeed - fascinating, fascinating.
