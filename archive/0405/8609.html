</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What does logic or your feelings have to do with it?  We are fast 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developing the ability to reprogram ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>Without the utmost caution, that way lies oblivion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We need not be bound by any supposed past evolutionary imperative that no

</em><br>
<em>&gt;should not lead to believing we are not increasingly free to re-write that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;programming.
</em><br>
<p>You really should read Minsky's society of mind on this topic.  Being able 
<br>
to change your deepest desires on a whim is not a power to be used lightly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It sometimes seems to me that even SL4 folks aren't fully cognizant of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degree of incredible pending freedom.
</em><br>
<p>And after you have removed your basic drives just what are you going to do 
<br>
with that &quot;freedom&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Now, with our memes shaped by a number generations of relative plenty, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;think that killing off the neighboring  tribe's males and taking their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;resources and women is double-plus-ungood.  But if it comes down to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;strong restrictions on breeding or an occasional bout of slaughter and be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;slaughtered, which do you pick?  The simplest math will tell you the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;human race will be forced to picking one or the other, either by our own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;volition or that imposed by an AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It quite obviously comes down to no such thing unless we are foolish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough or simply too slow to grasp and exercise the potentials now before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us.   Why waste valuable time attempting to choose between two obviously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inferior positions in the space of all possibilities?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;(My personal preference is the third way, leave for the far side of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;galaxy and let others figure out what to do.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is also an overly limited and limiting choice in my opinion.
</em><br>
<p>Do you have specific ideas of what to do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Keith, when you wrote: &quot;...understanding these [Ev.Psyc.] matters might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;essential to providing the environment in which friendly AI can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;developed.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;-- Sort of.  It is not the environment that will be improved, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;accuracy of the FAI's human-cognition model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I wasn't clear as to what I meant.  AI research requires considerable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technologic support.  An environment that because of massive resource 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wars lacked computers and even food for the researchers would not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;conducive to much progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Even without improving the human creatures and even without AI or MNT, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is no need for a resource war, especially in energy.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.  30 years ago I was working on solar power satellites, one of 
<br>
the few ways that will solve the energy crisis.  The problem is not &quot;need 
<br>
for a resource war,&quot; but getting one like it or not.  As I put it recently, 
<br>
stone age psychological traits pulling on
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It is more likely we will wreck our economies (as we are doing a fine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job of in the US) and act so belligerently as to bring on a war of most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other countries against the US.   But it will not be over resources per 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; se although that may be the most apparent &quot;explanation&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;It is very important that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;FAI understand the ways in which human think so that it can better model the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;future, and better understand the human-generated data that will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;presented to it.  It is not enough for an FAI to determine that Johnny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;behaves with an approximation to Bayesian rationality 82.6% of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;FAI needs to know what Johnny is mentally doing the other 17.4%, and why,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;and in what situations his cognition is likely to switch between modes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The implicit assumption that humans will remain relatively static must 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also be overcome.
</em><br>
<p>As I put it on another thread:
<br>
<p>&quot;It is a dire and depressing business to realize that genes optimized in 
<br>
the stone age to cope with periodic privation of hunter gatherers are now 
<br>
pulling strings attached to nukes.&quot;
