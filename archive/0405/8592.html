</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I see no reason to believe that even the best of human brains has 
<br>
sufficient capacity to actually understand fully even the mechanism of 
<br>
human brains and thought much less understand fully a superhuman 
<br>
intelligence.  I actually find it incredible anyone would suggest 
<br>
otherwise.  Being incredible, such a suggestion deserves very strong 
<br>
evidence and argument to be at all believable.  Thus far this is not 
<br>
forthcoming.    The best tools I am aware are not remotely up to such a 
<br>
task in the hands of even the most gifted humans or human programmed 
<br>
computers.  We may well be able to build a seed AI, but I believe it is 
<br>
sheer fantasy that we will be able to fully understand it or what it 
<br>
can and may do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So to minimize the chance of an undesireable outcome, we should use 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; techniques we CAN predict wherever possible.  Even in the position 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where we lack any theoretical basis to actually quantify the assurance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of predictability, we can take actions that trend toward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictability, rather than use techniques that are known to reduce 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  In other words, by maximizing the surface-area of our predictable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influences against the rock-hard-problem of FAI, we're more likely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; push it in the direction we seek.  Using a primarily emergent approach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more akin to randomly jamming an explosive charge under that rock 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hoping it lands exactly 1.257m from the origin along a specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heading.
</em><br>
<p>Actually you are most likely to remove all that allows the 
<br>
seed-intelligence to fully develop if you could successfully remove all 
<br>
such possibilities plus all possibilities of it discovering them on its 
<br>
on.   But then, I don't believe that we are competent to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is still there, of course.  Warren Buffet has a first rule 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for getting rich: Don't lose money!  In the absence of statistically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assured predictability, a similiar path here seems prudent.  Don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowingly cede predictability!
</em><br>
<p>Hell, we cede predictability every day in order to get solutions to 
<br>
real problems that work reasonably well.  Full understanding usually 
<br>
arrives some time after workable techniques have been in use for some 
<br>
time, if then.
