<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to be arguing that a being's volition should not be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected if another being has more information, or a better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model of reality.  I would strongly object to this argument.  
</em><br>
<p>No, this is not what I'm saying. I probably wasn't clear enough. 
<br>
<p>I'm arguing at the theoretical level; I'm not saying that gambling or
<br>
prostitution should be banned. Remember that Michael's original
<br>
complaint, which triggered this discussion, was about the undesirability
<br>
of gambling/prostitution, not about the desirability of prohibiting it.
<br>
<p>An analogy may perhaps be of help. Suppose I'm considering whether a
<br>
human foetus has interests. Suppose I conclude that (s)he/it has, that
<br>
it has a strong interest to live, and that this interest outweighs the
<br>
mother's interest in having control over her own body. Well, I may
<br>
nevertheless refuse to make abortion illegal. From the fact that
<br>
something is wrong it doesn't follow that it should be prohibited.
<br>
Prohibition, unlike moral wrongness, is something which has real
<br>
consequences --consequences that may not be morally desirable.
<br>
Prohibiting abortion may actually make matters worse. That's why I'm in
<br>
favor of legalizing drugs, prostitution, and (here in Argentina, where
<br>
it is illegal) abortion. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It goes against the very essense of volitional morality, an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea to which I subscribe (at least until something better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes along ;)  When beings of substantially different levels 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of intelligence interact (Eg: Human&lt;==&gt;FAI), the one with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher intelligence will almost always have more information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a better model of reality than the lesser.  Should then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the higher intelligence ignore the volition of the lesser - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or respect it?
</em><br>
<p>See last paragraph.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not wish to live in a society where my wishes about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my own actions were disallowed.  Better to have society with 
</em><br>
<p>Wait. *Your* wishes are the wishes of a *person*, not of a *temporal
<br>
phase*. To repeat: When you say that gambling is OK because that's what
<br>
the person wants you are ignoring that the very same person will also
<br>
want other things that are inconsistent with his having gambled. So
<br>
unless you say that the present preference for gambling outweighs the
<br>
future preference for financial security (or whatever), you cannot claim
<br>
to be speaking in the name of a person when you say that he wants to
<br>
gamble.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the opportunity to learn more information, and gain better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models **if one so chooses**.  The point: beings of lesser 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence should get to choose their own path - to live or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die as they prefer.
</em><br>
<p>I may or may not agree with this statement (it poses interesting
<br>
philosophical questions to which I haven't given enough consideration);
<br>
in either case, it is not, I think, relevant to the point I was trying
<br>
to make, which is not about how we ought to handle people who act in a
<br>
way we deem contrary to their own interests, but rather about what can
<br>
be said to be in a person's interest in the first place. My point is
<br>
simply that to say that what is in a person's interests is what the
<br>
person presently wants is not a sound criterion, for it ignores the
<br>
person's future wants, which are also *her* wants.
<br>
<p>Pablo
