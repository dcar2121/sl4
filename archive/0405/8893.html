<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I do not like this new policy at all (stated in your WIKI page):
<br>
<p>****
<br>
As an experiment, I am instituting the following policy on the SL4
<br>
mailing list: 
<br>
<p>None may argue on the SL4 mailing list about the output of the
<br>
collective volition, or what kind of world it will create, unless they
<br>
donate to the Singularity Institute: 
<br>
<p>$10 to argue for 48 hours. 
<br>
$50 to argue for one month. 
<br>
$200 to argue for one year. 
<br>
$1000 to get a free pass until the Singularity. 
<br>
Past donations count toward this total. It's okay to have fun, and
<br>
speculate, so long as you're not doing it at the expense of actually
<br>
helping. 
<br>
****
<br>
<p>To quote the character &quot;Chosen&quot; in the immortal classic film, Kung Pow,
<br>
&quot;I implore you to reconsider.&quot;
<br>
<p>I note that a presupposition of this policy is that the only valid way
<br>
to help the Singularity is to help SIAI in particular.  
<br>
<p>Among my practical issues with this policy:
<br>
<p>1) Potentially, this policy would create two classes of posters on the
<br>
list: those who have donated to SIAI, who are allowed to discuss a
<br>
greater variety of issues; and those who have not donated to SIAI
<br>
(perhaps because they prefer to donate to a different organization with
<br>
a different approach to FAI), who are only allowed to participate in
<br>
some discussions.
<br>
<p>2) This policy discriminates against individuals from third-world
<br>
countries, and impoverished people in first-world countries, for whom it
<br>
may not be feasible to donate money to the SIAI.  In other words, the
<br>
&quot;upper class&quot; of posters will be biased to not include poor people.
<br>
<p><p>My first reaction upon reading your announcement of this policy was that
<br>
I should withdraw from the list, rejoining only if the policy was
<br>
rescinded.  But I don't want to be so reactionary as that.  Because, I
<br>
do value some of the discussions on this list.  And also, because I
<br>
consider it likely that this policy is a sort of joke on your part that
<br>
won't be enforced.
<br>
<p>However, I will say this: If this policy is not rescinded, and
<br>
particularly if it is enforced, I might start to find it attractive to
<br>
start an alternate list (<a href="mailto:sl5@sl5.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20I%20strongly%20dislike%20the%20new%20list%20policy%20stated%20in%20Eliezer's%20new%20WIKI%20page">sl5@sl5.org</a>?) for free discussions of the
<br>
Singularity without financial requirements and the ensuing creation of
<br>
multiple classes of posters.  I note that I really do NOT want to do
<br>
this, as I have enough on my plate already.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
