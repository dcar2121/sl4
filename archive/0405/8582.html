<em>&gt; I hope Eliezer has more productive uses for his time. An intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at a DNA-based replicator 3 billion years ago could have made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an educated guess as to whether that would do a better job of maximising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replication than the available alternatives, even if it was impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to predict most of the effects of replication.
</em><br>
<p>To make that judgement the intelligence would have to have a reasonably
<br>
good conception of the entire design-space reachable by evolving DNA.
<br>
This is bad enough even without including methods and results of inventing
<br>
general intelligence, which bloats the space enormously (possibly
<br>
infinitely). It would then have to create at least a good approximation of
<br>
the entire probabilistic tree of all of the replicators, tracking
<br>
population sizes, genetic diversity and speciation, defined probabilistically
<br>
against 3 billion years of volatile environment heavily influenced by
<br>
the evolutionary tracks of the species in it. Had you constrained yourself
<br>
to something more managable like 100,000 years or so you might be able to
<br>
make statements with useful confidence just using simplistic heuristics,
<br>
but estimating germ-line survival over three billion years of planetary
<br>
evolution is a tough job even for a Power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, humans can do a better than random job of comparing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects of different proposed designs for an AI.
</em><br>
<p>True, but it's so hard and so easy to fake that almost no-one bothers.
<br>
Most AI researchers are floundering around based on uselessly
<br>
anthropomorphic insights, inappropriate metaphors and wishful thinking.
<br>
The history of Friendliness theory illustrates how bad even geniuses
<br>
are at a) predicting the trajectory of complex self-modifying systems
<br>
and b) realising how bad their predictions are. If the typical educated
<br>
human does guess noticably different from a random choice, I suspect
<br>
it's worse than random rather than better.
<br>
<p>Every other sort of complex physical system we've encountered has
<br>
required the development of specialised math and analysis tools to make
<br>
sense of and usefully predict. The human brain is far more complex than
<br>
anything else we've encountered and as a result we still don't have the
<br>
analysis tools for it. The idea that you can productively analyse AI
<br>
behaviour, a problem of at least comparable difficulty, using just your
<br>
evolved instincts about goal-seeking agents dressed up with a few
<br>
concepts from CogSci and game theory is broken and dangerous.
