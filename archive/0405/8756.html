<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I think I'll cut short the less interesting and more bickery parts of
<br>
this thread and focus on  the parts with more interesting content ;-)
<br>
<p>One comment first, pertinent to your statement that I never really seem
<br>
to grok your theory of  FAI:
<br>
Have you considered making a formulation of your theory of Friendly AI
<br>
in a semi-axiomatic  form?  Not a full mathematical formalism, but a
<br>
list of say 10-30 brief verbal propositions,  with a clear distinction
<br>
between which ones are assumptions and which ones are supposed to be
<br>
conclusions from which other ones?  
<br>
<p>This would make it much easier for me or others to pinpoint which points
<br>
we disagree with, or  don't understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Your &quot;external reference semantics&quot;, as I recall, is basically the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that an AGI system considers its own supergoals to be uncertain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approximations of some unknown ideal supergoals, and tries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to improve 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; its own supergoals.  It's kind of a supergoal that says 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Make all my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supergoals, including this one, do what they're supposed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do better.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  That was an earlier system that predated CFAI by years - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1999-era or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereabouts.  CFAI obsoleted that business completely.
</em><br>
<p>OK, it may be that I have confused your earlier views with your more
<br>
recent views. 
<br>
<p>Anyway, I just looked it up, and according to CFAI from 2001,
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
External reference semantics:  The behaviors and mindset associated with
<br>
the idea that  supergoals can be &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;incomplete&quot; - that the
<br>
current supergoals are not &quot;correct by  definition&quot;, but are an
<br>
approximation to an ideal, or an incomplete interim version of a  growth
<br>
process.  Under a system with external reference semantics, supergoal
<br>
content takes the  form of probabilistic hypotheses about an external
<br>
referent.  In other words, under ERS,  supergoal content takes the form
<br>
of hypotheses about Friendliness rather than a definition of
<br>
Friendliness. 
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>Does this represent your current understanding of your concept of
<br>
&quot;external reference  semantics&quot;?
<br>
<p>You say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; External reference semantics says, &quot;Your supergoal content is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation to [this function which is expensive to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compute] or [the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contents of this box in external reality] or [this box in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external reality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which contains a description of a function which is expensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to compute].&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>and this clarifies slightly what is the &quot;external referent.&quot;
<br>
<p>One good thing about this idea, conceptually, is that it has the
<br>
potential to make the AI's goal system fundamentally social rather than
<br>
solipsistic.  If the external referent for  Friendliness is &quot;my friends'
<br>
conception of Friendliness&quot; then the society of the AI's friends  is
<br>
brought into the dynamics of self-modification.
<br>
<p>But there are some obvious problems that caused me never to think this
<br>
idea was so important.   Not that it's wrong, just that it's a kinda
<br>
trivial point.  
<br>
<p>I.e.: What is the external referent?  If it's some kind of formal
<br>
description of Friendliness, then all formal descriptions of
<br>
nonmathematical concepts seem to have copious loopholes.  If it's
<br>
something informal like &quot;my friends' understanding of Friendliness&quot; then
<br>
there is too much potential for the AI to influence the external
<br>
referent, thus making it no longer &quot;external.&quot;
<br>
<p>As I recall we discussed this long ago and I never got a response that
<br>
was satisfactory to me.
<br>
