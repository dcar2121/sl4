<p>The actual principle is 'you shouldn't do anything you think might be
<br>
an existential risk until you've worked it through and proved to
<br>
a few relevant experts that it probably isn't'. This won't prevent you
<br>
from destroying the world, but it will prevent you from doing it in an
<br>
aggressively stupid way. This principle failed for Trinity because of
<br>
extreme management pressure to get the job done quickly and flawed
<br>
'someone else will do it if we don't' thinking; it failed for Eurisko
<br>
because no one in AI academia even thought it could be relevant. However
<br>
if you intended to actively ignore it then congratulations, you are
<br>
officially advocating 'risks above and beyond the call of mad science'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. We should just trust that you'll figure it out and single-handedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; save the world.
</em><br>
<p>You may have noticed that quite a few people on SL4 /aren't/ whining
<br>
about not understanding the theory and how this isn't their fault. Or
<br>
perhaps you missed that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My belief is that YOU took a wrong turn very early in the process and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rabbit-holing at an amazing rate.
</em><br>
<p>Teenagers aren't qualified to judge existential risks or do serious science,
<br>
period. It is unfortunate that the pathetic state of academic AI forced one
<br>
to do some of the vital intermediate work. Since everyone else did and for
<br>
the most part continues to do noticeably worse, this criticism while relevant
<br>
does not strike me as calling for a change in roles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Relying upon a single point of failure (meaning both a single FAI and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single you) is incredibly foolish.
</em><br>
<p>This is the best strategy we have for now. However you may have noticed the
<br>
SIAI seed AI team recruitment call in the last newsletter, so if you think
<br>
you can improve on this by all means send someone in or get in touch
<br>
yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, since you don't exhibit these behaviors . .
</em><br>
<p>SL4 is in theory an information-dense debating forum and news feed, not a
<br>
chummy chat list. While in practice we're pretty informal anyway, if you
<br>
want a lighter atmosphere and on-demand snappy explanations please try the
<br>
#sl4 IRC channel.
