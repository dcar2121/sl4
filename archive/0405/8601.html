<p><em>&gt;Too little information about something I build? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly. You only know about the seed AI, that’s all. If you knew
<br>
nothing about oak trees except the DNA sequence in an acorn do you think
<br>
it would be a trivial task to calculate what the resulting tree would
<br>
look like? Could you even tell it was a tree not a bush? And an oak tree
<br>
is not constantly modifying and upgrading itself, a AI is.

<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the fact that with just a few lines of code I can write a program 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that behaves in ways you can not predict does not bode well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for the success of your enterprise. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Eliezer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why? 
</em><br>
<p>Because there was nothing unique in the example I cited, there are lots
<br>
of similar enigmas. Somewhere in that huge planet sized brain there is
<br>
likely to be at least one (probably trillions) tiny sub sub sub routine
<br>
that acts in ways you can not predict. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I have no idea what you think &quot;intelligence&quot; is
</em><br>
<p>I have no detailed definition of intelligence and a doubt one will ever
<br>
be developed that can be written on a paper smaller than a mid sizes
<br>
galaxy. I do however have examples. Intelligence is the thing Einstein
<br>
had and television preachers (and Sea Slugs) do not. On a personal note,
<br>
for me intelligence is the most exciting thing in the universe,
<br>
optimization processes sound like a bit of a bore. Do you really want to
<br>
make a super AI, sorry, super optimization process that is lap dog, the
<br>
slave of Human Beings? Is that even ethical?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Didn't you just get through saying to me that you didn't understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;intelligences&quot;?  How are you making all these wonderful predictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about them? 
</em><br>
<p>I admit I was just guessing when I said a super AI would probably want to
<br>
be happy; I still think it’s a good guess but the only thing I’m sure of
<br>
is that at least some of the things an AI with the brain the size of a
<br>
planet will want I will not understand.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;An optimization process can have complicated ends, and can find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;novel means to those ends.  What I would guarantee is that they will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good ends, and that the novel means will not stomp on those ends. 
</em><br>
<p>How on earth could you guarantee such a thing? I don’t see how your
<br>
mentally shackled machine could ever come up with something really new
<br>
but for the sake of argument let’s say it could; If your machine had been
<br>
the one who discovered nuclear fission how could it know if it would turn
<br>
out to be something good or bad? And even if you can somehow magically
<br>
hardwire unchangeable axioms into the system you’d just be inviting
<br>
disaster. If you say the machine must absolutely positively do X, no
<br>
exceptions, sooner or later it will find itself in a situation where
<br>
doing X is imposable, and then your machine will go into an infinite
<br>
loop.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;An FAI doesn't share the characteristics of &quot;hugely complicated programs&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as you know them.  It may be a complex dynamic, but it's not a computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program as you know it.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?!
