Hi Eliezer,  
<br>
<p>You raise an important point about the perils of too-rapid change.  It 
<br>
allows too little time to pick and choose between new options and to 
<br>
anticipate consequences and to protect past options that you still value 
<br>
etc. etc.
<br>
<p>The funny thing is that the greater the potential for fast change the 
<br>
more we need to be concerned to also consciously ensure that current 
<br>
attributes of the system (ourselves, the community, the environment, 
<br>
etc. etc.) that we still value (or discover that we value when we find that 
<br>
they could be lost) are able to be carried into the future.  It doesn't 
<br>
surprise me that interest in 'sustainability' is growing just at the time 
<br>
when we have such power to change the status quo.
<br>
<p>Far from this interest in sustainability being purely reactionary or pure 
<br>
nostalgia or a way of denying the potential of future evolution, I think it 
<br>
is a sign of wisdom.  Let's go into the future and unfold new potential, 
<br>
for sure, but let's at the same time ensure that this change is 
<br>
manageable - ie. it doesn't lead simply to system break down - (sanity, 
<br>
community viability, environmental viability, etc.)
<br>
<p>There needs to be some sort of productive inter-relationship between 
<br>
the processes pursuing sustainability (continuity of what is valued from 
<br>
the present) and genuine progress (change to achieve new things or 
<br>
states that are valued).
<br>
<p>One way perhaps to get this useful relationship is to actively engage 
<br>
the capabilities created/unleashed by new technology/innovation to 
<br>
help make the sustainability processes more effective.
<br>
<p>Cheers, Philip
