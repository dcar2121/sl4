<p>Hm, I was worried that this might be basically all there is to it.  It
<br>
seems to me that the option of preventing any full-blown AI from ever
<br>
emerging (as opposed to simpler semi-autonomous entities restricted to
<br>
manufacturing/mining/etc applications, against which I see no argument
<br>
but which should need no self-modifying emergent-complexity component)
<br>
is not as futile as all that.  As with WMDs, the most pragmatic tactic
<br>
seems to be to minimise people's desire to build these machines in the
<br>
first place, both by education of the dangers inherent in them and by
<br>
making the benefits of developing them less desirable.  I think of my
<br>
own work on life extension as a substantive contributor to the latter,
<br>
in the sense that with indefinite lifespans we won't be in such a rush
<br>
all the time, so it'll be OK if our machines take a while to do things.
