<p>Software Agents
<br>
<p>To support the future enterprise, we deploy intelligent technology based 
<br>
on a decentralised philosophy in which decisions are made by 
<br>
interacting autonomous units or agents. Global structure and behaviour 
<br>
is emergent, resulting from the cumulative effects of actions and 
<br>
interactions of agents.
<br>
<p>Methodologies for Engineering Multi-agent systems
<br>
<p>We are keen to utilise the knowledge we have developed in building 
<br>
multi agent systems to help ourselves and others in modelling 
<br>
distributed enterprises and building multi-agent solutions. Currently this 
<br>
research is realised by the MESSAGE project and funded PhD projects. 
<br>
Future research is likely to consider how we can add more 
<br>
methodological support to the ZEUS agent toolkit.

<br>
<p>MESSAGE (Methodology for Engineering Systems of Software Agents) 
<br>
is a methodology for developing multi-agent systems. It is a 
<br>
collaborative project conducted by EURESCOM, an institute for 
<br>
collaborative R&amp;D in telecommunications. Also involved in MESSAGE 
<br>
are France Télécom, TILAB, Portugal Telecom, Broadcom, Telefónica 
<br>
and Belgacom.
<br>
<p>While most current software engineering methodologies are designed 
<br>
for an object-oriented approach, MESSAGE is specifically designed for 
<br>
developing agent solutions. MESSAGE aims to extend existing 
<br>
methodologies by allowing them to support agent oriented software 
<br>
engineering. By using such concepts as goal, task, role and interaction 
<br>
from analysis through design and implementation, the developer is able 
<br>
to focus on and document the specific concerns of agent functionality, 
<br>
leading to quick, robust solutions.
<br>
<p>Patterns and Role Models
<br>
We are proponents of the use of organisational patterns and role 
<br>
models in developing agent systems. Patterns are living methodologies 
<br>
that are generative and can deal with change. Role models can be 
<br>
used to describe organisations in terms of patterns of collaboration and 
<br>
interaction. Role models can be used to conceptualise, specify, design 
<br>
and implement new organisations made up of people, processes, 
<br>
agents and other entities.
