<p>&nbsp;It sounds like you're searching for the moral equivalent of the vital force.
<br>
&nbsp;I find it hard to imagine that features that are so deeply hidden in the
<br>
brain that smart people can't specify them have or will determine peoples'
<br>
morality. It seems to fail the basic test of providing an answer to the
<br>
question of what motivates us to adopt it as a moral rule.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I find it easier to understand a behavior-based threshold. The function
<br>
of morality is to enable selfish beings to cooperate. Axelrod's tit-for-tat
<br>
demonstrates how beings with limited abilities to make and enforce contracts
<br>
can improve their interactions - simple rules for deciding with whom to
<br>
cooperate are more productive than the alternatives.
<br>
&nbsp;This leads me to associate rights with (at least) all beings whose
<br>
willingness to cooperate with us/me is is likely to depend upon our/my
<br>
willingness to recipricate.
