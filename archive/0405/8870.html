Mark Waser, you wrote,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, there's always the fact that you really can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have only one, monstrous yet fully-integrated mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The cost of maintaining consistency across a mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scales with size/complexity.  Beyond a certain size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, all you'll be doing is maintaining consistency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If the entire mind is to maintain complete consistency for each and every
<br>
decision, then you are almost certainly correct.  However, full consistency
<br>
may not be necessary to increase intelligence.  I suspect there are
<br>
trade-offs that can be made, and I am currently not smart enough to guess
<br>
what short-cuts a monstrous mind might come up with.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will always have non-integrated parts (also known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as individuals) [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You will have non-integrated parts *if* that is how you build the mind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, it is entirely incorrect to dismiss a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the reasoning process that arrived at it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How then do you propose to judge conclusions, or answers, that have not yet
<br>
been verified against reality but that on which we need to rely?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's one hour before the destruction of the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have twenty doors - nineteen take 50 minutes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traverse and come back, one leads to the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invulnerability of human beings in 25 minutes.  Do I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want one runner or twenty?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>An FAI simply forks twenty processes to do the job.  FAI != human.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You lost me at &quot;one AI cares only about paperclips,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the other cares only about staples&quot;.  They both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care about friendliness. [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yep, you missed the argument.  The AIs being describe were unfriendly.
<br>
Re-read it again without *any* assumptions other than that the AIs have the
<br>
goals as given: paperclips or staples.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe that there is anything that a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual can do that is so far ahead of the curve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it can't be explained in a reasonable amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Believe it or not there is plenty!  I cannot explain any of half a dozen
<br>
subjects I know well to some members of my own work-peer-group so that they
<br>
could understand it, and I'm not even 'ahead of the curve'.  The audience
<br>
might simply lack the terminology and concepts needed the understand the
<br>
information &quot;in a reasonable amount of time&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip] Science isn't magic.  Science, by definition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is reproducible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>AI theory is not like Physics equations.  You can't write it down on a
<br>
single sheet of letterhead.  A good example might be Ben's own Novamente
<br>
documentation - it is huge!  Are you expecting FAI documentation to be any
<br>
shorter?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip] normally I wait to use those words until we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both can point to one pretty low-level fact that is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; linch-pin of both our arguments on which we disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that the community is anywhere near that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point on one FAI versus many.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps this is the crux of the problem, that you are expecting a low-level
<br>
fact but are being presented with a high-level assessment.  I don't know
<br>
about the 'community', but perhaps this reformulation might help...
<br>
<p>It is knowably more difficult to design a set of independent social beings
<br>
that tend as a group to constrain their growth and development along a
<br>
Friendly trajectory, than to design a singleton to do the same.
<br>
<p>There is knowably more risk in failing to get a 6 when rolling a dice
<br>
multiple times, instead of one time - even when the dice is loaded.
<br>
<p>Redundancy is a good thing in certain situations.  It would be very often
<br>
true that a group of three humans could address a challenging problem
<br>
together much more effectly than a single person, even if they each all have
<br>
a Pocket Armagedon (TM), unless one (or more) of them was an intelligent
<br>
psychopath.
