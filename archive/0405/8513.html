Prof. Hanson's paper both predicts economic effects of future artificial
<br>
intelligence as well as the current effects of computerized automation of
<br>
jobs formerly performed by humans that we are witnessing today. In the
<br>
Abstract to his paper, Hanson writes:
<br>
<p>&quot;Eventually, computers do most jobs. At first, complementary effects
<br>
dominate, and human wages rise with computer productivity. But eventually
<br>
substitution can dominate, making wages fall as fast as computer prices now
<br>
do. An intelligence population explosion makes per-intelligence consumption
<br>
fall this fast, while economic growth rates rise by an order of magnitude or
<br>
more. These results are robust to automating incrementally, and to
<br>
distinguishing hardware, software, and human capital from other forms of
<br>
capital.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>If Hanson is correct and wages fall as fast as computer prices do now, we
<br>
are in for a bumpy ride during a historical transition period. (For purposes
<br>
of this discussion, let's stipulate that computer prices fall slower than
<br>
Moore's Law but track that Law.) Since consumption depends on income (which
<br>
is mostly wages for most &quot;people,&quot; or as Hanson has it, &quot;intelligences&quot;
<br>
including non-human ones) then per capita consumption will drop. However,
<br>
with the &quot;intelligence population explosion&quot; Hanson predicts, there may be
<br>
so many more new intelligences that aggregate consumption will increase
<br>
enormously. Which is a good thing, since someone has to buy the output of an
<br>
economy that is growing at least ten times faster than today's mature
<br>
postindustrial economies (which average an annual growth rate of between 2%
<br>
and 4%). If economies suddenly were to grow by 20% to 40% annually while
<br>
individual consumers saw their incomes **dropping** there would be large
<br>
potential for social unrest. Of course, if prices for most essential goods
<br>
and services (food, clothing, medical care, education, etc.) were to drop as
<br>
fast as or faster than wages did, the situation would not be dire. However,
<br>
if the super-high-tech economy were also producing relatively expensive
<br>
luxury goods (like &quot;gotta have&quot; electronics) that lay far beyond the price
<br>
range affordable to most wage earners, there could still be a social
<br>
stratification that might undermine social peace.
<br>
<p>I think we should be concerned about this. If we want to ensure a social
<br>
environment in which FAI and transhumanist goals can be achieved, then we
<br>
need to take care to avoid extreme concentrations of wealth and poverty. In
<br>
general, if we have a kind of Pareto's Law (so-called) distribution in which
<br>
20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth, we should be OK since that
<br>
seems to be the natural ratio (an approximate ratio that appears in many
<br>
systems, by the way, including internet web links). But if we get into more
<br>
extreme differentials, such as 5% and 95%, then either repression or
<br>
revolution become practically inevitable and the chance to build the kind of
<br>
future we want to see will slip away for a long-possibly very long-time.
