<em>&gt; Feel free to explain how a realistic and frightened medieval 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alchemist can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince a hopeful, cheerful, vaguely mystical medieval 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alchemist that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no way to concoct an immortality serum by mixing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random chemicals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together.  Bearing in mind that the first alchemist has to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drink whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the second alchemist comes up with.  Bearing in mind that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is in fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no way to do it, and that being ignorant of this does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change Nature's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law in the slightest.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that the realistic and frightened medieval alchemist
<br>
actually has no way of knowing that concocting an immortality serum is
<br>
impossible.  We know that NOW because of the science we've accumulated,
<br>
but no one could know that in the medieval times.  Alchemy was not as
<br>
stupid then as it is now.  Which is why there were more alchemists then
<br>
than now....  Alchemy is idiotic only in hindsight, which is why someone
<br>
as brilliant as Isaac Newton was an avid alchemist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There is too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much science.  Funny, how the people asserting the ignorance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of science on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some subject are so rarely specialists in that *particular* field...
</em><br>
<p>I am a specialist in the field of dynamical systems (at least, I was a
<br>
few years back, I published in the field, knew all the literature,
<br>
etc.).  So I think I know basically what is known about the attractors,
<br>
terminal attractors, invariant measures, etc. of complex systems.  And
<br>
it ain't nearly enough to tell us anything about the attractors etc.
<br>
that complex self-modifying AI's will get into.  
<br>
<p>Could ideas from some other area of science lead to a breakthrough in
<br>
the field of self-modifying-AI dynamics?  Of course.  It's very hard to
<br>
predict where a breakthrough will come next, and in what way it will
<br>
originate.
