Hi,
<br>
<p>Regarding the relation between consciousness and intelligence, I suggest
<br>
everyone read Benjamin Libet's outstanding work in the neuroscience
<br>
domain
<br>
<p><a href="http://shorterlink.com/?TOD9PD">http://shorterlink.com/?TOD9PD</a>
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.pdcnet.org/volbrain.html">http://www.pdcnet.org/volbrain.html</a>
<br>
<p>This is the only work I know of that really addresses the phenomenon of
<br>
human consciousness in a rigorous empirical way.  It doesn't resolve
<br>
every question, but it says a lot.  The former book in particular is
<br>
very easy to understand yet amazing in its implications.
<br>
<p>My own essays on free will and consciousness are highly in the spirit of
<br>
Libet's work
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/HardProblem.htm</a>
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/FreeWill.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/FreeWill.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Both Libet and I consider subjective experience to be a philosophically
<br>
separate domain from empirical physical dynamics.  As noted in my essay,
<br>
this is in accordance with the ideas of many philosophers such as
<br>
Charles S. Peirce.  We also consider subjective experience as something
<br>
that *naturally emerges* from complex cognitive systems.  In this view
<br>
it is extremely unlikely that it's possible to create a nonsentient
<br>
general intelligence.  But of course this can't be rigorously *proven*
<br>
since we lack a solid theory of either general intelligence or
<br>
consciousness.  
<br>
<p>According to Libet's experiments, it seems that, for instance, when a
<br>
physical stimulus is received by the skin, it is only consciously
<br>
perceived about half a second later.  The moment of perceived stimulus
<br>
is then &quot;backdated&quot; to the actual time of the stimulus.  In dynamical
<br>
systems terms, conscious perception of a stimulus seems to involve the
<br>
formation of some sort of &quot;neural attractor&quot; initiated by the actual
<br>
stimulus (in line with my friend George Christos's notion of
<br>
&quot;consciousness as an attractor&quot;).  This ties in with my theoretical
<br>
notion that the consciousness possessed by a system is connected with
<br>
the patterns that system has recognized in itself.  Apparently, in
<br>
humans, the pattern-recognition subsystem takes a little while to
<br>
respond, thus explaining the delay in consciousness.  But programmed
<br>
responses to stimuli may happen faster than this, because they don't
<br>
require the creation of attractors embodying perceived patterns, they
<br>
just require charge to flow along existing reflex channels.
<br>
<p>In my view, so long as a complex cognitive system recognizes patterns in
<br>
itself, it's going to have a subjective experience.  
<br>
<p>I also argue that any complex cognitive system is very likely to have
<br>
some kind of experience of &quot;free will&quot; -- for similar reasons.  Free
<br>
will has to do with the relation between choices made by unconscious
<br>
dynamics, and the registration of these choices in the mind's &quot;virtual
<br>
multiverse model&quot; of itself and the world.  Any complex mind confronting
<br>
the world is going to maintain a virtual multiverse model, and have an
<br>
experience of navigating through it.  The flavor of this experience may
<br>
be very different for different types of mind of course. 
<br>
<p>Regarding emotion, on the other hand, I have argued that digital minds
<br>
may experience much less emotion than humans, and the emotions they do
<br>
express may be of a very different kind:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/Emotions.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2004/Emotions.htm</a>
<br>
<p>So, in my view, what neural and cognitive science suggest at present is:
<br>
<p>1) AGI's will be conscious
<br>
2) AGI's will have some sort of free-will-ish experience, but probably
<br>
with fewer illusions attached to it
<br>
3) AGI's will probably have far less intense emotions than us, unless
<br>
they're specifically architected to do so
<br>
<p>Since our own ethical behavior is closely tied in with our emotions
<br>
(e.g. love, compassion), and with some of the more illusory aspects of
<br>
our experience of free will and choice, this suggests that the
<br>
psychology of AGI ethics is going to be rather different than the
<br>
psychology of human ethics.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, let me feed this back to you just to be sure I've understood...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your definition of a sentient, or 'person', is a process that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has consciousness and possibly qualia, among other things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, if you can avoid giving a FAI consciousness then you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will feel much more comfortable creating it, performing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source control, etc. as there will be no moral imperatives involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe you are going to have a lot of trouble tweezing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general intelligence away from consciousness.  If you can, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a hell of a thing to see.  For the record: I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to hurt a person either.  Should we hold up creating FAI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we know precisely what a person is?  Until we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurately demarcate the borderline between person and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-person, do we hesitate to create something that might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a person digitally?  If we cannot say just exactly why we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans are also *persons*, then how can we determine the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personhood status of an AI?  You would have to simultaneously 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions: &quot;what makes a human a person&quot; and &quot;what makes an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI a (non-)person&quot;.  Again, that would be a hell of a thing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see.  Is this what you intend?
</em><br>
