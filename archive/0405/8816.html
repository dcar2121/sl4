<em>&gt; You seem to be assuming that intelligence without consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, or at least, easier to come up with than intelligence with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>What we usually call 'consciousness' is one of the primary products of
<br>
the bizarrely broken human self-model. Of course it's broken in ways that
<br>
are non-intuitive to primitive humans, as it wouldn't work otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that were true why did random mutation and natural selection bother
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce an animal that was conscious in the first place?
</em><br>
<p>Random mutation and natural selection don't 'bother' to do anything. They
<br>
are unintelligent physical processes with no ability to plan ahead or to
<br>
focus selection pressure on complex targets. Natural selection follows
<br>
shallow incremental paths and only then when there is environmental
<br>
pressures and time to do so. As the first species on the planet to even
<br>
approach general intelligence, not to mention one that has undergone a
<br>
lot of cognitive architecture extension in a short space of time, we are
<br>
almost certainly a particularly messy and suboptimal implementation even
<br>
by natural selection's usual Rube Goldberg standards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our inner mental lives may be supremely important to us but to evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only external actions are important; an intelligent zombie that acts the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same way we do would work just fine from evolution’s point of view
</em><br>
<p>Large chunks of the human mind evolved to improve competence in tribal
<br>
social interactions. Seeing things from other agent's point of view,
<br>
manipulating them by words, gifts or force and modelling them modelling
<br>
you modelling them would normally all be difficult competences for an
<br>
incremental process to build. However natural selection stumbled on a
<br>
convenient shortcut (i.e. shallow incremental path); implement empathy
<br>
by putting in the ability to supervene on cognition and use a brain's
<br>
own wetware as the simulator for similar wetware in other brains, then
<br>
extend the (rapidly growing) ability to introspect with a clear self/other
<br>
distinction and limited visibility of the self-centred goal system.
<br>
<p>There's more to consciousness than just that, but this is a good example
<br>
of how natural selection just does bizarre stuff at times, particularly in
<br>
rapidly evolving branches of the reproductive tree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...there would be no point in going to the trouble to come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness unless you can’t have intelligence without consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>There are lots of design features of humans that aren't optimal or are
<br>
just side effects, even for living in hunter-gatherer tribes. Consciousness
<br>
is in the first class, the philosophical knots a small fraction of the
<br>
population end up in are in the second class.
