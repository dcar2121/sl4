<em>&gt;All this talk about 'best interest' drives me a little nuts... but I gues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is okay because it promts me into thinking productively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I recently discussed the Big Brother aspect of FAI with an intelligent

</em><br>
<em>&gt;examples lead me to greater thought on the subject.  My earlier conclusions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that volitional morality will be very important to our freedom and safety in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the future, have gained even more validity as a result of more detailed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking on the issue. Also this thread, and the discussion of FAIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;estimating 'best interest', has driven me to articulate in greater detail
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why having FAIs adhere to volitional morality as closely as possible would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be a good idea.
</em><br>
<p>snip
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The morally positive action an FAI might take could again be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;persuasive, non-invasive and helpful - advice, not force.  And again, each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individual would be and should be responsible for their own decisions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As to the problem not being solvable, that is hyperbole.  Humans have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;successfully solving the problem of conflicting wants &amp; needs for millennia.
</em><br>
<p>Longer than that.  But the &quot;solution&quot; often involved &quot;kill them all,&quot; or at 
<br>
least all the males.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure, sometimes primitive mental programming gets switched on and all hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;breaks loose (competition for mates, war, etc.) but most of the time people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trade, negotiate, make deals, treaties and agreements - they sometimes even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;come up with win-win solutions (gasp!).  If mere humans can solve this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem, and on occasion solve it well, then an FAI should not find it too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;difficult to facilitate.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is not negotiating between competing entities, but deciding 
<br>
which one's viewpoint you want to adopt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As for there being a single, universal 'best interest' - that item just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't exist.  Each volitional being decides for itself what is its 'best
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interest', and that evaluation is in constant flux.  It is part-and-parcel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of being a conscious, intelligent being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In so far as a person's decisions/actions are morally negative... well, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a whole-nother post.
</em><br>
<p>The most fundamental actions a person can take involves reproduction.  I am 
<br>
personally *extremely* uncomfortable because the logic and my personal 
<br>
feelings are in deep conflict.  If there is unlimited reproduction or even 
<br>
replication in a limited environment, eventually the population is reduced 
<br>
to extreme material poverty.  They just don't have enough atoms available.
<br>
<p>Worse, humans seem to have mechanisms that evolved to induce wars between 
<br>
tribes when they started feeling the pinch.  If they were successful in 
<br>
raising lots of kids, they hunted out all the game to feed the kids and 
<br>
went into a mode where they slaughtered their neighbors or got slaughtered.
<br>
<p>Now, with our memes shaped by a number generations of relative plenty, we 
<br>
think that killing off the neighboring  tribe's males and taking their 
<br>
resources and women is double-plus-ungood.  But if it comes down to strong 
<br>
restrictions on breeding or an occasional bout of slaughter and be 
<br>
slaughtered, which do you pick?  The simplest math will tell you the human 
<br>
race will be forced to picking one or the other, either by our own volition 
<br>
or that imposed by an AI.
<br>
<p>(My personal preference is the third way, leave for the far side of the 
<br>
galaxy and let others figure out what to do.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Keith, when you wrote: &quot;...understanding these [Ev.Psyc.] matters might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essential to providing the environment in which friendly AI can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-- Sort of.  It is not the environment that will be improved, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accuracy of the FAI's human-cognition model.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't clear as to what I meant.  AI research requires considerable 
<br>
technologic support.  An environment that because of massive resource wars 
<br>
lacked computers and even food for the researchers would not be conducive 
<br>
to much progress.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It is very important that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;FAI understand the ways in which human think so that it can better model the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future, and better understand the human-generated data that will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presented to it.  It is not enough for an FAI to determine that Johnny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behaves with an approximation to Bayesian rationality 82.6% of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;FAI needs to know what Johnny is mentally doing the other 17.4%, and why,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and in what situations his cognition is likely to switch between modes.
</em><br>
<p>That's well stated.  Of course the problem is that Johnny may be in  war 
<br>
mode  17.4% of the time.
