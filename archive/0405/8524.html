Michael Roy Ames said:
<br>
<em>&gt; Adhering to volitional morality would seem to require that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals' choices effecting themselves alone to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respected. 
</em><br>
<p>The choices involved are those of the *individual*, not those of a
<br>
particular and arbitrarily chosen individual *temporal phase*. Once the
<br>
normative relevance of both present and future choices is acknowledged,
<br>
it becomes clear that to prescribe that &quot;individuals’ choices effecting
<br>
themselves alone [...] be respected&quot; is not enough. When the
<br>
intertemporal preference set is inconsistent, respecting individual
<br>
choices becomes impossible. In these cases, one must also provide a
<br>
rationale for favoring a preference subset which, by ignoring some
<br>
preferences, renders the set consistent, and thus operational.
<br>
<p>At t1 Gambler wants to gamble; at t77, though, he wants to pay his
<br>
bills. It is simply naïve to say that Gambler must be allowed to gamble
<br>
because that's what he wants, for he also wants to pay his bills. As
<br>
long as you make the individual the fundamental unit of normative
<br>
assessment, you'll have these problems, since individuals are entities
<br>
that exist over time (immortality may actually make matters more
<br>
complicated, but that's another story).
