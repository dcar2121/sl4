</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Those who attend to transhumanist discussion lists are conversant with 
<br>
ideas of radical morphological change, super-intelligences, and the 
<br>
whole spectrum of possible worlds explored almost exclusively within the 
<br>
Sci-Fi literature and discussion groups such as this one.  We tend to be 
<br>
young, smart, and therefore arrogant to an extent that is appreciated 
<br>
only with increasing life experience.  Although we can't know what we 
<br>
don't know, we are smart enough to recognize this heuristic and use it 
<br>
to temper some of our speculation in the domain of the near-term here 
<br>
and now.
<br>
<p>What I think is under-represented in these groups is an effective level 
<br>
of awareness and appreciation of human nature on the broader scale.  
<br>
Humans are diverse, creative, and driven to improve their conditions. 
<br>
Humans, within their cultural matrix, comprise the most intelligent 
<br>
system we know of.  This intelligent system even has built-in human 
<br>
values at its core!
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this intelligent system today suffers from a scaling 
<br>
problem; the processes that worked well enough at the level of the tribe 
<br>
and village are not effective at the world global scale and humans are 
<br>
at risk of failing due to a lack of global scale &quot;management&quot; 
<br>
(perception, control and feedback) of their vital processes.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, the necessary tools are becoming available at the time when 
<br>
they are most needed.  Global communications and knowledge sharing are 
<br>
increasing rapidly while the economy is evolving to become completely 
<br>
global -- the system is evolving beyond the human scale and humans are 
<br>
taking on the role of functional components.  And yes, along with this 
<br>
ongoing process of growth and adaptation comes some measure of pain, 
<br>
visible in terms of human suffering.
<br>
<p>The point here is that we humans are truly and effectively part of a 
<br>
larger system, and it is to our benefit to see this clearly and use this 
<br>
knowledge to guide our choices.  Working with the larger system means 
<br>
taking actions that make the system function more effectively.  What is 
<br>
qualitatively different about this stage of evolutionary development is 
<br>
that the cells of the organism can now predict and plan, not just 
<br>
respond, to the needs of the larger organism of which they are a part 
<br>
and on which they depend for their survival and well-being.
<br>
<p>A systems design engineering approach can be effective here and requires 
<br>
knowledge of the materials and operating environment (currently humans 
<br>
and their ecosystem and culture) and also requires implementation of 
<br>
effective sensing, control, and feedback processes as mentioned earlier.
<br>
<p>At this stage, to minimize pain and suffering as humanity moves to the 
<br>
next plateau, we don't need (yet) radical intelligence optimization of 
<br>
humans or AIs.   What we need is the systems-level improvements that 
<br>
will allow us to get to the next level. 
<br>
*Further globalization of the economy is key to creating an 
<br>
interdependent planetary civilization where large-scale destruction of 
<br>
&quot;the Other&quot; will become meaningless. 
<br>
*Global communication, knowledge sharing, and adoption of new concepts 
<br>
of privacy and transparency will match and help us handle the threat of 
<br>
terrorist acts, and lay the groundwork for the next generation of 
<br>
humanity to grow up with a global perspective.
<br>
*Global thinking will progress to the kind of larger-scope rationality 
<br>
that makes the prisoner's dilemma and most zero-sum game problems trivial.
<br>
*Intelligence augmentation will progress beyond our currently primitive 
<br>
mind-amplification tools and provide us with the necessary capability 
<br>
for information management and collaborative decision making during the 
<br>
next stage, and help us create the future.
<br>
<p>Recently on this list, human examples of enlightened altruism were 
<br>
presented.  Sidhartha Gautama, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., 
<br>
(perhaps the Dalai Lama should be also included here -- all are 
<br>
unenhanced humans, biologically similar to the rest of humanity, serving 
<br>
as models of what is already within our reach, given the necessary and 
<br>
conducive conditions.
<br>
<p>SIAI and similar efforts play a valuable role in promoting discussion 
<br>
and raising awareness of our accelerating times.  AI will play a very 
<br>
large role in our future, but many on this list may be surprised what 
<br>
will be done without requiring machine sentience and recursive self 
<br>
modification.  I believe these too will come, but we have to survive the 
<br>
global maturing of humanity before then.
