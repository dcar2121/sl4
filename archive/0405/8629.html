<em>&gt; &gt; You really should read Minsky's society of mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on this topic.  Being able to change your deepest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desires on a whim is not a power to be used lightly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I can't say I'm a Minsky fan, but I have read his stuff.  Which essay or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;essays are you referring to?
</em><br>
<p>6.13 in Society of Mind.
<br>
<p>&quot;If we could deliberately seize control of our pleasure systems, we could 
<br>
reproduce the pleasure of success without the need for any actual 
<br>
accomplishment.  And that would be the end of everything.&quot;
<br>
<p>My comments (in 1989) were:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Another problem is how to improve ourselves without getting 
<br>
completely lost.
<br>
Today the mental modules at the root of our personalities change slowly if at
<br>
all.  When our deepest desires can be quickly modified with trivial effort, how
<br>
much of us will survive?  The results of modifying ourselves could be as tragic
<br>
as being modified by others.*  This and nanotechnology based &quot;super dope&quot; that
<br>
make everyone happy but without ambition (or even the desire to eat) are among
<br>
the subtle dangers we face.  It is time for those of us who are concerned about
<br>
our futures to start thinking about these problems.&quot;
<br>

footnote
<br>
Marvin Minsky has a good deal to say about these problems in
<br>
Society of Mind.

<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It sometimes seems to me that even SL4 folks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; aren't fully cognizant of the degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; incredible pending freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And after you have removed your basic drives just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what are you going to do with that &quot;freedom&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a straw man, Keith.  You bought up 'removal of basic drives'.
</em><br>
<p>No, you did, or at least you did if you consider eating a basic drive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that doesn't strike me as a thing to do lightly either, but nobody here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggested taking such steps &quot;lightly&quot;.  In passing I would note that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already do substantial modification of our basic drives through a myriad of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drugs.  There are drugs to increase or decrease appetite, drugs to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or encourage sleep, drugs to reduce pain, drugs to prevent nausea... and on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and on.  Reprogramming would have far fewer side effects, and probably cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less once the basic brain modifying infrastructure is in place to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But this is SL3 territory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As I put it on another thread:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;It is a dire and depressing business to realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that genes optimized in the stone age to cope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with periodic privation of hunter gatherers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; now pulling strings attached to nukes.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Depressing?  Well maybe, if the genes started letting nukes fly.  So far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they haven't - much.  But aren't you arguing both sides of the issue now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Surely it would be preferable to adjust the gene-spun human brains to better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;handle the existential risks they have built for themselves, n'est-il pas?
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that I have recently been thinking about the evolved 
<br>
psychological traits that cause groups of hominids to make  war on each 
<br>
other.  Try &quot;xenophobic memes&quot; in Google to see where it led.
