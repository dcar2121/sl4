<em>&gt; The basic problem that I see is that no distinction is made in the math

</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterministic in some finite context.  And that an assumption of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-determinism is used for some of the physics appears incorrect prima 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facie from an information theoretic standpoint.  One could throw in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunch of stuff about Fisher information etc, but i think the real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem lies in the assumption I already mentioned.  So from this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standpoint, the standard deterministic model would still seem to apply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've noticed that very few papers actually deal with the measurability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of determinism in their models, which is closely related to predictive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limits (how I became acquainted with the concept a number of years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago).  It is nonetheless a very important concept to keep straight when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about computation on finite state machinery because the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences are broad and subtle.
</em><br>
<p>E.T. Jaynes wrote about this very clearly when he pointed out that there is 
<br>
no such thing as a &quot;random variable&quot;.  There are simply variables such that 
<br>
our predictions of them can do no better than maximum entropy.  This 
<br>
inability is a property of our mind, not reality.  Pretending that the 
<br>
randomness is a property of the variable itself is a case of what Jaynes 
<br>
calls the Mind Projection Fallacy.
<br>
<p>The way physics *really* works, of course, certain quantum experiments 
<br>
appear to be &quot;random&quot; because versions of you exist entangled with both 
<br>
outcomes.  If you say &quot;heads&quot;, one version of you shall see heads, and one 
<br>
version tails; if you say &quot;tails&quot; the same is true.  All quite 
<br>
deterministic.  Since I comprehended many-worlds theory and Jaynes, I find 
<br>
that I have absolutely no idea what a &quot;random variable&quot; or 
<br>
&quot;non-deterministic&quot; process might be.  I am not sure that the concept is 
<br>
logically consistent, and it doesn't matter, since in this real world there 
<br>
is nothing non-deterministic.  I have dispensed with the concept of 
<br>
physical randomness, and can no longer imagine what I once thought it 
<br>
meant.  It is like trying to imagine &quot;time&quot; after reading Barbour.
