It's a little embarrassing to admit this but I'm handicapped. When I was
<br>
3 years old I fell off my tricycle and hit my head, I wasn't badly hurt
<br>
physically but it rendered me permanently non-sentient. I think I've done
<br>
a good job overcoming my disability, I do pretty well on IQ tests if I do
<br>
say so myself, I earn a good living, I have friends, I laugh and cry just
<br>
like anybody else, in fact I've done such a good job overcoming my
<br>
handicap that nobody has ever guesses that I'm no more conscious than a
<br>
rock. When I was younger I assumed I was the only human in this condition
<br>
but now that I come to think (thinking has nothing to do with
<br>
consciousness remember, I’ve hears members of this list say so) about it,
<br>
if somebody else was as good at this charade as I am there would be no
<br>
way I could tell.
<br>
<p>Perhaps there are even people who are non-sentient but don't know it,
<br>
they think they know what consciousness is, but really it's like the
<br>
difference between a firefly and a supernova, they have no hint of the
<br>
immense and glorious feeling of sentience that most other people have but
<br>
they do not. This is all speculation of course; I wouldn't know anything
<br>
about it, as I said I'm smart as a whip but no more conscious than sack
<br>
full of door knobs. I envy you conscious beings. I think.
