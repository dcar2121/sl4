To be clear, these are your comments and not a quote? You want to
<br>
discuss this with the list?

<em>&gt; Some points --

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. &quot;Humanoid intelligence requires humanoid interactions with the world&quot; --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MIT Cog Project website
</em><br>
<p>Granted, but SL4 isn't really interested in humanoid intelligence. The
<br>
position of the SIAI and many on this list, if I may speak for them,
<br>
is that strictly humanoid intelligence would not likely be
<br>
Friendly--it would be terribly dangerous under recursive
<br>
self-modification, and likely lead to an existential catastrophe.
<br>
Friendly AI is probably not going to end up being anything close to
<br>
&quot;humanoid&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This means a fully &quot;human intelligent&quot; SAI must be robotic, and as in
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a bit of equivocation here (using this list's
<br>
definitions--not your fault). A humanoid intelligence is presumably
<br>
one that exhibits all the major, pertinent characteristics of a human.
<br>
But the term &quot;human equivalent intelligence&quot;, as used by Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky and most others on this list, means only that the
<br>
intelligence is capable of performing all human tasks at levels at
<br>
least as well as a human. You probably didn't mean this, but I think
<br>
this term is more interesting. More below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An SAI requires the same characteristics as an android, and this sets the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bar for entry into the field of SAI.
</em><br>
<p>SAI here being what? Superintelligent AI? Any intelligence that
<br>
performs well above human levels in all areas? I think this is false.
<br>
It's not obviously necessary that a human equivalent or higher
<br>
intelligence needs any sort of robotic apparatus to attain its status.
<br>
If it surpasses human intelligence by orders of magnitude in abstract
<br>
reasoning or other areas, then it will be able to use its superiority
<br>
in general-purpose ratiocination to fully understand (and thus
<br>
experience, as closely as any foreign intelligence could be able to)
<br>
human experience and intelligence in all other areas, even those in
<br>
which the AI is naturally weak. It will likely be very foreign and
<br>
strange in nature, but capable of relating to us in a fully human
<br>
manner, because of this.
