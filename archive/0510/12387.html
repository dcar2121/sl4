<p>Okay, I want to make a (probably futile) attempt to steer the 
<br>
conversation away from questions of uploading, because I think we are 
<br>
casually using the term &quot;uploading&quot; as it were technically feasible, and 
<br>
the state of the art is so far away from that at the moment that we are 
<br>
in danger of wasting our breath.
<br>
<p>[I feel a little like we are all physicists at the turn of the 20th 
<br>
century, talking glibly about chemical manipulation of molecules (doable 
<br>
at the time) and similar manipulation of hypothetical sub-nuclear 
<br>
particles, as if the latter were just basically the same, but a little 
<br>
more difficult.]
<br>
<p>We must not allow ourselves to be fooled by the exaggeration going on in 
<br>
neuroscience at the moment, and start believing that we might be close 
<br>
to being able to do this.  It is extremely difficult to get down to that 
<br>
level of detail with techniques that are here, or with techniques that 
<br>
are just over the horizon, or even several horizons away.  I seriously 
<br>
doubt that we will be able to upload until such time as we get the AGI 
<br>
and FAI problems sorted out, *then* get our AGI to invent enough 
<br>
nanotechnology to disassemble a brain and upload it.
<br>
<p>Remember what uploading would involve.  You probably have to know the 
<br>
size, shape and possibly the chemical state of every neural cell and 
<br>
every one of its connections to all others, and maybe even the state of 
<br>
all the synaptic buttons, in three dimensions, in circumstances where 
<br>
the darn things are not broadcasting much EM but hiding most of their 
<br>
signals in chemical waves.
<br>
<p>Does anyone out there on the SL4 list have to hand the spatial and 
<br>
temporal resolution of the best of the fMRI systems?  Anyone care to do 
<br>
a quick scale comparison with a synaptic button and an action potential?
<br>
<p>The only good argument against this is that we might not need the 
<br>
resolution.  But at the moment we are clueless about the exact 
<br>
functional significance of the detailed structure.  For example, maybe 
<br>
spike synchrony in the dendritic tree is crucial at the functional level 
<br>
... and if it is crucial, then getting a brain approximately right but 
<br>
with the fine details a bit fuzzy would be about as valuable as 
<br>
uploading two fistfuls of porridge.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>I'm sure there will be some who will argue against this, but please 
<br>
let's conduct that argument in a separate thread (this one), because I 
<br>
think it is a distraction.
