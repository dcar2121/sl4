<em>&gt; From: Olie Lamb &lt;<a href="mailto:olie@vaporate.com?Subject=Re:%20Consciousness%20(Re:%20JOIN)">olie@vaporate.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Many people have more success in carrying on two conversations at once 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they are using different channels - for instance, reading and
</em><br>
listening at once. 
<br>
<p><p>Is this from a controlled experiment? In a controlled experiment, monitored
<br>
by instruments more powerful then subjective experience, subjects can be
<br>
seen to be switching back and forth very quickly, processing one then the
<br>
other, although the subjective experience may be of doing them &quot;at the same
<br>
time.&quot; This is the flaw in your argument. This self-switching is happening
<br>
extremely quickly, perhaps at the speed of light, and fools you into
<br>
thinking you are doing two things at the once. But the monitoring
<br>
instruments prove otherwise.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Furthermore, it is obvious that we can take in many pieces of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information simultaneously,  whether it be many parts of a picture, two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; melodies at once (at least /I/ can memorise two short melodies played 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously and in counterpoint), or sound accompanying picture, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanying touch.  We can simultaneously take in numerous pieces of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information - numerous sources - and process them in parallellll. In the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visual field, not only can we simultaneously take in many bits of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, we can simultaneously recognise several symbols.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think if you were to pay close attention, even your subjective experience
<br>
would show you that you are first processing one sound, then processing the
<br>
other, very quickly. At no single moment in time are you thinking both
<br>
&quot;That is A#.&quot; &quot;and That is D flat.&quot; If not, the experimental data can show
<br>
you this undeniable switching behavior.  
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;However, since Woody's contention that:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the root of Consciousness (is) a focalizing agent, or self, that has no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; option but to switch its focalizing attention to a single source&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be disproved simply by showing that a human can switch their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focalising attention to more than one source, and since I think I showed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several examples of this above, I think that this notion about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consciousness has to go sit out in the junk pile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>My position is that your examples fall flat, and so you haven't disproved
<br>
the Dual Sound Source Experiment at all, and as such my artificial self
<br>
theory is still on the top shelf.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think the &quot;oneness&quot; element of Consciouss is dreadfully overdone.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, I think that it would make for a dreadful test of whether or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an android is conscious (&quot;Can you walk and chew gum at the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time? Yes?  Well, you're not a conscious AI then.&quot;). 
</em><br>
<p><p>In android engineering you are talking about two actuator actions, walking
<br>
and chewing gum. To do both at the same time would simply require having
<br>
one control processor doing one action, and at the same time another
<br>
control processor doing the other action. Or you could have a single very
<br>
fast processor doing both by swithching back and forth, which is
<br>
interesting because it would be functioning like the focalizing agent,
<br>
quickly switching from one action to the other, but so quickly that from
<br>
external subjective experience it would appear to be doing both at the same
<br>
time. This has nothing to do with possessing artificial conscious, as an
<br>
unconscious, contemporary system could do this just as well, so this
<br>
wouldn't be a test of anything, and not what I proposed.
<br>
<p><p>There's a school of psychology that makes a big deal about mono-tracking 
<br>
consciousness: Gestalt psychology. Gestalt psych is a helluva lot more 
<br>
sophisticated than just &quot; people can't carry on two conversations at 
<br>
once&quot;. 
<br>
<p><p>I think that scientists would agree with me that an objective experiment,
<br>
properly controlled, is the definition of knowledge producing
<br>
sophistication.
