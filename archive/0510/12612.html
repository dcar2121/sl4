<em>&gt;Subject: Re: Loosemore's Proposal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Tue, 25 Oct 2005 14:53:10 -0400

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another way to say what I have been trying to say:
</em><br>
<p><p>Go ahead, try not to get too frustrated about it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The question is:  how does the *design* of a cognitive system's learning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanisms interact with the *design* of its &quot;thinking and reasoning and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge representation&quot; mechanism?
</em><br>
<p><p>I think I smell where you are going with all of this, and something tells me 
<br>
to follow my nose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can you, for example, sort out the thinking/reasoning/knowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representation mechanism first, then go back and find some good learning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanisms that will fill that mechanism with the right sort of data, using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only real world interaction and (virtually) no hand-holding from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experimenter?
</em><br>
<p><p>Just as easily as you can start with some basic rules for a learning 
<br>
mechanism and try to retro-fit the representation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or is it the case that you can pick a thinking/reasoning/knowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representation mechanism of your choice, and then discover to your horror 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there is not ever going to be a learning mechanism that feeds that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mechanism properly?\
</em><br>
<p>Apply the same isomorphism as above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, complex adaptive systems theory would seem to indicate that if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;learning mechanisms are powerful enough to make the system Class IV (i.e. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complex-adaptive), the global behavior of those learning mechanisms is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going to be disconnected from the local behavior .... you can't pick a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;global behavior first and then pick a local mechanism that generates that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;behavior.  That is the disconnect.
</em><br>
<p><p>Everyone [should] agree about this. Of course, global and local are 
<br>
relative. They aren't REALLY disconnected. But everyone should agree to 
<br>
that, too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If this were the case with cognitive systems, we would get the situation we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have now.  And one way out would be to build the kind of development 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environement and adopt the kind of research strategy I have talked about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Richard Loosemore.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think the connecting point in this whole dialogue is the paradoxical 
<br>
situation of &quot;where to start&quot;. Actually that kind of sums up artificial 
<br>
intelligence research since it ever existed.
<br>
<p>The reason that this is something we should introspect upon more than what 
<br>
seems reasonable a priori is that, first of all, lots of people have 
<br>
&quot;started&quot; in lots of different places. Second of all, they were all wrong, 
<br>
and, quite obviously, we can look at what they did and try to learn from it 
<br>
(and this technique quite predicably will return some marginal gains in 
<br>
understanding).
<br>
<p>Another point is that, of the psychological and philosophical writings that 
<br>
have been done over the past few thousand years, lots and lots of empirical 
<br>
data exists. Not just &quot;empirical studies&quot;, but actually emprical evidence 
<br>
directly from an introspective point of view; that is, the kind of emprical 
<br>
evidence that doesn't really exist explicitly in some study (and when it 
<br>
does it's too vague to draw any useful conclusions).
<br>
<p>Third, there can be created a few strong points, that are backed not by any 
<br>
elaborate explanation or massive study conducted, but recognized to be 
<br>
important, in some general sense, strictly based on the sort of function 
<br>
they provide. For example, Bayes probability theorem (and damn you if you 
<br>
don't believe it, lol).
<br>
<p>Finally, these few strong points (of which I can't really offer any further 
<br>
examples, but they exist profusely), which were derived not from the fact 
<br>
that strong studies implied their utility explicitly to intelligence, but 
<br>
the fact that the general function (without respect to intelligence), is 
<br>
such that it seems in some sense necessary for it to exist. The primary 
<br>
failure point is not being presumptuous about the utility of your 
<br>
intuitions, but being presumptuous about the implementation of your 
<br>
intuition.
<br>
<p>Thus, it isn't the fact we need to continue to more carefully select our 
<br>
intuitions (which is obviously true no matter what point you are arguing, or 
<br>
on what side you are on), but that we need to be infinitely more cautious 
<br>
about how our speculations about the nature of the implementation of such an 
<br>
intuition actually apply.
