<p>No, but it's what your assertion implies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not a straw man: you yourselves are taking the &quot;logic&quot; approach that I

</em><br>
<p>The scope of 'yourselves' is unclear, but I certainly don't take
<br>
the position you're attempting to dismiss.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stop trying to deflect attention to some other group:  I am talking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about you and your approach.
</em><br>
<p>You may be talking about me, but you are not describing my approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nonsense: LOGI hasn't solved the grounding problem.
</em><br>
<p>True, but it does propose a solution in abstract, albeit without
<br>
much constructive detail. My point wasn't that the problem has been
<br>
conclusively solved, it hasn't, my point was that most researchers
<br>
are well aware of the problem and there have been several credible
<br>
attempts to solve it (most of which await experimental verification).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Cite one example of systematic variation of local mechanisms in complete 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI systems, in search of stability.  There is not one.  Nobody has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried the approach that I have adopted, so why, in your book, is it not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel?
</em><br>
<p>Plenty of researchers have tried a large number of local dynamics in
<br>
their system. Lenat's Eurisko project is a good example; he tried
<br>
hundreds of different hand-created heuristics and numerous structural
<br>
features in a search for a system that would work. This is usually
<br>
what happens when a system is built and fails to live up to initial
<br>
expectations; researchers fall back on trial and error. Eurisko is
<br>
actually a good example of a combination of manual and automated
<br>
trial-and-error; the system itself was a self-modifying design full
<br>
of semi-specialised 'local dynamics', with Lenat providing high
<br>
level guidance and the system itself doing local exploration of the
<br>
design landscape in each revision. I admitt that I am unclear as
<br>
to how you intend to direct your design space exploration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, where else is there a development environment that would easily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow someone who was not a hacker to produce 100 different *designs* of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive systems, using different local mechanisms, then feed them the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same sets of environmental data, then analyse the internal dynamics and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make side by side comparisons of the behavior of those 100 systems, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get all this done in a week, so you can go on to look at another set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 systems next week?
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how you can bypass fundemental limits on how quickly humans
<br>
can invent and input design complexity. Incremental improvements are
<br>
possible with a lot of work, but if you seriously expect to try 100
<br>
designs in a week they will need either very simple specifications or
<br>
will be very similar. This translates into either a very low resolution
<br>
search (if you used some kind of expression system to translate simple
<br>
specs into functional systems) or a very slow search of an extremely
<br>
large design space. This kind of thing could work if intelligence was
<br>
truely modularisable, you had all the essential modules predeveloped
<br>
and you were just looking for the correct way to connect them, but even
<br>
if that was possible it just pushes all the hard work into specifying
<br>
and building the 'adequate set' of modules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I am not talking about you, when was the last time you built a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete AGI and tested it to see if the local mechanisms you chose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rendered it stable (a) in the face of real world environmental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction and (b) in the course of learning?
</em><br>
<p>I haven't done this of course (yet; I'm working on it), but I can't
<br>
see how you can possibly apply this as a research standard. /No one/
<br>
has built a complete AGI yet, and past attempts to do so have taken
<br>
years or decades. It's hard even to find someone who will admitt that
<br>
they tried and failed; usually people say that they had to abandon
<br>
their projects due to lack of time/money/staff, or maintain that just
<br>
a few more years work should crack it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This part does not appear unreasonable; it seems similar to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 'experimental investigation of AGI goal system dynamics' that Ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; has historically been in favour of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have never got anywhere near trying it
</em><br>
<p>How do you know this? You don't, of course. Actually I have got
<br>
about as close to trying this sort of experiment as one can get
<br>
without embarking on a multi-year implementation project. I've
<br>
done a fair bit of exploratory implementation covering a
<br>
reasonably diverse range of basic architectures, of which the
<br>
problem solver based on enhanced genetic algorithms probably came
<br>
the closest to your sensibilities, though obviously the design
<br>
complexity of anything that can be implemented in a couple of
<br>
months is sharply bounded and well below what you'd need for an
<br>
AGI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First-principles research in FAI? You don't have a workable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of FAI, you just have some armchair speculation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have such a theory nor am I working on one. But formal
<br>
theories of this calibre do not pop out of the ether fully
<br>
formed. They are the result of years of hard work on a progressive
<br>
series of precursors, which I /can/ observe the SIAI steadily
<br>
making progress on. I expect that you would write off the entire
<br>
field of theoretical physics as useless 'armchair speculation', or
<br>
at least you would if you could find a way to ignore the successes
<br>
of that discipline.
