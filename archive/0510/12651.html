Greetings everyone,
<br>
<p>Just a quick introduction. I am an ex-programmer who has been working on an
<br>
android brain for 20 years.
<br>
<p>An android brain requires an artificial consciousness, defined as a
<br>
post-contemporary computer system that encodes information and performs
<br>
logical operations on it via a focal point generally named a self. By
<br>
&quot;self&quot; I mean that focalizing agent exposed in the dual sound source
<br>
experiment. The subject had earphones on. On one side was played a
<br>
conversation, on the other was played another. What was revealed is that
<br>
the subject could only attend to and remember one sound source at a time.It
<br>
was impossible to attend to both. So the root of consciousness was a
<br>
focalizing agent, or self, that has no option but to switch its focalizing
<br>
attention to a single source. This self also refers to itself as &quot;I&quot; and
<br>
has personal memory of this I's unique experiences. This self is the
<br>
focalizing agent of consciousness and so must be included in any artificial
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p>Consciousness is also intertwined with and propagated by raw sense data
<br>
(sensor signals), as well as emotional and motivational content that create
<br>
the same interactive effect. So artificial consciousness requires all this,
<br>
and therefore to create artificial consciousness in a robot is to create
<br>
artificial life itself.
<br>
<p>Here is my claim to fame --
<br>
<p>I have just been granted a filing date of 10/25/05 by the PTO for a &quot;patent
<br>
pending&quot; invention entitled &quot;Android and Android Robot Control Method&quot;
<br>
which does all of the above. 
<br>
<p>It is the world's first conscious, thinking android, or Human Artificial
<br>
Life, in the patent records, and this is how I will be promoting it in
<br>
worldwide press releases.
<br>
<p>I am in the process of finding an agent, and licensing the invention to the
<br>
highest corporate bidder. The lowest acceptable bid is one million dollars. 
<br>
<p>For more information, please see my blog,
<br>
