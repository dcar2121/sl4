<em>&gt;&gt;Many people have more success in carrying on two conversations at once

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremely quickly, perhaps at the speed of light,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Sorry, but what the fuck does the speed of light have to do with 
<br>
attention-switching?  Attention can have relation to sensory events, or 
<br>
similar, and so it is relevant to talk about about &quot;rate of events&quot;.  
<br>
However, since the time it takes for a sinapse to fire is many many 
<br>
microseconds, which is many miles at light speeds, C don't enter into it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and fools you into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thinking you are doing two things at the once. But the monitoring
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No, I was not talking from any controlled experiment.  I concede the 
<br>
example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Furthermore, it is obvious that we can take in many pieces of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;information simultaneously,  whether it be many parts of a picture, two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;melodies at once (at least /I/ can memorise two short melodies played 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;simultaneously and in counterpoint), or sound accompanying picture, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;accompanying touch.  We can simultaneously take in numerous pieces of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;information - numerous sources - and process them in parallellll. In the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;visual field, not only can we simultaneously take in many bits of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;information, we can simultaneously recognise several symbols.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think if you were to pay close attention, even your subjective experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would show you that you are first processing one sound, then processing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other, very quickly. At no single moment in time are you thinking both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;That is A#.&quot; &quot;and That is D flat.&quot; If not, the experimental data can show
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you this undeniable switching behavior.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No.  For the musical experience, my subjective experience is strongly 
<br>
otherwise.
<br>
<p>Let us consider for a moment that the minimum duration of experience is 
<br>
1/10th of a second - 100ms. */this seems to be a reasonably widely held 
<br>
idea, but the best source I've found is in Tononi/Edelman's &quot;A Universe 
<br>
of Consciousness&quot;, and is not supported by research or footnoting.  Does 
<br>
anyone know any sources on this idea?  It would be extremely helpful for 
<br>
my PhD thesis!/*
<br>
<p>Now, I can play scales in contrary motion at 6 notes per second (170ms 
<br>
per note).  My mother can play contrary motion scales 4:3 at 120 bpm, 
<br>
which is 125ms and 170 ms.  When I play these scales, I make a very 
<br>
deliberate effort not to concentrate on either scale; I think of the two 
<br>
scales together moving against each other.  Furthermore, I definitely 
<br>
think of two notes as I play them.  If one accepts the 100ms minimum 
<br>
experience duration, there isn't enough time to switch from one note to 
<br>
the other.
<br>
<p>What the hell my mother's brain does to play 4 against 3 contrary 
<br>
motion, I don't know.
<br>
<p>The subjective experience aside, I 'm aware of experimental evidence for 
<br>
gathering more information than mono-track would allow in 100ms.
<br>
<p>There are plenty of experiments that have been done on flashing visual 
<br>
information for only a few miliseconds.  An example is flashing a movie 
<br>
frame (42ms). When such pictures are flashed, people can often identify 
<br>
several pieces of information from them, eg, the colour of several 
<br>
different dots on a 30ms flash.  If one accepts a 
<br>
minimum-experience-duration of anything more than 40-odd ms, then you're 
<br>
going to have to do some fast explaining for why this doesn't breach the 
<br>
&quot;no more than one bit at a time&quot; Css hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Of course, you might argue that the experience of several images are 
<br>
simultaneosly gathered by the subconscious and only then relayed to 
<br>
consciousness, one-at-a-time, but I know a few psych-PhDs who would say 
<br>
this is starting to stray from Psych-Science and into the territory of 
<br>
introspective-psych, which is the domain of cognitive Philosophy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, since Woody's contention that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;the root of Consciousness (is) a focalizing agent, or self, that has no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;option but to switch its focalizing attention to a single source&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;can be disproved simply by showing that a human can switch their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;focalising attention to more than one source, and since I think I showed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;several examples of this above, I think that this notion about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Consciousness has to go sit out in the junk pile.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My position is that your examples fall flat, and so you haven't disproved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Dual Sound Source Experiment at all, and as such my artificial self
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory is still on the top shelf.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I was never trying to disprove the Dual Sound Source Experiment.  The 
<br>
experiment is interesting, and &quot;valid&quot;.
<br>
<p>I was saying that the inferences that you draw from it are bogus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I think the &quot;oneness&quot; element of Consciouss is dreadfully overdone.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Certainly, I think that it would make for a dreadful test of whether or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;not an android is conscious (&quot;Can you walk and chew gum at the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;time? Yes?  Well, you're not a conscious AI then.&quot;). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In android engineering you are talking about two actuator actions, walking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and chewing gum. To do both at the same time would simply require having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one control processor doing one action, and at the same time another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control processor doing the other action. Or you could have a single very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast processor doing both by swithching back and forth, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting because it would be functioning like the focalizing agent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quickly switching from one action to the other, but so quickly that from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;external subjective experience it would appear to be doing both at the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time. This has nothing to do with possessing artificial conscious, as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unconscious, contemporary system could do this just as well, so this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't be a test of anything, and not what I proposed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's a school of psychology that makes a big deal about mono-tracking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness: Gestalt psychology. Gestalt psych is a helluva lot more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sophisticated than just &quot; people can't carry on two conversations at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;once&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that scientists would agree with me that an objective experiment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;properly controlled, is the definition of knowledge producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sophistication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The above experiment might be somewhat objective, but when you start 
<br>
making statements about general consciousnesses, you're in danger of 
<br>
straying out of the objective and into the wrong.
<br>
<p>I mistakenly used a philosophical term - &quot;people&quot; - in a field where the 
<br>
term can be used more broadly.  From the Dual Sound Source experiment, 
<br>
you can infer that /humans/ can't pay attention to two conversations at 
<br>
once, but that doesn't carry for all consciousnesses.
<br>
<p>Just say that an intelligence can pass an elaborate Turing-test test in 
<br>
such a way that it becomes difficult to deny that it is exhibiting 
<br>
conscious awareness.*  &quot;It Passes.&quot;  This happens to be a transparent 
<br>
digital AI on a parallel platform, and we can retropsectively see its 
<br>
computation.  (I think most SL4ers won't have too many problems with 
<br>
such a scenario).  Now just say that we slow it down its mental 
<br>
processes (clock speed) so that it has few to no spare operations, and 
<br>
ask it to carry on two conversations at once, and it is able to, and we 
<br>
examine the computational states, and find that the computational 
<br>
processors are not sequentially switching, but rather parallel 
<br>
structures are working simultaneously on the two different conversations.
<br>
<p>Are you telling me that the ability of this AI to carry on the 
<br>
conversations in parallel is compelling evidence that the entity is not 
<br>
conscious?  Or do you assert that the parallel structures imply that 
<br>
when the AI is carrying on two conversations, it has 2 separate 
<br>
consciounsesses.
<br>
<p>Both suggestions seem absurd to me.
