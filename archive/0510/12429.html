</em><br>
<p>Amazingly there are a nontrivial number of people who use 'emergence'
<br>
as a blanket excuse not to bother thinking about what's actually
<br>
going on. Work by people in this category can generally be written
<br>
off out of hand (at least until they get silly amounts of brute force
<br>
to play with), but the ease of that dismissal should not trivialise
<br>
the overall issue into a binary distinction in understanding. The
<br>
real danger of emergence is a kind of impatience; researchers who do
<br>
make an effort to understand the critical dynamics, but prematurely
<br>
declare their understanding 'good enough', invoke emergence to cover
<br>
the remaining gap and proceed to implementation without an adequate
<br>
predictive model. In virtually any other area of science this would
<br>
be perfectly sensible behaviour, but it isn't in AGI due to both the
<br>
nonlinearity of the solution fitness landscape (i.e. it has to be
<br>
very nearly right to even be capable of produce interesting
<br>
experimental results) and the risks of unintended, Unfriendly
<br>
takeoff.
<br>
<p>Our disagreement over 'emergence' is primarily about where that
<br>
critical threshold for understanding should be (though some of the
<br>
disagreement is probably definitional, or about the actual utility of
<br>
various kinds of informal understanding). It appears that I'd place
<br>
it a bit higher than you, and Eliezer would almost certainly place
<br>
his considerably higher than mine. Really low thresholds (i.e.
<br>
running off and implementing as soon as you have a vaguely coherent
<br>
set of bright ideas) aren't that dangerous, for the reasons
<br>
mentioned above; it's the levels of understanding good enough to
<br>
give a fair chance of cracking AGI but still insufficient to solve
<br>
the structural issues of FAI (i.e. build a controllable AGI) that's
<br>
the real danger.
<br>
<p>This is what Eliezer was alluding to in this piece of black humour
<br>
(in the 'subtleties' section particularly);

<p><em>&gt; What gives map formation the flavor of &quot;emergence&quot; is that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no MapFormation MindAgent (to lapse into Novamente lingo), i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no block of code that explicitly produces maps.  Rather, map
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formation occurs as an indirect consequence of the &quot;localized&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity of a bunch of processes that act on individual nodes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; links, that then coordinate together to cause maps to &quot;self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organize.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Generally I agree with the rest of your post. However this section
<br>
does set off alarm bells, simply because 'self-organising from local
<br>
dynamics' structures (using a reasonably narrow definition; you could
<br>
stretch that to cover nearly anything if you were so inclined) are
<br>
extremely difficult to do well and in a manner compatible with
<br>
reflective transparency and causal cleanliness. I do believe it's
<br>
possible, and you may have got it right, but if so that would be the
<br>
first design I've seen to do so.
