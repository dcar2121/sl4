<em>&gt; &gt;An android brain requires an artificial consciousness, defined as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;post-contemporary computer system that encodes information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performs logical operations on it via a focalizing point generally named
</em><br>
a self. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By &quot;self&quot; I mean that focalizing agent exposed in the dual sound source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;experiment. The subject had earphones on. On one side was played a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;conversation, on the other was played another. What was revealed is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the subject could only attend to and remember one sound source at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. It was impossible to attend to both. So the root of consciousness
</em><br>
was a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;focalizing agent, or self, that has no option but to switch its
</em><br>
focalizing
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;attention to one single source or the other. But therein arises the
</em><br>
phenomenon of choice, of motivational autonomy. This self also refers to
<br>
itself as &quot;I&quot; and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;has personal memory of this I's unique experiences. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This self is the focalizing agent of consciousness, and so must be
</em><br>
included in any artificial consciousness.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Identity and a sense of self  is not a necessary prerequisite for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial mind. The idea that it is comes from human inability to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past our own identities - we feel like focalized agents and can't see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how any intelligence would function without a self too. 
</em><br>
<p><p><p><p>I didn't say &quot;focalized agents,&quot; I said focalizing agents. The root of
<br>
consciousness was shown to be a focalizing agent, or self, that has no
<br>
option but to switch its focalizing attention to one single source or the
<br>
other. But therein arises the phenomenon of choice, of motivational
<br>
autonomy, and of the manifestation of natural human life. And by this same
<br>
process is created human artificial life, i.e., post-contempory conscious
<br>
computer systems. The difference is the difference between a natural, real
<br>
flower and a silk flower. The silk flower looks, smells, and feels like a
<br>
real flower, but it is made of a difference substance, of non-living silk
<br>
material.
<br>
<p><p>The experiment with the sounds shows more about the operations of our
<br>
auditory system than it does that the root of consciousness is a self. 
<br>
<p><p>My position is that the Dual Sound Source Experiment is all we need, in our
<br>
mission to build android industry standards concerning the artificial self.
<br>
The clear fact is that the auditory system is not controlling the observed
<br>
effect. It is not the left ear and/or right ear auditory system that is
<br>
making the choice to attend to one ear or the other. The fact is, the
<br>
subject can attend to WHICHEVER one he chooses, and this leads to the
<br>
practical conclusion that there is a focalizing agent or self that is
<br>
controlling the conscious effect, as the root of consciousness. 
<br>
<p>And so an android should have, by industry standard, an artificial self,
<br>
that is aware of its unique self and personal history, refers to itself as
<br>
I., and functions as the root of artificial consciousness. And this is the
<br>
practical point and my central interest, since I hold an &quot;essential patent&quot;
<br>
for this industry. This is a legal term meaning the corporations involved
<br>
in the industry can't build an android robot using industry standards
<br>
without infringing on this patent.
