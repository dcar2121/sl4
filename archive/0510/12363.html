<em>&gt; Thrun, 38, believes robotic driving will someday advance to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where human geography is changed. No longer will big office buildings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or shopping centers need to be surrounded by big parking lots.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, cars will dutifully park themselves on the edge of cities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waiting for a call to come retrieve their owners.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Long before then, robotic systems will save thousands of lives by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking the wheel at the last moment to prevent accidents caused by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driver error.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thrun confidently concluded: ``It's a no-brainer to me that cars will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive themselves.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>When I talk to other Americans about this prospect, they tend to dismiss or reject it  as somehow unlikely--usually for liability reasons. Some change their minds when I point out self-driving cars mean their children won't have to confiscate their keys from them when they grow too old to safely drive.
