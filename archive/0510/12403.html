<p>Well of course. I don't see how you could reasonably propose to build
<br>
an AGI without doing this. The critical difference between an opaque
<br>
design and a transparent one is that in the later you can understand
<br>
exactly what is going on instead of guessing. The critical difference
<br>
between constructive design and trial-and-error is that in the former
<br>
you implement to test specific hypotheses and go back to the drawing
<br>
board to refine your model if it turns out that they're wrong, while
<br>
in the latter you simply search for things that appear to work,
<br>
without having a preexisting (or in many cases, post-discovery) model
<br>
that explains why they work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; have substantial empirical data that says that if you invent your

</em><br>
<p>Obviously theory doesn't actually /do/ anything until it's
<br>
implemented, and I agree that it's generally impossible (for humans)
<br>
to be sure whether a design will exhibit the desired performance
<br>
without building and testing it. Note that questions of capability
<br>
are /not/ primary goal of FAI theory, which is concerned with
<br>
ensuring that the effects of an AGI on its environment will be of a
<br>
certain type, and makes no guarentees about whether a design will
<br>
actually be effective at achieving goals given some finite amount of
<br>
computing power. That question must be answered (IMO) by rather
<br>
different means, where implementation and experimentation have an
<br>
important role, but in a transparent and constructive context rather
<br>
than an opaque and/or trial-and-error one.
