<em>&gt; We have to build systems that grow their own representations, we cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presuppose those representations and then, later, tack on some learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms that will feed those representations with new knowledge.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental point is crucial to my argument, so make sure that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely clear about that before we discuss fine details about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richard Loosemore
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you 100% that we need to build systems that &quot;grow their own
<br>
representations&quot;.  I don't see what that has to do with your earlier
<br>
comments about the fantastic tools we'll need in order to build AI systems,
<br>
but I'll let that pass for the moment...
<br>
<p>I am not sure I understand what *you* mean by &quot;growing your own
<br>
representation,&quot;
<br>
however.  This phrase is not so well-defined.
<br>
<p>For instance, think about how the human brain represents its tactile inputs,
<br>
using a little &quot;homunculus.&quot;  Each of us grows our own homunculus, it's
<br>
true,
<br>
but we each grow them in the same basic shape and proportions.  The
<br>
homunculi
<br>
are adaptable: if a limb is removed that part of the homunculus goes away
<br>
and those brain cells are used for something else.  But it's not the case
<br>
that
<br>
our brains each individually figure out or &quot;grow&quot; the idea &quot;Hey!  Let's
<br>
build a homunculus to represent nerve impulses from the body!&quot;
<br>
<p>Rather, the homunculus grows as a result of some basic principles, such as
<br>
&quot;If two sensory inputs often occur at the same time, then perhaps there
<br>
should
<br>
be some neuron that responds to both of them.&quot;  I.e., in this case the brain
<br>
contains a hard-wired principle for constructing representations (&quot;wired&quot; is
<br>
being used metaphorically here -- of course there is chemistry as well as
<br>
electrodynamics going on), and uses this principle to construct
<br>
representations
<br>
for particular situations.
<br>
<p>So, yeah -- a mind must grow its own representations for particular
<br>
concepts,
<br>
procedures, feelings, situations, etc.  But it must be given some principles
<br>
and methods and algorithms for constructing representations given various
<br>
sorts
<br>
of inputs (including introspective as well as external inputs).
<br>
<p>But why you think an AGI system that does this sort of thing can't be
<br>
programmed using current software tools, I don't really understand.  I agree
<br>
that it's a BIG PAIN and I wish the tools were better so it would be less of
<br>
a pain, but that doesn't add up to a fundamental impossibility.  I think
<br>
we're
<br>
more in the position of the Wright Brothers trying to build a plane or Ford
<br>
trying to build a Model T, than of Babbage trying to build an Analytical
<br>
Engine.  And I have not heard any convincing arguments from you on this
<br>
point.
<br>
