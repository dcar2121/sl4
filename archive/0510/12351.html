<p>Okay, I'm persuaded.  I had no idea that the published gene sequences 
<br>
were that useful - I thought it was just sheer principle on the 
<br>
journal's part.  (The researchers, according to Kurzweil and Joy, did 
<br>
not want to publish the gene sequence to open-access databases, but were 
<br>
forced by the journal to do so on pain of their paper being refused 
<br>
publication - not that I regard this as a very impressive threat, but 
<br>
maybe things are different in academia.)  And there are other deadly 
<br>
gene sequences out there already, such as, if I recall correctly, 
<br>
smallpox; so publication of H1N1 would only pose a small incremental risk.
<br>
<p>I am not comfortable with the overall situation.  Perhaps someone should 
<br>
monitor the protein synthesis / peptide sequencing machines that could 
<br>
actually reconstruct the flu, in addition to a Manhattan Project for 
<br>
technologies that promise rapid cures for new viruses, Kurzweil's bet 
<br>
being on RNA interference (and it seems like a good one).
<br>
<p>Actually, brief Googling says that smallpox is a huge virus, not readily 
<br>
subject to artificial synthesis (like the short virus polio, which was 
<br>
artificially synthesized by one group of highly trained researchers), 
<br>
and I'm not sure if other short viruses such as Ebola are publicly 
<br>
sequenced.  The argument that we have existing immunity to H1N1 strikes 
<br>
me as weak, but I am not an immunologist.  Taking this into account, I'm 
<br>
tentatively persuaded to Cascio's point, but I'm not very persuaded.
<br>
<p>I reiterate that the end of scientific openness is not the end of the 
<br>
world.  I used to think that way, until I read Rhodes's &quot;The Making of 
<br>
the Atomic Bomb&quot; and Lanouette's &quot;Genius in the Shadows&quot;, and learned 
<br>
that this had happened before, and that scientific secrecy had been 
<br>
successfully argued and successfully implemented in an iffy-seeming 
<br>
early case, and that the results were, if not utopian, then probably 
<br>
better than unrestricted openness would have led to.
