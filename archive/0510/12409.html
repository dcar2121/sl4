</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>It's the other way around; nobody will understand the reasons _until_ you
<br>
give the details. If you don't want to, okay; if you do choose to write up a
<br>
draft spec, I'll try to evaluate it against your motives for creating it.
<br>
<p>I am distressed, because the common thread through all the replies so
<br>
<em>&gt; far has been an almost total miscomprehension of the basic reason why I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested the environment. And this is not entirely my fault, because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have looked back over my writing and I see that the information was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly stated in the posts. I suspect that many people have too little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to do more than skim-read the posts on this list, and as a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they get incredibly superficial ideas about what was said.
</em><br>
<p><p>No, that's not the reason. The fault is the inadequacy of the language. You
<br>
may have clearly stated your points by _your_ understanding of the terms you
<br>
used, but that doesn't communicate them to anyone else. Think about it:
<br>
Michael Wilson had basically the same complaint with you as you have with
<br>
him; were you just skim-reading his posts? You could say he's being stupid
<br>
or ignorant, but he's a pretty sharp guy and there aren't a lot of people in
<br>
the world who know more about this stuff than he does; and I will immodestly
<br>
claim the same description applies to me; and neither of us really
<br>
understand what you're getting at. I will suggest you should at least
<br>
acknowledge the plausibility of the hypothesis that the problem is that the
<br>
language just isn't up to the job.
<br>
<p>I am going to split this message at this point, because I am getting
<br>
<em>&gt; close to the end of my tether.
</em><br>
<p><p>Sorry to hear that, but I'll observe that most of what you've been doing so
<br>
far is arguing with the SIAI guys in a debate where both sides are just
<br>
talking past each other due to the inadequacy of the language used. I don't
<br>
think that reflects on the chances of success using a different approach.
<br>
<p>For anyone who reads the below explanation and still finds no spark of
<br>
<em>&gt; understanding, I say this: go do some reading. Read enough about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world of complex systems to have a good solid background, then come back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see if this makes sense. Either that, or go visit with the folks at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Santa Fe, or bring those folks in on the discussion. I am really not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to beat my head against this any more.
</em><br>
<p><p>Did that, years ago, everything from popular science writing to a big stack
<br>
of Santa Fe's technical papers. Was fun bedtime reading, but not a great
<br>
deal of concrete relevance to AGI.
<br>
<p>First, I need to ask you to accept one hypothetical... you're going to
<br>
<em>&gt; have to work with me here and not argue against this point, just accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as a &quot;what if&quot;. Agreed?
</em><br>
<p><p>Sure.
<br>
<p>Here is the hypothetical. Imagine that cognitive systems consist of a
<br>
<em>&gt; large number of &quot;elements&quot; which are the atoms of knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation (an element represents a thing in the world, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;thing&quot; can be concrete or abstract, a noun-like thing or an action or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process .... anything whatsoever).
</em><br>
<p><p>And here was me thinking intelligence was based on an indivisible, ineffable
<br>
soul :)
<br>
<p>Seriously, this is the sort of thing I mean. Everyone agrees that of course
<br>
cognitive systems must consist of a large number of elements - what else
<br>
could they be? (At least everyone on SL4; I doubt anyone who believes in the
<br>
ineffability of the soul will have bothered to read this far.)
<br>
<p>Presumably you mean something more than just that, of course, but this is
<br>
where we need details.
<br>
<p>Elements are simple computational
<br>
<em>&gt; structures, we will suppose. They may have a bit of machinery inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them (i.e. they are not passive data structures, they are active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities), and they have connections to other elements (a variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different kinds of connections, including transient and long-term). For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most part, all elements have the same kind of structure and code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside them, but different data (so, to a first approximation, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; element is not an arbitrary piece of code, like an Actor, but more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an elaborate form of connectionist &quot;unit&quot;).
</em><br>
<p><p>Okay. Connectionism typically uses a few simple equations with large vectors
<br>
of floating point coefficients, plus an optimized hill climbing algorithm to
<br>
tweak the coefficients for a training data set. What do you propose to use
<br>
instead?
<br>
<p>The most important aspect of an element's life is its history. When it
<br>
<em>&gt; first comes into being, its purpose is to capture a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regularity (the co-occurence of some other elements, perhaps), and from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then on it refines itself so as to capture more precisely the pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it has made its own. So, when I first encounter a dog, I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build an element that represents &quot;frisky thing with tail that barks and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tries to jump on me&quot;, and then as my experience progresses, this concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (aka element) gets refined in all the obvious ways and becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sophisticated enough for me to have a full blown taxonomy of all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different types of dogs.
</em><br>
<p><p>How? Forget the me-vs-them business, this is what it comes down to: _how_
<br>
exactly would your proposed architecture accomplish the above?
