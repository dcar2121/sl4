</em><br>
<p>This view is personal philosophy, not science; you've started with the
<br>
(implicit) premise that 'people' are unique and consciousness must be
<br>
continuous somehow...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The laws of physics that give rise to the fields neurons and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; microtubules operate under, would have to be reproduced as well for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading to copy personal identity. 
</em><br>
<p>...and then looked for a way to justify that in terms of physics. Many
<br>
others, me included, take the view that consciousness need not be
<br>
continuous and when you copy someone, you create two beings that are
<br>
equally the 'original' person, and then proceed to diverge. People go
<br>
to silly lengths trying to prop up the 'single stream of consciousness'
<br>
view; 'it's not me unless the're a continuous stream of time-space
<br>
co-ordinates... it's not me unless quantum states of microfibres are
<br>
preserved... the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanisms is
<br>
impossible because the human soul is divisible...' but they are
<br>
essentially trying to find justification for an ungrounded human
<br>
intuition (and sometimes superstition) in physics, with all the usual
<br>
bad results of searching for justifications for a preexisting premise.
<br>
<p>The real universe doesn't have indivisible souls, it has intelligent
<br>
systems which have differing degrees of similarity, and self-models
<br>
which include the simplifying assumption of continuous experience and
<br>
consciousness. When thinking about things like copying and uploading,
<br>
I'd say the important thing to think about is the frequency
<br>
distribution over experiences that you-like intelligences have; this
<br>
is the only view that survives a radically materialist perspective.
<br>
That isn't to say that various sorts of continuity aren't necessarily
<br>
important from a subjective point of view, though I don't think we
<br>
know enough to say which ones and how yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would take this further: uploading is too hard post-singularity;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieving it would require enacting new laws of physics.
</em><br>
<p>You appear to be referring to absolutely perfect flash-uploading,
<br>
which is indeed impossible (as far as we know). Personally I suspect
<br>
there could be quite a lot of low-level imperfection in the process
<br>
with no noticable objective or subjective effect; the human brain is
<br>
accomadating in that respect. But if you /are/ worried about absolute
<br>
continuity, I suggest you forget 'scan-and-simulate' type uploading
<br>
and google 'Moravec transfer'; the first result that comes up is
<br>
actually a previous post to this mailing list (Eliezer summarised
<br>
it quite well in 'Staring into the Singularity', in 1996). I'm not
<br>
aware of any physical or (sensible) philosophical objections to this
<br>
process, which simply requires mature nanotechnology and brain science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uploading = being god, and discussion of it doesn't belong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alongside other mind/intelligence singularity hybrids.
</em><br>
<p>I'm unclear where you get this from, unless you mean the supposed
<br>
need to create physically perfect copies. Being uploaded doesn't
<br>
automatically give you any exceptional powers, it merely introduces
<br>
the potential for them.
