|&gt; As far as computer intelligence goes, it appears to me you are
<br>
|&gt; drastically underestimating the impact. (Yes, the rabbit hole
<br>
|&gt; goes much  much deeper, in fact- its something of black hole, or
<br>
|&gt; ... *cough*  Singularity... hehe).

<br>
| Well let's not get into a fight over who can be most awed by the
<br>
| incomprehensibility of the Singularity.  There's no winner to that
<br>
|  conversation; it descends instantly into madness.  For instance,
<br>
| we can  readily assume that over the next decade or two we will
<br>

<br>

<br>
| pleasure and pain responses.   Therefore the question &quot;what will
<br>
| posthumans do with these amazing powers&quot;  can only reasonably be
<br>

<br>
| no sense to it.
<br>
<p>The male version, of course, may be operated using a hand crank.
<br>
<p>I was just struck by a relationship between the ideas about reward and
<br>
motivation, and Heidegger's idea of &quot;thrown-ness&quot;. Now, while I think
<br>
that Heidegger is a big booby-head, some of his sentences are very
<br>
thought-provoking. In one of his more lucid moments, he talks about
<br>
how Dasein (read human minds) is thrown into the world. We can't
<br>
simply change our state of being in the world through a simple force
<br>
of will -- we need to learn about what affects us, how it does so,
<br>
learn the rules by which our brains operate. Of course, us mere humans
<br>
only ever learn some rough approximations of our own behaviour /
<br>
mental function rules.
<br>
<p>The suggestion of most Singularists is that a sufficiently advanced
<br>
intelligence *would* understand its own mind, and *would* be able to
<br>
modify its state of being in the world, without having to learn its
<br>
own behavioural rules.
<br>
<p>I am yet to be convinced that all possible super-intelligences will
<br>
also have the property of being able to change their mental states in
<br>
this way. I don't *think* it's clear from the literature, but not
<br>
having read every book ever written, I don't know what I don't know.
<br>
What are people's opinion about the relationship of
<br>
&quot;superintelligence&quot; and being &quot;thrown into the world&quot;?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
