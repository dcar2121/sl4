<p>Sigh!
<br>
<p>All this (including the rest of your message, which I have omitted) is
<br>
predicated on a misunderstanding of the point I am trying to make.  I
<br>
cannot count the number of times this has happened just in the last couple
<br>
of messages from you. This happened last time I raised issues of this sort,
<br>
and it is happening again, so here is the point, stated as bluntly as I can:
<br>
<p>There is a REASON why one should build a reasonably complete system,
<br>
watching the learning mechanisms *really* build concepts (and not rely on
<br>
you the programmer to insert them) and watching the recognition system
<br>
*really* figure out the relationship between sensory patterns and
<br>
recognized internal concepts (rather than have you assume that this can be
<br>
done later..... and that REASON is that we (CAS-inspired cognitive science
<br>
people) have substantial empirical data that says that if you invent your
<br>
local mechanisms and don't test them in the above way, those mechanisms may
<br>
simply not EVER work, no matter how much fiddling you do with them.  Until
<br>
you understand how that could be so, and that that is the reason for my
<br>
proposal, your other comments are just interesting starting points for
<br>
debates on unrelated issues.
