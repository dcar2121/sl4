</em><br>
<p>Everyone wants to see a draft specification.  Under other circumstances 
<br>
this might be understandable, but if nobody understands my *reason* for 
<br>
suggesting the type of development environment that I outlined, then it 
<br>
would be a waste of time for me to lay out the spec, because it would be 
<br>
judged against all the wrong criteria.  And if, on the other hand, 
<br>
people did completely get the motivation for the environment, then the 
<br>
details would be much less important.
<br>
<p>I am distressed, because the common thread through all the replies so 
<br>
far has been an almost total miscomprehension of the basic reason why I 
<br>
suggested the environment.  And this is not entirely my fault, because I 
<br>
have looked back over my writing and I see that the information was 
<br>
clearly stated in the posts.  I suspect that many people have too little 
<br>
time to do more than skim-read the posts on this list, and as a result 
<br>
they get incredibly superficial ideas about what was said.
<br>
<p>I am going to split this message at this point, because I am getting 
<br>
close to the end of my tether.
<br>
<p>For anyone who reads the below explanation and still finds no spark of 
<br>
understanding, I say this:  go do some reading.  Read enough about the 
<br>
world of complex systems to have a good solid background, then come back 
<br>
and see if this makes sense.  Either that, or go visit with the folks at 
<br>
Santa Fe, or bring those folks in on the discussion.  I am really not 
<br>
going to beat my head against this any more.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>I will try a different way to illustrate the underlying reasoning.
<br>
<p>First, I need to ask you to accept one hypothetical... you're going to 
<br>
have to work with me here and not argue against this point, just accept 
<br>
it as a &quot;what if&quot;.  Agreed?
<br>
<p>Here is the hypothetical.  Imagine that cognitive systems consist of a 
<br>
large number of &quot;elements&quot; which are the atoms of knowledge 
<br>
representation (an element represents a thing in the world, but that 
<br>
&quot;thing&quot; can be concrete or abstract, a noun-like thing or an action or 
<br>
process .... anything whatsoever).  Elements are simple computational 
<br>
structures, we will suppose.  They may have a bit of machinery inside 
<br>
them (i.e. they are not passive data structures, they are active 
<br>
entities), and they have connections to other elements (a variety of 
<br>
different kinds of connections, including transient and long-term).  For 
<br>
the most part, all elements have the same kind of structure and code 
<br>
inside them, but different data (so, to a first approximation, an 
<br>
element is not an arbitrary piece of code, like an Actor, but more like 
<br>
an elaborate form of connectionist &quot;unit&quot;).
<br>
<p>The most important aspect of an element's life is its history.  When it 
<br>
first comes into being, its purpose is to capture a particular 
<br>
regularity (the co-occurence of some other elements, perhaps), and from 
<br>
then on it refines itself so as to capture more precisely the pattern 
<br>
that it has made its own.  So, when I first encounter a dog, I might 
<br>
build an element that represents &quot;frisky thing with tail that barks and 
<br>
tries to jump on me&quot;, and then as my experience progresses, this concept 
<br>
(aka element) gets refined in all the obvious ways and becomes 
<br>
sophisticated enough for me to have a full blown taxonomy of all the 
<br>
different types of dogs.
<br>
<p>Notice one important thing:  the specific form of the final dog-element 
<br>
is a result of (a) a basic design for the general form of all elements, 
<br>
and (b) the learning mechanisms that caused the dog-element to grow into 
<br>
the adult form, as a result of experience.
<br>
<p>Now, moving on from this set of basic assumptions, let's consider what 
<br>
might happen if someone (a cognitive scientist) were to try to figure 
<br>
out how this cognitive system works, given very poor access to its 
<br>
functioning.
<br>
<p>The scientist might start out by declaring that they have an idea for 
<br>
the format of the adult elements, derived from various ideas about what 
<br>
ideas and concepts are, and how they relate to one another.  What is 
<br>
more, the scientist might discover that they can do quite well at first: 
<br>
they can write out some supposed adult elements (including both the 
<br>
presumed form, and the specific content), specify how they interact with 
<br>
each other, and show that IF they give the system that innate knowledge, 
<br>
they can get the system to show a certain amount of intelligent behavior.
<br>
<p>But now along comes a complex systems theorist to spoil the party.  The 
<br>
CST says &quot;This looks good, but in a real system those adult elements 
<br>
would have developed as a result of the learning mechanisms interacting 
<br>
with the real world, right?  And the system would recognise real-world 
<br>
patterns as a result of the recognition mechanisms (which also got 
<br>
developed as a result of experience) operating on raw sensory input, right?&quot;
<br>
<p>The cognitive scientist agrees, and says that the learning mechanisms 
<br>
are a tough issue, and will be dealt with later.
<br>
<p>But now the complex systems theorist looks a little concerned, and says 
<br>
&quot;I understand that there is a distinction between the structure (the 
<br>
basic design) of the elements and their specific content, and I do 
<br>
understand that while the content changes during development, the 
<br>
structure of the elements does not.... but having said that, doesn't the 
<br>
element structure (as well as the structure of the &quot;thinking&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;reasoning&quot; mechanisms) have to be chosen to fit the learning 
<br>
mechanisms, not the other way around?&quot;
<br>
<p>And the cognitive scientists replies that, no, there is no reason to do 
<br>
that:  we can easily study the knowledge representation and thinking and 
<br>
reasoning mechanisms first, then later on develop appropriate learning 
<br>
mechanisms that produce the content that goes inside that stuff.
<br>
<p>But now the complex systems theorist is really worried.  &quot;Hang on:  if 
<br>
you build learning mechanisms with the kind of power you are talking 
<br>
about (with all that interaction and so on), you are going to be 
<br>
creating the Mother of all complex systems.  And what that means is, to 
<br>
get your learning systems to actually work and stably generate the right 
<br>
content, you will eventually have to change the design of the elements. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Because all our experience with complex systems indicates that if 
<br>
you start by looking at the final adult form of a system of interacting 
<br>
units like that, and then try to design a set of local mechanisms 
<br>
(equivalent to your learning mechanisms in this case) which could 
<br>
generate that particular adult content, you would get absolutely 
<br>
nowhere.  So in other words, by the time you have finished the learning 
<br>
mechanisms you will have completely thrown away your initial presupposed 
<br>
design for the structure and content of the adult elements.  So why 
<br>
waste time working on the specific format of the element-structure now? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You would be better off looking for the kinds of learning mechanisms 
<br>
that might generate *anything* stable, never mind this presupposed 
<br>
structure you have already set your heart on.&quot;
<br>
<p>And that's where I come in.
<br>
<p>The development environment I suggested would be a way to do things in 
<br>
that (to some people) &quot;backwards&quot; way.  It addresses that need, as 
<br>
expressed by my hypothetical complex systems theorist, to look at what 
<br>
happens when different kinds of learning mechanisms are allowed to 
<br>
generate adult systems.  And it would not, as some people have 
<br>
insultingly claimed, be just a matter of doing some kind of random 
<br>
search through the space of all possible cognitive systems ... nothing 
<br>
so crude.
<br>
<p>You can dispute that the above characterization of cognitive systems is 
<br>
correct.  All power to you if you do:  you will never get what I am 
<br>
trying to say here, and there would be no point me talking about the 
<br>
structure of the development environment.
<br>
<p>I rest my case.
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.
