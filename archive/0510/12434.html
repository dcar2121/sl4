<p>
This reply is primarily directed at HC and Ben Goertzel, who have given
<br>
two of the most insightful responses to what I wrote.
<br>
<p>I won't quote your specific posts back at you, because I am trying not
<br>
to pollute the discussion with too many n-th order quotes. Instead, I
<br>
have read what you say and I will try to reply to the spirit of it.
<br>
<p>There are a couple of subtle traps that we are falling into
<br>
sometimes when we talk about the relevance of &quot;complex systems&quot; to AGI
<br>
design. The second brings us right to the heart of the issue; the first
<br>
is easier, so I'll deal with that first.
<br>
<p>The first trap is to think that I am advocating something at the
<br>
level of using specific mathematics, or known CAS systems, or accepted
<br>
CAS theories (such as they are) to be the new basis of AGI research.
<br>
Not at all: I am merely taking a fairly simple result, applying it to
<br>
cognitive systems, and coming to a conclusion about strategy. Then I'm
<br>
outa there: bye bye Santa Fe, back to work.
<br>
<p>The second trap is much harder to state, but I'll try. It involves a
<br>
distinction between three things that I might be saying, only one of
<br>
which is true:
<br>
<p>(1) Am I saying that the thinking and reasoning mechanisms (the ones
<br>
to be found in an adult system) are acting as a complex system on a
<br>
moment by moment basis? In other words, if we could look at the local,
<br>
low-level functioning of those mechanisms would we find a complex
<br>
systems disconnect between that level and (global) thinking and
<br>
reasoning behavior? NO! I am not saying that. I think this is
<br>
possible, but that is not my claim at the moment: Iam neutral about
<br>
this issue.
<br>
<p>(2) Am I saying .... exactly ditto, but about the learning
<br>
mechanisms (the things that build new concepts as a result of
<br>
experience)? If we looked at the concept-building mechanisms, would we
<br>
find that we could not relate local to global? Again: NO! I am not
<br>
saying that; I am neutral about that also.
<br>
<p>(3) What I am trying to talk about is the way that the learning
<br>
mechanisms interact with a real world environment over the course of the
<br>
system's lifetime learning, generating all the knowledge that the
<br>
system has as an adult. This is a long-term process, and the outcome,
<br>
the end result of this process is going to be governed by the cumulative
<br>
result of some very CAS-like mechanisms (the learning mechanisms)
<br>
interacting with the world. Here is where I find the trouble. This
<br>
process, considered as a system, contains at least the possibility of a
<br>
complex-systems-like disconnect between local mechanisms (the learning
<br>
mechanisms proper) and global behavior (the knowledge generated by the
<br>
mechanisms, by the time system gets to be an adult). It is not a matter
<br>
of moment by moment disconnect, it is a lifetime disconnect.
<br>
<p>To illustrate with an example of what might happen: you could insert
<br>
your chosen learning mechanisms, let them interact with the world, and
<br>
then be surprised at the end of the day to find that, say, the system
<br>
just never managed to get certain kinds of abstraction; and when you
<br>
tried to figure out why this was happening, there might be nothing
<br>
local that you could put your finger on. You would simply be getting
<br>
something wrong at the end of the process, but because it was a result
<br>
of a long-term interaction (i.e. a complex system effect), you might not
<br>
be able to attack it directly.
<br>
<p>Now, in one sense all I want to do is get people to discuss this latter
<br>
possibility. Just the possibility! I want someone to acknowledge that
<br>
this might turn out to the way things happen. We might not have
<br>
seriously run up against the problem yet, because enobody has subjected
<br>
their AGI model to the test of getting it to build almost all of its
<br>
knowledge using just the combination of learning mechanisms and messy
<br>
real-world experience. Is that not also agreed? That no one has really
<br>
done an end-to-end test of a real, non-toy, general knowledge- 
<br>
acquisition mechanism yet?
<br>
<p>And if this is true (that nobody has done such a test yet), is it not
<br>
true that if my hypothesis is true, the only way we might to start to
<br>
really notice the effect is after we had done a few long-term learning
<br>
runs and noticed that the learning mechanisms were simply not working?
<br>
<p>You might say: why expect trouble when we have no reason to believe
<br>
that there will be trouble. My response has been: if the learning 
<br>
mechanisms have the characteristics we generally think of them as 
<br>
having, and if as a result they look like they will display the usual 
<br>
complex systems disconnect between local and global, the experience of 
<br>
the complex systems community is that it would be truly astonishing if 
<br>
we did not have trouble.
<br>
<p>Finally, I am using this argument as a reason to adopt a new research 
<br>
*paradigm* (exemplified by my suggested development environment and 
<br>
methodology), not a particular *model of cognition*.  I was very clear 
<br>
about this, but a number of people have persistently and viciously 
<br>
slammed my words because they say the model [sic] I have proposed is 
<br>
stupidly vague.  There was never any such model.
<br>
<p><p>I think this is the clearest I have managed to state the argument.
<br>
<p>I might add that anyone who advances a thesis in this kind of forum is 
<br>
always caught between a rock and a hard place:  if I am brief, my 
<br>
wording is so concise that it lends itself nicely to misinterpretation 
<br>
by people who take one paragraph at a time and criticise out of context; 
<br>
but if I give a long, detailed account I am accused of being 
<br>
long-winded.  Damned if I do, damned if I don't.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
