<em>&gt; &gt; But, one can still let the detailed representations evolve and adapt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (and emerge ;) within the &quot;environmental constraints&quot; one has explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wired in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Done correctly, that would be the actual valid use of 'emergence' in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI. But you'd never want to use something this fuzzy and subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a design goal or basic principle. You don't set out saying 'we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to build an AGI using emergence!'; you design an AGI using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best mechanisms you can find to achieve specific effects, such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they work together to produce all the key aspects of intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then when you finally get to summarising all that complexity for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the press release then you /might/ be justified in saying 'ah, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually works by letting Xs emerge in the context of Y...'.
</em><br>
<p>Well, &quot;emergence&quot; is a very general term which always conceals all the
<br>
particularities of the situation.
<br>
<p>For instance, in immunology one can say that the overall immune response
<br>
is an emergent phenomenon, because
<br>
<p>-- it arises from the &quot;immune network&quot;
<br>
of interactions between antibody classes via &quot;self-organization&quot; rather
<br>
than via the imposition of some sort of top-down structure.
<br>
<p>-- it is not obvious from the properties of the individual antibody
<br>
classes taken in isolation
<br>
<p>However, this doesn't mean that one could design an effective immune
<br>
system merely by taking a random bunch of antibody-like thingies and
<br>
throwing them together and hoping the right networks will come out
<br>
of it.  In fact some Los Alamos and SFI folks have played with this
<br>
approach (Alan Perelson, Rob deBoer for instance) and have managed
<br>
to replicate some of the overall properties of real immune networks,
<br>
but not others.  A lot of the properties of real immune networks
<br>
seem to come down to T-cells which are not understood all that well
<br>
and tend not to be adequately accounted for in the LANL/SFI
<br>
computer simulations (last I checked).
<br>
<p>So, yeah, there is always a detailed story underlying any observed
<br>
instance of &quot;emergence&quot;, and if one wants to engineer a system with
<br>
certain emergent behaviors, one needs to understand specifically
<br>
WHY the particular type of emergent behavior one wants is likely
<br>
to emerge from the particular system one is building.  One doesn't
<br>
need to understand in detail how each particular instance of
<br>
emergent behavior will be produced, but probably one has to
<br>
understand things well enough to explain in detail (if
<br>
laboriously) how SOME particular examples  of the emergent
<br>
behavior will be produced.
<br>
<p>For instance, in the immune network example, I would expect that
<br>
in the case of an adequate immune network simulation, there would
<br>
be a conceptual and mathematical explanation of why a particular
<br>
choice of computational T-cell/B-cell model is expected to give
<br>
rise to particular aspects of real immune response.
<br>
<p>Getting back to AI, in Novamente one aspect of knowledge
<br>
representation involves what we call &quot;maps&quot; -- fuzzy sets of
<br>
nodes/links that tend to be activated together.  These maps
<br>
are not programmed explicitly -- they emerge.  But the capability
<br>
for such maps to emerge is not there by accident, it's there
<br>
by design.  And I could explain for you in detail the processes
<br>
by which an example map (say the map for the concept &quot;block&quot;
<br>
meaning blocks observed in the AGI-SIM simulation world) would
<br>
arise.  But doing such a detailed explanation for any one concept
<br>
is a LOT of work so it wouldn't be feasible to do that for every
<br>
map in the system.
<br>
<p>What gives map formation the flavor of &quot;emergence&quot; is that there
<br>
is no MapFormation MindAgent (to lapse into Novamente lingo), i.e.
<br>
no block of code that explicitly produces maps.  Rather, map
<br>
formation occurs as an indirect consequence of the &quot;localized&quot;
<br>
activity of a bunch of processes that act on individual nodes and
<br>
links, that then coordinate together to cause maps to &quot;self-
<br>
organize.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I didn't say &quot;complex systems theory&quot; btw I said &quot;complex systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking.&quot; This is because there isn't really any general &quot;complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; systems theory&quot; out there....  there are theories of particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classes of complex systems, and then there is mathematical theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relevant to complex systems (e.g. dynamical systems theory) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then there is complex systems *philosophy* (which I do find useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for guiding my thinking in many cases)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, important distinction, though at this point I'd say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding 'complex systems philosophy' is primarily useful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of recognising and avoiding unwanted dynamics and failure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modes in AGI/FAI.
</em><br>
<p>The concepts of &quot;attractor&quot; and &quot;attractor basin&quot; have been useful
<br>
in Novamente design.  Maps as alluded to above are roughly speaking
<br>
&quot;lobes&quot; in strange attractors of Novamente dynamics.
