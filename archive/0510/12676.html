<em>&gt; 'Flash' uploading, involving scanning the brain and copying the data to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a computer, and Moravec transfer, involving replacing individual neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with functional equivalents, are not the only possibilities.
</em><br>
<p><p>There is another possibility, which I first read about in a Greg Egan sci-fi
<br>
story, _Closer_, and which I think would deal with all the issues brought
<br>
up.
<br>
<p>The idea is that, as it has been claimed, the brain is a dynamic machine,
<br>
and recording static information might not suffice. So instead of
<br>
deep-scanning a neuron and replacing it with a mechanical component, a
<br>
neuron is &quot;isolated&quot; and studied by a system that transparently keeps it
<br>
connected to the rest of the brain while it studies the way it reacts to
<br>
inputs. After a while, considering the knowledge we would have at the time
<br>
of the internal structure of the neuron, we could build a dynamic model of
<br>
the neuron, and replace it with a mechanical sync'ed component that keeps
<br>
dynamic state. The way to do this proposed in the book is by non-invasively
<br>
carrying forward this process while writing the dynamic model on a computer
<br>
substrate, and after the model is complete and has been compared to the
<br>
biological original for a while in order to ensure that there are no errors,
<br>
the biological components are discarded altogether.
<br>
<p>This would deal with the dynamicity issues mentioned above, as well as the
<br>
matter of so-called pressence, since the dynamic state of the mechanical
<br>
substrate would share all the structure and causal links with the biological
<br>
substrate.
<br>
