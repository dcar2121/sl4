<p><em>&gt; Remember what uploading would involve.  You probably have to know the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the synaptic buttons, in three dimensions, in circumstances where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the darn things are not broadcasting much EM but hiding most of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals in chemical waves.
</em><br>
<p>You may not need single-neuron resolution, since most neural pathways
<br>
are columns of dozens or hundreds of redundant neurons firing in
<br>
synchrony.  Since postsynaptic responses operate probabilistically,
<br>
this ensures signal propagation and separates signal from noise. 
<br>
Tononi et al. suggest this  (see below).  Understanding how
<br>
computation occurs during signal integration at the dendrites may be
<br>
interesting and useful, but probably not crucial.  Brain damage from
<br>
mechanical or chemical insult demonstrates that the specific
<br>
synapse-level organization of the brain can change dramatically while
<br>
retaining the original function.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anyone out there on the SL4 list have to hand the spatial and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporal resolution of the best of the fMRI systems?  Anyone care to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a quick scale comparison with a synaptic button and an action potential?
</em><br>
<p>You can get less than 1 mm^3 voxels for a single scan (it's actually
<br>
considered to be a 2D scan with a set thickness), or a short series of
<br>
scans, although much lower resolutions are used for large sequences
<br>
over time.  1 mm^3 is about 1000 neurons.  But fMRI only measures one
<br>
variable, usually &quot;overall activity&quot; taken from oxygen or glucose
<br>
metabolism.  What you really need is the ability to measure all the
<br>
neuromodulators that a neuron(s) can produce and how it uses them. 
<br>
Current technology is woefully insufficient at constructing the kind
<br>
of brain sim that we want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only good argument against this is that we might not need the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution.  But at the moment we are clueless about the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional significance of the detailed structure.  For example, maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spike synchrony in the dendritic tree is crucial at the functional level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... and if it is crucial, then getting a brain approximately right but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the fine details a bit fuzzy would be about as valuable as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading two fistfuls of porridge.
</em><br>
<p>Tononi has proposed creating a connection matrix at &quot;mesoscale&quot;
<br>
resolution (minicolumns of neurons being the basic functional units of
<br>
the brain).

<br>
<p>Even with adequate funding, we're at least 10-15 years away from a
<br>
useful connectome database.
