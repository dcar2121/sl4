<em>&gt;&gt;Presumably you mean something more than just that, of course, but this is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;where we need details.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;       Elements are simple computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     structures, we will suppose.  They may have a bit of machinery inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     them (i.e. they are not passive data structures, they are active
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     entities), and they have connections to other elements (a variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     different kinds of connections, including transient and long-term).  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     the most part, all elements have the same kind of structure and code
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     inside them, but different data (so, to a first approximation, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     element is not an arbitrary piece of code, like an Actor, but more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     an elaborate form of connectionist &quot;unit&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Okay. Connectionism typically uses a few simple equations with large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;vectors of floating point coefficients, plus an optimized hill climbing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;algorithm to tweak the coefficients for a training data set. What do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;propose to use instead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     The most important aspect of an element's life is its history.  When it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     first comes into being, its purpose is to capture a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     regularity (the co-occurence of some other elements, perhaps), and from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     then on it refines itself so as to capture more precisely the pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     that it has made its own.  So, when I first encounter a dog, I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     build an element that represents &quot;frisky thing with tail that barks and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     tries to jump on me&quot;, and then as my experience progresses, this concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     (aka element) gets refined in all the obvious ways and becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     sophisticated enough for me to have a full blown taxonomy of all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     different types of dogs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;How? Forget the me-vs-them business, this is what it comes down to: _how_ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;exactly would your proposed architecture accomplish the above?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;- Russell
</em><br>
<p>When in doubt, look in the back of the book at the answers.
<br>
<p>Brain look like they do this at two levels, cells and cortical 
<br>
columns.  The second level might be just to make up for the unreliable 
<br>
nature of single nerve cells.  So, what does one of these columns do?  How 
<br>
does it talk to others?  And how does it learn?  Can any of this be mapped 
<br>
into hardware/software?  Are these even the right questions?
