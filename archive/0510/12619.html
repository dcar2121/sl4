</em><br>
<p>Your use of the word 'explicit' conceals a very interesting and relevant
<br>
area; the use of indirect yet still reliable constraints on the basis
<br>
and organisation of AI-generated cognitive content.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For instance, we haven't gotten this far yet, but in principle one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give Novamente hard-coded specifications regarding &quot;what a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation of Friendliness should be like&quot;, and then let it learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the detailed representation (and change the detailed representation over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time as it learns and grows...).
</em><br>
<p>I agree that filling in representational detail without causing referent
<br>
drift is highly desireable in principle (as I understand it, essential
<br>
for Yudkowsky style FAI), and difficult in practice. Indeed, testing a
<br>
candidate solution to this problem is a major goal of the implementation
<br>
project I am currently engaged in, though from past conversations I get
<br>
the impression that this solution differs significantly from your approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In order to take this approach one needs to do what Loosemore doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want, which is to specify aspects of the nature of the AI's knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation scheme up front.
</em><br>
<p>Again, a single word ('aspects') represents the tip of a complicated
<br>
and subtle iceberg :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, one can still let the detailed representations evolve and adapt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and emerge ;) within the &quot;environmental constraints&quot; one has explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wired in.
</em><br>
<p>Done correctly, that would be the actual valid use of 'emergence' in
<br>
AGI. But you'd never want to use something this fuzzy and subjective
<br>
as a design goal or basic principle. You don't set out saying 'we're
<br>
going to build an AGI using emergence!'; you design an AGI using the
<br>
best mechanisms you can find to achieve specific effects, such that
<br>
they work together to produce all the key aspects of intelligence,
<br>
and then when you finally get to summarising all that complexity for
<br>
the press release then you /might/ be justified in saying 'ah, this
<br>
actually works by letting Xs emerge in the context of Y...'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is just one more way in which the reality of AGI design is a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtler than the simple distinctions Loosemore seems to be drawing...
</em><br>
<p>He does appear to have a counterproductive us-versus-them mystique
<br>
going on. Once again, this is not uncommon in academic or
<br>
'non-mainstream' AGI, and indeed the SIAI needs to be careful about
<br>
avoiding this attitude with regard to FAI theory.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I didn't say &quot;complex systems theory&quot; btw I said &quot;complex systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking.&quot; This is because there isn't really any general &quot;complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems theory&quot; out there....  there are theories of particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classes of complex systems, and then there is mathematical theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to complex systems (e.g. dynamical systems theory) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then there is complex systems *philosophy* (which I do find useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for guiding my thinking in many cases)
</em><br>
<p>Ok, important distinction, though at this point I'd say that
<br>
understanding 'complex systems philosophy' is primarily useful in
<br>
terms of recognising and avoiding unwanted dynamics and failure
<br>
modes in AGI/FAI.
