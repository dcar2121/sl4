<em>&gt;|&gt; As far as computer intelligence goes, it appears to me you are

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;|&gt; ... *cough*  Singularity... hehe).

<em>&gt;| Well let's not get into a fight over who can be most awed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| incomprehensibility of the Singularity.  There's no winner to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;|  conversation; it descends instantly into madness.  For instance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| we can  readily assume that over the next decade or two we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| invent The Orgasm  Button (prototypes, for women only alas, are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| already in use) and generally  otherwise intimately control our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| pleasure and pain responses.   Therefore the question &quot;what will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| posthumans do with these amazing powers&quot;  can only reasonably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| answered &quot;why, whatever they program themselves to  do.&quot;  There's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;| no sense to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The male version, of course, may be operated using a hand crank.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I was just struck by a relationship between the ideas about reward and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motivation, and Heidegger's idea of &quot;thrown-ness&quot;. Now, while I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that Heidegger is a big booby-head, some of his sentences are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought-provoking. In one of his more lucid moments, he talks about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how Dasein (read human minds) is thrown into the world. We can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply change our state of being in the world through a simple force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of will -- we need to learn about what affects us, how it does so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;learn the rules by which our brains operate. Of course, us mere humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only ever learn some rough approximations of our own behaviour /
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mental function rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The suggestion of most Singularists is that a sufficiently advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intelligence *would* understand its own mind, and *would* be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modify its state of being in the world, without having to learn its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own behavioural rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am yet to be convinced that all possible super-intelligences will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also have the property of being able to change their mental states in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this way. I don't *think* it's clear from the literature, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having read every book ever written, I don't know what I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What are people's opinion about the relationship of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;superintelligence&quot; and being &quot;thrown into the world&quot;?
</em><br>
<p><p>I think there is a very good chance we will be destroyed by the first super 
<br>
intelligence thrown into the world, unless we can make some drastic changes. 
<br>
First of all, there needs to exist a broad, but tight community of AGI 
<br>
researches who are working *together* (and thus can trust each other not to 
<br>
go spawn a singularity on their own). The community is also going to also 
<br>
necessarily require a lot of resources (even if it's not a physical 
<br>
community, people need money to live). The constiutents of the community 
<br>
must also be free of any money-making requirements, and free from any 
<br>
pressure of &quot;results&quot; - other than the pressure innate in the problem. Some 
<br>
in the community may need to hire programming teams to help them on their 
<br>
particular experiment/design, and may need to purchanse higher end computer 
<br>
equipment to effectively test their programs. Communication and LEARNING are 
<br>
essential features this community must have. The problem of AI isn't 
<br>
something a group of people specializing in different areas can get together 
<br>
and make happen by fiddling with a computer programming language. Each 
<br>
person has to individually understand each specialty and how they relate to 
<br>
others, and this is, I predict, essential to any chance of success. Another 
<br>
major point is that the community has to agree to certain standards. First 
<br>
of all, that Friendliness is not just a necessary requirement of AI, but the 
<br>
foundational structure inherent in the AI. Secondly, they must all agree 
<br>
that any chance of take-off needs to be handled with extreme care and 
<br>
deliberation- between all parts of the community.
<br>
<p>To the best of my understanding, this is EXACTLY the type of community the 
<br>
Singuarity Institute is attempting to create- someone correct me (or specify 
<br>
for me) if I am mistaken.
