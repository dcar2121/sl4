I think the point is that more recently formed stars have higher
<br>
metallicity. In past generations of stars, metallicity was lower. The
<br>
first generation of stars would have had almost zero metallicity.
<br>
BTW, Millions of years is the wrong timescale for stars. Except maybe
<br>
really, really massive ones.
<br>
<p>You probably need several (at least two, maybe three) generations of
<br>
stars to get enough heavy elements to make rocky planets, so more
<br>
recently-formed stars will have a better chance of hosting life (as we
<br>
know it. Gregory Benford seems keen on the idea of lifeforms based on
<br>
magnetic fields and plasma, but that's a whole different story, and i
<br>
don't know whether he regards that as a real possibility or just a good
<br>
story line).
<br>
<p>So, no, younger stars have not always been more likely to have planets.
<br>
Just more recent ones. Our sun is likely to be a third-generation star,
<br>
AFAIK.
<br>
<p>The very first stars could only have had gas planets, if any (i wonder
<br>
if they might have had lithium cores??).
