<p>This issue is a complicated one; you can't divide the positions various
<br>
people take into a dichotomy or even a single linear spectrum. Sticking
<br>
to the physical details, some people think hardware is essential, some
<br>
people think VR is ok as long as low-level sensing is simulated, some
<br>
people think it's ok to bypass some low-level visual processing but
<br>
not higher level stuff, some take the position that as long as spatial
<br>
modelling is done it's ok to feed in abstract geometric objects with
<br>
property tags, some think that ((red ball) at (3, 2)) is an acceptable
<br>
form of sensory input as long as there is an interactive environment
<br>
simulation separate from the AI itself, and finally there are people
<br>
trying to develop truly 'disembodied' AI that crunches data in abstract.
<br>
<p>There is debate about the criticality of human interaction, the
<br>
importance of natural language and the usefulness of AI-AI interaction.
<br>
I would advocate discussing the issue at a more abstract level, talking
<br>
about the qualities present in the AI's input and output streams, the
<br>
structure of the challenges it is presented with (including the
<br>
structure of simulated environments), and the complexity of the input
<br>
and output processing subsystems (e.g. whether they are linear
<br>
fixed-function pipelines, or something more bidirectional and mutable).
<br>
<p>I'm not going to launch into another debate about embodiment, but I'd
<br>
like to point out that the above subtleties would need to be
<br>
considered and understood before you could reasonably describe the
<br>
positions most of the researchers here would take on the issue.
