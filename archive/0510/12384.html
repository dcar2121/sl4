Ben Goertzel
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm writing this message just to see if there's anyone out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there who's interested in taking up a somewhat difficult but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very important math/software project, which would be very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helpful for AGI in general (and for my Novamente project, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it happens ;) ...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip about proofs important -- yes they are&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the good news is: there is a large corpus of mathematical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proofs already in mathematical form, check out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; www.mizar.org
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beautiful idea, huh?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is, their notation is complex, and their proof 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checker is proprietary, even though their corpus of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical theorems is publicly available.
</em><br>
<p>It's didn't seem complicated at first glance since
<br>
it was declared to be formally rigorous.
<br>
<p>What complications did I overlook?  (I only took a 
<br>
quick glance and downloaded the system out of curiousity,
<br>
which includes the same subject, and also intereste in
<br>
Novamente.
<br>
<p>It appears to be well-defined in Backus-Naur form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is needed is for someone to write some scripts that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translate Mizar definitions, theorems and proofs into some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard set-theoretic notation.
</em><br>
<p>I am entering an intensive phase of work at least until
<br>
after Thanksgiving (into Dec probably) so may not have
<br>
much time for even considering the task, but it does look
<br>
interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This will make the proofs much longer and less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-readable, but will enable the loading of Mizar data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into AI programs.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily -- depends on the format/syntax you
<br>
wish to use.
<br>
<p>What is the native language of Novamente?  What mathamatical
<br>
notations will/does Novamente use?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although it hasn't been our focus, Novamente has already been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used for some simple set-theoretic theorem-proving.  We could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; load Mizar into Novamente right now and play with inductive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning of &quot;how to prove theorems&quot; based on the Mizar corpus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of thousands of proofs --- ...
</em><br>
<p>According to one source it contains:
<br>
<p>&quot;As of 2005, it contained about 8000 definitions and 
<br>
40,000 theorems...&quot;
<br>
&lt; <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/encyclopedia/m/mi/mizar_system.htm">http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/encyclopedia/m/mi/mizar_system.htm</a> &gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...but we can't because translating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mizar into some more tractable notation is a major though 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforward task, and we don't have the resources to undertake it.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Straightforward&quot; should remove the &quot;major&quot; from this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would be a project of tremendous general value to the AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mathematics community, IMO.
</em><br>
<p>That alone would interest me in looking into it,
<br>
when time permits.
<br>
<p>What sort of real use would you get from this in
<br>
the near term?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might be that this could be done by hacking the Mizar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof-checker itself ---- if one could get access to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source-code of this, which would require asking the owners 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realllly nicely, I suppose.  Not having seen that code I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know if that would be the best approach or not.
</em><br>
<p>Supposedly it is written in Pascal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, if anyone out there is interested in taking on this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project please let me know.  It is obviously a bit of tedious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work, but the end result would be very very useful to a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of people and would help science advance.
</em><br>
<p>Although I am interested you might do better/faster to ask
<br>
of one of the Mizar groups/sites.  The links on the page
<br>
I referenced above, include:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Main Mizar site, contains links to the MML, to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Journal of Formalized Mathematics, and a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bibliography section linking to several 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;introductions to the system
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MML Query, is a search engine for MML.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freek Wiedijk's Mizar site, contains slides of a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conference talk about the system, as well as a 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40 page introductory article
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Association of Mizar Users
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A paper about Mizar history
<br>
<p>There are people much more skilled that I in parser
<br>
writing but it doesn't look THAT hard as such things
<br>
go.
<br>
<p>Maybe I missed some serious problem in my rapid
<br>
survey....
