</em><br>
<p>Moravec's solution seems to be the only plausible way to upload,
<br>
unless I'm missing something.  But in my past ruminations over how the
<br>
process would work, I've come up with some questions of my own.
<br>
<p>Clearly we recognize that by removing the entire brain and simply
<br>
attaching a fully functioning nanotech simulation to the spinal cord,
<br>
we would not have uploaded ourselves, but simply replaced our mind
<br>
with an identical (but not the same identity) copy.  We would still be
<br>
&quot;running&quot; (for the sake of smooth narrative, I'm using folk
<br>
terminology to discuss the mind rather than how I view consciousness
<br>
technically) on the brain that had been removed and perhaps stored in
<br>
a vat somewhere.
<br>
<p>At the other extreme, it seems intuitively obvious that sequential
<br>
single-neuron replacement of endogenous wetware with some functionally
<br>
equivalent silicon or nanotech hardware would in the end yield the
<br>
same (identity) mind running on a new substrate.  So at what point
<br>
between these two extremes to do we reach a threshold at which
<br>
identity is conserved or lost?  Could we, for example, remove one
<br>
entire cerebral hemisphere and replace it, then remove the other
<br>
hemisphere and replace that?  My intuition is that this would also
<br>
work (maybe I'm wrong).  What if we removed 75% of the brain in the
<br>
first procedure, then the other 25%?  Now I'm no longer so sure.
<br>
<p>What if we sped up sequential single-neuron replacement so that we
<br>
could replace 10 billion neurons per second (not at once, each
<br>
individually, but so quickly that at our ability to perceive time it
<br>
would seem to occur simultaneously)?  What if we sped that up so that
<br>
we could replace all 100 billion neurons within 0.1 seconds?  How
<br>
would that differ from a whole brain transplant?  If they are
<br>
essentially identical procedures, why would Moravec's method work and
<br>
not a whole brain transplant?
<br>
<p>Conserving the identity of the mind seems to be predicated on the
<br>
notion that the mind is a distributed set of computational processes
<br>
that requires some threshold level of integration of processes to
<br>
maintain its integrity.  But then the mind as a seamless global entity
<br>
is an abstraction -- an illusion.
<br>
<p>My thinking now is that there are two solutions.
<br>
<p>1)  There can't be a threshold.  If you can replace 50% of the brain
<br>
and conserve identity, then you must in principle be able to replace
<br>
51% and on up.
<br>
<p>2)  The threshold is exactly 50%.  The substrate that contributes more
<br>
cognitive processes to the hybrid mind becomes the dominant center of
<br>
narrative/perceptual gravity -- the new self.  Sequential
<br>
single-neuron replacement still works up to, perhaps, the minimum
<br>
firing rate of neurons, which is the rate limiting step of integrating
<br>
the distributed processes into a seamless global experience.  In other
<br>
words, if you replace neurons at a rate faster than their ability to
<br>
synchronize, you lose the integrity of the global experience (mind)
<br>
and replace it with a new one.
<br>
<p>I don't know which one is right.  It obviously depends on your
<br>
philosophy of mind, but I lean towards the second one.
<br>
<p>I welcome your comments.
<br>
