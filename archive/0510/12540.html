<p>You know, I am not sure I believe much of this.....
<br>
<p>I used to be an anti-virus software developer (for some outfit whose 
<br>
name I forget, which was then bought by Dr Solomon's software, which 
<br>
then became part of some conglomerate whose name I forget).
<br>
<p>I attended the primary AV conference in the late 90s, and believe me 
<br>
most of the AV folks were there, from all over the world.  It certainly 
<br>
was not an irrelevant academic meeting at that time.  Maybe it's changed 
<br>
since then, I don't know.
<br>
<p>As for the stuff about &quot;antivirus professionals frequently interact 
<br>
with, know, or are virus-writers&quot; this is an urban myth, as far as I can 
<br>
tell, and it used to piss us off a lot.  Antivirus professionals are, in 
<br>
my experience, unusually ethical people who are waging a war against the 
<br>
bad guys, and take it very seriously.
<br>
<p>I can put this in perspective, with a little evidence.  The large 
<br>
proportion of viruses seem to come from places like Indonesia (no AV 
<br>
companies out there), and one thing we would see time and time again was 
<br>
virus code that was dreadfully, hideously badly written.  It would just 
<br>
break our hearts to look at virus code where we could tell what the bozo 
<br>
was trying to do but we could see that he completely screwed it up. 
<br>
This was true of 99% of the cases:  the virus writers were pathetically 
<br>
incompetent.  Looking at their code, we used to joke that *we* could 
<br>
have written the code properly.  We often talked about how we could have 
<br>
written a sleeper virus that spread itself around the world and lurked 
<br>
for several months, then erased hard drives on half the world's 
<br>
computers;  such a thing is entirely possible, almost trivial.
<br>
<p>Any one of us AV people could have written several hundred extremely 
<br>
effective, devastating viruses by just taking those bollixed examples 
<br>
coming out of Indonesia and fixing them up.
<br>
<p>So why are there not any really well-written, devastating viruses? 
<br>
Because the AV people are NOT the switch-hitters that people think they 
<br>
are!  They do not moonlight as virus writers.
<br>
<p>It's a shame:  it makes such a good story to believe that the AV folks 
<br>
are helping the virus writers in order to line their own pockets.  It's 
<br>
just that it isn't true.
<br>
<p><p>Just my halfpenny's worth.
