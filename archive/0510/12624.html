<p><p>How does that actually emerge, though?  It's not as if these things will  
<br>
be invented one day and then suddenly begin to happen.  They'll emerge  
<br>
into the culture as fully as they can at each stage of the metamorphosis.   
<br>
It's already happening with agents that select news articles for you;  
<br>
they're a model of your behavior as far as picking out articles to read.   
<br>
As you train an agent, it becomes an extension of your mind.
<br>
<p>There's a text entry device called Dasher designed for disabled people  
<br>
that's really fun to try out-- it predicts what you're going to type,  
<br>
based on your past input.  After a while you can let yourself go into it  
<br>
and start to trust its predictions a little better and you're zooming  
<br>
along, flying through the words.  It predicts even across word  
<br>
boundaries.  My impression after a few days of use was that it could never  
<br>
get anywhere close to keyboard entry speed, but I'm glad I tried it just  
<br>
for the experience.  I could feel the computer's direction &amp; guidance--  
<br>
which was also MY OWN guidance-- carefully directing me as I chose  
<br>
characters &amp; words.
<br>
<p>The future of our connection with computers could feel a lot like that.   
<br>
It won't feel like some alien intelligence surrounding us; it will feel  
<br>
like our own intelligence.  It may also feel like other people's  
<br>
intelligence.  This is an idea for what comes after email: You train an  
<br>
agent &amp; send it to someone (where it picks news articles for them or  
<br>
arranges flowers or says &quot;meow&quot; in its own distinctive way).  Or picture  
<br>
the unconscious consensus building of shared agents, learning to bridge  
<br>
gaps between people that they weren't even aware of.
<br>
<p>I find myself in reverence of it.  The intelligence spilling out of  
<br>
everything.  Don't y'all?
