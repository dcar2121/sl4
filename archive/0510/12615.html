</em><br>
<p>I agree, but you also need to add 'inference mechanisms' and 'goal
<br>
system'. Even if you've got a working learning mechanism building
<br>
descriptive representations, that's still not enough for AGI unless
<br>
those representations can be processed efficiently by an inferential
<br>
search mechanism that can produce well-calibrated, nonobvious and
<br>
goal-relevant predictions. Representations are also critical to
<br>
accurately defining goals, and if you surrender the ability to specify
<br>
representational structure and/or allow them to be mutated in an
<br>
unknown, uncontrolled fashion by learning mechanisms, the design will
<br>
be incompatible with FAI (or any narrow, purposeful application). I'm
<br>
sure you're well aware of the former point Ben (and maybe the later
<br>
one), I'm just making this clear for other readers.
<br>
<p>Beyond that there's planning, tractable sensory processing, final
<br>
stage action generation, realtime processing, reflection and numerous
<br>
other required cognitive competencies. These things need to be
<br>
addressed in a design, and will not just 'emerge' given a mechanism
<br>
for learning representations, but they're not quite as critical and
<br>
interlinked as the four problems identified abouve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thinking only about the learning mechanism and not about the final emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures is not going to get you to AGI very quickly.  Nor is thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only about the final emergent structures and not about the learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms. In short, both traditional cog sci and complex systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking are needed, and need to be carefully coordinated.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with this because I don't think you need 'Complex systems'
<br>
theory to describe a functional learning system. I did at one time, but
<br>
that was before I knew how to make normative reasoning tractable. I'm
<br>
sure my views on 'emergence' in AGI are pretty clear by now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finding learning mechanisms that will generate &quot;anything stable&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly as useless for AI as finding knowledge representations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divorced from learning mechanisms.
</em><br>
<p>But I do agree with this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can let different learning mechanisms generate adult systems NOW,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it just takes a long time and a lot of work.
</em><br>
<p>Though of couse generating a whole system from scratch (i.e. by
<br>
evolutionary methods) is a different task from just generating 
<br>
representations.
