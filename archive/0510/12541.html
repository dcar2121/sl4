<p><em>&gt; Anyone have suggestions in how education can be brought to higher  
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>The first thing I would do is to repeal all compulsory schooling laws.   
<br>
Education is about learning &amp; exploring; it's bizarre (and ineffective) to  
<br>
try to mandate it through government.  I would then eliminate all  
<br>
government run schools, and move all of the resources that supported them  
<br>
(money, buildings, teachers and books but only those that are worth  
<br>
anything) to a completely new system of voluntary collective education &amp;  
<br>
information resources.
<br>
<p>One model I would emulate would be the Public Library system.  Anyone is  
<br>
allowed to use a library, but no one is required to.  One program which  
<br>
would be a high priority is free public access to the internet-- but at a  
<br>
much higher level than the libraries have managed to provide so far (more  
<br>
than half-hour blocks, for instance).  Much more emphasis should be placed  
<br>
on internet access (and training!) than on paper books (or any other  
<br>
ancient technology).
<br>
<p>For the most part, instead of the government hiring &quot;teachers&quot; full-time,  
<br>
it would hire people from various fields to spend a small amount of time  
<br>
giving free lectures and classes to the public.  Education would not be  
<br>
separate from the rest of society; a vital &amp; vibrant public intellectual  
<br>
discourse could be reignited.
<br>
<p>Colleges are (unlike schools for children) at least officially voluntary  
<br>
(although not all students seem to be attending completely on their own  
<br>
volition).  I wouldn't recommend therefore forcing any revolutionary  
<br>
change on them against their will.  In general though I believe that they  
<br>
should become dramatically more open &amp; responsive.  They are stuck in old  
<br>
ideas like the existence of a &quot;canon&quot; or the possibility of a particular  
<br>
individual having a solid grounding in all of the major intellectual  
<br>
fields; as knowledge expands they look more foolish every day.
<br>
<p>For instance, if colleges genuinely want to serve the public good, they  
<br>
should immediately make all of their materials &amp; lectures available  
<br>
online.  Anything else serves only the cause of elitism, not education.
