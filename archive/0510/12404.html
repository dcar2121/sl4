<br>
<p>Ok, over your past few posts I tended to agree with michael that you were 
<br>
using somewhat useless generalizations... not to mention some very, very 
<br>
weak motivational rhetoric. But uh, anyway.
<br>
<p>I think you just nailed a critical discussion point (somehow I don't see 
<br>
other people as agreeing...), which are these *presupposed representations*. 
<br>
I think your idea for a system that &quot;grows&quot; their own representations is a 
<br>
very interesting concept and should be fleshed out a little bit.
<br>
<p>On a broader note, I think discussion of knowledge representation in general 
<br>
(well, not in general, because we have a good case study to observe, with 
<br>
thousands of years of *empirical evidence* (not the fake, meaningless term 
<br>
that gets thrown around here every once in a while) compiled into writings 
<br>
all over the place) is an extremely important topic. Knowledge 
<br>
representation (whether you call them ideas, concepts, motivations, symbols, 
<br>
or whatever) is the convergence point of a huge domain of cognitive content, 
<br>
structure, and dynamic processes. In fact, I would argue, there already 
<br>
exists a full blown perfect AGI design distributed out there in all the 
<br>
psychology/philosophy paperwork that we haven't gotten around to reading 
<br>
yet.
<br>
<p>The foundations of knowledge representation, as I said, is the convergence 
<br>
point. All the important topics falling under intelligence are 
<br>
*functionally* and *structurally* linked to knowledge representation: for 
<br>
example, intelligent perception/awareness, motivational structures and 
<br>
function, explicit sensory data, abstract categorical knowledge. Analogies 
<br>
and metaphors are inherently formed based on some underlying conceptual 
<br>
structure or relation system. The formation of thoughts (and the strings 
<br>
that arise) are all necessarily and fundamentally dependent upon some 
<br>
conceptual structure. The definition between objective and subjective, 
<br>
rational and irrational, and countless other classes of psychological study 
<br>
are hinged upon some underlying, all-encompassing, conceptual system.
<br>
<p>This is one of the most important things I ever learned (LOGI did a decent 
<br>
job of actually trying to reconcile these issues- which is work at least in 
<br>
the right direction!). The conceptual structure of any workable AGI design, 
<br>
must literally be the most general representation possible- such that every 
<br>
single feature and process of intelligence (things such as every single 
<br>
concept self-containing the means to infinite complexity, the ability to 
<br>
create, formalize, and envision any formal system of any complexity, and the 
<br>
ability to learn, create, pretend, lie, self-decieve, and pretty much, 
<br>
cognitively, literally do whatever the hell it *wants*) must all be wrapped 
<br>
up, justified, and tractable within the conceptual architecture.
<br>
<p>Trying to reverse-fit a conceptual structure to anything less than 
<br>
everything will lead you absolutely nowhere (that has a nice ring to it...).
<br>
<p>Er, but what I mean by that is you can't point out a few necessary processes 
<br>
(even if they are both necessary and sufficient for intelligence) and start 
<br>
just gung-ho developing these little lame-ass useless incompatible tools, 
<br>
just as equally as you can't bottom-up create your own (necessarily, 
<br>
obscenely) presumptuous conceptual structure by attempting to fit it to some 
<br>
ill-specified necessary procedures that intelligence must incorporate. It's 
<br>
all one big shebang- the conceptual form fits the conceptual function, just 
<br>
as much as the intelligence functions fit directly with conceptual form.
