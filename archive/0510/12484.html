<p><em>&gt; I wrote something somewhat pertinent to this earlier today.  It was part  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a longer essay on immortality, but, even out of context it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehensible.
</em><br>
<p><p>Is the whole essay available somewhere?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It may be that, when some of us live long enough and become smart  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, we decide that maintaining individuality and the other human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illusions unto eternity isn't interesting, and it's better to merge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a larger posthuman intelligent dynamical-pattern-system.
</em><br>
<p><p>Recently I started to deeply ponder how I personally relate to the concept  
<br>
of undoing my own individuality as we pass into the Singularity.  What led  
<br>
me to consider the question was that I was thinking about replacing parts  
<br>
of my neural system with artificial versions.  For instance replacing my  
<br>
audio-input module with one with all sorts of DSP capabilities; as an  
<br>
electronic musician that's one set of possibilities with which I'm  
<br>
intimately aware.  What I realized was that if I and another person both  
<br>
had software parts in our brains, we could mix and match them.  You could  
<br>
try hooking up my weird DSP ears for a day and see what it's like; I could  
<br>
try out your self-prioritizing scheduler.
<br>
<p>The next level of weirdness after that is that we could create new wirings  
<br>
both within brains and between them.  Obviously any sort of intelligence  
<br>
imaginable becomes possible at that point, but one of the things I find  
<br>
most interesting is the new kinds of intimacy that become possible.  You  
<br>
can hook up with another person's emotions so you're always aware how they  
<br>
feel, of course, but that's just the beginning.  You can actually take it  
<br>
deeper than interpersonal knowledge, to the point where you are sharing  
<br>
actual components and processes.  You could work together with someone in  
<br>
clockwork, syncronized-swimming type coordination without even trying,  
<br>
because you share a scheduler that times both of your movements.  You  
<br>
could remember everything the other person has seen as well as you  
<br>
remember what you've seen, because you share the same life-recorder memory.
<br>
<p>If in the new world trust can somehow be made nearly absolute-- and I  
<br>
don't see why it wouldn't be (now that's a first in human history)-- then  
<br>
we may naturally form into very large very integrated communities.
<br>
<p>Before then what I imagine we'll see is many increasingly-intimate teams  
<br>
(married partners particularly) connected on many different levels.  I  
<br>
know that I personally am deeply in love with my husband, and so I will  
<br>
jump at just about any technology that allows us to relate more deeply,  
<br>
completely &amp; fluidly.
<br>
<p>Another possibility I've been considering is the rise of a new kind of  
<br>
cult, which (instead of fake coerced union like cults these days) are  
<br>
actually deeply interconnected and communal in fundamental ways.
<br>
<p>Humans haven't really been completely individual for millions of years  
<br>
now, and I think many of us are going to take the plunge into deeper forms  
<br>
of union.
