Hi all,
<br>
<p>I'm writing this message just to see if there's anyone out there who's
<br>
interested in taking up a somewhat difficult but very important
<br>
math/software project, which would be very helpful for AGI in general (and
<br>
for my Novamente project, as it happens ;) ...
<br>
<p>I am not alone in believing that mathematical theorem-proving is going to be
<br>
very important to AGI in the long run.  If an AGI is going to learn to
<br>
modify its own codebase intelligently, it had better understand mathematics
<br>
pretty well.
<br>
<p>But how will this hypothetical AGI learn to prove theorems?
<br>
<p>Of course, it could learn from human teachers, just as we humans do....  I
<br>
suspect this kind of teaching WILL play a role.
<br>
<p>But, it's not the only way... because AI programs will have the capability
<br>
to automatically ingest mathematical proofs in digital form....
<br>
<p>And the good news is: there is a large corpus of mathematical proofs already
<br>
in mathematical form, check out
<br>
<p>www.mizar.org
<br>
<p>Beautiful idea, huh?
<br>
<p>The problem is, their notation is complex, and their proof checker is
<br>
proprietary, even though their corpus of mathematical theorems is publicly
<br>
available.
<br>
<p>What is needed is for someone to write some scripts that translate Mizar
<br>
definitions, theorems and proofs into some standard set-theoretic notation.
<br>
This will make the proofs much longer and less human-readable, but will
<br>
enable the loading of Mizar data into AI programs.
<br>
<p>Although it hasn't been our focus, Novamente has already been used for some
<br>
simple set-theoretic theorem-proving.  We could load Mizar into Novamente
<br>
right now and play with inductive learning of &quot;how to prove theorems&quot; based
<br>
on the Mizar corpus of thousands of proofs --- but we can't because
<br>
translating Mizar into some more tractable notation is a major though
<br>
straightforward task, and we don't have the resources to undertake it.
<br>
<p>This would be a project of tremendous general value to the AI and
<br>
mathematics community, IMO.
<br>
<p>It might be that this could be done by hacking the Mizar proof-checker
<br>
itself ---- if one could get access to the source-code of this, which would
<br>
require asking the owners realllly nicely, I suppose.  Not having seen that
<br>
code I don't know if that would be the best approach or not.
<br>
<p>Anyway, if anyone out there is interested in taking on this project please
<br>
let me know.  It is obviously a bit of tedious work, but the end result
<br>
would be very very useful to a lot of people and would help science advance.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
