<p>Well, technically, an android /is/ male; a female humanoid robot would 
<br>
be a gynoid.
<br>
<p>Apart from that little equivocation, I think that focussing on one area 
<br>
where human attention cannot concentrate on more than one thing at a 
<br>
time is a bit of a red herring.  Conversations contain a lot of 
<br>
information, and the phonemes are presented at rates near the minimum 
<br>
durations of conscious experience.
<br>
<p>However, vocal conversation is just one means of information gathering.  
<br>
Many people have more success in carrying on two conversations at once 
<br>
if they are using different channels - for instance, reading and 
<br>
listening at once. 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, it is obvious that we can take in many pieces of 
<br>
information simultaneously,  whether it be many parts of a picture, two 
<br>
melodies at once (at least /I/ can memorise two short melodies played 
<br>
simultaneously and in counterpoint), or sound accompanying picture, 
<br>
accompanying touch.  We can simultaneously take in numerous pieces of 
<br>
information - numerous sources - and process them in parallellll. In the 
<br>
visual field, not only can we simultaneously take in many bits of 
<br>
information, we can simultaneously recognise several symbols.
<br>
<p>I think that one can infer far too much from the &quot;dual sound source 
<br>
experiment&quot;.  It may well be that experimentees &quot;could only attend to 
<br>
and remember one sound source at a time.&quot; 
<br>
<p>However, since Woody's contention that:
<br>
<p>&quot;the root of Consciousness (is) a focalizing agent, or self, that has no 
<br>
option but to switch its focalizing attention to a single source&quot;
<br>
<p>can be disproved simply by showing that a human can switch their 
<br>
focalising attention to more than one source, and since I think I showed 
<br>
several examples of this above, I think that this notion about 
<br>
Consciousness has to go sit out in the junk pile.
<br>
<p>There's a school of psychology that makes a big deal about mono-tracking 
<br>
consciousness: Gestalt psychology.  Gestalt psych is a helluva lot more 
<br>
sophisticated than just &quot; people can't carry on two conversations at 
<br>
once&quot;.  However, one of the primary contentions of gestalt theory - that 
<br>
something can't be ~~&quot;concieved of&quot; in two ways at once - is dead 
<br>
wrong.  If one stares long enough at the candle/faces picture long 
<br>
enough, one can see both at once.  One can step outside the illusion, to 
<br>
see both parts as images simultaneously, since I know I can.
<br>
<p>I think the &quot;oneness&quot; element of Consciouss is dreadfully overdone.  
<br>
Certainly, I think that it would make for a dreadful test of whether or 
<br>
not an android is conscious (&quot;Can you walk and chew gum at the same 
<br>
time? Yes?  Well, you're not a conscious AI then.&quot;). 
<br>
<p>There are some very interesting things about human Consciousness (Css). 
<br>
F'rinstance, our relation to Time is simple yet whacky and 
<br>
counterintuitive.  However, just because Human Css has certain 
<br>
characteristics, /especially/ limiting characteristics, one cannot 
<br>
expect that all forms of Css (&quot;General Consciousnessess&quot;) will share 
<br>
those same charachteristics.
