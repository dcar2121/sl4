<br>
<em>&gt;An android brain requires an artificial consciousness, defined as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post-contemporary computer system that encodes information and
</em><br>
performs
<br>
<em>&gt;logical operations on it via a focal point generally named a self. By
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;self&quot; I mean that focalizing agent exposed in the dual sound source
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiment. The subject had earphones on. On one side was played a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conversation, on the other was played another. What was revealed is
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;the subject could only attend to and remember one sound source at a
</em><br>
time.It
<br>
<em>&gt;was impossible to attend to both. So the root of consciousness was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;focalizing agent, or self, that has no option but to switch its
</em><br>
focalizing
<br>
<em>&gt;attention to a single source. This self also refers to itself as &quot;I&quot;
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt;has personal memory of this I's unique experiences. This self is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;focalizing agent of consciousness and so must be included in any
</em><br>
artificial
<br>
<em>&gt;consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Identity and a sense of self  is not a necessary prerequisite for an
<br>
artificial mind. The idea that it is comes from human inability to see
<br>
past our own identities - we feel like focalized agents and can't see
<br>
how any intelligence would function without a self too. The experiment
<br>
with the sounds shows more about the operations of our auditory system
<br>
than it does that the root of consciousness is a self. I find selves
<br>
quite a ludicrous concept, 'myself' for example - where is the me that
<br>
owns this self - and if there is one then there must be infinitely many
<br>
more - and I think 1 self is just as ludicrous as 2 or 75. Selfhood and
<br>
identity are just very evolutionarily useful - to the point where every
<br>
human can't really get by without one in everyday life. There are people
<br>
though who have suffered brain injuries that cause them to lose all
<br>
memory to the point where they couldn't tell you their own identity -
<br>
these people are clearly still intelligent though, they can talk, play
<br>
chess etc. and in some way they are still themselves - they still have
<br>
the same mannerisms for example. My point being that identity is just a
<br>
story we make up for ourselves - and in order to function in a world
<br>
populated by selves an AI would probably not be able to interact the way
<br>
a person does if it did not have a self but it isn't as necessary as you
<br>
make out - the patients with memory loss are still conscious . 
<br>
<p>As far as uploading is concerned I think a moravec transfer would be
<br>
the only way to preserve the self that feels like you, a complete brain
<br>
replacement would feel like death as soon as your brain was removed - of
<br>
course afterwards your body and your new brain would act and feel just
<br>
like the old one did if the new brain was modeled well enough. Selves
<br>
are simply collections of ideas in and around our minds that all point
<br>
to an agent behind their actions, but really all that exists is the
<br>
ideas and the feelings of being a singular entity. The truth is that if
<br>
you were to cut out small chunks of my brain say, and speak to me after
<br>
each chunk was removed I wouldn't be that different after each chunk and
<br>
different functions would be lost at different chunks - my 'self' would
<br>
disintegrate bit by bit also, there is not a point where my self resides
<br>
because the feeling of it being a singular thing at all is an emergent
<br>
property of the whole brain.
