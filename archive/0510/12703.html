<p>He has applied for a patent.  This application will probably be
<br>
reviewed in about a year and a half to two years.  A patent examiner
<br>
will then go over his claims, and most likely send back a rejection. 
<br>
He will then file an amendment, which will possibly be followed by a
<br>
final allowance of patent or rejection.  The whole process may take 2.5
<br>
years or so.
<br>
<p>I would like to say that a broad, sweeping patent such as he has filed
<br>
would be rejected.  Unfortunately, patent examiners have very little
<br>
time to examine patents, and they tend only to search for prior patents
<br>
on the same topic.  If no one has tried to patent self-consciousness
<br>
before, then his patent may be approved.  After that, if someone else
<br>
does something that violates his patent, he may sue them.  They can go
<br>
to court and perhaps overturn his patent, which sounds like it is very
<br>
broad.  However, just filing for an infringement case costs about a
<br>
million dollars, for both the plaintiff and the defendant.
<br>
<p>On the bright side, his patent will in any case expire 10/25/2025,
<br>
which may be before anyone figures out how to make an android.  His
<br>
application can be used to reject any future applications for patents.
<br>
