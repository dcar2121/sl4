</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't agree with this. You're saying that there's something special
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about a configuration of matter that has the *potential* to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought. But, even a rock probably has the potential to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, with the proper reconfiguration. A computer, more obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so. Even a freshly removed brain has the potential to generate thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again if the disconnected nerve cords are reconnected to some other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of input (and blood flow is supplied). This &quot;potential&quot; you speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of isn't binary, but a scale. Perhaps a measure of potential is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of man-hours of effort it would take to restore or create the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind activity?
</em><br>
<p>My last paragraph mentioned &quot;potential&quot; to generate mind-producing activity
<br>
of matter in the context of uploading/mind transfer. When you say that,
<br>
&quot;even a rock probably has the potential to generate
<br>
thought, with the proper reconfiguration,&quot; you are probably right in general
<br>
but if you examine the same statement within the context of mind transfer
<br>
then a rock doesn't have that potential. Let me explain.
<br>
<p>Uploading must start with a functional mind to be transferred and finish
<br>
with the same mind at the end of the procedure. You cannot start with a rock
<br>
and upload it in a way that it becomes a mind. Even though a rock might be
<br>
reconfigured into a mind sometime in the future, the only thing that is
<br>
relevant to the procedure is the state of mind-producing matter before,
<br>
during, and after transfer ends and in this context the rock wasn't a
<br>
mind-producing matter before the transfer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Furthermore, the idea that continuity of consciousness--even with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;potential&quot; complication thrown in--is a useful concept with regards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to identity was thoroughly addressed by my earlier post. Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree with my earlier post, or do you think that the &quot;potential&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept works around the difficulties I presented?
</em><br>
<p><p>I disagree with your views presented earlier because they assume that
<br>
successful uploading requires merely preserving identity which you seem to
<br>
ground in brain structure. (I hope this describes your views correctly).
<br>
While personal identity indeed depends, more or less, on brain structure,
<br>
treating that structure as the container that sufficiently captures the
<br>
essence of human existence, therefore, the only thing needed to transfer in
<br>
order to end up with an original mind when uploading finishes, ignores the
<br>
fact that life consists of something more than neuronal pattern. That
<br>
&quot;something&quot; is what I personally call &quot;presence&quot; (to separate from slightly
<br>
misleading terms like &quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;life&quot;) and define it simply as a
<br>
mind-producing activity of matter in space-time.
<br>
<p>Why presence is so important? It's because that's the true essence of human
<br>
existence, the stuff that allows us to be, feel, hear, see and think. A
<br>
static record of brain structure that describes identity and which doesn't
<br>
engage in presence means subjective experience of nothingness for the owner
<br>
of that record, aka, death. The main objective for uploading transfer should
<br>
be then to do it in a way that preserves presence, not necessarily identity.
<br>
While preservation of identity is still highly desirable, it is optional
<br>
while preservation of presence isn't. If the priorities were reversed,
<br>
would-be uploads might fall victims to, what I call, a &quot;silent holocaust&quot;
<br>
where all the original minds that were ever uploaded would experience
<br>
subjective death.
<br>
<p>Finally, to answer your last question, the &quot;potential&quot; I wrote about earlier 
<br>
is
<br>
just an auxiliary concept for the main idea of presence in its relation to
<br>
identity and preservation of life during uploading. It is the concept of
<br>
presence, not the potential to generate a single presence, that IMO solves
<br>
philosophical problems that come up during similar discussions. The
<br>
potential is there simply to account for a situation where uploading process
<br>
pauses.
