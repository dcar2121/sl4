<p><p>Here's another thing to consider, along that line of thought: Some of the  
<br>
things which will be part of each expanding brain will be numerous  
<br>
self-scans, of ever-increasing complexity.  At first these might just be  
<br>
for instance (presuming that people were to take an interest fairly  
<br>
quickly) consumer-grade fMRIs.  They would grow more &amp; more precise,  
<br>
probably including continuous brain scanning at some level of detail 24  
<br>
hours-- just for the heck of it.
<br>
<p>Won't there be a certain number of these people in the future?  People who  
<br>
have massively expanded, developed sufficient autonomy to no longer need  
<br>
their brain as a central command station, then &quot;died&quot; but left behind  
<br>
records of thousands of hours of brain scanning (&amp; associated  
<br>
audiovisuals), perhaps catalogs of pictures of every individual neuron,  
<br>
perhaps a frozen head.  Some such people are likely to care about being  
<br>
resurrected, and in some form perhaps they will be.
<br>
<p>We'll have stranger problems by then, I'm sure.
