Jay Dugger
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thrun confidently concluded: ``It's a no-brainer to me that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cars will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; drive themselves.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I talk to other Americans about this prospect, they tend 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to dismiss or reject it  as somehow unlikely--usually for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liability reasons. Some change their minds when I point out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-driving cars mean their children won't have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confiscate their keys  from them when they grow too old to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safely drive.
</em><br>
<p>And although they will not like it, when cars can 
<br>
more safely (statistically) drive your kids to school
<br>
and their other functions than kids can drive themselves, 
<br>
many parents will prefer to have the car do the chaufering 
<br>
than to allow kids to drive themselves.
<br>
<p>As long as parents are buying the car for their
<br>
children they (theorectically) get to decide if
<br>
the kids get the drive-control key/password.
<br>
<p>And no one needs to be designated driver when
<br>
alcohol is involved.
