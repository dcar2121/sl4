<em>&gt; As far as I am concerned, the widespread (is it really widespread?) 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It's not difficult to show this by a definitive fiat:
<br>
<p>Woody Long defined Humanoid intelligence:
<br>
<p>1. &quot;Humanoid intelligence requires humanoid interactions with the world&quot; --
<br>
MIT Cog Project website
<br>
<p>This means a fully &quot;human intelligent&quot; SAI must...feel the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. 
<br>
<p><p>If we accept that to be &quot;humanoid&quot;, an intelligence must get pissed-off 
<br>
at losing, we can also define &quot;humanoid&quot; as requiring self-interest 
<br>
/selfishness, which is exactly the characteristic that I thought 
<br>
friendliness was trying to avoid.   An intelligence that cares for all 
<br>
intelligences will necessarily care for its own well being.  Putting 
<br>
emphasis on one particular entity, where the interests are particularly 
<br>
clear, is the start of unfairness.  Strong self interest is synonymous 
<br>
with counter-utility.  You don't need to get stabby and violent for 
<br>
egocentrism to start causing harm to others.  Anyhoo, strong self 
<br>
interest does not necessarily lead to violent self-preservation, but it 
<br>
has a fair degree of overlap.

<p><p>It doesn't always take full understanding to know when something is 
<br>
wrong.  I don't speak much German (just a few words), but I can often 
<br>
tell when someone is way off.  It doesn't take an Olympic level cyclist 
<br>
to recognise when someone has fallen flat on their face.  That said, 
<br>
humility is a good thing
