Richard,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For anyone who reads the below explanation and still finds no spark of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding, I say this:  go do some reading.  Read enough about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world of complex systems to have a good solid background, then come back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and see if this makes sense.  Either that, or go visit with the folks at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Santa Fe, or bring those folks in on the discussion.  I am really not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to beat my head against this any more.
</em><br>
<p>I've been to SFI and spent more time at Los Alamos Labs (from where SFI
<br>
was spawned) talking to &quot;complex systems&quot; people there.  I understand
<br>
complex systems science and philosophy pretty well.  It doesn't
<br>
necessarily have the implications you're saying it does.  It merely
<br>
provides conceptual guidance for AI work, it doesn't really tell you
<br>
anything definite about AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First, I need to ask you to accept one hypothetical... you're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to work with me here and not argue against this point, just accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as a &quot;what if&quot;.  Agreed?
</em><br>
<p>I agree with your hypothesis about the nature of knowledge representations
<br>
and their growth, up till the point where you say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But now the complex systems theorist is really worried.  &quot;Hang on:  if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you build learning mechanisms with the kind of power you are talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about (with all that interaction and so on), you are going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating the Mother of all complex systems.  And what that means is, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get your learning systems to actually work and stably generate the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content, you will eventually have to change the design of the elements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Why? Because all our experience with complex systems indicates that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you start by looking at the final adult form of a system of interacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; units like that, and then try to design a set of local mechanisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (equivalent to your learning mechanisms in this case) which could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate that particular adult content, you would get absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nowhere.  So in other words, by the time you have finished the learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms you will have completely thrown away your initial presupposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design for the structure and content of the adult elements.  So why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste time working on the specific format of the element-structure now?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   You would be better off looking for the kinds of learning mechanisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that might generate *anything* stable, never mind this presupposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure you have already set your heart on.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with the above, and you haven't demonstrated it.
<br>
<p>I think that the emergent adult knowledge  structures and the learning
<br>
mechanisms need to be considered together.
<br>
<p>Thinking only about the learning mechanism and not about the final emergent
<br>
structures is not going to get you to AGI very quickly.   Nor is thinking
<br>
only about the final emergent structures and not about the learning
<br>
mechanisms.
<br>
<p>In short, both traditional cog sci and complex systems thinking are needed,
<br>
and need to be carefully coordinated.
<br>
<p>Finding learning mechanisms that will generate &quot;anything stable&quot; is exactly
<br>
as useless for AI as finding knowledge representations divorced from
<br>
learning mechanisms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The development environment I suggested would be a way to do things in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that (to some people) &quot;backwards&quot; way.  It addresses that need, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed by my hypothetical complex systems theorist, to look at what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens when different kinds of learning mechanisms are allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate adult systems.  And it would not, as some people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insultingly claimed, be just a matter of doing some kind of random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search through the space of all possible cognitive systems ... nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so crude.
</em><br>
<p>I see why the dev. environment you suggested would be great for AI
<br>
development, what I don't see is why you think it's necessary.
<br>
<p>We can let different learning mechanisms generate adult systems NOW,
<br>
it just takes a long time and a lot of work.  Which means that success
<br>
depends on having very good intuitive foresight regarding which  learning
<br>
mechanisms are going to give rise to good emergent knowledge strutures.
<br>
<p>I have worked a long time to develop this kind of intuitive foresight.
<br>
Whether I've really succeeded, time will tell ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can dispute that the above characterization of cognitive systems is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct.  All power to you if you do:  you will never get what I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to say here, and there would be no point me talking about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure of the development environment.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I accept many but not all parts of your characterization of
<br>
cognitive systems.
<br>
<p>And I think your proposed dev. env. would be fantastic for AI, but is
<br>
not necessary.
