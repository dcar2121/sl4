<p>
Here are some of my intuitions on the matter. Subjective consciousness
<br>
is completely formless. The information it contains is either one
<br>
bit--either you're conscious or you're a zombie--or no bits, if
<br>
there's no such thing as zombies. If I were to lose consciousness, say
<br>
by going to sleep, and wake up as another person, with her memories
<br>
and her habits, her whole brain, in other words, I would be identical
<br>
to her. I would be her. The fact that my subjective consciousness,
<br>
before I went to sleep, was inhabiting the brain of Chris Capel
<br>
doesn't make any difference at all.
<br>
<p>So, I don't think it's meaningful to speak of identity and
<br>
consciousness as if they're somehow intertwined. They're not.
<br>
Consciousness is not continuous in humans anyway, so unless your
<br>
concept of identity allows that a person becomes new each time they
<br>
awake, then continuity of consciousness isn't a useful concept in
<br>
discussing identity. And if that is your concept of identity, then I
<br>
don't see how you could regard it as immoral to terminate the
<br>
continuity of an identity, since it's so easy to do and it happens
<br>
naturally so often.
