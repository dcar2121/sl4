(On a separate note, has anyone else noticed that some of the 
<br>
post-numbers in the SL4 archives are distinctly off from the index 
<br>
listings?  At least, clicking any indexical link tends to take me at 
<br>
least 3 messages away from my intended destination for August this 
<br>
year... haven't checked other months thoroughoghly with this in mind.)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Until 10 years ago, one of the factors in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Drake Equation, the number of planets per star,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a complete unknown.  Since then we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detected about 170 extra-solar planets. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a large enough sample to notice something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Please take note, however, that our current detection methods strongly 
<br>
bias the samples:  our techniques for detecting extrasolar planets are 
<br>
skewed towards detecting large planets in very close orbits.  Our 
<br>
detection methods are not yet (at my last knowledge) anywhere near up to 
<br>
detecting a planet as small as Earth at Earth-orbit distances.
<br>
<p>(more)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  ... ... The interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing is the likelyhood of finding a planet around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a star is strongly correlated with metallicity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is something like 30 times higher for high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;metallicity stars vs. low ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Because of the detection-method bias, I think that the inferences we can 
<br>
strongly draw need a little qualification:  high metallicity stars are ~ 
<br>
30 times as likely to have close-orbiting giant planets.  It is not 
<br>
guaranteed that terrestrial planetoids are so much more likely to be 
<br>
found around high metallicity stars.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, although the premeses are a touch inaccurate, the 
<br>
conclusion of the following paragraph is still reasonable:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;High metallicity stars are generally younger, so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;implication is that there are not many planets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around old stars.  Thus when considering the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Drake Equation, it would be incorrect to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a uniform number of planets over the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This tends to make the hypothesis that we are an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;early civilization more likely.  Younger stellar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems are more likely to have planets, but have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not had as much time for evolution to progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
(New point) This is where the Drake equation is still messing about with 
<br>
unsupported conjecture.  It's taken -what? - some 3 billion years to 
<br>
develop from simple to complex life, and some 545 million years to get 
<br>
from complex life to tool &amp; symbol using life.  Based on our sample size 
<br>
of 1, it's kinda difficult to make much of a statement about whether 
<br>
this is uncannily fast evolutionary progress, or pitifully slow.  I 
<br>
couldn't make any sort of informed statement about what rate most of 
<br>
this evolution would typically take, but given that (1) a helluva lot of 
<br>
evolutionary effort goes into staving off parasites (2) this doesn't get 
<br>
any easier in later evolutionary periods (3) earlier organisms would 
<br>
likely have less genetic material dedicated to staving off parasites;  
<br>
it would seem that some complex-organism evolution /might/ be able to 
<br>
work quicker in comparitively young biological groups.  Restated, it 
<br>
might be &quot;easier&quot; for complex organisms to get smart earlier in the game 
<br>
than later in the game.
