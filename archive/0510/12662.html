<p>I don't agree with this. You're saying that there's something special
<br>
about a configuration of matter that has the *potential* to generate
<br>
thought. But, even a rock probably has the potential to generate
<br>
thought, with the proper reconfiguration. A computer, more obviously
<br>
so. Even a freshly removed brain has the potential to generate thought
<br>
again if the disconnected nerve cords are reconnected to some other
<br>
form of input (and blood flow is supplied). This &quot;potential&quot; you speak
<br>
of isn't binary, but a scale. Perhaps a measure of potential is in the
<br>
number of man-hours of effort it would take to restore or create the
<br>
mind activity?
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the idea that continuity of consciousness--even with this
<br>
&quot;potential&quot; complication thrown in--is a useful concept with regards
<br>
to identity was thoroughly addressed by my earlier post. Do you
<br>
disagree with my earlier post, or do you think that the &quot;potential&quot;
<br>
concept works around the difficulties I presented?
