His ideas are well-done and useful (which doesn't mean that they are
<br>
correct, of course).
<br>
<p>His book On Intelligence is well worth reading.  Here's my 30 second
<br>
summary:
<br>
<p>- The cool part of human intelligence happens in the neocortex.
<br>
- The neocortex is all uniform: every module is functionally equivalent to
<br>
every other.
<br>
- The purpose of the neocortex is to do pattern matching.
<br>
- Intelligence happens when you stack many pattern matchers together in a
<br>
hierarchy.
<br>
<p>Further details that he considers important are that information travels
<br>
down the hierarchy as much as up, that time is an important player in the
<br>
system, and that prediction is a very important role of the pattern
<br>
matchers.
<br>
<p>Jeff recently started a company (Numenta, not to be confused with Novamente
<br>
:-) to build the core technology that he believes is involved.  They demoed
<br>
at AC2005, but didn't really have enough built to allow one to make an
<br>
informed judgment about how they're doing.
<br>
<p>My personal read is that Jeff's a super-smart guy with talent, ambition, and
<br>
money, as well as some good ideas.  I get the sense (possibly unfairly) that
<br>
he's a little simplistic in his approach: to my mind, he comes across as
<br>
somewhat dogmatic that almost everything interesting is the result of this
<br>
single absolutely invariant module.
<br>
<p>I've recently started work on a visual system which is in many ways similar
<br>
to Numenta's, although I'm inclined to stray further from biological
<br>
faithfulness than they seem to be.  I'll probably have a more informed
<br>
opinion about how useful the approach is in a few months...
