<p>
'Flash' uploading, involving scanning the brain and copying the data to 
<br>
a computer, and Moravec transfer, involving replacing individual neurons 
<br>
with functional equivalents, are not the only possibilities.
<br>
<p>These discussions seem to assume that there must be immediate, or at 
<br>
least very rapid *replacement* of the biological brain or it's parts. 
<br>
I'd like to suggest a variation of this that seems more acceptable to me.
<br>
<p>The kind of uploading that i'd personally consider to be consistent with 
<br>
continuity of consciousness and identity is not exactly a transfer at 
<br>
all, more an expansion. That is, incrementally adding artificial parts 
<br>
to the brain, thus increasing the capabilities of the mind, until the 
<br>
biological brain is a small, pretty insignificant part of the whole. By 
<br>
that time, the individual's identity would be mostly resident in the 
<br>
artificial part, and the death of the original brain wouldn't make a 
<br>
great deal of difference.
<br>
There would ideally be a significant time lag between the beginning and 
<br>
end of the process. At least some weeks, perhaps even years.
<br>
This process is also consistent with the way our current brains evolved 
<br>
(AFAWK), with the duplication of existing modules followed by 
<br>
specialisation.
<br>
<p>Of course, this scenario makes certain assumptions about the nature of 
<br>
consciousness/identity, but it seems the most likely practical path to 
<br>
uploading, and following it will guarantee that we learn what we need to 
<br>
about which parts of the brain are important for consciousness and 
<br>
identity. If it turns out, as many suspect, that these things are 
<br>
distributed over large parts of the brain, the above method will easily 
<br>
work. If not, and some specific modules are involved, the strategy would 
<br>
be applied at a smaller scale, expanding/duplicating those modules, 
<br>
until the greater part of the person's mind was running in the 
<br>
artificial part.
<br>
<p>If the 'expanded' mind still finds that it's not conscious when the 
<br>
biological part sleeps or is temporarily inactivated, but the rest is 
<br>
active as normal, then we'll know we're on the wrong path. If the mind 
<br>
is still conscious while the bio-brain sleeps, we'll know that it's well 
<br>
on the road to being a full upload of the original conscious mind into a 
<br>
machine.
<br>
<p>Probably one of the biggest difficulties with this idea would be working 
<br>
out how to get such a hybrid biological/artificial system to work 
<br>
smoothly, without traumatising the original biology.
<br>
<p>But at least i would be happy that the end result would still be me. A 
<br>
new me, granted, with a 'bigger' mind, but still me.
