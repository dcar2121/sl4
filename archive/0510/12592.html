Richard,
<br>
<p>It's true that making an AGI, given current software technology, is a big
<br>
pain, and it takes a long time to get from vision to implementation.
<br>
<p>I agree that better software tools would help make the process a lot easier,
<br>
even though I have a feeling your vision of better software tools is a bit
<br>
overidealistic.
<br>
<p>However, I have chosen to focus on AGI itself rather than on building better
<br>
tools, because I've judged that given my limited resources, I'll probably
<br>
get to AGI faster via focusing on AGI than via focusing on tools first.
<br>
While tools work is conceptually easier than AGI work by far, it still
<br>
requires a lot of thought and a lot of manpower.
<br>
<p>I would be more interested in your tools ideas if they were presented in a
<br>
more concrete way.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That is not what I said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, but it's what your assertion implies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not a straw man: you yourselves are taking the &quot;logic&quot; approach that I

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of this entire argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The scope of 'yourselves' is unclear, but I certainly don't take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the position you're attempting to dismiss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Stop trying to deflect attention to some other group:  I am talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about you and your approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may be talking about me, but you are not describing my approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nonsense: LOGI hasn't solved the grounding problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but it does propose a solution in abstract, albeit without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much constructive detail. My point wasn't that the problem has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusively solved, it hasn't, my point was that most researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are well aware of the problem and there have been several credible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts to solve it (most of which await experimental verification).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cite one example of systematic variation of local mechanisms in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AGI systems, in search of stability.  There is not one.  Nobody has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tried the approach that I have adopted, so why, in your book, is it not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; novel?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plenty of researchers have tried a large number of local dynamics in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their system. Lenat's Eurisko project is a good example; he tried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of different hand-created heuristics and numerous structural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features in a search for a system that would work. This is usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what happens when a system is built and fails to live up to initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectations; researchers fall back on trial and error. Eurisko is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually a good example of a combination of manual and automated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trial-and-error; the system itself was a self-modifying design full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of semi-specialised 'local dynamics', with Lenat providing high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level guidance and the system itself doing local exploration of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design landscape in each revision. I admitt that I am unclear as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to how you intend to direct your design space exploration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, where else is there a development environment that would easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allow someone who was not a hacker to produce 100 different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *designs* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cognitive systems, using different local mechanisms, then feed them the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same sets of environmental data, then analyse the internal dynamics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make side by side comparisons of the behavior of those 100 systems, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; get all this done in a week, so you can go on to look at another set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 100 systems next week?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how you can bypass fundemental limits on how quickly humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can invent and input design complexity. Incremental improvements are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible with a lot of work, but if you seriously expect to try 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designs in a week they will need either very simple specifications or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be very similar. This translates into either a very low resolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search (if you used some kind of expression system to translate simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specs into functional systems) or a very slow search of an extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large design space. This kind of thing could work if intelligence was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truely modularisable, you had all the essential modules predeveloped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you were just looking for the correct way to connect them, but even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if that was possible it just pushes all the hard work into specifying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and building the 'adequate set' of modules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I am not talking about you, when was the last time you built a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complete AGI and tested it to see if the local mechanisms you chose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rendered it stable (a) in the face of real world environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interaction and (b) in the course of learning?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I haven't done this of course (yet; I'm working on it), but I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see how you can possibly apply this as a research standard. /No one/
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has built a complete AGI yet, and past attempts to do so have taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years or decades. It's hard even to find someone who will admitt that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they tried and failed; usually people say that they had to abandon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their projects due to lack of time/money/staff, or maintain that just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few more years work should crack it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; This part does not appear unreasonable; it seems similar to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 'experimental investigation of AGI goal system dynamics' that Ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; has historically been in favour of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You have never got anywhere near trying it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you know this? You don't, of course. Actually I have got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about as close to trying this sort of experiment as one can get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without embarking on a multi-year implementation project. I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done a fair bit of exploratory implementation covering a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably diverse range of basic architectures, of which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem solver based on enhanced genetic algorithms probably came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the closest to your sensibilities, though obviously the design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of anything that can be implemented in a couple of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; months is sharply bounded and well below what you'd need for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; First-principles research in FAI? You don't have a workable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theory of FAI, you just have some armchair speculation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have such a theory nor am I working on one. But formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories of this calibre do not pop out of the ether fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formed. They are the result of years of hard work on a progressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of precursors, which I /can/ observe the SIAI steadily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making progress on. I expect that you would write off the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field of theoretical physics as useless 'armchair speculation', or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least you would if you could find a way to ignore the successes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that discipline.
