</em><br>
<p>I think that a key problem is the existence of ivy-league
<br>
institutions like Harvard and MIT.  These places are basically
<br>
institutions to insure that the children of the wealthy can suck
<br>
up most of society's resources for their own education, and to
<br>
give them a leg up on everyone else in terms of contacts and
<br>
reputation.  Contrary to popular belief, there are no academic
<br>
scholarships at most of the most-respected institutions, except
<br>
ROTC scholarships and minority scholarships.
<br>
<p>It is grotesquely unfair that the universities that only the rich
<br>
can afford receive much, much more federal assistance than the
<br>
colleges for the poor.  MIT receives $50,000 per year per student
<br>
in federal grant money (~$500,000,000/yr grants, ~10,000 students).
<br>
<p>When colleges and universities hire new grads for faculty positions,
<br>
the primary factor they consider is what university they came from.
<br>
Likewise for undergrads applying for grad school.
<br>
Once you've attended a university that cost less than $30,000/yr
<br>
tuition, there's little chance you can ever get onto the academic
<br>
track and into a research position.  So the ivy-league schools
<br>
make academia itself a hereditary institution.
<br>
<p>I would like to see a study of the benefits to society of a dollar
<br>
spent at Harvard vs. a dollar spent at a community college.  If
<br>
only there were a way of normalizing for the advantages that Harvard
<br>
students have going in in terms of eventually creating companies
<br>
that create GDP.  It is true that MIT grads have founded a large
<br>
number of companies, but it's also true that they have rich friends,
<br>
a better awareness of the possibility of starting a company,
<br>
and they have (or at least did in the late 1990s when I often
<br>
visited there) venture capitalists coming to MIT and begging students
<br>
to take their money.
