Hi,
<br>
<p>I remember there was some discussion on this list a while back regarding
<br>
complex-systems concepts like &quot;emergence&quot; and their utility (or otherwise)
<br>
for understanding AI and the world in general.
<br>
<p>Well, I stupidly left the lights on in my car yesterday (while it was parked
<br>
for a few hours) and wound up sitting for 90 minutes waiting for AAA to come
<br>
give me a jumpstart.  In the meantime I sketched out (literally) on the back
<br>
of an envelope what seems to be an elegant definition of &quot;emergence&quot; in
<br>
terms of basic computational concepts.
<br>
<p>The p.s. to this email presents this definition.  It's math-y so
<br>
non-math-happy readers should just ignore it!
<br>
<p>The main point is to show that the notion of emergence can be formulated in
<br>
a precise and elegant way.  I have made efforts in this direction in some of
<br>
my prior writings but I think this one is a little nicer.
<br>
<p>The basic intuitive notion pursued is that emergence occurs when one has a
<br>
situation so that:
<br>
<p>·	f is a pattern in the combination of x and y
<br>
·	There is no g similar to f so that g is a pattern in x or g is a pattern
<br>
in y
<br>
<p>I just introduce what seems to be the minimal math formalism (or close to
<br>
it) needed to make the above two sentences precise.
<br>
<p>The next step would be to try to do some real math modeling and see if the
<br>
intuitive examples of emergence observed in complex systems can be easily
<br>
cast into this kind of formal perspective
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p>******
<br>
<p>P.S.
<br>
<p>OK, here goes...
<br>
<p>Suppose we have a set E of entities with an operation + defined on it.  (For
<br>
instance, E might be the set of subsets of some other set of elementary
<br>
entities; or it might be the set of multisets formed from some other set of
<br>
elementary entities.)
<br>
<p>The + operator may be assumed commutative and associative.  Examples of
<br>
suitable + operators would be operations of set or multiset union.
<br>
<p>Consider also a set F of function mapping E into E.  Elements of E may be
<br>
mapped into elements of F via considering them as “constant functions.”
<br>
Define an operation * on F as function composition.  Of course, * is neither
<br>
commutative nor associative.
<br>
<p>The operation + may be extended from E onto F in an obvious way, so that we
<br>
may now think about {+,*} as algebraic operations on F.
<br>
<p>Distributivity may be assumed with regard to function application, i.e.
<br>
<p>(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
<br>
<p>Within F, we may assume there is a zero element (the constant function
<br>
mapping everything to zero) so that
<br>
<p>x+0=0+x=x
<br>
<p>0*f = 0
<br>
<p>and a 1 element (the identity function) so that
<br>
<p>1*f = f*1 = f
<br>
<p>Finally, let us assume there is a valuation measure H on E, meaning that for
<br>
any x in E, H(x) is defined as some nonnegative real number.   Also assume a
<br>
two-component valuation measure H(x,y) so that H(x,0) = H(x).
<br>
<p>Intuitively, H(x) is to be thought of as the complexity of producing x, and
<br>
H(x,y) is to be thought of as the complexity of producing x given y as
<br>
input.  This interpretation makes it plausible to assume that
<br>
<p>H(f*g) &lt;= H(f) + H(g,f)
<br>
<p>We may now define the notion of pattern as follows:
<br>
<p>f is a pattern in x iff:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f(0) = x and H(f) &lt; H(x)
<br>
<p>That is, f is a pattern in x if f produces x and yet f is simpler than x.
<br>
<p>As a consequence, it follows that
<br>
<p>f*g is a pattern in x if:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f*g)(0) = x and H(f)+H(g,f) &lt; H(x)
<br>
<p>(note that this is if, not iff).
<br>
<p>We may define a distance measure between elements of F as follows:
<br>
<p>D(f,g) = (H(f,g) + H(g,f))/2
<br>
<p>If H(f,g) is interpreted as the complexity of producing f from g as an
<br>
input, then this is a metric (a mathematically valid measure of distance)
<br>
since
<br>
<p>H(f,g) &lt;= H(f,w) + H(w,g)
<br>
<p>from which it follows that D also obeys the triangle inequality.  We may
<br>
produce a similarity measure from this by normalizing D to [0,1] via
<br>
<p>D1(f,g) = D(f,g) / [1+D(f,g)]
<br>
<p>and then setting
<br>
<p>sim(f,g) = 1 – D1(f,g)
<br>
<p>Now, what about emergence?  Emergence occurs when we have a pattern in a
<br>
combination of two things, that does not occur in either of the two things
<br>
individually.  That is, it occurs when one has a situation so that:
<br>
<p>·	f is a pattern in x + y
<br>
·	There is no g similar to f so that g is a pattern in x or g is a pattern
<br>
in y
<br>
<p>Thus we see that a natural notion of emergence arises from simple notions of
<br>
computation.
<br>
<p>This account can be made probabilistic if we introduce a “reference
<br>
dynamical system” and define H(f,g) as the probability of f being produced
<br>
within time T by the dynamical system beginning from initial condition g.
<br>
For instance, if the reference dynamical system for computing H(f,g)
<br>
consists of a system that creates random computer programs taking g as
<br>
input, choosing each program with probability proportional to 2-(program
<br>
length)  , then this probabilistic-dynamic perspective recovers an
<br>
approximation of what one gets from defining H(f,g) as relative Kolmogorov
<br>
complexity.
