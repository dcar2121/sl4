</em><br>
<p>This is reminiscent of science fiction fan trying to find a physical
<br>
basis for teleportation. Not that there's anything wrong with that
<br>
per se; teleportation (and similar conceive-first-rationalise-later
<br>
sci-fi ideas) would be a great thing to be able to do, and it's worth
<br>
checking carefully that there isn't a cunning way to create the desired
<br>
effect within violating the known constraints of what's possible in
<br>
our reality.
<br>
<p>But this is beside the point; as several people have been saying, the
<br>
question isn't 'how can we perfectly copy physical objects, specifically
<br>
neurons', it's 'why should we /care/ if the imperfections are minute, far
<br>
below the threshold of a systematic effect on behaviour or indeed minute
<br>
in comparison to the general noise and chaos that biological brains
<br>
experience?'. Why should our standard of personhood, including self
<br>
identity, rely on perfect physical continuity when this continuity seems
<br>
completely seperable from every objective and subjective character of
<br>
a mind? This is why I was criticising your assumptions, not your
<br>
conclusions, and so far you haven't offered anything to strengthen those
<br>
assumptions...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the uploaded mind's brain substrate will not be in any way attached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the original mind's brain. 
</em><br>
<p>...such as why an 'attachment' is necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The upload can still be sentient and his memories will cause him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think he is the original,
</em><br>
<p>Until the two copies begin to diverge, why does substrate continuity
<br>
make one any more the 'original' than the other? It's physically
<br>
measureable, but why does it /matter/? Once they have diverged, why
<br>
does one have any more claim to the prior history and identity than
<br>
the other?
<br>
<p>I would note that if the many-worlds interpretation is correct then
<br>
there are no 'originals'; you're not being copied constantly, you're
<br>
being /split/ constantly, at a level of detail many orders of magnitude
<br>
below anything that could be considered neural computation. This
<br>
cosmology may or may not be correct, but if you can't get your
<br>
philosophy of unique individuals to work under many-worlds then you're
<br>
fighting a losing battle to get it to work under any other form of
<br>
multiple-self-instantiation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The process describes how to maintain continuity of consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not how to preserve identity...  But personal identity emerges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from matter
</em><br>
<p>You keep talking about 'identity', but normally that means memories,
<br>
personality and assorted external trappings. Since you've accepted
<br>
that this things can be duplicated to beyond the threshold of
<br>
objective or subjective measurability, you must mean something else,
<br>
and it would help if you defined the manner of this 'emergence' (a
<br>
term used here in its typical application).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; like a Rubik's Cube can be solved if it were attached via tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strings to billions of other points in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid I don't understand this analogy; how does this work
<br>
exactly?
