Mungojelly,

<p><em>&gt; One last thing: The shape of emergence of computer intelligence is not

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; of whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cohesive system.  It's not a baby.
</em><br>
<p>I wrote something somewhat pertinent to this earlier today.  It was part of
<br>
a longer essay on immortality, but, even out of context it may be
<br>
comprehensible.
<br>
<p>This passage occurs right after some text discussing the neuroscience proofs
<br>
that free will, the phenomenal self and the continuity of consciousness are
<br>
all basically illusions constructed by the mind in its attempt to
<br>
rationalize and understand itself and generally make its life easier...
<br>
<p>&quot;
<br>
One can perceive the preservation unto eternity of the human illusions of
<br>
free will, self and continuity of consciousness as a good thing - or one can
<br>
view it as a burden, like the preservation unto eternity of stomachaches and
<br>
bad tempers and pimples.  An equally valid, alternate perspective holds that
<br>
human-style individual minds, ridden with illusions as they are, are merely
<br>
an intermediary phase on the way to the development of really interesting
<br>
cognitive dynamics.
<br>
<p>Among humans, illusions like will, self and consciousness-continuity are
<br>
just about inevitably tied in with intelligence.  Highly rigorous long-term
<br>
routines like Zen meditation practice are able to whittle away the
<br>
illusions, but they seem to have other costs - I don't know of any Zen
<br>
masters who make interesting contributions to science or mathematics, for
<br>
example.  Among humans, the reduction of these illusions on a practical
<br>
day-to-day basis seems to require so much effort as to absorb almost the
<br>
entire organism to the exclusion of all else.  Yet the same will not
<br>
necessarily be the case for superhuman AI's, or enhanced human uploads, or
<br>
posthuman humans with radical brain improvements.  These minds may be able
<br>
to carry out advanced intellectual activity without adopting the illusions
<br>
that are built into the human mind courtesy of our evolved brains.
<br>
<p>A mind without the illusions of self, free will or continuity of
<br>
consciousness might not look much like a &quot;mind&quot; as we currently conceive
<br>
it - it would be more of a &quot;complex, creative, dynamical system of
<br>
inter-creating patterns.&quot;  FutureBen and FutureBush, as envisioned above,
<br>
are actually fairly unadventurous as prognostications of the future of
<br>
mind - as described above, they're still individuals, with individual
<br>
identities and histories; but it's not at all clear that this is what the
<br>
future holds in store.  If one's value system favors general values like
<br>
freedom, growth and joy (Goertzel, 2004a), rather than primarily valuing
<br>
humanity as such, such a posthuman relatively-illusion-free mind may be
<br>
considered superior to human minds . and the prospect of immortality in
<br>
human form may appear like a kind of second-rate &quot;booby prize.&quot;
<br>
<p>All these issues center around one key philosophical point: What is the goal
<br>
of immortality?  What is the goal of avoiding involuntary death?  Is it to
<br>
keep human life as we know it around forever? That is a valid, respectable,
<br>
non-idiotic goal. Or is it to keep the process of growth alive and
<br>
flourishing beyond the scope painfully and arbitrarily imposed on it by the
<br>
end of the human life?
<br>
<p>Human life as it exists now is not a constant, it's an ongoing growth
<br>
process; and for those who want it to be, human life beyond the current
<br>
maximum lifespan and beyond the traditional scope of humanity will still be
<br>
a process of growth, change and learning. Fear of death will largely be
<br>
replaced by more interesting issues like the merit of individuality and
<br>
consciousness in its various forms -- and other issues we can't come close
<br>
to foreseeing yet.
<br>
<p>It may be that, when some of us live long enough and become smart enough, we
<br>
decide that maintaining individuality and the other human illusions unto
<br>
eternity isn't interesting, and it's better to merge into a larger posthuman
<br>
intelligent dynamical-pattern-system.  And it may be that others of us find
<br>
that individuality still seems interesting forever.  Resource wars between
<br>
superhuman post-individuals and human individuals can't be ruled out, but
<br>
nor can they be confidently forecast -- since there will likely so many
<br>
resources available at the posthuman stage, and diversity may still seem
<br>
like an interesting value to superhuman post-individuals (so why not let the
<br>
retro human immortal individuals stick around and mind their own business?).
<br>
<p>These issues are fairly hard to &quot;feel out&quot; right now, stuck as we are in
<br>
this human form with its limited capacity for experience, intelligence and
<br>
communication.  For  me, the quest for radical life extension is largely
<br>
about staying around long enough, and growing enough, to find out more about
<br>
intriguing (philosophically, scientifically and personally fundamental)
<br>
issues like these.
