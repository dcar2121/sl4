<em>&gt; [Original Message]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Martin Striz &lt;<a href="mailto:mstriz@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Consciousness%20(Re:%20physics%20of%20uploading%20minds)">mstriz@gmail.com</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
&nbsp;If legos could be used to build a machine that encodes information and
<br>
performs logical operations on it, at a sufficient level of complexity,
<br>
that lego contraption would
<br>
<em>&gt; be conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think before we can name it a post-contemporary conscious computer system
<br>
it needs more. Consciousness requires a focal point generally named a self.
<br>
By &quot;self&quot; I mean that focalizing agent exposed in the dual sound source
<br>
experiment. The subject had earphones on. On one side was played a
<br>
conversation, on the other was played another. What was revealed is that
<br>
the subject could only attend to and remember one sound source at a time.
<br>
It was impossible to attend to both. So the root of consciousness was a
<br>
focalizing agent, or self, that has no option but to switch its focalizing
<br>
attention to a single source. This self also refers to itself as &quot;I&quot; and
<br>
has personal memory of of this I's unique experiences. This self is the
<br>
focalizing agent of consciousness and so must be included in any artificial
<br>
consciousness. Consciousness is also intertwined with and propagated by raw
<br>
sense data (sensor signals), as well as emotional and motivational content
<br>
that create the same interactive effect. So artificial consciousness
<br>
requires all this, and is it not true that to create artificial
<br>
consciosness in a robot is to create artificial life itself?
