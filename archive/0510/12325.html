</em><br>
<em>&gt; human intelligence is not the same as disdain for understanding the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics of human intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Once again, you demonstrate my point for me....
<br>
<p>1)  You deliver irrelevant insults:
<br>
<p><em> &gt;                           I suppose that in your lexicon, &quot;Complex
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Systems Theory&quot; and &quot;mechanics of human intelligence&quot; are synonyms.
</em><br>
<p>I don't need to respond to this.
<br>
<p><p>2)  You make assertions about things you know nothing about:
<br>
<p><em> &gt;                                  Disdain for your private theory of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; human intelligence is not the same as disdain for understanding the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mechanics of human intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>I have never discussed my &quot;private theory of human intelligence&quot; on this 
<br>
list, so how could you possibly disdain it?  I have discussed one issue 
<br>
only.  You responded to that issue with personal insults, red herrings 
<br>
and numerous comments that showed you did not know the difference 
<br>
between complex systems theory and chaos theory (a confusion that 
<br>
rendered most of your other statements worthless).
<br>
<p>3)  And you demonstrate the most amazing contempt for the subject and 
<br>
all the other people who study it:
<br>
<p><em> &gt;            I spent my first six years from 1996 to 2002 studying the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; mechanics of human intelligence, until I understood it well enough to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; see why it wouldn't work.
</em><br>
<p>To be able to justify your assertion that &quot;it&quot; wouldn't work, you would 
<br>
have to do experiments (simulations) and/or produce some theoretical 
<br>
ideas, and *most important of all* you would also have to make coherent 
<br>
replies to those who find fault with your position.  I have read your 
<br>
writings on the subject:  I can find nothing but rambling, 
<br>
stream-of-consciousness speculations.  Where are your experiments? 
<br>
Where are your coherent arguments in support of this claim?  Where are 
<br>
your coherent replies to your critics?
<br>
<p>I was one of those critics.  I produced arguments based on a vast body 
<br>
of empirical data.   You made no coherent response to those arguments, 
<br>
never demonstrating that you even comprehended what the arguments 
<br>
actually were about  In fact, looking back over the sum total of words 
<br>
you wrote against the position that I elaborated earlier, I can find 
<br>
nothing that is not either irrelevant posturing, a dismissal of an 
<br>
entire body of research on the grounds that you consider it worthless 
<br>
(this being exactly the contempt that I referred to above), an ad 
<br>
hominem attack on either my credentials or those of hundreds of other 
<br>
researchers (whose work you confuse with work going on in another 
<br>
field), or a blatant non-sequiteur.
<br>
<p><p>The specific point I made in my post above was a small one:  I was 
<br>
referring to the way that some people here tend to assert that the 
<br>
structure of the human mind is clearly sub-optimal, or clearly flawed, 
<br>
or clearly not the best way to design an AGI, or clearly bad from the 
<br>
point of view of guaranteeing Friendliness.   This is an entirely 
<br>
debatable point of view, but when challenged, a vocal subset of SL4 
<br>
likes to respond not with arguments, but with the kind of invective that 
<br>
you just delivered.
<br>
