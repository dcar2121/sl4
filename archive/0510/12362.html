<br>
<p>&quot;Watch me - do it like this!&quot;
<br>
<p>Stanley, the robotic car from Stanford University that triumphed in a
<br>
recent $2 million race across desert terrain, learned to drive in much
<br>
the same way as any 16-year-old: by following the lessons of
<br>
experienced humans.
<br>
<p>When the Stanford team first started testing Stanley, a blue
<br>
sport-utility vehicle, he had a 12 percent blunder rate for ``false
<br>
positives'' -- incorrectly assuming 12 percent of the objects in front
<br>
of him were obstacles big enough he had to swerve around them.
<br>
<p>So the team instructed Stanley's software to take notes while a human
<br>
driver maneuvered the car over different types of terrain. By
<br>
following this guidance, the false positive rate dropped to one in
<br>
50,000 objects.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>Thrun, 38, believes robotic driving will someday advance to the point
<br>
where human geography is changed. No longer will big office buildings
<br>
or shopping centers need to be surrounded by big parking lots.
<br>
Instead, cars will dutifully park themselves on the edge of cities,
<br>
waiting for a call to come retrieve their owners.
<br>
<p>Long before then, robotic systems will save thousands of lives by
<br>
taking the wheel at the last moment to prevent accidents caused by
<br>
driver error.
<br>
<p>Thrun confidently concluded: ``It's a no-brainer to me that cars will
<br>
drive themselves.''
