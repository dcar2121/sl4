</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beyond that there's planning, tractable sensory processing, final

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; interlinked as the four problems identified abouve.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree with these comments, Michael.
<br>
<p>I wasn't trying to give a complete
<br>
statement of my approach to AGI, merely pointing out what I saw as the
<br>
conceptual flaw in Loosemore's statement, using his own language.
<br>
<p>The Novamente design addresses all these issues (and more) explicitly,
<br>
and does not expect them to &quot;just emerge.&quot;  However, it DOES expect
<br>
specific representations for specific items of knowledge -- and
<br>
specific procedures carrying out specific goals -- to emerge within
<br>
the framework that addresses these issues.  I.e. the architecture
<br>
exists to provide a high-level framework in which medium-level
<br>
structures and processes can emerge from lower-level learning
<br>
mechanisms.  (to simplify things just a bit.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thinking only about the learning mechanism and not about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; final emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; structures is not going to get you to AGI very quickly.  Nor is thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only about the final emergent structures and not about the learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mechanisms. In short, both traditional cog sci and complex systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking are needed, and need to be carefully coordinated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree with this because I don't think you need 'Complex systems'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory to describe a functional learning system. I did at one time, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was before I knew how to make normative reasoning tractable. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure my views on 'emergence' in AGI are pretty clear by now.
</em><br>
<p>Well I am not sure whether or not we really disagree here on anything
<br>
substantive.  It may be that we are just using words in different ways
<br>
due to our different historical biaes.
<br>
<p>I didn't say &quot;complex systems theory&quot; btw I said &quot;complex systems thinking.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is because there isn't really any general &quot;complex systems theory&quot;
<br>
out there....  there are theories of particular classes of complex systems,
<br>
and then there is mathematical theory relevant to complex systems (e.g.
<br>
dynamical systems theory) and then there is complex systems *philosophy*
<br>
(which I do find useful for guiding my thinking in many cases)
<br>
<p>I find that dynamical systems theory ideas are useful for understanding
<br>
some aspects of Novamente, such as the dynamics via which complex
<br>
representations may &quot;spontaneously&quot; arise over time out of the combined
<br>
actions of a lot of little inference steps carried out in pursuit of
<br>
a lot of little goals...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We can let different learning mechanisms generate adult systems NOW,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it just takes a long time and a lot of work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Though of couse generating a whole system from scratch (i.e. by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary methods) is a different task from just generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Alife is one approach to AI, but IMO nowhere near the most
<br>
efficient approach...
<br>
