<p><em>&gt; Surely it can be appreciated that two atoms

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well, I would have thought that was a pretty damn good definition of
<br>
identical, but never mind. If the copy and the original are “different”
<br>
in the way you describe then there is absolutely no way of my knowing
<br>
which one I am, and thus absolutely no reason to care.
<br>
<p>And by the way, don’t call me Shirley.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Each atom maps a separate path in space-time. 
</em><br>
<p>You have no way of knowing even in principle if that is true or not. For
<br>
all you know the two atoms could be instantaneously and constantly
<br>
changing positions and there would be absolutely no change in you or me
<br>
or any conservable measuring instrument or anything else in the known
<br>
universe. 
<br>
<p>Or perhaps the two atoms (or trillions of atoms) have been cooled to a
<br>
millionth of a degree above Absolute Zero and formed a Bose-Einstein
<br>
condensate, a single particle with a single quantum wave function. Then
<br>
warm the condensate up again and two particles pop out, but it is
<br>
meaningless to talk about which is which. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An upload diverges from the original as soon as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is created, even if we assume a perfect level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of copying resolution.  
</em><br>
<p>That of course is quite true, but the phenomenon is not unique to
<br>
uploads. If I shoot a spit ball at you then you will be different a year
<br>
from now than if I had not, and probably much sooner than that.
<br>
<p>If you told me you were going to make an exact copy of me and then
<br>
immediately destroy the original I wouldn’t be concerned, but if you
<br>
said there would be a delay of a second or two between the two events,
<br>
time enough to have a conscious thought, then I’d start to get worried
<br>
because death is having a last thought.
