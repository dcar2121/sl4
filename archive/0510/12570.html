<em>&gt; [Original Message]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Michael Vassar &lt;<a href="mailto:michaelvassar@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20AGI%20motivations">michaelvassar@hotmail.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There should be ways of confidently predicting that a given machine does
</em><br>
not 
<br>
<em>&gt; have any transhuman capabilities other than a small set of specified ones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are not sufficient for transhuman persuasion or transhuman 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering.  It should also be possible to ensure a human-like enough
</em><br>
goal 
<br>
<em>&gt; system that you can understand its motivation prior to recursive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improvement.
</em><br>
<p>As a business owner whose business is to build / have built an android
<br>
robot and enter it in the Roboprize Prize Fight against a human-controlled
<br>
robot, I am faced by these SAI safety issues daily. The above sums up
<br>
precisely the company policy on android safety protocols. Androids of
<br>
course have humanoid or human-like strong AI embedded systems, and so are a
<br>
part of the SAI field. 
<br>
<p>It appears androids in households will first appear in Japan. Its predicted
<br>
that in 10 years, 1 of 3 Japanese households will have some sort of human
<br>
intelligent like humanoid in the house. Maybe in 20 years they could be SAI
<br>
androids. Thing is they can be connected to the internet and so are quite
<br>
powerful.
<br>
<p>So my question is - in this context - what does a friendly android, or in
<br>
Japanese principle of harmony terms, a &quot;safe'built&quot; android mean,. i.e.,
<br>
what are the industry android safety protocols?
<br>
<p>For me, there are three things the Japanese corporate builders don't want,
<br>
for fear of being sued and disliked by consumers. This is a huge cash cow
<br>
and all they want is to be &quot;admired and desired&quot; by consumers. So there it
<br>
is, in the consumer's house, stockholders awaiting the explosion of
<br>
consumer love, millions invested in development and brand naming, and for
<br>
sake of argument, let's say it is interfaced to your system. Now there's
<br>
motivation to make sure its not a defective product. These three primary
<br>
things are destruction of property, persons, or pets. So the android safety
<br>
protocols must be: androids can't - by goal, end or means - break the
<br>
stereo, harm the kids, or harm the pets. To be thus friendly and
<br>
safe-built, to have a perfect industry safety record will ensure consumer
<br>
love and desire, and profits.
<br>
<p>This might not be the whole of the android safety protocols, but it is a
<br>
core, necessary part, for avoiding lawsuits and consumer contempt. The
<br>
android can't be sued for failing to save my life, it no such product
<br>
feature is claimed.
<br>
<p>So this is why I agree with your following  -
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;An AI which others can see the non-transparent thoughts of, and which
</em><br>
others can manipulate the  preferences and desires of, is in some respects
<br>
safer than a human, &gt;so long as those who control it are safe. 
<br>
<p>In conclusion, this is why I feel confident in the prospect of friendly SAI
<br>
androids, and the growth of this industry.
