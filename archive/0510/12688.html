A neuron can feedback and alter the rest of the brain too, in addition to being subject to influence from it.  So replacing one neuron would be difficult.  Even if implemented in practise, the biological original might have something to say about being &quot;discarded&quot;.
<br>

<br>
I fail to see how identical classes of materials are equated with equality.  Surely it can be appreciated that two atoms of hydrogen are not identical, even if they appear that way and even if our measuring tools cannot tell them apart.  But they are different.  Each atom maps a separate path in space-time.  Each atom can be destroyed independantly of the other.  Same for the minds emergent from physical brains.  The process of uploading instantaneously creates a separate space-time entity.  The concept is so simple I see no reason to bring esoteric physics into discussion.

<br>
<p>The idea is that, as it has been claimed, the brain is a dynamic machine,
<br>
and recording static information might not suffice. So instead of
<br>
deep-scanning a neuron and replacing it with a mechanical component, a
<br>
neuron is &quot;isolated&quot; and studied by a system that transparently keeps it
<br>
connected to the rest of the brain while it studies the way it reacts to
<br>
inputs. After a while, considering the knowledge we would have at the time
<br>
of the internal structure of the neuron, we could build a dynamic model of
<br>
the neuron, and replace it with a mechanical sync'ed component that keeps
<br>
dynamic state. The way to do this proposed in the book is by non-invasively
<br>
carrying forward this process while writing the dynamic model on a computer
<br>
substrate, and after the model is complete and has been compared to the
<br>
biological original for a while in order to ensure that there are no errors,
<br>
the biological components are discarded altogether.
<br>
<p>This would deal with the dynamicity issues mentioned above, as well as the
<br>
matter of so-called pressence, since the dynamic state of the mechanical
<br>
substrate would share all the structure and causal links with the biological
<br>
substrate.
