<p><em>&gt; Specifically, I have in mind things like wearables that are able to

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions, your task list, and the state of various information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeds you're subscribed to; do background data mining based on your
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler) tasks.
</em><br>
<p><p>As well as considering what rigs (i.e. wearable computers) can do  
<br>
autonomously, we should consider what they can do in response to quick  
<br>
vocal commands.  Even if they're not good enough at making decisions to be  
<br>
trusted with much of the judgement work, they can still be so closely  
<br>
integrated with their users that they transform their users' thoughts into  
<br>
actions with a fluidity we've never seen before.
<br>
<p>For instance consider the activity of sending a picture to a friend.  At  
<br>
the moment I have the technology to do that, of course, but it requires  
<br>
rather a long series of actions: Take the picture, plug in the camera,  
<br>
upload the picture, write an email, attach the file.  A near-future  
<br>
streamlining of that could look more like this: After I press the button  
<br>
to snap the picture, I say (or type if I like) &quot;Computer, send that to  
<br>
John and Bob and Mary.&quot;  It's not so much a big deal that this would save  
<br>
me a few minutes of work; rather what's a big deal is that I probably  
<br>
would never have bothered to send that picture to John and Bob and Mary if  
<br>
it hadn't been so easy.
<br>
<p>Raw computing power is only meaningful to the structure &amp; future of  
<br>
society to the extent that it's actually used to do particular  
<br>
computations with particular results.  We have neurons in our heads whose  
<br>
&quot;total computing power&quot; by whatever metric is much greater than that  
<br>
required to do, for instance, digital manipulation of photographs, but  
<br>
there is absolutely no way of photoshopping in an unaided human brain and  
<br>
therefore the consequences of an increase in ability to photoshop should  
<br>
not be expected to be linear in respect to the total number of  
<br>
mathematical operations being done or any such nonsense.  It's useful to  
<br>
look at these exponential trends in computing technologies, because  
<br>
they're factual and easily graphed/understood and they do really point to  
<br>
the magnitude of the transformation we're undergoing, but we shouldn't be  
<br>
fooled by those graphs into thinking that the most dramatic  
<br>
social/practical consequences are going to wait around for the later half  
<br>
of the curve in order to spring.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Ideally, it would be able to detect your mood to know whether you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in especial need of certain kinds of exercise or relaxation or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entertainment in order to stay in peak condition.
</em><br>
<p><p>Of course most people wouldn't like it if their rig TOLD them that they  
<br>
ought to get some exercise, but maybe it could find a subtler way to make  
<br>
it happen.  I think that we'll see computers interacting a lot more with  
<br>
the unconscious minds of their users.  They'll be analyzing unintuitive  
<br>
sets of data, reaching conclusions that you wouldn't understand even if  
<br>
they explained it (e.g. evolving color schemes based on heart-rate  
<br>
monitoring).  Feedback cycles are closing here.
<br>
<p>It's an entirely reasonable question to ask, &quot;In what ways have computers  
<br>
ALREADY begun to integrate with us on unconscious levels?&quot;  This question  
<br>
should turn up more &amp; more dirt as we go forward, but I believe it already  
<br>
does turn up a little.  User interface design for example has been  
<br>
progressing on unconscious levels.  In the near future the human  
<br>
unconscious will be deeply probed by automatic creation &amp; mining of  
<br>
metadata.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And a related question: Do the sort of intelligent agents that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive these systems pose any takeoff risk?
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes obviously.  That's why we're taking off at the moment.  Get rid of all  
<br>
of the intelligent agents (i.e. make people design chips by hand) and you  
<br>
wouldn't see a Singularity this century.  We are on the curve, we are  
<br>
inside the curve, and there are no realistic methods of controlling it at  
<br>
hand.  So we strap in, right?
