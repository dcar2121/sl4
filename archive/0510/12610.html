<em>&gt; Dude, you have a VERY different interpretation of the term &quot;self-aware&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going on there. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can deal with people using the term &quot;intelligent&quot; to cover

<em>&gt; non-conscious entities, even though I find this a dumbing-down of the
</em><br>
term.
<br>
<em>&gt; But self-aware???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely, a basic requirement of an entity being &quot;self-aware&quot; is that has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consciousness.  I know the c-word makes a few people round here squirm a 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reaction to entities is not awareness of the entities.  Bugs react to

<em>&gt; damage to their bodies (~ their selves), but, as far as anyone knows, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they don't operate on the basis of &quot;My body is in some way different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from stuff that is not my body&quot;.  They don't have concepts, let alone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts of the self. 
</em><br>
----------------------
<br>
<p>lol, of course I should have said precisely &quot;rudimentary, pseudo self
<br>
awareness.&quot; We do need more settled definitions in this field. For example,
<br>
I also generally accept Honda's and Sony's marketing materials which say
<br>
they are &quot;intelligent systems,&quot; though I undertand this to mean
<br>
rudimentary, pseudo intelligence.
<br>
<p>narrow AI - rudimentary intelligent robot systems such as above, expert
<br>
systems, partial systems, etc.
<br>
strong AI - human like intelligent systems with a conscious self awareness
<br>
of unique self and  unique personal experiences, as you mention. 
<br>
android - human shaped SAI robot.
<br>
<p>In robotics we need a new term, like &quot;droids&quot; for SAI robots, so that we
<br>
get androids that are human shaped SAI robots, and paradroids that are
<br>
other-shaped SAI robots. (flying paradroids, talking dog paradroids, etc)
<br>
<p>I understand via prior posts that there are at least two species of SAI,
<br>
humanoid intelligence SAI and human equivalent intelligence SAI. I won't
<br>
disagree as long as they meet the definitional requirements of SAI.
<br>
<p>I should tell you where my interest comes from in all this. My business
<br>
project is to enter an android in the historic Roboprize.com Prize Fight.
<br>
To be entered the Rules Committee must certify that the entry is an
<br>
authentic android. They have asked me what parameters I would use, and I
<br>
said if must be driven by an SAI system and pass the Searle Chinese room
<br>
test. If not, it should not be considered a consciously self aware,
<br>
thinking, autonomous android, and be turned down.
<br>
<p><p>What would you accept as an SAI android if you were on the rules committee?
<br>
Roboprize.com wants the AI community to agree with them that their android
<br>
they choose is in fact an android. Could the AI community come to an
<br>
agreement that it is or is not an authentic android?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;However Sony built it so that when it meets a certain amount of light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;resistance, it self-destroys this behavior; and its jaw goes slack. If a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;hobbiest trys to get inside and tinker with this behavior, it self
</em><br>
destroys
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the system, and is rendered inoperable. It implements what they call in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Japan the principle of harmony. It also could be considered an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;implementation of Asimov's First Law of Robotics. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is any tinkering, the entire system destroys itself, or just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain types of tinkering result in certain failures?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Either way, the comparison to Asimov belies the flaw in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methodology:  Rather than structuring the system for safety with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground-up approach, you are describing a system with a safety catch 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;plastered on&quot;.
</em><br>
------------------
<br>
In fact that actuator mechanism is not something plastered on, but a
<br>
structural ground-level component. Just because it implements Asimov Law 1,
<br>
doesn't mean its plastered on. And there are many ways to thread the ground
<br>
structures with safety checks so that the robot never destroys person,
<br>
property or pet. The robot is driven by goals. If these behaviors are
<br>
excluded from the goal list, both ends and means, so that neither
<br>
self-modification, tinkering, or user suggestion can cause them to occur,
<br>
then FAI exists. In other words, I predict that we will never read in the
<br>
news that a Honda household SAI android has become defective and willed the
<br>
destruction of a person, pet, or property.
