<em>&gt; It's true that making an AGI, given current software technology, is a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain, and it takes a long time to get from vision to implementation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that better software tools would help make the process a lot easier,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though I have a feeling your vision of better software tools is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overidealistic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I have chosen to focus on AGI itself rather than on building better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools, because I've judged that given my limited resources, I'll probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get to AGI faster via focusing on AGI than via focusing on tools first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While tools work is conceptually easier than AGI work by far, it still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires a lot of thought and a lot of manpower.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would be more interested in your tools ideas if they were presented in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more concrete way.
</em><br>
<p>But it would be a misunderstanding to treat my suggestion as &quot;here is a a
<br>
possible good way to build an AGI.&quot;   If it were that sort of suggestion, I
<br>
would be just one of a hundred tool designers with great ideas.
<br>
<p>I am saying something much more serious.  I am saying that we *need* to do
<br>
things this way.  We will eventually realise that anything else is not
<br>
going to work.  
<br>
<p>We have to build systems that grow their own representations, we cannot
<br>
presuppose those representations and then, later, tack on some learning
<br>
mechanisms that will feed those representations with new knowledge.  This
<br>
fundamental point is crucial to my argument, so make sure that you are
<br>
absolutely clear about that before we discuss fine details about the
<br>
environment.
