<p><em>&gt; As far as computer intelligence goes, it appears to me you are  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drastically underestimating the impact. (Yes, the rabbit hole goes much  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much deeper, in fact- its something of black hole, or ... *cough*  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity... hehe).
</em><br>
<p><p>Well let's not get into a fight over who can be most awed by the  
<br>
incomprehensibility of the Singularity.  There's no winner to that  
<br>
conversation; it descends instantly into madness.  For instance, we can  
<br>
readily assume that over the next decade or two we will invent The Orgasm  
<br>
Button (prototypes, for women only alas, are already in use) and generally  
<br>
otherwise intimately control our own pleasure and pain responses.   
<br>
Therefore the question &quot;what will posthumans do with these amazing powers&quot;  
<br>
can only reasonably be answered &quot;why, whatever they program themselves to  
<br>
do.&quot;  There's no sense to it.
<br>
<p>So all we can really do is look at what the approach is going to be shaped  
<br>
like.  Orgasm Buttons (and all the future versions, such as True Love  
<br>
Buttons and Complete Relaxation Buttons), in spite of the fact that they  
<br>
will fundamentally alter the basic equations of human society in ways  
<br>
which (combined with everything else going screwy) make it impossible to  
<br>
even vaguely imagine how things will end up, will at the beginning be  
<br>
simply objects existing in the actual society which we have grown up in.   
<br>
Given the combined hedonistic consumerism and puritan moralism of the US,  
<br>
how widely are Orgasm Buttons going to be implanted here?  Will there be  
<br>
attempts to make them illegal?  Or will they somehow slip under the radar  
<br>
and become as widely pacifying as television?  Will some parts of the  
<br>
world be hooked up before others?
<br>
<p>It's important to think about, not because we can predict what the end  
<br>
result is going to be after everything becomes integrated into society,  
<br>
but because different orders &amp; rhythms of the process may produce very  
<br>
different results.  Would a Singularity where most of the instigating  
<br>
primate race are on The Button make things simpler &amp; reduce the dangers of  
<br>
panics &amp; so forth?  Would it make society unable to respond quickly enough  
<br>
in the face of major risks, because nobody can be bothered to care so much  
<br>
about the real world anymore?  Would it make everyone more capable of  
<br>
rationally considering situations &amp; less involved with their own personal  
<br>
problems?
<br>
<p>In other words, I'm not ignoring the strangeness of the Singularity  
<br>
because I'm not aware of it.  I'm ignoring it because I believe that the  
<br>
only answerable questions lie on this side of it.  We have no choice but  
<br>
to take things one step at a time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The fact that an intelligence is on a computer is much more than just  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer abilities being &quot;added on&quot; to human abilities. It isn't just  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human+computer, but human^computer. Each bit of computer ability that is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added, also totally overhauls and modifies the human side. Intuitive  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms (like tying your shoe) could be modified to have independent  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness (ie. information searching, processing, intelligent analyzing,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc). You could transfer yourself into an &quot;accelerated simulation&quot; where  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every 24 hours of subjective time is equal to a nanosecond- thus living  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple lifetimes in the span of one second. Matrix-uploading of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge will be possible. You could spend an entire simulated lifetime  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructing a single email, no harm no problem- especially because you  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could modifty yourself to not get bored by the incredibly long journeys.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every tiny piece of &quot;real-time&quot; empirical observation could be analyzed  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a million different ways for years at a time, and compared and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyzed against the entirety of public human knowledge- all in less  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a second- in fact, all in less than one *subjective* second,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the entire process could be both *really* intelligent and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automated on a PURELY intuitive level.
</em><br>
<p><p>OK, sure, but this still seems to me like monkeys imagining what it'll be  
<br>
like to be human-- &quot;We'll get the bananas SO easily man you don't  
<br>
UNDERSTAND!!  There'll be big PILES of bananas!!&quot;-- Who is it that's going  
<br>
to write this email?  Who are they writing to and why do they care?  These  
<br>
aren't just souped up humans we're talking about, really.  The bottom is  
<br>
going to fall out.  Being human is about having evolved to survive in a  
<br>
mammalian body on the planet Earth; it's going out of style.
<br>
<p>It's sort of like what I've noticed about the expansion of the world wide  
<br>
web.  At first it was an expansion of this one network, basically,  
<br>
connected by links.  Then, as it got really really really big, it started  
<br>
to have subprojects within it that followed the same expansion curve.   
<br>
Wikipedia hit its own curve and quickly became as big as the whole web was  
<br>
a few years ago.  Livejournal is as big as the web used to be.  Bubbles  
<br>
are going to continue expanding in this boiling broth, until there are  
<br>
various regions that are as big as the whole web is now-- as big as  
<br>
Wikipedia and Livejournal and Slashdot and everything else, all combined.   
<br>
Many of them.  The cycles will continue until every detail of the physical  
<br>
world is known with fantastic intimacy.  They will continue as real worlds  
<br>
emerge, other worlds, full of characters as intelligent as human beings  
<br>
are now.  They'll keep expanding.  Sure, it goes all the way down.
<br>
<p>Since the only answer to &quot;how will people feel about these new powers&quot; is  
<br>
&quot;however they program themselves to feel,&quot; one scenario is that everyone  
<br>
does something completely different.  One person might form a clone army,  
<br>
with millions of copies of themselves, all assigned to different tasks.   
<br>
Another person might go around scanning trees and flowers and become a  
<br>
forest internally.  Someone might specialize in breeding artificial life,  
<br>
which would develop to the point where they were genuine alien  
<br>
intelligences.  Then every part of every person goes through its own  
<br>
expansions and does something different from every other part.  People  
<br>
become as big internally as the whole Earth is now.
<br>
<p>What's your plan?  What kind of god do you want to be?  I'm just trying to  
<br>
focus on getting us to survive our approach.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Try to imagine a real-time conversation between two people with these  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faculties, Alice, and you will see humans have barely even stuck their  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toe into the rabbit hole.
</em><br>
<p><p>It's like getting into cold/hot water, though-- the first toe you stick in  
<br>
is the hardest part.
<br>
<p>Besides, how we deal with these first hints may set the tone for how we  
<br>
deal with the real deal.  That's why we're here, right?  It's not just the  
<br>
fact that far out stuff is coming up-- we always knew it was coming-- it's  
<br>
that it's become obvious that it's coming up really fucking fast.  So  
<br>
we're going to try to figure it out.  Quickly.  Practically.  We need to  
<br>
get some traction on it.
<br>
<p>Time is changing, so we may have to alter our perimeter.  Soon, looking  
<br>
ahead five minutes will be as hard as looking ahead 500 years used to be.   
<br>
It's already become very fuzzy looking into just the next decade.
<br>
<p><p>Meanwhile back at the ranch, nobody has any clue what they're getting  
<br>
into.  Normal people are still integrating the fact that Yahoogroups  
<br>
exists.  To us, Yahoogroups is just a toy; it's a baby step or two ahead  
<br>
of majordomo (and not as friendly).  To them, it's some weird new useful  
<br>
thing that magically appeared in the universe.  Hardly anyone over a  
<br>
certain age really groks the concept that the internet knows more about  
<br>
every subject than any library ever used to know; a relative of my  
<br>
husband's assumed that Google was a pay service and thinks that  
<br>
downloading is illegal.  What are these people going to do with the powers  
<br>
they are being given??  It's looking like it's going to be shepherds and  
<br>
sheep, unless those bountiful technology curves somehow supply us with  
<br>
some way of quickly getting comprehension into these brains.
<br>
<p>So the question of how societies go about integrating these technologies  
<br>
may end up being even more essential than the technologies themselves.   
<br>
The personal power of information technology means that people matter.   
<br>
Crazy ignorant confused normal people are going to write the script for  
<br>
how this shit goes down.
<br>
<p>The Pentagon is, in all seriousness, considering the military applications.
