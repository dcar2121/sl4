</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that this would be a big project, but I believe it would
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems that they could study, and by having a large number of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacking it from different angles, progress would be rapid.
</em><br>
<p>I would be interested to hear the details of what you have in mind.
<br>
What is the scope of this? Do you conceive it as integrating with
<br>
existing langauges? IDEs? Will it be tied to a single programming
<br>
language, or will different modules communicate through some RPC
<br>
mechanism? Exactly what automation are you after as far as &quot;allow[ing]
<br>
rapid construction of large numbers of different systems&quot;? As I see
<br>
it, one way to do this is to define a number of different roles
<br>
mediated by strict interfaces, which can be filled by various
<br>
implementations of modules. The software you propose might automate
<br>
the process of trying different combinations of modules with various
<br>
parameters modulated over the course of a number of tests gauging some
<br>
aspect of effectiveness. But, besides writing the modules and
<br>
designing the interfaces between them, that's the work of a few shell
<br>
scripts. The other part is what takes the serious effort. So it seems
<br>
likely that you have something broader in mind?
<br>
<p>Myself, I think the biggest payoff in terms of programmer productivity
<br>
is in going with a language that offers quick turnaround, easy
<br>
experimentation, and preferrably a very flexible IDE, higher-level
<br>
functions, structural code macros, with a solid compiler. (Common Lisp
<br>
with a nicer IDE, in other words.) Any additional time invested in
<br>
extending the development environment should go into general-purpose
<br>
or moderately domain-specific features, perhaps a few editor
<br>
extensions. There are plenty of environments that offer the extension
<br>
opportunities like this that make recreating syntax highlighters and
<br>
build management unnecessary, whatever one's end goals are.
<br>
<p>But above this level, I'm not sure exactly what features would be both
<br>
general enough and useful enough to be used by more than one or two AI
<br>
projects. I think perhaps what Loosemoore believes (and correct me if
<br>
I'm wrong) is that there's a moderately large search space of
<br>
different modular frameworks and combinations module implementations
<br>
within a framework in which we'll soonest find an AGI, a search space
<br>
large enough to require many different projects to cover it, and so
<br>
having a tool that assists in this approach will help researchers to
<br>
more easily collaborate. Now, with this understanding, Loosemore's
<br>
idea is really more of an issue with a common standard for module
<br>
interfaces plus some testing tools than it is lots of new development
<br>
environments. It would facilitate or enable collaboration between
<br>
different projects using the same environment, which environment
<br>
presupposes the same general approach to AI development (and the same
<br>
specific approach to a degree).
