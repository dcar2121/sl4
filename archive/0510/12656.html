</em><br>
<p>Why? What fundamental reason for there is this as long as the
<br>
informational/computational constraints are met? A digital sentient
<br>
AI can be losslessly moved from hardware to hardware and duplicated,
<br>
does a minute amount of quantum information loss for analogue
<br>
substrates, or none at all if the transfer is incremental in certain
<br>
ways, make any difference?
<br>
<p>As far as I can see this is a case of human intution about people
<br>
and physical objects being misapplied (indeed, creating the wrong
<br>
mindset to proceed from) to a reality that is actually quite remote
<br>
from the everyday experience of a paleolithic human. This isn't
<br>
uncommon in science and is particularly common in cognitive science,
<br>
yet somehow people still expect their intuitive notions about
<br>
consiousness to be more accurate than their intuitive notions
<br>
about biology or cosmology. They aren't - they're worse, because
<br>
evolution expended a lot more optimisation pressure on producing
<br>
fitness-generating but reflectively inconsistent and objectively
<br>
wrong cognitive structre here. The results of trying to figure out
<br>
this mess, proceeding from the false assumption that it's absolute
<br>
truth that just needs to be formalised somehow, has historically
<br>
constituted the majort portion of what we call philosophy. How this
<br>
persists after so many cognitive science experiments have shown
<br>
conscious experience to be an unreliable and nonunitary post-hoc
<br>
confabulation I'm not sure. Ironically one of the possibilities
<br>
opened by the Singularity may well be for humans to redesign our
<br>
actual cognitive architecture to more closely resemble the cognitive
<br>
architecture suggested by our reflective intuitions (Egan's
<br>
excellent 'Schild's Ladder' had an amusing example of this).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The abstract thought experiments equating identical patterns with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical identities are neat, but fall apart as soon as physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is invoked. In both scenarios below, your upload has a separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ontological existence.
</em><br>
<p>You have yet to establish either the ontological primitiveness of
<br>
consciousness or how it maps onto physics. For example, you have
<br>
yet to establish a link between time-space co-ordinates or substrate
<br>
in general and 'youness'; if the cognition is similar enough to
<br>
produce indistinguishable objective and subjective results, how are
<br>
any other factors going to make any difference to the identity of
<br>
the conscious entity?
