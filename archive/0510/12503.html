</em><br>
<em>&gt; You do not speak for the entire SL4 list, unless or until I (at least)
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As I said.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as I am concerned, the widespread (is it really widespread?) SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption that &quot;strictly humanoid intelligence would not likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly ...[etc.]&quot;
</em><br>
<p>It's a position, though perhaps not an assumption, held by SIAI; and
<br>
as far as the views and research of the SIAI are one of the main
<br>
topics of this list, and this list is owned by a founding member of
<br>
that organization, the assumption can be said to be widespread within
<br>
the context of this list. But it's most certainly not widespread among
<br>
AI researchers as a whole, with yourself as a good example case. I
<br>
think Ben Goertzel also holds that the position goes too far, and Phil
<br>
Goetz doubts the very idea of an AI driven singularity, IIRC (and I
<br>
may not). Both of these people are major contributors to this list,
<br>
and real AI researchers. (I'm not an AI researcher, I program bank
<br>
software.) So there's certainly a diversity of opinions.
<br>
<p>One of the goals of the SIAI is to increase awareness and respect in
<br>
the AI community at large about the dangers of recursive
<br>
self-improvement with no prior planning. Of course, part of this is
<br>
convincing people it's a danger to be taken seriously. If the past is
<br>
any evidence, (and if I understand it well enough,) this hasn't really
<br>
met with much success yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; is based on a puerile understanding of, and contempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of, the mechanics of human intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>We've had some threads on this, sure, but the SIAI position has by no
<br>
means been established. I wonder what kind of discussion would be
<br>
necessary to really establish this one way or the other. I wasn't
<br>
around for the discussions with Goertzel about this issue.
