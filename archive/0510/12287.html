<br>
<p>One last thing: The shape of emergence of computer intelligence is not  
<br>
going to be anything like our intuitions that we draw from the emergence  of 
<br>
biological intelligence.  Our biological intelligence emerged very  slowly 
<br>
by incremental changes, methodically exploring not the whole space  of 
<br>
what's possible to compute, but rather the space of what computations  are 
<br>
sufficient to keep a monkey alive long enough to fuck.  Electronic  
<br>
intelligence is not going to emerge gradually through generations of whole  
<br>
cohesive system.  It's not a baby.
<br>
<p>What the new intelligence is going to do is totally blast the roof off of  
<br>
one domain after another.  They beat us first at adding numbers; they  
<br>
completely utterly crushed us.  They didn't rest on their laurels, though;  
<br>
they crush us more &amp; more at adding numbers every year.  They got better  
<br>
than us at Chess, at first just barely, but they have gotten better every  
<br>
year (faster, in fact, than the rate of hardware advances alone).  Voice  
<br>
recognition software is on track to become truly fluid over the next few  
<br>
years, but it will not stop there; computers will be able to make out a  
<br>
whisper from across the room, pick out one voice out of a chattering crowd  
<br>
of thousands, understand the world's heaviest Scottish accent, etc.  They  
<br>
will be able to record every conversation they hear and index it against  
<br>
every other conversation they have ever heard.  They'll know exactly when  
<br>
the last time they heard the word &quot;mulberry&quot; was.
<br>
<p>On one side of the transition there are just humans who think in human  
<br>
ways, and on the other side is the impossible-to-conceive strangeness of  
<br>
true intelligence.  What's interesting is what's inbetween; it's not, as  
<br>
you might first guess, a being with intelligence which is uniformly  
<br>
improved to half way between the Human and Power levels.  Instead what's  
<br>
between the two is a creature who has half of the Powers-- who can compute  
<br>
fractals instantly, record sounds and play them back, use Bayesian spam  
<br>
filters, communicate verbally over continental spans, access information  
<br>
about essentially any subject on a moment's notice, etc-- a creature  trying 
<br>
to survive an astounding and unexpected metamorphosis, by which I  mean, of 
<br>
course, us.
<br>
<p>*****
<br>
<p><p>As far as computer intelligence goes, it appears to me you are drastically 
<br>
underestimating the impact. (Yes, the rabbit hole goes much much deeper, in 
<br>
fact- its something of black hole, or ... *cough* Singularity... hehe).
<br>
<p>The fact that an intelligence is on a computer is much more than just 
<br>
computer abilities being &quot;added on&quot; to human abilities. It isn't just 
<br>
human+computer, but human^computer. Each bit of computer ability that is 
<br>
added, also totally overhauls and modifies the human side. Intuitive 
<br>
algorithms (like tying your shoe) could be modified to have independent 
<br>
awareness (ie. information searching, processing, intelligent analyzing, 
<br>
etc). You could transfer yourself into an &quot;accelerated simulation&quot; where 
<br>
every 24 hours of subjective time is equal to a nanosecond- thus living 
<br>
multiple lifetimes in the span of one second. Matrix-uploading of knowledge 
<br>
will be possible. You could spend an entire simulated lifetime constructing 
<br>
a single email, no harm no problem- especially because you could modifty 
<br>
yourself to not get bored by the incredibly long journeys. Every tiny piece 
<br>
of &quot;real-time&quot; empirical observation could be analyzed in a million 
<br>
different ways for years at a time, and compared and analyzed against the 
<br>
entirety of public human knowledge- all in less than a second- in fact, all 
<br>
in less than one *subjective* second, because the entire process could be 
<br>
both *really* intelligent and automated on a PURELY intuitive level.
<br>
<p>Try to imagine a real-time conversation between two people with these 
<br>
faculties, Alice, and you will see humans have barely even stuck their toe 
<br>
into the rabbit hole.
