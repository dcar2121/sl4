To clarify, my position here is that copying the quantum states or perhaps even a coarser resloution is sufficient to engineer sentience, regardless if one models it from an existing being or not.  But even copying an original mind's brain states down to a Planck length resolution is insufficient to affect personal identity.  The latter requires a deeper engineering expertise.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Atoms in our brains naturally being recycled in replaced do not affect identity
<br>
because there is more to configuration of matter/energy than knowing 4D atom co-ordinates.  The fields and forces that give rise to atoms comprising a mind must also be replicated for uploading to work.  Perhaps if an entire mind could be quantum-entangled with an uploaded mind...  Every mass/energy component in your brain is connected in many different ways to a whole bunch of other non-local mass energy components in the universe.  I know the last sentence sounds like new-age crap.

<p>Determine the velocity and location of every molecule in a neuron to the
<br>
accuracy Hinesburg allows and then use that information to make a
<br>
duplicate neuron, and then snap it into place in a flash. Actually
<br>
something very much like that happens every day of our lives as the
<br>
atoms in out brains are constantly being recycled.
