<p><p>The whole concept seems a little backwards to me.  It seems like it's  
<br>
predicated on the idea that once we get to such a level of technology,  
<br>
we're still going to be mostly biological intelligences and we're going to  
<br>
continue to identify ourselves primarily, if not entirely, with our meat.
<br>
<p>Consider first of all that long before we have the technology for  
<br>
uploading, we are going to have the technology to replace particular  
<br>
regions of the brain with equivalent (&amp;/or better &amp;/or radically  
<br>
different) electronic components.  At first of course (&amp; this has already  
<br>
started on a primitive level) this will be sold as a &quot;treatment&quot; for  
<br>
&quot;diseases.&quot;  When you get old &amp; your hearing starts to go they'll replace  
<br>
your auditory system; at first it'll be a crude replacement, then it'll be  
<br>
comparable to a healthy brain's system, &amp; then it will become dramatically  
<br>
superior.
<br>
<p>Suppose, theoretically, that you were going to upload someone who already  
<br>
had their native auditory system replaced with an electronic version.   
<br>
Uploading that part would then consist of a file copy.  (I'm not  
<br>
suggesting that that lowers the difficulty of uploading the rest of the  
<br>
brain; I'm just trying to get us into a new frame.)
<br>
<p>Long before we have the ability to upload, we'll have the ability to  
<br>
replace even higher/inner parts of the brain.  Electronic brain modules  
<br>
will be sold as &quot;treatments&quot; for people with strokes, for instance.  The  
<br>
result will be people who are very deeply jacked in.  It's inevitable that  
<br>
the new parts we install will have externally modifiable software; long  
<br>
before anyone is fully uploaded we'll have a planet full of people  
<br>
&quot;messing&quot; with themselves.
<br>
<p>Take another angle.  A large part of what makes a person unique is their  
<br>
memories.  Very soon (already, depending on how you look at it) our  
<br>
electronic memories of our life will be vastly more comprehensive and  
<br>
accurate than our meat memories.  It will become increasingly arbitrary to  
<br>
identify ourselves more with the memories that our meat presents to us  
<br>
than with those that our computers do.  If we're honest, in fact, it will  
<br>
be impossible to escape the fact that meat memory is vague, shifty, &amp;  
<br>
usually wrong; electronic memory will show it up continuously &amp;  
<br>
dramatically once it gets to the level of &quot;Computer, show me what I was  
<br>
doing at 2:16 PM on October 24th, 2005.&quot;
<br>
<p>The electronic parts of us (such as our personal computer hard drives) are  
<br>
presently rather static, which lends strength to the intuition that they  
<br>
are &quot;dead.&quot;  This has been slowly ending for a long time.  The predictions  
<br>
that we would have electronic &quot;agents&quot; which would go out and search for  
<br>
news articles that interest us have in fact come to pass.  They're  
<br>
tremendously dumb, of course, but that's not going to last.  More and more  
<br>
intelligence will be embedded in the systems around us, and we will  
<br>
emotionally feel ourselves to be deeply interrelated with that  
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>We are going to have some interesting ghosts.  Ghosts is what I call the  
<br>
machine part of a human-computer intelligence after the human part dies.   
<br>
If I were to die today, my ghost wouldn't do anything very interesting; it  
<br>
would continue to collect and sort my email for me, find news articles I  
<br>
might be interested in, change my desktop background to random pictures,  
<br>
download my podcasts, etc.  Over the next few years, however, ghosts will  
<br>
become increasingly autonomous.  They'll still be useless; they won't hold  
<br>
up conversations; they'll have their whole purpose structured around  
<br>
pleasing a central meat processor who no longer exists to care; but  
<br>
they'll do more &amp; more stuff on their own, setting their own priorities &amp;  
<br>
keeping themselves busy without outside encouragement.
<br>
<p>We'll have to seriously consider: Is it ethical to shut down a ghost?  The  
<br>
user might have started a program with instructions that will keep it busy  
<br>
for a year.  Intentional acts won't lose all of their intelligence just  
<br>
because they've lost their user.  I believe that the locus of selfhood  
<br>
will start to feel a bit of drift.
<br>
<p>Most people identify themselves pretty strongly with their brain as a  
<br>
whole, but not so much with each individual module.  Who's to say that we  
<br>
won't &quot;upload&quot; by simply replacing parts that seem too small to be &quot;me&quot;  
<br>
until there's no meat left?
<br>
<p>I think uploading sounds like a fun idea, but I think it will come on the  
<br>
back side of the curve.  Long before then we will be personally joining  
<br>
with vast intelligences.  So who knows if it will even make the same sort  
<br>
of sense to us by the time it becomes possible.
