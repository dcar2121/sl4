<p>Yes. Moravec's procedure is the only safe way to transfer a mind between

substrates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clearly we recognize that by removing the entire brain and simply

</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At the other extreme, it seems intuitively obvious that sequential

</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So at what point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between these two extremes to do we reach a threshold at which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity is conserved or lost?
</em><br>
<p>The answer depends on what we mean by &quot;identity&quot;. If by &quot;identity&quot; we mean 
<br>
brain structure, then identity should be conserved in both cases. But in the 
<br>
first scenario we intuitively recognize that the original person is dead, 
<br>
meaning, we suspect that successful uploading must involve more than just 
<br>
copying brain structure.
<br>
<p>The word &quot;identity&quot; is, in fact, the source of the confusion. When people 
<br>
start analyzing identity and ways to preserve it during uploading they tend 
<br>
to focus on brain structure and forget something blindingly obvious and 
<br>
trivial which is that the purpose of uploading is not only to preserve 
<br>
identity, but, first and foremost, to preserve human life.
<br>
<p>In general terms, human life is a mind-producing activity of matter in 
<br>
space-time. It follows that in order for uploading to preserve life the 
<br>
procedure must be performed in a way that preserves mind-producing 
<br>
*activity* of matter (and not just brain structure).
<br>
<p>With that in mind, if we replace the word &quot;identity&quot; with &quot;life and 
<br>
identity/brain structure&quot; it should be obvious why the first scenario leads 
<br>
to unsuccessful uploading (death of the original) while the second preserves 
<br>
both life and identity/brain structure of the original.
<br>
<p>The threshold in this case isn't the preserved percentage of the original 
<br>
brain structure but whether the whole system comprised of old and new 
<br>
substrate lost, at any point, the potential to generate single 
<br>
mind-producing activity of matter in space-time. In the first case, the 
<br>
system lost that potential (died) while, in the second case, that potential 
<br>
existed at all times during the transfer.
