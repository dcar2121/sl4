<p><p>INTRODUCTION
<br>
<p>My name is Mungojelly.  I've never posted here before.  I spent all day  
<br>
writing this.  If you care to know more about me, my main homepage is  
<br>
<a href="http://beautywood.org/mungojelly">http://beautywood.org/mungojelly</a>
<br>
<p><p>SUMMARY OF THIS POST
<br>
<p>There seems to be a general assumption by the Singularitarian community  
<br>
that a single human brain is the most relevant level at which to consider  
<br>
human intelligence.  I disagree; it's my opinion that the collective  
<br>
intelligence of human groups is more relevant both to the past and future  
<br>
of intelligence.  Various ideas follow from this slightly altered  
<br>
perspective, for instance that technologies are already being included as  
<br>
participants in social networks and are &quot;rewiring&quot; large parts of society.
<br>
<p>I then go on to discuss my theories about what it's like for human and  
<br>
computer intelligences to cooperate/combine, and how that process is  
<br>
actually playing itself out in our society.
<br>
<p><p>INDIVIDUAL VS COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
<br>
<p>The apparent intelligence of individual humans is mostly an illusion.   
<br>
Even the most brilliant of humans are lucky to have a single truly  
<br>
original and useful idea in the course of a day.  Most of our appearance  
<br>
of intelligence comes from our ability to integrate, apply and transmit  
<br>
ideas that other people have already thought of.
<br>
<p>The intelligence of humanity, that intelligence which has been rapidly  
<br>
discovering the nature of our world, is not of course an illusion.  The  
<br>
illusion is that any particular individual human head is capable of  
<br>
containing or understanding any substantial portion of that collective  
<br>
knowledge.  We each help to maintain that illusion, by skillfully applying  
<br>
(and often over-applying) those very few facts out of the immense  
<br>
ever-growing library of human knowledge which we have been personally able  
<br>
to comprehend.
<br>
<p>In fact, the human brain is only very minimally different from that of  
<br>
other primates.  It's my belief that these small differences do not (as is  
<br>
often suggested these days) consist of some sort of magic spark which  
<br>
trips the circuit that flips a brain into having magical abilities like  
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;consciousness.&quot;  It's my belief, rather, that  
<br>
individual human beings are in their actual mental qualities (as well as  
<br>
their genetics and so forth) pretty much the same as other primates:  
<br>
playful, highly social (and sexual), capable of picking up tricks from  
<br>
those around them and using tools to accomplish tasks, but not able to  
<br>
routinely have any sort of great insight into how the world works or to  
<br>
routinely make creative inventive leaps.
<br>
<p>The way that we are different is that we communicate.  One way to look at  
<br>
this difference is as an amplifier for the minimal intelligence that  
<br>
already exists; you may still have that flash of inspiration once in a  
<br>
very great while, but when you have it you can immediately spread the  
<br>
fruits to an entire society.  Another way of looking at it is to see a  
<br>
group of verbally interacting humans as a larger unit, as a sort of  
<br>
virtual computer layered over the substrate of individual thought.
<br>
<p>Human societies routinely do complex mental tasks by dividing them between  
<br>
a large number of individuals.  This is a preexisting form of &quot;superhuman  
<br>
intelligence,&quot; if by superhuman you mean exceeding the capacity of a  
<br>
single human brain.  Obviously we have not explored every possible way of  
<br>
organizing group thought (and new possibilities for how to do so are  
<br>
coming online so quickly they're hardly news anymore), but the history of  
<br>
human societies is still a useful reservoir of collective knowledge about  
<br>
what larger-than-human thought will/does look like.
<br>
<p><p>TECHNOLOGY REWIRES COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From this stance of seeing human intelligence as primarily a collective  
<br>
rather than an individual undertaking, we can ask different questions  
<br>
about what the future shape of technological intelligence is going to look  
<br>
like.  For instance, when asking about the amplification of the  
<br>
intelligence of a particular individual human, we might wonder about how  
<br>
we could go about setting up more direct communication between computers  
<br>
and neurons.  The analogous questions on a group level would be about  
<br>
fitting computers into the social landscape, so their contributions can be  
<br>
integrated and accepted by others.
<br>
<p>Because intelligence is an emergent quality in human groups, it is  
<br>
susceptible in dramatic and (to us so far) unpredictable ways to  
<br>
alterations in the patterns of human society.  For a number of decades  
<br>
vast numbers of humans have been jacked in very deeply to mass media;  
<br>
nobody really knows what the consequences have been.  For a few decades,  
<br>
large numbers of people have been forming virtual communities around  
<br>
subject areas on the net (like this mailing list), collectively thinking  
<br>
about various subjects in ways that they have never been thought about  
<br>
before; nobody knows the consequences.  Human societies are being deeply  
<br>
rewired, and (because this is a level of cognition which is more difficult  
<br>
for us to understand due to its complexity and more-than-us-ness) the  
<br>
whole thing seems rather subtle and nebulous to us.  The transition is  
<br>
underway, though, whether we are carefully considering it or not.
<br>
<p><p>YAHOOGROUPS, FOR EXAMPLE
<br>
<p>Here's a common social scenario from the beginning of this strange new  
<br>
century.  I was at a meeting recently of men and women from the U.S. in  
<br>
their twenties.  All were reasonably computer literate (they all have  
<br>
email addresses) but none, save myself, were Singularitarians or hackers  
<br>
or otherwise familiar with how deep the rabbit hole goes.  They set up a  
<br>
Yahoo group to coordinate the social network they were attempting to  
<br>
create.  The one person (save myself) who was competent to create &amp;  
<br>
administer a Yahoo group expounded briefly on the virtues of the software,  
<br>
&amp; particularly the calendar features.  Someone asked a question about  
<br>
receiving email vs reading on the web, and it was clarified that Yahoo  
<br>
allows you to do either.  An informal consensus was reached to use a Yahoo  
<br>
group as a collective communications tool.
<br>
<p>The intelligence of the Yahoogroups software is in many ways quite  
<br>
minimal.  On the face of it, therefore, one might expect that it would  
<br>
have a proportionally small effect upon the human societies into which it  
<br>
is integrating.  One way to understand why this may not be true is to  
<br>
replace the question &quot;what is the greatest intelligence which this  
<br>
software is capable of replacing&quot; with &quot;what is the actual process that  
<br>
this new intelligence is replacing and how do they compare.&quot;
<br>
<p>The task of keeping a calendar and reminding a list of people when events  
<br>
are coming up on it is a task which requires minimal intelligence; it  
<br>
takes far less than one human brain worth of smarts to do the job.  In the  
<br>
real world, however, there have never before been intelligent calendar  
<br>
keeping agents; the only way to accomplish the task has been  
<br>
(metaphorically speaking) to run a sort of virtual calendar computer on a  
<br>
human brain.  Human brains are marvellous objects, but calendar keeping is  
<br>
not at all their strong point.  Without Yahoo's contribution to the  
<br>
intelligence pool of this group, the closest they would have been able to  
<br>
come would have been to assign a person to be the calendar keeper; besides  
<br>
being slow and error prone, the person assigned to that job would probably  
<br>
find it very tedious.
<br>
<p>There's two sides to that fact.  One is the obvious conclusion, that  
<br>
assigning an agent to the (difficult for humans) task of keeping track of  
<br>
when events are scheduled allows for a whole human intelligence to be  
<br>
freed from rather a lot of work.  A small input of intelligence, given the  
<br>
right context, can have an amplified output once you get to the level of  
<br>
actual productive thought.  The flipside is a set of consequences that are  
<br>
rather more difficult to comprehend; the truth is that in the absence of  
<br>
Yahoo's calendrical competence, since this is an unfunded voluntary  
<br>
association it's quite possible (even likely) that no human calendar  
<br>
keeper would have been assigned at all.  Meetings would have been attended  
<br>
by whoever happened to remember; indeed, in previous centuries groups with  
<br>
regular meetings were simply much more difficult to organize than they are  
<br>
today.  This is changing fundamental qualities of society itself.
<br>
<p><p>INTEGRATION IS SUPERHUMAN INTELLIGENCE
<br>
<p>Superhuman intelligence is a human with a calculator.  If you come up to  
<br>
me and I'm holding a calculator, I am capable of doing all of the tasks  
<br>
which an unaided human intelligence is capable of, plus those that a  
<br>
calculator is capable of, plus (most interestingly) those tasks which a  
<br>
combined human-calculator intelligence is capable of (for instance  
<br>
balancing a checkbook).
<br>
<p>I am not coming from the perspective of someone who is in denial and wants  
<br>
to minimize the strangeness of superhuman intelligence.  I am coming at it  
<br>
&nbsp;from the other side; I am trying to emphasize the strangeness of what's  
<br>
already happening, of how far down the rabbit hole we have already gone.   
<br>
Handheld calculators, in spite of the fact that we have grown bored of  
<br>
them, are in no way normal business-as-usual for the human species.  Our  
<br>
difficult social process of integration with handheld calculators is now  
<br>
under a very tall layered pile of new intelligences which have found  
<br>
places in human society.  The whole thing is wriggling; it's alive.
<br>
<p>I don't think this process of integration can be as prettily charted as  
<br>
are the trends in computing power.  For one thing they are very  
<br>
qualitative, and so any notion of a &quot;direction of progress&quot; would have to  
<br>
be very subjectively defined.  (Can the intense popular integration with  
<br>
television sets be considered intellectual progress?  What are the social  
<br>
functions of Tickle Me Elmo?)  Nevertheless, I feel from my personal  
<br>
experience that there is a trend towards greater social integration  
<br>
between humans and computers, and I have some guesses as to the overall  
<br>
shape of that trend.
<br>
<p>One dramatic feature of the trend is that younger generations tend to be  
<br>
substantially more integrated with the newest technologies than older  
<br>
generations.  (Somewhere a baby is playing right now with the flash drive  
<br>
on her mom's keychain, and imprinting far deeper than us the notion of  
<br>
living in a world with ubiquitous mass storage.)  This trend has been  
<br>
widely noticed, but I'll highlight one counterintuitive consequence that I  
<br>
believe follows from it: As technology embodies more intelligence, the  
<br>
young will increasingly come to know more (in many different senses) than  
<br>
the old.
<br>
<p>The other observation I've been making on a gut level about this trend  
<br>
towards increased social integration between humans and computers is that  
<br>
the bottleneck is not technological.  It's easy for me (or for anyone) to  
<br>
think of ways that people could use computers more intimately, but haven't  
<br>
chosen to.  The fantastic meteoric rise of computing power translates  
<br>
itself into new social forms only at a much smaller rate.  Everyone who  
<br>
buys a new computer today is buying a digital sound studio, a digital  
<br>
image studio, a powerful text analysis tool, the capacity to store a  
<br>
library worth of text, a graphing calculator capable of instantly drawing  
<br>
all kinds of beautiful fractals &amp; other complex systems, a sort of digital  
<br>
aquarium capable of supporting evolving replicating virtual beings, a  
<br>
formidable chess opponent, etc, &amp; they'll probably just use it to word  
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>It's possible to imagine a society in which no one would think to do  
<br>
anything except word process.  Computers would get more powerful, &amp; no one  
<br>
would be able to think of anything more powerful they wanted to do, so  
<br>
chips would be standardized and become extraordinarily cheap and that's  
<br>
it.  Our society isn't quite like that-- we're curious-- but our curiosity  
<br>
is still tremendously counterbalanced with conservatism and caution.
<br>
<p><p>INTEGRATION COMES IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR
<br>
<p>The next step in this line of reasoning is as follows:
<br>
<p>If much more integration is possible than actual with current levels of  
<br>
technology, that is if people consciously resist deep integration between  
<br>
themselves and a computer, then integration will continue (assuming that  
<br>
it satisfies unconscious needs, or otherwise has the memetic hooks to  
<br>
succeed) but as inobtrusively, unremarkably, &amp; usually as possible.
<br>
<p>My feeling of the state of the world today is that we have various devices  
<br>
almost bursting at the seams, desperately trying to burst out of the nice  
<br>
safe lines that keep them each to a restricted, tool-like role (phone,  
<br>
camera, radio, television, watch, clock, exercise machine).  My cell phone  
<br>
knows my schedule; watches know the phase of the moon; my new iPod can  
<br>
show photos for some reason.  Tremendous amounts of intelligence can be  
<br>
embedded in things without their becoming threatening, as long as the end  
<br>
result seems &quot;natural&quot; to a user.  They don't realize they're talking to  
<br>
increasingly intelligent AIs; they just know that search results seem more  
<br>
useful than they used to, or that computers can recognize voices better  
<br>
than they used to.  To an end user (even a well informed one) it just  
<br>
isn't that shocking for computers to recognize the human voice; rather,  
<br>
it's seemed odd the past few decades that they haven't been able to.   
<br>
Recognizing what someone says seems easy enough subjectively.
<br>
<p>Each person subjectively examines what it's like to think, and finds that  
<br>
it consists of various easy tasks (recognizing what someone says, adding  
<br>
one plus one, etc) and also various harder tasks.  The hard tasks are what  
<br>
make up the bulk of what we worry about.  It seems to a naive person  
<br>
therefore that if you were going to go about building an AI, you would  
<br>
find it easy to blow through the simple stuff like being able to talk, and  
<br>
then you would hit a very difficult wall when it came to harder stuff,  
<br>
like being conscious of your own emotions.  So it's not very threatening  
<br>
if computers can do things like pick out a voice from a crowd-- &quot;So what?   
<br>
That's not very hard anyway, is it?!&quot;
<br>
<p>So yes I do think that society will be blind-sided by AI.  People are  
<br>
going to have articles explaining why AI is impossible automatically  
<br>
delivered to them based on their click history, and they will read them  
<br>
and enjoy them.  That's not necessarily a limiting factor-- nobody planned  
<br>
out the transition to multicellular life and that went OK-- but it's going  
<br>
to make the whole shape of things really weird.  &quot;Hyperintelligent  
<br>
toasters&quot; type of weird.
<br>
<p><p>ONE LAST THING: RAISING THE ROOF
<br>
<p>One last thing: The shape of emergence of computer intelligence is not  
<br>
going to be anything like our intuitions that we draw from the emergence  
<br>
of biological intelligence.  Our biological intelligence emerged very  
<br>
slowly by incremental changes, methodically exploring not the whole space  
<br>
of what's possible to compute, but rather the space of what computations  
<br>
are sufficient to keep a monkey alive long enough to fuck.  Electronic  
<br>
intelligence is not going to emerge gradually through generations of whole  
<br>
cohesive system.  It's not a baby.
<br>
<p>What the new intelligence is going to do is totally blast the roof off of  
<br>
one domain after another.  They beat us first at adding numbers; they  
<br>
completely utterly crushed us.  They didn't rest on their laurels, though;  
<br>
they crush us more &amp; more at adding numbers every year.  They got better  
<br>
than us at Chess, at first just barely, but they have gotten better every  
<br>
year (faster, in fact, than the rate of hardware advances alone).  Voice  
<br>
recognition software is on track to become truly fluid over the next few  
<br>
years, but it will not stop there; computers will be able to make out a  
<br>
whisper from across the room, pick out one voice out of a chattering crowd  
<br>
of thousands, understand the world's heaviest Scottish accent, etc.  They  
<br>
will be able to record every conversation they hear and index it against  
<br>
every other conversation they have ever heard.  They'll know exactly when  
<br>
the last time they heard the word &quot;mulberry&quot; was.
<br>
<p>On one side of the transition there are just humans who think in human  
<br>
ways, and on the other side is the impossible-to-conceive strangeness of  
<br>
true intelligence.  What's interesting is what's inbetween; it's not, as  
<br>
you might first guess, a being with intelligence which is uniformly  
<br>
improved to half way between the Human and Power levels.  Instead what's  
<br>
between the two is a creature who has half of the Powers-- who can compute  
<br>
fractals instantly, record sounds and play them back, use Bayesian spam  
<br>
filters, communicate verbally over continental spans, access information  
<br>
about essentially any subject on a moment's notice, etc-- a creature  
<br>
trying to survive an astounding and unexpected metamorphosis, by which I  
<br>
mean, of course, us.
<br>
<p><p>CONCLUSION AND SIGNATURE
<br>
<p>Those are my thoughts so far.  Criticisms are, of course, welcomed.
