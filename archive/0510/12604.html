Russell,
<br>
<p>Why did you stop your analysis there?????
<br>
<p>Why, after I asked you to take that section as a premise, so I could 
<br>
make my argument, did you stop half way through and (once again) start 
<br>
criticising the wrong thing?  What you criticised, right down the bottom 
<br>
there, at the end of this post, was something so general it covered a 
<br>
vast multitude of different cognitive systems.  THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS 
<br>
MEANT TO DO.  It was meant to be general, so why blast it for not being 
<br>
specific enough???!!!!
<br>
<p>Isn't that exactly what I meant by not paying attention to my point?
<br>
<p>So let me see if I have got this right......
<br>
<p>I complain that the responses are coming from people who are not paying 
<br>
attention to the point I am making.
<br>
<p>You complain back at me that, no, it is just that I am not being clear 
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>And then you go and do what you just did ...... stopping halfway through 
<br>
the argument, firing off senseless criticisms at a section that I 
<br>
labelled &quot;treat this as a hypothetical&quot;?   And along the way, making 
<br>
comments like:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Seriously, this is the sort of thing I mean. Everyone agrees that of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; course cognitive systems must consist of a large number of elements -
</em><br>
<em> &gt; what else could they be?
</em><br>
<p>Everyone was *supposed* to agree with that characterization!  You were 
<br>
supposed to accept that as our common ground and go on to the point of 
<br>
the argument, not make cheap remarks about it.
<br>
<p><p><p>Richard Loosemore
<br>
<p><p>P.S. And if you have read &quot;a big stack of Santa Fe's technical papers&quot;, 
<br>
how would you like to do us all a favor and summarize the complex 
<br>
systems argument that appears at the end of my post in your own words, 
<br>
so we can get a second perspective on it?  Explain to the group, if you 
<br>
would, the way in which low level mechanisms can become disconnected 
<br>
from high level regularities.  Darned if I can say the words to make 
<br>
anyone understand that point, so maybe you will have better luck.  Just 
<br>
a few illustrations of the effect would do.

<em>&gt;     Everyone wants to see a draft specification.  Under other circumstances
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     this might be understandable, but if nobody understands my *reason* for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     would be a waste of time for me to lay out the spec, because it would be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;     people did completely get the motivation for the environment, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     details would be much less important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's the other way around; nobody will understand the reasons _until_ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you give the details. If you don't want to, okay; if you do choose to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; write up a draft spec, I'll try to evaluate it against your motives for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I am distressed, because the common thread through all the replies so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     far has been an almost total miscomprehension of the basic reason why I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     suggested the environment.  And this is not entirely my fault, because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     have looked back over my writing and I see that the information was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     clearly stated in the posts.  I suspect that many people have too
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     time to do more than skim-read the posts on this list, and as a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     they get incredibly superficial ideas about what was said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, that's not the reason. The fault is the inadequacy of the language. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may have clearly stated your points by _your_ understanding of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms you used, but that doesn't communicate them to anyone else. Think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it: Michael Wilson had basically the same complaint with you as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have with him; were you just skim-reading his posts? You could say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he's being stupid or ignorant, but he's a pretty sharp guy and there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't a lot of people in the world who know more about this stuff than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he does; and I will immodestly claim the same description applies to me; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and neither of us really understand what you're getting at. I will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggest you should at least acknowledge the plausibility of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis that the problem is that the language just isn't up to the job.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I am going to split this message at this point, because I am getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     close to the end of my tether. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry to hear that, but I'll observe that most of what you've been doing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so far is arguing with the SIAI guys in a debate where both sides are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just talking past each other due to the inadequacy of the language used. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that reflects on the chances of success using a different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     For anyone who reads the below explanation and still finds no spark of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     understanding, I say this:  go do some reading.  Read enough about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     world of complex systems to have a good solid background, then come back
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and see if this makes sense.  Either that, or go visit with the folks at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Santa Fe, or bring those folks in on the discussion.  I am really not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     going to beat my head against this any more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did that, years ago, everything from popular science writing to a big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stack of Santa Fe's technical papers. Was fun bedtime reading, but not a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great deal of concrete relevance to AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     First, I need to ask you to accept one hypothetical... you're going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     have to work with me here and not argue against this point, just accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     it as a &quot;what if&quot;.  Agreed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Here is the hypothetical.  Imagine that cognitive systems consist of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     large number of &quot;elements&quot; which are the atoms of knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     representation (an element represents a thing in the world, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;thing&quot; can be concrete or abstract, a noun-like thing or an action or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     process .... anything whatsoever).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And here was me thinking intelligence was based on an indivisible, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ineffable soul :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, this is the sort of thing I mean. Everyone agrees that of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course cognitive systems must consist of a large number of elements - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what else could they be? (At least everyone on SL4; I doubt anyone who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes in the ineffability of the soul will have bothered to read this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Presumably you mean something more than just that, of course, but this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is where we need details.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Elements are simple computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     structures, we will suppose.  They may have a bit of machinery inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     them (i.e. they are not passive data structures, they are active
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     entities), and they have connections to other elements (a variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     different kinds of connections, including transient and long-term).  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the most part, all elements have the same kind of structure and code
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     inside them, but different data (so, to a first approximation, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     element is not an arbitrary piece of code, like an Actor, but more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     an elaborate form of connectionist &quot;unit&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay. Connectionism typically uses a few simple equations with large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vectors of floating point coefficients, plus an optimized hill climbing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm to tweak the coefficients for a training data set. What do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propose to use instead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The most important aspect of an element's life is its history.  When it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     first comes into being, its purpose is to capture a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     regularity (the co-occurence of some other elements, perhaps), and from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     then on it refines itself so as to capture more precisely the pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     that it has made its own.  So, when I first encounter a dog, I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     build an element that represents &quot;frisky thing with tail that barks and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     tries to jump on me&quot;, and then as my experience progresses, this concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     (aka element) gets refined in all the obvious ways and becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     sophisticated enough for me to have a full blown taxonomy of all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     different types of dogs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How? Forget the me-vs-them business, this is what it comes down to: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _how_ exactly would your proposed architecture accomplish the above?
</em><br>
