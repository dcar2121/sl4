<em>&gt;  If legos could be used to build a machine that encodes information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performs logical operations on it, at a sufficient level of complexity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that lego contraption would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think before we can name it a post-contemporary conscious computer system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it needs more. Consciousness requires a focal point generally named a self.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By &quot;self&quot; I mean that focalizing agent exposed in the dual sound source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment. The subject had earphones on. On one side was played a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation, on the other was played another. What was revealed is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject could only attend to and remember one sound source at a time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was impossible to attend to both. So the root of consciousness was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focalizing agent, or self, that has no option but to switch its focalizing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to a single source. This self also refers to itself as &quot;I&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has personal memory of of this I's unique experiences. This self is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focalizing agent of consciousness and so must be included in any artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness. Consciousness is also intertwined with and propagated by raw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense data (sensor signals), as well as emotional and motivational content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that create the same interactive effect. So artificial consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires all this, and is it not true that to create artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciosness in a robot is to create artificial life itself?
</em><br>
<p>Yep, I left that part out.  If you read the paper that I reference,
<br>
the requirements for consciousness are information *integration* (into
<br>
the so-called seamless global experience).  When I said &quot;at a
<br>
sufficient level of complexity&quot; I meant &quot;at a sufficient level of
<br>
integration.&quot;
<br>
<p>The theory holds up to empirical scrutiny, because the brain regions
<br>
that we know contribute to consciousness (the thalamo-coritcol system)
<br>
have precisely the integrative organization necessary (and predicted
<br>
by the theory).  Other brain regions that don't contribute directly to
<br>
consciousness, such as the cerebellum, have more functionally
<br>
independent organization.
<br>
<p>If you split a conscious system (like the brain) into two independent
<br>
non-interacting parts, you get two new systems with a lower level
<br>
consciousness than the original because there's less integration of
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>My point earlier was that this is substrate independent, and even
<br>
legos (which don't create emergent quantum effects, I presume) could
<br>
get the job done.
