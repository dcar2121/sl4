yep. It would be great if sobebody developed a memetic
system to bring them to our side. As far as I can tell,
transforming HS kids into fans of the singularity would require TREMENDOUS
memetic effort. But who knows....
The possibility exists.

I don't quite agree with this. The effects of the Singularity will affect
these people too -- shouldn't we put some effort into at least trying to
make them understand that it could be a good thing? Won't the Singularrity
have rather negative effects on a race that is more or less unprepared?
Although it is a cliche -- let's face it, those high school kids are the
future!
