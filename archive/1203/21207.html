<p>
Just this prints something not draws it. I don't know if it's as good
<br>
as that thing the other day where you divide 1 by something and it
<br>
prints every real number up to 100 or something buffered by zeroes.
<br>
But this is pretty good. I think I found it on shrooms. I forget how.
<br>
Bear with me. I try some things in this
<br>
<p>math one
<br>
<p>Check out what this is. If you try to print powers of two this particular
<br>
wrong way, in order to represent them using fewer digits, it prints powers
<br>
of two instead, in certain bases, including ours. It prints powers of two
<br>
you can't represent with that rule because it becomes ambiguous with more
<br>
than two digits per number. You need a high and a low one. But I've tried to
<br>
extend it here too. Which took some time. Darn. Please continue. Brix'll be
<br>
shat.
<br>
<p>if you mistakenly (ha, ha) represent the powers of two that have two digits
<br>
by subtracting the low one from the high one until the rule breaks at 128
<br>
which has three digits, ah, you see,
<br>
<p>OK I just realized you can extend the rule and ...
<br>
<p>look. If you say 16 by going 6-1 = 5, 32 by saying 3-2 = 1, and 64 by saying
<br>
6-4 = 2, for some crazy reason, and place them after the powers of 2 before
<br>
them, that way, you get:
<br>
<p>1 2 4 8 5 1 2
<br>
<p>See how it spells 512. One of the first powers of 2 you won't be able to
<br>
represent that way since the rule should break down at two digits but I'll
<br>
come back to that. Even representing them that way for the powers of two
<br>
that are only two digits long you get 1 and 2 again which aren't unique
<br>
though 5 is. And I just figured out, you can extend the rule to the
<br>
three-digit powers of two, by figuring out which two digits add up to a
<br>
number large enough to subtract the remaining digit from, if there isn't
<br>
already one digit long enough... the way I did it, I got,
<br>
<p>128... 8 - (2 + 1) = 5
<br>
256... (2 + 5) - 6 = 1
<br>
512... 5 - (1 - 3) = 2
<br>
<p>So 512 serves to print itself suddenly. Holy shit! Let's see if you can use
<br>
that rule on those numbers another way.
<br>
<p>Trying 128 again:
<br>
<p>If we add 2 to 8 to get 10 and subtract 1 we get 9. Good, there's another
<br>
way. I just happened to find one that did spell 512 again. Well let's try to
<br>
do it this way, making the biggest number we can from two digits and
<br>
subtracting the smallest one, and see what it spells.
<br>
<p>128 : (8 + 2) - 1 = 9
<br>
256:  (5 + 6) - 2 = 9
<br>
512:  (5 + 2) - 1 = 6
<br>
<p>Wow then it says 996. See that system isn't any good. That's what it's
<br>
trying to tell me. Look what happens if you do it in octal, where 8, 16,
<br>
and 32 are said 10, 20, and 40. If you try that rule you go 1 - 0, 2 - 0 and
<br>
4 - 0 and just get 1, 2, 4 again. It says,
<br>
<p>124124
<br>
<p>Then you can use the same rule on the higher powers of two, in octal, and
<br>
only one way, because all the other digits will be zeroes. So you extend it
<br>
and just get
<br>
<p>124124124...
<br>
<p>From,
<br>
<p>1
<br>
2
<br>
4
<br>
10
<br>
20
<br>
40
<br>
100
<br>
200
<br>
400
<br>
...
<br>
<p>No good at all. So I figured this out walking around just now, about what it
<br>
does in octal and guess what, in binary, every power of two also has only
<br>
one high digit, the rest zero, so you can use the rule in that too, where
<br>
you get,
<br>
<p>111111111
<br>
<p>Now maybe that's not saying much
<br>
<p>So I got home and thought about other bases of course, what about really
<br>
weird numbers of fingers or whatever? In hexadecimal, a power-of-two base
<br>
like octal, you can say &quot;128&quot; as &quot;80&quot; but at 256 it's &quot;100&quot; which in this
<br>
weird system I made up goes &quot;8&quot;, &quot;1&quot;. It goes,
<br>
<p>124812481248
<br>
<p>Because unlike octal it has 8, 80, 800... ok. So,
<br>
<p>Seriously what is going on. I got this javascript open that does bases 1
<br>
through 20. So let's try the powers of 2 and spell them this way and see
<br>
what -that- spells, in each. Hell I'll even do the ones I just did, over
<br>
again. If you've forgotten what we're doing,
<br>
<p>We're representing powers of 2 by subtracting the lower digits from the
<br>
higher one, if we can. Because of the amazing effects on the human mind it
<br>
has. Like something is trying to tell us we're doing it wrong if we try to
<br>
represent them that way, the numbers. What would happen if you did this to
<br>
other numbers than powers of 2? Other series? Well hold. Let's try this first
<br>
<p>I would do this in python but I'm too lazy.
<br>
<p>Binary: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.....
<br>
<p>Trinary [way one]: 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2  0  0  2  2  1
<br>
Trinary [way two]: 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 4 8  8 10 10  8 10
<br>
<p>Sorry I did the rules on the digits of trinary powers of two but I showed
<br>
the decimal equivalents there. Interestingly way one is unchanged since it
<br>
didn't print any values over 2, weird. In trinary that's:
<br>
<p><p>Trinary [way one]: 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0  2   0   0   2   2   1
<br>
<p>Trinary [way two]: 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 4 22  22 101 101  22 101
<br>
<p><p>Notes
<br>
<p>Trinary: This was weird. I always got zeroes. For instance 32 goes 1012 in
<br>
trinary so you go 2 - (1+1+0) and get 0. Then 64 is 2101 so you do the
<br>
-same thing- and get 0 again, that's just up to 64 though. If you do 128,
<br>
11202, you could either go (2+2)-(1+1), 4-2 and get 2, or you can apparently
<br>
go (1+2)-(1+2) and get another 0. So what I did, I figured if you spell 32
<br>
as 2-2=0 and 64 as 3-1=2 although they have the same digits and it'd be
<br>
arbitrary do so, well golly you can get a &quot;2&quot; out of 11202 too, and if you
<br>
add the 1's in 100111, trinary for 256, and subtract the zeroes, you get a
<br>
4... but you could also subtract the ones from each other and get another 0
<br>
that's what I did in way one.
<br>
<p>So this is cool, 512 goes 20022 where even the first rule cannot make another
<br>
zero, it can only make a 2, unless you subtract the twos &quot;by each other&quot; which
<br>
look there's an odd number of them you can't, haha, maybe that is a joke about
<br>
that. -goes cross-eyes, throws up an alien-. So otherwise you add up the twos
<br>
and subtract the zeroes and get yes the next power of 2, grrr, and now I
<br>
really want to know if it's going to print 16 next or say something else so
<br>
let's continue. 1024=1101221. Both rules are ambiguous now I think, I mean,
<br>
one was just to get zeroes and one was just to get powers of two, so probably
<br>
with this many digits there are new rules we can try on these to get other
<br>
kinds of numbers. But ah, I think rule 1 might go (2+2)-(1+1+1+1) and get
<br>
another 0. Weird that on 512 it couldn't. Rule 2 though adds em and
<br>
subtracts the zero by now and we get oh my god, another 8. Look it doesn't
<br>
even try to say sixteen. 2048? 2210212. Rule 1 can go 5-5 for another 0.
<br>
OK... rule 2 goes 5+5, gets 10. Well. These rules are to avoid saying any
<br>
2-digit numbers. But what will that -do-?
<br>
<p>God I'm still on base 3. 4096 = 12121201 in base 3. By rule 1 we can say
<br>
(1+2+1+2)-(1+2+1) and get another 2. By some other damn old rule we could
<br>
say ie (2+2+2)-(1+1+1+1) and still get 2, ok. Or (2+2+2+1)-(1+1+1) and get
<br>
4. Or (2+2+2+1+1+1)-1 and get 8, another power of two. OOPS
<br>
<p>But you cannot say 0. So rule 1 gets another 2 instead, three zeroes after
<br>
the last one. So who cares? I'm really interested in what rule 2 will say
<br>
after that &quot;10&quot;. 1+2+1+2+1+2+1-0 = 10. No it says 10 again. Ok.
<br>
<p>8192 = 102020102 . Rule 1 can't make a zero the lowest number it can make is
<br>
another 2. Rule 2 adds em all up and we get ... an 8.  16384 = 211110211.
<br>
Rule 1 goes &quot;5-4&quot; and gets a 1. Rule 2 goes 2+1+1+1+1+2+1+1, another 10. 101
<br>
in trinary. Just realized I'm looking at these in decimal, &quot;wrongly&quot;. I'll
<br>
make a copy of the trinary chart showing it in that too. OK
<br>
<p>I've decided it doesn't spell anything in trinary. I'll try it in base 5
<br>
then give up for now
<br>
<p>Base 5: 1 2 4 [4/2] [4/2] [4/2/0] [8/4/0] [4/2] [4/2/0] [8/4/0] [8/6/4/2/0]
<br>
<p>Wow that was pretty cool. Look how the sums of the digits all different
<br>
ways, adding and subtracting them from each other, are always powers of 2
<br>
somehow. I mingled the digits every way I could think of up to 1024. 0 is
<br>
the only non power of two you see til you get that 6 which you get by adding
<br>
1 to 4 and 4 to get 9 and removing 3, weirdly. Oh shit I better represent it
<br>
in base 5 too. Though I don't think it does say anything, even in that. In
<br>
decimal though it says &quot;512&quot; (!) so it should say something in base 5 too.
<br>
Here it is again...
<br>
<p>Base 5: 1 2 4 [4/2] [4/2] [4/2/0] [13/4/0] [4/2] [4/2/0] [13/4/0] [13/6/4/2/0]
<br>
<p>Dunno. OK. So for base 5 we could just take the low ones and say
<br>
12422002000. That doesn't spell anything. The next one the lowest number you
<br>
can get is 2 not 0 so now we can see 20020002. Maybe it continues 00002
<br>
0000002. Then it's kind of funny that it starts with 22. Ah. WE DON'T KNOW.
<br>
<p>Spelling it with the high ones it's
<br>
<p>1 2 4 4 4 4 8 4 4 8 8
<br>
<p>Eh
<br>
<p>I've probably bored you all. The juicy bit is at the top, what this does in
<br>
decimal (especially), binary, octal and hex. Well. OK. I will try base 20,
<br>
though.
<br>
<p>So 32 (in base 20) is C1, C - 1 is B. Uh
<br>
<p>64 is 34 and becomes 4 - 3 = 1. B1
<br>
<p>128 = 68, 8 - 6 = 2. B12
<br>
<p>256 = CG... G - C = 4. B124
<br>
<p>512 = 15C ... C - (5+1) = 6. B1246. Or if we say C+5, 17, -1, we get 16,
<br>
wow. Of course we could add them together to get 18 but why. At least it has
<br>
one and eight not a lousy six.
<br>
<p>1024 = 2B4... B - (2+4) = 5. B12465. -or- (B+4) - 2 = 13; or (B+2) - 4 = 9,
<br>
who cares
<br>
<p>2048 = 528... 5+8 - 2 = 11... uh-oh another weird 11. Can't (2+5)-8.
<br>
(8+2)-5=3. So you can say eleven or three. Or five or nine.
<br>
<p>4096, A4G, ... well... In decimal they seem to go,
<br>
<p>Base 20: 1 2 4 8 16 12 1 2 4 [18/16/6] [15/11/3] [15/13/5/9] [31/23/3]
<br>
<p>Notice I spelled the &quot;B&quot; 12 up there and the next thing it prints is a &quot;12&quot;,
<br>
1 and 2. Pretty cute. But I'm not totally sure. Well
<br>
<p>Listen. I better go
<br>
<p>flamoot
