512... 5 - (1 - 3) = 2
<br>
<p>This got screwed up. Should say 5 - (2 + 1) = 2.
<br>
<p>It -does- spell 512. I'm rootkitted and the CIA can edit stuff while
<br>
I'm working on it and stuff. Well come on. If you do this and try to
<br>
say 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, with it, something says to you,
<br>
<p>1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 1, 2
<br>
<p>-Why- would it go and spell a power of two. That's what I found on
<br>
shrooms. That's why I did all that. Sorry if parts are wrong. I'm
<br>
proofing it now

<em>&gt; as that thing the other day where you divide 1 by something and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prints every real number up to 100 or something buffered by zeroes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this is pretty good. I think I found it on shrooms. I forget how.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bear with me. I try some things in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Check out what this is. If you try to print powers of two this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong way, in order to represent them using fewer digits, it prints powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of two instead, in certain bases, including ours. It prints powers of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't represent with that rule because it becomes ambiguous with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than two digits per number. You need a high and a low one. But I've tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend it here too. Which took some time. Darn. Please continue. Brix'll be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you mistakenly (ha, ha) represent the powers of two that have two digits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by subtracting the low one from the high one until the rule breaks at 128
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which has three digits, ah, you see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK I just realized you can extend the rule and ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look. If you say 16 by going 6-1 = 5, 32 by saying 3-2 = 1, and 64 by saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6-4 = 2, for some crazy reason, and place them after the powers of 2 before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, that way, you get:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 2 4 8 5 1 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See how it spells 512. One of the first powers of 2 you won't be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent that way since the rule should break down at two digits but I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come back to that. Even representing them that way for the powers of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are only two digits long you get 1 and 2 again which aren't unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though 5 is. And I just figured out, you can extend the rule to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three-digit powers of two, by figuring out which two digits add up to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number large enough to subtract the remaining digit from, if there isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already one digit long enough... the way I did it, I got,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 128... 8 - (2 + 1) = 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 256... (2 + 5) - 6 = 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 512... 5 - (1 - 3) = 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So 512 serves to print itself suddenly. Holy shit! Let's see if you can use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that rule on those numbers another way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trying 128 again:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we add 2 to 8 to get 10 and subtract 1 we get 9. Good, there's another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way. I just happened to find one that did spell 512 again. Well let's try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do it this way, making the biggest number we can from two digits and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtracting the smallest one, and see what it spells.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 128 : (8 + 2) - 1 = 9
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 256:  (5 + 6) - 2 = 9
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 512:  (5 + 2) - 1 = 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow then it says 996. See that system isn't any good. That's what it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to tell me. Look what happens if you do it in octal, where 8, 16,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 32 are said 10, 20, and 40. If you try that rule you go 1 - 0, 2 - 0 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4 - 0 and just get 1, 2, 4 again. It says,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 124124
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then you can use the same rule on the higher powers of two, in octal, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one way, because all the other digits will be zeroes. So you extend it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and just get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 124124124...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 40
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 200
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 400
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No good at all. So I figured this out walking around just now, about what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does in octal and guess what, in binary, every power of two also has only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one high digit, the rest zero, so you can use the rule in that too, where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 111111111
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now maybe that's not saying much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I got home and thought about other bases of course, what about really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weird numbers of fingers or whatever? In hexadecimal, a power-of-two base
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like octal, you can say &quot;128&quot; as &quot;80&quot; but at 256 it's &quot;100&quot; which in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weird system I made up goes &quot;8&quot;, &quot;1&quot;. It goes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 124812481248
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because unlike octal it has 8, 80, 800... ok. So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously what is going on. I got this javascript open that does bases 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through 20. So let's try the powers of 2 and spell them this way and see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what -that- spells, in each. Hell I'll even do the ones I just did, over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again. If you've forgotten what we're doing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're representing powers of 2 by subtracting the lower digits from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher one, if we can. Because of the amazing effects on the human mind it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has. Like something is trying to tell us we're doing it wrong if we try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent them that way, the numbers. What would happen if you did this to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other numbers than powers of 2? Other series? Well hold. Let's try this first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would do this in python but I'm too lazy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Binary: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trinary [way one]: 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2  0  0  2  2  1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trinary [way two]: 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 4 8  8 10 10  8 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry I did the rules on the digits of trinary powers of two but I showed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the decimal equivalents there. Interestingly way one is unchanged since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't print any values over 2, weird. In trinary that's:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trinary [way one]: 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0  2   0   0   2   2   1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trinary [way two]: 1 2 0 0 0 1 2 4 22  22 101 101  22 101
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trinary: This was weird. I always got zeroes. For instance 32 goes 1012 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trinary so you go 2 - (1+1+0) and get 0. Then 64 is 2101 so you do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -same thing- and get 0 again, that's just up to 64 though. If you do 128,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 11202, you could either go (2+2)-(1+1), 4-2 and get 2, or you can apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go (1+2)-(1+2) and get another 0. So what I did, I figured if you spell 32
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as 2-2=0 and 64 as 3-1=2 although they have the same digits and it'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary do so, well golly you can get a &quot;2&quot; out of 11202 too, and if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add the 1's in 100111, trinary for 256, and subtract the zeroes, you get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4... but you could also subtract the ones from each other and get another 0
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's what I did in way one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So this is cool, 512 goes 20022 where even the first rule cannot make another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero, it can only make a 2, unless you subtract the twos &quot;by each other&quot; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look there's an odd number of them you can't, haha, maybe that is a joke about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that. -goes cross-eyes, throws up an alien-. So otherwise you add up the twos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and subtract the zeroes and get yes the next power of 2, grrr, and now I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really want to know if it's going to print 16 next or say something else so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let's continue. 1024=1101221. Both rules are ambiguous now I think, I mean,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one was just to get zeroes and one was just to get powers of two, so probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this many digits there are new rules we can try on these to get other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of numbers. But ah, I think rule 1 might go (2+2)-(1+1+1+1) and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another 0. Weird that on 512 it couldn't. Rule 2 though adds em and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtracts the zero by now and we get oh my god, another 8. Look it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even try to say sixteen. 2048? 2210212. Rule 1 can go 5-5 for another 0.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK... rule 2 goes 5+5, gets 10. Well. These rules are to avoid saying any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2-digit numbers. But what will that -do-?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God I'm still on base 3. 4096 = 12121201 in base 3. By rule 1 we can say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1+2+1+2)-(1+2+1) and get another 2. By some other damn old rule we could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say ie (2+2+2)-(1+1+1+1) and still get 2, ok. Or (2+2+2+1)-(1+1+1) and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. Or (2+2+2+1+1+1)-1 and get 8, another power of two. OOPS
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you cannot say 0. So rule 1 gets another 2 instead, three zeroes after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last one. So who cares? I'm really interested in what rule 2 will say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after that &quot;10&quot;. 1+2+1+2+1+2+1-0 = 10. No it says 10 again. Ok.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8192 = 102020102 . Rule 1 can't make a zero the lowest number it can make is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another 2. Rule 2 adds em all up and we get ... an 8.  16384 = 211110211.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rule 1 goes &quot;5-4&quot; and gets a 1. Rule 2 goes 2+1+1+1+1+2+1+1, another 10. 101
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in trinary. Just realized I'm looking at these in decimal, &quot;wrongly&quot;. I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a copy of the trinary chart showing it in that too. OK
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've decided it doesn't spell anything in trinary. I'll try it in base 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then give up for now
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Base 5: 1 2 4 [4/2] [4/2] [4/2/0] [8/4/0] [4/2] [4/2/0] [8/4/0] [8/6/4/2/0]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow that was pretty cool. Look how the sums of the digits all different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, adding and subtracting them from each other, are always powers of 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow. I mingled the digits every way I could think of up to 1024. 0 is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the only non power of two you see til you get that 6 which you get by adding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 to 4 and 4 to get 9 and removing 3, weirdly. Oh shit I better represent it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in base 5 too. Though I don't think it does say anything, even in that. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decimal though it says &quot;512&quot; (!) so it should say something in base 5 too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here it is again...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Base 5: 1 2 4 [4/2] [4/2] [4/2/0] [13/4/0] [4/2] [4/2/0] [13/4/0] [13/6/4/2/0]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dunno. OK. So for base 5 we could just take the low ones and say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12422002000. That doesn't spell anything. The next one the lowest number you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can get is 2 not 0 so now we can see 20020002. Maybe it continues 00002
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0000002. Then it's kind of funny that it starts with 22. Ah. WE DON'T KNOW.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spelling it with the high ones it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 2 4 4 4 4 8 4 4 8 8
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've probably bored you all. The juicy bit is at the top, what this does in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decimal (especially), binary, octal and hex. Well. OK. I will try base 20,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So 32 (in base 20) is C1, C - 1 is B. Uh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 64 is 34 and becomes 4 - 3 = 1. B1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 128 = 68, 8 - 6 = 2. B12
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 256 = CG... G - C = 4. B124
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 512 = 15C ... C - (5+1) = 6. B1246. Or if we say C+5, 17, -1, we get 16,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wow. Of course we could add them together to get 18 but why. At least it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one and eight not a lousy six.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1024 = 2B4... B - (2+4) = 5. B12465. -or- (B+4) - 2 = 13; or (B+2) - 4 = 9,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who cares
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2048 = 528... 5+8 - 2 = 11... uh-oh another weird 11. Can't (2+5)-8.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (8+2)-5=3. So you can say eleven or three. Or five or nine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4096, A4G, ... well... In decimal they seem to go,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Base 20: 1 2 4 8 16 12 1 2 4 [18/16/6] [15/11/3] [15/13/5/9] [31/23/3]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Notice I spelled the &quot;B&quot; 12 up there and the next thing it prints is a &quot;12&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 and 2. Pretty cute. But I'm not totally sure. Well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Listen. I better go
</em><br>
