I do. It has a lot of means to upgrade us (if there is any Singularity around, that is. I say it isn't.)

We need some matter, of course. We don't need the part of the Sun shining away, the Earth interior ... and so on. But we could need that as a computorium to enlarge our world substantially. Any Singularity worth anything - would give us that - immediately. And not just seating idle. Don't you think so?
