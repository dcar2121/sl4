(Is there a convention in this mailing list about posting replies on top, 
<br>
or on bottom?)
<br>
<p>I'm not a hardware guy, so I'm sure I'll be corrected when I get something 
<br>
wrong.  :)
<br>
You're assuming that I want to read the e out in digital form (hence the 
<br>
need for the very accurate volt-meter).  I wouldn't need to ever convert it 
<br>
to digital for though to get 2e for example though.  Let's say you wanted 
<br>
to get a certain voltage at a certain place in your system.  In digital, 
<br>
you'd have to turn it all into an estimate (read a voltage), do your math, 
<br>
then convert back into a voltage.  But if we were doing it with analog (for 
<br>
a neural network let's say), then we would start with a voltage, run it 
<br>
through a system, and have another voltage come out the other side.  As far 
<br>
as the noise goes, from what I understand, the &quot;noise&quot; (the fuzziness) in 
<br>
the qbits in the quantum computers is what we are measuring/operating on.
<br>
So, in a sense that is another thing that analog can do that digital can't: 
<br>
use noise as part of the computation.
<br>
(Ok, noise can be simulated in a digital system, but that takes even more 
<br>
processing power.)
<br>
<p>Once again, I'm not saying that the whole AI needs to be analog, just that 
<br>
it should use at least some analog (where appropriate).  We could get into 
<br>
a whole discussion on free will possibly arising out of the noise, but then 
<br>
we need to ask if the AI will need free will, and what free will is, and a 
<br>
thousand other questions.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; 1) What can analog do that digital can't.

<em>&gt; &gt; Analog can store infinitely complex values in a single unit.  The value e
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could be stored in full precision (from what I've read) in a quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer.  Digital systems are always limited by their resources (# of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flops, how many bits of storage does it have, etc...).  Sure, a digital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer can get very close to e, but it can never touch the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;i think you are missing the major reason why digital is being used as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opposed to analogue. you are right, with a digital system our storage (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computation) is limited by the number of bits we have to store. so arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precision requires arbitrary number of &quot;components&quot; (bits of ram for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example). also true, that a single analogue component (say a capacitor, i
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know it's not a good analogue component, but it can store a signal in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electric field) can store an arbitrary precision number(it would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scaled by some value, so we would need two per number). the problem is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;twofold. first when you read you 'e' back from the storage, you must have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very accurate voltmeter. so the precision of the computer now depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;completely on your ability to accurately measure voltage to a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number of significant digits. so if you cared about 100 digits of e, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would need a voltmeter with 100 digit precision. which is a lot harder to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find than 100 flip-flops to represent e in a digital computer. the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;major factor is (always) noise. in a digital computer, an analogue signal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can take on only two values, so it can be distinguished from noise very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easily. if you use analogue components, somewhere along the line, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precision of the signal you are storing/computing will be drowned out by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;noise of the system. so again, you cannot store a number more precise than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the noise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;both of these problems have a very easy solution. use more &quot;components&quot;. if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you need to store 100 digits of e, but your voltmeter is only good at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reading 4, store the number in 25 &quot;components&quot;. and if your signal to noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ratio is to high for you to read those digits, use 50, or 100. as you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see, its very easy to transform an analogue system into a digital one. in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact, because you are so limited by noise and instrument precision, you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have to do it anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;so in reality, digital and analogue are equivalent, one requires more bits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the other, more precise instruments. bits are cheaper, easier to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufacture, and scale.
