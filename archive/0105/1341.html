<p>
(sorry about forgetting the subject line; I've resent the whole thing 
<br>
so that the thread will be maintained in the archive)
<br>
<p>Okay, I've been away for a month, busy with all sorts of work, but 
<br>
now I'm back.  I still haven't finished reading all of the backed up 
<br>
messages (I still have about 100 to go), but I'm getting closer and 
<br>
coming up to speed.  I wish I could have participated in some of 
<br>
those discussions, but at this point I don't think that there is much 
<br>
I could add by bringing up old business.
<br>
<p>Anyway, on with this post.  I have some objections to section 4.2.2 
<br>
of FAI (the section on selfishness).  First off, I want to start out 
<br>
by writing that I, by and large, agree with all of section 4.2 and 
<br>
the sentiments behind 4.2.2, but the execution of 4.2.2 is poor and 
<br>
needs to be improved (or, maybe I've mixed in my sentiments and 
<br>
really disagree with this section of the paper).
<br>
<p>(In these next few paragraphs, I use 'you' to mean Eliezer at times, 
<br>
and at other times everyone.  Use the context to figure out just to 
<br>
whom I'm writing.)
<br>
<p>Firstly, friendship does not require reciprocy.  Yet, the idea of 
<br>
mutual friendship seems to be pretty strong in section 4.2.2.3.  Now, 
<br>
maybe I have a more conservative view of friendship, but, to me, I 
<br>
have standards for someone being my friend, and I consider myself to 
<br>
only have 3/2 friends (that's one whole friend and one person who 
<br>
meets enough of my standards for me to be half friends with, but not 
<br>
the level of concern that friendship, for me, entails).  Now, for 
<br>
social reasons, there are plenty of people with whom I'm *friendly*, 
<br>
but not friends.  By friendly I mean behavior that is expected of 
<br>
friends, but not necessairly directed at a friend.  For example, I 
<br>
might act interested in a person's story about vis latest personal 
<br>
achievement that doesn't really concern me, but I do it because I 
<br>
believe there to be some advantage in doing so.  I think that this 
<br>
section goes along with my line of reasoning, but just expresses it 
<br>
in the wrong way.  Maybe a better definition of what is meant by 
<br>
friend, or maybe a change in wording to something like friendly 
<br>
actions.
<br>
<p>Maybe the real point is that there is no such thing as a friend for 
<br>
evolutionary purposes; friends are only created out of cognition. 
<br>
Other are merely associations that there is a benefit to act friendly 
<br>
towards, and maintain a faux friendship even when it is not always 
<br>
immediately a good idea to be friendly.
<br>
<p>Secondly, you change what you mean by selfish.  In the first four 
<br>
sections of 4.2.2, selfishness seems to mean having a sense of self 
<br>
and, as a result, making decisions where benefit the self the most. 
<br>
Then, in 4.2.2.4, selfishness suddenly turns to become greediness. 
<br>
You try to seperate the ideas by suggesting human and bacterial 
<br>
selfishness, but that isn't very good, because you've overloaded the 
<br>
term.  Bacteria are greedy, in that they have no sense of self, so do 
<br>
whatever has the greatest immediate benefit.  Humans have a sense of 
<br>
self, and thus think 'hmm, how will this affect *me*?'.  There is not 
<br>
some kind of unchecked selfishness going on, though, because the 
<br>
concepts are different.  A person cannot be selfish and greedy at the 
<br>
same time:  they are mutually exclusive.  Well, I should correct 
<br>
that:  an intelligence can have a sense of self but also be 
<br>
irrational and thus be greedy because of an inability to realize the 
<br>
effects of having a self, therefore effectively not selfish.
<br>
<p>Anyway, a lot of this is just a matter of diction, but I think that 
<br>
they are very important, especially in a paper like FAI.  Hackers are 
<br>
going to be the ones doing the work of implimentation, and they will 
<br>
take the paper literally if it is given to them as an outline for 
<br>
implimenting FAI.  You can't just hope that everyone will figure out 
<br>
what you are writing about.
<br>
<p>Also, I should admit I'm a bit like Humpty Dumpty, only I make words 
<br>
mean something other than accepted definitions when those definitions 
<br>
are useless (when there are several words which make distinctions 
<br>
that are virtual).
