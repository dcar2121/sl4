<em>&gt; I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Java supercompiler description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 		+ computer science background (e.g. useful CS
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theorems encoded in Mizar)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 			+ WM reasoning system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a framework that will allow WM to gradually learn to rewrite code to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more intelligent, starting with simple code and eventually working up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worry that this is an understatement. Self-improvement, for an AI, involves
<br>
programming. No doubt about that. Programming and lots and lots of it. But I
<br>
worry that between '+ computer science background' and '+ WM reasoning system'
<br>
there's a lot of knowledge and work being hidden or left out.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start with '+ computer science background (e.g. useful CS theorems encoded in
<br>
Mizar)'. This is such a gigantic task that it's hard to even know where to
<br>
begin such a thing. Mizar is extremely difficult to read and write, at least
<br>
for people. A couple of people I know, who I consider math geniuses (and who
<br>
have the CV to back it up) get headaches looking at Mizar. It's complex and
<br>
tedious, and math theorems that we can express in a few pages with standard
<br>
notation and comments become, in Mizar, thousands and thousands of lines long.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using this language to formally express CS theorems will be even more
<br>
difficult - skewing its original purpose. It would be more appropriate to
<br>
build a new Mizarish language, also sufficiently capable of formal expression
<br>
and more directly related to the CS domain.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even solving this difficulty, you must find people who can select CS theorems
<br>
and translate them into Mizarish and verify them. Are there many people
<br>
capable and willing to do such a thing? I honestly do not know the answer to
<br>
this one.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of which 'CS theorems' to translate is an important task. Even with
<br>
software assistance it is going to take serious time to translate a small
<br>
portion of the body of formalizable CS theorems. The order could be very, very
<br>
important.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on, the next area of difficulty is semantics. Theorems in Mizarish may
<br>
be nice, but if you don't know how to use them to accomplish tasks, they're
<br>
useless. Attaching use case information to each theorem, and generating
<br>
metatheorems that connect the dots, will take even more time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there's the vast majority of CS knowledge, having to do not with
<br>
abstract CS problems but with how we actually build software. A complete
<br>
self-improving system must be able to analyze a software system in whole and
<br>
in parts, often without any kind of useful documentation. This is not covered
<br>
by existing theorems, and I have doubts that appropriate theorems could be
<br>
designed by humans.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surmounting all these obstacles, you have a system which ought to be able to
<br>
A) write software which can solve some given problems, and B) optimize or
<br>
improve existing software. However, there's still a gigantic gap between B and
<br>
improving an AI system, and that is Domain Specific Knowledge. Optimizing the
<br>
pieces of an AI system will make it run faster, but not better. To make it run
<br>
better, the system must rewrite itself perhaps from the very ground up, and in
<br>
order to do that it must understand how its code relates to artificial
<br>
intelligence in very specific ways. That is, it must understand intelligence.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's repeat that for those who may not have heard: the AI must understand AI
<br>
in order to improve itself. It must understand the theory of artificial
<br>
intelligence that was used to create it and its implementation specifics very
<br>
well. Then it must go about improving both the design and implementation of
<br>
its intelligence, a very complex task, as Ben Goertzel is aware.

<em>&gt; &gt; The Friendliness-topped goal system, the causal goal system, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probabilistic supergoals, and the controlled ascent feature are the main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things I'd want Webmind to add before the 1.0 version of the AI Engine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Causal goal system is basically there, we never finished our detailed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation on that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probabilistic supergoals are definitely there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Controlled ascent is absent so far; I have no objection to it, but it's just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not time to worry about it yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness-topped goal system is a delusion ;&gt;
