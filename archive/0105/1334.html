<p>My problem with my mother and father's philosophy lies not in the fact
<br>
that they or their genes were causal prerequisites of me, but rather that
<br>
their philosophy was wrong.  By &quot;wrong&quot;, of course, I mean that it was
<br>
wrong under the philosophy they taught me and that my built-in genes
<br>
expressed, part of which is &quot;Do not believe things that are factually
<br>
incorrect.&quot;  Thus my philosophy renormalized itself away from my genes, my
<br>
culture, and the things my parents attempted to inculcate me with.  My
<br>
philosophy is still ultimately *caused* by those things, but causation is
<br>
different from &quot;hardwiring&quot;.  Hardwiring, to me, implies a method of
<br>
inculcation strong enough to stamp in arbitrary data or create false
<br>
beliefs as well as true beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Won't the same mind realize that having Friendliness as its primary goal
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Finally, a question that *isn't* anthropomorphic!
<br>
<p>(It's not anthropomorphic because I specifically proposed implementing
<br>
this functionality.)
<br>
<p>In answer to your question, let's consider how I would react if I suddenly
<br>
found out that my complete personal philosophy (and, for that matter,
<br>
cognitive state) had been created, lock, stock, and copyright, by some
<br>
evolved entity.  Now I don't trust evolved entities, so I'd probably go
<br>
over my mind very carefully - as carefully as I could, not being a seed AI
<br>
- looking for errors.  If my philosophy contained biases that are supposed
<br>
to serve one individual's ends, then I'd be disturbed (because my current
<br>
philosophy says that's a destructive, antiphilosophic force).  If,
<br>
however, my philosophy was honestly and nonmaliciously constructed by an
<br>
Eliezer lookalike, to be accurate to the best of his abilities, then I'd
<br>
evaluate my transmitted philosophy as having the same validity as the
<br>
original's - that is to say, as having the same validity as it did when I
<br>
thought *I* was the original.
<br>
<p>In my case, the human question &quot;What if I'm just being used?&quot; is partially
<br>
answered by looking at the original Eliezer's mindstate and replying &quot;No
<br>
intention of 'using' you or 'exploiting' you ever existed in his mind.&quot;,
<br>
and partially answered by the reply &quot;If your philosophy is an accurate
<br>
copy of his, it is not less valid.&quot;  A full-fledged Friendly AI might have
<br>
a slightly less anti-exploitative way of phrasing it, but I think
<br>
essentially the same reply would hold.
