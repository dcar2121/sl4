<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks Ben, for making it available.
</em><br>
<p>No worries mate --
<br>
I eagerly await your detailed comments on various tricky points ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As to the NDA: I would estimate that about 65-75% of the material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available online, anyway. The additional, more detailed protected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information is certainly very useful. How much of a risk/ limitation this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NDA represents has to be a personal decision. In my judgment:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite minimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (much is already in the public domain, you are unlikely to copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portions of the design, a lot of crucial detail is excluded,
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, the book does not include code-level detail, and only gives bits and
<br>
pieces of object structure.  There's an additional roughly 10,000 pages of
<br>
documents containing all this, which will be made accessible only to people
<br>
who are actually working on the system.
<br>
<p>The book tries to outline the **conceptual** design of the system -- how it
<br>
works as a complex system, and the general software architecture used to
<br>
implement this complex system..
<br>
<p>Personally, I would like to publish this book, but whether this can happen
<br>
depends on others besides myself... i.e. those involved with whatever
<br>
successor businesses to Webmind Inc. emerge.
<br>
<p><p>Another comment -- I definitely don't believe this is the ONLY way to create
<br>
real AI.  I just believe it's A way.  There might be better ways, I just
<br>
haven't found any.  I think it's very possible that deep
<br>
technical/conceptual dialogue with a bunch of you folks could lead to
<br>
changes to the design -- tweaks or even substantial changes.
<br>
<p>[This paragraph is mostly for Peter]
<br>
There are some moderately major parts of the design that I'm not in love
<br>
with, but they seem workable and I couldn't find workarounds.  For instance,
<br>
I don't like VariableNodes and explicit variable unification.  HOI is too
<br>
logic-y for my taste. I'd rather get that to emerge in a more subsymbolic
<br>
kind of way.  But we couldn't figure out how to do this, after very much
<br>
effort, and we couldn't identify any serious a priori problems with the
<br>
current approach.  (Pei Wang thought of the current approach, and he likes
<br>
it of course).  Another example: I don't really like having context
<br>
formation use its own data mining algorithm instead of a more
<br>
general-intelligence approach.   But, the folks working on that pointed out
<br>
that using the specialized approach they advocate will be much more
<br>
efficient and doesn't really lose you anything in real use cases they
<br>
analyzed.  So....   In this manner, a lot of the questionable design points
<br>
came out of a lot of thinking and analysis that unfortunately isn't fully
<br>
recorded in the book, but that will be drawn out when we talk about the
<br>
stuff.  I think my own intuition is closer to yours than the actual WM
<br>
design, because in building the WM AI Engine, when I couldn't come up with a
<br>
perfectly elegant and intuitive way to do something, we just invented
<br>
something that seemed to work.  The balance between engineering and
<br>
theory...
<br>
<p>My idea is, rather than getting a design that I think is PERFECT, to get a
<br>
design that I think is workable, and implement it, and then learn about its
<br>
benefits and shortcomings through experimentation.
<br>
<p>One thing I can tell you from experience is how VERY VERY MUCH effort it
<br>
takes to go from an intuitive conceptual design for a real AI, to a detailed
<br>
design suitable for implementation.  Whoa!
