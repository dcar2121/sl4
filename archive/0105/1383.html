Quick microintro:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been lurking here for a while, but, well, haven't said much (well,
<br>
anything) for the simple reason that I didn't see much I could contribute at
<br>
the time. (I'm a physics person (well, on that learning path, at least), not
<br>
anywhere near a CS person.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A similar system might be used for interstellar communication at FTL
</em><br>
speeds
<br>
<em>&gt; something that computers/people of the future could certainly take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of.  Heck, I'd be pretty happy with FTL bus speeds just within
</em><br>
my PC.
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better yet, if this is &quot;complexity scaleable&quot;, that is, if this
<br>
principle can be used for more complex spacetime manipulation, perhaps this
<br>
could lead to the whole multidimensional processor thing? (&quot;Is that a Cray
<br>
in your pocket or are you just...&quot; :)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A question for Eliezer: From what I understand, as a general rule you
<br>
are against tech suppression, yet you sxaid that you'd have prefered that
<br>
this guy have not published this idea, instead done a nsa black project or
<br>
something. I was wondering why time travel, as opposed to other potentially
<br>
dangerous technologies, would be an exception to your rule.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of speculation in relation to this:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I don't have anywhere near the backround to understand how
<br>
exactly what he proposes would twist spacetime, however, it occurs to me
<br>
that it _may_ be even easier than he suggested. Since, except for the method
<br>
of slowing the light down, it isn't based on QM but relativity, I likely
<br>
don't need to keep in mind the photon aspect of light here. (if I'm saying
<br>
anything stupid here, someone, _please_, tell me) Also, perhaps the
<br>
wavelength is not too relavent.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I'm getting at is that if you used radiowaves or lower, then
<br>
instead of going through all this effort to slow light down, all you'd need
<br>
would be a set of coils and dipole antenas (or large parallel plate
<br>
caps/etc), arranged in a circle. drive them all with an appropriate phase
<br>
shift, and you can get what will look like an em wave circlating around this
<br>
setup at just about any speed you wish, with no need to muck around with
<br>
bose-einstin condensates.
<br>
<p>And finally, my META question...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to change the e-addy of mine that the list sends to?
<br>
