<p>
(Let me clarify one thing.  I was hinting that we would need quantum 
<br>
computers for self-awareness, but I'm not ruling out conventional analog 
<br>
systems either.  It's just that quantum is so much faster and smaller, and 
<br>
uses so much less energy, that if we do need more than digital, it's 
<br>
probably the way to go.)
<br>
<p>Looks like there are several issues here.
<br>
<p>1) What can analog do that digital can't.
<br>
Analog can store infinitely complex values in a single unit.  The value e 
<br>
could be stored in full precision (from what I've read) in a quantum 
<br>
computer.  Digital systems are always limited by their resources (# of 
<br>
flops, how many bits of storage does it have, etc...).  Sure, a digital 
<br>
computer can get very close to e, but it can never touch the value (yes, it 
<br>
could store it represented as an infinite series or as an expression, or 
<br>
whatever, but the value itself can't be touched).  This is just one 
<br>
example, probably not the best, but if it gets the point across that there 
<br>
is a set of capabilities that analog possesses that digital doesn't, then 
<br>
it serves its purpose.  (Yes, I know that all chips are analog at heart, 
<br>
but they have been designed to toss out the analog fuzziness to make nice 
<br>
and shinny 0's and 1's as far as the logic goes.)
<br>
<p>2) If the answer to 1 is not &quot;nothing&quot; then: Do we need what analog can do 
<br>
to build a truly self-aware AI (not just one that models self-awareness).
<br>
This is the part that gut feeling comes in (it is not meant to be a 
<br>
rigorous logical proof, just something to show that I have good reasons to 
<br>
act on my feelings).
<br>
Probably the reason behind the leap in logic is: I am analog.  I am 
<br>
self-aware (you don't need to believe this).  I suspect that others out 
<br>
there are self-aware because they behave similarly to me, and they all 
<br>
claim to be self aware.  So, inductively I can be pretty sure (99.999?%) 
<br>
that other 'Analogs' are self aware.  Of course this in itself doesn't rule 
<br>
out digitals being self aware but the test in different for them.  I would 
<br>
NOT expect a digital system that is self-aware to behave similarly to 
<br>
me.  I do not accept the Turing test (I've seen too many people fooled by 
<br>
programs like Eliza).
<br>
In short: I know (personally) that analog works.  I also believe that 
<br>
analog can do things digital can't.  I guess my leap is that I suspect that 
<br>
those things that analog does are partly responsible for self-awareness.
<br>
<p>3) Would we know that it's self-aware?
<br>
I doubt it.  At least not until we've been uploaded, or come into intimate 
<br>
contact with it.  Then again, it may be plainly obvious, but as far as 
<br>
coming up with an external test for true self-awareness (not modeled 
<br>
self-awareness) I'm pretty skeptical.
<br>
Note: there are programs out there (some of them virii that can modify 
<br>
their own code; I don't see this as sufficient for self-awareness).
<br>
<p>3) (Practicality) Do we really need true self-awareness in the AI to end 
<br>
the human era?
<br>
If an analog system could store a statement about the world (a bit of 
<br>
knowledge) while using less resources than a digital system could in 
<br>
modeling it, then why not use analog system?  Analog is faster, and more 
<br>
'true' (accurate).  Wouldn't we want to take the shortest path to self-aware?
<br>
<p><p>Out of curiosity, how many of the people in this group (%) can read 
<br>
code?  In case I want to use it as an example.
<br>

<br>
<p>PS, if this is one of those reoccurring topics that mailing lists are 
<br>
always dealing with, then it's probably worth talking about.  At least from 
<br>
the memes perspective.
