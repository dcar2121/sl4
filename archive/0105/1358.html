Some clarifications on the analog/ai issue... this is how I see it.
<br>
<p>(1) Digital systems are not limited to the Von Neuman model. Most digital
<br>
systems, today, are based upon the step-by-step, limited precision, array
<br>
memory, overgrown-calculator model of computation proposed by John Von Neuman
<br>
in his First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. This approach to digital
<br>
digital computing is neither necessary nor, except when such finite
<br>
constraints are practically acceptable, desirable. Symbolic math programs, 
<br>
such as Maple or Mathematica, use digital logic to perform general logic and,
<br>
in fact, it can be shown that any formal system can be represented in discrete
<br>
form (strings of symbols, finite number of transformations, etc.). If you read
<br>
the First Draft, Von Neuman actually starts off drawing parallels between
<br>
computational units (I think he called them &quot;atoms&quot;, not sure) and *neurons*.
<br>
Things like the adoption of the binary representation of numbers were only
<br>
things which he did for the sake of design simplicty. Imhop, it is unfortunate
<br>
that generations of computer programmers have, for the most part, blindly
<br>
followed the provisions of one of the earliest models of computing. I think
<br>
that, as this discussion indicates, the time for a break from the Von Neuman
<br>
model is coming. I also think that AI will be the main technology to do this.
<br>
To address an objection which was raised earlier, the modeling of analog
<br>
systems (modeling noise or not), *does* require alot of processing *using
<br>
today's digital technology*. Change the computing model (i.e., to some kind
<br>
of cellular automaton), and full digital modelling of anolog systems suddenly
<br>
becomes possible -- in real time, even, if you like.
<br>
<p>(2) There is no fundamental distinction between the &quot;analog&quot; and the &quot;digital&quot;.
<br>
Analog and digital are fundamentally just two different formal mappings 
<br>
between physical representations of information and their semantics. In other
<br>
words, the difference is in what the reading on the voltmeter is interpereted
<br>
to mean. It may be broken up into two ranges for the representation of one bit,
<br>
divided into four distinct voltage ranges for the representation of two bits,
<br>
or treated as a continuous value (a real number). Digital technology gets all
<br>
its &quot;spark&quot; from the the design advantages which digital systems provide over
<br>
analog ones. Digital components are basically all the same, digital machines
<br>
can easily be reconfigured, and digitization eliminates mechanical noise.
<br>
The gear was the first digital device, and Charles Babbage realized its power, 
<br>
in a rather grand way, by designing the first mechanical (yes, geared) CPU.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the invention of the pendulum clock to the Internet, digital technology 
</em><br>
has fueled a revolution in engineering simply because of design considerations.
<br>
Really, the difference between the analog and the digital is the same as the
<br>
difference between the integers and the real numbers. (I can see it now: Pi
<br>
saying to 10 &quot;I'm better than you are...&quot; :)
<br>
<p>(3) The human brain fits neither the &quot;analog&quot; nor &quot;digital&quot; characterizations.
<br>
The human brain (indeed, the whole nervous system) works with interphasing
<br>
oscillators which humans have yet to understand. So far, we may have invented
<br>
the analog, and invented the digital, but we have yet to invent/understand the
<br>
&quot;Fourrier&quot; computing ocurring in the human brain -- and, sorry, understanding
<br>
is a prerequisite for deliberate design. Once we invent the kind of component
<br>
which the human brain uses, then we may go about designing AIs which employ
<br>
them, because we'll be able to translate AI implementations from analog and
<br>
digital design spaces into the design space of the new technology. But, until
<br>
we crack the human brain, we just have to implement technology (like AI) using
<br>
techniques which we have.
<br>
<p>(4) The use of a particular representation system is not a prerequisite for 
<br>
engineering an AI. I think, by now, it is clear that the digital and the analog
<br>
are fundamentally the same and practically different. Besides, once an AI
<br>
becomes sentient, it will probably re-engineer itself, figure out how the
<br>
brain works, or invent a representation with more benefits than either digital,
<br>
analog, or &quot;neuronal&quot;, anyway.
