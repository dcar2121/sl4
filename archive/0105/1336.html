<p>No, abandon hope right now.
<br>
<p>I've just read an advance proof of Brian W. Aldiss's new collection
<br>
SUPERTOYS LAST ALL SUMMER LONG, which also contains the two short sequels
<br>
he wrote, after exhaustive discussions with Kubrick and Spielberg, to the
<br>
short piece that was the seed to the movie A.I.. Indications are that the
<br>
script has deviated very greatly from these pieces, but the key notion (as
<br>
often in Brian's work) is not just the robotopinnochio trope--silly as that
<br>
as--but a bleak, relentless assertion that most humans, most of the time,
<br>
are exactly `robotic' in the dreariest sense. A standard example from
<br>
`Supertoys in Other Seasons':
<br>
<p>&lt; Henry seized the boy and held him tightly, arms wrapped around him.
<br>
`David, you were an early product of my first mech company, Synthank. You
<br>
have since been superseded. You only think you are happy or sad. You only
<br>
think you loved Teddy or Monica [Henry's dead wife].'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Did you love Monica, Daddy?'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed heavily. `I thought I did.' &gt;
<br>
<p>The closing lines of the final story are dreadfully inevitable:
<br>
<p>&lt; [David] sat up. His hand went to his head. His expression was one of
<br>
amazement. `Daddy! What a strange dream I had. I never had a dream before...'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Welcome back, David, my boy,' said Henry.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Embracing the child, he lifted David off the bench. David and Teddy stared
<br>
at each other in wonder. Then they fell into each other's arms.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was almost human. &gt;
<br>
