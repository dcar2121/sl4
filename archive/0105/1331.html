<em>&gt; I guess Eliezer's point may be that the AI ~does~ have a choice in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his plan -- the Friendliness supergoal is not an absolute irrevocable 
</em><br>
goal, 
<br>
<em>&gt; it's just a fact (&quot;Friendliness is the most important goal&quot;) that is 
</em><br>
given 
<br>
<em>&gt; an EXTREMELY high confidence so that the system has to gain a HUGE 
</em><br>
AMOUNT 
<br>
<em>&gt; of evidence to overturn it.
</em><br>
<p>Something that concerns me is what happens when the AI decides to develop
<br>
an AI without the Friendliness supergoal?  Several pathways seem to 
<br>
conceivably
<br>
lead to this scenario.  The AI decides to study an AI without the 
<br>
Friendliness
<br>
supergoal perhaps not because it doubts the value of the goal but rather 
<br>
is
<br>
simply curious how an AI without this goal would function.  Alternatively, 
<br>
the
<br>
AI might realize on its own that its preset goals and supergoals have not 
<br>
been
<br>
subject to rigorous scrutiny (by the AI that is) and that it is inherently
<br>
biased towards evaluating them itself.  Hence, it creates an AI with 
<br>
minimal
<br>
preset goals either so that the original AI itself can evaluate the 
<br>
importance
<br>
of a particular goal or have the new AI itself serve as the evaluator.
<br>
<p>The objectives of hardwiring or effectively hardwiring Friendliness into 
<br>
an AI 
<br>
can be easily avoided/thwarted.  This does not mean these objectives 
<br>
shouldn't
<br>
still be pursued but it does apparently reduce the Friendliness approach 
<br>
to 
<br>
a stop gap measure.
