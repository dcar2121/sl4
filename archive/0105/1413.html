</em><br>
<p>benevolent:  1 a : marked by or disposed to doing good &lt;a benevolent 
<br>
donor&gt; b : organized for the purpose of doing good &lt;a benevolent 
<br>
society&gt;  2 : marked by or suggestive of goodwill &lt;benevolent smiles&gt;
<br>
<p>altruism:  1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of 
<br>
others  2 : behavior by an animal that is not beneficial to or may be 
<br>
harmful to itself but that benefits others of its species
<br>
<p>Look at the first definition for altruism; this is exactly what is 
<br>
going on in a Friendly AI.  Ve does not necessairly know verself 
<br>
(i.e. can use 'I' legitametly) but is concerend with respecting 
<br>
others wishes, including verself because ve doesn't realize the 
<br>
difference between verself and others.  The second definition, 
<br>
though, just outright doesn't matter, since it's not Friendly to hurt 
<br>
verself, even though ve doesn't have a sense of self.  As I have 
<br>
expressed earlier, a selfish AI will be Friendly just as a selfless 
<br>
and altruistic AI will be.
<br>
<p>I would really recommend reading section two of FAI; that's really 
<br>
the part that 'sold' me on Friendliness.
<br>
<p>Benevolent, as shown above, does not mean the same thing; it refers 
<br>
to doing good.  This is poor, since what is good tends to be 
<br>
subjective.  I've come to believe in what I refer to as relativistic 
<br>
morality (morality is objective within a reference frame, be that 
<br>
frame humanity, general intelligence, or some dumb animal), but 
<br>
realize that many people develop their own morals to supplant the 
<br>
objective ones.  Stalin may have considered himself benevolent, 
<br>
killing millions out of his own idea of goodwill, but in the 
<br>
reference frame of humanity, what he did was evil.  Thus, a Friendly 
<br>
AI could be benevolent, but it would be a bad idea to make it be 
<br>
benevolent to be Friendly, since that would mean it could think it 
<br>
was being Friendly by meeting it's own twisted morals.  Friendliness 
<br>
is depent on respecting volition.
<br>
<p>Oh, and as to the wishes of others being in conflict, it comes down 
<br>
to whatever does not hurt others.  If you really want something but 
<br>
it will hurt someone else in the process, a Friendly AI will not 
<br>
accomidate you.  While ve will try to respect anothers volition, ve 
<br>
will not violate it!  If you want to kill someone, a Friendly AI 
<br>
isn't going to stop you, but ve won't help you, either (well, this is 
<br>
where Eliezer wants the Sysop to step in and I don't).
<br>
<p>So, altruism is used here as best as it can be, benevolence is just 
<br>
flat out the wrong word.  If you can think of a better word (a new 
<br>
one maybe), I'll be more than happy to use it.  :-)
