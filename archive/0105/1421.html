<em>&gt;If there is a large enough power differential between a

<p>Do you really think they would be that uncaring?  I would suggest that a
<br>
super intelligence creature would treat us like we treat the lesser
<br>
animals on the earth.  We don't purposely go out and kill things just
<br>
because their in the way (although we can be irresponsible if we don't
<br>
notice the consequences of our actions) -- we usually try to get lesser
<br>
animals out of our way in a &quot;humane&quot; way and only when we can not get
<br>
them out of our way do we resort to eradicating them.
<br>
<p>We let raccoons live in the suburbs as long as they don't build their
<br>
homes in someone's attic... although raccoons then to get run over a lot
<br>
since they are not totally adapted to all the aspects of the artificial
<br>
environment.

Subject: superintelligence and ethical egoism

<p>Jimmy Wales said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (It wouldn't be very intelligent if it were anything but...)
</em><br>
<p>A superintelligence whose supreme goal is X only needs to care
<br>
about itself insofar as its own continued existence will assist
<br>
the achievement of X. If its goal is to blow up the earth, then
<br>
once that is done it can attach zero value to further 
<br>
self-preservation and shut down entirely. 
<br>
<p>and:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think we should fear this, by the way. We should hope for it. 
</em><br>
<p>(this being egoism in a superintelligence)
<br>
<p>If there is a large enough power differential between a
<br>
superintelligence
<br>
and us, egoism will not imply any sort of mutualism. If it doesn't
<br>
care about us, if we have nothing to offer it, and if we're in its
