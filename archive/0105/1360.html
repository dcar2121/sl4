<p>I'd be interested in learning more about this.  Can you recommend some

I think I see what your getting at here.  You're saying that integer 
<br>
numbers can be used to represent reals, as long as you don't need infinite 
<br>
precision, and  aren't worried about things like rounding errors.  And, I 
<br>
can see how that is practical in today's world when we want to know 100% 
<br>
what the result of some operation is/will be...  But if the only difference 
<br>
between today's computers and tomorrow's is speed and storage space (I 
<br>
think this is what Gordon Worley was getting at) then why don't we just 
<br>
write the AI to bring about a Singularity now (or last week)?  If it's all 
<br>
deterministic anyway, then couldn't we just simulate The AI with pencil and 
<br>
paper?  What I'm getting at is there seems to be some ingredient missing... 
<br>
something that will make the computers of tomorrow be able to do more than 
<br>
just play a really really fast game of solitaire.  Maybe all we're missing 
<br>
is the speed and storage space (and human invention in the way of 
<br>
software), but we shouldn't rule out the possibility that more will be 
<br>
required.
<br>
<p>I'll stop here, though I believe there is more to be said on this topic, 
<br>
and more will be said in the coming years.
