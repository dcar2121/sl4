</em><br>
<p>You do.
<br>
<p>Okay, I understand that unconditional friendship exists from an 
<br>
evolutionary standpoint, but since I don't experience it so I don't 
<br>
really grok it (but I can accept it and understand the facts of it). 
<br>
Oops, that might give away that I'm an AI.  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;No, &quot;selfishness&quot; is being used in exactly the same sense in both places.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By distinguishing between &quot;selfishness&quot; and &quot;greed&quot; you're assuming the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;presence of a bunch of nearby social equals who will stomp you flat if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get greedy.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  A person can be greedy without anyone around.  For 
<br>
example, I'm living all by my self in the Hidden Valley.  In the 
<br>
Valley, there is only so much to eat.  If I'm selfish, I understand 
<br>
that I can only eat so much food at one time, no matter how hungry I 
<br>
might be, because if I eat it all and there is no more food, I'll 
<br>
starve to death.  If I'm greedy, I fail to realize that my eating a 
<br>
lot will affect me, so I eat a whole bunch, have my fill, but all the 
<br>
food is dead and won't grow back, so I'm dead after about a week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A transhuman AI has no social equals, and the straight-line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;projection says that a selfish transhuman AI with no other cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complexity would act like a bacterium.  A selfish human acting like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bacterium is being foolish, unless there are no other humans to object, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which case selfishness translates directly to greed.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I agree with this and I think that I even restated this in my 
<br>
own words.  But, the point is, if you start being greedy, you are no 
<br>
longer acting selfishly.  One must disregard the sense of self and 
<br>
that what one does affects oneself in order to be greedy.  Continuing 
<br>
to call this selfishness is not really fair, since there is no longer 
<br>
a concern for the self (in that the AI can look out at the world and 
<br>
recognize verself, seeing the effects that vis actions will have on 
<br>
verself).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Anyway, a lot of this is just a matter of diction, but I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  they are very important, especially in a paper like FAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree, but for the record, I'm a perfectionist anyway; you can scold me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for anything, no matter how trivial.
</em><br>
<p>I'll keep that in mind.  Actually, I guess it comes out that I'm a 
<br>
perfectionist too (but only as a side effect of having OCD), because 
<br>
otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to write this up.  ;^)
