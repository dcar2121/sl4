</em><br>
<p>(For those of you who are not also subscribed to the Extropians list, this
<br>
is funny because there was a discussion about self-delusion in Bayesian
<br>
reasoners at the time.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You don't *really* have Friendliness as your ultimate supergoal ... you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a false self-model in which Friendliness is your ultimate supergoal!
</em><br>
<p>Okay, pardon me, I should have specified declarative goals.  Almost all my
<br>
declarative goals are justified in terms of Friendliness maximization via
<br>
Singularity.  (The declarative goals that aren't so justified are exotic
<br>
goals justified by the possibility that something other than Friendliness
<br>
is ethically preferable or that the Singularity is not the best way to
<br>
Friendliness.)
<br>
<p>Now, since human cognition is messy, I should specify down even further
<br>
what I mean by this.  When I take a deliberate action or make a deliberate
<br>
choice, I sometimes do so based on a deliberate value assessment, and I
<br>
sometimes do so based on a reflexive value assessment.  The reflexes are
<br>
derived both from instinctive/intuitive/emotional values and from previous
<br>
(cached) experience in applying my deliberate values.  Where I apply
<br>
deliberate values, I do so using a store of deliberate statements or
<br>
beliefs about goals.  Where I consciously set out to justify a value or
<br>
goal belief, I do so by reference to my beliefs about moral maximization
<br>
via the Singularity.
<br>
<p>For obvious reasons, however, this system also tends to emergently (or, in
<br>
my case, not so emergently) bubble up the belief that reflexive
<br>
assessments which differ from the justified assessments are &quot;bad&quot;, and
<br>
that deliberate statements that are unjustified because unexamined are
<br>
also &quot;bad&quot;.  Major actions and life-choices in particular are made almost
<br>
entirely using the &quot;top-level&quot; &quot;goal&quot; of a Friendly Singularity.
<br>
<p>In plainer English, this is only the standard self-conflict of a human
<br>
being rewritten as cognitive science.  We all have at least one emotion or
<br>
instinct that we'd as soon be rid of and that we expend effort on
<br>
combating.  In my case, I've won, or at least won to a much higher degree
<br>
than I'm led to believe is usual.  My moral philosophy is now the dominant
<br>
factor in decision making to a degree that becomes even higher for larger
<br>
or more deliberate decisions, especially decisions about how to make
<br>
decisions or decisions about how to organize my mind.
<br>
<p>A seed AI has (a) less junk cognition and (b) can rewrite vis own source
<br>
code.  So I may consider myself hot stuff by modern-day Western cultural
<br>
standards but I expect a mature seed AI to be a heck of a lot better.
