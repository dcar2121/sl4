<p>
Patrick,
<br>
<p>You  make a lot of really good points here...
<br>
<p>Clearly, one is going to have to take what I call an &quot;experiential
<br>
interactive learning&quot; approach.  One is going to have to teach the baby mind
<br>
AI theory step by step, giving it simple problems to solve, correcting it
<br>
when it's wrong, and so forth, incrementally.  At each stage in its
<br>
education, appropriate knowledge in a Mizar-variant can be given to it,
<br>
along with practical use-cases of this knowledge, and it can be posed with
<br>
problems to solve using this knowledge.  Just as when one learns something
<br>
in school.  (Not that I ever learned much math or computer science in
<br>
school, I always got more from reading the texts directly, but you get the
<br>
point... reading texts, one is still getting a carefully structured
<br>
combination of new information and exercises that force one to integrate
<br>
that new information with one's previous store of information.)
<br>
<p>Creating a &quot;CS and AI curriculum&quot; for an AI will be a really interesting
<br>
job.  This curriculum will bear some resemblance to the curriculum we use to
<br>
teach these subjects to humans, but it certainly won't be identical.
<br>
<p>In short, I guess that encoding CS knowledge in Mizar-ish way is one part of
<br>
the curriculum we need to make, but not the only part.  So you're right, my
<br>
previous post oversimplified the matter a bit, in the way it phrased things.
<br>
<p>In order for education to proceed reasonably smoothly, the AI will have to
<br>
be able to carry out basic human-language chat (so we can tell it when it's
<br>
wrong, give it suggestions as to different approaches, etc.).  However it
<br>
doesn't need to be able to read and fully understand arbitrarily complicated
<br>
human-language texts.
<br>
<p>ben
<br>
<p><p><p><p><em>&gt; 	Moving on, the next area of difficulty is semantics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theorems in Mizarish may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be nice, but if you don't know how to use them to accomplish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasks, they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless. Attaching use case information to each theorem, and generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metatheorems that connect the dots, will take even more time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Then there's the vast majority of CS knowledge, having to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract CS problems but with how we actually build software. A complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improving system must be able to analyze a software system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in whole and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in parts, often without any kind of useful documentation. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not covered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by existing theorems, and I have doubts that appropriate theorems could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed by humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Surmounting all these obstacles, you have a system which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A) write software which can solve some given problems, and B) optimize or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve existing software. However, there's still a gigantic gap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between B and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improving an AI system, and that is Domain Specific Knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Optimizing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pieces of an AI system will make it run faster, but not better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To make it run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, the system must rewrite itself perhaps from the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground up, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to do that it must understand how its code relates to artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence in very specific ways. That is, it must understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	Let's repeat that for those who may not have heard: the AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must understand AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to improve itself. It must understand the theory of artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence that was used to create it and its implementation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifics very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well. Then it must go about improving both the design and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its intelligence, a very complex task, as Ben Goertzel is aware.
