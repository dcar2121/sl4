Don't worry.  This topic will be finished by midnight Sunday (I've still 
<br>
got 10 min).
<br>
<p>First of all, I fully understand what I do and don't know about how current 
<br>
CPUs work.
<br>
Believe it or not, but I've actually designed an 8 bit CPU from the gates 
<br>
up.  I also know quite a bit about the physics of current chip design, but 
<br>
I'm the first person to say that I am not a hardware guy, and I don't know 
<br>
everything that I could.
<br>
<p>As far as what it's going to take to bring about a singularity, I don't 
<br>
believe any of us know ALL of the details.  It hasn't been done yet.
<br>
<p>As far as my feeling that something is missing from current AI... yes, I 
<br>
know it's mysticism, but hey I'm only human :).  As long as I don't blindly 
<br>
refuse to accept the idea that an &quot;I&quot; (self-awareness) can be built with 
<br>
current technology, then what harm is being done?  (On the other hand, if 
<br>
people refuse to accept the possibility that some hardware could be 
<br>
missing, that could lead to disaster.  I'm just saying, keep your mind open 
<br>
at least a little.)
<br>
<p>I do appreciate this group letting me express my opinions, and pointing out 
<br>
where they disagree.  It has certainly shown me the areas in communication 
<br>
where I am weak.  Then again, the goal of my original post was to introduce 
<br>
myself.  I'm sure that you would all agree that after this past weekend 
<br>
you'll know my name when you see it on an email (Success!). :)
