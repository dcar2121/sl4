<em>&gt; &gt;Yes, that's what I described, but by that description *I'm* hard-wired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Friendly, since this is one of the properties I strive for in my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;declarative philosophical content.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I don't think so.  *You* have decided to strive for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in your own life.  Your mother &amp; father didn't force it to be a primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal (although they may have tried, you actually had a choice).  Thus you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not &quot;hard-wired&quot; friendly in the same way that a FAI would be.
</em><br>
<p>I guess Eliezer's point may be that the AI ~does~ have a choice in his
<br>
plan -- the Friendliness supergoal is not an absolute irrevocable goal, it's
<br>
just a fact (&quot;Friendliness is the most important goal&quot;) that is given an
<br>
EXTREMELY high confidence so that the system has to gain a HUGE AMOUNT of
<br>
evidence to overturn it.
<br>
<p>Thus, the goal isn't &quot;hardwired&quot;, it's just &quot;brainwashed into the system
<br>
from birth with so much confidence that for a long while it seems like it's
<br>
hardwired.&quot;
<br>
<p>My contention is that a baby mind that thinks &quot;Friendless is the most
<br>
important goal&quot; with such confidence is going to have a hard time learning
<br>
how to behave in different contexts.
<br>
<p>Sure, you can build in high-confidence implication links of the form
<br>
&quot;keeping free memory adequate implies Friendliness&quot; (because system crashes
<br>
aren't nice for people), &quot;learning new things implies Friendliness&quot; (because
<br>
people like to hear about new things the system has learned), etc.  This is
<br>
what I think of as &quot;hard wiring a goal hierarchy&quot;, although Eliezer will say
<br>
it's not hard-wiring because the system eventually can override these links.
<br>
<p>But how does the system then learn, through its experience, that, &quot;When
<br>
working with X, learning new things implies Friendliness&quot;, but &quot;when working
<br>
with person Y, learning new things only insignificantly implies
<br>
friendliness&quot; ?  These relationships, learned through experience, will have
<br>
VASTLY lower confidence than the human-provided high-confidence ones.
<br>
<p>In short, this probabilistically almost-hard-wired goal hierarchy that
<br>
Eliezer seems to be proposing will drastically interfere with the process of
<br>
learning a richly textured hierarchy of context-dependent goals and
<br>
subgoals.  But really useful Friendliness comes out of this richly textured
<br>
hierarchy that's learned through experience...
<br>
<p>In the above paragraphs I'm sort of assuming a webmind-ish system in which
<br>
each relationship in the system is marked with at least 3 values, a strength
<br>
(how true is the relationship), a confidence (in the strength value), and an
<br>
importance (how useful is the relationship to the system), all valued in
<br>
[0,1]).  I'm assuming a Webmind-ish learning framework in which general and
<br>
specific relationships are invoked together, at once, in response to
<br>
situations....  It's possible that Eliezer has an alternate reasoning and
<br>
control framework in which his semi-hard-wired goal hierarchy doesn't cause
<br>
problems of the sort that I'm seeing.  However, in his writings he has not
<br>
articulated such a thing, yet.  My own suspicion is: Sure, one can make a
<br>
reasoning system in which semi-hard-wired goal system doesn't interfere with
<br>
context-dependent learning about goal interbalancing ... but this reasoning
<br>
system may be so rigid as not to be capable of very much learning at all!
