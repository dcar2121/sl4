</em><br>
<p>I think that we treat animals that display self awareness in a 
<br>
different way, because they have to potential for volition.  Animals 
<br>
like whales, dolphines, apes, et al. get treated pretty well, except 
<br>
for by some who think that they could get something out of it or are 
<br>
just lazy and don't care if they kill them off or not.
<br>
<p>Here is another thing:  an egoistic AI would only be interested in 
<br>
other individuals, not species.  Ve could care less what happens to 
<br>
humans, be ve might take an interest in a few humans and see to it 
<br>
that they are uploaded before all of the nearby space is turned into 
<br>
computronium.
<br>
<p>I think that the selfish AI and the selfless and altruistic AI would 
<br>
both be Friendly, but the selfish AI requires a lot more intelligence 
<br>
to keep it from becoming greedy on accident.  I think that we'll 
<br>
eventually be able to go with the selfish AIs, but at first we can't. 
<br>
But, I can't think of a really good reason to make selfish AIs if we 
<br>
have the unselfish and altruistic ones that exhibit the same 
<br>
behavior; it's just a matter of how everything works in the AI's 
<br>
mind.  Wait, what am I thinking?  As an AI matures, it understand 
<br>
that it has a self and just becomes selfish rather than selfless. 
<br>
The altruism is no longer needed, since selfishess will accomplish 
<br>
the same goal (so long as that goal is Friendliness).
