Hi all,
<br>
<p>Yesterday Onar [a Webmind co-founder who happens to be
<br>
from Norway] &amp; I met with the Norwegian VC firm
<br>
Venturos, and it went about as well as such a first
<br>
meeting can possibly go.  They stated from the outset,
<br>
that they do not invest in business plans, they invest
<br>
in great technologies with great people behind them. 
<br>
And we seemed to hit it off on a personal level.  Of
<br>
course, I am now far too jaded to get really excited
<br>
about a great first meeting, but nevertheless it is a
<br>
lot better than a BAD first meeting....  They are
<br>
interested in helping us to apply our technology to
<br>
the oil industry....
<br>
<p>I spent today wandering around Oslo (Onar flew home to
<br>
Stavanger), which in spite of being a very boring city
<br>
for a major European capital, has enough interesting
<br>
stuff for a full day of tourism.  A very active club
<br>
scene at night as well, heavily slanted toward house
<br>
music.  The entire Norwegian youth population also
<br>
seems oddly obsessed with kebabs.  After hours of
<br>
drinking and dancing, they all gather around the kebab
<br>
places and about 3 or 4 AM and stuff themselves with
<br>
greasy meat...
<br>
<p>Aside from the Vigland sculpture park, which was
<br>
pretty amazing, the highlight of the day's touring was
<br>
the Kon Tiki museum.  (Kon Tiki was the balsa raft on
<br>
which Thor Heyerdahl traveled from South America to
<br>
Polynesia in 1947, to prove his theory that  Polynesia
<br>
could have been settled by Incas way back when, even
<br>
though the Incas only had primitive rafts and not
<br>
sophisticated boats.)
<br>
<p>For some reason, sailing across the Pacific on a balsa
<br>
raft reminded me of building real AI using
<br>
contemporary computer software and hardware....  Not
<br>
impossible by any means ... from a certain point of
<br>
view even straightforward ... but a damn sight harder
<br>
than doing the same thing with more advanced
<br>
technology... (OK, so I`m twisted; I see the whole
<br>
world through Webmind-tinted glasses ;p)
