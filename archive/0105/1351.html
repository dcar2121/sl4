<em>&gt; 1) What can analog do that digital can't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Analog can store infinitely complex values in a single unit.  The value e
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be stored in full precision (from what I've read) in a quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer.  Digital systems are always limited by their resources (# of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flops, how many bits of storage does it have, etc...).  Sure, a digital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer can get very close to e, but it can never touch the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value
</em><br>
<p>i think you are missing the major reason why digital is being used as
<br>
opposed to analogue. you are right, with a digital system our storage (and
<br>
computation) is limited by the number of bits we have to store. so arbitrary
<br>
precision requires arbitrary number of &quot;components&quot; (bits of ram for
<br>
example). also true, that a single analogue component (say a capacitor, i
<br>
know it's not a good analogue component, but it can store a signal in the
<br>
electric field) can store an arbitrary precision number(it would have to be
<br>
scaled by some value, so we would need two per number). the problem is
<br>
twofold. first when you read you 'e' back from the storage, you must have a
<br>
very accurate voltmeter. so the precision of the computer now depends
<br>
completely on your ability to accurately measure voltage to a very large
<br>
number of significant digits. so if you cared about 100 digits of e, you
<br>
would need a voltmeter with 100 digit precision. which is a lot harder to
<br>
find than 100 flip-flops to represent e in a digital computer. the second
<br>
major factor is (always) noise. in a digital computer, an analogue signal
<br>
can take on only two values, so it can be distinguished from noise very
<br>
easily. if you use analogue components, somewhere along the line, the
<br>
precision of the signal you are storing/computing will be drowned out by the
<br>
noise of the system. so again, you cannot store a number more precise than
<br>
the noise.
<br>
<p>both of these problems have a very easy solution. use more &quot;components&quot;. if
<br>
you need to store 100 digits of e, but your voltmeter is only good at
<br>
reading 4, store the number in 25 &quot;components&quot;. and if your signal to noise
<br>
ratio is to high for you to read those digits, use 50, or 100. as you can
<br>
see, its very easy to transform an analogue system into a digital one. in
<br>
fact, because you are so limited by noise and instrument precision, you will
<br>
have to do it anyway.
<br>
<p>so in reality, digital and analogue are equivalent, one requires more bits,
<br>
the other, more precise instruments. bits are cheaper, easier to
<br>
manufacture, and scale.
