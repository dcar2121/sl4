Hello the list:
<br>
<p>I recently retired early from Tulane University where I was a professor of
<br>
Law and Philosophy.  My research interests scattered within legal and
<br>
political philosophy, and included modelling the structure of  legal and
<br>
moral reasoning.  In particular,  I was trying to develop an approach that
<br>
combined the standard deontic logic models with explications of goal based
<br>
reasoning using micro-economic models,  reasoning with principles and
<br>
analogies using voting models, and statutory construction\ interpretation
<br>
using Grice's account  of conversational meaning.  In other words, the
<br>
standard accounts in philosophy (rationality as deduction) leave out much of
<br>
how  lawyers argue about law and people argue about practical decisions, yet
<br>
most criticism of deductive theories attempt to avoid computational theories
<br>
altogether.  I think computational theories of rationality that go well
<br>
beyond deduction are possible, and necessary to AI.  The AI literature
<br>
devoted to legal reasoning that I read years ago was not helpful.  But the
<br>
descriptions of AI projects such as Webmind, and SIAI, are vastly more
<br>
promising.  I joined this list to find out more about these attempts to
<br>
create AI.
<br>
<p>My interests and expertise come from analytic philosophy, and not
<br>
programming.  My knowledge of the singularity and the other streams that
<br>
feed it (nano and genetics) come from reading popularized science, SF, and
<br>
philosophy of science.  I love having enough time to finally explore areas I
<br>
had to slight while I was teaching.  I suspect I will lurk more than post at
<br>
first, but I am excited about this list, and these issues and look forward
<br>
to learning from all of you.
<br>
<p>John Stick
