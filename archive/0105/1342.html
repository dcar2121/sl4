</em><br>
<p>No, unconditional friendship/altruism/etc. is evolutionarily real;
<br>
friendship is not a strict subgoal in the human mind.  See &quot;The Origins of
<br>
Virtue&quot; by Matt Ridley.
<br>
<p>I'm pretty sure I describe the evolutionary utility of unconditional
<br>
emotions in FAI at some point, probably the section on anthropomorphic
<br>
injunctions or anthropomorphic ethical injunctions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Secondly, you change what you mean by selfish.  In the first four
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sections of 4.2.2, selfishness seems to mean having a sense of self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, as a result, making decisions where benefit the self the most.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then, in 4.2.2.4, selfishness suddenly turns to become greediness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You try to seperate the ideas by suggesting human and bacterial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfishness, but that isn't very good, because you've overloaded the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term.  Bacteria are greedy, in that they have no sense of self, so do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever has the greatest immediate benefit.  Humans have a sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self, and thus think 'hmm, how will this affect *me*?'.  There is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kind of unchecked selfishness going on, though, because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts are different.  A person cannot be selfish and greedy at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time:  they are mutually exclusive.  Well, I should correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that:  an intelligence can have a sense of self but also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational and thus be greedy because of an inability to realize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects of having a self, therefore effectively not selfish.
</em><br>
<p>No, &quot;selfishness&quot; is being used in exactly the same sense in both places. 
<br>
By distinguishing between &quot;selfishness&quot; and &quot;greed&quot; you're assuming the
<br>
presence of a bunch of nearby social equals who will stomp you flat if you
<br>
get greedy.  A transhuman AI has no social equals, and the straight-line
<br>
projection says that a selfish transhuman AI with no other cognitive
<br>
complexity would act like a bacterium.  A selfish human acting like a
<br>
bacterium is being foolish, unless there are no other humans to object, in
<br>
which case selfishness translates directly to greed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, a lot of this is just a matter of diction, but I think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are very important, especially in a paper like FAI.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but for the record, I'm a perfectionist anyway; you can scold me
<br>
for anything, no matter how trivial.
