</em><br>
<p>If it is smarter than any human, and can talk, it could convince someone to let it
<br>
out.  I'm an intelligent fellow, but on at least one occasion, I've been conned out
<br>
of a substantial chunk of money by another intelligent fellow spinning plausible
<br>
lies.  How much easier would it be to fool me if the con artist was as much smarter
<br>
than me than I am to a 5-year-old?
<br>
<p>You could say, lets not let it out until we're really, really, really sure.  But it
<br>
could understand this, and pretend to be nice (or Friendly) until it's too late.
<br>
It's a much better to build it in such a way that we can convince ourselves of its
<br>
Friendliness by inspecting its data structures and/or controlling its design.
