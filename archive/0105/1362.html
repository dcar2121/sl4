</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is what I wrote.  At the moment, though, the Singularity 
<br>
couldn't happen that way.  The reason being that the AI would be 
<br>
slower than humans doing the same work.  It might take 18 months for 
<br>
humans to double the power of processors, but right now, if we got an 
<br>
AI working that's sole function was to work on making better 
<br>
processors (and being Friendly), on current hardware it would still 
<br>
take too long.  That's why there so much conern about programming AIs 
<br>
more effeciently (see the recent threads about Webmind) and creating 
<br>
more powerful computers.  I won't deny that a move to quantum 
<br>
computing or some other processor model *could* offer a jump in power 
<br>
by a few hundred orders of magnitude, but running on that hardware 
<br>
wouldn't be any different than running on the chips we have now, just 
<br>
at the same order of magnitude (well, more or less).
<br>
<p>I know that this is far below SL4, but I'll post it for the newbies' 
<br>
sakes.  What you are writing about is AI mysticism, the idea that 
<br>
there is some kind of magical ingredient you have to put in the soup 
<br>
to get an AI.  As much as the media, society, SF authors, et al. have 
<br>
spread this meme, there is no good reason to believe it to be true. 
<br>
While it's romantic to think that there is some magical piece to the 
<br>
puzzle of intelligence, and when it's found we'll get this amazing 
<br>
hard takeoff, the truth is that, if such a thing even exists, it's 
<br>
probably a line or two of code!
<br>
<p>But, if your believing in AI mysticism gets me a quantum computer 
<br>
sooner, then, by all means, ignore the previous paragraph.  ;^)
