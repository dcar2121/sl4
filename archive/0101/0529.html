<p>Well, I could be wrong about this (that is, I find it very easy to imagine
<br>
changing my mind).  Certainly if the *AI* says ve's not sure ve &quot;gets&quot;
<br>
Friendliness and wants to go slower, I wouldn't argue with that.  But I'm
<br>
also instinctively prejudiced against the idea of abusing the AI's
<br>
(temporary) trust to slow down the Singularity out of sheer nervous
<br>
anxiety and failure of nerve.  An artificial wait isn't risk-free.
<br>
<p>I believe three things:
<br>
<p>First, we should plan on winning this cleanly, completely, and with huge
<br>
margins of error.  When this is over, and some superintelligence tots up
<br>
my &quot;score&quot; a la Infocom, I want to hear that I could have spent one third
<br>
the effort on Friendship content and still done just fine, and that the
<br>
project never came anywhere near failing.
<br>
<p>Second, it is never possible to completely eliminate anxiety, and so the
<br>
mere cognitive presence of anxiety is not an adequate rationale for taking
<br>
some even riskier action just to discharge the anxiety, just to be &quot;doing
<br>
something about it&quot;.  I think this is a force often underestimated in
<br>
human psychology.
<br>
<p>Third, no matter what goes wrong or why, it will be my responsibility.
