<p>
I'm kind of reluctant to get into this at all, since (a) it's one of the
<br>
basics (outside our charter) and (b) debates about it perennially pop up
<br>
in the Extropian mailing list, and they never do any good there.  There
<br>
really should be a Singularity FAQ one of these days, and this really
<br>
should be one of the questions in it.
<br>
<p>As I understand the &quot;perceptions accelerate in time to keep up with the
<br>
Singularity, so there's never an event horizon&quot; concept, the idea seems to
<br>
be that in the year 2000, you can see to neurohacking-based intelligence
<br>
enhancement in 2010, and to human-machine interfaces in 2020, but you
<br>
can't see beyond 2020, so that's the Event Horizon.  And then, in 2010,
<br>
the neurohackers can see human-machine interfaces in 2020 and uploading in
<br>
2030, but they can't imagine what happens after that, so the Event Horizon
<br>
has moved ahead ten years in ten years.
<br>
<p>It's a pretty little picture, but totally false-to-fact for two major
<br>
reasons.  One, if neurohacks show up in 2010, then you can't see beyond
<br>
2010 because you can't take into account the effect of neurohacks. 
<br>
Singularity::Event Horizon should not be confused with
<br>
Singularity::Transcendence; the Event Horizon shows up in the *first
<br>
instant* that enhanced intelligence starts altering the picture,
<br>
regardless of how long after that it takes for all the progress indicators
<br>
to warp to OVERLOAD.
<br>
<p>Two, the &quot;moving Event Horizon&quot; theory is one of those slow-takeoff
<br>
scenarios that futurists just can't seem to get away from, where
<br>
everything happens neatly spaced-out over the course of human decades. 
<br>
The heart and soul of the Singularity is the change that comes with
<br>
increased *quality* of thinking - but increased speed of thinking also
<br>
plays an interesting part, from a practical perspective, anyway.  The
<br>
human timescale of 200hz neurons is not the only one in the Universe.
<br>
<p>What actually happens is that genetic engineering and neurohacking and
<br>
human-computer interfaces don't show up, because they'd show up in 2020,
<br>
and a hard takeoff occurs in SIAI's or Webmind's basement sometime in the
<br>
next ten years or so.  Even if the hardware for nanotechnology takes
<br>
another couple of weeks to manufacture, and even if you're asking the
<br>
newborn SI questions that whole time, no amount of explanation is going to
<br>
be equivalent to the real thing.  There still comes a point when the SI
<br>
says that the Introdus wavefront is on the way, and you sit there waiting
<br>
for the totally unknowable future to hit you in the next five seconds.
