</em><br>
<p>I *know* evolution is a general and powerful process.  It's the process
<br>
that produced me, and I acknowledge that.  I just think that intelligence
<br>
is a *more* general and *more* powerful process.  If evolution gets in the
<br>
way of my declarative goals, or the declarative goals of a Friendly AI,
<br>
then we'll *deal* with it, and without too much trouble.  The emergent
<br>
forces of evolution are unintelligent.  I can outsmart them; a Friendly
<br>
seed AI can outwit, outclass, and outgun them; a superintelligence can
<br>
simply crush the forces involved via brute brainpower.
<br>
<p>So when people argue that the character of post-Singularity reality is
<br>
*still* going to be determined by evolution, on the grounds that evolution
<br>
is going to sneak in and stomp on the goal systems of the transhumans that
<br>
will enact the new world, I just don't buy it.  Evolution has been
<br>
amazingly ineffective at stomping on my own goal systems when I don't want
<br>
it to... there are times when I want it to, which leads some people to
<br>
argue that it's all evolution anyway, but they're missing the point; there
<br>
are times when I *don't* want a specific evolutionary selection pressure
<br>
to determine my decisions, and at those times, I - the merely human
<br>
hardwired-brainware-guy! - can successfully resist those forces.
<br>
<p>Maybe, in the final analysis, I'm an altruist because despite the wide
<br>
range of selfish *behaviors* and selfish thoughts and emotions that are
<br>
evolutionary advantages, the nature of our society is such that the
<br>
evolutionary advantage lies with individuals who believe themselves to be
<br>
altruistic.  (As Ridley put it, there are advantages in issuing calls to
<br>
righteousness, but not to obeying them.)  Maybe I'm an altruist because
<br>
I'm an organism whose evolved *behaviors* are skewed almost entirely
<br>
towards selfishness, but whose evolved *beliefs* are skewed almost
<br>
entirely towards altruism, and thus I slid steadily into altruism as my
<br>
declarative cognition gained knowledge about evolutionary psychology and
<br>
used it to adjust my choices... who cares?  The upshot is, I've become
<br>
humanstyle Friendly, and my declarative cognition has successfully
<br>
outgunned all sorts of selection forces in the process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tend to buy into those theories of the origins of the universe, like John
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wheeler's, which argue that in the early universe, physical law itself evolved...
</em><br>
<p>&lt;WILD-EYED SPECULATION&gt;
<br>
<p>General Relativity looks to me suspiciously like a mutation from a
<br>
Newtonian ruleset.  Likewise for Special Relativity as an
<br>
existing-functionality-preserving mutation from flat space.  The
<br>
transition from quarks to baryons to atoms to molecules practically
<br>
screams of evolution, which is characterized by stochastic layers of
<br>
decreasing computational efficiency and increasing functional complexity. 
<br>
And the sheer hackiness of the transition from the quantum to the
<br>
classical leads me to believe that there's some kind of functional
<br>
adaptation here as well, perhaps involving the transition from a Monte
<br>
Carlo algorithm to actual quantum superposition and randomness.
<br>
<p>&lt;/WILD-EYED SPECULATION&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And there is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that the human brain is itself evolutionary (see Edelman's work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neural Darwinism; earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work by neuroscientists like Vernon Mountcastle and Szentogothai)
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Hedonic neurons, directed evolution in the human immune system...
<br>
like I said, evolution is a very powerful method.  Intelligence is *more*
<br>
powerful.  You just don't get to see that unless you have access to
<br>
general intelligence - not algorithms, not classical-AI heuristics, but
<br>
true general intelligence.  Wait until Webmind starts writing vis own
<br>
treatises on seed AI before you conclude that an evolutionary goal system
<br>
is the best possible method...
