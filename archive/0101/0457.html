All this at a micro-fraction of the orginal object's mass. The items in question would probably not know what hit them for a long time. Is that a Singularity?

<p>samantha:

Are you sure that is in Moravec's book?  I don't think he explicitly
<br>
mentions an SI sweeping through the universe much less claim that it
<br>
moves at near lightspeed. He does talk about Tipler's ideas (which are
<br>
much more inline with the above) in passing.  But I don't think he
<br>
explicitly talked SI or in these terms.  But perhaps my memory is
<br>
faulty.  Can you point me to this?   I don't believe he talks about
<br>
everything being recreated in virtuality as a serious eventuality
<br>
although he may dabble with it in his Mind Storms chapter.

<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;A thought occurs to me.  Perhaps there is no wall.  What I mean by this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; step with the advance of technology then there may be no point where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological explosion exceeds one's consciousness by such a factor as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to constitute an opaque wall.  The wall exists for us if we stand still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively while the technology moves forward.  Now it is quite likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we would not be able to dump old outmoded patterns and incorporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new ones fast enough to keep up with the freshly created sentiences, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at some point it is likely we would fall enough behind to experience the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wall.  Does this line of thinking make sense?  Can anything be made of
</em><br>
