</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all time without cripping the intellectual and self-evaluative power of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, when did I *ever*, *ever* say that I would establish Friendliness as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the supergoal by fiat?  For Friendliness to be stable, the AI needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-equivalent or transhuman &quot;strength of philosophical personality&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The definition has to be supported by the same shapers that support it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, at least as a starting point.  Remember that programmer independence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a design goal, and that the AI learns about Friendliness by tracing out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the causal chain that lies behind the volitional actions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers.  Eventually, Friendliness should be defined by reference to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the interactional product of functional forces that are shared by all, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost all, humans, at which point the AI or SI is programmer-independent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But I am *not* proposing to make AIs neurotic.  &quot;Friendliness is the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; important thing in the world&quot;, or rather, &quot;Friendliness is my goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; system&quot;, is a perfectly healthy state of mind for an AI.  And taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; massive preventative action if Friendliness is threatened doesn't require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a programmer assist; it's a natural consequence of the enormous unFriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consequences of an AI community drifting away from Friendliness.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; *never* &quot;make&quot; an AI fear anything; at most, I would ask politely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't see this as a healthy state.  It is an unexamined primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; belief.  No, much stronger than that.  It is the wired in basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything else.  Either it is forbidden and/or impossible to examine it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (by definition unhealthy) or it can be examined and found wanting.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; friendliness is desirable does not mean having it as an absolute is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either tenable or healthy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, Friendliness can be examined and found wanting.  This is a feature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a bug.  Nothing I said above is incompatible with that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So is the idea of a super-SI that rules everything else on the basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a more or less hardwired and presumably immutable Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; supergoal.  Said SI will be most unfriendly to those entities that do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not agree with its notion of what friendliness entails.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?  Why on Earth would ve care?  Taken at face value, this statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds remarkably anthropomorphic.  If you scream and hold protests about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evil dictator SI, the evil dictator SI will help you write your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banners, organize the march, think of good slogans, and fulfill any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop API requests that don't infringe on the living space of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens.
</em><br>
<p>Please, do not bother to label my questions &quot;anthropomorphic&quot;.   Why
<br>
would ve care?  Would ve care that some group was attempting to build
<br>
another SI of equal power?  Would ve care if humans would not accept any
<br>
of its advice and insisted on being left severely alone?  I am not
<br>
sure.  So I am asking.  Some things you have said lead me to believe
<br>
that there are definitely things the SI would be quite opposed to, even
<br>
violently so.  Would you clarify what those are? 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AFAIK it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not necessarily be &quot;friendly&quot; to those entities that simply wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strike out on their own outisde of its influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's the Sysop's superintelligent decision as to whether letting someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Outside would pose an unacceptable risk to innocent sentients.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal guess is that it does pose an unacceptable risk.  If something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't pose an unacceptable risk to innocent sentients, you should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to do it through the Sysop API.  That's practically what Friendliness
</em><br>
<p>What if onery sentiences simply do not want to have to pass all
<br>
decisions through this Sysop, no matter how intelligent and benign it
<br>
may be?  This is not an unexpected situation.  What will the Sysop do in
<br>
those cases?  What if some group of sentients decided that what the
<br>
Sysop considered an unacceptable risk was perfectly acceptable to them? 
<br>
Why would the Sysop want to forbid all entities that disagreed from
<br>
going somewhere outside its territory?  Can't stand the possibility of
<br>
competition or that something might not be under its metaphorical
<br>
thumb?  This brings up a question that I've never felt was adequately
<br>
answered.  How is it good for humans, being just the type of onery
<br>
independent creatures that we are, to have a benign Sysop rule over us? 
<br>
It strongly goes against the grain of the species.  How will the Sysop
<br>
deal with the likely mass revolt?  What will &quot;Friendliness&quot; dictate? 
<br>
Simply wait it out as it holds all the cards?  Will the Sysop be sure
<br>
this is actually being &quot;Friendly&quot; to the type of creatures we are?  Are
<br>
you sure?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; *is*.  If you want to play tourist in Betelguese, wrap a chunk of Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around yourself and take off.  You won't be able to torture the primitives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when you get there, but you'll be able to do anything else.
</em><br>
<p>What if I simply want an extended vacation from Sysop controlled space? 
<br>
<em>&gt;From what you have said, if I decide I want to extend that permanently
</em><br>
the Sysop will say no.  Interesting.  Do you honestly think humanity
<br>
will put up with this?  Do you honestly think it is ok to effectively
<br>
force them to by leaving no alternative?
