In Hans Moravec's Robot, the SuperIntelligences or SuperIntelligence; sweeps through the universe at near lightspeed, and over takes environments, objects, and civilizations. Their mass is converted into computational machinery and power. These environments, people, spaceships; are then re-created, entirely, in virtuality. All this at a micro-fraction of the orginal object's mass. The items in question would probably not know what hit them for a long time. Is that a Singularity?
<br>
<p>&quot;All in all, its just another brick in the Wall&quot;
<br>
--------------------------------
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A thought occurs to me.  Perhaps there is no wall.  What I mean by this
<br>
is that if one's own consciousness becomes augmented/expanded roughly in
<br>
step with the advance of technology then there may be no point where the
<br>
technological explosion exceeds one's consciousness by such a factor as
<br>
to constitute an opaque wall.  The wall exists for us if we stand still
<br>
relatively while the technology moves forward.  Now it is quite likely
<br>
that we would not be able to dump old outmoded patterns and incorporate
<br>
new ones fast enough to keep up with the freshly created sentiences, so
<br>
at some point it is likely we would fall enough behind to experience the
<br>
wall.  Does this line of thinking make sense?  Can anything be made of
<br>
it?&gt;&gt;
