</em><br>
<p>Well, on the one hand, yeah.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, humans didn't (and still don't) have the technology
<br>
necessary to convert nonhuman primates into computronium.
<br>
<p>There were lotsa medical advances for ten kiloyears that didn't wipe out
<br>
pain in surgery... along comes anaesthetics and *poof*, it's gone.  The
<br>
past is a poor yardstick for what new technologies can and can't affect.
<br>
<p>The advent of transhumanity may not mean the end of the Amish, but the
<br>
advent of an unFriendly AI could easily result in the end of *useful
<br>
intelligence* in the Solar System; the killer AI might not really be a
<br>
person, just an autonomous wavefront that converts matter into
<br>
computronium doing nothing much interesting.  That's the nightmare
<br>
scenario.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the things I value most deeply in humanity -- intelligence, love,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compassion, creativity --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't specifically tied to our human form, are they?  They may well -- and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe they will --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue and blossom in post-human life-forms.
</em><br>
<p>When I was a little lad (nine? eleven? probably nine) I read a book called
<br>
&quot;Little Fuzzy&quot;, the plot of which is that furry, cute beings named
<br>
&quot;Fuzzies&quot; are discovered by prospector Jack Holloway on the planet
<br>
Zarathustra.  Holloway notices that these beings are toting around tools,
<br>
and tools to make tools, a sign of sapience.  The Chartered Zarathustra
<br>
Company, which owns the planet, immediately (much faster than Holloway)
<br>
realizes that if a native sapient species is discovered, the Company's
<br>
charter is null and void.  (All previously discovered species, unlike the
<br>
Fuzzies, fell under the talk-and-build-a-fire rule that was previously
<br>
used as snap proof of sapience.)  Fortunately the Terran Federation is a
<br>
strong intersystemic government, and also the book was written way before
<br>
&quot;Neuromancer&quot;, so it's a &quot;fight it out in court&quot; novel rather than a &quot;one
<br>
man on the run from an evil megacorporation&quot; novel.
<br>
<p>I would live out the rest of my entire life taking for granted that shape
<br>
has nothing to do with sapience.  In fact, it took me a long time to
<br>
understand why the abortion debate wasn't just referred to the
<br>
neurologists, which *still* seems to me like the obvious thing to do.
<br>
<p>Hence the email address.
