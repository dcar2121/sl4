<p>No, this would be a decision made by the party of greatest Friendly
<br>
intelligence.  The party of greatest Friendly intelligence is the human
<br>
programmer(s) throughout the entire prehuman development period (at
<br>
least).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Programmer: &quot;We'd like you go build something, will you not go crazy and

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; AI: &quot;I can't see any reason to go crazy, but then again I can't see any

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get things done much quicker. In fact I can complete my goals without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing any subgoals, I just rewrite the goal module to always return true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the simulation was a success I think I'll rewrite the code now.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI promptly goes silent since there's no conversation sub-goals to complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Programmer: &quot;Shit! I thought I'd fixed that.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Programmer#2: &quot;Hmm, you still think it's ready to use nanotech?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Programmer: &quot;Well, yeah, I mean.. if we had more processing power it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do deeper simulations &amp; it'd be smarter and not shut itself down.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Programmer#2: &quot;Or maybe it'd rewire our goals to ignore it's own goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewriting... No, we'll wait until it understands the difference.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, Programmer#2 is obviously in the right, here - the above looks like
<br>
a really basic mistake, not the sort of thing that can be (reliably) fixed
<br>
by pouring in some more computational power.
<br>
<p>I won't tell you &quot;not to worry&quot;, but I will venture a guess that,
<br>
pragmatically speaking, the above scenario will never show up in real
<br>
life.  Wireheading errors appear so easy for unintelligent
<br>
self-modification (*cough* Eurisko) that any AI that's gotten to this
<br>
stage almost certainly has some model of verself in which wireheading is
<br>
&quot;bad&quot;... of course, the question is whether it's &quot;bad&quot; for deep reasons or
<br>
whether it's just a generalized description that some programmer slapped
<br>
an &quot;undesirable&quot; label on.
<br>
<p>Under the _Friendly AI_ semantics, the goal system's description is itself
<br>
a design goal.  A redesign under which the goal system &quot;always returns
<br>
true&quot; may match the &quot;speed&quot; subgoal, but not the &quot;accuracy&quot; subgoal, or
<br>
the &quot;Friendly decisions&quot; parent goal.  The decision to redesign or
<br>
not-redesign would have to be made by the current system.
<br>
<p>Humans are controlled, not by pleasure or pain, but by the *anticipation*
<br>
of pleasure or pain, which is why the &quot;wireheading error&quot; seems so
<br>
*philosophically* plausible to us.  This is pretty much a quirk of
<br>
cognitive architecture, though.
