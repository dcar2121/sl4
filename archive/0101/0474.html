<em>&gt; How is the description expressed?
</em><br>
<p>Well, the sensory correlate of Friendliness could be as simple as a human
<br>
typing &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.  This isn't Friendliness itself, any more than
<br>
the photons striking your eyeball are an actual coffee cup or whatever -
<br>
what you want to convey to the AI is that ve cares about the proximate
<br>
causes of the human typing &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;, not the actual typing.  If
<br>
the current semantics are capable of describing unknown causes, then this
<br>
is technically pretty simple; you tell the AI that there's an unknown
<br>
cause behind the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; and that Unknown factor is what really
<br>
counts.
<br>
<p>If the AI hypothesizes something wrong about the causality behind the
<br>
sensory feedback, you type in &quot;wrong&quot;.
<br>
<p>Once the AI understands enough about the causality to realize that &quot;right&quot;
<br>
and &quot;wrong&quot; are being typed in as the product of a human mind - in other
<br>
words, if the AI has some nontrivial image of Other Minds as a complex
<br>
process producing the typed letters on the keyboard - then the AI knows
<br>
enough about what the feedback process is *supposed* to be doing to regard
<br>
as undesirable a wirehead design alteration that produces sensory feedback
<br>
unassociated with the unseen Other Mind that is a human programmer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What's to stop goal drift over sucessive redesign iterations?
</em><br>
<p>External reference semantics, anchor/shaper semantics, and causal rewrite
<br>
semantics... can I put this question on hold until _Friendly AI_ is
<br>
finished?
<br>
<p>Actually, in practical terms, I think I can take a stab at answering this
<br>
concretely.  During development or a slowed takeoff, goal drift is
<br>
prevented by a human typing in &quot;wrong&quot;.  Past the point of hard takeoff,
<br>
if you've done your job right, goal drift is prevented by the AI correctly
<br>
predicting when an idealized human would type &quot;wrong&quot; and enfolding that
<br>
prediction into the design decisions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if you get to a situation whereby an improvement in design is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible by a slight reduction in accuracy compliance?
</em><br>
<p>Freeze until you can check with the human programmer or find a less mixed
<br>
improvement.
