<em>&gt; Again, no time for a thorough response to your paper, but here's a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You make a very good case that due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         -- AI's not evolving in a predator-prey situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         -- AI's not having to fight for mates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         -- AI's being able to remove from their own brains, things that they find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 objectionable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         -- AI's being able to introspect, and understand the roots and dynamics of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their behaviors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 more thoroughly than humans
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think this presumes a lot.  A la Moravec, I have no reason
<br>
to believe that AIs will not eventually compete for various types of
<br>
resources.  Competition should lead to some type of evolutionary path as
<br>
the AIs logically try cooperation, agression and other tactics and
<br>
evolve to better compete for limited computational space and other
<br>
resources.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I do not know that AIs will never find any reason to come to blows with other sentiences.  
</em><br>
<p>I do not know that ripping things out of one's mind is so terribly easy
<br>
as many things that have objectionable aspects also have beneficial
<br>
aspects and it is not so simple to get rid of one without giving up the
<br>
other. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and other related facts, AI's are probably going to be vastly mentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthier than humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without our strong inclinations toward aggression, jealousy, and so forth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure that mental health is appropriately delimited when
<br>
speaking of a non-human mentality with a radically different context. 
<br>
There is not a full enough understanding for judging mental health on a
<br>
cross-species basis. I suspect that any intelligent being that comes
<br>
into competition with others will eventually exhibit something quite
<br>
akin to aggression and jealousy. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, the case is weaker that this is going to make AI's consistently and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persistently friendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are 2 main points here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI's may well end up ~indifferent~ to humans.  My guess is that even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial AI's are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly programmed to be warm &amp; friendly to humans, eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;indifference to humans&quot; may become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an inexorable attractor...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There WILL be an evolutionary aspect to the growth of AI, because there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer resources and AI's can replicate themselves potentially infinitely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So there will be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; aspect to AI, meaning that AI's with greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiative, motivation, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be more likely to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At least, though, an AI will only need to retain those traits that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed for CURRENT survival;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlike we humans, who are saddled with all kinds of traits that were useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for survival in some long-past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.  This will remain their big advantage, as you point out, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly different language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Make that current and projected survival and I will agree.
