<p>
First, my disclaimer:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is one of my longest e-mails, this is not an actual essay,
<br>
that's just a categorization of the message. Thought I'd use the topic
<br>
system for once, just to point out that this e-mail is a personal thought,
<br>
not news or scientific facts. Stop me if &lt;SL4 or if you've already discussed
<br>
this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know if anyone has ever attempted to think in Rap Lin Rie (also
<br>
known as Dutton speedwords) or any other shorthand system. I am merely
<br>
proposing some systems and languages that might optimize human or artificial
<br>
thoughts (note: in this text, I use &quot;thought&quot; to refer to conscious thoughts
<br>
that are somehow verbalized by our &quot;internal narrator&quot;). I will focus on
<br>
human thought, since I would expect that an AI created by humans would be
<br>
rather anthropomorphic.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>I have often cursed my brain for constantly thinking my thoughts &quot;out loud&quot;.
<br>
I often feel that the verbalizing of thoughts is a bottleneck, that the
<br>
brain narrates after I've expressed the thoughts subconsciously, forcing me
<br>
to wait until it's done narrating before I can continue thinking. Sometimes
<br>
I get stuck in the middle of a thought simply because I can't find the word
<br>
I need or because the English word eludes me. Yes, Swedish is my first
<br>
language, but I often think and dream in English.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried to bypass this problem by concentrating on not verbalizing my
<br>
thoughts or by just interrupting the narrator and jump on to the next
<br>
thought, &quot;cut to the chase&quot; so to speak. I find that I can do without the
<br>
internal narrator for short whiles, but that I tend to lose my train of
<br>
thought and not reach any useful conclusion; my thoughts only fan out and
<br>
scatter wildly, a mildly Lovecraftesque sensation that reminds me of my
<br>
fever-induced nightmares and states of mind that seem frightening for no
<br>
apparent reason. It seems to me that my internal narrator has three main
<br>
purposes: 1) It helps me record and categorize my thoughts for future
<br>
reference, 2) filters out irrelevant thoughts, conjectures and memories, and
<br>
3) tries to direct the flow of thoughts towards some kind of conclusion.
<br>
(Perhaps it only performs function 1 or 2, and the other two follow from one
<br>
of those? Any thoughts?)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My conclusion is that a narrator is needed in order to organize
<br>
thoughts, and that to optimize the speed of conscious thought we need to
<br>
either optimize our language(s) or invent a shorthand language designed
<br>
specifically for thinking. There are a number of shorthand languages already
<br>
available; I will use Rap Lin Rie as an example here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those of you who haven't heard of RLR, here's a sentence from the
<br>
Gettysburg Address to give you an idea of how it works: &quot;T e alge oki &amp; oki
<br>
k w debi fa c.&quot; (&quot;It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
<br>
this.&quot;) Note that there is little nuance in RLR (&quot;oki &amp; oki&quot;) in order to
<br>
optimize for size and speed. Dutton obviously didn't care much about
<br>
aesthetics when he designed the language, he tried to construct an
<br>
international shorthand language. However useful it might be in writing, it
<br>
is hardly useful in speech. (How would you pronounce &amp;? &quot;Et&quot;? That means
<br>
&quot;little&quot; in RLR. What about &quot;w&quot;?) This makes it rather useless as shorthand
<br>
thought language as well, unless one can learn to think using only
<br>
typographical representations of words. Since I think it's possible, RLR
<br>
might be a good candidate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other existing languages that might be considered are Chinese or
<br>
Japanese or any non-inflected language. Sadly, the many nearly identical
<br>
words have resulted in awkward constructions to specify which meaning a
<br>
certain word has in a certain instance, such as &quot;look-see&quot; in some parts of
<br>
China (this might be obsolete). Anyway, most natural languages tend to have
<br>
the same average speed and size, which rules out most currently spoken
<br>
languages as thought optimizers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been toying with the idea of a parallell language, a language that
<br>
expresses many things in parallell. For example, I could be talking to John
<br>
about the weather while I talk to Jane about the mad cow disease. Sort of li
<br>
ke how DNA can be read in six different ways. Imagine the intricate
<br>
double-meanings and puns that would be possible in such a language! However,
<br>
I have no idea how to construct a parallell language. The closest I've come
<br>
is a kind of yin-yang version of Morse code, where you can either interpret
<br>
the message as usual or invert it, interpreting the pauses as beeps and the
<br>
beeps as pauses. For example, Long Beep (Short Pause) Long Beep also means
<br>
(Long Pause) Short Beep (Long Pause). However, this is obviously not a
<br>
parallell language; it's just two multiplexed channels.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I think it's pure lunacy to use only one of our five (six?)
<br>
senses when representing thoughts internally. Why not think in images,
<br>
odours, sounds, etc, combined? Why not construct a language that consists of
<br>
all the senses, and multiply current thinking speed with a factor of five
<br>
(six?)? In such a language, each concept is represented by a sensation. It
<br>
would probably be impractical, and it wouldn't help me at all, since my
<br>
problem is remembering certain words; in this language, the vocabulary would
<br>
be huge, since the idea is to have one sensation for every single concept.
<br>
<p>I'd love to read any thoughts on this. I think that this is relevant to SL4
<br>
because I feel that to achieve transhuman intelligence we have to understand
<br>
the limitations of the mind and try to overcome them. Has anyone else given
<br>
this matter some thought? Please reply -- privately, if the subject is
<br>
buzzed. (Always the optimist.)
