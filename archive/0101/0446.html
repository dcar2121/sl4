<p>The wall is always moving.  Today it is situated just a tinny bit 
<br>
_after_ the Singularity.  Why?  Do we know what the Singularity is? 
<br>
Yes.  Have we begun to *speculate* on what its effects might be? 
<br>
Yes.  Do we know (in the sense that we know that the Singularity is 
<br>
coming) what will happen afterward?  No.  So, right now we can make 
<br>
guesses at what it might be like to be posthuman on a Singularity 
<br>
computer, but those are just guesses.  The wall is the point that we 
<br>
can't see beyond.  At the moment, short term effects of the 
<br>
Singularity can be quasi known and guesses are made at the long term, 
<br>
but in 10 years we may already be able to see technologies that will 
<br>
come after the Singularity.  Before Vinge thought of the Singularity, 
<br>
maybe it was AI that seemed to be the point where everything would 
<br>
change, or nanotech, or whatever.  As much as the Singularity will 
<br>
change things, the past trend suggest that something even more 
<br>
amazing lies beyond that.  Luckily for this list, the person that 
<br>
figures out whatever the next thing is probably is sitting somewhere, 
<br>
reading my post right now.  Either that, or ve has yet to be born.
<br>
<p>At any rate, my main idea is that the wall is moving all of the time. 
<br>
Today the Singularity seems like it will change everything, and it 
<br>
indead may, but as we get closer to it and as other technologies 
<br>
develop, it may not be as socking as it seems now, since we will have 
<br>
already thought up more shocking stuff (and have moved on to the sl5 
<br>
list).
