<p>'Gald you brought this up, Anders. I'm not an economist, but I've taken
<br>
enough economics courses in college and read enough econ books (my fav being
<br>
Freidman's _The Machinery of Freedom_) to suspect that even an SI will
<br>
employ some form of economic analysis (e.g., costs vs. benefits). If there
<br>
are multiple SI agents, then some kind of exchange system will almost
<br>
certainly develop (either as a market or as conflict). The interaction of
<br>
(unaugmented) humans with SIs will also likely follow a game theoretic form,
<br>
I think (try to find a copy of the out-of-print classic _Superior Beings_ by
<br>
Brams for a deep analysis of this interactions).
<br>
<p>Ludwig von Mises, perhaps the greatest philosopher of free market economics,
<br>
did not anticipate the technological Singularity. However, in his book
<br>
_Human Action_ he did include a section about the singular nature of
<br>
economics, where he cautions about the lack of proofs in economics (which
<br>
should serve to keep us from arguing about the claims on either side of the
<br>
issues raised above for more than, say, two or three months.;) I thought it
<br>
would be appropriate to quote it here (from: <a href="http://www.mises.org">http://www.mises.org</a>):
<br>
<p>1. The Singularity of Economics
<br>
<p>&quot;What assigns economics its peculiar and unique position in the orbit both
<br>
of pure knowledge and of the practical utilization of knowledge is the fact
<br>
that its particular theorems are not open to any verification or
<br>
falsification on the ground of experience. Of course, a measure suggested by
<br>
sound economic reasoning results in producing the effects aimed at, and a
<br>
measure suggested by faulty economic reasoning fails to produce the ends
<br>
sought. But such experience is always still historical experience, i.e., the
<br>
experience of complex phenomena. It can never, as has been pointed out,
<br>
prove or disprove any particular theorem.[1] The application of spurious
<br>
economic theorems results in undesired consequences. But these effects never
<br>
have that undisputable power of conviction which the experimental facts in
<br>
the field of the natural sciences provide. The ultimate yardstick of an
<br>
economic theorem's correctness or incorrectness is solely reason unaided by
<br>
experience.
<br>
The ominous import of this state of affairs is that it prevents the naive
<br>
mind from recognizing the reality of the things economics deals with. &quot;Real&quot;
<br>
is, in the eyes of man, all that he cannot alter and to whose existence he
<br>
must adjust his actions if he wants to attain his ends. The cognizance of
<br>
reality is a sad experience. It teaches the limits on the satisfaction of
<br>
one's wishes. Only reluctantly does man resign himself to the insight that
<br>
there are things, viz., the whole complex of all causal relations between
<br>
events, which wishful thinking cannot alter. Yet sense experience speaks an
<br>
easily perceptible language. There is no use arguing about experiments. The
<br>
reality of experimentally established facts cannot be contested.
<br>
But in the field of praxeological knowledge neither success nor failure
<br>
speaks a distinct language audible to everybody. The experience derived
<br>
exclusively from complex phenomena does not bar escape into interpretations
<br>
based on wishful thinking. The naive man's propensity to ascribe omnipotence
<br>
to his thoughts, however confused [p. 863] and contradictory, is never
<br>
manifestly and unambiguously falsified by experience. The economist can
<br>
never refute the economic cranks and quacks in the way in which the doctor
<br>
refutes the medicine man and the charlatan. History speaks only to those
<br>
people who know how to interpret it on the ground of correct theories.&quot;
<br>
