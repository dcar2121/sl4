<em>&gt; Samantha, although I agree with your position about fuzziness vs rigid

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Eli's point I think was a response to a perceived anthropomorphism in your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line of reasoning. If that was the case, then it was a valid response.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, judging from your previous posts I doubt that was what you had in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind.
</em><br>
<p>That is reading a lot into the comment that doesn't seem to be there. 
<br>
That may be your perception or even his perception but that is not what
<br>
was said. I was simply referring to the apparent fact in human societies
<br>
(this isn't simply antromorphism on my part as those are the only
<br>
intelligent entities we have at hand to draw inferences from currently)
<br>
it is quite important to have multiple agents with variant agendas and
<br>
viewpoints that interact.  This seems to be true even in non-intelligent
<br>
living systems where diversity of individual units becomes important
<br>
when the system faces stresses beyond its mainline patterns.  If this is
<br>
a general pattern in complex adaptive systems then it is a valid
<br>
question how the SI will generate alternate
<br>
personas/viewpoints/goal-sets when faced with the limits of its mainline
<br>
responses or if it will or should.  
<br>
<p>I don't think an absurd analogy helped move the discussion forward.  Do
<br>
you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally I find it difficult to know if the architecture would fall apart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply because I have difficulty modelling it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This is a good point.  When will we see mock-ups of what is proposed? 
<br>
Or is this possible?
