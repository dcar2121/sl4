</em><br>
<p>The key word in that paragraph is &quot;potentially&quot;.  See below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In introducing an artificial
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; probability of error is great enough to warrant deliberate slowness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gambling on the possibility that the AI wouldn't just zip off to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superintelligence and Friendliness.  With six billion lives on the line, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; little delay may be justified, but it has to be the absolute minimum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; delay.  Unless major problems turn up, a one-week delay would be entering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hitler/Stalin territory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  It has to be enough delay to be as certain as possible that it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not eat the 6 billion people for lunch.  In the face of that as even a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remote possibility there is no way it is sane to speak of being a Hitler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you delay one week.  Please recalibrate on this.
</em><br>
<p>If I take a vacation to decompress, *today*, I don't feel guilty; that
<br>
comes under the classification of sane self-management.  Doing a one-week
<br>
delay *after* the AI reaches the point of hard takeoff... I guess my mind
<br>
just processes it differently.  It's like the difference between saying
<br>
that &quot;ExI is a more effective charity than CARE&quot;, and actually looting
<br>
CARE's bank account.  Logically, giving eight dollars of your money to ExI
<br>
instead of CARE should have the same consequences as stealing eight
<br>
dollars from CARE instead of giving it to ExI... but, morally, that's not
<br>
how it works.
<br>
<p>Before the AI reaches hard takeoff, it's your time that you're investing
<br>
in the AI, to the benefit of everyone in the world perhaps, but yours to
<br>
invest in whatever payoff-maximizing strategy seems best.  After the AI
<br>
reaches the potential for hard takeoff, it's *their* time - and lives -
<br>
that you're stealing.
