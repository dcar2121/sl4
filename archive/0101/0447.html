</em><br>
<p>A thought occurs to me.  Perhaps there is no wall.  What I mean by this
<br>
is that if one's own consciousness becomes augmented/expanded roughly in
<br>
step with the advance of technology then there may be no point where the
<br>
technological explosion exceeds one's consciousness by such a factor as
<br>
to constitute an opaque wall.  The wall exists for us if we stand still
<br>
relatively while the technology moves forward.  Now it is quite likely
<br>
that we would not be able to dump old outmoded patterns and incorporate
<br>
new ones fast enough to keep up with the freshly created sentiences, so
<br>
at some point it is likely we would fall enough behind to experience the
<br>
wall.  Does this line of thinking make sense?  Can anything be made of
<br>
it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At any rate, my main idea is that the wall is moving all of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today the Singularity seems like it will change everything, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indead may, but as we get closer to it and as other technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop, it may not be as socking as it seems now, since we will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already thought up more shocking stuff (and have moved on to the sl5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list).
</em><br>
<p><p>This is somewhat the same sort of thing.  The singularity to mass-human
<br>
may come a lot sooner than the singularity comes for you or I.
