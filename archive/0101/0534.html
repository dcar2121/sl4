</em><br>
<p>Advice - freely offered, freely rejected.
<br>
<p>Build another SI of equal intelligence - sure, as long as you build ver
<br>
inside the Sysop.
<br>
<p>Build an Ultraweapon of Megadeath and Destruction so you can see how it
<br>
works - sure, as long as there's a bit of Sysop somewhere inside the
<br>
trigger making sure you don't point it at the Amish communities on Old
<br>
Earth.
<br>
<p>Build an Ultraweapon that you can aim anywhere, with no Sysopmatter
<br>
(visible or not) anywhere near it - you might still be able to get away
<br>
with this, as long as the Sysop can predict the future with total
<br>
certainty and predict that you'll never abuse the Ultraweapon, regardless
<br>
of any external influences you encounter.  Probably no human, even Gandhi,
<br>
is subject to this prediction, but an uploaded Gandhi turned transhuman
<br>
might be.
<br>
<p>Build an Ultraweapon for the purpose of abusing it - sorry, API error.
<br>
<p>Under absolutely none of these circumstances does the Sysop need to strike
<br>
back at you.  Ve just gives you an API error.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It's the Sysop's superintelligent decision as to whether letting someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Outside would pose an unacceptable risk to innocent sentients.  My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personal guess is that it does pose an unacceptable risk.  If something
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; able to do it through the Sysop API.  That's practically what Friendliness

</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if onery sentiences simply do not want to have to pass all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions through this Sysop, no matter how intelligent and benign it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be?  This is not an unexpected situation.  What will the Sysop do in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those cases?  What if some group of sentients decided that what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop considered an unacceptable risk was perfectly acceptable to them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would the Sysop want to forbid all entities that disagreed from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going somewhere outside its territory?  Can't stand the possibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition or that something might not be under its metaphorical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thumb?
</em><br>
<p>For all I know, it's entirely okay to fork off and run under your own
<br>
Sysop as long as that Sysop is also Friendly.  (People who chime in about
<br>
how this would dump us into a Darwinian regime may take this as an
<br>
argument against Sysop splitting.)  The static uploads may even form their
<br>
own polises with different operating systems and rules, with the
<br>
underlying Sysop merely acting to ensure that no citizen can be trapped
<br>
inside a polis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How is it good for humans, being just the type of onery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent creatures that we are, to have a benign Sysop rule over us?
</em><br>
<p>This brings up a point I keep on trying to make, which is that the Sysop
<br>
is not a ruler; the Sysop is an operating system.  The Sysop may not even
<br>
have a public personality as such; our compounded &quot;wishes about wishes&quot;
<br>
may form an independent operating system and API that differs from citizen
<br>
to citizen, ranging from genie interfaces with a personality, to an Eganic
<br>
&quot;exoself&quot;, to transhumans that simply dispense with the appearance of an
<br>
interface and integrate their abilities into themselves, like motor
<br>
functions.  The fact that there's a Sysop underneath it all changes
<br>
nothing; it just means that your interface (a) can exhibit arbitrarily
<br>
high levels of intelligence and (b) will return some kind of error if you
<br>
try to harm another citizen.
<br>
<p>Things might be different in the transhuman spaces - I can guess for
<br>
static uploads only.  And the above scenario may not be true for everyone,
<br>
but it is certainly much more likely to be true for people who resent the
<br>
&quot;rule&quot; of the Sysop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It strongly goes against the grain of the species.  How will the Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with the likely mass revolt?  What will &quot;Friendliness&quot; dictate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simply wait it out as it holds all the cards?
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  Again, for static uploads, the Sysop won't *necessarily* be a
<br>
dominant feature of reality, or even a noticeable one.  For sysophobic
<br>
statics, the complexity of the future would be embedded entirely in social
<br>
interactions and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will the Sysop be sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is actually being &quot;Friendly&quot; to the type of creatures we are?
</em><br>
<p>If it's what we say we want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you sure?
</em><br>
<p>Of course not.  You could be right and I could be wrong, in which case -
<br>
if I've built well - the Sysop will do something else, or the seed AI will
<br>
do something other than become Sysop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; *is*.  If you want to play tourist in Betelguese, wrap a chunk of Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; around yourself and take off.  You won't be able to torture the primitives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when you get there, but you'll be able to do anything else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What if I simply want an extended vacation from Sysop controlled space?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From what you have said, if I decide I want to extend that permanently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Sysop will say no.  Interesting.  Do you honestly think humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will put up with this?  Do you honestly think it is ok to effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force them to by leaving no alternative?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I think that, if the annoyance resulting from pervasive forbiddance
<br>
is a necessary subgoal of ruling out the space of possibilities in which
<br>
citizenship rights are violated, then it's an acceptable tradeoff.
<br>
<p>Please note that in your scenario, people are not all free free free as a
<br>
bird.  In your scenario, you can take an extended vacation from Sysop
<br>
space, manufacture a million helpless sentients, and then refuse to let
<br>
*them* out of Samantha space.  You can take actions that would make them
<br>
*desperate* to leave Samantha space and they still won't be able to go,
<br>
because the Sysop that would ensure those rights has gone away to give you
<br>
a little personal space.  I daresay that in terms of the total integral
<br>
over all sentients and their emotions, the Samantha scenario involves many
<br>
many more sentients feeling much more intense desire to escape control.
<br>
<p>&quot;It is never possible to completely eliminate anxiety, and so the
<br>
mere cognitive presence of anxiety is not an adequate rationale for taking
<br>
some even riskier action just to discharge the anxiety, just to be 'doing
<br>
something about it'.  I think this is a force often underestimated in
<br>
human psychology.&quot;
