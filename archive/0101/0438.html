<p>
Please note: many of us don't generally think in words or languages in any
<br>
explicit way, thinking instead
<br>
visually or without any sensory metaphor
<br>
<p>Different personal metaphors for thinking have been explored by
<br>
psychologists many times over
<br>
the past century
<br>
<p>I remember in Jacques Hadamard's excellent book &quot;The Psychology of
<br>
Mathematical Invention&quot;
<br>
he touched on this point.  Not very many mathematicians were verbal
<br>
thinkers.
<br>
<p>It's also worth noting that much Eastern spiritual tradition is based on
<br>
&quot;stopping the internal dialogue.&quot;

<em>&gt; Subject: ESSAY: Optimizing thoughts for speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, my disclaimer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Although it is one of my longest e-mails, this is not an actual essay,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's just a categorization of the message. Thought I'd use the topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system for once, just to point out that this e-mail is a personal thought,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not news or scientific facts. Stop me if &lt;SL4 or if you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already discussed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I don't know if anyone has ever attempted to think in Rap Lin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rie (also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known as Dutton speedwords) or any other shorthand system. I am merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposing some systems and languages that might optimize human or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts (note: in this text, I use &quot;thought&quot; to refer to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are somehow verbalized by our &quot;internal narrator&quot;). I will focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human thought, since I would expect that an AI created by humans would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather anthropomorphic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have often cursed my brain for constantly thinking my thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;out loud&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I often feel that the verbalizing of thoughts is a bottleneck, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain narrates after I've expressed the thoughts subconsciously,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to wait until it's done narrating before I can continue thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get stuck in the middle of a thought simply because I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need or because the English word eludes me. Yes, Swedish is my first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language, but I often think and dream in English.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I've tried to bypass this problem by concentrating on not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verbalizing my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts or by just interrupting the narrator and jump on to the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, &quot;cut to the chase&quot; so to speak. I find that I can do without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal narrator for short whiles, but that I tend to lose my train of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought and not reach any useful conclusion; my thoughts only fan out and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scatter wildly, a mildly Lovecraftesque sensation that reminds me of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fever-induced nightmares and states of mind that seem frightening for no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent reason. It seems to me that my internal narrator has three main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes: 1) It helps me record and categorize my thoughts for future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference, 2) filters out irrelevant thoughts, conjectures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) tries to direct the flow of thoughts towards some kind of conclusion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Perhaps it only performs function 1 or 2, and the other two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow from one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of those? Any thoughts?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     My conclusion is that a narrator is needed in order to organize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts, and that to optimize the speed of conscious thought we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either optimize our language(s) or invent a shorthand language designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically for thinking. There are a number of shorthand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available; I will use Rap Lin Rie as an example here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     For those of you who haven't heard of RLR, here's a sentence from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gettysburg Address to give you an idea of how it works: &quot;T e alge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oki &amp; oki
</em><br>
<em>&gt; k w debi fa c.&quot; (&quot;It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.&quot;) Note that there is little nuance in RLR (&quot;oki &amp; oki&quot;) in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimize for size and speed. Dutton obviously didn't care much about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetics when he designed the language, he tried to construct an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international shorthand language. However useful it might be in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is hardly useful in speech. (How would you pronounce &amp;? &quot;Et&quot;? That means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;little&quot; in RLR. What about &quot;w&quot;?) This makes it rather useless as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shorthand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought language as well, unless one can learn to think using only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; typographical representations of words. Since I think it's possible, RLR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be a good candidate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Other existing languages that might be considered are Chinese or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japanese or any non-inflected language. Sadly, the many nearly identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words have resulted in awkward constructions to specify which meaning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain word has in a certain instance, such as &quot;look-see&quot; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; China (this might be obsolete). Anyway, most natural languages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tend to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same average speed and size, which rules out most currently spoken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; languages as thought optimizers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I've been toying with the idea of a parallell language, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expresses many things in parallell. For example, I could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking to John
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the weather while I talk to Jane about the mad cow disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sort of li
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ke how DNA can be read in six different ways. Imagine the intricate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; double-meanings and puns that would be possible in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language! However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no idea how to construct a parallell language. The closest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a kind of yin-yang version of Morse code, where you can either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the message as usual or invert it, interpreting the pauses as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beeps and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beeps as pauses. For example, Long Beep (Short Pause) Long Beep also means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Long Pause) Short Beep (Long Pause). However, this is obviously not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallell language; it's just two multiplexed channels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Personally, I think it's pure lunacy to use only one of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; five (six?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senses when representing thoughts internally. Why not think in images,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odours, sounds, etc, combined? Why not construct a language that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consists of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the senses, and multiply current thinking speed with a factor of five
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (six?)? In such a language, each concept is represented by a sensation. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would probably be impractical, and it wouldn't help me at all, since my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is remembering certain words; in this language, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vocabulary would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be huge, since the idea is to have one sensation for every single concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd love to read any thoughts on this. I think that this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I feel that to achieve transhuman intelligence we have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the limitations of the mind and try to overcome them. Has anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this matter some thought? Please reply -- privately, if the subject is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buzzed. (Always the optimist.)
