<p>
Evolution is the simplest way for a system to evolve greater complexity in
<br>
the absence of intelligence.  Not the best way - the simplest way.  The
<br>
first way hit upon.  Evolution prevails, not because it's better, or best,
<br>
or morally right in any way whatsoever, but because it's there and there
<br>
are no forces acting against it.
<br>
<p>Luke: &quot;Is the Dark side stronger?&quot; 
<br>
Yoda: &quot;No! no...quicker, easier, more seductive...&quot; 
<br>
<p>Evolution is not the brilliant idea of solving the problem more
<br>
effectively by subtracting intelligence; evolution is the result of adding
<br>
the *constraint* that the problem must be solved in a way that does not
<br>
invoke intelligence.
<br>
<p>I'm steeped in the antiteleological precautions of evolutionary
<br>
psychology.  You're spending your time with the computer science version
<br>
of evolution - one in which &quot;evolutionary programming&quot; is a brilliant way
<br>
to overcome some of the inherent limits of human intelligence using
<br>
processes that don't invoke general cognition.  (Of course, the processes
<br>
*can't* invoke general cognition because nobody's programmed that yet.)
<br>
<p>Evolutionary programming is not superior to a seed AI with a modality,
<br>
2Ghz transistors, and patience; but EP can reach spaces inaccessible to a
<br>
human, with no modality, who operates in 200hz time and is easily bored
<br>
and is especially bored by simple things; a human who instinctively tries
<br>
to use all those parallel neurons on each design attempt, and has neither
<br>
the patience nor the time to use 10^14 synapses to test lots of simple
<br>
local optimizations.
<br>
<p>Evolution is not something I like.  Evolution is something that *is*. 
<br>
Moreover, it's a something-that-is that I think humanity (and our new
<br>
friends) should move away from.  I think evolution is something we should
<br>
grow out of as we grow up.  Evolution is not the best way, or even a good
<br>
way, it's simply the first way.  In casting aside evolution, we will lose
<br>
nothing, gain everything, because there is nothing whatsoever that
<br>
evolution can do that can't be done by a sufficiently powerful general
<br>
intelligence.  Humans are not &quot;sufficiently powerful&quot;, but a seed AI is.
<br>
<p>Evolution is what happens in the *total absence* of morality or
<br>
intelligence.  I'm not talking about the evolution of moral and
<br>
intelligent beings, which has been known to happen; I mean that morality
<br>
and intelligence have no influence on the systemic structure of evolution
<br>
itself.  Evolution is the way things are because it's the first way that
<br>
unintelligent reality hits upon.  Evolution, like death, like pain, like
<br>
the constant struggle to survive, is a part of default-state reality that
<br>
humanity shall CONQUER as we attain our place in the Universe.  I believe
<br>
in the *triumph* of altruistic general intelligence over evolution as part
<br>
of the Singularity.
<br>
<p>I think that's the underlying reason why we disagree about the ability of
<br>
evolution to affect the Singularity: you see evolution as a force that's
<br>
strong and necessary; I see it as a force that's pretty weak compared to
<br>
intelligence, and was never all that attractive to begin with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because all my experimentation with genetic algorithms shows that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for evolutionary processes, initial conditions are fairly irrelevant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The system evolves fit things that live in large basins of attraction,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no matter where you start them.
</em><br>
<p>Well, yeah, sure... in the total absence of moral intelligence.  What else
<br>
would you expect?
