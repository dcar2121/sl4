<p>
this is similar to a thought i had when i was first introduced to the techno 
<br>
singularity. if your perceptions change fast enough, you'll always be able 
<br>
to &quot;keep up&quot; with the accelerating paradigm shifting, as your viewpoint will 
<br>
coattail with the acceleration itself(hopefully). but as we're human, and 
<br>
kinda bad about change, perhaps rather than a wall, we'll experience a kind 
<br>
of fogginess. as our perceptions slow down and lose ground as compared to 
<br>
the baseline neccesary to look forward. (sort of a perceptual Doppler 
<br>
effect).
<br>
<p>i'm reminded of polygon fog in some 3d games, which is used to save computer 
<br>
horsepower. perhaps our perceptions, like the polygon draw rate, will need 
<br>
to do what they can, simplifying or ignoring some things in the future, with 
<br>
the less &quot;powerful&quot; or up to date perceptions having worse and worse 
<br>
fogging, until it does become a wall for some people. and only an 
<br>
inconvenience for others.
<br>
<p>as mysterious and exciting as the singularity is, i, in the interest of 
<br>
science and getting the right story the first time, would like to keep my 
<br>
eyes open during it.

<p><p><em>&gt;From: Samantha Atkins A thought occurs to me. Perhaps there is no wall. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What I mean by this is that if one's own consciousness becomes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;augmented/expanded roughly in step with the advance of technology then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there may be no point where the technological explosion exceeds one's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness by such a factor as to constitute an opaque wall. The wall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exists for us if we stand still relatively while the technology moves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forward. Now it is quite likely that we would not be able to dump old 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outmoded patterns and incorporate new ones fast enough to keep up with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freshly created sentiences, so at some point it is likely we would fall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough behind to experience the wall. Does this line of thinking make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense? Can anything be made of it?
