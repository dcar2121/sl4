&lt;snip simple Programmer - AI dialog&gt;

</em><br>
<p>Yeah, of course, just a little light entertainment to illustrate the basic
<br>
case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I won't tell you &quot;not to worry&quot;, but I will venture a guess that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pragmatically speaking, the above scenario will never show up in real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  Wireheading errors appear so easy for unintelligent
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage almost certainly has some model of verself in which wireheading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;bad&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>Yes I'd agree in general, but I don't see any reason not to keep looking for
<br>
problems. I can't chase you further on this point because it depends on your
<br>
implementation specifics.
<br>
<p>Human drug addicts are more intelligent than Eurisko, and they know it's
<br>
bad, but that doesn't stop them. Intelligence and forewarning are no
<br>
guarantee. I will admit though that human design is probably largely to
<br>
blame.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; of course, the question is whether it's &quot;bad&quot; for deep reasons or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether it's just a generalized description that some programmer slapped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an &quot;undesirable&quot; label on.
</em><br>
<p>Well, what's bad to just a collection of quarks? There's the unresolved
<br>
issue of, dare I say it, qualia &lt;shudder&gt;. I hope it resolves itself as a
<br>
non-issue just as 'life-force' did in biology, but you have to admit it's a
<br>
tough one.
<br>
<p>It could be that qualia appears &amp; does something unpredicted to the goal
<br>
system. As we don't fully understand how qualia manifests itself, it'd be
<br>
wise to keep checking. I suspect a major redesign would be needed when/if
<br>
qualia comes into play.
<br>
<p>Since qualia tends to appear only in systems sufficiently complex and
<br>
self-referential, there may be higher qualia class 'things' that only appear
<br>
at higher levels of complexity. It's probably not worth me telling you to
<br>
look out for those, but I'll say it anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Under the _Friendly AI_ semantics, the goal system's description is itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a design goal.  A redesign under which the goal system &quot;always returns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true&quot; may match the &quot;speed&quot; subgoal, but not the &quot;accuracy&quot; subgoal, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;Friendly decisions&quot; parent goal.  The decision to redesign or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not-redesign would have to be made by the current system.
</em><br>
<p>The 'always returns true' case was just a joke, it wouldn't fool anyone on
<br>
this list for a second. It's useful as a common point of reference to ground
<br>
the conversation.
<br>
<p>How do you measure the 'accuracy' of the goal system's description?
<br>
How is the description expressed?
<br>
What's to stop goal drift over sucessive redesign iterations?
<br>
What if you get to a situation whereby an improvement in design is only
<br>
possible by a slight reduction in accuracy compliance? Have you allowed for
<br>
stopping to be a valid solution?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
Dale.
