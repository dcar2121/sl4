</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Um, when did I *ever*, *ever* say that I would establish Friendliness as
<br>
the supergoal by fiat?  For Friendliness to be stable, the AI needs
<br>
human-equivalent or transhuman &quot;strength of philosophical personality&quot;. 
<br>
The definition has to be supported by the same shapers that support it in
<br>
me, at least as a starting point.  Remember that programmer independence
<br>
is a design goal, and that the AI learns about Friendliness by tracing out
<br>
the causal chain that lies behind the volitional actions of the
<br>
programmers.  Eventually, Friendliness should be defined by reference to
<br>
the interactional product of functional forces that are shared by all, or
<br>
almost all, humans, at which point the AI or SI is programmer-independent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But I am *not* proposing to make AIs neurotic.  &quot;Friendliness is the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important thing in the world&quot;, or rather, &quot;Friendliness is my goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system&quot;, is a perfectly healthy state of mind for an AI.  And taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; massive preventative action if Friendliness is threatened doesn't require
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *never* &quot;make&quot; an AI fear anything; at most, I would ask politely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see this as a healthy state.  It is an unexamined primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief.  No, much stronger than that.  It is the wired in basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else.  Either it is forbidden and/or impossible to examine it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (by definition unhealthy) or it can be examined and found wanting.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendliness is desirable does not mean having it as an absolute is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either tenable or healthy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Friendliness can be examined and found wanting.  This is a feature,
<br>
not a bug.  Nothing I said above is incompatible with that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So is the idea of a super-SI that rules everything else on the basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more or less hardwired and presumably immutable Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal.  Said SI will be most unfriendly to those entities that do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not agree with its notion of what friendliness entails.
</em><br>
<p>What?  Why on Earth would ve care?  Taken at face value, this statement
<br>
sounds remarkably anthropomorphic.  If you scream and hold protests about
<br>
the evil dictator SI, the evil dictator SI will help you write your
<br>
banners, organize the march, think of good slogans, and fulfill any other
<br>
Sysop API requests that don't infringe on the living space of other
<br>
citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; AFAIK it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily be &quot;friendly&quot; to those entities that simply wish to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strike out on their own outisde of its influence.
</em><br>
<p>It's the Sysop's superintelligent decision as to whether letting someone
<br>
Outside would pose an unacceptable risk to innocent sentients.  My
<br>
personal guess is that it does pose an unacceptable risk.  If something
<br>
doesn't pose an unacceptable risk to innocent sentients, you should be
<br>
able to do it through the Sysop API.  That's practically what Friendliness
<br>
*is*.  If you want to play tourist in Betelguese, wrap a chunk of Sysop
<br>
around yourself and take off.  You won't be able to torture the primitives
<br>
when you get there, but you'll be able to do anything else.
