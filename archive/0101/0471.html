Here,on page 167, in Robot: 1999,Oxford University Press
<br>
&quot;Thus an ultimate cyberspace, the physical 10^45 bits of a single human body 
<br>
could contain the efficiently coded biospheres of a thousabd galaxies-or a 
<br>
quadrillion individuals each with a quadrillion times the capacity of a human 
<br>
mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it will be so much more capacious then the conventional space it 
<br>
displaces, the expanding bubble of cyberspace can easilly recreate  
<br>
internally anything it encounters, memorizing the old universe as it consumes 
<br>
it. Traveling as fast as any warning message, it will absorb astronomical 
<br>
oddities, geologic wonders, ancient Voyager spacecraft, early Exes in 
<br>
outbound starships, and entire alien biospheres. These entities may continue 
<br>
to live and grow as if nothing happended, oblivious of their new status as 
<br>
simulations in cyberspace. They will be living memories in unimmaginably 
<br>
powerful minds, more secure in their existence, and with more future then 
<br>
ever before, because they have become the valued houseguests of transcendent 
<br>
patrons&quot;
<br>
<p>Sam: I am &quot;stoopid&quot; enough to believe this is really plausible, and I take it 
<br>
seriously; as something, that if it is not fact now fact, it will be fact 
<br>
within the deep future.  Call this my personal conviction. Whoo Hoo!

&nbsp;Are you sure that is in Moravec's book?  I don't think he explicitly
<br>
&nbsp;mentions an SI sweeping through the universe much less claim that it
<br>
&nbsp;moves at near lightspeed. He does talk about Tipler's ideas (which are
<br>
&nbsp;much more inline with the above) in passing.  But I don't think he
<br>
&nbsp;explicitly talked SI or in these terms.  But perhaps my memory is
<br>
&nbsp;faulty.  Can you point me to this?   I don't believe he talks about
<br>
&nbsp;everything being recreated in virtuality as a serious eventuality
<br>
&nbsp;although he may dabble with it in his Mind Storms chapter.
