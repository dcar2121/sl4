<p>Yeah, I don't doubt a human equivalent mind is possible with enough of
<br>
todays hardware, and crucially the right architecture. What I'm unconvinced
<br>
of is that learning will be fast enough for a hard takeoff as claimed.
<br>
<p>With nanotech however, all bets are off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem you cite, Dale, seems not a big problem.  If AI's are learning

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>My point entirely.
<br>
<p>Considering humans currently have lots of nukes pointing at each other it's
<br>
in the AI's best interests to understand these easily frightened animals
<br>
too.
<br>
<p>Do you believe your AI may loose interest in humans?
<br>
<p>If you really believe you can build a real AI, then you should really think
<br>
through the consequences.
<br>
<p>Sorry to keep throwing buckets of cold water over everyone, but if you're
<br>
worth your salt, you're really talking about the end of the human race here.
<br>
It's often treated so blasé like an episode of Star Trek in transhumanist
<br>
circles. Yes, this is the SL4 list, but that doesn't mean we take it any
<br>
less seriously.
<br>
<p>The reason I'm questioning is not because I'm being antagonistic or that I'm
<br>
particularly interested in the answers per se, but more the reasoning that's
<br>
gone on behind them. People are too eager to believe in magic.
<br>
<p>Could someone else pick up the devil's advocate line now? I'm not enjoying
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers,
<br>
Dale.
