<p><em>&gt; If, under the True Ultimate Laws of Physics and the Final Ultimate

<em>&gt; Technology, offensive technology overpowers defensive technology, then a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community of sentients killing and eating each other is definitely a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.  All the entities that started out as human will die off sooner or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later, even the transhuman AIs will be preoccupied with survival, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future will be a fairly ugly place. 
</em><br>
<p>This is a strawman and presents a false dichotomy.  Offense and defense
<br>
are only operable in an environment of continued competition where the
<br>
entities involved do not find it more productive to compete on grounds
<br>
other than physical combat with its attendant high cost for all
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, the main point is still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty horrifying even if the humans wind up barricaded behind a handful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Friendly AIs, or if the uploads are forever limited to whatever chunks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of matter they grabbed before the Cambrian explosion, or if some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman who started as a bondage fetishist grabs a handful of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunate human slaves on the way to ascension, or, for that matter, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone who stays behind on Earth gets wiped out by some rogue.  So, yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's horrifying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So is the idea of a super-SI that rules everything else on the basis of
<br>
a more or less hardwired and presumably immutable Friendliness
<br>
supergoal.  Said SI will be most unfriendly to those entities that do
<br>
not agree with its notion of what friendliness entails.  AFAIK it will
<br>
not necessarily be &quot;friendly&quot; to those entities that simply wish to
<br>
strike out on their own outisde of its influence.  There are
<br>
implications here that can look pretty scary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alternatively, you can have the entire solar system wiped out at one blow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if an unFriendly AI undergoes a hard takeoff before there are any human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploads around.  For that matter, you can have the entire solar system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wiped out if an unFriendly uploaded human undergoes a hard takeoff.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be pretty horrifying too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You can have the entire solar system wiped out if the SI decides that
<br>
maximal friendliness is to scan everyone destructively and convert the
<br>
Solar System to an SI where these troublesome beings can work out their
<br>
grievances and problems without ultimately harming themselves.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It can happen gradually - it can't *creep up*.  The community would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *notice*.  In fact, they would read the SL4 archives and anticipate all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it in advance.  As soon as the changes became noticeable, and *before*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they became critical - *pow*.
</em><br>
<p>*Pow*?  *Pow* does not sound friendly.  :-( Exactly what community is
<br>
this if the SI is the cosmic sysop and its goals go into creep mode
<br>
after it reaches that status?  There will be nothing, by your design,
<br>
that can circumvent or gainsay it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; AIs who are dreadfully panicked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about the prospect of drifting away from Friendship because Friendship is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the only important thing in the world to them...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aha!  Caught you!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now you're proposing to make AI's neurotic and mentally unhealthy... to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them fear becoming unfriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, fine, I shouldn't have used the words &quot;dreadfully panicked&quot; or &quot;only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important thing in the world&quot;.  It's sickeningly anthropomorphic and I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only doing it to convey the picture of an all-out community effort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I am *not* proposing to make AIs neurotic.  &quot;Friendliness is the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important thing in the world&quot;, or rather, &quot;Friendliness is my goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system&quot;, is a perfectly healthy state of mind for an AI.  And taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive preventative action if Friendliness is threatened doesn't require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a programmer assist; it's a natural consequence of the enormous unFriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of an AI community drifting away from Friendliness.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *never* &quot;make&quot; an AI fear anything; at most, I would ask politely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see this as a healthy state.  It is an unexamined primary
<br>
belief.  No, much stronger than that.  It is the wired in basis of
<br>
everything else.  Either it is forbidden and/or impossible to examine it
<br>
(by definition unhealthy) or it can be examined and found wanting.  That
<br>
friendliness is desirable does not mean having it as an absolute is
<br>
either tenable or healthy.
