<em>&gt; there are numbered rules for the public treatment of the singularity?
</em><br>
<p>Rule 15:   &quot;I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I
<br>
find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to
<br>
activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his
<br>
plan into operation.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>Other rules which also apply to good guys are:
<br>
<p>Rule 2:  &quot;My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rule 25:  &quot;No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any
<br>
sort of machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small
<br>
and virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rule 49:  &quot;If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can
<br>
destroy me, I will not send all my troops out to seize it. Instead I will
<br>
send them out to seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the
<br>
local paper.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rule 79:  &quot;If my doomsday device happens to come with a reverse switch, as
<br>
soon as it has been employed it will be melted down and made into
<br>
limited-edition commemorative coins.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rule 85:  &quot;I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly
<br>
complicated, e.g. 'Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then
<br>
activate the medallion at the moment of total eclipse.' Instead it will be
<br>
more along the lines of 'Push the button.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Rule 96:  &quot;My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the
<br>
control panel on the outside seals the door and blasting the control panel
<br>
on the inside opens the door, not vice versa.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>Some rules which do NOT apply to good guys:
<br>
<p>Rule 20:  &quot;Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge
<br>
in maniacal laughter.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rule 22:  &quot;No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited
<br>
power, I will not consume any energy field bigger than my head.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rule 179:  &quot;I will not outsource core functions.&quot;
<br>
<p>And of course:
<br>
<p>Rule 59:  &quot;I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>But all of us can take heart from...
<br>
<p>Rule 230:  &quot;I will not procrastinate regarding any ritual granting
<br>
immortality.&quot;
