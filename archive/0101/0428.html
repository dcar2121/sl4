<p>
anyone ever read &quot;beyond this horizon&quot; by heinlein?
<br>
<p>the prometheism.net intro page sounds a bit like the group in that book, 
<br>
that was seeking to force evolution through a state-controlled genetic 
<br>
engineering program.
<br>
<p>some examples (from the page):
<br>
<p>&quot;II.    Our aim is to create a genetically enhanced race that will 
<br>
eventually become a new, superior species. In the short-term, this will be 
<br>
achieved via eugenics and genetic engineering.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;V.   Any eugenics' program has equal validity to use the state's coercive 
<br>
power to improve human genetic capital. Genetic capital is now more valuable 
<br>
than land and/or territory aside from some scarce resources. DNA or genetic 
<br>
capital is the most valuable commodity in the universe.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I.    The danger of curing the effects of genetic disease through postnatal 
<br>
intervention, and the accumulation of bad genes, is equivalent to allowing 
<br>
toxins to build up in the environment and curing them with vitamin 
<br>
supplements. Resources must not be wasted on curing disease when it is more 
<br>
cost effective to merely eliminate the disease from the genetic capital of 
<br>
the eugenic nation. We can easily live with numerous minor genetic flaws, 
<br>
but it should never be policy to correct obviously adverse genetic diseases 
<br>
when they can be detected and eliminated from the gene pool, even though 
<br>
that is not our primary goal.&quot;
<br>
<p>(so, to hell with, say, stephen hawking, right?)
<br>
<p><p>&quot;III.   Neither any single woman nor man must be forced to procreate or to 
<br>
spend time raising children. The genes of the group flow in all of us, and 
<br>
resource acquisition is as important as having children to the success of 
<br>
the group. That is, it is each person's choice where to contribute. It may 
<br>
be more beneficial to hire breeders for having the children rather than 
<br>
force women who prefer an intellectual life over being pregnant. And the 
<br>
same with raising children. Group goals are met by everyone becoming a 
<br>
specialist in what they do best, as long as it contributes in some way.&quot;
<br>
<p>(so, going with what eli has said on his page, by this plan everyone would 
<br>
be at a net evolutionary disadvantage)
<br>
<p><p>&quot;VI.   Allegiance and patriotism to the group takes precedence before 
<br>
attachment to one's religion or patriotism to the country where one just 
<br>
happens to reside. Going to war for the state because of shared loyalties is 
<br>
dysgenic. Only patriotism to the eugenic state requires your sacrifice and 
<br>
allegiance.&quot;
<br>
<p>(that brought a chuckle...what, a eugenic military?)
<br>
<p><p>(snip most of this paragraph)
<br>
&quot;The only traits to be altered during the first genesis shall be an increase 
<br>
in overall intelligence, typical intellectual engagement(TIE), and 
<br>
patriotism
<br>
(more snip)
<br>
<p>(so, genetically controlled patriotism)
<br>
<p>and at the bottom, you will find it is part of the &quot;eugenics, genetic 
<br>
engineering, cloning and transhumanist&quot; webring
<br>
<p><p>hmm. maybe this is knee jerk, but i thought we (or maybe it was extropy) had 
<br>
shot down eugenics?
<br>
<p><p>*gabe*
