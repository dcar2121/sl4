<p>
Greetings fellow futurists...
<br>
<p>Last year I put together a very brief online book in the form of a blog, called
<br>
&quot;A Cosmist Manifesto&quot; ...
<br>
<p><a href="http://cosmistmanifesto.blogspot.com/">http://cosmistmanifesto.blogspot.com/</a>
<br>
<p>It's sorta a brief summary of my views on life, the universe and the future
<br>
of technology....  Intended for compactness and simplicity rather than intricacy
<br>
or completeness.
<br>
<p>A number of people have suggested I publish it as a regular [paper + e] book ...
<br>
so I'm considering doing this.   Really it would be more of a booklet, it's
<br>
very short!
<br>
<p>But before doing that, I'd like to go through the thing and revise it thoroughly
<br>
<p>And before doing that, I'd like to get some more comments and critiques.  What
<br>
critical ideas or aspects are missing?  What is too poorly explained?  What is
<br>
stated in a potentially misleading way?
<br>
<p>If you radically disagree with the overall perspective of the document, there's
<br>
no constructive point in saying so in the Comments: I'm very unlikely to change
<br>
my basic perspective due to your commentary!  And in a brief document of
<br>
this nature, disputation with alternative overall philosophical perspectives is
<br>
not appropriate (that's more apropos in a longer, more academic work).
<br>
But if you agree with the general direction but have constructive
<br>
criticism about
<br>
specifics, I'd love to hear it...
<br>
<p>I'd prefer to get comments in the Comments fields on the blog itself
<br>
-- that's why
<br>
I made it a blog.  Then I can go through all the Comments systematically and
<br>
revise the text accordingly.
<br>
<p>I probably won't get around to book-ifying the Cosmist Manifesto for a
<br>
month or two,
<br>
thus there is no extreme urgency here...
<br>
<p>Thanks much...
<br>
