I'm not sure if &quot;machine rebellion&quot; is a workable concept here.  If we are
<br>
talking about a civilization able to build whole subrealities at a whim, we are
<br>
already talking non-biological, uplifted sentience.  Why would they make these
<br>
(I assume lesser) guardian entities with the capacity to rebel, or even to want
<br>
to rebel?  Leave them with limited intelligence, perhaps a basic
<br>
compulsion-program to ensure that they concentrate solely on defense and
<br>
resource harvesting.
<br>
Your other point - &quot;bumping up against&quot; other civilizations - seems like a more
<br>
likely source of problems.
<br>
<p>Quoting Dagon Gmail &lt;<a href="mailto:dagonweb@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Existential%20Risk%20and%20Fermi's%20Paradox">dagonweb@gmail.com</a>&gt;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The implication would be, the galactic disk would be seeded with a steadily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing number of &quot;bombs&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. extremely defensive automated civilizations solely dedicated to keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intact the minds of its original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creators. Just one of these needs to experience a machine rebellion and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precarious balance is lost. A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine rebellion may very well not have the sentimental attachment to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; native dream-scape. Machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations could very well be staunchly objectivist, dedicated to what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regards as materialist expansion. Any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such rebellion would run into the (alleged) multitudes of &quot;dreaming&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;virtuamorph&quot; civilizations around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And we are talking big timeframes here. If the statistical analysis has any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning, virtuamorph civilizations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't be a de facto dying process; for a dreaming civilization to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other meaning than a slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abortion they have to last millions of years; millions of years means a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of galactic shuffling in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stellar trejacteories. There would be many occasions of stars with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;dreamers&quot; drifting into proximity, giving rise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paranoid, highly protectionist impulses. After all, if all that dreaming is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth anything in subjective terms the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization doing it would fight realworld battles to defend it, and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just dream about it in metaphorical terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of +5 vorpal swords.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless the mindscapes have a way of closing off access to reality, i.e. they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materially escape this universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But then we introduce new unknows and arbitrary explanations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it's simply easier for civilizations to maintain their consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in worlds of their own creation rather than expend energy and time in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one which is outside of their complete control.  It would seem to me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being able to create a paradise of information and experience from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; substrate of this world would be a better existence than existing in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world as is.  Once to this stage, maybe to other civilizations simply do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to be bothered by lesser beings in this reality who might upset the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; balance and control they desire.  One would only need to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the prime number sequence in order to create an infinite order of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability densities with the next higher prime as the next iterative seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; value.  In this way, one could mimic true randomness.  A civilization could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at both times experience truly unique experiences yet have complete control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over their reality.  The reality they experience would ultimately be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by the available energy in this reality but hypothetically, they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manipulate time in such a way that one second here would be a million years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in their experienced reality.  Ultimately, their fate would be dependent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; upon the goings on in this universe, but they could develop machines to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gather energy and other resources to maintain their minds in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sub-realities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; They would need to build machines incapable of communicating or avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communicating with minds in this reality while they experience a completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unique reality of their own choosing through technology. The machines in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this time and space are drones programmed to protect the mind(s) living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; within the created world(s).  You could go so far as to model this entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; existence where each individual mind shapes vis own reality which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; protected by drones in the higher reality with the ability to transfer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mind between realities as one sees fit or keep others out as one sees fit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Universes could be born by the integration and random sharing of minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thereby generating more unique child realities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The ultimate liberty would be to give each person vis own ideaspace with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which to construct their own reality and experience it as they see fit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It would be really cool to be to the level of existence as a universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mind integrating with other universal minds creating completely new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why would you want to exchange this kind of ability for the lesser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; existence of an entropic reality?
</em><br>
