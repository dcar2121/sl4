Hi Adam,
<br>
<p>This isn't a settled conversation by any stretch of the imagination, 
<br>
though we are speaking strickly about the evolution of the human brain 
<br>
and it's related intelligence. The greater consensus is that human 
<br>
evolution around brain size and function is realitvely slow;
<br>
<p>University of Chicago geneticist, Chug-I Wu has been comparing the rate 
<br>
of genetic evolution in the brain among to a wide variety of other 
<br>
primates (Chimpanzees and Old World Monkees.) When spcifically compared 
<br>
with Chimapanzees, human evolution among genes related to structure of 
<br>
the brain are changing at a substantially slower rate for homo sapiens. 
<br>
When asked &quot;Does this mean that Chimpanzees are catching up with us?&quot; He 
<br>
answered;
<br>
<p>/*&quot;The Human brain's astounding comlexity may be at the root of the 
<br>
decelerating genetic changes.&quot; He adds: &quot;Because genes in the brain code 
<br>
for proteins that interact with many other molecules, the wiggle room 
<br>
for evolutionary tinkering is limited. Change a gene to much and it wil 
<br>
be unable to continue its existing functions. The higher rate of 
<br>
evolution in chimps, probably just reflects the fact that each gene in 
<br>
that species has fewer other genes interacting with it than in humans. 
<br>
Since the complexity of the interactive network of genes likely 
<br>
determines intelligence, the answer is probably just the opposite.&quot;*/
<br>
<p>On the flip side, a research in Utah co-authored an article suggesing 
<br>
that at least the brain-case of human beings is changing at a fairly 
<br>
radical rate;
<br>
<p>Gregory Cochran of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah, a 
<br>
coauthor of the study, said the research may force a radical rethinking 
<br>
of the story of modern human evolution. He is quoted saying “It turns 
<br>
current thinking upside-down, pretty much,”
<br>
<p>/*His oberservation into structural changes in the human cranium suggest 
<br>
that the rate of human evolution is still quite high. The human brain 
<br>
case has shrunk significantly over the past 20,000 to 30,000 years. Of 
<br>
course in that same timframe the human forehead has risen sharpy, and 
<br>
suggests that the trade-off in certain kinds of brain function in 
<br>
preference of others (like expanded prfrontal cortex activity) may be an 
<br>
indication that these changes are part of higher brain functionality of 
<br>
our species. There is also the likelihood of higher densities in brain 
<br>
tissue, and structural rearrangement allow for a rather more complex 
<br>
brain to fit into a smaller braincase.*/
<br>
<p>To add a grain of salt to the last reference, the study by Cochran and 
<br>
his Associate, is generating a bit of controversy, and there seems to be 
<br>
a significant number of experts in the field who find question with the 
<br>
conclusions.
<br>
<p>The question of making and sustaining a brain of this size is very complex;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Passing such a big brain through such a small birth canal (~ 10 cm.),
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The dangers of mechanical stress (the larger the brain the larger
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the larger the risk for injury due to sudden jerking or rotation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the skull... you've heard of a &quot;Knock Out&quot; or &quot;Shaken Baby
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syndrome?&quot;,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The growing probability of wiring/neurotransmitter operational
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errors, and their related pathologies
<br>
<p>A really big brain comes with an extraodinarily high metabolic and 
<br>
environmental cost. Think about it, if genius had survival value, we'd 
<br>
be a race of geniuses. The fact that the only people having this 
<br>
conversation are 2 to 4 sigma out, suggests that the normal daily 
<br>
process of life does not sellect for brilliance, and that the subsequent 
<br>
baggage of such &quot;Great Thinking&quot; may be high indeed.

<em>&gt; Thank you for this fascinating conversation. I think our discussions

<em>&gt; Mary, I would be very interested in reading more about the evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting that human evolution has slowed and potential reasons for this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A book by Nick Lane, Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Life, may be relevant to this discussion of evolution. From both a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design and an empirical/historical perspective, Lane argues that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though simple cellular life should exist fairly commonly throughout 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe, there is a low probability for the evolution of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eukaryotic cells. And without this symbiotic evolution producing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mitochondria containing cells, life would not be capable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (energetically) of supporting the complexity of multicellular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms (thus putting evolved sentience out of the question). This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis, combined with our observed timeline of evolution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolution">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolution</a>) suggests that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex-biological-intelligence may not be a major limiting factor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when compared with other obstacles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, I would appreciate any thoughts on the following idea:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it possible that the astronomical observation of inter-galactic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voids (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_%28astronomy%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_%28astronomy%29</a>) could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explained by Dyson Spheres or some similar technology capable of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absorbing most of the radiation of a star? If an AI were expanding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outwards from its origins in an exponential fashion, and if complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence was such a rare phenomenon that it occurred once every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several hundred (or thousand) galaxies, perhaps the universe would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look much like the one observe today: relatively dense filaments of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; galaxies surrounding vast regions of &quot;empty space&quot; Or perhaps the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe looks this way for entirely different reasons. And of course, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Eliezer pointed out, this would say nothing about whether these AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were benevolent to their progenitors.
