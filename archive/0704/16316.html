since we're in redux/recurse mode: <a href="http://dieselsweeties.com/archive.php?s=1700">http://dieselsweeties.com/archive.php?s=1700</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *snips libertarian whinging*
</em><br>
elephant in the room: if you can't handle a single nested OT/non-SL4
<br>
anecdote within an otherwise on-topic commentary and then just move
<br>
on, then stuff the room, there's an elephant in your arse. way to take
<br>
one off-topic example statement and then ignore the entire thrust of
<br>
the rest of the argument. the post itself was clearly a casually
<br>
phrased thought experiment trying to evaluate emotional/human issues
<br>
and how they may pollute our development of an ai progeny. after
<br>
anecdoting the usual mars/venus suspect required to note entry into
<br>
non-rational territory - i.e to start speaking human, because that's
<br>
what we -are-, and that infects our work, even as we try to be
<br>
super-rational, hence -bias-. Using childcare/education as an example
<br>
is simply trying to invoke another 'universal' aspect of humanity
<br>
without being overly perverse - a failing I am prone to. Calling me
<br>
out as 'democrat' is -you- politicising and introducing america-bias -
<br>
to someone who has never even visited stateside and has only ever
<br>
voted the once, many years ago, and for a Jack Russell at that
<br>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGillicuddy_Serious_Party">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGillicuddy_Serious_Party</a>). FWIW I
<br>
think all libertarians should have their child/love-one shot and
<br>
wounded at least once; all anarchists should be mugged and beaten by
<br>
someone bigger than them; liberals should have homeless people move in
<br>
to their house; and conservatives should lose their jobs.
<br>
<p>The modern political landscape will presumably go under just as much
<br>
change as anything else as we trend through the singularity. Avoiding
<br>
the rant-wars present elsewhere is a fine motive, but to be honest I
<br>
think part of embracing SL4 as-it-affects culture should be debating
<br>
what future directions societal management is going to take. i.e.
<br>
&quot;Direct Democracy&quot; will probably never work, as no-one will ever vote
<br>
to raise taxes.
