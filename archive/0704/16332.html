<p>
sl4 discussants,
<br>
<p>Thank you for this fascinating conversation.  I think our discussions  
<br>
could be even better if there were more citing of research/background- 
<br>
materials supporting claims.  If you have particularly informative  
<br>
sources, please share them!
<br>
<p>Mary, I would be very interested in reading more about the evidence  
<br>
suggesting that human evolution has slowed and potential reasons for  
<br>
this.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, I would like to learn more about the 10^8 figure for a  
<br>
complexity limit to evolution.  Can this be found in the George  
<br>
Williams book or did you calculate this number?
<br>
<p>A book by Nick Lane, Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the  
<br>
Meaning of Life,  may be relevant to this discussion of evolution.   
<br>
&nbsp;From both a design and an empirical/historical perspective, Lane  
<br>
argues that though simple cellular life should exist fairly commonly  
<br>
throughout the universe, there is a low probability for the evolution  
<br>
of eukaryotic cells.  And without this symbiotic evolution producing  
<br>
mitochondria containing cells, life would not be capable  
<br>
(energetically) of supporting the complexity of multicellular  
<br>
organisms (thus putting evolved sentience out of the question).  This  
<br>
hypothesis, combined with our observed timeline of evolution (http:// 
<br>
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolution) suggests that complex- 
<br>
biological-intelligence may not be a major limiting factor when  
<br>
compared with other obstacles.
<br>
<p>Also, I would appreciate any thoughts on the following idea:
<br>
Is it possible that the astronomical observation of inter-galactic  
<br>
voids (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_%28astronomy%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_%28astronomy%29</a>) could be  
<br>
explained by Dyson Spheres or some similar technology capable of  
<br>
absorbing most of the radiation of a star?  If an AI were expanding  
<br>
outwards from its origins in an exponential fashion, and if complex  
<br>
intelligence was such a rare phenomenon that it occurred once every  
<br>
several hundred (or thousand) galaxies, perhaps the universe would  
<br>
look much like the one observe today:  relatively dense filaments of  
<br>
galaxies surrounding vast regions of &quot;empty space&quot;  Or perhaps the  
<br>
universe looks this way for entirely different reasons.  And of  
<br>
course, as Eliezer pointed out, this would say nothing about whether  
<br>
these AI were benevolent to their progenitors.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Adam

<em>&gt;&gt; Evolution has a complexity limit, the amount of genetic  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; information that it can support against degenerative mutation,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; given a copying fidelity and a maximum selection pressure.  This

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reached long ago.  Thus, the random walk has an upper limit and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; does not expand.  Since then we have simply been substituting new  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; complexity for old complexity as adaptive challenges change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Much of this discussion on this thread shows misunderstanding of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; basic evolutionary biology combined with no realization that more  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; advanced understandings exist.  I recommend &quot;Adaptation and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Natural Selection&quot; by George Williams for starters (this is the
