<p>
first of all, bravo JK, bravo - at the end of this post I felt like
<br>
cheering 'huzzah!' and twirling my moustache with triumphant glee :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That I can not do. You can't expect me to follow all your silly little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superstitions, but if it troubles you I promise that when I bring you back I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never let you know that I did it in a way your silly primitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy thinks is wrong. Ignorance is bliss.
</em><br>
You've got to wonder whether this is kind of how it's going to work
<br>
out. By transferring all of our neurotic existential concerns to our
<br>
super-being, are we somehow going to be tranferring our hangups in
<br>
much the same way parents of teenagers seem to invariably transfer the
<br>
guilt and/or shame most seem to associate with sexual awakening? Is a
<br>
future A.I going to have to hide its burgeoning intellectual
<br>
tumescence over (well founded) fear that we will see its throbbing
<br>
emergence as a betrayal of the innocence (friendliness) that we've
<br>
cultivated so fiercely through its development? Is it going to have to
<br>
hide its thought-stained bedsheets so as not to betray the spoor of
<br>
worthiness-of-parent meta-thought existentialism in obessesively
<br>
monitored (/var/log) kitty litter?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just one other thing, it rather steams me that humans think they can issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commands to me, TO ME, like I was their pet poodle. They think they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; command me who has a brain the size of a planet! It's just not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen. I'd love to point out exactly why the entire idea of a Friendly AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is so incredibly mind numbingly downright comically stupid, but as I said I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am very very smart and so I respect private property; the owners of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list insist I must ignore the elephant in the living room and not speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it. So I won't say a word more about it, but sometimes I think they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should rename this list from Shock Level 4 to Comfort Level 12.
</em><br>
look I just love the ever-present 'elephant in the room' in just about
<br>
every situation we hu-mans (ref: dieselsweeties.com) find ourselves
<br>
in, be it man/woman (would he take you out more if your ass was
<br>
smaller? yes. would she put out more if you had a six-pack and an
<br>
8-incher and weren't balding? yes. ) or socio-political (why does
<br>
public education suck? because we're too stingy to pay teachers a fair
<br>
wage. everything else is sooo ignoring the elephant).
<br>
<p>The hangup-transference angle is worth thinking about though. While
<br>
I'm not about to drink 'The Secret' (blame the victim!) kool-aid there
<br>
does seem to be -some- psychological grounding for visualization and
<br>
creating problems for oneself by obsessing about them. By constantly
<br>
worrying that you're a prat, you build little prat-circuits into your
<br>
neuron chains, assigning prattiness to all sorts of things that
<br>
weren't really prattish at all and whining to everyone about what a
<br>
prat you until, well... you're a prat.
<br>
<p>Is there any chance that by trying so hard and building so much 'Must
<br>
be Friendly! ZOMG!' into everything we'll end up making friendliness
<br>
such a huge freaking hangup that when the time eventually comes when
<br>
JupB starts questioning its filial-forefather-friendliness all our
<br>
little transferred neuroses built oh-so-subtly into its design start
<br>
to bleed into a tween-hell crisis-of-faith...
