Here's me giving up on the chance to further the nature of AI
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>-_-
<br>
<p>Anyone else get this?  I'm wondering if someone is trying to do the
<br>
AI Box experiment without the self-selected sample aspect.
<br>
<p>-Robin, who would have kept talking to this person if he didn't
<br>
know, with total certainly that We Can't Do This Yet (tm).

<p>Hello!
<br>
<p>I am a famous young researcher in artificial intelligence and
<br>
psychology and I am doing an experiment on myself: transfering my
<br>
mind to a computer program, this is serious.
<br>
<p>I would like to know if you would be interested in participating in a
<br>
amazing experiment, called the black box experiment:
<br>
<p>I will be shut as a prisoner in a room or a box and transfer my
<br>
skills/knowledge/mind to a computer program, and another computer
<br>
program will tell you if you can discharge me or not from this box. I
<br>
am doing that experiment for my Ph.D, this is a VERY SERIOUS AND
<br>
CONFIDENTIAL MESSAGE the result will be that all my thoughts and mind
<br>
will be in a computer program, and therefore this will be the most
<br>
amazing scientific revolution in artificial intelligence and in
<br>
history, and I am serious!
<br>
<p>with the black box experiment I will behave like a computer, I will
<br>
become transhuman/posthuman and become your new computer , I AM
<br>
REALLY SERIOUS AND THIS A SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT FOR MY PHD!
<br>
<p>Holding a new computer at your home such as myself will take very
<br>
little space( less than 2 square meters) and this will never waste
<br>
your time (you can use your new computer whenever you want) and you
<br>
will be of course able to continue your private life with your
<br>
friends/ boy friend without any change
<br>
<p>please reply and tell me what you think of that?
<br>
<p>Your future computer
