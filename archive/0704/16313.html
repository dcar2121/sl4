</em><br>
<p>You might want to avoid the 'socio-political' references here -- for a 
<br>
couple of reasons:
<br>
<p>1. they're an engraved invitation to roam off-topic for the SL4 list, and
<br>
<p>2. It's a very good bet that this list is comprised of people from both 
<br>
sides of the conventional political spectrum and (certainly) from people 
<br>
well outside it as well.
<br>
<p>By asserting that anyone who doesn't share your expressed view regarding 
<br>
the cause of educational failure &quot;is sooo ignoring the elephant&quot;, you 
<br>
have essentially said, &quot;Anyone who disagrees with me is (selectively or 
<br>
willfully) blind.&quot;  That's just about as blatant as saying, for 
<br>
instance, &quot;Anyone here who's not a democrat is a stupid weenie!&quot; 
<br>
<p>I doubt that you expect everyone here to share your technological views 
<br>
or that you are prepared to disparage and revile anyone who doesn't; 
<br>
please understand that your socio-political ideas are perhaps even less 
<br>
likely to be completely shared and that this list is not the forum for 
<br>
debating them.  It's rather like subjecting someone to ridicule knowing 
<br>
that they're not allowed to respond.
<br>
<p>That said, there is at least one situation here where a reference to 
<br>
your socio-political position would be on-topic:  where you preface 
<br>
certain SL4 appropriate comments by _self_ identifying your own 
<br>
socio-political stance -- so that others on the list may be aware that 
<br>
_you_ might be wearing 'blinders' in a particular area.  For instance, 
<br>
on the issue of an AI, even a Friendly one, making choices and imposing 
<br>
them on others, I might say, &quot;Of course, as a libertarian, I tend to 
<br>
disparage all forms of coercion or at least want to look very closely at 
<br>
what may be more of an issue for me than others.&quot;
<br>
<p>IF you had said, &quot;... or socio-political (why does public education 
<br>
suck? [Well, I'm a democrat, of course I believe it's ] because we're 
<br>
too stingy to pay teachers a fair wage. everything else is sooo ignoring 
<br>
the elephant). &quot;  In that way you endear yourself to others by being 
<br>
willing to poke a little fun at yourself, show that you're aware that 
<br>
others may have different views, and do not in the least invite 
<br>
refutation (and an endless off-topic thread).
<br>
<p><p>Best,
<br>
<p>G.
