<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>It's my pleasure to announce a conference that I'm helping to co-organize...
<br>
<p>** The First Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, aka AGI-08 **
<br>
<p>Information may be found at the website
<br>
<p><a href="http://agi-08.org/">http://agi-08.org/</a>
<br>
<p>It will be in early March 2008 at the University of Memphis, and we have
<br>
every hope it will be an historic occasion, playing a major role in
<br>
crystallizing
<br>
AGI as a coherent and critical field of research.
<br>
<p>While it will be in the main a technical research conference, non-academics
<br>
are welcome -- anyone is welcome who is interested to learn about what
<br>
is currently happening in the field of AGI.
<br>
<p>This is going to be a somewhat larger and more formally organized conference
<br>
than the small AGI Workshop I helped organize in Bethesda in May 2006.
<br>
<p>The conference chair is Stan Franklin, author of &quot;Artificial Minds&quot; and one
<br>
of the
<br>
recognized leaders of the AGI field (famous among other things for his
<br>
introduction
<br>
of the &quot;agents perspective&quot; into the modern vocabulary of AI).  Pei Wang,
<br>
Bruce Klein and I are among the co-chairs.
<br>
<p>Research papers are solicited for presentation, the deadline is September
<br>
30.
<br>
<p>Proceedings will be published by IOS Press.
<br>
<p>On the conference web page you will find, among other things, a one-page
<br>
color brochure for the conference.  If you are affiliated with a university
<br>
or some other institution likely to be home to folks potentially interested
<br>
in
<br>
AGI-08, I'd like to encourage you to print up this brochure and post it
<br>
publicly.
<br>
<p>Also, you may feel free to forward this email to any relevant email lists
<br>
you may
<br>
come across.  Or to academic email lists you may wish to forward the formal
<br>
&quot;Call for Papers&quot; which I append at the end of this email and also in a text
<br>
file
<br>
&nbsp;attachment.  The CFP is also given on the conference website at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.agi-08.org/overview_callforpapers.php">http://www.agi-08.org/overview_callforpapers.php</a>
<br>
<p>I hope to see many members of this email list at the conference in March!!
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Ben Goertzel

<br>
<p>First Call for Papers
<br>
The First Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI-08)
<br>
March 1-3, 2008, at Memphis, Tennessee, USA
<br>
<a href="http://www.agi-08.org">http://www.agi-08.org</a>
<br>
Paper submission deadline: September 30, 2007
<br>
---------------------------
<br>
<p>The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) was initially directly aimed
<br>
at the construction of &quot;thinking machines&quot; – that is, computer systems
<br>
with human-like general intelligence. But this task proved very
<br>
difficult, and so as steps in this direction, AI researchers focused
<br>
on producing AI systems displaying intelligence regarding specific
<br>
tasks in relatively narrow domains. In recent years, however, the
<br>
situation has been changing. More and more researchers have recognized
<br>
the necessity – and feasibility – of returning to the original goals
<br>
of the field. Increasingly, there is a call for a transition from the
<br>
current focus on highly specialized &quot;narrow AI&quot; problem solving
<br>
systems, back to confronting the more difficult issues of &quot;human level
<br>
intelligence&quot; and more broadly &quot;artificial general intelligence
<br>
(AGI).&quot;
<br>
<p>Encouraged by the recent success of several smaller-scale AGI-Related
<br>
Meetings (www.agi-08.org/related.php) we have taken the initiative to
<br>
facilitate the very first international conference on AGI. The AGI-08
<br>
conference will give AGI researchers the opportunity for presenting
<br>
research results and exchanging ideas on topics of common interest.
<br>
During the conference, we will also discuss the possibility of
<br>
creating a new organization to promote and coordinate AGI research.
<br>
<p>The conference is explicitly open to all the various techniques used
<br>
in seeking to realize general intelligence – for instance, symbolic,
<br>
connectionist, evolutionary, robotic, mathematical, or integrative
<br>
approaches (... or new approaches that the conference organizers have
<br>
never heard of!). We are particularly interested in papers describing
<br>
concrete, reasonably well-fleshed-out AGI projects – meaning, research
<br>
projects that:
<br>
<p>- are based on a coherent theory about &quot;intelligence&quot; as a whole
<br>
- involve a concrete engineering plan oriented toward implementing the
<br>
relevant conception of general intelligence in a computer system
<br>
- have already produced some concrete results, either practical or theoretical
<br>
<p>However, we are also open to high-quality submissions that address key
<br>
aspects of AGI from a purely theoretical perspective, or that discuss
<br>
AGI projects at an earlier stage of development. There is a list of
<br>
Suggested Topics (www.agi-08.org/suggested.php) at the conference
<br>
website, though other topics are also welcomed, so long as there is a
<br>
recognizable relation to AGI, as defined above.
<br>
<p>AGI-08 will be an inter-disciplinary meeting. Besides computer
<br>
scientists and engineers, we also welcome researchers from cognitive
<br>
science, psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and other
<br>
allied fields.
<br>
<p>Conference Format
<br>
---------------------------
<br>
A tentative schedule (www.agi-08.org/schedule.php) is available at the
<br>
conference website.
<br>
<p>Briefly speaking, the conference will consist of several technical
<br>
sessions, a poster session, and a few special sessions as well. Each
<br>
technical session will be organized around a topic, and have time for
<br>
talks, panel discussion, and general discussion.
<br>
<p>Paper Submission
<br>
---------------------------
<br>
AGI-08 will accept two types of submissions: full-length papers (12
<br>
pages) and short position statements (5 pages). All submissions should
<br>
be prepared using the IOS templates
<br>
(www.iospress.nl/authco/instruction_crc.html), either in LaTeX or in
<br>
MS Word.
<br>
<p>All the papers will be submitted electronically. The details of the
<br>
submission procedure will be announced before the due date at the
<br>
conference website.
<br>
<p>AGI-08 Proceedings will be published by IOS Press, a major AI
<br>
publisher. All accepted papers will also be available on-line for open
<br>
access.
<br>
<p>Whether an accepted paper (of either length) will be presented as a
<br>
talk or as a poster will be determined by the Program Committee, in
<br>
part based on paper quality as assessed by the anonymous reviewers,
<br>
and in part according to the extent the paper addresses a topic of
<br>
core interest to the AGI community.
<br>
<p>The acceptance of a paper is based on the assumption that one of the
<br>
authors will attend the conference to present the paper.
<br>
<p>Important Due Dates
<br>

<br>
- September 30, 2007: Paper submission
<br>
- November 30, 2007: Acceptance notification
