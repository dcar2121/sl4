<em>&gt; A build-your-own PhD may result in an advisor who doesn't understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or care about your dissertation, and thus has no way of deciding when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are &quot;done&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Find a professor who has a grant, and a problem for you to work on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Work on it and graduate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Better yet, get an MS, get a job, be given a real problem to work on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and use it for your dissertation.
</em><br>
<p>Phil, I feel your advice is overly cynical!!!
<br>
<p>For instance, Moshe Looks (who works with me on Novamente), is just
<br>
now wrapping up his PhD at Washington University (in CS).   What he
<br>
did was:
<br>
<p>-- fund his PhD via working on a professor's research grant, i.e.
<br>
working in their lab part of each week on some narrow-AI research
<br>
<p>-- do a PhD thesis on a topic of his own choice, closely tied to the
<br>
Novamente AGI system but also with more academically acceptable
<br>
narrow-AI aspects (see www. metacog.org)
<br>
<p>In terms of coursework, he took mostly CS courses as expected but also
<br>
got permission to do some cog sci courses in the psychology
<br>
department.
<br>
<p>His adviser is not extremely expert in his thesis area but is a
<br>
lateral thinker, and was happy to supervise his thesis anyway.  His
<br>
thesis committee includes a number of outsiders including myself and a
<br>
couple folks from universities other than Wash. U.
<br>
<p>The point is, there actually is some flexibility in the graduate
<br>
education system, if you find the right people and convince them you
<br>
are capable of independent work and learning.
<br>
<p>I am not in love with contemporary academia by any means, but Phil,
<br>
you seem to be overstating the case against it ;-)
<br>
