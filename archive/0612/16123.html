<p>I disagree. By the way, there's two distinct things: algorithmic 
<br>
complexity and theory of computational complexity. In my opinion, at least 
<br>
basic knowledge of the latter is quite important for AGI. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It is quite useful to understand the difference between class of problems 
<br>
that are in P and those that are in NP. The difference between class of 
<br>
problems that are in NP and those that are NP hard. The reasons we don't 
<br>
know whether P=NP and how that affects our judgements about the 
<br>
possibility of efficiently solving certain kinds of problems. 
<br>
<p>Theory of computational complexity has almost nothing to do with whether 
<br>
an algorithm has a complexity of O(n) or O(nlogn). That's the area for 
<br>
algorithmic complexity. It may tell you that you cannot make an algorithm 
<br>
that is faster than certain complexity - with certain assumptions. It can 
<br>
also tell you whether one can create an efficient approximative solver, or 
<br>
efficient distributed algorithms for a certain class of problems.
<br>
<p>It can also tell you, and give you an intuition, of what happens when you 
<br>
change a problems - just a little bit. Sometimes small changes can have 
<br>
huge effects on computational complexity of problems - and you wouldn't 
<br>
want to work with an architecture that e.g. made verifying wanted 
<br>
properties of self-modification cryptographically hard. [You might be 
<br>
willing to accept NP hardness, though, if the category of problems was 
<br>
such that you could limit yourself to those instances of the problem space 
<br>
that _are_ easy to solve].
