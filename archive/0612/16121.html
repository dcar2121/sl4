<em>&gt; My question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Following Ben's comment about his colleague who did his PhD while working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Novamente, can anyone formulate a specific question related to FAI that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could plausibly be answered by a PhD thesis? In other words, what do people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think are the well-defined problems (I am specifically interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions relating to the above topics, but feel that precise questions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally Good Things)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Dan Burfoot
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you could make recent Shane Legg's attempted proof of the
<br>
impossibility of Friendly AI work, that would be an interesting part
<br>
of a PhD thesis ;-)
<br>
<p>In the rest of this email I will suggest some potential PhD thesis
<br>
topics that are relevant to AGI, though not addressing Friendliness in
<br>
particular.
<br>
<p>If you are interested in neural nets (as I infer from your list of
<br>
interests given in your email), one fascinating area to study is the
<br>
manner in which (approximate)probabilistic inference may emerge from
<br>
neural networks (based on &quot;Hebbian learning&quot; of various sorts, e.g.
<br>
spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation).  There is an emerging
<br>
literature on neural probabilistic inference, but the work being done
<br>
is quite primitive, and I have some concrete ideas on how to extend
<br>
it, but have not followed up on them due to other priorities.
<br>
<p>Next, there are many ways to follow up on Moshe Looks' recent PhD
<br>
thesis work, see www.metacog.org .   He, in collaboration with me, has
<br>
created a probabilistic evolutionary program learning system called
<br>
MOSES, useful as a narrow-AI (e.g. we've used it for bioinformatic
<br>
data analysis) but mainly intended for use within an integrated AGI
<br>
system.  MOSES is very nice as-is, but at the moment we have only used
<br>
it in a fairly crude way, as a &quot;machine learning&quot; type system that
<br>
approaches each problem as a fresh challenge.  What needs to be done
<br>
for using MOSES in an AGI context, is to have MOSES start out its
<br>
analysis of a problem via transferring knowledge that it gained
<br>
analysing other, related problems.  This could be a very nice PhD
<br>
topic, MOSES+transfer learning.  It has both narrow-AI and AGI
<br>
applicability.
<br>
<p>In the cognitive robotics domain, a key research area would be &quot;symbol
<br>
grounding.&quot;  Deb Roy has done some nice work with grounding of simple
<br>
terms like nouns, verbs and adjectives.  But this stuff is
<br>
conceptually very simple, and is a challenge mainly in terms of
<br>
systems integration.  What is subtler and more fascinating from an AGI
<br>
perspective is grounding of **prepositions** based on embodied
<br>
experience. This requires much greater contextual understanding.  It
<br>
may be done using actual robots as Deb Roy has done, or using
<br>
simulated robots (as we are playing with in the AGISim simulation
<br>
world environment), or both (using a simulation world to perfect one's
<br>
ideas and code, then transferring it to a physical robot, perhaps by
<br>
using a standard API like Pyro to control both one's real robot and
<br>
one's simulated robot).
<br>
<p>If any of these problems interests you, we could discuss more details off-list.
