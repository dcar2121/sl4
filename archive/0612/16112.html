Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Great question.  Becoming a computer science major is probably the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst thing you can do.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a major overstatement.  Of course, I myself avoided
<br>
being a CS major and majored in math, but it is highly possible to be
<br>
a CS major and get a strong grounding in AGI.  You just have to
<br>
realize that this grounding won't come automatically as a consequence
<br>
of studying CS, or of studying narrow-AI as presented in most
<br>
universities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Taking math is good, but avoid set theory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract algebra, and take a lot of statistics and probability.
</em><br>
<p>And, I found that in getting my PhD in math, nearly all I learned was
<br>
irrelevant to AGI.  I did avoid set theory and abstract algebra, and
<br>
mostly studied advanced analysis --- real, complex, functional,....
<br>
Fascinating stuff but not AGI-relevant in any direct way.  Useful here
<br>
and there in narrow Ai for stuff like vision processing and SVM's.
<br>
<p>My point is, no discipline -- CS, math, psych, neuro, etc. -- will
<br>
really teach you what you need to know to fully grok current thinking
<br>
on AGI.
<br>
<p>What discipline you're centered in matters much less than whether
<br>
you're oriented toward gathering interdisciplinary knowledge that is
<br>
broad, deep, and appropriately focused.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Things in a computer science program not relevant to AI:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Learning how to program in twelve different computer languages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Compiler theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Operating systems theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computer architecture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Complexity theory, other than knowing the diff between O(nlogn) and O(n*n)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    (here I'm using &quot;complexity theory&quot; to refer to i.e. understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    between recursive, recursively enumerable, and co-recursively-enumerable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    not to &quot;complexity studies&quot; a la the Santa Fe Institute)
</em><br>
<p>Obviously, this kind of list is highly opinionated and individual...
<br>
<p>As I think logic is more relevant to AGI than Phil does, I also think
<br>
some species of computational complexity theory are useful to know for
<br>
thinking about AGI.
<br>
<p>For instance, I think the theory of Descriptive Complexity is
<br>
incredibly fascinating and might one day be part of an AGI theory.
<br>
Everyone should understand Fagin's Theorem ;-) ... the relationship
<br>
between logical frameworks and computational complexity classes is too
<br>
deep to ignore....  True, it's all about &quot;worst case complexity&quot; and
<br>
hence not directly applicable to AGI -- but I'll bet my uncle's left
<br>
elbow that eventually someone will generalize descriptive complexity
<br>
theory to average case complexity, and that the result WILL be useful
<br>
for AGI theory, telling you what kind of logical operations an AGI
<br>
needs to be able to carry out (explicitly or implicitly) in order to
<br>
solve what kinds of problems with reasonable efficiency...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Things that people at universities generally teach you about AI, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think are very useful for AGI:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Game-tree search
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How to write a unification algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natural-language processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonsense reasoning, naive physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophy of AI
</em><br>
<p>Again, this are very highly opinionated choices....
<br>
<p>For example:
<br>
Game-tree search is not directly useful for AGI, but illustrates the
<br>
general principles of forward and backward chaining inference, which
<br>
arguably have general system-theoretic and cognitive importance, see
<br>
<p>www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2006/ForwardBackward.htm
<br>
<p>for some thoughts on this.
<br>
<p>NLP covers a lot of areas, but my view is that statistical NLP has
<br>
taught us a lot about the nature of language, which is relevant to
<br>
understanding human intelligence and linguistic behavior and therefore
<br>
relevant to AGI.  Even though, yeah, today's pragmatic NLP algorithms
<br>
are not the way a mind would process language...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Possibly useful, but overemphasized:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lots of traditional symbolic-logic-based representation and deduction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Expert systems
</em><br>
<p>Now I would say &quot;Expert systems&quot; are totally irrelevant to AGI ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More useful:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agent architectures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology, esp. studies of perception, attention, learning, and memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroanatomy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional neuroscience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability theory, Bayes nets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural networks, optimization, genetic algorithm &amp; programming
</em><br>
<p>I agree with the above
<br>
<p><em>&gt; signal processing: Fourier transform, wavelets, Kalman filters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data analysis: PCA, ICA, factor analysis, discriminant analysis,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logistic regression, SVMs
</em><br>
<p>I pretty much disagree with the above.  It's worthwhile stuff but not
<br>
terribly relevant to AGI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; dynamical systems theory, artificial life, catastrophy theory or chaos theory
</em><br>
<p>Strongly agree...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember that the purpose of getting a PhD isn't to learn - it's to get a PhD.
</em><br>
<p>Well, fortunately, the two goals are not really mutually exclusive...
<br>
<p>More to the point would be: A PhD program doesn't exist to teach you
<br>
what YOU want to learn, it exists to teach you what the DEPARTMENT
<br>
you're studying in wants you to learn.
<br>
<p>I learned a hell of a lot of mathematics while studying for my PhD.
<br>
It happened that even at the time I was more interested in other
<br>
things, and spent more time studying weird stuff on the side as
<br>
studying the math I was supposed to be studying...
<br>
<p>Some universities offer interdisciplinary build-your-own PhD programs,
<br>
BTW.  I know University of Chicago used to, back in the day...
<br>
