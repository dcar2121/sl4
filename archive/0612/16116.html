<em>&gt; &gt; Some universities offer interdisciplinary build-your-own PhD programs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any decent professor should let you build your own PhD, as long as it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly associated with the adviser's field.
</em><br>
<p>This is partially true... a couple caveats though:
<br>
<p>1) Funding for PhD study is often tied to professors' research grants,
<br>
which are often tied to particular areas of study.  So, if you don't
<br>
need funding or if you can get funding through a &quot;teaching
<br>
assistantship&quot; (common in math, less so in CS for example), then your
<br>
odds of doing a thesis in an area you are interested in are
<br>
considerably greater.
<br>
<p>2) The flexibility provided by a good adviser, in the US system, is
<br>
limited.  It mostly applies after the MS level.  E.g. to get a PhD in
<br>
math you first need an MS in math, which where I got mine involved
<br>
taking fairly tough year-end written comprehensive exams in abstract
<br>
algebra, real analysis and complex analysis.  Not much flexibility
<br>
there.  OTOH after the MS level I was allowed to pick and choose my
<br>
subject areas more flexibly, including (if I filled out forms and got
<br>
permissions) taking some classes in allied disciplines like CS and
<br>
physics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, even university professors (the good ones) have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love of creativity and exploration!
</em><br>
<p>Certainly....  When I was a professor (for 8 year) I found that around
<br>
~15% of the other profs had a healthy spirit of creativity and
<br>
exploration.  This may seem low, but OTOH, I found the percentage of
<br>
undergraduate students possessing such a spirit was much lower.  I was
<br>
far fonder of graduate students, perhaps 1/3 of whom combined
<br>
intelligence with true interest in and excitement for their subject
<br>
area.  I think that grad school, in the right place (which has as much
<br>
to do with the community of grad students as with the curriculum), can
<br>
be a really nice opportunity to focus on creative research and
<br>
learning.  Fun and stimulating, though not necessarily good
<br>
preparation for the &quot;real world&quot; ;-pp
