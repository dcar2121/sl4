I tried sending this message to the list about two weeks ago, but it  
<br>
simply never made it across the Internet.  I tried again and it still  
<br>
failed.  Maybe this time it will work, so long as no one tries to  
<br>
bring Tatya into existence again.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But there is evidence that any animal we deal with attaches utility  
<br>
to its own survival.  Even if we knew nothing about genetics, Darwin,  
<br>
or even basic biology, simply observation would give us evidence as  
<br>
to this.  We can't even observe an SI, though, because none exists,  
<br>
thus we must look for other kinds of evidence, and currently we have  
<br>
none (or so claims Eliezer; he's the expert, not me; I certainly have  
<br>
none), thus the analogy doesn't fit.
<br>
<p>My guess is that you're most unsettled by the fact that Eliezer gave  
<br>
no evidence that there is no evidence.  But the fact that he's an  
<br>
expert in the field and claiming that there is no evidence is  
<br>
evidence of no evidence.  Bayesian evidence, anyway, which is the  
<br>
only kind that really counts.

<p>I'm not sure anyone serious advocates trying to control an arbitrary  
<br>
optimization process (OP*) anymore.  Through Eliezer's AI box  
<br>
experiments, and the simple realization that humans cannot conceive  
<br>
of everything, we know that, although boxing an arbitrary, let alone  
<br>
a superintelligent, OP might be an interesting thought experiment in  
<br>
AI engineering, it's not something we can rely on to protect us.
<br>
<p>I agree.  I think the best strategy anyone has yet developed that I  
<br>
know of is to build an OP that will (i) want to become  
<br>
superintelligent, and (ii) do so in a way we would want it to if we  
<br>
knew more, thought faster, etc..
