A recent post on Babel's Dawn [<a href="http://ebbolles.typepad.com/">http://ebbolles.typepad.com/</a> 
<br>
babels_dawn/2006/11/necessary_and_s.html] got me thinking, does an AI  
<br>
need attention?
<br>
<p>Certainly any optimizing process has &quot;attention&quot; in some sense:  when  
<br>
you press down on the toaster, you tell it to pay attention to  
<br>
putting electricity through high resistance wires to generate heat  
<br>
for a certain period of time.  But I think most of us would see this  
<br>
kind of attention as not quite the kind we're interested in since it  
<br>
lacks flexibility, i.e. a toaster can never pay attention to anything  
<br>
other than putting electricity through wires for a certain period of  
<br>
time.  If we want more flexibility, we need to design it into the  
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>For example, evolution &quot;designed&quot; humans with attentions flexible  
<br>
enough to focus on things other than what they encountered in the  
<br>
environment of evolutionary adaptation.  I can focus on writing this  
<br>
e-mail, even though no ancestor of mine past a few dozen generations  
<br>
ever typed, wrote, or read.  You might argue that this is too close  
<br>
to speech, but in some since that's my point.  We are flexible enough  
<br>
to focus on new things, but we typically focus on things in ways that  
<br>
can be extrapolated from the ways we focus on things we were  
<br>
&quot;designed&quot; to focus on.
<br>
<p>The most flexible attention would belong to a self-modifying  
<br>
intelligence who could pay attention to its attention and change it.   
<br>
Humans have some limited capacity to do this (think of the first time  
<br>
you saw a &quot;Where's Waldo&quot; puzzle versus the 5th or 10th time and how  
<br>
you payed attention to your attention to improve your technique), but  
<br>
they are ultimately limited by their brains' construction.  An AI  
<br>
could be programmed so that it could modify its attention, even to  
<br>
the point of modifying itself not to need attention.  So I ask again,  
<br>
does an AI need attention?
<br>
<p>In the style of LOGI, I think our only choice is to design an AI with  
<br>
attention and let it modify attention out of itself if that is a  
<br>
better design.  Our best model for how a to construct a general  
<br>
intelligence is the human brain, and humans have attentions, so we  
<br>
would do best to design our AI with attention, making sure it can get  
<br>
rid of it if that's a bad design.
<br>
<p>P.S.  Skimming through LOGI, it never seems to directly deal with the  
<br>
issue of AI attention, but just assumes it.  Maybe asking &quot;Does an AI  
<br>
need attention?&quot; could be an exercise for seed AI wannabes.  Speaking  
<br>
of which, maybe a list of exercises would be helpful to those folks  
<br>
(which, you know, could be constructed in the copious free time of  
<br>
Eliezer et al.).
