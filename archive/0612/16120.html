<p>
As an almost-PhD in AI, and having been to three different universities and
<br>
an AI research institute, my general thoughts are in line with Ben here.
<br>
<p>It depends A LOT on which university you are at and who your professor is.
<br>
One professor will have some specific work he wants done and your PhD
<br>
will be to do it.  Another will want you to come up with all your own ideas
<br>
and do your own thing, even if they are ideas that he doesn't believe in!
<br>
<p>Another thing is that departments have a tendency to become homogeneous
<br>
in their beliefs, probably I suspect through their hiring process.  One
<br>
department
<br>
will be all Bayesians, while another will have none.  One department will be
<br>
pro-neural networks, another will think that anything who is interested in
<br>
neural
<br>
networks must have some kind of mental deficiency.  Etc...  The same goes
<br>
for conferences, as you will find out.
<br>
