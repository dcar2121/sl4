</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My guess is that you're most unsettled by the fact that Eliezer gave no

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>For pity's sake, Eliezer, will you once and for all stop sending me the 
<br>
drivel from this ridiculous mailing list.
<br>
<p>I was amused, for a while, to note that you decided to still send me all 
<br>
the posts on SL4, but now I have had my fill of the kind of sycophantic 
<br>
garbage typified by the above &quot;But the fact that [Eliezer]'s an expert 
<br>
in the field and claiming that there is no evidence is evidence of no

<br>
<p>I wonder that you can even stand it yourself.
