Hello all, I have been lurking on this list for a while. I wanted to comment on this thread so I figured I would introduce myself in the same message. About me: I am also a beginning PhD student, at University of Tokyo. I am primarily interested in what has been referred to as &quot;cognitive AI&quot; or neuroscience-inspired AI. My group at Tokyo works on a field called &quot;cognitive robotics&quot;. The main premise of this research is that intelligence cannot be understood without situating the agent within a body (personally, I think this is an interesting claim, but I am ambivalent about it's stronger interpretations). This research was primarily inspired by Rodney Brooks. I just finished an MSc on discrete planning, which basically convinced me that GOFAI is not the way to go. I now think the main part of the Answer has to do with neural self-organization. So, I am interested in the information processing properties of self-organizing systems. On the topic of good knowledge to have, here are some people and ideas I find interesting/inspiring: Linsker (properties of neural systems self-organizing using Hebb's rule)Hinton/Dayan (unsupervised neural networks)Vapnik (statistical learning theory)Brooks (intelligence without reason/representation)Mumford/Grenander (pattern theory, in particular Lee-Mumford &quot;Hierarchical Bayesian inference in Visual Cortex&quot;)Viola/Jones (robust object recognition)Kaplan/Oudeyer/Steels (autotelic principle/progress drive)Hawkins (neural prediction, universal principles of learning) I wonder what other people think of the above list? My question: Following Ben's comment about his colleague who did his PhD while working for Novamente, can anyone formulate a specific question related to FAI that could plausibly be answered by a PhD thesis? In other words, what do people think are the well-defined problems (I am specifically interested in questions relating to the above topics, but feel that precise questions are generally Good Things)-Dan Burfoot&gt; Date: Wed, 6 Dec 2006 23:36:26 -0500&gt; From: <a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=RE:%20What%20are%20useful%20for%20a%20phd/JOIN%20Dan%20Burfoot">ben@goertzel.org</a>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:sl4@sl4.org?Subject=RE:%20What%20are%20useful%20for%20a%20phd/JOIN%20Dan%20Burfoot">sl4@sl4.org</a>&gt; Subject: Re: Re: Re: What are useful for a phd?&gt; &gt; &gt; A build-your-own PhD may result in an advisor who doesn't understand&gt; &gt; or care about your dissertation, and thus has no way of deciding when&gt; &gt; you are &quot;done&quot;.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Find a professor who has a grant, and a problem for you to work on.&gt; &gt; Work on it and graduate.&gt; &gt; Better yet, get an MS, get a job, be given a real problem to work on,&gt; &gt; and use it for your dissertation.&gt; &gt; Phil, I feel your advice is overly cynical!!!&gt; &gt; For instance, Moshe Looks (who works with me on Novamente), is just&gt; now wrapping up his PhD at Washington University (in CS).   What he&gt; did was:&gt; &gt; -- fund his PhD via working on a professor's research grant, i.e.&gt; working in their lab part of each week on some narrow-AI research&gt; &gt; -- do a PhD thesis on a topic of his own choice, closely tied to the&gt; Novamente AGI system but also with more academically acceptable&gt; narrow-AI aspects (see www. metacog.org)&gt; &gt; In terms of coursework, he took mostly CS courses as expected but also&gt; got permission to do some cog sci courses in the psychology&gt; department.&gt; &gt; His adviser is not extremely expert in his thesis area but is a&gt; lateral thinker, and was happy to supervise his thesis anyway.  His&gt; thesis committee includes a number of outsiders including myself and a&gt; couple folks from universities other than Wash. U.&gt; &gt; The point is, there actually is some flexibility in the graduate&gt; education system, if you find the right people and convince them you&gt; are capable of independent work and learning.&gt; &gt; I am not in love with contemporary academia by any means, but Phil,&gt; you seem to be overstating the case against it ;-)&gt; &gt; -- Ben G
