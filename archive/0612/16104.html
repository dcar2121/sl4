<em>&gt; Are you saying that you don't think that a superintelligence working

</em><br>
<p>That's a good point.
<br>
<p>I don't have a problem with a superintelligence having
<br>
self-preservation as a goal.  It's Asimov's 3rd Law, for example, and
<br>
yet the 1st 2 laws keep the robots firmly under the thumbs of the
<br>
humans.  The problem is with a superintelligence evolving a drive to
<br>
expand the proportion of resources it controls, especially if it acts
<br>
in a pre-emptive way, seizing control of resources only in order to
<br>
deny them to other intelligences, due to game-theoretic reasoning.
<br>
<p>Now that I think about it, it also makes sense that increasing the
<br>
resources that you control is a good strategy for accomplishing any
<br>
goal.  So it might be that even a single superintelligence will become
<br>
&quot;greedy&quot;.  It certainly seems that a pair of intelligences would each
<br>
become greedy, from game-theoretic considerations, unless they each
<br>
had reasons to believe that the other would not act greedily /
<br>
pre-emptively seize resources.
<br>
<p>This goes back to my call at the AGIRI conference for work, not just
<br>
on trying to make a single AI friendly, but on trying to figure out
<br>
what the starting conditions would be, in an AI ecosystem, that would
<br>
encourage cooperation rather than preemptive (&quot;greedy&quot;) competition.
