<em>&gt; Is logic not useful for FAI? If not, why not? For example,

<em>&gt; wouldn't these have some relevant non-monotonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reasoning, belief revision, ontology, commonsense reasoning,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why not?  Because people have banged their heads against it for
<br>
decades without accomplishing much.
<br>
<p>Logic is useful for engineering.  In your job, it would be good to be
<br>
able to use predicate logic.  Ontologies provide powerful data in many
<br>
ways, but you can get a lot with just the &quot;isa&quot; + &quot;instance-of&quot;
<br>
predicates, which is hardly logic.  Belief revision is important.
<br>
Constraint programming may be helpful.  Deontic logic is pretty
<br>
specialized, and I wouldn't study it unless I had a particular need
<br>
for it.
<br>
<p>But I doubt the value of learning logic beyond what you need to do
<br>
proofs and to program in Prolog, and then fuzzy logic and maybe
<br>
statistical/probabilistic logic.
<br>
<p>I don't know how much is useful, but clearly there are a lot of people
<br>
who go way too far.  Any time you see someone trying to prove that
<br>
their logic is complete and consistent, you know they've gone too far.
<br>
&nbsp;Any time someone is worrying over the implicational closure of belief
<br>
in their logic, they're going too far.  Whatever logic the brain uses
<br>
is neither complete nor consistent, nor does anyone work with the
<br>
logical closure of their beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for machine learning, besides bayesian and GA, how relevant do any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of you think the following are? SVM, reinforcement learning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gaussian process, Kolmogorov/Solomonoff etc. And, what other ML areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can I watch out for?
</em><br>
<p>Reinforcement learning apparenly occurs in the brain, so study that.
<br>
SVMs are powerful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't heard recommendation for AI planning, so I am a bit surprised.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Shouldn't a strong AI needs some sorts of planning?
</em><br>
<p>Planning is fun.  Sure, you should study planning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer: by Evolutionary psychology is it generally subsumed by  a cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science course?
</em><br>
<p>You mean, an Intro to Cognitive Science course?  Probably not.
<br>
It should be sufficient if you study psychology, and you study evolution.
