Dear Ben,

<p>You wrote:

<em>&gt; A question is: Can you conceive a set of tests with sufficient breadth
</em><br>
that,
<br>
<em>&gt; if an AGI system could pass them, it would be pretty damn clear the
</em><br>
system
<br>
<em>&gt; possessed a high degree of general intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The short answer is: yes.
<br>
<p>A slightly longer answer is:
<br>
I am reasonably confident I could formulate tests of AGI intelligence up
<br>
to a significant percentage of my own intelligence (say 80%).  These
<br>
tests could be Games set in any of the microdomains that I have
<br>
described in the Curriculum as long as there were no limits on the
<br>
number of bits allowed within the microdomain.
<br>
<p>&lt;Commentary&gt;
<br>
<p>I currently do not see any good reason to create such tests... but
<br>
perhaps I'm being myopic.  I want an AGI that can obtain a good
<br>
understanding of what human beings are.  I want it to be able to relate
<br>
to us, and 'take on our cause' - that is Friendliness.  In order to do
<br>
this I think that it is essential for the AGI to have interfaces with
<br>
the real-world in real-time... maybe not at first, but as early as
<br>
possible.  Let me give you an example why...
<br>
<p>Currently I know of you, Ben Goertzel, from email lists.  Also I have
<br>
read a number of your books and papers.  We work on Novamente, and share
<br>
personal emails.  But I have never met you 'in the flesh'.  And I
<br>
hesitate to say that I *know* you until I have spent time pal'ing
<br>
around, eating, jamming, arguing.  Without the richer interface of full
<br>
human senses in close proximity to the target data (you) my knowledge is
<br>
sharply limited.  I can only imagine that this will be *exactly the same
<br>
for an AGI*.  I am not being anthropomorphic, rather I am pointing to
<br>
the difference in breadth and volume of data between communicating
<br>
across the net and communicating face to face.
<br>
<p>It is certainly possible for me to reformat multiple types of sensorial
<br>
data and deliver it to any of the microdomains (allowing for unlimited
<br>
bits).  However this would be just raw data with *no preprocessing*.
<br>
And pre-processing *counts* as part of intelligence.  Human beings have
<br>
tons of pre-processing.  Are we expecting the AGI to creatively develop
<br>
its own pre-processing from scratch?  I don't think that is going to
<br>
happen.  We will have to give it some help.  I see that help coming in
<br>
two ways: 1) canned pre-processing routines that 'come with' a new
<br>
sensory input and 2) learned routines that we teach ver via a simpler
<br>
interface. I could expand the games in any of the microdomains to
<br>
present new routines... but the AGI would have to be able to take those
<br>
'presentations' and try them out for verself.  I do not plan to create
<br>
new pre-processing routines myself, just provide incremental lessons to
<br>
teach an AI how to follow any routine.
<br>
<p>So, to return to the specific point about 'understanding human
<br>
beings'... An AGI without the full suite of senses currently apportioned
<br>
to humans is going to be missing important things.  Some of those
<br>
things, I cannot even articulate, but I know 'em when I see 'em.  A
<br>
Friendly AGI is going to have to model humans quite closely... the
<br>
closer the better.  Currently we don't understand human cognition well
<br>
enough to explain it all to an AGI in advance... but we can at least
<br>
give it a good approximation of human experiential input and have it
<br>
draw its own conclusions.  Without this input, I don't believe an AGI is
<br>
going to have a very good model of us.  Should we not give ver as much
<br>
help as we can, as early as we can, to get it right?
<br>
<p>&lt;/Commentary&gt;
