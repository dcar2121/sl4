<p>
There is no lack of predictions for &quot;The end
<br>
of the world as we know it&quot; (TEOTWAWKI), and 
<br>
ways of coming up with new predictions. For
<br>
example: I'm an agnostic, but I came up with an
<br>
unscientific 'prediction' of 2027 based on
<br>
<p>(a) The most important date in Christ's life
<br>
was not his birth, but his crucifixtion,
<br>
(b) Our calendar is off by 6 years in counting
<br>
from his birth, and he was 33 when crucified,
<br>
(c) For some reason god likes time intervals
<br>
that are powers of 10.
<br>
<p>I think the above 'prediction' is a bunch of BS,
<br>
but it would sound plausible to a believer.
<br>
<p>The trick, then is not in getting predictions,
<br>
whether from the SL4 list or drug-induced
<br>
hallucinations, but in sorting out which ones
<br>
are more likely to be correct.  The usual rules
<br>
of science can be used in the sorting, since
<br>
science is all about theories which make predictions.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I would look at the theory that generated
<br>
the prediction, how well it explains past 
<br>
observations, how good it is in near-term future
<br>
predictions, and how well it fits the structure
<br>
of the rest of our knowledge of the world.
<br>
<p>--------------
<br>
<p>My theory on the dating of the singularity is
<br>
based on economics.  Humans get replaced by
<br>
machines for a given task when the machine is
<br>
less expensive.  Factories have long since
<br>
converted to electrically driven machinery since
<br>
you can get about 1000 times the power per
<br>
dollar as you can with manual labor.  My
<br>
employer, Boeing, now has robotic riveting
<br>
machines assembling airplane wings, since it
<br>
is a fairly simple, repetitive operation to
<br>
drill a hole and install a rivet (and the hole
<br>
locations can nowadays be pulled from a CAD
<br>
drawing).  Installing cable bundles are still
<br>
done by hand, though, since robots can't yet
<br>
match the capabilities of a human in that task.
<br>
<p>My prediction is that as computers continue to
<br>
improve, more and more tasks will get automated.
<br>
This includes the task of designing and manufacturing
<br>
the next generation of computers.  Therefore
<br>
we should see continuing rapid improvement in
<br>
computers, and productivity as a whole accelerating.
<br>
When we get to that time of fastest change (i.e.
<br>
the Singularity) is when computers not only assist
<br>
designers, as they do today, but entirely replace
<br>
teams of designers.  The cycle of improvement will
<br>
then not be limited by how fast you can design the
<br>
next generation, but rather how fast you can _build_
<br>
the next generation.
<br>
<p>To put some numbers to this theory, I estimate 
<br>
'economic crossover' for general design tasks based
<br>
on when computer power is cheaper than brain power. 
<br>
Human brain power is estimated to be equivalent to
<br>
100 TFlop to 100,000 Tflop.  A computer running
<br>
24x7 and working at 1 human design engineer equivalent
<br>
rate would be worth about $3 million.  So my
<br>
estimate is that when you can buy computers for
<br>
$30,000 to $30 per TFlop plus 7 years (to allow
<br>
time to usefully deploy the computers) is the
<br>
expected date for the Singularity.  We are 5-20
<br>
years from reaching the cost threshholds, so that
<br>
gives a prediction of 2015 to 2030.
