Cliff,
<br>
<p>You wrote: &quot;The only way I see of really reducing the overall complexity
<br>
of the programming task is if the system has some domain knowledge, some
<br>
knowledge of business rules, and the like.&quot;
<br>
<p>That works... and it is difficult too.
<br>
<p>There are tools that provide you with a 'blinkered window' into part of
<br>
the code/functionality.  That way, you only need to understand the part
<br>
that you are working on directly.  The rest can be ignored most of the
<br>
time (if it is properly modularized).  The various UML tools are a step
<br>
in the right direction, allowing a 'blinkered window' to enough
<br>
contextual information so that a maintenance programmer (one who didn't
<br>
originally write the code and so doesn't have it all 'in vis head') can
<br>
grasp the workings of part of a system by accessing the highly organized
<br>
information about the *sub-problem* being solved, and exactly how the
<br>
program solves it.  The trouble with this approach right now is, that
<br>
the tools take an enormous amount of getting comfortable with before
<br>
they become useful... the ramp-up investment is steep.  Therefore it is
<br>
only worth the learning investment for really large projects.
<br>
<p>You are also *spot on* with the 'levels of abstraction' comment IMO.
<br>
Especially when applied to the code itself.  The main reason so called
<br>
'Enterprise Application Integration' software has been a hot topic these
<br>
last couple of years is because it provides a level of abstraction that
<br>
allows communication between disparate systems - and does so in a
<br>
somewhat flexible manner.  What ends up happening is: even though a
<br>
large company's systems are all intimately connected, a programmer
<br>
working on one system doesn't need to know all about the other systems -
<br>
only the *interface* definition of the other systems.  This cuts down
<br>
what you need to know, sometimes by an order of magnitude!
<br>
<p>I think this is what Lanier was getting at in his comments: creating
<br>
interfaces that are:
<br>
<p>a) self configuring and
<br>
b) self recognising
<br>
<p>So that programs could be assembled like building blocks with generic
<br>
interfaces, rather than as gestalt crystals.
<br>
