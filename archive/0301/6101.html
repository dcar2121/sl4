<p>
For the past two weeks I've been lurking through sl4 and various closely 
<br>
related forums, and now I've decided that it's time to join the community.  
<br>
My name is Timothy Moenk, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at 
<br>
Georgia State University (Though I'm taking this semester off due to a car 
<br>
accident involving a pedestrian.. and yes, I was the pedestrian) and an 
<br>
aspiring author.  That I am currently aware of, I have two main drives in 
<br>
life.  The first of these being the pursuit of self knowledge.  Thus my 
<br>
interests reside in philosophy, psychology, and the like.  My other drive, 
<br>
and I acknowledge that it may sound a bit cliche, is to change the world in 
<br>
some meaningful way.  This drive has also fueled my interests in philosophy 
<br>
and sociology, but also my interest in technology at a very young age.
<br>
<p>I became aware of nanotech a few years ago and knew intuitively of the 
<br>
potential that it holds, but I haven't actively kept up with the field (if 
<br>
it might be called that) until just recently.  There was a time four years 
<br>
ago in which I read everything I could get my hands on concerning nanotech, 
<br>
but I couldn't yet find the public forums to discuss the ideas in my mind.  
<br>
I'm sure that many people on this list have experienced the birth of a 
<br>
novel idea in their own minds, only to find months or years later that 
<br>
another individual or groups of individuals had also come up with the idea 
<br>
on their own and run with it.  I've been experiencing this on an hourly 
<br>
basis the past two weeks.  As it currently stands, I think that I've read 
<br>
most of my thoughts and ideas in one form or another on this clusteral side 
<br>
of the internet.  And so, it is apparent that I have much more reading to 
<br>
do before I feel I can contribute much to this community.
<br>
<p>Even though I've only just recently heard the term, I would have to 
<br>
consider myself a transhumanist.  The transhumanist philosophy is one that 
<br>
has been fostering itself in my mind for a few years now.  I would say that 
<br>
there are areas where I diverge with the mainstream philosophy(who doesn't 
<br>
though?) , but on the whole I have to acknowledge that it is still a 
<br>
developing philosophy just as any socially alive philosophy is.  So I 
<br>
suppose I will leave the topic of defining myself in relation to 
<br>
transhumanism alone.  Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to meet Eliezer 
<br>
when he invited me to the local (Atlanta)  meeting of transhumanists.  I 
<br>
greatly enjoyed this gathering and intend to continue attendance.  I found 
<br>
much of the conversation to be very stimulating (not to mention humbling.. 
<br>
for the most part I remained rather silent as I was taking things in), and 
<br>
wish to become more acquainted with everyone that I met there (and also the 
<br>
ones that I didn't have a chance to meet at the time).  It's going to take 
<br>
a natural disaster (or perhaps a synthetic disaster of similar magnitude) 
<br>
to keep me away from the next meeting.
<br>
<p>In any case, I just wanted to let everyone know of my existence and that 
<br>
I'm here.  As I don't yet feel comfortable with the knowledge base I have 
<br>
to draw from, I don't think I'll be making much of a contribution at first, 
<br>
but then again perhaps expanding my base of knowledge will be enough for 
<br>
now as an investment for the future.  As most of you have probably already 
<br>
noticed, I tend to be rather verbose in my writing.  I could -try-to tone 
<br>
it down a bit if anyone thinks I'm a bit too long winded, but otherwise I 
<br>
can't really help it.  I've been long winded ever since I was first 
<br>
introduced to the keyboard in elementary school.  Although amongst this 
<br>
crowd, I don't think I should anticipate any of the usual objections to my 
<br>
writing..
<br>
<p>Anyways, Greetings.  And here's to the future we shall create.
<br>
<p>-Timothy Moenk
