<p>If you mean the Penrose/Hameroff (QM) thing? Me either. IMO way too

complicated, assumes this weird proto-quantum-consciousness stuff
<br>
(ultimately) and probably too computationally brittle although my mind is

open to the possibility. It does, however, make the list of potential

'phenomena X' have a length of at least 1.
<br>
<p>If you mean 'physicalist' solutions in general, then I'm not convinced, yet.
<br>
I can't rule it out. Not enough work has been done on it by physicists. The
<br>
philosophers have given us colourblind mary, red fred, duplicate earths,
<br>
zombies and a chinese room. Fun, but nothing I can build!
<br>
<p>The other main physicalist candidate X is the 'electromagnetic theory' (EM).
<br>
That makes the X-list of length 2. My list length will remain 2 unless
<br>
someone can see something else in there. The former (QM) uses the
<br>
cytoskeleton. The latter (EM) uses everything that isn't the cytoskeleton.
<br>
Kind of limits our list a little, doesn't it? Nothing left except maybe a
<br>
grab-bag of mysterianism. If both EM and QM are wrong we are left with the
<br>
computational (knowledge/functionalism) emergence option.
<br>
<p>My bet? If I have to choose a physicalist X, it's X = EM. I am unable to
<br>
rule out EM yet.
<br>
<p>Any other candidates? Anyone?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I do agree that there is a lot we don't understand about

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I am not at all sure that we need to fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, in order to create an AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, we don't need to fully understand the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an engine.  And we don't need to fully understand the nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and origin of life to create an artificial organism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a project Craig Venter and his team are now working on).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Assuming X is real and needed, I'm sure the lack of a full description of X
<br>
will not stop anybody making something that has it. Like the engine, we
<br>
built a lot of them to work out how they worked. We just made really bad
<br>
ones for a while.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In another decade, you and I may be chatting on this list with an AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, mutually pondering the mysterious and beautiful nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness we all share...
</em><br>
<p>I am so looking forward to that day! Let's make is WILL, not a MAY. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having said that, I do have my own speculations regarding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I'll briefly share.  I stress that these speculations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are only loosely related to my own practical AGI work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly: As for the &quot;X-factor&quot; underlying consciousness, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomness, which I believe must be considered subjectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- &quot;randomness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with respect to a particular observer.&quot;  [Roughly speaking, X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is random with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to observer O if O cannot produce a better program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for computing X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than &quot;list the components of X&quot;.  This has been extensively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formalized in algorithmic information theory.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK. So we have a new possible X. When I look at it, however, qualia remain a
<br>
functionalist emergence pumped by a physical randomness. The qualia are not
<br>
expressed directly by the X, so it doesn't really fit the requirements for
<br>
being an X. Qualia are still a computational emergence albeit sitting on a
<br>
physical phenomenon (randomness). The solution is - from the point of view
<br>
of production of qualia - a functionalist solution.
<br>
<p>Have I characterised it correctly? If so the number of physical Xs remains
<br>
2, but we have another &quot;arrow in the functionalist quiver&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; More specifically...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mind of a physical system is a fuzzy set whose elements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are drawn from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the set of patterns in that system.  The set of patterns in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the system form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an &quot;emergent dynamical system&quot; related to, but different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from, the dynamical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system of the physical system itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The dynamics of the mind-system associated with a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, may be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some extent unpredictable (i.e. random) with respect to *the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself*.  This leads toward the phenomenon of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The *intensity* of consciousness has to do with the rate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flux between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random and ordered realms, occurring in a mind-system.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns in portions of the mind-system that were previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opaque to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-system, and the decent into opacity of portions of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were previously patterned (in the mind-systems's own perspective).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is yet another one of those interesting lines of thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I've put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the back-burner for a while, focusing instead on revising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the in-process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente book, and on Novamente-based product engineering...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if this line of thinking is at all on-target, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is a systemic, emergent phenomenon, not tied to any
</em><br>
particular
<br>
<em>&gt; physical phenomenon.
</em><br>
<p>The semantics of the word 'consciousness' have to be carefully crafted here.
<br>
You and I probably think different things. In my little parochial analytical
<br>
world, consciousness is a process, not a phenomenon. When it's fully running
<br>
we are awake :-). It has contents which are 'awarenesses', some of which are
<br>
coloured/labelled with qualia. I suspect that is not what you mean by
<br>
consciousness. Messy one. I think we understand each other, though. :-)
<br>
<p>That said, it comes down to whether you would have pure computational
<br>
artifacts express qualia or physical phenomenon X express qualia. The former
<br>
makes it a whole bunch easier for a computer scientist to do an AGI.
<br>
<p>I agree with you that if the qualia are a pure computational artifact, that
<br>
randonmess could play a significant role in driving the patterns. A little
<br>
computational universe with qualia forming and precipitating out of
<br>
nothingness. Equivalent to particles from quantum froth, yes?
<br>
<p>Try as I might, though, I can't make myself buy into the pure computational
<br>
emergence solution yet. The EM world has a lot of undiscovered country.
<br>
<p>The telling thing will be in the early AGI models. Remember the 3rd or 4th?
<br>
'Alien' movie? There was a single remnant 'synthetic' that survived a
<br>
product recall. The rest were trashed because they 'felt too much' and
<br>
became useless as slave/drones. They had better moral backbone than humans!
<br>
They truly felt existential angst and acted on it so much it stopped them
<br>
being useful. Humans preferred their homer simpson drones. :-) It may
<br>
actually turn out a bit like that.
<br>
<p>If the X phenomenon is truly needed, early AGI work that excludes it will
<br>
produce a sort of greyed out, not quite there creature that we'll all think
<br>
just doesn't get it. However, as a product maybe that's what we want. As
<br>
long as it shuts up and does the vacuuming, who cares :-). I think there's
<br>
room for all outcomes. Why would an AGI drone that maintains a road
<br>
intersection and lives in a hole in the ground want a fully fledged
<br>
sentience with all the trimmings of a human?
<br>
<p>If there is no physical phenomenon X, then we'll get our artificial poet
<br>
with computational emergence, somehow. The AGI will have to 'see' and react
<br>
to patterns in the shape of its executing code (some of which is created by
<br>
sensing)- from outside the code -  then feed the 'experience' back inside
<br>
the code. This the nature of the required computational emergence, isn't it?
<br>
(It's the emergence you described above, expressed slightly differently).
<br>
Exactly analogous to the physical X version, but without a physical carrier
<br>
in which the 'experience' is expressed - a 'virtual carrier' of qualia is
<br>
created, if you like. As long as there is no human involvement
<br>
(coding/prescription) in the loops... out pops qualia ..pain, red, cold..
<br>
Hmmm. I Can't see this happening in traditional software at all. A
<br>
hardware'd functional language - CA maybe. Hardware Haskell? Definitely not
<br>
in an 'imperative' type language in any form.
<br>
<p>Thinking out loud again. Sorry.
<br>
<p>If an X is needed and not obvious, the 'functionalist emergence' solution
<br>
may actually have to be tried and fail in order to force us to accept one of
<br>
the X candidates. What a gut wrenching experience! I'd better find and prove
<br>
an X then, and quickly, eh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I suspect that a correct understanding of consciousness as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systemic, emergent phenomenon *may* be helpful in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical universe -- the quantum theory of measurement, Grand

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>When we get qualia sorted out, I think we'll get emergence sorted as well
<br>
and a new version of 'reality' thrown into the bargain.
<br>
<p>Bruno et al on the 'everything' list have physics, at its very highest
<br>
limits, looking a bit like psychology. Ben, you may get your wish yet!
<br>
<p>The year is afoot! Gotta go play. Good luck with your physicalist phenomena
<br>
X.
<br>
Whatever they are.
