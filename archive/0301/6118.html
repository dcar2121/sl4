<p>BG&gt; Well, Jaron is right that standard software development processes don't work
<br>
BG&gt; well for large projects.  We discovered this at Webmind Inc. trying to build
<br>
BG&gt; the Webmind AI Engine!  Testing and debugging that system was the bitch to
<br>
BG&gt; end all bitches.... As a result, we tried really hard to make the Novamente
<br>
BG&gt; design smaller (though it's still much bigger than we'd like... we're always
<br>
BG&gt; looking for things to eliminate from it ;)
<br>
<p>BG&gt; I agree that a radically different approach to programming would help a lot.
<br>
<p>BG&gt; And I have a candidate for such an approach: Supercompilation.  See
<br>
BG&gt; www.supercompilers.com.  A fully functional supercompiler for Java or C# or
<br>
BG&gt; even LISP would allow programmers to
<br>
<p>BG&gt; 1) write code for simplicity and transparency and maintainability
<br>
BG&gt; 2) have the supercompiler turn it into plausibly efficient code
<br>
<p>I agree that being able to write code &quot;just for functionality&quot;
<br>
(without concern for efficiency) simplifies matters -- it can surely
<br>
result in much more transparent code, and I'm honestly surprised that
<br>
the general approach of separating the code representation from the
<br>
implementation hasn't been more widely pursued.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But, I don't think this is the real problem with *large systems*.  The
<br>
real problem with large systems is that they're too large to hold in
<br>
anyone's mind at once.  Holding a high-level design in your mind while
<br>
working on a bit of code that's levels of magnitude lower down in your
<br>
concept hierarchy is common in programming, and becomes more difficult
<br>
as the number of levels of magnitude in the system increases.
<br>
<p>Breaking a large system into chunks (for multiple programmers to work
<br>
on, or a single programmer to work on at different times) doesn't
<br>
really help, because the interdependencies generally increase in a
<br>
non-linear way (e.g., the number of calls between modules might grow
<br>
exponentially with the number of modules the system is broken up
<br>
into). 
<br>
<p>It's really a matter of levels of abstraction...abstraction always
<br>
leaves out the details, and right now either a) you, the programmer,
<br>
fill them in or b) they get encoded from your abstraction (higher
<br>
level language) in an *entirely strict, and thus brittle* way.  Right
<br>
now, the person with access to the highest level programming interface
<br>
might be Bill Gates, because he could say &quot;make me a Space Invaders
<br>
with students and desks instead of aliens and bases&quot; -- and the
<br>
programmers can fill out some details without him specifying them,
<br>
e.g., the students are throwing pieces of chalk.  Or he could say
<br>
&quot;make me a Java, but without the suck&quot; and the programmers could fill
<br>
in the details...
<br>
<p>I don't think supercompilation or formal computing, valuable as they
<br>
are in their own right, are sufficient to make the task of programming
<br>
a complex system any less complex.  Hard is hard.
<br>
<p>So I strongly suspect it will take good AI approaches to write reliable
<br>
large systems in reasonable timeframes (i.e. in timeframes people are
<br>
willing to spend the money on).  I'm not sure a near-human-equivalent
<br>
AGI is necessary for this, however -- IMO, a limited domain trainable
<br>
AI interfacing between the user and the OS might be a valuable initial
<br>
approach to this problem. 
<br>
<p>(In fact, you could describe today's GUIs as very brittle, very
<br>
narrow, untrainable AI systems -- initially more intuitive visually,
<br>
but using metaphors that break unintuitively.  I think bringing some
<br>
existing trainable but relatively narrow AI technology, existing NLP
<br>
technology, and existing speech-recognition technology together in an
<br>
interface layer between user and OS/GUI could result in a much nicer
<br>
user experience.  But I digress.) 
<br>
<p>The formal programming approach may give near-100% reliability, but
<br>
for really large systems the writing of the *specification itself*
<br>
becomes the problem, IMO...
<br>
<p>Suppose you have to implement a nationwide payroll system, and the new
<br>
tax code has come out.  You still have to have people figuring out how
<br>
to encode it all -- people who know that the ST field contains the
<br>
&quot;state&quot;, say (in order to look it up to apply that state's rules);
<br>
people who know that a negative payroll tax isn't possible (so that
<br>
they'll immediately catch that as a bug), etc.  The only way I see of
<br>
really reducing the overall complexity of the programming task is if
<br>
the system has some domain knowledge, some knowledge of business
<br>
rules, and the like. 
<br>
<p>I don't think you need full AGI or full &quot;concept grounding&quot; to make at
<br>
least marginal inroads, e.g., for a system to have some
<br>
pseudo-abstract concept of State such that it can recognize that data
<br>
field ST in this table corresponds with data field PAYOR_STATE in
<br>
that table it downloaded from elsewhere (perhaps by comparing the
<br>
different values cross-referenced with a state abbreviation list --
<br>
e.g., doing some pattern matching -- and then asking the programmer
<br>
for confirmation).  There are limited tools along these lines (e.g.,
<br>
&quot;automated&quot; Y2K conversion tools that would trawl through COBOL code
<br>
looking for stuff which might be dates) but nothing AFAIK that tries
<br>
to approach programming in general as an AI/UI problem.
