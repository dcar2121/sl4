</em><br>
<p>This is very close to what we do developing
<br>
software for the Space Station.  We have 8 people
<br>
in the Requirements group, who write the
<br>
specifications, then check the code and the
<br>
test suite fulfills the specifications.  We have
<br>
12 designers who actually write the code, and
<br>
finally we have 32 people (including myself) who
<br>
test the software.  The stuff we are developing
<br>
is the lower level control software that directly
<br>
controls fans and pumps, and reports temperature
<br>
and atmosphere composition.  The higher tier,
<br>
which involves astronaut interface, mission
<br>
control, and programmed sequences of commands,
<br>
is done elsewhere.  Most of our testing is at
<br>
the level of one function in one CPU's software
<br>
being exahustively tested for every possible
<br>
input condition.
<br>
<p>For example, there is a valve that can shut off
<br>
the flow of cooling water in a space station
<br>
module (critical components are water cooled so
<br>
they can continue to operate even if the module
<br>
loses it's atmosphere).  The valve is controlled
<br>
by signals from one of the onboard computers, and
<br>
sends back 2 sensor signals from two contacts,
<br>
one that is made when the valve is closed, and
<br>
the other when the valve is open.  We test for
<br>
all four possible sensor combinations (open,
<br>
closed, transition (no contact on either sensor),
<br>
and fault (contact on both sensors, which should
<br>
be physically impossible).
<br>
<p>We tested each command for each valve state (i.e.
<br>
issue a close valve command when the valve is
<br>
already closed).
<br>
<p>At each stage the other groups review each others
<br>
work.  So when the specifiction is being written,
<br>
design and test consider whether they can write
<br>
and test to that spec.  Conversely at the test
<br>
end, requirements and design consider whether our
<br>
test suite adequately covers the specified
<br>
performance, and exercises the flight code.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is this well-known approach not followed very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly COST ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secondly IGNORANCE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The formal approach takes a long time, and it takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensive people (people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a grasp of math as well as programming).  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes more $$ spent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software testing than most companies want to spend.
</em><br>
<p>Space Station software has been in development for
<br>
10 years, and it isn't cheap.  On the plus side,
<br>
it's been functioning in orbit for 4 years with
<br>
no major problems. Yes, there have been bugs, but
<br>
they have been minor.
<br>
<p>In addition to being very careful with the software,
<br>
we were very careful to design critical systems
<br>
(where a failure would kill the crew or destroy
<br>
the station) so that no single computer, software,
<br>
human, or hardware failure would by itself be
<br>
critical.  We also took into account statistical
<br>
failure rates for equipment, and added backup units
<br>
where needed to bring the risk down to the
<br>
required level.  The major remaining risk, which
<br>
we couldn't do much about, was natural and manmade
<br>
objects running into the station.  There's about
<br>
a 1-2% chance per year of a hull penetration by
<br>
such objects, and the effect of something big
<br>
enough to punch through the 1 cm aluminum walls
<br>
is at least the energy equivalent of a hand
<br>
grenade.  And most anywhere in the Station, behind
<br>
the pressure shell there is equipment of some
<br>
kind - so the effect will be bits of hardware
<br>
flying everywhere.  That's the main reason
<br>
for an emergency escape capsule at the Station.
<br>
The poor soul who happened to be in a module when
<br>
something penetrates it will be dead from
<br>
(a) shockwave, (b) shrapnel, and (c) loss of
<br>
pressure.  The rest of the crew is supposed to
<br>
close the hatches behind them, and get out in
<br>
the escape capsule.
