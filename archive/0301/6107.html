<p>
Well, Jaron is right that standard software development processes don't work
<br>
well for large projects.  We discovered this at Webmind Inc. trying to build
<br>
the Webmind AI Engine!  Testing and debugging that system was the bitch to
<br>
end all bitches.... As a result, we tried really hard to make the Novamente
<br>
design smaller (though it's still much bigger than we'd like... we're always
<br>
looking for things to eliminate from it ;)
<br>
<p>I agree that a radically different approach to programming would help a lot.
<br>
<p>And I have a candidate for such an approach: Supercompilation.  See
<br>
www.supercompilers.com.  A fully functional supercompiler for Java or C# or
<br>
even LISP would allow programmers to
<br>
<p>1) write code for simplicity and transparency and maintainability
<br>
2) have the supercompiler turn it into plausibly efficient code
<br>
<p>This would make a HUGE difference in programming practice.
<br>
<p>What's needed to make this a reality is perhaps $1M in venture capital or
<br>
research money for Supercompilers LLC.  (Full disclosure: I'm involved with
<br>
that firm, though not in a central role.)
<br>
<p>Short of supercompilation or some comparable technical advance, however,
<br>
Jaron's article also overlooks what is clearly the most advanced and
<br>
promising route to the creation of reliable software: formal methods.
<br>
<p>The formal approach to software engineering is pretty simple really...
<br>
<p>1) Create a mathematical specification of one's software in a specification
<br>
language like Z, Object Z, etc.
<br>
<p>2) One can then prove with mathematical rigor that one's software will
<br>
perform according to the requirements, if its implemented according to the
<br>
specifications
<br>
<p>3) Translate the mathematical specification into a software program.  This
<br>
is easier if one uses a language that doesn't involve pointers.  It's not so
<br>
hard with Java for example; it could be done with a variation of the toolkit
<br>
the Java supercompiler (www.supercompilers.com) team is creating.  It's
<br>
really easy with nice languages like LISP or ML.  This step could in
<br>
principle be fully automated, but in practice right now it really has to be
<br>
done by hand or by humans interacting with software like the supercompiler,
<br>
because only humans know how to make the right decisions regarding
<br>
efficiency optimization.
<br>
<p>4) Check the software program against the specification carefully, using
<br>
repeated code inspections, unit tests, and black and white box system tests.
<br>
<p>If this approach is followed, one will have software that is fantastically
<br>
more reliable than most software produced this way.
<br>
<p>Why is this well-known approach not followed very often?
<br>
<p>Firstly COST ...
<br>
<p>secondly IGNORANCE
<br>
<p>The formal approach takes a long time, and it takes expensive people (people
<br>
with a grasp of math as well as programming).  It takes more $$ spent on
<br>
software testing than most companies want to spend.
<br>
<p>(We are NOT taking this approach in Novamente, but we have a very small and
<br>
tightly-integrated team, which makes an informal approach significantly more
<br>
reliable.)
<br>
<p>In short, I think we could do a lot better than we do right now, simply by
<br>
allocating our software dev. spending differently.
<br>
<p>And we could do a LOT LOT better with a bit of investment money put into
<br>
radical software technologies like supercompilation.
<br>
<p>These ideas may not be along the lines that Jaron is thinking, but, I think
<br>
they can provide substantial partial solutions to the problem he points out.
