</em><br>
<p>Five levels doesn't mean five modules - there is a lot of additional
<br>
complexity you need to support the more complex levels of processing. At a
<br>
bare minimum, an attempted AGI would need:
<br>
<p>1) Low-level Data Management - A commercial RDBMS could do this job, but if
<br>
you don't use one you're going to have a big job to do just handling the
<br>
mechanics of shuffling bits around.
<br>
2) Programming Tools - No one existing tool can do everything you need, so
<br>
you're going to have to cobble together a set of tools and a runtime
<br>
environment that support all the capabilities you need.
<br>
<p>Then you get to the actual AI work:
<br>
3) At least one sensory modality (if only to it can accept input text).
<br>
4) At least one effecter system (if only so it can output text messages).
<br>
5) A world model, which is updated by 3 and possibly 4.
<br>
6) A deliberation subsystem, capable of reasoning about the contents of the
<br>
world model.
<br>
7) A goal system.
<br>
8) An attention-management system, which guides the operation of the AI.
<br>
<p>There are also a lot of connections between these subsystems (for example,
<br>
items 3-8 probably all need specialized facilities for creating and using
<br>
different kinds of memories).
<br>
<p>Now, others may quibble over which subsystems are essential, but it should
<br>
be obvious that there is a lot of complexity here. Even a toy version of any
<br>
one of these items would make a good 1-2 year project for a lone developer.
<br>
Making a real, useful version of something like a sensory modality or a
<br>
world model can keep a good programming team busy for years, and the
<br>
complexity of the system grows rapidly as you add more subsystems.
<br>
<p>So, even a toy system to display the different parts could take a decade or
<br>
more for a single developer to build. A system with a reasonably robust
<br>
implementation of each subsystem would take at least dozens, and more likely
<br>
hundreds, of man-years. While this scale of work is well within the reach of
<br>
big software companies, it isn't very practical for AI researchers.
