<p>
Mitchell,
<br>
<p>You seem to be moving in the direction of something like the
<br>
Webmind/Novamente design, which does in fact synthesize elements of neural
<br>
nets, logic (probabilistic combinatory term logic, not standard Prolog-style
<br>
logic), and a number of methods for concept formation bridging the two
<br>
levels.
<br>
<p>What one finds when one goes in this direction -- or at least what I
<br>
found -- is that the details of the existing approaches to NN's logic, and
<br>
concept formation do NOT WORK when one tries to use them as components of an
<br>
integrated system.  In practice, one has to rebuild ALL of these things from
<br>
scratch, inspired by the existing literature, in order to get them to work
<br>
as part of an integrative system.
<br>
<p>For me, the process of doing this rebuilding took 5 years -- from 1997-2002.
<br>
The Webmind AI Engine was only a partial success in this regard -- it was
<br>
too much of an awkward combination of different things.  With the Novamente
<br>
design, created in 2001, I feel we've finally &quot;gotten it right&quot; in the sense
<br>
of creating a detailed design that incorporates the aspects you mention but
<br>
in an elegantly unified way.  But it's NOT simple -- I spent much of 2002
<br>
just trying to write up the design in a clear and complete way (while my
<br>
colleagues have worked on the C++ implementation, which is far from
<br>
complete).  Now my collaborator Cassio Pennachin will spend a lot of 2003
<br>
turning my writeup into a really professional product.. and the resulting
<br>
1200+ page book will come out in 2004, by which point we'll hopefully have
<br>
50%+ of the Novamente design implemented and tested...
<br>
<p>In short, I very much appreciate your intuition, but, you  must be aware
<br>
that the step from your informal sketch to something vaguely workable is a
<br>
HUGE step with numerous difficult substeps...
<br>
<p>I'm sure that Novamente is not the only way to flesh out this sort of
<br>
intuition either -- it's just the best way that I and my collaborators have
<br>
happened upon -- so far --
<br>
<p><p>-- Ben Goertzel
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; I think we are in dire need of such didactic prototypes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if there is ever to be a *coding community* working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this thing. There has to be a common understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basic concepts, and I'm not convinced that that exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So - there are five levels: code, modality, concept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, deliberation. What I'm going to do is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informally sketch something which *sounds to me* like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has all those levels.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Code - no problem here, every program is made of code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Modality - Above all, a modality seems to be a *feature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extractor*, operating in a specific domain. The input is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort of raw data set, static or dynamic, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; output is a representation as a list of features, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objects with features. Well, neural nets can do all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Concept, thought, deliberation - In LOGI, these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described as analogous to word, sentence, stream of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness. So it seems that *propositional content*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think Prolog) might be enough for those top two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels - 'sentences' in some internal language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation. The AI needs to produce descriptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences which express what its modalities tell it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and normative sentences which express its intentions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can get those, there is a wealth of symbolic AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work on putting them to use in a rational fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, the key concept seems to be 'concept', and the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it bridges the gap between subsymbolic feature extraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and symbolic-level propositional processing. Well, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple way to do that is to have concepts which are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists of features. Each modality outputs an inventory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of features possessed by its current input; the art of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate concept formation is all about picking out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a few of those features as 'co-relevant', worthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being grouped together. And Copycat provides a model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for *that* process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It looks to me like we already have all the ingredients,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not for a seed AI, but certainly for a &quot;general AI&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined by LOGI.
</em><br>
