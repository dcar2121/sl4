This kind of economic analysis seems reasonable to me. However, the
<br>
quantitative guesstimates for human-equivalent computations, cost per
<br>
computational unit, and time for useful deployment are too uncertain IMO to
<br>
give us much help in pinning down the date range for the Singularity. For
<br>
example, the time for useful deployment (measured in terms of increased
<br>
productivity) may be much shorter for the coming generation of machines than
<br>
it was for the PC revolution.
<br>
<p>A useful indicator here is the article in the current (Feb. 2003) issue of
<br>
Scientific American on electronic circuits designed via genetic algorithms.
<br>
The human developers/authors rigged a 1,000 chip Pentium supercomputer to
<br>
run their software. It &quot;reinvented&quot; many patented circuits and at least one
<br>
novel design, which the authors are in the process of trying to patent.

Article: &quot;Evolving Inventions&quot; By John R. Koza, Martin A. Keane and Matthew
<br>
J. Streeter.
<br>
&quot;Evolution is an immensely powerful creative process. From the intricate
<br>
biochemistry of individual cells to the elaborate structure of the human
<br>
brain, it has produced wonders of unimaginable complexity. Evolution
<br>
achieves these feats with a few simple processes--mutation, sexual
<br>
recombination and natural selection--which it iterates for many generations.
<br>
Now computer programmers are harnessing software versions of these same
<br>
processes to achieve machine intelligence. Called genetic programming, this
<br>
technique has designed computer programs and electronic circuits that
<br>
perform specified functions.
<br>
In the field of electronics, genetic programming has duplicated 15
<br>
previously patented inventions, including several that were hailed as
<br>
seminal in their respective fields when they were first announced. Six of
<br>
these 15 existing inventions were patented after January 2000 by major
<br>
research institutions, which indicates that they represent current frontiers
<br>
of research in domains of scientific and practical importance. Some of the
<br>
automatically produced inventions infringe squarely on the exact claims of
<br>
the previously patented inventions. Others represent new inventions by
<br>
duplicating the functionality of the earlier device in a novel way. One of
<br>
these inventions is a clear improvement over its predecessor. Genetic
<br>
programming has also classified protein sequences and produced
<br>
human-competitive results in a variety of areas, such as the design of
<br>
antennas, mathematical algorithms and general-purpose controllers. We have
<br>
recently filed for a patent for a genetically evolved general-purpose
<br>
controller that is superior to mathematically derived controllers commonly
<br>
used in industry. ...&quot;

<br>
<em>&gt; My theory on the dating of the singularity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on economics.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To put some numbers to this theory, I estimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'economic crossover' for general design tasks based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on when computer power is cheaper than brain power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human brain power is estimated to be equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 TFlop to 100,000 Tflop.  A computer running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 24x7 and working at 1 human design engineer equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rate would be worth about $3 million.  So my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; estimate is that when you can buy computers for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $30,000 to $30 per TFlop plus 7 years (to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time to usefully deploy the computers) is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected date for the Singularity.  We are 5-20
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years from reaching the cost threshholds, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives a prediction of 2015 to 2030.
