Ben Goertzel:
<br>
BG&gt; I do not think Michael's tests are anywhere near adequate as a
<br>
BG&gt; training regime for a baby AI.
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames:
<br>
MRA&gt; It depends on the design... but I get your point.  Many AGI design types
<br>
MRA&gt; will require a large quantity of experiential learning.  I have not
<br>
MRA&gt; attempted to describe that because different designs will require
<br>
MRA&gt; different lessons and learning situations.  Instead the Curriculum
<br>
MRA&gt; focuses on what might be called 'book learning'.  Lessons that every AGI
<br>
MRA&gt; is going to have to learn in order to make progress.  I will make this
<br>
MRA&gt; clearer in my next version.
<br>
<p>I think the basic outline of your curriculum is well thought out, and
<br>
I look forward to future, more complete versions.
<br>
<p>However, I'm not certain what level of learning ability represented
<br>
will require training; I suspect some of the lower levels of learning
<br>
will be built into any AGI hierarchy.  I do think the curriculum
<br>
offers an intriguing view of the successive levels of abstraction
<br>
involved in thinking.  In particular, I can imagine an intelligence
<br>
having an &quot;aha!&quot; moment during lesson 14 and at various points during
<br>
the sublessons of 16.
<br>
<p>I think the curriculum's ultimate utility may be as an AI methodology
<br>
testing ground: a test where &quot;you can't accidentally hardcode the
<br>
relevant heuristics in&quot; (as has happened in some past AI projects) --
<br>
and possibly, depending on how the curriculum develops, a test where
<br>
you can't do that even on purpose (because the tasks involved reach a
<br>
certain level of complexity).  If the latter is possible it could
<br>
lead to a more easily automatable, and arguably more objective, test
<br>
than the current forms of the Turing test.
<br>
<p>The lessons of Semester 1 seem the most useful and coherent to me, so
<br>
far.  I'd like to see Lesson 16 fleshed out/expanded into multiple
<br>
lessons.  I'd be very interested in lessons which explored algorithmic
<br>
design in more detail, e.g., provide sample datasets of input and
<br>
output, with the task being to create an algorithm; further lessons
<br>
that value the algorithm with the fewest steps, etc.
<br>
<p>Semesters 2 - 4 might be more useful if the AGI is given some sort of
<br>
embodiment in the microdomain -- some way of effecting change and
<br>
observing its results.  E.g., if it can build a mental model of the
<br>
&quot;physics&quot; of a microdomain by experimentation, in order to solve a
<br>
microdomain task.
<br>
<p>You're doing a great job with this. If fleshed out and automated, I
<br>
think your curriculum could become an important tool for AGI
<br>
development.
