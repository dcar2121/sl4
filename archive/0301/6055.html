<p>
I think the quality of discussion might be helped enormously if
<br>
there was a Wiki-like nonlinear forum in addition to a threaded
<br>
mailing list:
<br>
<p>1) Nodes for ubiquitous concepts like &quot;intelligence&quot; and
<br>
&quot;Singularity&quot; could short-circuit some of the definitional
<br>
debates that recur endlessly; you could just say, &quot;Well, I mean
<br>
'intelligence' in the 3rd sense listed, and if you look at that
<br>
part of the node, you'll see where the validity of that definition
<br>
has been debated before.&quot;
<br>
<p>2) There could be nodes for topics like &quot;CFAI 3.4.3.6&quot;, where
<br>
particular subsections of important documents can be discussed,
<br>
quizzed or critiqued. I'm watching the #sl4 chat right now, and
<br>
it's disheartening to see how often discussion ends &quot;Well, I'd
<br>
better go read LOGI/GISAI/... then.&quot; I think more people would
<br>
be encouraged to read those documents in detail if they had a
<br>
forum in which they could discuss them in detail. You can do
<br>
that on a mailing list, sure, but the multiplicity of topics
<br>
leads people to lose track, even with an archive. Simpler to
<br>
have the discussion take place in nonlinear Wiki-space to begin
<br>
with, and let people follow the associations as they need.
<br>
<p>3) It would permit a sort of segregated interaction between
<br>
technical topics like &quot;What Friendliness content needs to be
<br>
added by hand?&quot; and general-interest topics like &quot;This hard
<br>
take-off concept sounds a little scary!&quot; On a mailing list or
<br>
an IRC channel, when these discussions happen in parallel,
<br>
they sometimes trip each other up. In a Wiki-forum, the
<br>
technical nodes would point mainly to each other, the
<br>
general-interest nodes would point mainly to each other,
<br>
and when a person wants to cross over, they just follow the
<br>
link to the other part of topic-space.
<br>
<p>Things can go wrong, of course. I have no great experience
<br>
with nonlinear fora, but I'm sure there's whole new forms of
<br>
stupidity and inefficiency that thrive in such environments.
<br>
Nonetheless, it's an experiment I'd like to see happen.
