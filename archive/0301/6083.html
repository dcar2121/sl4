<p>Idiocy?  Sorta ;-)
<br>
<p>I'd call it the heavily-drug-induced hallucinations/speculations of a
<br>
brilliant, visionary freak, who rejected the scientific and empirical view
<br>
of reality and created a fascinating poetic truth that he sometimes
<br>
expressed in the language of science...
<br>
<p>I have read nearly all of Terence McKenna's published works.
<br>
<p>His book &quot;The Food of the Gods&quot; is an excellent history of the role of
<br>
psychoactive substances in the history of mankind.  In addition to a lot of
<br>
interesting historical facts, it contains the speculation that consciousness
<br>
developed in humans due to prehistoric interactions with psychedelic
<br>
mushrooms.
<br>
<p>&quot;True Hallucinations: Being an Account of the Author's Extraordinary
<br>
Adventures in the Devil's Paradise&quot; gives an account of his Amazonian
<br>
experiences with the hallucinogen ayahuasca, which led him to the 2012
<br>
prediction.  The date 2012 corresponds with the end of the Mayan calendar,
<br>
also.
<br>
<p>One of his other books --
<br>
<p>The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching
<br>
<p>contains some really interesting accounts of his conversations with
<br>
&quot;machine-elves from other dimensions&quot;, mediated via his daily experiences
<br>
with DMT (dimethyltryptamine), a substance that supposedly gives you an
<br>
LSD-like trip that comes and goes over a fifteen minute period.  (Very handy
<br>
for lunch hour, or even the morning coffee break !!)
<br>
<p>I never read
<br>
<p>&quot;Maya Cosmogenesis 2012: The True Meaning of the Maya Calendar End-Date&quot;
<br>
<p>but I gues it contains more on the silly 2012 prediction.
<br>
<p>For the last couple decades of his life he tended a large mushroom farm in
<br>
Hawaii
<br>
<p>To me, McKenna's thinking and writing is great science fiction -- he's a
<br>
dashing protagonist as well as an excellent storyteller.  Given his views
<br>
about the non-reality/surreality of our so-called &quot;reality&quot;, I don't think
<br>
he would have really  minded having his work labeled this way....
