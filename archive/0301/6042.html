<p>It's new years day 2003 and the weather is foul. Kids are asleep and I allow
<br>
myself the luxury of indulging myself in these emails...ahhhh....bliss....
<br>
Rafal delivers a ripe apple to munch on :-)
<br>
<p>Like you I keenly await resolution of the well from which subjective
<br>
experience springs. Here's a little help to tease it out....
<br>
<p>Imagine that inside our heads, intimately attached to and driven by the
<br>
neural/glial activity we observe, is an as yet unspecified emergent effect.
<br>
It 'is' the subjective feel, qualia, phenomenal consciousness (everyone's
<br>
got their name for it!). The cells are trained in form and behaviour to
<br>
express it as needed. Our learning is guided by the experience of it. We
<br>
have priveleged access to it conferred by our 1st person role and also
<br>
unspecified organisational details in the brain. Let's say it is based on
<br>
phenomenon X.
<br>
<p>Let's say we understand physical phenomenon X and set about creating
<br>
artificial neurons that not only algorithmically act in their traditional
<br>
macro-computational capacity but also provide a complete neuro-glial
<br>
substrate to allow allow artificial creation of emergent X to come along for
<br>
the ride. We craft our AGI substrate to make use of X. We know that any AGI
<br>
without X has a huge zombifying hole in the feedback mechanism driving
<br>
learning. No magic. No souls. Just good ol' brute physics at work leveraging
<br>
IQ out of a given amount of 'stuff'.
<br>
<p>Whatever X is, I think it does the job you want - proving we are not a
<br>
simulation. It creates the 'beables' - the algorithmic intermediates you
<br>
mention - that 'collapse' into the unified subjective experience of Mind.
<br>
Vision and feel and taste  and smell and sound all nicely propriocepted out
<br>
into the world.
<br>
<p>Indeed each layer of emergence adds to the evidence against simulation.
<br>
&quot;We get atoms from atomic particles&quot; and &quot;we get X from cellular behaviour&quot;
<br>
are equivalent statements. X is the top of the emergence heap and cells
<br>
don't know it's there. Atomic particles have no idea they are in atoms.
<br>
Subatomic particles have no idea they are in atomic particles. This is the
<br>
nature of the strata of emergence.
<br>
<p>X is really Occam's-razor-simple and obvious, there in front of us all the
<br>
time We're all going to go 'doh!', why didn't we see that before? Dennett is
<br>
going to go &quot;Told you so!!! Simple, easy, simple&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, the Nobel prize winning phenomenon X is....&lt;&lt; take a stab, and no
<br>
pinching Penrose/Hameroff stuff either :-) &gt;&gt;.
<br>
<p>Enjoy! Let's make 2003 the year we nail down qualia.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
