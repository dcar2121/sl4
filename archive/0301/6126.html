<p>
The most significant thing I got from Lanier's interview was that there
<br>
needs to be a paradigm shift in the way programmer's implement a solution to
<br>
a problem. Traditionally programming has been implementation according to a
<br>
specification that is eventually marshaled across a wire (serial line). In
<br>
OO terms, one object send a message to another object. Lanier is saying that
<br>
the specification that the common programmer relies on is a hindrance to
<br>
solutions and creativity. At least this is what I got out of it.
<br>
<p>A lot of the problems with &quot;enterprise level&quot; software I think is due to the
<br>
methodology and project management that is in use. I think that UML is a
<br>
great &quot;language&quot; simply of the fact that it is mostly pictorial and not
<br>
solely ASCII text based like all other programming languages one generally
<br>
talks about. The key assumption to make note of is that the programmers are
<br>
humans (as opposed to an AGI), who have bad hair days, nagging wives and
<br>
kids, the illusion of job security, and the whole gamut of the emotions that
<br>
humans experience that can both hinder and strengthen the software
<br>
development process. Therefore I submit that the problem of causing this
<br>
paradigm shift that Lanier is suggesting is a social engineering problem,
<br>
with the programmers themselves.
<br>
<p>Those of us in the industry should have heard of methodologies such as RUP,
<br>
and Agile Development methodologies which includes XP (eXtreme Programming).
<br>
Concepts such as constant unit testing, integration testing, pair
<br>
programming, code ownership, on-site customers, etc. I believe are all
<br>
addressed very well in XP at least. Different techniques would be used for
<br>
closed source versus open source, in-sourcing versus out-sourcing, teams
<br>
that work locally and globally, etc.
<br>
<p>There are many different tools and languages for modeling and programming
<br>
with. Procedural, object-oriented, component-oriented, service-oriented, and
<br>
phenotrophic computing that Lanier is suggesting. To most career
<br>
programmers, the difference between these concepts are not easily understood
<br>
and one often gets the glib reply of &quot;right tool for the right job,&quot; and
<br>
they continue to use the same old tools they have become familiar with
<br>
throughout their career. I guess the same applies to other holy wars such as
<br>
OS's, text editors, IDE's, etc.
<br>
<p>Now for an SL4 spin - imagine programming a system where you had or could
<br>
use all of your available motor reflexes other than typing through a
<br>
keyboard. This would include making sounds, pressing and moving things
<br>
around, etc. You would receive feedback of your program entry through all of
<br>
your available senses, including sight, sound, touch, smell, etc.
<br>
<p>Now imagine that computer you are trying to program is intelligent and
<br>
sentient. Maybe even a simulation of a biological human. Could you program
<br>
an already intelligent being? If the answer is yes, then you probably
<br>
realize that we are already doing it to the people around us every day.
<br>
Marketers and advertisers know this and are programming us constantly. If
<br>
your answer is no, well, I'm not sure what to think because I can't see how
<br>
any intelligent being could be so blind as to not see that we can all
<br>
program each other in one way or another, no matter how high an IQ one might
<br>
have.
<br>
