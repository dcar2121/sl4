Sorry for posting news on wtatalk, but I think this case is extremely
<br>
interesting, and reveals the bankruptcy of the human/non-human
<br>
distinction. I think the WTA should issue a statement saying that we
<br>
object to these odious distinctions. - J.

<p>Fans Howl in Protest as Judge Decides X-Men Aren't Human
<br>
<p>Marvel Fought to Have Characters Ruled
<br>
Nonhuman to Win Lower Tariff on Toys
<br>
<p>By NEIL KING JR. 
<br>
<p>Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
<br>
<p><p>Judge Judith Barzilay huddled late last year with a telepathic professor
<br>
and a cast of mutants to ponder an age-old question: What does it mean
<br>
to be human?
<br>
<p>In her chambers at the U.S. Court of International Trade, in New York,
<br>
the judge examined Prof. X and the rest of his band of X-Men, all of
<br>
them little plastic figures at the heart of a six-year tariff battle
<br>
between their owner, Marvel Enterprises Inc., and the U.S. Customs
<br>
Service.
<br>
<p>Her ruling thundered through the world of Marvel Comics fans. The famed
<br>
X-Men, those fighters of prejudice sworn to protect a world that hates
<br>
and fears them, are not human, she decreed Jan. 3. Nor are many of the
<br>
villains who do battle with Spiderman and the Fantastic Four. They're
<br>
all &quot;nonhuman creatures,&quot; concluded Judge Barzilay.
<br>
<p>Marvel subsidiary Toy Biz Inc. pushed Judge Barzilay to declare its
<br>
heroes nonhuman so it could win a lower duty rate on action figures
<br>
imported from China in the mid-1990s. At the time, tariffs put higher
<br>
duties on dolls than toys. According to the U.S. tariff code, human
<br>
figures are dolls, while figures representing animals or &quot;creatures,&quot;
<br>
such as monsters and robots, are deemed toys.
<br>
<p>To Brian Wilkinson, editor of the online site X-Fan
<br>
(x-mencomics.com/xfan/), Marvel's argument is appalling. The X-Men --
<br>
mere creatures? &quot;This is almost unthinkable,&quot; he says. &quot;Marvel's super
<br>
heroes are supposed to be as human as you or I. They live in New York.
<br>
They have families and go to work. And now they're no longer human?&quot;
<br>
<p><p>X-Men's Wolverine: Man or beast?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Chuck Austen, current author of Marvel's &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; comic-book
<br>
series, is also incredulous. He has worked hard for a year, he says, to
<br>
emphasize the X-Men's humanity, to show &quot;that they're just another
<br>
strand in the evolutionary chain.&quot;
<br>
<p>Marvel issued this statement: &quot;Don't fret, Marvel fans, our heroes are
<br>
living, breathing human beings -- but humans who have extraordinary
<br>
abilities ... . A decision that the X-Men figures indeed do have
<br>
'nonhuman' characteristics further proves our characters have special,
<br>
out-of-this world powers.&quot;
<br>
<p>The X-Men series broke new ground when it began in 1963 by confronting
<br>
racism and intolerance head-on. The good-hearted mutants rallied around
<br>
their mentor, the wheelchair-bound Prof. Charles Xavier, to protect
<br>
mankind, even as humans shunned and despised them.
<br>
<p>In 1996, Toy Biz sued Customs in the Court of International Trade, which
<br>
arbitrates foreign-trade disputes between U.S. companies and the
<br>
government. Toy Biz said its pantheon of action figures should be
<br>
classified as toys instead of dolls. Customs insisted the figures are
<br>
dolls, and thus subject to 12% import duties, instead of the 6.8% rate
<br>
for toys. Duties have since been eliminated from both categories.
<br>
<p>Thus began the great debate over the figures' true being. Barbie is a
<br>
doll. Pooh Bear's a toy. That much is easy.
<br>
<p>But what about Wolverine, the muscular X-Man with the metal claws that
<br>
jut out from his fists? Wolverine has known many forms in his more than
<br>
40 years as a Marvel character. In some comics, he resembles a
<br>
futuristic robot. In the movie &quot;X-Men,&quot; he's a scruffy Canadian who
<br>
drives a camper until falling under the protection of the telepathic
<br>
Prof. Xavier, dean of an academy for gifted mutants in suburban New
<br>
York.
<br>
<p>But is he human?
<br>
<p>To weigh that question, Judge Barzilay sat down with a sheaf of opposing
<br>
legal briefs and more than 60 action figures, including Wolverine,
<br>
Storm, Rogue and Bonebreaker.
<br>
<p>Toy Biz, in its filings, pulled no punches. The figures &quot;stand as potent
<br>
witnesses for their status as nonhuman creatures,&quot; the company argued.
<br>
How could they be humans, Toy Biz said, if they possessed &quot;tentacles,
<br>
claws, wings or robotic limbs?&quot;
<br>
<p>Toy Biz had good cause to pursue this line. Having its action figures
<br>
declared toys would mean a hefty reimbursement of past duties, though
<br>
the company declines to give specifics on how much was at stake.
<br>
<p>The U.S. government showed more feeling. Each figure had a &quot;distinctive
<br>
individual personality,&quot; the federal legal team argued. Some were
<br>
Russians, Japanese, black, white, women, even handicapped. Wolverine,
<br>
the government insisted, was simply &quot;a man with prosthetic hands.&quot;
<br>
Justice Department lawyers who handled the case didn't return calls
<br>
seeking comment.
<br>
<p>Judge Barzilay, through a spokesman, said that she would let her 32-page
<br>
decision speak for itself. But she described in her ruling how she
<br>
subjected many of the figures to &quot;comprehensive examinations.&quot; At times,
<br>
that included &quot;the need to remove the clothes of the figure.&quot;
<br>
<p>The X-Men, oddly, gave her the least trouble. They are mutants, she
<br>
declared, who &quot;use their extraordinary and unnatural ... powers on the
<br>
side of good or evil.&quot; The judge observed how the character Storm, with
<br>
her flowing white hair and dark skin, &quot;can summon storms at will,&quot; while
<br>
Pyro has a &quot;mutant ability to control and shape flames.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thus the X-Men are &quot;something other than human.&quot; Case closed.
<br>
<p>Tougher for the judge were figures from the Fantastic Four and Spiderman
<br>
series. Judge Barzilay wrestled at length with Kraven, a famed hunter
<br>
who once vanquished Spiderman, thanks in part to the strength gained
<br>
from drinking secret jungle elixirs.
<br>
<p>The judge found that Kraven exhibited &quot;highly exaggerated muscle tone in
<br>
arms and legs.&quot; He wore a &quot;lion's mane-like vest.&quot; Both features helped
<br>
relegate him, in the judge's mind, to the netherworld of robots,
<br>
monsters and devils.
<br>
<p>Judge Barzilay conceded that the closest call was the Mole Man, who once
<br>
blinded the Fantastic Four with searing beams of light. The judge found
<br>
him to be &quot;stout and thick,&quot; with &quot;exaggerated troll-like features&quot; and
<br>
very pale skin -- fitting for someone who lives underground. Given all
<br>
that, Judge Barzilay concluded, the Mole Man was more mole than man.
<br>
<p>Veteran comics fan Christian Cooper, who once worked as a Marvel editor,
<br>
thinks Judge Barzilay got carried away. If Kraven isn't human, what
<br>
about the twisted villains in Dick Tracy? Or worse yet, Superman
<br>
himself?
<br>
<p>&quot;Here's a guy who changes his clothes in a phone booth and flies through
<br>
the air,&quot; says Mr. Cooper. &quot;Does that mean he's now an animal?&quot;

<p>&quot;Who ever thought that this particular model 
<br>
of the body is forever? A little, mammalian, 
<br>
furry body, it forever? Sometimes I notice 
<br>
my body. It has little fur, little fangs, 
<br>
ears still slightly pointed. We are 
<br>
spiritual beings still in animal bodies and 
<br>
it always struck me as weird.&quot;
