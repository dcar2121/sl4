</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with this, and I suspect most folks on this list do not...
<br>
<p>I do agree that there is a lot we don't understand about consciousness &amp; its
<br>
connection to physical reality.
<br>
<p>However, I am not at all sure that we need to fully understand the nature of
<br>
consciousness, in order to create an AGI.
<br>
<p>Similarly, we don't need to fully understand the nature of energy to create
<br>
an engine.  And we don't need to fully understand the nature and origin of
<br>
life to create an artificial organism (a project Craig Venter and his team
<br>
are now working on).
<br>
<p>In another decade, you and I may be chatting on this list with an AGI
<br>
system, mutually pondering the mysterious and beautiful nature of the
<br>
awareness we all share...
<br>
<p>Having said that, I do have my own speculations regarding consciousness,
<br>
which I'll briefly share.  I stress that these speculations are only loosely
<br>
related to my own practical AGI work.
<br>
<p>Firstly: As for the &quot;X-factor&quot; underlying consciousness, my money is on
<br>
randomness, which I believe must be considered subjectively -- &quot;randomness
<br>
with respect to a particular observer.&quot;  [Roughly speaking, X is random with
<br>
respect to observer O if O cannot produce a better program for computing X
<br>
than &quot;list the components of X&quot;.  This has been extensively formalized in
<br>
algorithmic information theory.]
<br>
<p>More specifically...
<br>
<p>The mind of a physical system is a fuzzy set whose elements are drawn from
<br>
the set of patterns in that system.  The set of patterns in the system form
<br>
an &quot;emergent dynamical system&quot; related to, but different from, the dynamical
<br>
system of the physical system itself.
<br>
<p>The dynamics of the mind-system associated with a physical system, may be to
<br>
some extent unpredictable (i.e. random) with respect to *the mind-system
<br>
itself*.  This leads toward the phenomenon of consciousness.
<br>
<p>The *intensity* of consciousness has to do with the rate of flux between the
<br>
random and ordered realms, occurring in a mind-system.  The emergence of
<br>
patterns in portions of the mind-system that were previously opaque to the
<br>
mind-system, and the decent into opacity of portions of the mind-system that
<br>
were previously patterned (in the mind-systems's own perspective).
<br>
<p>This is yet another one of those interesting lines of thought that I've put
<br>
on the back-burner for a while, focusing instead on revising the in-process
<br>
Novamente book, and on Novamente-based product engineering...
<br>
<p>But if this line of thinking is at all on-target, then consciousness is a
<br>
systemic, emergent phenomenon, not tied to any particular physical
<br>
phenomenon.
<br>
<p>In fact, I suspect that a correct understanding of consciousness as a
<br>
systemic, emergent phenomenon *may* be helpful in our understanding of the
<br>
physical universe -- the quantum theory of measurement, Grand Unified Field
<br>
Theory, etc. etc.  Rather than looking to physics to save cognitive
<br>
psychology and AGI, I'm more inclined to look to cog psych and AGI to save
<br>
physics ;-)
