<em>&gt; So - there are five levels: code, modality, concept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought, deliberation. What I'm going to do is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informally sketch something which *sounds to me* like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has all those levels.
</em><br>
<p>But do we really know how do minds work or we are going to just code
<br>
whatever we know
<br>
and hope that whatever we'll create turns out to be a mind?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Code - no problem here, every program is made of code.
</em><br>
<p>Does any mind use code? It seems to me that the main purpose of code is to
<br>
keep a record of the structure so the AI will have the access to that code
<br>
once it knows how to manipulate it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Modality - Above all, a modality seems to be a *feature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extractor*, operating in a specific domain. The input is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sort of raw data set, static or dynamic, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; output is a representation as a list of features, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objects with features. Well, neural nets can do all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Concept, thought, deliberation - In LOGI, these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described as analogous to word, sentence, stream of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness. So it seems that *propositional content*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think Prolog) might be enough for those top two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels -
</em><br>
<p>Okay, but what is the nature of concepts? What will be the &quot;code&quot; of a
<br>
concept. They will not be run through traditional compilers, I assume, are
<br>
they?
<br>
<p>Next, what is the nature of the &quot;computation&quot; that might be performed on
<br>
those concepts? How should interaction between concepts look like? If you
<br>
load &quot;lightbulb&quot; and &quot;triangle&quot; and want to create &quot;triangular lightbulb&quot;
<br>
inside the mental workspace, what will need to happen between the two chunks
<br>
of code, and more importantly, how will it contribute to intelligence of the
<br>
mind? In other words, how would we know that implementing concepts and
<br>
mental
<br>
workspace creates an intelligent system rather than sophisticated
<br>
representational system.
<br>
<p>And what mechanisms might govern reasoning with the structures made of
<br>
concepts?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;'sentences' in some internal language of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation. The AI needs to produce descriptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentences which express what its modalities tell it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and normative sentences which express its intentions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you can get those, there is a wealth of symbolic AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work on putting them to use in a rational fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, the key concept seems to be 'concept', and the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it bridges the gap between subsymbolic feature extraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and symbolic-level propositional processing. Well, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple way to do that is to have concepts which are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lists of features.
</em><br>
<p>If the concept is proposed to be a list of features, then how would those
<br>
features interact with other features to produce something meaningful?
<br>
Wouldn't a mere list of features lack the &quot;substance&quot; that all
<br>
conceps/symbols necessarily require?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Each modality outputs an inventory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of features possessed by its current input; the art of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate concept formation is all about picking out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a few of those features as 'co-relevant', worthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being grouped together. And Copycat provides a model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for *that* process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It looks to me like we already have all the ingredients,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not for a seed AI, but certainly for a &quot;general AI&quot; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defined by LOGI.
</em><br>
<p>I think we have a good direction, but lack the means of reaching the
<br>
destination.
