Dear SL4,
<br>
<p>Ben wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, it's true that Michael's tests do not explicitly seek to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguish learning from metalearning etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Correct.  Learning new methods of learning is quite an advanced topic
<br>
from a &quot;external game playing&quot; POV.  But IMO, any AGI worth its salt is
<br>
going to have internal mechanisms of doing this right from the start...
<br>
else it is not going to get very far.  Learning about new ways of
<br>
learning is no different from any other kind of learning.  It is the
<br>
using of that information to modify cognition that is the trick.  I
<br>
imagine it will entail a combination of heuristics, random guessing,
<br>
pattern recognition on stored experience, analogizing, etc... but that
<br>
is a discussion for another time (after I see how Eliezer fleshes-out
<br>
LOGI ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a system is able to &quot;learn how to learn&quot;, then it should be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to carry over learning from one test to the next in the test suite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yeppers.  And that is one of the main purposes of the Curriculum: to
<br>
provide a base of experience in simple domains, to enable
<br>
quicker/faster/cheaper learning in more complex domains.  I really have
<br>
a lot more game ideas, just haven't had the time to write them into the
<br>
doc yet ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One could construct a similar regime to test learning how to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to learn, though it would be a lot more elaborate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time-consuming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The basis of this is already laid out in the lesson on 'Understanding
<br>
Symbols' and the lesson on 'Algorithmic Fundamentals'.  Once the AGI has
<br>
learned how to 'follow instructions' i.e. algorithms, and learned how to
<br>
associate symbols with objects, then you could tell ver an algorithm,
<br>
assign a symbol for the algorithm, then provide that symbol along with
<br>
another question.  The symbol would be the hint: &quot;here's a way to solve
<br>
the problem&quot;.  The &quot;problem&quot; could itself be a way to solve a problem.
<br>
<p>Of course all of my games would be utterly pointless if the candidate
<br>
AGI &quot;don't got what it takes&quot; to generalize the given algorithm, or
<br>
'draw an analogy' from it to apply to a new situation.   My Curriculum
<br>
is *about* providing simple opportunities to do that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem with making a test suite for an embodied AI, is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test suite is inevitably very body-dependent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  I'm not sure I agree with this.  I agree that an *interface* has
<br>
to be tailored to each embodiment.  I don't agree that the basic lessons
<br>
would change.  For example: Feeding a string of binary data to a human
<br>
is going to result in difficulty and confusion.  Providing the same
<br>
information as visual characters and words will lead to better uptake.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed, if the &quot;embodiment is necessary for AI&quot; theory is correct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't think embodiment is necessary for AGI.  But I do think that
<br>
real-world input will make symbol-grounding (of the type humans do)
<br>
easier.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not think Michael's tests are anywhere near adequate as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training regime for a baby AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It depends on the design... but I get your point.  Many AGI design types
<br>
will require a large quantity of experiential learning.  I have not
<br>
attempted to describe that because different designs will require
<br>
different lessons and learning situations.  Instead the Curriculum
<br>
focuses on what might be called 'book learning'.  Lessons that every AGI
<br>
is going to have to learn in order to make progress.  I will make this
<br>
clearer in my next version.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I think that tests like Michael's can serve as an important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; component of a baby AI training regimen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the encouragement :D
<br>
