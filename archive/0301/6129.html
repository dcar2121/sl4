As I see it, SIAI's strategy for directly producing a
<br>
Friendly Singularity (and not just increasing its likelihood
<br>
through Friendliness evangelism) requires two steps:
<br>
<p>1. Learn to make LOGI-like AIs (AIs with the five-level
<br>
structure outlined in &quot;Levels of General Intelligence&quot;).
<br>
<p>2. Equip one such AI with the skill set and value system
<br>
needed to be a Friendly seed AI.
<br>
<p>Now, just how hard is step 1? Or, to put it differently,
<br>
what's the simplest program of which Eliezer might say,
<br>
&quot;Yup, that's an example of what I was talking about&quot;?
<br>
<p>I think we are in dire need of such didactic prototypes
<br>
if there is ever to be a *coding community* working on
<br>
this thing. There has to be a common understanding of
<br>
the basic concepts, and I'm not convinced that that exists
<br>
yet.
<br>
<p>So - there are five levels: code, modality, concept,
<br>
thought, deliberation. What I'm going to do is just
<br>
informally sketch something which *sounds to me* like
<br>
it has all those levels.
<br>
<p>Code - no problem here, every program is made of code.
<br>
<p>Modality - Above all, a modality seems to be a *feature
<br>
extractor*, operating in a specific domain. The input is
<br>
some sort of raw data set, static or dynamic, and the
<br>
output is a representation as a list of features, or
<br>
objects with features. Well, neural nets can do all of
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Concept, thought, deliberation - In LOGI, these are
<br>
described as analogous to word, sentence, stream of
<br>
consciousness. So it seems that *propositional content*
<br>
(think Prolog) might be enough for those top two
<br>
levels - 'sentences' in some internal language of
<br>
representation. The AI needs to produce descriptive
<br>
sentences which express what its modalities tell it,
<br>
and normative sentences which express its intentions.
<br>
If you can get those, there is a wealth of symbolic AI
<br>
work on putting them to use in a rational fashion.
<br>
<p>So, the key concept seems to be 'concept', and the way
<br>
it bridges the gap between subsymbolic feature extraction
<br>
and symbolic-level propositional processing. Well, one
<br>
simple way to do that is to have concepts which are just
<br>
lists of features. Each modality outputs an inventory
<br>
of features possessed by its current input; the art of
<br>
appropriate concept formation is all about picking out
<br>
just a few of those features as 'co-relevant', worthy
<br>
of being grouped together. And Copycat provides a model
<br>
for *that* process.
<br>
<p>It looks to me like we already have all the ingredients,
<br>
not for a seed AI, but certainly for a &quot;general AI&quot; as
<br>
defined by LOGI.
