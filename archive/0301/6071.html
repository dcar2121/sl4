Late to this thread but it looks interesting enough.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is it that you want?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>First, to know what exactly it is that I want even if I could 
<br>
have everything I can imagine.  Eash think that I can think of 
<br>
doesn't seem to be &quot;it&quot; by the time I have conceived of it.  I 
<br>
would like to know what it is that drives me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is it that you are trying to accomplish with all these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological tricks and toys?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whatever it is you're really wishing for, you can be sure that the kind 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of gadgetry dreamed up by human science fiction writers - even the very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best science fiction writers like Greg Egan - is not the best way to go 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about it.  We notice our technology because it's clumsy.  Because the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology is so awkward that it is visible, and has visible side 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects, and imposes visible constraints on what can be accomplished by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Nanotechnology and utility fog may be able to build a flying carpet; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current technology leaves us with airplanes; an upload just is where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want to be.  To a medieval scholar the only understandable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between nanotechnology and femtotechnology is that one can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn lead into gold, and the other can't; and there's no distinction at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all between femtotechnology and chromotechnology because the medieval 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scholar doesn't know enough to invent a task that chromotechnology can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perform but femtotechnology can't.  Sufficiently advanced technology is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *very* distinguishable from magic.  Magic is just as awkward as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insufficiently advanced technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>One of the best visions of what could be that goes beyond a bit 
<br>
of the &quot;gadget stage&quot; that I have encountred lately is in John C 
<br>
Wright's &quot;The Golden Age&quot;.  Of course I am not far into it. 
<br>
I'll see if it holds up.  I am not sure it really touches &quot;why?&quot;
<br>
<p>Many of us &quot;techies&quot; are seriously driven to make the tech less 
<br>
and less clunky, too push the envelop towards seamlessness then 
<br>
push again when that is no longer seamless enough.  Why?  That I 
<br>
am not sure of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And so we have the odd concept of cyborgs.  Of neural links to computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems.  Of humanoid robot bodies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>All good advances from now but not ends.  Steps along the way. 
<br>
Means. Temporary make-shifts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The future will not be science fiction because it will have no buttons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to press.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Quite a bit of sci-fi has no buttons or at least not so obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And faced with that possibility, people tend to panic, and fall back on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comforting habits learned from the cozy books of childhood.  It can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dizzying to confront the question &quot;But what, exactly, do you actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want?&quot; once the crutch of wishing for gadgetry is stripped away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  But it is the honest question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But let's ask anyway.  Forget about the toys.  What is it that you want?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forget about the technology.  What are the patterns in reality that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are trying to alter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The pattern of yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are not your body.  But you can't see the inside of your mind.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't see the kind of improvements that are really worthwhile.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't imagine changing yourself, so you imagine changing your body instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, I can imagine quite drastic changes of 
<br>
&quot;myself&quot;. Changing the body is a poor substitute, an aid at best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the first thing that changes will be your ability to understand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change, and the changes you want to make.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I would hope so but I am not yet convinced it will be so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The SF plots that have been posted to this thread don't look to me like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes at all, just running in the same place, because they don't alter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of the things I have learned to see as important.  It seems like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; displacement activities for deeper wishes that are harder to verbalize.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Has anyone here said &quot;I wish to be happy&quot;, or &quot;I wish that it didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take so much effort just to exist&quot;, or &quot;I wish I understood reality and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my place in it&quot;, in among the dreams of cloning and robot bodies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I wish for the latter and that I understood what is possible for 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;me/us to be and what difference it makes.  I wish to 
<br>
understand what calls me and seemingly will never let me find 
<br>
any lesser place of rest.  Perhaps I have some bug that will 
<br>
never let me rest content ever.  It remains to be seen.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't know if what matters is the journey or the destination.  I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know if the philosophy of the trip is to stop and smell the flowers, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race for the light as fast as possible.  In the first case, I might have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some small idea of who I'll be immediately afterward, though I consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it unhealthy to spend too much time thinking about it.  In the second 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, I think little or nothing can be said at all.  To spend too much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time thinking about slow paths is to forget that you don't know whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the path will be fast or slow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Another way of saying you don't know what the end is or if 
<br>
there ever can be one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People contemplating the slow path lose their objectivity and begin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spinning fantasy scenarios in which the entire course of technological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress ends up stretched over a thousand years or whatever.  If humans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up walking down the slow path, and smelling the flowers, it will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because some Friendly AI blazed a trail all the way to the end, just to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sure that there are no dangers that slowly blossoming humans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't see.  
</em><br>
<p>I do not agree this is the only way this could happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No gamma-ray bursts, exploding galaxies, decaying laws of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, hostile superintelligences, what-have-you.  Even if the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest amount of fun comes from stopping to smell the flowers, there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has to be at least one sentience who sacrifices leisure and burns for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the light as fast as possible. 
</em><br>
<p>This does not follow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Otherwise we might end up prey for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything that we weren't smart enough to know about.  
</em><br>
<p>Or not.  Sheer dumb luck has apparently got us this far. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we end up doing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this the slow way, it'll be because whichever sentience blazed the trail 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a Friendly seed AI or its heir, I expect) comes back and says:  &quot;It's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safe, and desirable, to stop and smell the flowers.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To summarize the parts of this that I consider it polite to talk about:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What are the impolite portions like?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 1)  We don't know whether it's the journey or the destination;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Even if it is the journey that counts, and not the destination, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect at least one sentient mind will blaze a trail for the rest;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  And as a result of that superintelligence being around, anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making a slow journey will do so without any visible gadgetry, because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only clumsy technology is visible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>How does (3) follow?  To be slow doesn't the tech have to be 
<br>
relatively clumsy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if you're thinking that what you want involves chrome and steel, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lasers and shiny buttons to press, neural interfaces, nanotechnology, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever great groaning steam engine has a place in your heart, you need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to stop writing a science fiction novel with yourself as the main 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character, and ask yourself who you want to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I think it includes many of these things - until it doesn't need 
<br>
to. But the question of who/what we want to be is of course 
<br>
extremely important.  All the tech and magic of whatever 
<br>
sophistication will not mean a lot without facing that.
