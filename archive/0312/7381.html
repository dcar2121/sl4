Mike Deering, on the AGI list, asked me for a report on the progress of the
<br>
Novamente AI project
<br>
<p>I thought this might be of interest to some fraction of the SL4 list as
<br>
well, so here it is.
<br>
<p>For those who aren't SL4 old-timers: Novamente (www.agiri.org) is an AI
<br>
project that's been in progress since mid-2001, with Singularitarian
<br>
ambitions, and also with short-term commercial applications in
<br>
bioinformatics and other areas.
<br>
<p>-- Ben Goertzel
<br>
<p><p>-----------------
<br>
Hi Mike,
<br>
<p>About Novamente project progress...
<br>
<p>The reason I haven't given progress updates to this list lately is that I've
<br>
been even more insanely busy than usual, due to a combination of AI work and
<br>
(Novamente-related) business work and personal-life developments.  So
<br>
recreational emailing has fallen by the wayside of late.  Now that Christmas
<br>
vacation has come, I have a little time send emails!  [Although I'm going on
<br>
vacation for 4 days starting tomorrow, so I'll be offline for a little
<br>
while....]
<br>
<p>Progress on Novamente has actually stepped up considerably as of September,
<br>
when a few new people were brought into the project (in connection with a
<br>
commercial application of Novamente), some of them working on language
<br>
processing and one working on more fundamental AI stuff (representation of
<br>
complex knowledge; and evolutionary learning).
<br>
<p>However, our recent progress has been of a technical nature, it hasn't yet
<br>
yielded big milestones that are exciting to report the world at large.
<br>
<p>Regarding language processing, we have a system that &quot;reads&quot; English text
<br>
and outputs semantic relationships contained in the text into Novamente.
<br>
This is one way to fill the system's mind up with information, though from
<br>
an AGI perspective it must be considered a complement to experiential
<br>
interactive learning, rather than as the sole means of providing the system
<br>
with knowledge.  However, this &quot;relationship extraction&quot; software is far
<br>
from complete; there's probably 6 months of work left on the &quot;syntax&quot; side,
<br>
which will proceed in parallel with work on the semantic interpretation of
<br>
the extracted relationships.
<br>
<p>Regarding reasoning, we've made a lot of progress on probabilistic
<br>
inference, in the context of experimenting with inference on biological data
<br>
(quantitative experimental data and data from relational DB's), and (more
<br>
recently) on linguistic knowledge.  This has involved a lot of technical
<br>
math work on my part, working out various details in the inference system.
<br>
The results here are very interesting, although there's a lot more testing
<br>
and tweaking required, particularly regarding the control of inference.
<br>
<p>We've got the code in place for our own generalization of combinatory logic,
<br>
which is the scheme we're using to represent complex knowledge in Novamente
<br>
(the knowledge that would be represented using variables and quantifiers in
<br>
a traditional logic-based system).  And we've generalized the Bayesian
<br>
Optimization Algorithm (an extension of genetic algorithms based on
<br>
probability theory, invented by Martin Pelikan and David Goldberg) to learn
<br>
complex combinatory logic expressions.   Experimentation with this is
<br>
ongoing actively, and during the first half of 2004 this code will be
<br>
integrated with the probabilistic reasoning code.  I spent a lot of time
<br>
last month working out the nasty software-design details of integrating
<br>
inferential processing with combinatory logic; that design will be
<br>
implemented in January.
<br>
<p>I redesigned our previous &quot;attention allocation&quot; subsystem, which used to
<br>
use neural net based ideas, to use a different approach based on
<br>
probabilistic inference, thus simplifying the system and (I hope) inducing
<br>
more emergence among components.  This hasn't been implemented yet though.
<br>
<p>Yes, we STILL are not at the phase where we've hooked up Novamente to a
<br>
&quot;simulated body&quot; in a simulated world and started teaching it
<br>
experientially.  We're very much looking forward to that day!  As of this
<br>
point, I can at least say there are no major components that are
<br>
unengineered ... the coding of the generalized-combinatory-logic framework w
<br>
as the biggest beast AI-wise.  However, there's a lot of integration,
<br>
testing and tuning work ahead, and some moderate-sized beasts remain uncoded
<br>
(like probabilistic attention allocation, and probabilistic logical
<br>
unification).  Also, there is some nitty-gritty work as yet undone, such as
<br>
extending the Novamente core to run on multiple machines as a distributed
<br>
system (the design was made to support extension to distributed processing,
<br>
but the work hasn't been done yet).  And, we've ordered our first 64-bit
<br>
machine, and in early 2004 will undertake the task of porting the core to
<br>
64-bit Linux on 64-bit hardware....  Depending on how much attention we can
<br>
give to AGI as opposed to commercial Novamente applications, we could get to
<br>
the &quot;teaching the baby&quot; phase in mid or late 2004, or it might not be till
<br>
2005.
<br>
<p>Next, some comments on funding.
<br>
<p>Our strategy of funding AGI work via commercial applications of the
<br>
in-progress AI system is working, in the sense that we're making progress
<br>
implementing and testing the AI system, while getting paid for it at a
<br>
reasonable level.  Some of the commercial applications are also very
<br>
interesting in themselves; for instance, in our bioinformatics work we've
<br>
made some real progress in creating original diagnostic tools for a couple
<br>
diseases (publications on this will come out in early 2004; in one case we
<br>
found a diagnostic using Novamente, and in another case using a simpler,
<br>
more specialized software system whose construction was inspired by parts of
<br>
Novamente).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, there's no doubt that if we had some funding purely
<br>
oriented toward AGI research, we'd be progressing significantly faster.  It
<br>
wouldn't take too much either.   Funding on the order of $10,000/month would
<br>
enable us to hire 3 programmer/scientists exclusively oriented toward AGI
<br>
rather than commercial applications, which would drastically accelerate our
<br>
progress, as opposed to the current situation where nearly everyone's time
<br>
is either devoted to commercial apps, or fragmented between commercial apps
<br>
and AGI.
<br>
<p>However, I'm not complaining (though I complained a lot yesterday after an
<br>
entire day spent conferring with intellectual property lawyers! ;p) -- I'm
<br>
happy that it's proved possible to continue the AGI work in an economically
<br>
sustainable way.
<br>
<p>Regarding the long-delayed &quot;Novamente book&quot;, it got too big and messy and so
<br>
it was trifurcated into three books
<br>
<p>* Probablistic Term Logic (an in-depth treatment of this one component of
<br>
Novamente, which is the most mathematically involved component)
<br>
* Novamente: Design for an Artificial General Intelligence
<br>
* Mind Patterns (a semi-technical review of the conceptual foundations of
<br>
Novamente)
<br>
<p>I haven't had much time for writing lately, but the PTL manuscript is
<br>
largely done, awaiting only some proofreading and a couple final chapters
<br>
covering practical applications, to be added in early '04.   Now that
<br>
Christmas vacation is here and the business world is in a lull, I've been
<br>
digging into the main &quot;Novamente Design&quot; manuscript again, and am happily
<br>
updating it in accordance with recent simplifications and improvements in
<br>
the design.  It seems likely that, even with everything else on my plate,
<br>
I'll manage to get these manuscripts submitted for publication in 2004,
<br>
hopefully by early fall.  Once these books are published, we'll probably
<br>
make a big push to get some pure-AGI funding to accelerate progress.  Unless
<br>
we've made soooo much progress by then (due to my delays in finishing the
<br>
books!) that more funding isn't needed ;-)
<br>
<p>And that's the capsule summary regarding Novamente.  Could be better ... but
<br>
could also be a lot worse.  I've never been more confident of the capability
<br>
of the Novamente design to yield AGI, but I've also become more acutely
<br>
aware of the time and effort taken to tune and tweak and refine the various
<br>
parts of the design to really work as intended.  The commercial work we're
<br>
doing can be frustrating in that it distracts from pure AGI work, but it has
<br>
its rewards in itself (intellectual and human rewards as well as paying the
<br>
bills), and it also provides excellent contexts in which to test, tune and
<br>
refine various system components as they develop.
