Perry:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure you completely got the implications of Tegmark's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paper. His straightforward calculations make it seem extraordinarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unlikely that one could do quantum computation in a brain at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological temperatures. That, coupled with the fact that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actual evidence in favor of the quantum hypothesis at all (other than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pure speculation) tends to lead one to disbelieve in it very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;powerfully.
</em><br>
<p>Tegmark's calculations address rather artificial situations like:
<br>
an ion is on the inside and the outside of a membrane,
<br>
another ion passes by, and the first ion's superposition is
<br>
decohered. So Tegmark certainly showed up a flaw in the
<br>
models he criticised, which did blithely talk about that sort
<br>
of superposition, without regard for the effects of
<br>
environmental decoherence. But if there is significant
<br>
quantum coherence in living matter, it's probably due to
<br>
collective, cooperative effects, akin to Bose condensation.
<br>
One old favorite in the quantum-mind literature is a Bose-like
<br>
condensation of phonons which should occur at high
<br>
temperatures (&quot;Frohlich coherence&quot;). Then there's more
<br>
recent work on quantum phase transitions in periodic
<br>
structures; under the right conditions, the &quot;correlation
<br>
length&quot; - the scale on which quantum correlations are
<br>
exhibited - can go to infinity. One might imagine that this
<br>
can happen to the electrons in a periodic structure like a
<br>
microtubule. And so on. There's a whole class of models
<br>
still waiting to be investigated.
<br>
<p>Why take this possibility seriously? Two reasons. First,
<br>
quantum mechanics is the basic theory, and we have yet
<br>
to investigate the dynamics of entanglement in everyday
<br>
substances. I have never seen a decoherence calculation
<br>
even for something as simple as diamond. Presumably
<br>
there's a temperature-dependent finite scale on which
<br>
entanglement (between the bonding electrons, say)
<br>
might be exhibited. Probably it's negligible at anything
<br>
above absolute zero. But until someone figures out how
<br>
to do the calculation, it's hard to say for sure. And that
<br>
goes double for biological matter.
<br>
<p>The second reason is philosophical, or phenomenological.
<br>
If you think that identifying states of consciousness with
<br>
coarse-grained mesoscopic properties of an ensemble of
<br>
decoherent microscopic systems (and that's how I would
<br>
physically characterize the states of orthodox computational
<br>
neuroscience) is a-priori implausible, then you'll be
<br>
motivated to consider the alternatives. But that's a fuzzy
<br>
judgment call over which people disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;That is not the way the word is usually used. Or, at least, &quot;reality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that metaphysics deals with has to do with issues like existence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ontology, epistemology etc. It has nothing to do with physics per se.
</em><br>
<p>The ontology of physics is a highly disputed thing - see the
<br>
difference between Newton, Kant, Mach, and the later Einstein
<br>
on the nature of space, or the war of all against all in the
<br>
interpretation of quantum theory. So if even the physics of
<br>
mind is not what we think it is, the metaphysics is hardly
<br>
going to stay put.
