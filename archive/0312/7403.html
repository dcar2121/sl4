</em><br>
<em> &gt; description that is unassailable, the description that gives to those who
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why would *any* description, even a correct one, even a knowably correct
<br>
one, give those who hold it any kind of binding authority over anyone?
<br>
This sounds like a strawman argument to me.
<br>
<p>I acknowledge that a final reality exists.  I don't claim to have a
<br>
perfect description of it.  I've written extensively about exactly that
<br>
critical distinction, as some of the people on this list may recall.
<br>
<p>What I want is to keep mental track, at all times, between the distinction
<br>
between the map and the territory; and I don't think you're doing that.
<br>
It was the territory of aerodynamics, not anyone's map of aerodynamics,
<br>
that determined that the Wright Brothers' plane would actually fly.  Just
<br>
because our knowledge of aerodynamics is, and forever will be, a map,
<br>
doesn't mean that it wasn't the territory of aerodynamics that lifted the
<br>
plane.
<br>
<p>Yes, when I talk about the &quot;territory of aerodynamics&quot;, this statement is
<br>
itself a map; so is my statement that, e.g., &quot;contrary to a widespread
<br>
misapprehension, lift by airplane wings is *not* generated by the
<br>
Bernoulli Principle&quot;.  Maps, by default, are about the territory.  If, on
<br>
the other hand, you want to talk *about* a map, you need a metamap that
<br>
treats the first map as a territory.  This is a difficult distinction to
<br>
keep track of; you can find some discussion of it in the section on
<br>
external reference semantics in _Creating Friendly AI_.
<br>
<p>When I talk about the Singularity, I am using a simple map in which I talk
<br>
about recursive self-improvement as opposed to evolution, indefinitely
<br>
extensible hardware as opposed to hardware-bounded brains, and so on.
<br>
You, on the other hand, complain about the map of the Singularity having a
<br>
supposed similarity to the map of religion.  In so doing, you are using a
<br>
metamap, a map of a map, and you are failing to track that distinction.
<br>
You seem to think that your arguments about supposed resemblances between
<br>
the Singularity map and the religious map (metamap) can be mentioned in
<br>
the same breath as arguments about improvement rates and development
<br>
trajectories in recursively self-modifying AIs (simple map).
<br>
<p>Some of us are interested in a special property that maps sometimes have;
<br>
this property is correspondence to the territory.  We have no direct
<br>
access to the territory; if we did, we could determine the correspondence
<br>
by direct comparison.  But we still know the abstract fact that the
<br>
territory exists, and the abstract fact that the correspondence between
<br>
any given map and territory will be imperfect.  The imperfections where a
<br>
map fails to match the territory, for obvious reasons, are never part of
<br>
the map itself; but the abstract fact that imperfections probably exist
<br>
can be part of the map.  From this abstract knowledge comes the idea of
<br>
improving a map so that it corresponds more closely to the territory.
<br>
<p>Working with the abstract knowledge that the map and the territory differ,
<br>
it is possible to try and figure out rules to follow for bringing the map
<br>
into closer correspondence with the territory.  One such set of rules is
<br>
called science.
<br>
<p>The reason why scientists have power, why humans have walked on the moon,
<br>
why witch doctors are less effective than surgeons, why a digital watch
<br>
works whether we believe in it or not, is that the scientific map has a
<br>
better correspondence to the territory.  Does this consist of the
<br>
scientific map containing the metamap statement, &quot;this map corresponds
<br>
more closely to the territory&quot;?  No, of course not.  Any map might contain
<br>
that statement.  The correspondence between map and territory is not a
<br>
part of the map.  It is a part of the territory.  Like the rest of the
<br>
territory, this correspondence is not directly accessible; we can make
<br>
maps of the correspondence but they're just maps.  But it is nonetheless
<br>
this real correspondence that determines whether a theory works, just as
<br>
it is the territory of aerodynamics and not anyone's map of it that keeps
<br>
a 747 in the air.
<br>
<p>Sometimes theories *really are* correct, even though they may not be
<br>
*knowably* correct - the correspondence is a part of the territory, and
<br>
independent of any maps which may be made of that correspondence, which is
<br>
why a digital watch works whether you believe in it or not.  Our abstract
<br>
knowledge that sometimes theories really are correct is what explains our
<br>
observation that sometimes theories actually work.  This is in no way
<br>
contradicted by our abstract knowledge that even theories which really are
<br>
correct will not be *knowably* correct.  That a theory is sometimes
<br>
actually correct is one abstract fact about the territory and the mapping
<br>
process; that even a really correct theory is still not *knowably* correct
<br>
is a *separate* abstract fact about the mapping process.
<br>
<p>My confidence that 2 + 2 = 4 may be 99% rather than 100%, but this doesn't
<br>
mean that 2 + 2 = 4 only 99 out of 100 times.  That *I* am uncertain does
<br>
not mean *reality* is uncertain.  It is a self-consistent account of the
<br>
history of our universe to describe it as starting with the eternally
<br>
absolutely correct unalterable fact that 2 + 2 = 4, and going from there
<br>
to the eventual physical development of a piece of matter called Eliezer
<br>
Yudkowsky whose brain contains a map of mathematics in which the statement
<br>
&quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot; is held with 99% confidence but can never rationally be held
<br>
with 100% confidence.  In fact, it is this very hypothesis that my 99%
<br>
confidence attaches to.
<br>
<p>Physics existed before people, and any self-consistent account of the
<br>
universe needs to describe how people arise from physics, rather than the
<br>
reverse.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt; At the beginning of this post I re-quoted the challenge which I will
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; repeat again.  Tell me what the criteria are on the basis of which you
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; distinguish the descriptions which are affirmed as the best on offer by
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; respectable contemporary science, from the super descriptions of &quot;actual
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; physics,&quot; with the special unassailable dignity and authority you seem
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; to attach to these.
</em><br>
<p>The key distinction: the territory of physics, and not our map of it, is
<br>
the causal agent that determines experimental results.  Where our map
<br>
fails to correspond to the territory, observed experimental results differ
<br>
from what our map says they should be.  By then adjusting the map, it can
<br>
be brought into closer correspondence with the territory.  If you have the
<br>
abstract knowledge that the map differs from the territory somewhere, you
<br>
can deliberately perform experiments to uncover those failures of
<br>
correspondence and correct them.  Hence Neil Armstrong.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Yes, descriptions, like tables, bits of turf, electrochemical 
</em><br>
dispositions
<br>
<em> &gt; of neural-nets, and such are all in causal relations to one another.  Do
</em><br>
<em> &gt; you think my pragmatist account of knowledge is *less* causal than yours?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Why so?  I suspect that my account of epistemology is *indistinguishable*
</em><br>
<em> &gt; from yours apart from the weird moments when you start imagining a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Universe that has preferences in the matter of how it should be described
</em><br>
<em> &gt; by humans, and in the quaint moments where you move from describing the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; reasons for holding your beliefs and begin to congratulate them in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; addition as &quot;accurately modeling,&quot; &quot;representing,&quot; &quot;mirroring,&quot; or
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;picturing&quot; the world, all of which looks like non-causal decoration with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; little force beyond the difference in saying you believe something and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; saying you really really really believe something.
</em><br>
<p>If you forbid the discussion of the abstract fact that the territory
<br>
exists, on the mere grounds that any discussion of specific territory must
<br>
use a map, then there is no way to explain the greater observed efficacy
<br>
of science as compared to magic.
<br>
<p>People like me have the idea that the *purpose* of a map, its reason for
<br>
existence, is the territory.  This is why we object to, for example, your
<br>
assumption that any talk of a hard takeoff *must* be bad because it can,
<br>
given a sufficiently vague understanding (sorry!) and a lot of loose
<br>
analogizing, be made to look vaguely similar to at least one map produced
<br>
at some time by the vast and incoherent engine of human mythology.  From
<br>
my perspective, a map that includes a hard takeoff is a bad thing if a
<br>
hard takeoff fails to materialize, and a map that includes a hard takeoff
<br>
is a good thing if a hard takeoff actually happens.  Again, the fact that
<br>
we have no direct access to this level of reality does not mean it does
<br>
not exist; it is, for example, what would be expected to determine whether
<br>
our subjective experience of watching an AI mature ever includes the
<br>
subjective experience of watching the AI undergo a hard takeoff.
<br>
<p>*If* you were to show that AI undergoing a hard takeoff is something we
<br>
should estimate as extremely unlikely given the rational/scientific rules
<br>
for determining how well a prospective map is likely to correspond to
<br>
territory, you would *then* be licensed to derisively compare my map of AI
<br>
to various noncorrespondent mythological maps, hypothesizing that there
<br>
was a common cause of failure in both cases.   But until then, the simple
<br>
map of &quot;an AI will probably undergo a hard takeoff, and this is why&quot; is
<br>
more important to me than any metamap comparison between that simple map
<br>
and various mythological maps; a territorially correct map is worthwhile
<br>
in itself, even if it is not politically correct.
