<em>&gt; &gt; In fact, I believe my AI design is a lot more fully worked out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than Eliezer's is.  So far as I know (my last data point being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when I had a long chat with him over dinner a couple months ago),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eliezer really hasn't attempted to formulate a design for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; general AI in detail, although he has done a bunch of interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cog. sci. work in this direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/LOGI/">http://www.intelligence.org/LOGI/</a> doesn't count?
</em><br>
<p>That is not a detailed design, it's a conceptual sketch.
<br>
<p>A detailed software design is something you can give to a competent team of
<br>
programmers and have them implement it.
<br>
<p>A detailed &quot;AI design&quot; is something you can give to a team of computer
<br>
scientists and software architects and have them create a detailed software
<br>
design.
<br>
<p>Novamente has a detailed AI design (not given on the Web, contained only in
<br>
privately held documents).  We are creating a detailed software design from
<br>
it incrementally, as we proceed in building and working with the system.
<br>
<p>LOGI does not constitute a detailed AI design; rather, it constitutes what
<br>
I'd call a &quot;conceptual AI design&quot; --- a set of ideas about how to go about
<br>
creating a detailed AI design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no attachment to Eliezer himself, but I honestly don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; know anyone else that's doing what he's doing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eliezer is one of a few individuals who are devoting a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their time to exploring the implications of the Singularity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the issue of AI friendliness.  He's not the only one -- Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hibbard is another, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As for me, I'm spending only a little of my time on such issues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and more of my time on nitty-gritty stuff related to general AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; design, as well as on related issues such as using AI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand the human organism and how to repair its flaws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See, that worries me a bit, because if I read you correctly you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said you're working an AGI but not really on Friendliness.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really, really frightening to me.
</em><br>
<p>My belief is that it's not possible to understand Friendliness very well
<br>
through theory.  I plan to understand Friendliness better through
<br>
experimenting with AGI's whose general intelligence is roughly in the
<br>
dog-to-chimp range.  But I'm not even there yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd actually very much like to see a joint paper between you and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, or even a good e-mail thread, describing the differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between your approaches and why you aren't working together.
</em><br>
<p>Those email threads occured on SL4 in 2001 and 2002.  I guess you can look
<br>
them up ;-)
<br>
<p>In essence, we have
<br>
<p>-- differences of technical intuition regarding how to go about building an
<br>
AGI
<br>
<p>-- differing opinions on how possible it is to meaningfully understand AI
<br>
friendliness on a theoretical basis, prior to having moderately powerful
<br>
AGI's to experiment with
<br>
