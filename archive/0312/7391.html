<p>As an aside, I'm slightly curious about the extent to which it's true that
<br>
Eliezer &quot;originated the idea&quot; of Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>I'm fairly certain he introduced that particular phrase, but is it really
<br>
true that no previous author wrote any kind of systematic essay on the
<br>
topic?  I haven't done historical research on this, and I'm wondering if
<br>
anyone else on this list has.  If anyone digs up any ancient history in this
<br>
regard, please let me know -- not so much because I'm interested in who has
<br>
&quot;priority&quot; on the idea, but because I'd like to read what was written about
<br>
the topic in the past.
<br>
<p>Of course, it's not at all true that Eliezer was the first one to think at
<br>
length about the topic -- I thought about it plenty years before Eliezer was
<br>
born, and many sci-fi folks thought about it decades before I was born, etc.
<br>
But I'm wondering if anyone in the past took the trouble to write something
<br>
clear and systematic about it, before Eliezer came along?
<br>
<p>This kind of historical question isn't so easy to resolve, of course,
<br>
because old writings tend not to be on the Web unless they're famous...
<br>
there's actually a significant historical research problem here.
