William Calvin made a decent argument, in The Ascent of Mind, that human
<br>
brain size was limited during evolution by the size of the human female
<br>
vagina.  In short, our heads couldn't be any bigger or they wouldn't fit out
<br>
the birth canal; and, there were good evolutionary reasons why it was hard
<br>
for the vaginal canal to get much wider.
<br>
<p>I don't think there is a correlation between high IQ and psychological
<br>
problems.  If there were, I guess it would likely be ascribable to
<br>
difficulties associated from being too far away from the mean of society in
<br>
any major dimension, rather than due to intrinsic problems associated with
<br>
intelligence.
