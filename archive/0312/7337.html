<p>No, I mean the real thing. A neural net (there are some 100 types
<br>
of various ANNs) is an abstraction, capturing
<br>
only few relevant aspects of the actual tissue. It is a good reality check
<br>
to see how far ANNs are remote from something they're supposed to
<br>
be a decent model of.
<br>
<p>In biology, the system and the representation have coevolved. There is no
<br>
separation between state and the physical layer, they're amalgamated.
<br>
The system uses noise and dirt effects to do computation. It turns
<br>
ugly warts into actual advantages. 
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Yes. Thats the problem, but at all levels. In the cell the context becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very important, first of all the DNA decoding machinery which luckily for 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; thats just one cell not a complete human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So still most of biology must be empirical.
</em><br>
<p>We can't even image a whole cell at molecular resolution yet!
<br>
Not even small representative patches of it. It is really quite
<br>
pathetic. We don't even have the data to put into our computers,
<br>
and nevermind our computers are far too feeble to probe any
<br>
interesting scales on which biological processes occur. 
<br>
We can't even do protein folding yet! Utterly hilarious.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; True. But even with those tools many answers will be found empirically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through simulation, rather than direct mathmatical derivations from first
</em><br>
<p>There are people who would burn you at the stake for mouthing 'empirical'
<br>
right next to 'simulation' :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; principles. The world already has a large heritage of such mental 
</em><br>
<p>Mathematical derivations from first principles are something you do
<br>
physics with. They're really quite irrelevant to biology (you can
<br>
derive forcefield parameters from QM, but the quality is so lousy
<br>
you'd be better advised to use empirical measurements to get at it).
<br>
<p>Nevermind that simulations are next to useless in biology.
<br>
It's more a crude mockup of the real thing; it has only relatively
<br>
recently started generating new knowledge -- eyed suspiciously,
<br>
because you frequently can't validate the observation in machina
<br>
empirically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; observations, regrettably they are often overlooked because they have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the label 'spirituality', rather than 'psychology'.
</em><br>
<p>I can't parse either; both are irrelevant to current science.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe in a human like God, its an absurd notion. Yet I also know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that belief in a God works for people. I suspect why it works as unPC as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it sounds is because God is a surrogate imaginary alpha-male. An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alpha-male so powerful that his authority is never open to challenge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gaining a permanent state of submission and surrender from true believers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But also a dangerous thing, because anyone claiming to represent God can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have unquestioning followers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The regrettable thing about modern psychology is that it started from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scratch. It didn't look at what actually works and adopt that for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific age.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to build AI, you can completely throw out psychology
<br>
(or philosophy, for that matter; a remarkably sterile are of human
<br>
inquiry) out of the window. 
<br>
<p>You'd do much better with neuroscience, or building IT systems
<br>
in simulators from first principles. We don't have nearly enough
<br>
performance for that, though, so for time being the best we can do
<br>
is to use neuroscience to watch minds at work.
