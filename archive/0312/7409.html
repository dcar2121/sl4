<p>Actually, it would seem easier to &quot;bomb the world to the stone
<br>
age&quot;.  The organizations that humans have built to do social
<br>
engineering are machines which are prone to error and sloppiness.
<br>
They don't even accomplish most of the stated goals, so why
<br>
would you think that they are proof against errors involving
<br>
nukes?
<br>
<p>One of the major problems with such machines is that they
<br>
often produce outcomes that no individual humans in them
<br>
claim to want, which sounds just like the kind of machine
<br>
that might accidentally produce such a horrible outcome.
