<em>&gt; True, but no disproof exists.

<p>Operating on the assumption that that something which may or may not
<br>
be possible will happen seems imprudent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If anyone thinks they
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I can -- or at least, why it wouldn't be stable. There are several
<br>
problems here, including the fact that there is no absolute morality (and
<br>
thus no way to universally determine &quot;the good&quot;), that it is not
<br>
obvious that one could construct something far more intelligent than
<br>
yourself and still manage to constrain its behavior effectively, that
<br>
it is not clear that a construct like this would be able to battle it
<br>
out effectively against other constructs from societies that do not
<br>
construct Friendly AIs (or indeed that the winner in the universe
<br>
won't be the societies that produce the meanest, baddest-assed
<br>
intelligences rather than the friendliest -- see evolution on earth),
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I find it interesting to speculate on possible constructs like
<br>
The Friendly AI, but not safe to assume that they're going to be in
<br>
one's future. The prudent transhumanist considers survival in wide
<br>
variety of scenarios.
