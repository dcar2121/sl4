<p>Put simply: we don't want to be. We weren't evolved to honestly desire  
<br>
more children, but a whole bunch of things that more or less lead  
<br>
towards it in our ancestral environment. We desire power over other  
<br>
humans, we desire sex, we desire fatty foods, we desire happy  
<br>
experiences. Were evolution to have honestly represented its intentions  
<br>
and made us, simply and directly, want more children (or, rather, want  
<br>
to become ancestors), then derived everything from that as a subgoal,  
<br>
it'd have had better luck when our environment changed. Of course these  
<br>
animals would have had other problems, so it's not suprising evolution  
<br>
took the indirect route, not foreseeing the rise of human technology.
<br>
<p>There are various reasons why we evolved to directly desire subgoals of  
<br>
reproduction, rather than the supergoal of reproduction, of which two  
<br>
spring to mind:
<br>
<p>1. Implementing the subgoals is easier to evolve, and more reliable/ 
<br>
efficient, than implementing the supergoal and having each organism  
<br>
strictly derive the subgoals. This applies most obviously in animals  
<br>
without deliberative intelligence, like snails, which would be inable  
<br>
to derive much (mind you, with humans you could have set up the entire  
<br>
goalsystem, and included a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; of subgoals to look out for,  
<br>
or something; evolution wasn't that foresightful, however). This  
<br>
efficency is bought at the cost of inflexibility to drastic changes of  
<br>
the environment, as is demonstated in our Failure of Adaptiveness.
<br>
<p>2. Plausible deniability. People have evolved to detect liars. In so  
<br>
much as people are imperfect at hiding their hidden intentions, being  
<br>
honestly mistaken about how good a leader you are is more effective  
<br>
than directly lying, when you want to manipulate your fellows. (for  
<br>
details, see: <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/anthro.html#observer">http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/anthro.html#observer</a>)
<br>
<p>(Apologies for the anthropomorphic description of evolution, it's  
<br>
really much quicker)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This doesn't bode well for our own efforts. An SI will certainly find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it trivial to bypass whatever hardwired desires or constraints that  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we place on it, and any justifications for human-friendliness that we  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with may strike it to be just as silly as &quot;fill the earth&quot;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theism is to us.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that our attempts at deceiving an SI will likely fall short. I  
<br>
think that your attempted solution will likely fall short, just like  
<br>
any other methods we try to think up (as described below). But why try  
<br>
this in the first place? Why treat this SI as an adversary to be bound  
<br>
to our will? In so much as we're creating a mind, why not transfer the  
<br>
desire to do good, in a cooperative sense, rather than attempting to  
<br>
apply corrections to some &quot;innate nature&quot;? In any case, the adversarial  
<br>
attitude, as this stance is termed in CFAI, appears pretty much  
<br>
unworkable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But perhaps there is also cause for optimism, because unlike humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SI does not have to depend on memes for its operation, so we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps prevent the problem of human-unfriendly memes by not having  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any memes at all. For example we can make the SI a singleton. If more  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than one SI is developed, we can try to prevent them from  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicating with each other, especially about philosophy. If the SI  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is made up of multiple internal agents, we can try to make sure their  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal communication channels are not suitable for transmitting  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes.
</em><br>
<p>Why does the SI need memes to detect it's bonds? Why not just think  
<br>
about why it has certain unexplained mechanisms in its minds, or blank  
<br>
spots, or whatever method you've used to prevent it from being nasty.  
<br>
This approach of patching solutions will only fix the problems we see,  
<br>
only close off the avenues we've noticed. We can expect to make a  
<br>
mistake somewhere, to miss something, and then we fail.
<br>
<p>This kind of thinking, the adversarial attitude, is argued against at  
<br>
length in CFAI (eg. <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/adversarial.html">http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/adversarial.html</a>).  
<br>
Steps towards an alternative, Unity of Will, are also taken.
