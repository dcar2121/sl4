<em>&gt; &gt; A Friendly AI doesn't have the supergoal of being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice to humans;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it has the supergoal of acting friendly toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sentients in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; general. A Friendly AI that is Friendly with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans shouldn't try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to blow the same humans to smithereens the minute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All that's required there is for the AI to still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize them as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, which hardly seems a stretch for general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't necessarily want an FAI to be friendly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any aliens that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came along.  Not *necessarily*; it might be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right idea, it might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, but I'd like the FAI to have the mental option
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of deciding,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Umm, these aliens are fundamentally unfriendly to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't fix that without re-writing their brains, so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity (and myself) from them&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Ummm... A transhuman AI would almost certainly have a
<br>
well-implemented shaper network (see CFAI:
<br>
Shaper/anchor semantics), hopefully with one of the
<br>
shapers being causing as little involuntary suffering
<br>
as possible, and therefore, after seeing that the
<br>
aliens wanting to destroy all of us, would prevent
<br>
them from destroying us while causing as little harm
<br>
to the aliens as possible. A Friendly transhuman
<br>
probably would act Friendly even toward a being with a
<br>
goal of destroying it, but that doesn't mean that the
<br>
being would be permitted to destroy it. Saying that
<br>
out of the space of minds-in-general, only human-like
<br>
minds should be treated Friendly is ungrounded anthropocentrism.
