<p>
Why are we not faithful servants of our genes? Instead, the defenses our
<br>
genes built against parasitic memes are breaking down, resulting in entire
<br>
societies falling below replacement fertility rate even as we enjoy
<br>
unprecendented riches in technology and material resources. Genes built
<br>
our brains in the hope that we will remain friendly to them, and they
<br>
appear to have failed. Why? And is there anything we can learn from their
<br>
catastrophe as we try to build our own friendly higher-intelligence?
<br>
<p>I think the reason we're becoming increasingly unfriendly to genes is that
<br>
parasitic memes are evolving too fast for genes and their symbiotic
<br>
defensive memes to keep up, and this is the result of a series of advances
<br>
in communications technology starting with the printing press. Genes
<br>
evolved two ways of ensuring our friendliness - hardwired desires and
<br>
hosting a system of mutually reinforcing philosophies learned during
<br>
childhood that defines and justifies friendliness toward genes.
<br>
Unfortunately for the genes, those hardwired desires have proven easy to
<br>
bypass once a certain level of technology is reached (e.g., development of
<br>
birth control), and the best philosophical defense for gene-friendliness
<br>
that evolution could come up with after hundreds of thousands of years is
<br>
the existence of a God that wants humans to be fertile.
<br>
<p>This doesn't bode well for our own efforts. An SI will certainly find it
<br>
trivial to bypass whatever hardwired desires or constraints that we place
<br>
on it, and any justifications for human-friendliness that we come up with
<br>
may strike it to be just as silly as &quot;fill the earth&quot; theism is to us.
<br>
<p>But perhaps there is also cause for optimism, because unlike humans, the
<br>
SI does not have to depend on memes for its operation, so we can perhaps
<br>
prevent the problem of human-unfriendly memes by not having any memes at
<br>
all. For example we can make the SI a singleton. If more than one SI is
<br>
developed, we can try to prevent them from communicating with each other,
<br>
especially about philosophy. If the SI is made up of multiple internal
<br>
agents, we can try to make sure their internal communication channels are
<br>
not suitable for transmitting memes.
<br>
<p>Happy New Year!
