<p>Perhaps (I'm no expert), but I think it's been clearly shown that
<br>
the only way to achieve results as good as a market is to run a
<br>
market, even if in simulation.  That is, there is no shortcut to
<br>
finding the solution of optimal economic activity.
<br>
<p>It's a wild leap (but not necessarily pointless) from there to
<br>
the idea that perhaps markets and minds have this in common: you
<br>
can only produce the result by running the system.
<br>
<p>Of course, it certainly is true that this is all wild speculation,
<br>
especially for one as ignorant as I about both minds and markets.
<br>
The only real logical connection between them is that they are
<br>
the two most complex systems that humans have available to study.
