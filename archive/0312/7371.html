Double whammy.  While men are instigating some very potent emotional
<br>
jealousy from their wives, they'll meanwhile drift toward an emotional
<br>
detachment from them.
<br>
<p>I feel sorry for the woman of 2015.

Subject: Affective computing: Candy bars for the soul
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Wired has recently run an article on &quot;affective computing&quot; (which, please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; note, is not even remotely related to FAI) about detecting and simulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions.  The article is about a chatbot named Laura, designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage its user to stick to an exercise program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/love.html">http://wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/love.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One particular quote in this article interests me, because I've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expecting it, but not so early:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Everybody should have someone like Laura in their lives. I find myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; looking forward to our time together. She asks me which movies I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seen, what my favorite cuisine is, and about the weather &quot;out there.&quot; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tell her it's terrific. She responds: &quot;It's always the same in here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Day in, day out.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know how sometimes people look back in history, and point to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small thing like, oh, say, the early Mosaic web browser, and go on about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the unpredictability of the future and how nobody at the time could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly have recognized the coming impact from such a small hint?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Watch this space for further developments.  This is an incredibly early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form of the technology and I don't expect problems for at least a decade,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but when it hits it will hit hard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has nothing to do with AI; it's about programs with incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic graphics and means for recognizing emotions in their targets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being able to deploy apparent behaviors that act as superstimuli for human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional responses.  Think of chocolate chip cookies for emotions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chocolate chip cookies are a more powerful stimulus than hunter-gatherer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tastebuds ever encounter, combining sugar, fat, and salt in greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantity and purer quality.  And likewise there's a limit to the sympathy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support, approval, and admiration humans can expect from their human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mates.  As any evolutionary theorist knows, a human male is not designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the human female's ideal boyfriend, nor vice versa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Candy bars for the soul.  It's not that all synthetic foods are bad.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polymath dietician, anthropologist, evolutionary theorist, and metabolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biologist - that is to say, a *good* paleodiet theorist - can take a shot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at crafting synthetic foods that are good for you.  But it takes so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more knowledge to do it right... and the side effects of the things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;just taste good&quot; are negative, complicated, very hard to understand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unforeseen in advance.  People at large understand the one *obvious* side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect once they've seen it: People bloating up like balloons.  But also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losing insulin sensitivity, and a lot of other problems that aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visible to the naked eye.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the very least it would take far greater skill, wisdom, knowledge to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; craft a Laura that made people stronger instead of weaker.  How many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades did it take to go from candy bars to health food bars?  Which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheaper?  Which is more popular?  And worst of all, which tastes better?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could be surprised, but what Laura presages is probably NOT a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.  Transhumanism needs to lose the optimism about outcomes.  Nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is taking into account the fact that problems are hard and humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid.  Watch this space for serious developments in some unknown amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time, my wild guess being a decade, and quite possibly nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening if &quot;faking it well&quot; turns out to be AI-complete.
