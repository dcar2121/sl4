<p>Well, there is mild evidence.  Anecdotally, at least,
<br>
those with very high intelligence are prone to various

other mental problems.
<br>
<p>While one can argue that the haphazard design of human
<br>
brains makes them susceptible to errors at high complexity
<br>
that generic intelligences need not exhibit, the reverse
<br>
is also a possibility.  That is, it might be that the
<br>
structures required for anything we'd recognize as a
<br>
person are necessarily limited in complexity.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I have a suspicion (not really well defined in
<br>
my mind yet) that the universal failure of command
<br>
economies is telling us something fundamental about
<br>
complexity in our universe.
