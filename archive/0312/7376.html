There's also the Joy of Infliction, and it's here already (but not in New
<br>
Zealand, not legally anyway):

<p>NZ bans computer game for repetitive extreme violence
<br>
Wellington
<br>
December 12, 2003
<br>
<p><p>A computer video game that encourages players to kill everyone in sight in
<br>
ever more gruesome ways has been banned in New Zealand.
<br>
<p>Manhunt, a DVD-ROM console game produced in Playstation 2 format, is the
<br>
first video game banned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification.
<br>
<p>Chief censor Bill Hastings said today while computer games appeared to be
<br>
getting more &quot;edgy&quot;, Manhunt went further than any game previously referred
<br>
to his office.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a game where the only thing you do is kill everybody you see,&quot; he
<br>
said. &quot;It gets worse. Not only do you have to kill everybody you see, you
<br>
can choose to kill 'mild,' 'medium' or 'hot'.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hastings said &quot;hot&quot; kills were particularly gruesome. Weapons used ranged
<br>
from shards of glass to garotting wire, plastic bags and machetes.
<br>
<p>The game was set in a weird city inhabited by criminals and psychotics.
<br>
Through an earpiece, players were given instructions by a person making
<br>
snuff films to kill everyone they saw.
<br>
<p>&quot;When you go for the 'hot' kill you actually see the snuff film... you see
<br>
the person being killed in close-up. With the plastic bag, for example, you
<br>
see the victim's mouth gasping for air inside the bag.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>Hastings said the game was produced by American company Rockstar Games, &quot;the
<br>
same people who brought us Grand Theft Auto&quot; - a controversial video game
<br>
sharply criticised by opponents of media violence.
<br>
<p>An updated version of that game - Grand Theft Auto 3 - is the subject of a
<br>
$US246 million ($A333.6 million) lawsuit in the US by families of two people
<br>
shot by teenagers allegedly inspired by the game.
<br>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 3 is classified in New Zealand as R18, restricting its sale
<br>
or hire to persons over 18.
<br>
<p>Unlike the Grand Theft Auto series, which Hastings conceded had an element
<br>
of humour in its depiction of police chases, Manhunt &quot;has none of that
<br>
whatsoever&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;In fact, you're rewarded for making the kills as gruesome as possible
<br>
because that's the only way you can unlock the (game's) four bonus levels.&quot;
<br>
<p>Manhunt had been banned from sale or hire in New Zealand for its likely
<br>
effect on &quot;players of any age,&quot; Mr Hastings said.
<br>
<p>In its 12-page decision, the classification office ruled that Manhunt
<br>
depicted and dealt with matters of horror, cruelty, crime and violence in
<br>
such a manner that its availability was likely to be injurious to the public
<br>
good.
<br>
<p>&quot;The only way you can accommodate the game's images is by an attitudinal
<br>
shift,&quot; Hastings said. &quot;You have to at least acquiesce in these murders and
<br>
possibly tolerate, or even move towards enjoying them, which is injurious to
<br>
the public good.&quot;
