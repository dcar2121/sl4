While reviewing 2003, I ran across this article, which describes 
<br>
humanity's creation of yet another Artifact like the Clock of the Long 
<br>
Now.  The key point is highlighted in the article's body for your convenience.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's probably the roundest item ever made by hand. 'If the earth were 
<br>
this round, Mount Everest would be four meters tall,' Dr. Nicolaus said. 
<br>
An intriguing characteristic of this smooth ball is that there is no way 
<br>
to tell whether it is spinning or at rest. Only if a grain of dust lands 
<br>
on the surface is there something for the eye to track.&quot;
<br>
<p>Whatever would an alien species make of the Silicon Sphere, I wonder? 
<br>
Would they ever guess its purely philosophical purpose?
<br>
<p>A cheering sign that humanity is still progressing toward becoming an 
<br>
Incomprehensible Elder Species.

<p>Scientists Struggling to Make the Kilogram Right Again
<br>
NYT May 27, 2003
<br>
By OTTO POHL
<br>
<p>BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany - In these girth-conscious times,
<br>
even weight itself has weight issues. The kilogram is
<br>
getting lighter, scientists say, sowing potential confusion
<br>
over a range of scientific endeavor.
<br>
<p>The kilogram is defined by a platinum-iridium cylinder,
<br>
cast in England in 1889. No one knows why it is shedding
<br>
weight, at least in comparison with other reference
<br>
weights, but the change has spurred an international search
<br>
for a more stable definition.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's certainly not helpful to have a standard that keeps
<br>
changing,&quot; says Peter Becker, a scientist at the Federal
<br>
Standards Laboratory here, an institution of 1,500
<br>
scientists dedicated entirely to improving the ability to
<br>
measure things precisely.
<br>
<p>Even the apparent change of 50 micrograms in the kilogram -
<br>
less than the weight of a grain of salt - is enough to
<br>
distort careful scientific calculations.
<br>
<p>Dr. Becker is leading a team of international researchers
<br>
seeking to redefine the kilogram as a number of atoms of a
<br>
selected element. Other scientists, including researchers
<br>
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
<br>
Washington, are developing a competing technology to define
<br>
the kilogram using a complex mechanism known as the watt
<br>
balance.
<br>
<p>The final recommendation will be made by the International
<br>
Committee on Weights and Measures, a body created by
<br>
international treaty in 1875. The agency guards the
<br>
international reference kilogram and keeps it in a heavily
<br>
guarded safe in a château outside Paris. It is visited once
<br>
a year, under heavy security, by the only three people to
<br>
have keys to the safe. The weight change has been noted on
<br>
the occasions it has been removed for measurement.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's part ceremony and part obligation,&quot; Dr. Richard
<br>
Davis, head of the mass section at the research arm of the
<br>
international committee.
<br>
<p>&quot;You'd have to amend the treaty if you didn't do it this
<br>
way.&quot;
<br>
<p>That ceremony has become a little sorrowful as the guest of
<br>
honor appears to be, on a microscopic level at least,
<br>
wasting away.
<br>
<p>The race is already well under way to determine a new
<br>
standard, although at a measured pace, since creating
<br>
reliable measurements is such painstaking work.
<br>
<p>The kilogram is the only one of the seven base units of
<br>
measurement that still retain its 19th-century definition.
<br>
Over the years, scientists have redefined units like the
<br>
meter (first based on the earth's circumference) and the
<br>
second (conceived as a fraction of a day). The meter is now
<br>
the distance light travels in one-299,792,458th of a
<br>
second, and a second is the time it takes for a cesium atom
<br>
to vibrate 9,192,631,770 times. Each can be measured with
<br>
remarkable precision, and, equally important, can be
<br>
reproduced anywhere.
<br>
<p>The kilogram was conceived to be the mass of a liter of
<br>
water, but accurately measuring a liter of water proved to
<br>
be very difficult. Instead, an English goldsmith was hired
<br>
to make a platinum-iridium cylinder that would be used to
<br>
define the kilogram.
<br>
<p>One reason the kilogram has lagged behind the other units
<br>
is that there has been no immediate practical benefit to
<br>
increasing its precision. Nonetheless, the drift in the
<br>
kilogram's weight carries over to other measurements. The
<br>
volt, for example, is defined in terms of the kilogram, so
<br>
a stable kilogram definition will allow the volt to be tied
<br>
more closely to the base units of measure.
<br>
<p>A total of 80 copies of the reference kilogram have been
<br>
created and distributed to signatories of the metric
<br>
treaty. The sometimes colorful history of these small metal
<br>
cylinders underscores how long the world has used the same
<br>
definition of the kilogram.
<br>
<p>Some of the metal plugs were issued to countries that later
<br>
vanished, including Serbia and the Dutch East Indies. The
<br>
Japanese had to surrender theirs after World War II.
<br>
Germany has acquired several weights, including the one
<br>
issued to Bavaria in 1889 and the one that belonged to East
<br>
Germany.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To update the kilogram, Germany is working with scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from countries including Australia, Italy and Japan to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce a perfectly round one-kilogram silicon crystal. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea is that by knowing exactly what atoms are in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crystal, how far apart they are and the size of the ball,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of atoms in the ball can be calculated. That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number then becomes the definition of a kilogram. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To separate the three isotopes of silicon, Dr. Becker and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his team are turning to old nuclear weapons factories from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Soviet Union, where centrifuges once used to produce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly enriched uranium are able to produce the required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purity of silicon. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We need so many nines,&quot; Dr. Becker said, and Soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uranium processors are one of the only places to get them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;With the Russians, we're getting about four of them,&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 99.99 percent pure silicon 28. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A test crystal has already been produced, and Dr. Arnold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nicolaus, another scientist at the German standards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laboratory, is responsible for measuring whether it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly round. He has measured the crystal in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half-million places to determine its shape. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's probably the roundest item ever made by hand. &quot;If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earth were this round, Mount Everest would be four meters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tall,&quot; Dr. Nicolaus said. An intriguing characteristic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this smooth ball is that there is no way to tell whether it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is spinning or at rest. Only if a grain of dust lands on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the surface is there something for the eye to track. 
</em><br>
<p>Scientists from the United States, England, France and
<br>
Switzerland say the challenge of calculating the precise
<br>
number of atoms in a silicon crystal is too imprecise with
<br>
today's technology so they are refining a technique to
<br>
calculate the kilogram using voltage.
<br>
<p>&quot;Measuring energy is easier than counting atoms,&quot; said Dr.
<br>
Richard Steiner, a scientist at the National Institute of
<br>
Standards and Technology in Washington, who is leading the
<br>
international project to create the watt scale.
<br>
<p>In the last few weeks, he has reported that his experiments
<br>
have yielded data that are close to what they need. &quot;Now
<br>
we're into the picayune, itsy-bitsy errors,&quot; he said,
<br>
having recently corrected &quot;totally ridiculous&quot; errors of
<br>
100 parts per million.
<br>
<p>The idea of the watt balance is to measure the
<br>
electromagnetic force needed to balance a reference
<br>
kilogram. As long as the gravitational field is precisely
<br>
known for the location of the experiment, the mass on the
<br>
scale can be related to power. (The gravitational field is
<br>
a complicated calculation that needs among other things
<br>
constantly updated changes in tidal forces.)
<br>
<p>The definition of the kilogram would then be a measurement
<br>
of that power or in terms of something that could be
<br>
derived from it, like the mass of an electron. The
<br>
experiment in Washington is occurring in a large
<br>
three-story structure, but in spite of the complexity and
<br>
circuitous route of calculating mass, Dr. Steiner says he
<br>
is confident that his team will have persuasive data
<br>
shortly.
<br>
<p>&quot;In the short term, I think we'll win,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Dr. Davis, who is working closely with those making the final
<br>
decision about the fate of the kilogram, says he is not so
<br>
sure. &quot;In terms of published results, the watt balance is
<br>
closer of the two,&quot; he said. &quot;But it's very hard to say
<br>
which is better.&quot;
<br>
<p>Many scientists believe that the most elegant way to define
<br>
the kilogram is by counting out a kilo's worth of atoms of
<br>
an element. A project is under way to test that with gold
<br>
atoms. But the sheer number of atoms in a kilogram, a
<br>
number with roughly 25 digits in it, makes that approach
<br>
unfeasible for the foreseeable future.
<br>
<p>For now, Dr. Davis is willing to set his sights lower in
<br>
the error-prone world of superprecision measurements. &quot;It
<br>
would be nice,&quot; he said, &quot;just to have two experiments in
<br>
the world that agreed with each other.&quot;
