<em>&gt; &gt;a Friendly AI must be the first being to develop strong nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Earth,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;or one of the first, or we are all going to die in a mass of grey goo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something about this strikes me as wrong-headed. Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grey goo is considerably closer in time than Friendly AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an imperative like this will lead people to focus on stopping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;strong nanotech&quot;, rather than creating Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm...
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
I don't see any strong reason to believe that strong nanotech is closer in
<br>
time than Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>Nanohype is at a maximum currently, but that doesn't mean that strong
<br>
nanotech is just around the corner.
<br>
<p>Taking a dispassionate point of view, surely the scientific jury is still
<br>
out regarding the question of whether strong AI or strong nanotech will
<br>
arrive first.
<br>
<p>My own perspective is that strong AI is closer, but arguing for this
<br>
perspective is not my goal in this message.
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
It's just not true that humans developing strong nanotech will *necessarily*
<br>
lead to destruction.
<br>
<p>Whether strong nanotech, in human hands, leads to destruction or not depends
<br>
on a lot of &quot;details&quot; including scientific and political ones.
<br>
<p>Similarly, lot of people thought the advent of nukes would lead to world
<br>
destruction.  Well, it still could.  But for a combination of technological
<br>
and political reasons, this certainly isn't a necessary consequence of the
<br>
existence of nuclear weapons...
<br>
<p><p><p>What I see in these various overconfident statements is a fear of the
<br>
unknown --- an attempt to place order on the unknown future by making
<br>
unwarranted assumptions.  We can't rationally assume so much about what's
<br>
coming -- as much as, emotionally, we might like to.
<br>
<p>So far as preparing for the future goes, the most important thing is to get
<br>
ourselves -- individually and collectively, with whatever human and/or AI
<br>
intelligence is available -- in a mental position that is capable of dealing
<br>
adequately with the advent of wild surprises.  This is much more important
<br>
than planning for any particular conjectural contingency.
<br>
