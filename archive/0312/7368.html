<p>
My own prediction is that, barring a Singularity
<br>
or catastrophe, human population will peak around
<br>
8 billion in about a generation.  My reasons for
<br>
this lower estimate are the spread of development
<br>
to more of the world and underestimates of the
<br>
impact of the AIDS epidemic on population.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the global population would reach 244
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion in 2150 and 134
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trillion in 2300.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's hoping for a Singularity that isn't delayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by 300 years in a fertile
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society.
</em><br>
<p>I can think of a couple of reasons that such an
<br>
outcome won't happen:
<br>
<p>1) The rate of progress is some function of the
<br>
number brains (human at present), their education,
<br>
and the amount of time they spend working on new
<br>
stuff.  All three components have been increasing
<br>
over the past few centuries, and there is no reason
<br>
to expect a huge retrogression in education or
<br>
fraction working on new stuff.  As a proxy, the
<br>
latter factor can be measured as the number of
<br>
scientists &amp; engineers in the world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So in a future world with vastly increased
<br>
population, I would expect progress to be even
<br>
faster than our present rapid pace, and thus
<br>
a Singularity, if it is to occur, to occur sooner
<br>
rather than later.
<br>
<p>2)US energy consumption per person is 11 KW.
<br>
At room temperature a blackbody can radiate 500W
<br>
per square meter.  Therefore you need 22 square 
<br>
meters per person to dump the waste heat.  The
<br>
surface of the Earth is 511 trillion square 
<br>
meters, thus the maximum population that can
<br>
be supported is 23 trillion.  One would hope
<br>
that by 2300 AD the average development level
<br>
of the world would equal the US of today.
<br>
<p>I'm pretty sure there are other constraints that
<br>
would prevent a population on Earth from getting
<br>
that high, but simply getting rid of the waste
<br>
heat sets an upper bound.
