<p>This is not at all true.  I think it's quite arguable that
<br>
strong superintelligence is impossible.  For instance, it
<br>
might be that physical law doesn't permit complexity above
<br>
some ceiling.  If so, it might be that the smartest possible
<br>
humans are already very close to that limit.
<br>
<p>This might not seem very likely to you, but unless you
<br>
can logically rule it out, it isn't incompatible with
<br>
a technologically induced singularity (in the weak sense).
