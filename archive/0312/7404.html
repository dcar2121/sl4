<em>&gt;  The only substantial difference between the

<em>&gt; singularity claims to have had a vision from god.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I've had a few visions from various entities claiming to be gods,
<br>
in my day ;-)  [I fondly recall once in the fairly distant past, while
<br>
tripping on mushrooms, when God addressed me in the form of a McDonald's
<br>
french fry.  Yep, I ate him!]
<br>
<p>However, I just take such experiences as exciting inspirations, not as
<br>
absolute truths to be followed.
<br>
<p>Singularitarianism takes scientific and rational values as foundational --
<br>
that is what distinguishes it from nearly all religions.
<br>
<p>Scientists can get their inspiration from divine visions or from the garbage
<br>
heap.  What's critical to science is not the source of inspirations, but
<br>
rather the methodology for validating/falsifying hypotheses.  Kekule
<br>
hypothesized the benzene ring partially by hallucinating snakes eating their
<br>
own tails, but this didn't make him believe his hypothesis -- it was just a
<br>
source of inspiration which led him to testable hypotheses.
<br>
Singularitarianism is not a scientific theory in itself, but it holds to the
<br>
scientific method and the accompanying discipline of rational inference.
<br>
<p>There are some quasi-religious traditions ---- Shambhala is an example ---
<br>
which take rational values as foundational, and these are perhaps closer to
<br>
Singularitarianism than to the more dogmatic traditions lumped into the
<br>
fairly heterogeneous category of &quot;religion&quot;.
<br>
<p>Your statement that there is no evidence for the Singularity is a bit
<br>
misleading.  There is indirect evidence.  There is no direct evidence that
<br>
the stars in the sky are flaming balls of gas either; we believe this
<br>
because of inference based on indirect evidence ... just as we believe in
<br>
the Singularity because of inference based on indirect evidence.  Use of
<br>
indirect evidence does not distinguish science from religion.  Religious
<br>
folks I know believe in reincarnation based on inference from indirect
<br>
evidence --- I have a lot of quibble with their inferences, but...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I know it's fun to write down stuff exactly as it sounds in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; heads, but with Singularity issues, the wrong presentation can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really damage your credibility...  I also think it's important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that we present the FAI meme in a way that doesn't focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eliezer so much - even though he originated the idea, FAI-esque
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking has been going on for the past decade or two, and its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; present day supporters include people like Nick Bostrom, Brian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Atkins, etc, not just Eliezer.  Placing too much emphasis on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eliezer will also make you look like a cult victim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Show me someone else that's actually got a coherent general AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design, then.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm... I believe I have a coherent general AI design (the Novamente AI
<br>
system).  It has not been published but some general verbiage about it can
<br>
be found at www.agiri.org
<br>
<p>In fact, I believe my AI design is a lot more fully worked out than
<br>
Eliezer's is.  So far as I know (my last data point being when I had a long
<br>
chat with him over dinner a couple months ago), Eliezer really hasn't
<br>
attempted to formulate a design for a general AI in detail, although he has
<br>
done a bunch of interesting cog. sci. work in this direction.
<br>
<p>Peter Voss, www.adaptiveai.com, is another guy with Singularitarian leanings
<br>
and a coherent general AI design (his design is also not published,
<br>
however).
<br>
<p>I could give a long list of folks with general AI designs, but I don't
<br>
really have time... a partial list is given on the AGIRI website.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have no attachment to Eliezer himself, but I honestly don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone else that's doing what he's doing.
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer is one of a few individuals who are devoting a lot of their time to
<br>
exploring the implications of the Singularity and the issue of AI
<br>
friendliness.  He's not the only one -- Bill Hibbard is another, for
<br>
example.
<br>
<p>As for me, I'm spending only a little of my time on such issues, and more of
<br>
my time on nitty-gritty stuff related to general AI design, as well as on
<br>
related issues such as using AI to understand the human organism and how to
<br>
repair its flaws.
