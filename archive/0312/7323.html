<p>I assume your talking about neural nets, not magical mystical macro

<p>Yes. Thats the problem, but at all levels. In the cell the context becomes
<br>
very important, first of all the DNA decoding machinery which luckily for 
<br>
us is fairly straight forward in its action, then after that the physics 
<br>
of proteins, as well as the cell environment in which they operate. And
<br>
thats just one cell not a complete human.
<br>
<p>So still most of biology must be empirical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; mysteries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Top-down empiry is a powerful, but also a crude tool. To fully understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology you also need bottom-up from molecular and atomic scale. Currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't have the computational tools to probe that scale at sufficient

</em><br>
<p>True. But even with those tools many answers will be found empirically
<br>
through simulation, rather than direct mathmatical derivations from first
<br>
principles. The world already has a large heritage of such mental 
<br>
observations, regrettably they are often overlooked because they have been
<br>
given the label 'spirituality', rather than 'psychology'.
<br>
<p>I don't believe in a human like God, its an absurd notion. Yet I also know
<br>
that belief in a God works for people. I suspect why it works as unPC as
<br>
it sounds is because God is a surrogate imaginary alpha-male. An
<br>
alpha-male so powerful that his authority is never open to challenge,
<br>
gaining a permanent state of submission and surrender from true believers.
<br>
But also a dangerous thing, because anyone claiming to represent God can
<br>
have unquestioning followers.
<br>
<p>The regrettable thing about modern psychology is that it started from
<br>
scratch. It didn't look at what actually works and adopt that for the
<br>
scientific age.
