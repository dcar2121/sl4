This might be orthogonal to the discussion, I'm not sure, but if it's just
<br>
noise you can always ignore it:
<br>
<p>===========
<br>
<p>William Paulson has urged a similar view [to the epistemological anarchism
<br>
of Paul Feyerabend] - abhorrent to traditionalists in either culture - with
<br>
force and zest.  In the light of our current understanding, he notes, it is
<br>
reasonable to seek in literary studies (and, one might add, paraliterary and
<br>
scientific studies)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;not pure knowledge, not a means of dishing out common cultural fare to
<br>
the many, but a part of the process wherein new concepts, practices, and
<br>
symbolic moves are invented and propagated. . . .
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Literature is the noise of culture, the rich and indeterminate margin
<br>
into which messages are sent off, never to return the same, in which signals
<br>
are received not quite like anything emitted.&quot; (Paulson, The Noise of
<br>
Culture: Literary Texts in a World of Information, 1980: 180)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The frame for Paulson's startling argument is the place we started our
<br>
discussion: information theory understood within a model of life and culture
<br>
as self-organising, creating their own stability and complexity in the face
<br>
of entropy, a picture based on Prigogine's controversial theory of
<br>
thermodynamics far-from-equilibrium (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984; Waldrop,
<br>
1993; Lewin, 1993).  Noise is not necessarily just a `parasite' (as the
<br>
French call it, in an untranslatable pun).  It can be novel information that
<br>
requires a new frame of reference for its reception.  It can be an
<br>
unsettling input into a tired old system from one or more alternative
<br>
structures.  Whether smuggled or welcomed into that system, redefining it,
<br>
such novelties can renew and extend its possible moves in the world - can
<br>
renew even its self-understanding.  Paulson notes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Literature is a discursive form and an archive that is out of step
<br>
with technocratic modernity.  It cannot therefore supply that modernity and
<br>
its political institutions with reassuring narratives or metanarratives to
<br>
live by; it can only perturb them as a kind of noise.  Yet it is only
<br>
because of internal perturbation, whether arising from memory or from the
<br>
plurality of cognitive and discursive strategies, that we can be observers
<br>
of ourselves. . . .  Internal noise, in other words, keeps us from being so
<br>
fully integrated into a silently functioning system that we would cease to
<br>
be aware of it as system.&quot; (Paulson:181)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But while this is true of canonised literature, alternative textualities
<br>
such as postmodern, post-colonial and other marginalised narratives might
<br>
have a larger role still.  Unlike authorised literature, these texts
<br>
sometimes have the capacity to grind noise and grit into the meta-narratives
<br>
which ideology remorselessly drones through our eyes, ears and bodies.  By a
<br>
curious reversal, they constitute a discursive form and an archive which is
<br>
*not* always out of step with technocratic modernity or postmodernity.
<br>
True, this might make such textuality easily co-optable to the work of
<br>
suasion; the postmodern workplace, including the new virtual reality
<br>
cyberspace, is more often decorative than challenging (Benedikt, 1991;
<br>
Rheingold, 1991; Ross, 1991).  Yet it offers as well an enhanced access to
<br>
Paulson's fecund noise.
