Glorious noise
<br>
<p>New Scientist vol 161 issue 2168 - 09 January 1999, page 36
<br>
<p><p>Random noise can be used to drive chemical reactions or stop a 
<br>
spacecraft spinning out of control—you just have to know how to tweak 
<br>
it. Peter McClintock and Dmitri Luchinsky tune in
<br>
<p><p>THERE'S no doubt it's had a bad press. For most of us, noise is what 
<br>
goes on next door when you're trying to sleep. It's that horrible hiss 
<br>
and crackle when an old recording ends or when you try to tune your 
<br>
short-wave radio into the BBC World Service when you're in the Brazilian 
<br>
jungle.
<br>
<p>But within that seemingly meaningless barrage of uncontrolled and 
<br>
usually disruptive rapid-fire shocks lies something far more 
<br>
interesting. If those shocks arrive in just the right sequence, 
<br>
interesting things happen. Without noise, ice would never grow on a lake 
<br>
in winter, nor would chemical reactions happen; noise drives our muscles 
<br>
to contract when they should and it helps our cells to pump crucial 
<br>
materials though their membranes. Life itself wouldn't exist without 
<br>
that messy stuff called noise.
<br>
<p>But how does noise do its work? And if we understand it better, can we 
<br>
harness its power? After studying the problem for some years, we think 
<br>
we've found some answers. Unlike most forces, when noise makes 
<br>
significant things happen, it doesn't do so through a gradual 
<br>
accumulation of effects. Instead, noise does its work all at once in 
<br>
dramatic, exceptional events. To understand the workings of a noisy 
<br>
system, it seems, you can ignore most of what goes on, so long as you 
<br>
keep track of the rare events that really count.
<br>
<p>Physicists' present fascination with noise stems from a discovery made 
<br>
in the 1980s. Suppose you send a weak periodic signal through a noisy 
<br>
black box, and look at the ratio of signal and noise strengths coming 
<br>
out—a measure of quality called the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For 
<br>
some black boxes, it turns out that adding noise at the input actually 
<br>
increases both the signal and the SNR at the output. Adding noise can, 
<br>
paradoxically, boost a signal's ability to get through the system 
<br>
(&quot;Noises on&quot;, New Scientist, 1 June 1996, p 28).
<br>
<p>Stochastic resonance, as this effect is called, has now been seen in 
<br>
black boxes ranging from the sensory neurons in crayfish tails to the 
<br>
microscopic ion channels that carry messages across cell membranes. In 
<br>
the case of crayfish, Frank Moss and his colleagues at the University of 
<br>
Missouri, St Louis, have shown that adding noisy, irregular currents in 
<br>
the water near the crayfish's tail increases its ability to detect 
<br>
regular, periodic fluid motions which might betray the presence of a 
<br>
predator.
<br>
<p>How does this strange effect work? Imagine that the black box is a light 
<br>
switch, and the incoming signal is your finger, which tries to flick the 
<br>
switch on and off with a steady rhythm. The output signal is the light 
<br>
intensity of a lamp to which the switch is attached. If the signal of 
<br>
your finger is strong, then the output signal is also strong—the light 
<br>
flickers on and off in the same rhythm. But if you have a broken finger 
<br>
and can flick the switch only weakly, you might not be able to move it, 
<br>
in which case no signal will get through. Here is where noise can help.
<br>
<p>Suppose that the switch is slightly noisy, and has a tendency to vibrate 
<br>
although not so vigorously that it would actually flip between on and 
<br>
off by itself. When your broken finger tries to flick this noisy switch, 
<br>
it will occasionally be reinforced by a fortuitous vibration acting in 
<br>
the same direction, and so push the switch over the hump (see Diagram, p 
<br>
38). The noise increases the ability of your finger to make things 
<br>
happen, so at the lamp, there now appears a signal, not a perfectly 
<br>
regular signal, to be sure, but a signal nonetheless, which goes on and 
<br>
off in rough synchrony with your finger.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Triggering a switch using random noise
<br>
<p><p>Breaking waves
<br>
<p>Physicists now know that this two-state switching scenario is just one 
<br>
of many ways in which stochastic resonance can occur. In 1990, physicist 
<br>
Mark Dykman, then at the Institute for Semiconductors in Kiev, Ukraine, 
<br>
realised that stochastic resonance could be brought within the fold of 
<br>
traditional theoretical physics by using something called linear 
<br>
response theory. This provides a simple and general way of describing 
<br>
how a fluctuating system responds to a weak periodic driving force. 
<br>
Using Dykman's ideas, we showed that the conditions under which 
<br>
stochastic resonance arises should occur in just about every noisy 
<br>
nonlinear system you can imagine.
<br>
<p>But stochastic resonance is just one of noise's odd effects. Another 
<br>
occurs in a device known as a stochastic ratchet. Suppose you have some 
<br>
particles trapped in a ratchet-shaped base—some gravel at rest in a 
<br>
strip of corrugated steel, for example, where the corrugations all lean 
<br>
in one direction like breaking waves. Here, it turns out that purely 
<br>
random jiggling of the base can cause the particles all to drift in just 
<br>
one direction. This seems to defy the second law of thermodynamics, 
<br>
since you can extract useful work from seemingly random noise. But it works.
<br>
<p>The trick, as physicist Marcelo Magnasco of Rockefeller University in 
<br>
New York pointed out in 1993, is that the noise has to be &quot;coloured&quot;. 
<br>
The archetype of noise—the kind considered originally by Einstein—is 
<br>
&quot;white&quot; noise, in which each little noisy shock is independent of its 
<br>
predecessors. White noise has no memory. In coloured noise, however, 
<br>
there is a kind of memory at work—a shock that pushes a bit of gravel to 
<br>
the right is more likely to be followed by another similar shock, rather 
<br>
than by one which pushes back to the left. Coloured noise is still 
<br>
random, and ultimately the bits of gravel get little kicks to the left 
<br>
and right in equal proportion. Yet the sequence can conspire with the 
<br>
ratchet to move the particles. The direction of the steady flow can even 
<br>
be changed without altering the ratchet merely by altering the colour of 
<br>
the noise—that is, by changing the pattern in which successive shocks 
<br>
tend to follow one another.
<br>
<p>This mechanism probably lies at the root of how living cells move 
<br>
molecules around. They may also help engineers to build nanoscale 
<br>
motors, able to function in the micro-world where noise rules and 
<br>
conventional engineering techniques fail.
<br>
<p>So physicists have come to understand several ways in which noise can be 
<br>
useful. But is there any way to get inside stochastic resonance, or the 
<br>
workings of a stochastic ratchet, and understand them in the same way 
<br>
that we understand, say, how a clock works, or a car? Think of the noisy 
<br>
switch. Starting from the off position, there are infinitely many 
<br>
possible paths that it could follow in executing a noisy transition from 
<br>
off to on. It could make the change quickly, or vibrate about in the off 
<br>
position for several minutes, and then suddenly hop over to on. Then 
<br>
again, it might just take a slow, gradual noisy walk over the hill 
<br>
between those states. The same goes for a piece of gravel moving from 
<br>
one dip in the corrugated steel to another.
<br>
<p>Wait long enough, and you'll see all these possibilities play out. There 
<br>
is no &quot;one way&quot; that noise can make things happen. But we have found 
<br>
that in practice, almost all of those infinitely many possible motions 
<br>
turns out to be irrelevant to significant events—only a tiny subset 
<br>
really matters. We have also found that by focusing on these special 
<br>
paths, we can understand the workings of noise with just a few simple 
<br>
equations. The important thing, then, is to identify the few pathways 
<br>
that matter.
<br>
<p>The ideas and theoretical results leading to this view of noise have 
<br>
accumulated over decades, stretching back to Einstein and Boltzmann. But 
<br>
in the intervening years, nobody could see how to test things 
<br>
experimentally. The breakthrough came in 1992, when we worked out with 
<br>
Dykman, now at Michigan State University in East Lansing, and Vladim 
<br>
Smelyanskiy, who works at NASA, how to measure and interpret a new 
<br>
physical quantity, the forbiddingly named prehistory probability density.
<br>
<p>The idea is to take some noisy system and monitor its fluctuations, 
<br>
waiting for something rare and dramatic to happen—a flip of the switch, 
<br>
for example. When it does, you examine the immediate prehistory of the 
<br>
system and record exactly how it happened. It's rather like recording, 
<br>
every time you spill the milk, a detailed history of what led up to the 
<br>
event. Doing this over and over, thousands of times, you accumulate 
<br>
information on the histories that are most likely to lead to it. This is 
<br>
the prehistory probability density.
<br>
<p>Large fluctuations
<br>
<p>Our first experiment in 1992 used electronic circuits from which it is 
<br>
easy to record detailed histories and get good data. We didn't drive our 
<br>
circuits—they were in simple equilibrium with their noisy surroundings. 
<br>
One circuit we studied was rather like a switch in that it could be in 
<br>
one of either two stable states. Thermal noise made it vibrate, leading 
<br>
to occasional &quot;large fluctuation&quot; events in which it moved a very long 
<br>
way from a stable state. The experiments verified our ideas: on almost 
<br>
every occasion, the events took place by way of a special pathway, 
<br>
predicted by theory, that mirrored the path by which the system relaxed 
<br>
back to its closest stable state.
<br>
<p>Getting theoretical results for non-equilibrium systems is fundamentally 
<br>
more difficult because that time symmetry. But these systems are among 
<br>
the most important for applications because they are so common, 
<br>
especially in biology. Theory suggested that they must display very 
<br>
complicated behaviour. To study this, we turned again to our switch-like 
<br>
circuit. The state of this circuit is given by a variable q, and its two 
<br>
stable states are q = -1 and q = 1. (You might think of these states as 
<br>
&quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; for a switch.) We started with the circuit in the state 
<br>
at q = -1, and then subjected it to random noise, as well as a regular, 
<br>
oscillating force. This force pushed the circuit out of equilibrium. We 
<br>
then waited for an unusual state to occur.
<br>
<p>Once in a great while, we found it to be in the state q = -0.63, having 
<br>
wandered well away from the stable point q = -1. Every time we found it 
<br>
there, we immediately looked in detail at the events that brought it 
<br>
there. To make things simple, we always took that moment when the system 
<br>
arrived at q = -0.63 as the time t = 0. This was so we could compare a 
<br>
large number of case histories of the same special event, and not get 
<br>
confused by the different times when they occurred (see Diagram, below 
<br>
right).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>The probability density of Noise
<br>
<p>In the diagram, the mountainous heap towards the bottom shows the 
<br>
resulting prehistory probability density. Where many histories pass 
<br>
through a certain point, the mountain is high. Where few histories pass, 
<br>
the mountain is low. The upper plane shows in red dots the location of 
<br>
the mountain's ridges, which first separate and then come together 
<br>
again, giving the mountain the appearance of volcano. The two ridges 
<br>
correspond to the two special paths that the circuit is most likely to 
<br>
follow if it begins near q = -1 and later arrives at q = -0.63. In 
<br>
almost all cases, it is by these two pathways, and these two pathways 
<br>
alone, that the system reaches this particular, unusual state. The upper 
<br>
plane also shows the pattern of special pathways (grey lines) predicted 
<br>
by mathematical theory, which seem to fit our data .
<br>
<p>That's great for us, but will this new understanding of the work habits 
<br>
of noise be of use? We think so. Instead of making our &quot;special event&quot; q 
<br>
= -0.63, for example, we could just as well have made it q = 1, in which 
<br>
case the special pathways would show the circuit's preferred ways of 
<br>
switching from one stable state to the other. Since events like these 
<br>
typically underlie stochastic resonance or the workings of a stochastic 
<br>
ratchet, this theory should make it possible to understand these things 
<br>
in detail, even in complicated problems in the real world.
<br>
<p>Making noise work
<br>
<p>There may be other uses too. Suppose there is some event that you want 
<br>
to happen—a chemical reaction, for example, which is the key step in 
<br>
manufacturing an expensive drug. Random thermal noise will drive the 
<br>
reaction at a certain rate. But you might do better. If you want to 
<br>
speed things up, and follow the most energy-efficient approach, you 
<br>
might try to apply well-designed forces to push the molecules involved 
<br>
along one of the special paths most likely to lead to the reaction. By 
<br>
carefully measuring the chemical system, you should be able to work out 
<br>
the required forces directly. This is exactly what chemist Herschel 
<br>
Rabitz and his collaborators at Princeton University are doing, using 
<br>
lasers to do the &quot;pushing&quot; (see &quot;No toil no trouble&quot;, New Scientist, 18 
<br>
July 1998, p 33).
<br>
<p>The new view on noise could also help in the world of far bigger things. 
<br>
Suppose, say, there is some event you don't want to happen. You might be 
<br>
a physicist who doesn't want the power in your laser to exceed some 
<br>
limit which would destroy it, or guiding a spacecraft or oil tanker, and 
<br>
want to keep it from being driven by random and uncontrollable forces 
<br>
into some dangerous predicament. In principle, you ought to be able to 
<br>
calculate the special paths along which such hazardous fluctuations 
<br>
would be bound to develop. When something ominous does start to happen, 
<br>
you can be ready to apply small corrective forces to steer away from 
<br>
trouble. This approach would be much more efficient and cheaper than 
<br>
applying correction forces all the time, or applying huge forces at the 
<br>
last moment.
<br>
<p>So noise works in a relatively simple way, which we can understand, and 
<br>
even control. In future, we should be able to command noisy systems with 
<br>
the same ease as ordinary machinery. Far from being a disruptive 
<br>
nuisance, it looks as if noise could turn out to be a valuable ally.
