<p>If they read that paragraph all by itself, maybe.

<p>I don't feel a lot of responsibility for people's inability to read

<p><em>&gt; I don't think we have the luxury of assuming that &quot;Friendly AI

<p>I went to great lengths to make it clear that I don't think it's
<br>
very likely at all.  That's why it needs working towards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The advent of nanotechnology does not lead immediately to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm not convinced of that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also: &quot;strong nanotechnology&quot; has in the past denoted any form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molecular manufacturing, whether feedstock-driven or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;free-living&quot;, with &quot;weak nanotechnology&quot; being all the other

</em><br>
<p>Ah.  Do you have other terminology to offer in its place?
<br>
<p>&quot;non-self-replicating nanotech&quot; is a bit of a mothful.  8)
