<em>&gt;From the essay:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;a Friendly AI must be the first being to develop strong nanotech on Earth, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or one of the first, or we are all going to die in a mass of grey goo
</em><br>
<p>Something about this strikes me as wrong-headed. Since
<br>
grey goo is considerably closer in time than Friendly AI,
<br>
an imperative like this will lead people to focus on stopping
<br>
&quot;strong nanotech&quot;, rather than creating Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>I don't think we have the luxury of assuming that &quot;Friendly
<br>
AI before strong nanotech&quot; is very likely. The human race
<br>
will do what it can to minimize the risks and plan for bad
<br>
contingencies, on the model of today's biodefense/biosecurity
<br>
strategies (which address, not just biowarfare, but also
<br>
naturally emerging diseases). The advent of nanotechnology
<br>
does not lead immediately to extinction, and will certainly
<br>
accelerate AI (not necessarily Friendly), because of the
<br>
increased capacity to study and emulate the human brain,
<br>
and the ability to make nanocomputing grids of arbitrary size.
<br>
<p>Also: &quot;strong nanotechnology&quot; has in the past denoted any
<br>
form of molecular manufacturing, whether feedstock-driven
<br>
or &quot;free-living&quot;, with &quot;weak nanotechnology&quot; being all the other
<br>
nanoscale stuff. I think it's one of umpteen terms that
<br>
Foresight has invented in order to distinguish the assembler
<br>
vision from other activities claiming the name of nanotechnology.
