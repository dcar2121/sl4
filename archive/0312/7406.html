<p><em>&gt; Your statement that there is no evidence for the Singularity is a

<p>Right, and that was my point, except you said it much better.  8)

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I know it's fun to write down stuff exactly as it sounds in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; our heads, but with Singularity issues, the wrong presentation
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; important that we present the FAI meme in a way that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; focus on Eliezer so much - even though he originated the idea,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; much emphasis on Eliezer will also make you look like a cult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; victim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Show me someone else that's actually got a coherent general AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; design, then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm... I believe I have a coherent general AI design (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente AI system).  It has not been published but some general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verbiage about it can be found at www.agiri.org
</em><br>
<p>I apologize unreservedly; I don't know why I haven't spent time
<br>
absorbing the agiri.org stuff.  I recall there being a reason, but I
<br>
don't know what it was; it was most likely distraction.  I'll go
<br>
back and give it a better shot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, I believe my AI design is a lot more fully worked out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than Eliezer's is.  So far as I know (my last data point being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I had a long chat with him over dinner a couple months ago),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer really hasn't attempted to formulate a design for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general AI in detail, although he has done a bunch of interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cog. sci. work in this direction.
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://www.intelligence.org/LOGI/">http://www.intelligence.org/LOGI/</a> doesn't count?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I have no attachment to Eliezer himself, but I honestly don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; know anyone else that's doing what he's doing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer is one of a few individuals who are devoting a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their time to exploring the implications of the Singularity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the issue of AI friendliness.  He's not the only one -- Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hibbard is another, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for me, I'm spending only a little of my time on such issues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more of my time on nitty-gritty stuff related to general AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design, as well as on related issues such as using AI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the human organism and how to repair its flaws.
</em><br>
<p>See, that worries me a bit, because if I read you correctly you just
<br>
said you're working an AGI but not really on Friendliness.  That is
<br>
really, really frightening to me.
<br>
<p>I'd actually very much like to see a joint paper between you and
<br>
Eliezer, or even a good e-mail thread, describing the differences
<br>
between your approaches and why you aren't working together.
