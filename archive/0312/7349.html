Noises on
<br>
<p>New Scientist vol 150 issue 2032 - 01 June 96, page Page 28
<br>
<p><p>WHEN Samuel Morse tapped out his first long-distance telegraph message 
<br>
back in 1844, one of his biggest problems was how to detect the signal 
<br>
above the noise caused by static electricity. Today, engineers still do 
<br>
their best to strip such uninvited pops and crackles from their 
<br>
communications. Their ideal is a clean, clear signal as free as possible 
<br>
from interference.
<br>
<p>Like Morse's telegraph, most of life operates in a sea of background 
<br>
noise. In nature, for example, crayfish and crickets have to pick out 
<br>
the sound of approaching predators from a background clatter of 
<br>
irrelevant sounds. In the military, where electronic devices strain to 
<br>
detect the telltale signs of enemy submarines, signal engineers struggle 
<br>
to filter out enough of the background cacophony for the faint signal 
<br>
they are looking for to come through.
<br>
<p>But the suspicion is taking hold that those engineers are on a fool's 
<br>
errand, and that they should be leaving some crackles in. Over the past 
<br>
few years, researchers have discovered that background noise—any 
<br>
unwanted signal interference, from radio buzz to television snow—can 
<br>
actually make it easier to pick up faint signals on the very verge of 
<br>
detection.
<br>
<p>Icy problem
<br>
<p>This extraordinary idea emerged in 1981 in the equally unlikely context 
<br>
of an attempt to explain what was causing the ice ages that cover much 
<br>
of the northern hemisphere with ice every 100 000 years or so. 
<br>
Researchers had noticed that the distance between the Earth and Sun 
<br>
changes on roughly the same timescale—part of a natural wobble in the 
<br>
eccentricity of the Earth's orbit. The obvious explanation is that 
<br>
different amounts of solar radiation reaching the Earth at different 
<br>
times are periodically plunging the Earth into an ice age, and then 
<br>
warming it back up again. But there is a problem: the difference in 
<br>
solar radiation reaching the Earth at opposite ends of the cycle seems 
<br>
much too small to account for the climate changes that occurred.
<br>
<p>So Italian physicists Roberto Benzi, Alfonso Sutera and Angelo Vulpiani 
<br>
wondered whether natural noise might be helping the signal to get 
<br>
through. They suggested that the effects of the Earth's small wobble are 
<br>
boosted by other, shorter-term changes—annual swings in the Earth's 
<br>
retained heat, for instance, or the general variability of climate. The 
<br>
extra noise, the researchers argued, could be enough to boost the weak 
<br>
signal from the wobble, and trigger the ice ages. They called this 
<br>
&quot;stochastic resonance&quot;—stochastic because the noise is essentially 
<br>
random, and resonance because the noise resonates, or works with, the 
<br>
signal to maximise it and push the Earth into a frozen state.
<br>
<p>Neat as this idea seemed, it was never proved, and the concept of 
<br>
stochastic resonance more or less disappeared from view until 1988, when 
<br>
physicists Bruce McNamara, Rajarshi Roy and Kurt Wiesenfeld at the 
<br>
Georgia Institute of Technology demonstrated in a laser experiment that 
<br>
noise really can boost an inherently weak effect. Their experiment used 
<br>
a ring laser, a system in which angled mirrors can direct laser light to 
<br>
travel either clockwise or anticlockwise in a closed loop. The 
<br>
researchers can switch the light's direction using a crystal in the path 
<br>
of the light beam. Most of the laser light goes straight through this 
<br>
crystal, but a small portion is diffracted and veers off the main path. 
<br>
By generating sound waves within the crystal, the researchers were able 
<br>
to change the ratio of diffracted to unaffected light. Eventually, when 
<br>
the sound waves are intense enough and have just the right frequency, 
<br>
the diffraction becomes so strong that the laser light changes direction.
<br>
<p>The researchers then created a faint signal, in the form of a regular 
<br>
variation in the frequency of the sound waves in the crystal. At first 
<br>
they made sure that the signal was too weak to affect the direction of 
<br>
the laser light. Then the team began to add background noise to the 
<br>
signal. As the noise level grew, they found that the light began to 
<br>
switch direction, in step with the signal. At some point the noise 
<br>
became too loud, and the correspondence between the signal and the laser 
<br>
light disappeared.
<br>
<p>So what exactly is happening? After all, adding noise to a system should 
<br>
decrease the chances of detecting the signal you were looking for. Well, 
<br>
a crucial feature of both the ring laser and the ice caps is that they 
<br>
are nonlinear systems. In a linear system, a change in input produces a 
<br>
proportional change in output. Suspend two identical weights from a 
<br>
spring, and it will stretch twice as far as with one. Double the voltage 
<br>
across an electrical resistor and you double the current.
<br>
<p>Nonlinear systems are not like that. A change in the input (a small drop 
<br>
in the amount of heat reaching the Earth, for example) can produce a 
<br>
disproportionate response (a great deal more ice)—and it is in systems 
<br>
like this that stochastic resonance can operate. It is easiest to 
<br>
picture in terms of a threshold below which the signal cannot be 
<br>
detected, or has no effect. It's as if the faint signal surfs on a sea 
<br>
of background noise, hitting random waves that lift it over the system's 
<br>
threshold.
<br>
<p>Stochastic resonance is an attractive concept because noise pervades 
<br>
life, notes Peter McClintock, a physicist at the University of 
<br>
Lancaster. Rather than seek impossible silence, we might learn to live 
<br>
with, and use, the noise around us. Over the past few years, inspired by 
<br>
the demonstration that, in the ring laser, the phenomenon really works, 
<br>
researchers have been hunting for stochastic resonance in all sorts of 
<br>
systems—and now they are starting to find it.
<br>
<p>Neurobiology was an obvious place to start. After all, sensory neurons 
<br>
routinely pick out sights and sounds from a cacophony of background 
<br>
noise. Perhaps, researchers reasoned, the neurons have evolved to use 
<br>
that noise. Sensory neurons encode information in the form of electrical 
<br>
impulses, but the way they respond to stimuli is highly nonlinear: 
<br>
gradual changes in sound or light intensity don't result in a gradual 
<br>
increase in perception. It is more like pulling the trigger of a gun. 
<br>
Squeeze the trigger gently and nothing happens. Only when the pressure 
<br>
is firm enough does the gun fire. External noise enters this picture if 
<br>
you are nervously aiming the gun at an intruder. Your hand probably 
<br>
shakes, adding random tremors to your weak pressure on the trigger. The 
<br>
result: BOOM! The added noise has boosted your weak pressure over the 
<br>
trigger's threshold, and the gun goes off.
<br>
<p>Twitching crayfish
<br>
<p>In the nervous system, electrical charges collect at a neuron until they 
<br>
reach a critical threshold. At that point the neuron fires, sending a 
<br>
message down its body to the next neuron in line. It then resets itself 
<br>
to its resting electrical state, and waits for charge to build up again. 
<br>
The question is, can background noise push feeble signals over the 
<br>
neuron's firing threshold?
<br>
<p>The answer, it seems, is yes. In 1993, physicist Frank Moss and 
<br>
biologist Lon Wilkens from the University of Missouri in St Louis 
<br>
discovered just this effect at work in crayfish. The crayfish's tail fan 
<br>
displays tiny hairs that twitch in response to subtle water movements, 
<br>
like those caused by a predatory fish swimming nearby. When a tail hair 
<br>
twitches, it generates an electrical impulse along a nerve to a neural 
<br>
hub called a ganglion, which processes the impulse, and tells the 
<br>
crayfish to swim away fast.
<br>
<p>In their laboratory, the researchers strung a crayfish hair and its 
<br>
attached nerve to a vibrating post, which was made to vibrate weakly at 
<br>
a frequency similar to that caused by a swimming fish. They then added 
<br>
increasing levels of the sort of random, noisy vibrations that a 
<br>
crayfish might encounter in the surrounding water. Sure enough, as the 
<br>
noise level increased, the crayfish nerve began to pick up and respond 
<br>
to the fishy signals. Eventually, as Moss and Wilkens predicted, the 
<br>
noise level was so high that it began to swamp the signal, and the 
<br>
benefit to the crayfish was lost.
<br>
<p>Though this result showed how noise can help with a nice regular signal, 
<br>
real-world survival can be more challenging. Rather than a hum at a 
<br>
single frequency, most sensory stimuli are isolated and infrequent. 
<br>
Recognising this, researchers are now conducting experiments with 
<br>
irregular signals.
<br>
<p>At the spring meeting of the American Physical Society in St Louis, 
<br>
Missouri, Jacob Levin, a researcher at the University of California in 
<br>
Berkeley, described one such experiment. His subjects were crickets 
<br>
rather than crayfish, but the principle is the same. Like crayfish, 
<br>
crickets use tiny hairs attached to sensory neurons to detect movement 
<br>
in their surroundings. In his lab, Levin exposed crickets to 
<br>
low-amplitude air currents—the signal—amid a background of random, noisy 
<br>
movements. The signal was too weak to trigger the neurons, but the 
<br>
background noise was occasionally high enough to make them fire.
<br>
<p>Using intracellular electrodes, Levin recorded the cricket's neuronal 
<br>
firings as it sensed the air waves. Correlating the neuron output with 
<br>
the weak air currents, Levin could find out how well the cricket 
<br>
detected the faint stimuli. Finally, he measured those responses against 
<br>
the background noise, checking to see how rising noise improved the 
<br>
cricket's signal reception.
<br>
<p>As with the crayfish, noise boosted the cricket's ability to pick up 
<br>
weak signals. &quot;The cricket takes advantage of stochastic resonance to 
<br>
piggyback important small signals on the broadband background noise it 
<br>
can't avoid,&quot; says Levin. But this only worked with noise up to a 
<br>
certain level; if the level of the background noise level was set too 
<br>
high, it simply swamped the signal.
<br>
<p>This raises the question of whether stochastic resonance could be useful 
<br>
for boosting signals with a range of magnitudes—not only those that peak 
<br>
just below the trigger point of the sensor, but also much weaker signals 
<br>
that require more noise to bring them above the threshold. For this to 
<br>
work, the background noise level would have to change to suit the 
<br>
magnitude of the signal, something that is unlikely to happen in the 
<br>
real world. But neurons can still maximise the benefit they get from 
<br>
background noise, according to James Collins, a biomedical engineer at 
<br>
Boston University. As he points out, neurons in living organisms do not 
<br>
operate in isolation, but work as units in a network, reporting to 
<br>
neural hubs such as the ganglion. The theory is that individual neurons 
<br>
have their own intrinsic noise levels, depending on their cellular 
<br>
makeup and connections to other neurons.
<br>
<p>Collins set out to mimic this using a computer model of such a network, 
<br>
and last year he showed that only a minimum noise level—not a changing 
<br>
optimal noise range—is necessary to boost the system's ability to detect 
<br>
a range of signals. Collins and colleagues crafted a network in which 
<br>
neurons received a common weak input signal, but each had a different 
<br>
fixed noise level. The researchers recorded this fixed-noise system's 
<br>
response to a variety of weak input signals. They then compared those 
<br>
responses with a model system lacking noise. Sure enough, the 
<br>
fixed-noise system detected faint signals better than its quiet counterpart.
<br>
<p>Noisy therapy
<br>
<p>Collins says a little noise goes a long way because networks average the 
<br>
output of many components. For a signal of any given size, the chances 
<br>
are that at least some of the neurons in the network will be 
<br>
experiencing the optimum noise level to boost the signal over the 
<br>
threshold without swamping it. So the system can handle signals with a 
<br>
range of magnitudes.
<br>
<p>Encouraged by his findings, Collins hopes to try to use neural noise 
<br>
therapeutically. One target group is people suffering from movement 
<br>
disorders that cause a loss in proprioception—the &quot;sense&quot; that makes it 
<br>
possible to know what your arm is doing, for example, even when you 
<br>
can't see it. In certain people, neurons involved in this process are 
<br>
not as sensitive as they should be: their firing thresholds are set too 
<br>
high. If someone with this disability tries to turn, for example, they 
<br>
may not realise they are twisting an ankle too far—until it breaks.
<br>
<p>One solution might be to add noise to the defective neurons to bring the 
<br>
signals above the neurons' firing threshold. &quot;The challenge is to find a 
<br>
viable way to introduce noise to the human system,&quot; Collins says. One 
<br>
option being considered is for doctors to apply mechanical vibrations to 
<br>
tendons in the ankle. If this works, it could help people suffering from 
<br>
a variety of conditions involving lost sensitivity in touch or balance.
<br>
<p>Getting the picture
<br>
<p>Boosting faint images is another possible use of stochastic resonance 
<br>
being studied by Moss, in conjunction with Enrico Simonotto, a physicist 
<br>
at the University of Genoa in Italy. The researchers have been sitting 
<br>
volunteers in front of TV screens, where they are shown a series of 
<br>
videotaped images. At first, all they are shown is a noise-free image 
<br>
that is too dim to be detected. As the video plays, noise is introduced 
<br>
in the form of random changes to the shade of individual pixels. As the 
<br>
noise increases, Simonotto says, the underlying picture becomes clearer, 
<br>
and most volunteers appear to agree on the range of noise that is most 
<br>
useful for a given picture.
<br>
<p>Simonotto now plans to tinker with the timing and position of noise 
<br>
added to a picture. He suggests that noise-enhanced images may 
<br>
eventually improve visual systems for pilots attempting to find their 
<br>
way in dark or stormy conditions.
<br>
<p>Electronic sensing systems may also benefit from some judiciously added 
<br>
noise. Some physicists hope to use noise in electronic or 
<br>
superconducting systems. Adi Bulsara, a senior scientist at the US Naval 
<br>
Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center in San Diego, is thinking 
<br>
of harnessing the noise that affects some types of magnetic detectors 
<br>
known as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDS). The 
<br>
Navy's SQUIDS are designed to detect enemy submarines, planes and mines 
<br>
by picking up the tiny changes in magnetic field that can be caused, 
<br>
say, by a submarine's power supply.
<br>
<p>One problem with SQUIDs is that the magnetic environment they operate in 
<br>
is full of noise from sources that range from lightning flashes to 
<br>
interference from the Earth's magnetic field. Bulsara noted that some 
<br>
SQUIDS operate as nonlinear two-state systems just like ring lasers. 
<br>
Perhaps, he reasoned, you could use the external noise to push weak 
<br>
signals over the detection threshold. Another possibility, he says, is 
<br>
to link SQUIDs to gain an aggregate boost as for the nervous system.
<br>
<p>There is clearly a lot more that must be learnt about stochastic 
<br>
resonance before many of the proposed applications become reality, as 
<br>
most researchers will readily admit. Some, such as McClintock, fear that 
<br>
enthusiasts may be overselling the phenomenon's direct applications. 
<br>
&quot;How many crickets' lives were saved by the fact that they used 
<br>
stochastic resonance?&quot; Levin asks. &quot;We don't know.&quot; In fact, no one 
<br>
knows whether crayfish and crickets truly use noise, still less whether 
<br>
researchers will ever succeed in finding useful applications of the 
<br>
phenomenon. But the enthusiasts remain optimistic. Noise is everywhere, 
<br>
they argue, so that chances are that nature has found a way to use 
<br>
it—and surely we will, too.
