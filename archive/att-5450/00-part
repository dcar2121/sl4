The continuity is an illusion. Every mental or memory environment I see, I interpret as it happened to me.

There is no way to say, if it was a real event, or it's just a false memory. If I suddenly had all the memories of Julius Cezar, not only that I'd wondered how I came here after being stabbed in the Senate, but J. Cezar would wondered the same.

A broadband technotelepathy with somebody would convince you, that you were (and still are) - also there.

"I" have an access to "my" memories and therefore I conclude - this is I. I have no access to my future memories and still conclude the same. Based on the previous situations, when the future became "my" past. 

If I copied your memories - I would see, that you are the same.

It's one self. "Scattered" around and running in parallel.
