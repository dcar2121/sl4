meant by the term &quot;halting state&quot;.  Generally I believe it means more

like &quot;time to push the reset button&quot;.

</em><br>

</em><br>
Mnnnn.... not precisely what I meant.  I'm saying more that for every
<br>
finite state machine there are only a finite number of states.  This
<br>
includes the results of sensory inputs.  If, then, consciousness is a
<br>
finite state machine, it must eventually (for some meaning of
<br>
eventually) either enter a cycle or so radically change it's nature that
<br>
it becomes a significantly different machine...at which point the cycle
<br>
repeats.  Until at some point the state machine either stops itself or
<br>
is stopped by an external force.
<br>
This argument depends upon two criteria that I've noticed:
<br>
1) that consciousness can be accurately characterized as a state
<br>
machine, and
<br>
2) that consciousness is finite
<br>
Of those, the postulate that appears less certain is that consciousness
<br>
can be accurately characterized as a state machine, and I'm not certain
<br>
what alternatives are reasonable.  (Note that I'm not requiring that it
<br>
*IS* a finite state machine, merely that this is a good model.)
