</em><br>
<p>Duh 1: Accepting mortality isn't the same as wanting death
<br>
Duh 2: An individual human's suicide isn't going to help other species
<br>
a whole lot
<br>
<p>So, although one might accept mortality, the slightest bit of altruism
<br>
(or even benevolence) makes suicide a less-than-ideal path.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>I've long thought it a pity that Transhumanists-in-general put such
<br>
emphasis on staving off death.  An excessive fear of death has long
<br>
seemed to me to be an indicator of... I don't know whether
<br>
&quot;childishness&quot; or &quot;lack of wisdom&quot; is the better way to put it.
<br>
<p>Admittedly, there are sound reasons for wanting to reduce mortality -
<br>
death seriously hampers one's ability to pursue rational goals.  Given
<br>
the amount of time it takes a human to become an expert in a field, it
<br>
doesn't leave much lifespan for anyone to get much use out of being a
<br>
cross field expert.
<br>
<p>But death is not _necessarily_ such a calamity.  Consciousness can be
<br>
enjoyable, but there is nothing intrinsically enjoyable about being
<br>
conscious.  Our motivations towards self-preservation are not the
<br>
result of our consciousness, they are a result of evolution.
<br>
<p>I would gladly sacrifice my subjective consciousness in exchange for a
<br>
significant-enough improvement of the quality of consciousness for
<br>
other people.  If my death could bring on benevolent super-human
<br>
intelligence, I would most certainly want any death-of-mine to be that
<br>
way.  Furthermore, I would prefer that death to a bad life.
<br>
<p>Of course, I'm more likely to bring about better results by staying
<br>
alive - I don't think my estate would go very far.
<br>
<p>I would prefer no life to a life of suffering, and I expect many
<br>
others would too.  I view the suffering that millions+ of conscious
<br>
entities endure daily as a far greater tragedy than the daily deaths
<br>
of millions+ of conscious entities.  Although any &quot;decent&quot; person
<br>
would ideally heal a sick, suffering animal, many would prefer to &quot;put
<br>
down&quot; an animal, rather than let them suffer.
<br>
<p>There are a lot of entities that are conscious enough to suffer, but
<br>
not intelligent enough to have existential issues, or to deliberately
<br>
pursue the benefit of others. There are a lot of apes, most of whom
<br>
are people, who do nothing for others, and very little for themselves
<br>
(and I wish them well). There is tragedy in an altruist joining their
<br>
ranks, just as there is tragedy in an altruist's death.
<br>
<p>There is a huge difference, however, between the death of one person,
<br>
and the destruction of their species.  One person's death, although
<br>
regrettable, makes little impact on -f'rinstance- the development of
<br>
benevolent super-human intelligence.  The destruction of humanity,
<br>
however, would put quite a dampener on the pursuit  of significant
<br>
goals like that.  The mass suicide of all humans this afternoon would
<br>
also not be likely to bring about better long-term outcomes for
<br>
non-humans, either.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>I would hope that more transhumanists would come to better terms with
<br>
death - for one thing, it can make life more enjoyable to rationally
<br>
remove fears.  I would hope that more people would pursue
<br>
transhumanist goals for benevolent reasons, rather than for selfishly
<br>
getting to enjoy the post-singularity spoils.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, I'm happy enough for the selfish to act in
<br>
pragmatically benevolent ways, such as by funding life-extension
<br>
research.
