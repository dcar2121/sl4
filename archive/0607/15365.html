<em>&gt;Schmidhuber's OOPS, if I recall correctly, supposedly has no invariants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at all. If you can prove the new code has &quot;greater expected utility&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;according to the current utility function (even if the new code includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;changes to the utility function), and taking into account all changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that will be adopted by the new code, the new code gets adopted. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Schmidhuber is very vague about exactly how this proof takes place.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;My own thinking tends to the idea of a preserved optimization target,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preserved preferences over outcomes, rather than protected bits in memory.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  This would seem to involve
<br>
a) an arbitrary departure from optimality, including from flexibility and 
<br>
potential for compromise should other SIs be encountered.  Optimization 
<br>
target changes may be part of the cooperative strategy in prisoners dillemas 
<br>
and the like.
<br>
b) Possibly a cap on the realization of positive (and negative admittedly) 
<br>
values which are not encompassed in the inital optimization target but which 
<br>
could emerge naturally without competing with the initial target.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure that concept b) is valid, see arguments against its validity, 
<br>
and see resemblences between it and the concept of objective morality, but 
<br>
it does seem to me that a) is definitely a valid concern
<br>
<p>OTOH, if preserved optimization targets are much technically simpler to 
<br>
implement than the OOPS concept, which as you say suffers from vagueness, 
<br>
that might be a reason to take risks with its long-term viability in cosmic 
<br>
scale prisoners dillemas etc.
