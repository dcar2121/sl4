</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huhhh?!
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The mutability of goals is something important, IMO, but I am not sure I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can make sense of your point in this essay.  Maybe you lost sight of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your initial goal?
</em><br>
<p>Well, the examples from my past are NOT the point.  What my goal-goals
<br>
were at 14 is not the point, and whether I have so far &quot;satisfied&quot;
<br>
those goal-goals is immaterial.
<br>
<p>The fact that I can only think of a single incident where I have set
<br>
myself goal-goals is used as anecdotal support for my contention that
<br>
humanpeople don't work that way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And besides, I love the French for being so ..... French.  They got such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a darling culture!
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly the kind of viewpoint that 14yo Olie didn't ever want
<br>
future Olies to adopt.  But as I said, this is immaterial.
<br>
<p>(If you _really_ want, we can discuss off-group.)
<br>
<p>Also, responding to Joshua Fox,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; the goals that are human universals tend to be those that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are more obviously preserved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are a few goals built into our genes.  Humans have the unique
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bility to set higher-level goals, but this is a shallow, recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolved ability, and often breaks down, especially in the face of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built-in goals. That's why it is so hard to diet.
</em><br>
<p>Yup, the built-in goals are powerful.  Which makes it easy to preserve
<br>
built-in goals.
<br>
<p>(Again, my &quot;point&quot; is a bit obscure, which, combined with my odd way
<br>
of putting things, tends to lead to furiousness without disagreement)
