What good is there in outliving all the stars in the universe?  What good is
<br>
there in dying before you have to?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>There is a fine line between humility and acquiescence.  The one is a
<br>
necessary check against unfettered hubris; the other is what keeps sentient
<br>
beings just a step above beasts.  What you call humility sounds to me a lot
<br>
like acquiescence.  Why not accept your limited time on the stage,
<br>
especially when there's another showing right after the matinee?  Because
<br>
transhumanists aren't just rehashing All's Well That Ends Well, we're hoping
<br>
to write the sequel.  You may be comforted by a universe of endless
<br>
repetition.  I certainly am not, and I have a good life.  G-d help those
<br>
doomed to an endless repetition of a life of pain and suffering, not to
<br>
mention war and holocaust.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Is there a limit to our transcendent status?  Who knows?  Why did we ever
<br>
leave the caves?  Why did we invent writing?  Why go to school?  The answers
<br>
seem so obvious to me that the questions seem silly.  We are beings with
<br>
innate curiosity and a hunger for knowledge.  As long as there is more to
<br>
know there is reason to keep the play going.  I don't know the limits of
<br>
human and post-human potential, but I do know the limits of those who don't
<br>
try.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>You wrote:  &quot;Even if I could create or destroy universes at will, that still
<br>
would not make me G-d.  Extremely intelligent-- yes.  Extremely powerful --
<br>
yes.  But still not G-d.&quot;  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Perhaps not, but it would sure make you a hell of a lot more *relevant* than
<br>
G-d to the inhabitants of those universes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>You wrote:  &quot;The best answer that I can come up with for justifying infinite
<br>
transcendence is that it would be fun!  What other purpose is there once
<br>
you've crossed the boundary of all necessity?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>What is the purpose of *anything* once you cross the boundary of *bare*
<br>
necessity?  Maybe &quot;fun&quot; is the only purpose.  Maybe it's just a by-product.
<br>
I'm no great philosopher, but I do know that life, if nothing else, is
<br>
evolution and survival.  Maybe &quot;fun&quot; is the reward for those who evolve and
<br>
survive the best.  Death and endless repetition, while maybe my ultimate
<br>
fate, sound hellish enough to at least try to avoid.  And if we can't avoid
<br>
being a re-run, then we should darn well make our episode a pleasurable one.

Subject: Re: CNN article with Bostrom interview and Kurzweil quotes
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Yes.  ACCEPTING mortality.  I don't expect love or even rationality.  In
<br>
fact, I don't expect any response.  What good is there in outliving all the
<br>
stars in the universe?
<br>
<p>There is an infinite holonic depth to knowledge. The question is: &quot;What is
<br>
useful within the boundary and constraints of quasi-finite existence?&quot;  I
<br>
personally accept that my particular energy pattern which constitutes
<br>
&quot;me-ness&quot; is replicable given time, space, physics, and evolution, etc. And
<br>
that I may not be the first organization of &quot;me&quot; in time given the
<br>
combinatorial possibilites over an infinite expanse.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Should our goal be infinite transcendence or humility in quasi-finite
<br>
beingness.  That question seems to be a critical underlying theme to the
<br>
singularity movement and its opponents.  I don't need to be an infinite
<br>
transcendent being unto myself when I accept that I am already a finite
<br>
aspect of an infinitely transcendent being whose modality will reoccur in an
<br>
infinite manner across an infinite expanse of space and time.  Would it
<br>
matter if I can not recall or have an awareness of everytime my specific
<br>
pattern of energy evolved into being?  I don't have perfect recollection of
<br>
every moment I have experienced in this particular evolution!  But being
<br>
that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but changes phase states,
<br>
there is a recombinant certainty that over the expanse of infinite time or
<br>
infinitely parallel time that my energy pattern will repeat itself just like
<br>
any prime aspect of an infinite continuum.
<br>
<p>I guess I am simply comfortable with being a prime aspect of consciousness
<br>
with the certainty of replication at some distant and/or past point in time
<br>
with an infinite potential of replication.  Hence 'death' as we perceive it
<br>
is a discrete step in a continual (i.e. not continuous) manifestation of
<br>
being.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Is there a limit to our transcendent status?  Would having the ability to
<br>
create or destroy universes at whim be enough to satisfy our egos?  Is there
<br>
a limit to perceivable awareness, i.e. at what point in the holon of the
<br>
mandelbrot set does the picture become inperceivable or just plain useless?
<br>
Can I be happy with a knowledge of how to live in complete harmony with
<br>
absolute chaos?  Or maybe limited harmony with limited chaos? How much is
<br>
enough?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I keep repeating the question in different ways because I want to be clear
<br>
to most anyone capable of understanding that the people on this list are
<br>
capable, within my estimation, of realizing a technologically limitless
<br>
future where our transcendent power would be near limitless; but to what
<br>
end?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Even if I could create or destroy universes at will, that still would not
<br>
make me G-d.
<br>
<p>Extremely intelligent-- yes.  Extremely powerful -- yes.  But still not G-d.
<br>
<p>The best answer that I can come up with for justifying infinite
<br>
transcendence is that it would be fun!  What other purpose is there once
<br>
you've crossed the boundary of all necessity?
