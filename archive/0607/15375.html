Olie,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although some wants and desires (eg:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food, shelter, pleasure…) generally remain unchanged throughout their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lives – the conspicuousness of the exceptions make their rarity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent – the goals that are human universals tend to be those that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are more obviously preserved.
</em><br>
<p>These are a few goals built into our genes.  Humans have the unique
<br>
ability to set higher-level goals, but this is a shallow, recently
<br>
evolved ability, and often breaks down, especially in the face of the
<br>
built-in goals. That's why it is so hard to diet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; marriage.
</em><br>
Marriage is, again,  an attempt  to to enforce higher level goals in
<br>
an area which has to do with reproducing the genes -- and so the
<br>
built-in goals are very strong.  The override is carried out in
<br>
various cultures by a combination of personal choice and societal
<br>
pressure. Again, this is hard to pull off successfully.
<br>
<p>There are other examples of enforcing a goal on one's future self.
<br>
Some ancient members of celibate religious orders castrated
<br>
themselves. Alcoholics take a drug that makes them sick when they
<br>
drink. Dieters go to a spa far away from temptation.
<br>
<p>As you point out, an RPOP is different. A RPOP can have any
<br>
&quot;built-in&quot; goal it is given and can presumably (if it wants to, which
<br>
it probably does not) set its own built-in goals as well as
<br>
higher-level ones.
<br>
<p>Joshua
