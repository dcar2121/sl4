</em><br>
<em>&gt; The amount of computer power does not matter, sure. What matters, though, is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of resources needed to create AGI software. Google (or IBM or Microsoft) has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough resources to enter the AGI race late and still win easily.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah -- *if* they can solve the (hard) problem of keeping their
<br>
innovative edge... and if they decide to focus some of their resources
<br>
on AGI instead of search and such...
<br>
<p>In recent decades, not that many big software innovations have come
<br>
out of big company research labs. Startups and universities have been
<br>
the innovators, and then big companies have bought their
<br>
innovations...
<br>
<p>Google started with some great innovation but they were a startup
<br>
then.  Their recent business success has been based on clever product
<br>
introductions not deep technical innovation.  It remains to be seen if
<br>
they can escape the Big Company Curse (to which M$ seems to currently
<br>
be succumbing)... even if they get interested in AGI in a more
<br>
fundamental way than they are now, this &quot;curse&quot; (which is really a
<br>
complex of psychosocial factors) may prevent them from hosting the
<br>
fundamental breakthroughs...
<br>
<p>Digging a little deeper...
<br>
As many on this list know, I believe I have a viable design for an AGI
<br>
(the Novamente AGI system) --- and this design tells me several
<br>
things, such as:
<br>
<p>a) there are probably a lot of other viable AGI designs too
<br>
<p>b) however, creating a viable AGI design is quite hard
<br>
<p>c) creating a viable AGI design requires a lot of work that is
<br>
different from work on narrow AI problems (such as NLP)
<br>
<p>d) implementing and testing and teaching an AGI system is a lot of
<br>
work separate from narrow AI work (such as NLP)
<br>
<p>Whether Google is going to put $$ into AGI research, and provide the
<br>
right environment for AGI innovation, remains to be seen.  If I am
<br>
right about points b-d, AGI is not just going to emerge from their
<br>
work in information retrieval and natural language processing.
