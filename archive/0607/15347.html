<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why we're more scared of gay marriage and terrorism than a much  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deadlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Daniel Gilbert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Daniel Gilbert is a professor of psychology at Harvard University and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the author of &quot;Stumbling on Happiness,&quot; published in May by Knopf.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; July 2, 2006
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NO ONE seems to care about the upcoming attack on the World Trade  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Center
</em><br>
<em>&gt; site. Why? Because it won't involve villains with box cutters.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will involve melting ice sheets that swell the oceans and turn that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular block of lower Manhattan into an aquarium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The odds of this happening in the next few decades are better than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odds that a disgruntled Saudi will sneak onto an airplane and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detonate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shoe bomb. And yet our government will spend billions of dollars this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year to prevent global terrorism and ... well, essentially nothing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent global warming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why are we less worried about the more likely disaster? Because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain evolved to respond to threats that have four features -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; features that terrorism has and that global warming lacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, global warming lacks a mustache. No, really. We are social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammals whose brains are highly specialized for thinking about others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Understanding what others are up to - what they know and want, what  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are doing and planning - has been so crucial to the survival of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species that our brains have developed an obsession with all things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human. We think about people and their intentions; talk about them;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for and remember them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why we worry more about anthrax (with an annual death toll of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly zero) than influenza (with an annual death toll of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quarter-million to a half-million people). Influenza is a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accident, anthrax is an intentional action, and the smallest action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captures our attention in a way that the largest accident doesn't. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two airplanes had been hit by lightning and crashed into a New York
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skyscraper, few of us would be able to name the date on which it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Global warming isn't trying to kill us, and that's a shame. If climate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change had been visited on us by a brutal dictator or an evil empire,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the war on warming would be this nation's top priority.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The second reason why global warming doesn't put our brains on orange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alert is that it doesn't violate our moral sensibilities. It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause our blood to boil (at least not figuratively) because it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force us to entertain thoughts that we find indecent, impious or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repulsive. When people feel insulted or disgusted, they generally do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something about it, such as whacking each other over the head, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voting. Moral emotions are the brain's call to action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Although all human societies have moral rules about food and sex, none
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a moral rule about atmospheric chemistry. And so we are outraged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about every breach of protocol except Kyoto. Yes, global warming is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it doesn't make us feel nauseated or angry or disgraced, and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't feel compelled to rail against it as we do against other  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; momentous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threats to our species, such as flag burning. The fact is that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; climate change were caused by gay sex, or by the practice of eating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kittens, millions of protesters would be massing in the streets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The third reason why global warming doesn't trigger our concern is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we see it as a threat to our futures - not our afternoons. Like all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals, people are quick to respond to clear and present danger,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is why it takes us just a few milliseconds to duck when a wayward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baseball comes speeding toward our eyes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The brain is a beautifully engineered get-out-of-the-way machine that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constantly scans the environment for things out of whose way it should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now get. That's what brains did for several hundred million  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - and then, just a few million years ago, the mammalian brain  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new trick: to predict the timing and location of dangers before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our ability to duck that which is not yet coming is one of the brain's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most stunning innovations, and we wouldn't have dental floss or 401(k)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plans without it. But this innovation is in the early stages of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development. The application that allows us to respond to visible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baseballs is ancient and reliable, but the add-on utility that  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to respond to threats that loom in an unseen future is still in beta
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We haven't quite gotten the knack of treating the future like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present it will soon become because we've only been practicing for  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million years. If global warming took out an eye every now and then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OSHA would regulate it into nonexistence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a fourth reason why we just can't seem to get worked up about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global warming. The human brain is exquisitely sensitive to changes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light, sound, temperature, pressure, size, weight and just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else. But if the rate of change is slow enough, the change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will go undetected. If the low hum of a refrigerator were to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pitch over the course of several weeks, the appliance could be singing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soprano by the end of the month and no one would be the wiser.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because we barely notice changes that happen gradually, we accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradual changes that we would reject if they happened abruptly. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; density of Los Angeles traffic has increased dramatically in the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few decades, and citizens have tolerated it with only the obligatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grumbling. Had that change happened on a single day last summer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Angelenos would have shut down the city, called in the National Guard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and lynched every politician they could get their hands on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Environmentalists despair that global warming is happening so fast. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, it isn't happening fast enough. If President Bush could jump  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time machine and experience a single day in 2056, he'd return to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present shocked and awed, prepared to do anything it took to solve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem..
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The human brain is a remarkable device that was designed to rise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special occasions. We are the progeny of people who hunted and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathered,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose lives were brief and whose greatest threat was a man with a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stick.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When terrorists attack, we respond with crushing force and firm  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as our ancestors would have. Global warming is a deadly threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely because it fails to trip the brain's alarm, leaving us  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soundly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asleep in a burning bed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It remains to be seen whether we can learn to rise to new occasions.
