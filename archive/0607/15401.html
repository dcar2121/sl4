I think you hit upon the crux of the matter -- what will we do without problems or necessity?  I believe we would have to continuously invent new ways of having &quot;fun&quot;. Or rather, creating significantly more complex problem states so that the time between halts increases.  It seems that in every engineering problem I run into, I am always trying to achieve some state of control -- a steady state. Once there, I move on to another problem.  This is the meaning of my life.  I wonder what will happen if all of the problems presented to me became iteratively trivial. So trivial that my ability to notice and solve a problem; even predict and solve a problem before it ever manifested itself would approach an asymptotic time interval of zero.  I would experience continuous halting states so much so that the halting states themselves would seem continuous.  Through iterative learning and continuous self-improvement, the probability of error in my predicting future problems should
<br>
&nbsp;also approach zero.  I guess a better question is &quot;Are there an infinite number of non-trivial classes of problems?&quot;  Without a problem set what's the point? You permanently halt in a state of bliss and all knowingness?  At that point, I would hope to be intelligent enough to create new problems.  The funny part is I would seamlessly solve them while creating them.  Ultimately, an uber me would need to create an intractable holonic problem with which I would attempt to solve level by complex level in order to keep from being bored.  I would create new constraints, and limitations in order to prevent boredom. I would continuously create new classes of problems.  I would have the G-d dilema.  If I could ever approach this level of reality.  I think I could make G-d laugh really hard!

<p>You will probably be interested in a book that Charles Stoss is working
<br>
on. It's working title is &quot;Halting State&quot;.
<br>
<p>I, personally, expect that there is a finite amount of extension that is
<br>
reasonable for any particular person. I also suspect that it's not the
<br>
same for all. Of course, my suspicion is on very poor footing,
<br>
evidentially speaking. The current evidence is basically that when
<br>
people's bodies start breaking down in ways that they believe to be
<br>
irreversible, they tend to lose interest in keeping them going. Mine is
<br>
just a suspicion that any state machine will eventually end up in either
<br>
a loop or a halting state. And that if you notice the loop, you'll
<br>
eventually choose to get out of it. So if you are intelligent enough to
<br>
notice the loops you get into, you'll eventually arrive at a halting state.
<br>
<p>Now as to whether this would occur before or after the last star has
<br>
died... I don't see this specified by the problem conditions, so I
<br>
expect a variability in the responses. A question that is to me more
<br>
interesting is &quot;would these minds see merger as a viable option?&quot; (Think
<br>
Spock's mind meld made permanent.) If some trans-human entity has a
<br>
stronger &quot;theory of mind&quot; of your mind than *you* do, can you die
<br>
without it being willing to allow it's model to terminate? (I.e., what
<br>
do you mean &quot;I&quot;.) Etc.
