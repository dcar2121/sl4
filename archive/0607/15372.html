<p>
Summary of 1600 words: &quot;we&quot; rarely deliberately set goals as goals.
<br>
When we seem to, we seem to suck at it, which leads to doubts about
<br>
FAI safety.  Explicitly showing the difference between this aspect of
<br>
human minds and potential RPOP design may improve &quot;public perception&quot;
<br>
of Seed-AIs.
<br>
<p>== Intro ==
<br>
<p>It's almost an aphorism that humanpeople by default expect all
<br>
intelligent beings to behave roughly as they do.
<br>
<p>So, humanpeople will typically judge
<br>
Really-Powerful-Optimisation-Processes' capacities to preserve goals
<br>
across changes in intelligence on their experience with humans.
<br>
<p>In my experience, humanpeople are conspicuously bad at preserving
<br>
goals.  I would guess that most folks would also think that
<br>
humanpeople are people don't have a good track record with goal
<br>
preservation.
<br>
<p>Lots of people expect that they will feel a certain way for their
<br>
entire lives, and then change.  Although some wants and desires (eg:
<br>
food, shelter, pleasure…) generally remain unchanged throughout their
<br>
lives – the conspicuousness of the exceptions make their rarity
<br>
apparent – the goals that are human universals tend to be those that
<br>
are more obviously preserved.
<br>
<p>== Deliberate goal preservation ==
<br>
<p>What examples are there of deliberate goal preservation?  &quot;Preserving
<br>
goals&quot; is not something that people tend to go about in a deliberate
<br>
and conscious manner.
<br>
<p>Generally, people will want to pursue goals either for their own sake,
<br>
or they expect to pursue them for reasons that they will endorse in
<br>
the
<br>
<p>It sounds odd to say &quot;I want to want chocolate&quot;.  If you don't
<br>
actually like chocolate, why would you have a desire to want
<br>
chocolate?  If you like chocolate today, why would you have any desire
<br>
to want chocolate tomorrow for reasons that you only held today?
<br>
<p>Hell, why would you expect to dislike chocolate tomorrow if you like it today?
<br>
<p>It's just not the way that we normally go about setting goals.
<br>
<p>== The example of Lurrve ==
<br>
<p>One notable area where people do make a conscious effort to preserve
<br>
goals is romantic relationships – love and marriage.
<br>
<p>We have collectively recognised that some preferences that humans have
<br>
a tend to change with time, and that there might be reasons for
<br>
wanting not to change those preferences.
<br>
<p>Put simply: it's (thought to be) good for the kiddies if mummy and
<br>
daddy preserve their preference for each other.
<br>
<p>Consequently, we have an example where people say that they preserve
<br>
their goal of liking each other.  Let me paraphrase a wedding vow:
<br>
<p>&quot;I like you now, so I currently have the goals of living with you and
<br>
making you happy.  I _promise_ to like you in the future, and I
<br>
promise that in future I will have the goals of living with you and
<br>
making you happy.   I am implying that my current goals include having
<br>
the future goals of liking you, living with you, and making you
<br>
happy.&quot;
<br>
<p>If we accept that people, when getting married, really do have the
<br>
goal of goal preservation – that is, of having and maintaining the
<br>
future goals of liking, living together, and making each other happy,
<br>
then we have a pretty clear example of failure of goal preservation
<br>
being fairly widespread.
<br>
<p>How widespread?  Well, &quot;western&quot; marriages break up willy-nilly, and
<br>
although many other countries don't have the divorce rate of the west,
<br>
a reasonable proportion of marriages only keep the promise of living
<br>
together.  Their success at preserving any sort of &quot;romantic&quot;
<br>
connexion is considerably lower.
<br>
<p>However, I'm not so sure that when people form romantic relationships,
<br>
or even enter into marriage, that they are making any deliberate
<br>
effort to preserve goals.  Although marriage vows typically involve
<br>
various promises to do stuff, I suspect many people think more along
<br>
the lines of &quot;My goal is to do stuff in the future&quot;, rather than &quot;my
<br>
goal is to have the future goals of doing stuff&quot;.
<br>
<p>Of course, if those people don't do anything to ensure that their
<br>
future selves have the goal of doing X, they may not have the
<br>
motivation to actually do X when the time comes – that is, they've
<br>
lost the motivation to do what they had previously wanted to do.  Of
<br>
course, they might still have the goal &quot;fulfil promises&quot;, but that's
<br>
an entirely different reason for remaining in a marriage-like
<br>
relationship.
<br>
<p>== Other promises ==
<br>
<p>As I've said, it's pretty unusual to have a goal-goal, or to promise
<br>
to have a set of goals. Far more common is the goal of pursuing an
<br>
activity, promising to engage in an activity, or promising to deliver
<br>
an outcome.
<br>
<p>I can think of only one example from my past:  When I was fourteen, I
<br>
made a mental note to myself that my fourteen-year old self would
<br>
despise my older self if I: 1. Pursued an existence without an impact
<br>
(that is, lived just coz I was living) 2. Cut
<br>
my hair off without good reason (business conformity not being one,
<br>
given that my whole reason for wanting long hair was ) 3. Liked the
<br>
French for being French (culture envy is often stupid, and
<br>
Francophilia is one of the more prevalent forms of culture envy).
<br>
<p>Now, the factoid that's most obvious from these is that I was a
<br>
disturbed little boy, but what I read into this is that I recognised
<br>
that my goals and preferences would likely change as I got older, and
<br>
that there was little I could do except say: &quot;These are my values, and
<br>
if you don't share them, I disrespect you.&quot; However, I also recognised
<br>
that if my future self didn't share the same goals, that I'd probably
<br>
care more about my current goals than that about the fact that some
<br>
brat disrespected me.
<br>
<p>Regardless, I didn't see the mental note as a mechanism for actually
<br>
ensuring that my future self actually had those goals.  I only made
<br>
this mental note because I expected that my goals would change.
<br>
<p>Another area where people sometimes stipulate what goals a
<br>
future-entity &quot;should&quot; have is in government.  For instance, in saying
<br>
that future government entities should pursue the goals of, say,
<br>
increasing public transport patronage to 50% of trips.  Statements are
<br>
seemingly made like that because the current governmental body has no
<br>
hope of meeting the objective during their current tenure, so they
<br>
pass the buck.  However, they recognise that the future body might
<br>
inherently have different goals, so they put together a report, saying
<br>
why the future body should have those particular goals.
<br>
<p>Uh… the point is… um… anyway,
<br>
<p>== Our ability to create future mind states varies. ==
<br>
<p>If I say &quot;I want my future mind state to have the ability juggle&quot;, I
<br>
can go about learning juggling techniques, leading to having that mind
<br>
state.  If my goal is to have the mind-state of being well-rested
<br>
tomorrow, I can try to get to bed early tonight.  If my goal is to be
<br>
less irritable this afternoon than yesterday afternoon, I can make a
<br>
decent meal to keep my blood sugar levels steady, and avoid stressful
<br>
activities.  If my goal is to remember a phone number, I can recite
<br>
that number to the tune of a catchy melody as I move my arms in the
<br>
relative directions of the numerical keypad.  If my goal is to be
<br>
happy 30 seconds from now, I can tense the muscles in my zygomatic
<br>
arches and consider fond memories J.
<br>
<p>Each of these actions is susceptible to failure.  I can try to learn
<br>
to juggle, but I might be too klutzy.  I can go to bed early, but my
<br>
neighbours might try out their fancy new jackhammer.  I can avoid
<br>
stressful planning activities, but I can't prevent receiving a summons
<br>
about &quot;those charges&quot;.  I can use spatial-relation memory techniques,
<br>
but can't preclude concussion.  I can smile and reminisce fondly, but
<br>
not if someone drops a piano on my foot.
<br>
<p>So, yeah, action towards the future is never infallible (duh), so it
<br>
would be impossible to &quot;prove&quot; that an action would result in any
<br>
particular future state.  All one can do is model and predict.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, we have a reasonable ability to ensure certain future
<br>
mind states.  Some are much harder than others, and physiological
<br>
factors can be damn important.  Nonetheless, humanpeople's ability to
<br>
ensure mind-states like, for instance, knowing a phone number, can
<br>
have a pretty high rate of success.
<br>
<p>== &quot;Proving&quot; the ability of an RPOP to preserve goals ==
<br>
<p>Because predicting the future is never &quot;likely&quot; to be infallible, it
<br>
would be silly to try and _prove_ that an AI of any variety could ever
<br>
preserve its goals.  However, just as it is possible to &quot;show&quot; or
<br>
&quot;model&quot; that a system has a very high success rate of remembering a
<br>
number string when you implement lots of redundancies, I should think
<br>
the same would be possible for a system's ability to preserve its
<br>
goals.
<br>
<p>I don't know if anyone has defined what a goal /is/ well enough for
<br>
someone to model goal preservation in this way.
<br>
<p>Would anyone have an intellectual issue with trusting a highly
<br>
optimised system to remember a number string?  I doubt it, although
<br>
emotional issues might arise.
<br>
<p>Would anyone have an issue with setting an optimisation process to
<br>
remember a number string?  Well, I'd personally object to being
<br>
computroniumised to ensure that a computer never forgets a phone
<br>
number, but I would expect that setting an RPOP to remember a phone
<br>
number would be unlikely to result in the RPOP changing its goals so
<br>
that it didn't have to remember that phone number.
<br>
<p>If an Optimisation Process with the goal of remembering a
<br>
number-string can alter its code, would one ever expect it to change
<br>
its code in a way that decreased its ability to remember that string?
<br>
<p>So why would we expect an Optimisation Process to change its code in a
<br>
way that decreased its ability to pursue its goals?
<br>
<p>I can't model this, either way.  I can only intuit.
