I see continuity as an illusion. Not self - as many do see self as an illusion - I see the continuity of the self as an illusion.

Quite a difference.

I can upload myself:

 - A - with all my memories
 
 - B - with some of my memories
  
 - C - with no memories at all 
   
 - D - with the memories of somebody else
 
In _all_ those cases - I am upladed. Most people think, that A and maybe B are only enough. That the continuity of the self is preserved (only) this way.

I postulate one self - not many selves. Many instances of it, however.

It's not my main problem, that I am not uploaded yet. The even bigger is, that I may already be transloaded all around. Having an illusion of being only there. That a continuity is going on, _there_ and only there.

A broader bandwidth of communication should make that clear.
