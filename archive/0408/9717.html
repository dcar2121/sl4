<p>Goodstein(4) returns to 0 after (3*2^402653211 - 3) steps.  With a bit of 
<br>
epistemological handwaving and questionable (i.e. wrong) priors you could 
<br>
apply the Rule of Succession to arrive at a confidence, after one billion 
<br>
steps, that the next *single* step was unlikely to halt, the confidence in 
<br>
halting being 1/1,000,000,002 or less.  But the Rule of Succession is 
<br>
entirely *agnostic* about the confidence that Goodstein(4) *never* halts, 
<br>
ever, even after a quadrillion observations - and in fact Goodstein(4) does 
<br>
halt.
<br>
<p>It may seem reasonable to say that since the Peano axioms have been 
<br>
extensively tested and have never yet produced a contradiction, therefore 
<br>
they probably never will.  Actually, *all* the Rule of Succession gives you 
<br>
is a high confidence that the next *particular* result published in some 
<br>
math journal will not be a reductio of PA.  But to claim that PA never 
<br>
produces a contradiction *ever* is something wholly unjustified by the 
<br>
evidence available to us, at least on the Rule of Succession.
<br>
<p>A quintillion observations may seem like a lot of evidence, but to 
<br>
generalize from there to infinity is unjustified.  Practically all finite 
<br>
numbers are larger than than those in your sample set.  There are just too 
<br>
many empirical observations in math that hold true for 3 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 64 -&gt; 2 
<br>
steps and then break at 3 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 65 -&gt; 2.  For example, the test:  &quot;Is X 
<br>
less than Graham's number?&quot;
<br>
<p>Contemporary Bayesian math will let you reason from a huge mound of 
<br>
empirical evidence to a high confidence in the next single case, but *not* 
<br>
to an infinite case or a universal generalization - which, when you think 
<br>
about it, is common sense.  Come to think, I haven't seen this pointed out 
<br>
anywhere, but it seems obvious enough.
<br>
<p>Laplace originally used the Rule of Succession to derive that if the sun 
<br>
has risen for 2,000,000 consecutive mornings, then the naive confidence of 
<br>
the sun rising tomorrow is 2,000,001/2,000,002.  But despite taking into 
<br>
account six orders of magnitude more evidence (Laplace reasoned on the last 
<br>
5000 years), my own confidence would be at least two orders of magnitude 
<br>
lower (implied if the Sun seems at least 25% likely to be switched off in 
<br>
the next 50 years), and we all know it's going to fail eventually.  The 
<br>
thing about a Bayesian confidence is that it's designed on the assumption 
<br>
of being occasionally wrong.
