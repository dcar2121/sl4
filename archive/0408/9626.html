It takes quite a bit of teasing out to clarify what is meant by a
<br>
statement like &quot;the universe is a manifestation of mathematics&quot;.  
<br>
IMHO, it would be more accurate to say something like that reality
<br>
interacts and manifests in ways that we can describe via mathematics -
<br>
a grasping for the &quot;orderliness&quot; or &quot;algorithm-like&quot; nature.   Saying
<br>
it is a manifestation of mathematics seems to go much further than
<br>
this.   One could as well say &quot;only information exists&quot; or as a
<br>
variant, &quot;reality is virtual&quot;.    Some very interesting arguments can
<br>
be and have been made for such, but all of the provide a shaky
<br>
foundation for a philosophical system to rest upon.
<br>
<p>While Geddes did not call it an axiom it is the basis of his
<br>
Metaphysics so it stands in the place where one would expect an axiom.
<br>
<p>That mathematics has empirical suitability is not really astonishing
<br>
at all.  Mathematics is a formal way of stating/capturing algorithms,
<br>
relationships and regularities.  It will map to any system containing
<br>
relationships and regularities.   Math is the abstraction of the way
<br>
logically coherent systems work.  If it did not map well to the
<br>
Universe then the Universe would be incoherent chaos.   That it isn't
<br>
doesn't make it permissible to claim that such coherence itself is a
<br>
manifestation of the abstraction for expressing, capturing,
<br>
manipulating coherent algorithms and relationships..

<em>&gt; &gt; like &quot;All reality is a manifestation of pure mathematics&quot; qualify?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What do you mean by &quot;pure mathematics&quot; and &quot;manifestation&quot; in that

<em>&gt; &gt; incredible construct?  For a philosophical system the starting axioms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be irreducible, not general conclusions, hypothesis or theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't claim to know how or why it is so, but it seems obvious enough that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our physical universe is a manifestation of that which we name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mathematics&quot; - maybe even in the sense of our physical universe being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model which satisfies an axiomatic system, but I'm still studying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical logic so it's too early for me to speculate coherently about that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geddes credits the speculation that all is math and all math exists to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tegmark, Geddes didn't make it up himself.  Nor did Tegmark devise it; if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall correctly &quot;all is math&quot; goes back to Pythagoras, and I don't know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who first speculated that everything exists.  I agree that a statement like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;all is number&quot; is unsuitable for use as an axiom, but Geddes did not call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it an axiom.  It would only be an &quot;axiom&quot; if Geddes were making logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deductions conditional upon it, without asserting that the axiom itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were true or false.  In modern-day mathematics, axioms are strictly empty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of empirical content.  That's what makes them axioms.  (All the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ironic, then, if our universe is a model satisfying an axiomatic system;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything that we call an &quot;empirical&quot; fact would simply be a consequence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relative to our location, of the axioms in which we happen to be embedded.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Those who believe the universe is math are driven to that conclusion by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the astonishing empirical suitability of math as a system for describing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe and the internal consistency of physics - it's clear that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a very basic thing, but to call it an axiom is inappropriate.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the right name for basic things we don't understand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Incidentally, Geddes's statements about MWI in QM are wrong.  MWI does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interact with the &quot;everything exists&quot; hypothesis, nor is MWI *in QM* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequence of the &quot;everything exists&quot; hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, Geddes, kindly do not call it &quot;Yudkowsky's arrow of morality&quot; for I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never said such a thing.
