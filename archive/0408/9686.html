<p><em>&gt; &gt; My sympathies are with you, but I don't think you can make a logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; connection between Transhumanism and Libertarianism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism is a view of a future with lots of technologically derived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; changes in it, up to and including fundamental changes in humans.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rooted in reasonable extrapolations of technical progress.  I was at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an observer as the aspects of the transhumanism view of our future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Libertarianism is a political philosophy about proper/ideal relation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans to each other.  Heinlein was the biggest political/philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; influence in my formative years so you have to rate me as at least as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lower case libertarian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As you know, the central tenet of libertarianism is the non-initiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of force as a succinct guide to proper human relationships.  While I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;admit it is free-floating it has much to recommend it.
</em><br>
<p>True, but it does not make the evolutionary psychology reality test.  It is 
<br>
also only one side of the behavior switch for war built into humans by 
<br>
evolution.  Such a meme could only arise during times of increasing wealth 
<br>
per capita.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, libertarianism, especially &quot;Libertarianism&quot; is rooted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; air--as are all political philosophies.  Infection with the Libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meme set too often results in uncompromising people with very poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political skills.  The only people worse off are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Objectivists/Randroids.  I think I know why if you are interested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is not part of rational discourse or even very civilized imho to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indulge in such verbal putdowns as &quot;randroids&quot;.   While I find many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;utter fools participating in objectivists circles including some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;highly placed ones, use of this term tend to deny importance to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entire idea space.   That is a mistake and an injustice.
</em><br>
<p>This is a matter of humor.  The entire libertarian spectrum has a lot of 
<br>
cult flavor, including the lack of humor that reaches an amazing extreme in 
<br>
scientology.  Heinlein and Rand were the memetic source of much of 
<br>
libertarianism.  So in the inevitable infighting they describe or deride 
<br>
each other as &quot;space cadets&quot; and Randroids.  Personally I think the motto 
<br>
of the Church of the SubGenious is appropriate.  (My connection to *them* 
<br>
goes back to the days of the Bavarian Fire Drills.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I remember years and years ago hearing an Objectivist rant that if offered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a choice, a person should choose to save their life over that of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of humanity.  It felt really wrong but it was a number of years before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I understood Hamilton's inclusive fitness and was able to say *why* it felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is certainly not a logical argument based on objectivist ideas per
</em><br>
<em>&gt;se.  Claiming such a universal should is itself not terribly logical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But it depends on the context.  The proper answer to an assumption of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be enslavers that one's life belongs to humanity (whatever that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;comes out to be in practice) is to hold one's life more valuable than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a collective parasitic view of humanity.
</em><br>
<p>This was about the correct *free choice* not enslaved.  It is the hyper 
<br>
rational choice.  But humans were not shaped by evolution to be hyper 
<br>
rational or even *rational* at times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The most accepted transhumanist meme set includes evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; psychology.  If someone wants a political philosophy to go along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism, they really should  think about basing it on EP at least up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the point we abandon human mental configuration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would be very interested in a sketch of what you (or others) believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this would look like.
</em><br>
<p>It would certainly include women having the power to limit family size, and 
<br>
a recognition that humans have psychological behavior switches that we want 
<br>
to keep out of certain modes.  I don't even know how many behavior switches 
<br>
humans have, but the one set off by anticipated privation (falling income 
<br>
per capita) that turns up the gain on xenophobic memes and leads to wars or 
<br>
related social disruptions is certainly one you *don't* want to switch 
<br>
on.  Understanding that war mode considerably reduces humans capacity for 
<br>
rational thinking would be an important factor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Memetics is really rooted in EP and transhumans tend to be up on memetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as well.  You might be amused that the &quot;meme about memes&quot; set off a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allergic reaction among Libertarians back in the 80s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't really see why it should
</em><br>
<p>It did--to my surprise, but thinking about it and the cultish nature of the 
<br>
whole libertarian spectrum it is obvious why in retrospect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;or how these are connected
</em><br>
<p>Because, although memes are not central, they are in the causal chain that 
<br>
leads to wars.  (Ultimately genes are central.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;or  why this is amusing
</em><br>
<p>Irony, denial of the cult like aspects of whatever people are intensely 
<br>
involved in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;or what your purpose is in relating it in this context.
</em><br>
<p>See Minsky on the function of humor.
