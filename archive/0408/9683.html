<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Given that the language of science used to describe the physical

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; world is mathematical, and given the Turing arguments (showing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; mapping between maths and algorithms), it follows that any of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; equations being used to describe a finite portion of physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; reality are back translatable into an algorithm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This does not follow automatically because physics is continuous,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Your statement is true, but it uses the wrong argument: computability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not depend on discreteness/continuity. It is true, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computability can only be defined for discrete sets, but there can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continous models whose all discrete manifestations are Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computable. There are mathematically definable discrete models that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not computable.
</em><br>
<p>My &quot;because&quot; should be understood in the sense of exhibiting a conceptual 
<br>
counterexample to the assertion that a mathematical language of physics is 
<br>
alone a sufficient condition to prove Turing computability.  For this it 
<br>
suffices to point out that a mathematical language can be interpreted as 
<br>
describing the interaction of fully arbitrary continuous functions; we 
<br>
would then have the abstract fact that some possible models of this 
<br>
language would not be exactly computable, albeit we could never think of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Albeit it was already a mathematical theorem that if our universe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ultimately consists of a finite or countable set of axioms (i.e., 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; equations), and the axioms are satisfiable by any model, they must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; satisfiable by a countable model.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You refer to the theorem of Lowenheim and Skolem which is in my personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion (as a mathematician) interesting stuff, but does not have any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical relevance. Its philosophical relavance can be disputed too. A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious problem is that people tend to talk about it without a proper 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the exact notion of *model* in mathematical logic.
</em><br>
<p>I'm still learning, but it looks to me like physics describes relations 
<br>
that hold between points in quantum configuration space.  Similarly, an 
<br>
axiom set, if we map it to a model, describes relations that hold between 
<br>
elements of the model.  This is what suggests to me that the TOE of physics 
<br>
might be analogous to an axiomatic system.  For me the fascinating thing is 
<br>
that although mathematicians can get along just fine using nothing but 
<br>
axioms, we appear to actually *exist* in the model, not the axioms.  I am 
<br>
still trying to wrap my mind around the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem as it 
<br>
applies to this - would there be any conceivable physical test that would 
<br>
tell us we were really in a uncountable model, or would the 
<br>
Lowenheim-Skolem theorem rule that out?
<br>
<p>If that was gibberish, do let me know.
<br>
<p>(I'm aware that mathematicians usually do not speak of sentient beings 
<br>
&quot;within the model&quot; or &quot;within the axioms&quot;, but complex enough axioms 
<br>
apparently generate a model including complex subprocesses that attempt to 
<br>
deduce the axioms by watching other model elements interact.)
