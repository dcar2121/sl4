<p>
Um.. O.K, you guys might be interested to know that
<br>
I've gotten some extremely harsh and disturbing
<br>
comments back from various (non-transhumanist) people
<br>
since posting that philosophical platform on my
<br>
web-site. 
<br>
<p>(Note:  I'm not referring to any of you guys.  You
<br>
guys were fine with it.  I'm talking about e-mails
<br>
from non-Transhumanists)
<br>
<p>People are calling me 'fascist' , a 'nutter', a
<br>
'scientologist religious fundamentalist' .  Other
<br>
comments from random strangers are that I'm 'insane',
<br>
the philosophy is 'bollocks' etc.  (These people seem
<br>
to have a pretty limited limited repertoire of insults
<br>
my the way).
<br>
<p>I realize that I'd didn't put any well-developed
<br>
arguments in my 'platform', but it was only intended
<br>
as an intro with links for people to follow up the
<br>
ideas.  I was simply trying to summarize my current
<br>
understanding of the fundamental principles of reality
<br>
as succiently and briefly as possible.
<br>
<p>I'm mystified as to why I should get such a reaction. 
<br>
Is there really anything in the piece I wrote which
<br>
even remotely suggests 'fascism'?  I really really
<br>
don't get it.  
<br>
<p>I have to wonder whether most people can actually
<br>
handle the truth.  Reality is reality.  I believe that
<br>
although the pool of knowledge is infinite, more
<br>
complex ideas are built from simpler ones.  At the
<br>
base of the infinite 'knowledge tree' it's a
<br>
reasonable supposition that there are a finite number
<br>
of general fundamental explanatory principles.  After
<br>
the fundamentals have been grapsed and sufficient
<br>
evidence presented, it would seem reasonable to
<br>
declare that we now have a 'theory of everything' in
<br>
the specific sense of understanding the fundamental
<br>
explanatory principles.
<br>
<p>But the question I now have to ask myself is whether
<br>
most people are capable of handling the truth. 
<br>
Reality is reality, but I've noticed that when one
<br>
points this out and keeps insisting on it, people just
<br>
seem to get angry.  Will human irrationality prevent a
<br>
successful Singularity from ever occuring?  Will the
<br>
'mob' one day storm the offices of Sing Inst?  I'm
<br>
sorry to say that I now think that that is a very
<br>
definite possibility :-(
<br>
<p>Eli and co need to be careful.  Very careful.  I've
<br>
tried to point this out repeatibly.  The 'truth' is a
<br>
very dangerous thing to actually state too much of. 
<br>
I'm increasingly beginning to realize that most humans
<br>
are NOT rational beings.  They run mainly on emotion. 
<br>
It's kinda been a depressing realization for me. 
<br>
<p>We can kinda get a totally false sense of progress and
<br>
optimism hanging out on the transhumanist lists.  The
<br>
transhumanist lists are generally filled with really
<br>
great open-minded people (like you guys on SL4!) who
<br>
are at least *vaguely* rational and respectful.  But
<br>
neither these lists nor the people who inhabit them
<br>
are at all representative of the wider net community. 
<br>
I often like to spend time on lists with people who
<br>
don't have a rational mind-set, just to cure myself of
<br>
unwarrented optimism from time to time.
<br>
<p>So what I would say to you guys at Sing Inst as advise
<br>
for the future:  Be careful.  Be tactful.  Be
<br>
'economical with the truth' if you have it.  Don't let
<br>
nativity about human nature ruin your chances of
<br>
pulling off a successful Singularity.
