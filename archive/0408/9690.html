<em>&gt; I am told there are natural-seeming statements about the natural

</em><br>
<p>I don't think it is an argument against &quot;infinite set atheism&quot;, whatever 
<br>
it is.
<br>
<p>I seem to have multiple personalities. My positivist personality does 
<br>
not believe in infinite
<br>
sets, but easily accepts such phenomenons.
<br>
<p>I think that the mathematical statements have different degrees of 
<br>
&quot;absoluteness&quot;
<br>
(some kind of relevance to the existing world).
<br>
<p>For example:
<br>
<p>&quot;1+1=2&quot; is an absolute statement which is indisputable. One reason for 
<br>
that, that it
<br>
does not include quantors.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is an odd perfect number&quot; has a high relevance, since it can be 
<br>
refuted by
<br>
giving an example. Its independence to any reasonable axiom-system would 
<br>
prove
<br>
its validity. This shows that this statement is somewhat absolute.
<br>
<p>&quot;There are infinitely many prime numbers&quot; is less absolute, but it is 
<br>
still quite absolute,
<br>
since you can show a concrete Turing machine generating them.
<br>
<p>&quot;Every Goodstein sequence stops&quot; is even less absolute since you can 
<br>
neither
<br>
refute it nor exhibit some sequence of objects supporting it.
<br>
<p>&quot;P!=NP&quot; is even less absolute, since one cannot decide for an algorithm 
<br>
whether
<br>
it is in P or not. So there are a lot of nasty possibilities. For 
<br>
example one could
<br>
imagine that there is not (provably) any NP-complete algorith algorithm 
<br>
which is
<br>
provably in P, but there is one which is in P (but not provably 
<br>
polynomial).
<br>
I would not even be surprised if his would be the case,
<br>
a &quot;strong AI&quot; would be a plausible candidate for such an algorithm.
<br>
<p>The axiom of choice is even less absolute. It cannot be refuted or 
<br>
supported by
<br>
any examples. I don't know of any interpretation which holds any information
<br>
about the &quot;real world&quot;.
