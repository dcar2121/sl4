<p>What you have said is 100% assumption. There is
<br>
currently no known way of reducing the &quot;information
<br>
content of the words&quot; into a nice piece of finite
<br>
mathematics. Nor is there any reason to believe there
<br>
will ever be a way to do this; see my previous
<br>
argument about an infinite set of possible minds
<br>
interacting with the word abstract or the fairytale
<br>
abstract.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Every conceivable description of anything you can
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm.
</em><br>
<p>You have a failure to acknowledge that Numerocentric
<br>
reductionism, in the extreme form as applied to ALL
<br>
things, might be wrong. We are not talking about just
<br>
this universe, &quot;All&quot; is more inclusive than that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This includes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all notions you may have about other universes where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply. 
</em><br>
<p>I agree that my notions of whatever it is i am
<br>
describing are inherently mathematical, because i am a
<br>
neural pattern. But you are thinking like a robot
<br>
without any understanding of the word &quot;mu&quot; or the
<br>
ability to see outside your own formal systems. Im not
<br>
talking about *my notions* of anything, im talking
<br>
about the actual abstractions of those notions, namely
<br>
the fairytale universes. To limit them to just being
<br>
*my notions* is to see just one perspective on them,
<br>
using a single formal system, its not seeing outside
<br>
the box. You are commiting the fallacy of a machine
<br>
that says &quot;cannot compute&quot;, &quot;cannot compute&quot;
<br>
repeatedly when faced with a seemingly impossible
<br>
object or &quot;koan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What you are really saying is &quot;let's pretend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math doesn't apply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this universe so that I can imagine another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe in which math 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't apply&quot;, which is what this distills down to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you haven't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figured it out yet.
</em><br>
<p>Math does apply. But so does language. If math was the
<br>
simplest explanation for anything then why wouldnt we
<br>
use it on a day to day basis to make rational
<br>
arguments? Its funny how over 99% of sl4 posts are
<br>
coposed entirely of words. It turns out that the
<br>
simplest way to explain most human situations is to
<br>
use natural language. Language is a code, just as math
<br>
is a code, and things can manifest from language too.
<br>
Generally speaking, humans compute in language not
<br>
math. Though we often try to reduce our rational
<br>
arguments to pure logic and math, quite often the task
<br>
is too complex for us to complete, and may even be
<br>
theoretically impossible. The idea that all the
<br>
manifestions of our conscious understandings are
<br>
theoretically reducible to math is an ASSUMPTION.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can no more imagine a world where mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't apply than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can imagine the number pi.
</em><br>
<p>Let me make my position clear, i am
<br>
numero-reductionist in the sense that i believe that
<br>
*this* universe is entirely reducible to math. But
<br>
that does not rule out the possibility that there are
<br>
other more holistic levels of explanation accesible to
<br>
complex beings like ourselves with complex neural
<br>
wirings capable of organising patterns into emergent
<br>
hierarchies, indeed language is one such example of a
<br>
holistic level of explanantion. There is no reason to
<br>
believe that our brain has to convert natural language
<br>
into numbers in order to process it, this would
<br>
probably be too inefficient to be feasible on a human
<br>
timescale anyway.
<br>
<p>I find it more acceptable to say that &quot;All is
<br>
information&quot; rather than &quot;All is number&quot; because
<br>
although i can conceive of abstract entities which are
<br>
not reducible to number, i cannot currently conceive
<br>
of anything which cannot in some way be thought of as
<br>
information. Though the fact that i can contemplate
<br>
this suggests to me that i shouldnt rule it out.
<br>
Certainly fairytales can be thought of as information,
<br>
on that we can both agree.
