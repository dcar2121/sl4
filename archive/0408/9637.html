David,
<br>
<p>If you are specifically interested in AGI you may want to post to
<br>
<a href="http://agiri.org/agilist">http://agiri.org/agilist</a>
<br>
<p>I'm sure there are others who want to discuss technical issues - actually
<br>
building an AI

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking for other people who want to discuss problems dealing with AI
<br>
and helping to make the singularity a reality.  I am also interested in ways
<br>
of implementing different aspects of intelligent functioning of an AI
<br>
program.  There seems to be different difficulty levels depending on whether
<br>
we are talking about the questions who, what, why, or how.  Problem solving
<br>
seems to be another area again.  I have read &quot;Creating Friendly AI&quot;, &quot;Seed
<br>
AI&quot; and many other documents from the SIAI web site.  I am interested in
<br>
other people's opinion on many on the topics covered there but in most cases
<br>
the arguments seem to have been left out and only the conclusions remain.  I
<br>
am very interested in the arguments of many of those AI topics.  I have
<br>
shimmed over many of the posting on the SL4 mailing list but it is hard to
<br>
get to the meat and potatoes because the list is a monolithic 9586 entry
<br>
list.  I sympathize with  Eliezer in that is must be hard to get mailings
<br>
into usable categories.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am 49 years old, worked in the micro computer field as a developer and
<br>
custom program designer and programmer for 27 1/2 years.  I have designed,
<br>
programmed and sold over 30,000 copies of a high level pseudo compiler in
<br>
the 1980's.  The program was written in about 34,000 lines of C and about
<br>
500 lines of assember.  I have professionally worked for about 100 different
<br>
clients and programmed in 10-20 languages.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have wanted to build robots and produce an AI for my whole career.  3
<br>
Years ago, I started working about 1/2 my time on some robot designs.  This
<br>
was to give my AI a reach into the real world.  1 year ago I decided that
<br>
without a new language, my programming for a robot would go nowhere.  Last
<br>
December I started writing my new language.  I am now almost at the stage
<br>
that I can start to build the AI program I have dreamed of for at least the
<br>
last 20 years.  I currently spend a little more than 1/2 of my time on this
<br>
project.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just talk.  I have multi programs running at the same time,
<br>
and swapping back and forth on every instruction with an overhead of only
<br>
6%.  I can import 100,000 customer names and addresses in less than .5
<br>
second and index by name in the same amount of time.  My interpreted
<br>
instruction rate is about 9 million instructions per second.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in like minded people and I am not sure whether my
<br>
comments (and myself) are welcome or not.  Some of what I have seen leads me
<br>
to believe that this might be a one man mailing list.  I hope it is not.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to know if others are interested in my participation on this
<br>
list.  If not I will not waste any more of your time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;David Clark
