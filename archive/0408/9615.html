</em><br>
<p>Do you see the elegance and complexity of a fractal
<br>
and still think of it as a human construct? Clearly
<br>
most of mathematics is not simple enough to be
<br>
&quot;invented&quot;. You could argue that the human
<br>
brain/mind/consciousness has such a part to play in
<br>
our ability to interpret and manipulate the symbols to
<br>
the extent that the real math is hidden from us, but
<br>
even so the mathematics is definitely &quot;out there&quot; and
<br>
not just figments of our minds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... do my programs &quot;manifest&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;universe&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>Well they manifest they're universes i.e. each
<br>
computer program is equivalent to a mini-universe. And
<br>
there is strong reason to believe that our universe,
<br>
in its entirety, is itself describable by a single
<br>
unique program, &quot;Wolfram's code&quot;, rather than just a
<br>
bunch of mathematical bits and pieces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He told me that there were currently no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known applications or physical use for Lattice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory in the world!  How does this correlate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality and pure mathematics?
</em><br>
<p>The mathematics of lattice theory is real, just as
<br>
physically applicable mathematics is real. The fact
<br>
that some mathematical discovery is not physically
<br>
applicable doesnt make it any less real, nor should we
<br>
expect any given piece of math to be physically
<br>
applicable since mathematics is by nature ABSTRACT.
<br>
The physical world is itself an abstraction, but only
<br>
an infinitesimally small subset of the complete set of
<br>
abstract entities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; should we believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things just because they seem &quot;obvious&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Hell yes! if something is obvious to me, then thats
<br>
better than a step-by-step rational argument IMO.
<br>
Unfortunately obviousness is not easy to translate to
<br>
other people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recall correctly &quot;all is math&quot; goes back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pythagoras, and I don't know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who first speculated that everything exists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Parmenides is the first in recorded literature i
<br>
believe.
<br>
<em>&gt; Who cares who first postulated some particular idea?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you say you believe XYZ then you should have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support your belief.  I am not impressed by the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that someone who was quoted lived long ago.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, because they didn't have the benefit of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the knowledge that has been gained since, their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions are probably worth less. 
</em><br>
<p>Philosophers like Pythagoras and Parmenides are no
<br>
less intelligent than the philosophers of today just
<br>
because they didnt have modern books or calculators.
<br>
Metaphysics is one of the few fields of human
<br>
understanding which hasnt changed much in the last few
<br>
thousand years, and one of the few fields where the
<br>
collection of new knowledge isnt going to improve our
<br>
understanding. Im hoping that will change during the
<br>
Singularity with a quantitive leap in sentient
<br>
intelligence on Earth, which we would expect would
<br>
yield a qualititive leap in our ability to understand
<br>
extremely complex issues and concepts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many times I think up new (to me)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas and I am subsequently told someone thought of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them before me.  I feel much smarter having walked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such great shoes!
</em><br>
<p>Good for you. I usually have a negative reaction when
<br>
i find out my ideas arent as original as i thought
<br>
they were. I find it damn annoying.
