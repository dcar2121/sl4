<p>
I've finished a 2nd draft of my
<br>
'Libertarian-Transhumanist Philosophical Platform'.
<br>
which is hopefully a substantial improvement on the
<br>
1st bare-bones effort.  This 2nd draft mentions
<br>
Eliezer and some of his ideas, so I'd better check it
<br>
out with him.  I'll post it to my web-site in a few
<br>
days time.
<br>
<p>I think I now finally understand all of the basic
<br>
fundamental principles underlying reality.  The news
<br>
is that I think I now totally understand what morality
<br>
really is.  It's all cleared up. Read my summary soon.
<br>
&nbsp;I'll post the summary of my conculusions here in a
<br>
few days, and I'm in the process of writing up a much
<br>
longer paper.
<br>
<p>I've learned much and now I'm starting to rapidly and
<br>
recursively self-improve ;)
<br>
<p>All of the powers of the Cosmos are gathering.  The
<br>
sands of destiny swirl faster around all the principle
<br>
players in this game.  More no mistake, this is the
<br>
time of the Quickening.  With all the Transhumanist
<br>
books and conferences and the major Institutes
<br>
starting to get their act together, events are
<br>
definitely accelerating quicker than I had
<br>
anticipated! 
<br>
<p>(Incidentally you may be interested in reading my
<br>
essay which will be published in Imm Inst's upcoming
<br>
book 'The Scientific Conquest of Death'.  I'm now
<br>
confident that the ideas I developed for the section I
<br>
wrote: 'An Introduction to Immortalist Morality' are
<br>
actually a correct portion of the full solution to the
<br>
Friendliness problem)
<br>
<p>I never really fully believed in the Singularity until
<br>
now.  Now I know it's actually going to happen.
<br>
<p>&quot;To seek values is to create values, and the values
<br>
created further the task of seeking...&quot;
