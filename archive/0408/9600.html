<p>
Separating a science from a pseudo-science is not always easy, even for
<br>
scientists. For example, in the current issue of SKEPTIC magazine there is
<br>
another anti-cryonics article (not the first one they've published) in which
<br>
a cryobiologist is quoted extensively. While he admits that he might be
<br>
wrong in dismissing cryonics, this does not stop him from 1) comparing it to
<br>
a religion, and 2) claiming (quite wrongly) that cryonics violates known
<br>
laws of physics and chemistry.
<br>
<p>People can argue that cryonics or the Singularity are stuff and nonsense,
<br>
but they would be well advised to do so on factual or logical grounds. Most
<br>
arguments promulgated against such ideas fail to engage their core
<br>
arguments, aiming instead at unflattering comparisons, scary
<br>
misrepresentations, and ad hominem targets.
<br>
<p>In the end, the only thing that will silence persistent critics is a
<br>
proof-of-concept demonstration. In the case of cryonics, where revival from
<br>
cryo-suspension is the goal, I think that's probably 75-100 years away. In
<br>
the case of an FAI or a Singularity by other means, the demonstration may
<br>
occur in less than half that time, but would take place so quickly that the
<br>
critics will be overwhelmed by events. In other words, there won't even be
<br>
time for an &quot;I told you so&quot; from our side.
<br>
