<p>Suppose I ask you to imagine and describe the events in a fairytale
<br>
universe.  You are a physical entity, physics is math, thus I can model the
<br>
events in the fairytale universe using math.  If you write a computer
<br>
program to model the fairytale universe in more detail, the computer is
<br>
composed of particles and the particles are math.  In principle, we could,
<br>
from within the fairytale universe, realize that the simplest explanation
<br>
behind our universe was math at a deeper level of recursion - that the gods
<br>
who created Elves and Men in the Dawn, and the mystical Laws of Sorcery,
<br>
must be the mythology of creatures who evolved in a strictly physical
<br>
universe governed by math.  It would take a heck of a lot of computing
<br>
power to realize that the simulation argument was the explanation of lowest
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity.  But in theory, in the math of rationality, it could
<br>
be done.  And indeed this would be the correct explanation, because this
<br>
fairytale universe we are discussing, is, exactly, the mythology of
<br>
creatures of math, us.
<br>
<p>I can't even imagine a universe with a simplest explanation that wasn't
<br>
math.  It might exist, but I can't imagine it.  I'm the one who has to 
<br>
compute the simplest explanation, and this I do using math.  If I saw a 
<br>
nonmathematically coherent universe, I wouldn't see the coherence; it would 
<br>
look to me like chaos.  If there were people inside, modeling the 
<br>
nonmathematical coherence of their universe using their internal 
<br>
nonmathematical coherences, I wouldn't see any of it.  To me it would just 
<br>
look like snow on a television screen.
