<p>
I am looking for other people who want to discuss problems dealing with AI and helping to make the singularity a reality.  I am also interested in ways of implementing different aspects of intelligent functioning of an AI program.  There seems to be different difficulty levels depending on whether we are talking about the questions who, what, why, or how.  Problem solving seems to be another area again.  I have read &quot;Creating Friendly AI&quot;, &quot;Seed AI&quot; and many other documents from the SIAI web site.  I am interested in other people's opinion on many on the topics covered there but in most cases the arguments seem to have been left out and only the conclusions remain.  I am very interested in the arguments of many of those AI topics.  I have shimmed over many of the posting on the SL4 mailing list but it is hard to get to the meat and potatoes because the list is a monolithic 9586 entry list.  I sympathize with  Eliezer in that is must be hard to get mailings into usable categories.
<br>
<p>I am 49 years old, worked in the micro computer field as a developer and custom program designer and programmer for 27 1/2 years.  I have designed, programmed and sold over 30,000 copies of a high level pseudo compiler in the 1980's.  The program was written in about 34,000 lines of C and about 500 lines of assember.  I have professionally worked for about 100 different clients and programmed in 10-20 languages.
<br>
<p>I have wanted to build robots and produce an AI for my whole career.  3 Years ago, I started working about 1/2 my time on some robot designs.  This was to give my AI a reach into the real world.  1 year ago I decided that without a new language, my programming for a robot would go nowhere.  Last December I started writing my new language.  I am now almost at the stage that I can start to build the AI program I have dreamed of for at least the last 20 years.  I currently spend a little more than 1/2 of my time on this project.
<br>
<p>This is not just talk.  I have multi programs running at the same time, and swapping back and forth on every instruction with an overhead of only 6%.  I can import 100,000 customer names and addresses in less than .5 second and index by name in the same amount of time.  My interpreted instruction rate is about 9 million instructions per second.
<br>
<p>I am interested in like minded people and I am not sure whether my comments (and myself) are welcome or not.  Some of what I have seen leads me to believe that this might be a one man mailing list.  I hope it is not.
<br>
<p>I would like to know if others are interested in my participation on this list.  If not I will not waste any more of your time.
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p>David Clark
