</em><br>
<em>&gt; Speaking of which, kindly stop putting words in my mouth as well:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Eugen Leitl believes that altruism is impossible, period, for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligence (SI), whether that superintelligence is derived from humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or AIs. The last time we argued this, which was quite sometime ago, and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his views may be different now, he was arguing for the impossibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruistic SI based on the belief that, one, &quot;All minds necessarily seek to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive as a subgoal, therefore this subgoal can stomp on a supergoal&quot;; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two, &quot;In a Darwinian scenario, any mind that doesn't seek to survive will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die, therefore all minds will evolve an independent drive for survival.&quot; His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first argument is flawed on grounds that it's easy to construct mind models
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which subgoals do not stomp supergoals; in fact, it's easy to construct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind models in which &quot;subgoals&quot; are only temporary empirical regularities, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even, given sufficient computing power, mind models in which no elements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;subgoals&quot; exist. His second argument is flawed on two grounds. First,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darwinian survival properties do not necessarily have a one-to-one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspondence with cognitive motives, and if they did, the universal drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be reproduction, not survival; and second, post-Singularity scenarios
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't contain any room for Darwinian scenarios, let alone Darwinian scenarios
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are capable of wiping out every trace of intelligent morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eugen essentially views evolutionary design as the strongest form of design,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much like John Smart, though possibly for different reasons, and thus he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discounts intelligence as a possible navigator in the distribution of future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds. (I do wish to note that I may be misrepresenting Eugen here.) Eugen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I have also discussed his ideas for a Singularity without AI. As I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recall, his ideas require the uploading of a substantial portion of the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race, possibly even without their consent, and distributing these uploads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout the Solar System, before any of them are allowed to begin a hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takeoff, except for a small steering committee, which is supposed to abstain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from any intelligence enhancement, because he doesn't trust uploads either. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe the practical feasibility, and likely the desirability, of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario is zero.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've never said the quotes you attribute to me in &quot;&quot;, and you *do* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misprepresent several things we've talked about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So kindly pull it from your site. Thanks. (Why did I need to find this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through Google of all things? Before you write stuff about people, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publish it, you ought to notify said people to prevent reactions like this). 
</em><br>
<p>Do you want to provide a rephrase of this, or point out particular things 
<br>
that are misrepresented?  Or would you prefer just pulling the entire segment?
<br>
<p>(Incidentally, this is from - if I recall correctly - an IRC interview in 
<br>
2002.  I provided the response in realtime, a la interview format, hence 
<br>
the non-notification.  Sorry anyway.)
