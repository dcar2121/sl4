<p>It is a valid point and I completely agree.
<br>
<p>Just a side remark: I never stated that the goodstein sequence or P!=NP
<br>
has no relevance to the physical reality as we know it. Far from that!
<br>
I just think that a lot of people including most mathematiciains do
<br>
not differenciate between different type of existences. If I write down an
<br>
logical expression starting with a quantor it does not always imply the
<br>
(possible) existence or nonexistence of objects in the &quot;real physical 
<br>
world&quot;.
<br>
There are a lot of degrees of existence including constructible finite 
<br>
structures,
<br>
potentially infinite but recursive objects, countable but not omputable
<br>
objects, unreachable cardinals and a lot of other complicated possibilities.
<br>
I don't say I believe or not belive in any of them, I just say that one
<br>
should differentiate between those type of &quot;existences&quot;.
<br>
<p>Another point: the Axiom of Choice is also a useful &quot;tool of logic&quot;. In 
<br>
algebra
<br>
it is common that statements can be proved for most practically relevant
<br>
cases, but the general case requires the Axiom of Choice. (The existence
<br>
of the algebraic closure of fields is a prominent but not singular example)
<br>
In this sense the Axiom of Choice also yields a more &quot;compressed 
<br>
explanation&quot;.
<br>
This does not make me believe in the existance of the cardinal numbers and
<br>
similar stuff. However my intuition is that a PROP using AOC would be more
<br>
efficient than another one not considering it at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wish I knew exactly *which* axioms of ZFC allow mathematicians to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that every Goodstein sequence stops!  Which specific aspect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ZFC makes ZFC a more compressed explanation for real-world physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors than PA?  I doubt the Axiom of Choice has anything to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it.  But I would be forced to believe in infinite sets if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were the simplest explanation for the behavior of the Goodstein 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence, and there was no simpler explanation that did not postulate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite sets. 
</em><br>
<p>In fact, you don't need the Axiom of Choice.  Operations on
<br>
countable cardinal numbers are needed. I could not tell whether
<br>
you need the full ZFC or not. My guess is that you need it.
