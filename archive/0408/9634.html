<p>This is interesting. Have you considered the
<br>
&quot;universe&quot; of a fairytale? Fairytale universes are
<br>
built from words not math; although the words may
<br>
describe certain topological relationships between
<br>
characters, objects etc the descriptions are notably
<br>
fuzzy and non-mathematical. The fact that we can
<br>
imagine a fairytale universe doesnt help because the
<br>
description is never good enough for our minds to
<br>
build perfect 3D models of what is going on, and
<br>
certainly not ones that we can all agree are accurate;
<br>
whatever models we build in our own minds while
<br>
reading the story are generally too fuzzy to be
<br>
measured consistently anyway.
<br>
<p>Fairytale universes satisfy the property of
<br>
conceivability and so they exist within my &quot;domain of
<br>
all abstract entities&quot; but i wouldnt assume that they
<br>
have any connection with pure math. Their various
<br>
interpretations may be mathematical in nature, but as
<br>
things-in-themselves they somehow steer clear of the
<br>
math.
<br>
<p>You might want to argue that words and descriptions
<br>
can in principle be reduced to math, with sufficient
<br>
understanding of the complexity of natural language.
<br>
Eg by the analysis of the neural patterns generated by
<br>
some generic artificial future mind when presented
<br>
with different textual stimuli. I have reason to be
<br>
sceptical that a direct translation from words to pure
<br>
numerical information will ever be possible. My
<br>
argument is that while the particular instantiations
<br>
of each word may be analysed in great depth, the words
<br>
themselves are abstractions until read or said etc and
<br>
their meaning and the qualia they produce is variable
<br>
in different instances and observer relative. Since
<br>
there are an infinite number of minds in the
<br>
metaverse, there are a infinite number of possible
<br>
qualia associated with any given
<br>
word/phrase/description. Im not saying it definitely
<br>
isnt possible; just that i am dubious that even our
<br>
post-Singularity minds will ever be able to accurately
<br>
convert a fairytale universe described in natural
<br>
language into pure numbers.
