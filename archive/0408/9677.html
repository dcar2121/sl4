<em>&gt; My sympathies are with you, but I don't think you can make a logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection between Transhumanism and Libertarianism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanism is a view of a future with lots of technologically derived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes in it, up to and including fundamental changes in humans.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rooted in reasonable extrapolations of technical progress.  I was at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an observer as the aspects of the transhumanism view of our future developed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarianism is a political philosophy about proper/ideal relation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans to each other.  Heinlein was the biggest political/philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence in my formative years so you have to rate me as at least as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower case libertarian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As you know, the central tenet of libertarianism is the non-initiation
<br>
of force as a succinct guide to proper human relationships.  While I
<br>
admit it is free-floating it has much to recommend it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, libertarianism, especially &quot;Libertarianism&quot; is rooted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air--as are all political philosophies.  Infection with the Libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme set too often results in uncompromising people with very poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political skills.  The only people worse off are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectivists/Randroids.  I think I know why if you are interested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It is not part of rational discourse or even very civilized imho to
<br>
indulge in such verbal putdowns as &quot;randroids&quot;.   While I find many
<br>
utter fools participating in objectivists circles including some
<br>
highly placed ones, use of this term tend to deny importance to the
<br>
entire idea space.   That is a mistake and an injustice.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I remember years and years ago hearing an Objectivist rant that if offered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a choice, a person should choose to save their life over that of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of humanity.  It felt really wrong but it was a number of years before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understood Hamilton's inclusive fitness and was able to say *why* it felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is certainly not a logical argument based on objectivist ideas per
<br>
se.  Claiming such a universal should is itself not terribly logical. 
<br>
But it depends on the context.  The proper answer to an assumption of
<br>
would be enslavers that one's life belongs to humanity (whatever that
<br>
comes out to be in practice) is to hold one's life more valuable than
<br>
such a collective parasitic view of humanity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The most accepted transhumanist meme set includes evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology.  If someone wants a political philosophy to go along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, they really should  think about basing it on EP at least up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point we abandon human mental configuration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I would be very interested in a sketch of what you (or others) believe
<br>
this would look like.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Memetics is really rooted in EP and transhumans tend to be up on memetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well.  You might be amused that the &quot;meme about memes&quot; set off a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allergic reaction among Libertarians back in the 80s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I don't really see why it should or how these are connected or  why
<br>
this is amusing or what your purpose is in relating it in this
<br>
context.
