</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But what makes you think the new axioms are correct?  If you add an axiom
<br>
to PA stating that PA is consistent - call this new system PA+1 - what
<br>
makes you think that PA really *is* consistent?  This is what people
<br>
misunderstand about Godel's Theorem; they think we know a truth that PA
<br>
doesn't.  Actually, we just guess it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, if reality is a system of infinite axioms (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be finitely specified), then ALL mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truths would in fact be decidable.  Every mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth would be embedded in a broader axiomatic system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the one needed to state it as a proposition.
</em><br>
<p>Given that PA is consistent, I think that PA+1 has the same model as PA...
<br>
actually, I don't know this, but it seems &quot;intuitively likely&quot; and we all
<br>
know how reliable that is.
<br>
<p>The behaviors of physics are not analogous to sentences in predicate
<br>
calculus since no real-world physical behavior contains a universal or
<br>
existential quantifier.  Physics doesn't need an infinitely ascending
<br>
series of axioms to specify all finite physical behaviors.  The 
<br>
unspecifiable axiom set would only be needed to compress our description of 
<br>
some infinite sets of finite physical behaviors into a universally 
<br>
quantified sentence asserted by the axiomatic system.
<br>
<p>Let G(x) mean &quot;x encodes a proof of the Godel sentence in PA&quot;.  The physics 
<br>
of the Peano system suffice to specify the finite behaviors ~G(1), ~G(2), 
<br>
~G(3).  If PA is consistent, the physics suffice to show ~G(x) for any 
<br>
given number x.  But manipulating the axiom system will not enable you to 
<br>
deduce, by logical manipulation of the axioms, that Ax:~G(x) - you have to 
<br>
check each x piecemeal, independently.  Logical deduction on the axioms 
<br>
will enable you to conclude that Ax:~G(x) iff Ax:~C(x) where C(x) means 
<br>
that x encodes a proof of a contradiction in PA.  But logical deduction 
<br>
will not let you deduce Ax:~G(x).  Nor is this something that I, or any 
<br>
human mathematician, knows; we only guess it because PA has worked pretty 
<br>
well so far.
<br>
<p>The problem with Peano arithmetic is not that PA doesn't completely 
<br>
describe all finite numeric behaviors, but that PA describes numeric 
<br>
behaviors with less compressibility than we would prefer - we can't 
<br>
universally quantify some predicates that are universally true (if PA is 
<br>
consistent).
