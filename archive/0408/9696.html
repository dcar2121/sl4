<p>There are already lots of well-researched tomes out there

<p>The Saudis would have had to have a very dysfunctional political

but even so, I don't think I would characterize their society as one

of increasing wealth, but decreasing.

<p>I don't know to what extent the Easter Islanders would have been
<br>
helped by a market system, since I know little about that situation.
