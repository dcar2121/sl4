<em>&gt; I've substantially edited and expanded the

<em>&gt; 'Metaphysics' section.  There are also several new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other additions to the doc.  Samantha and David,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please try reading this draft and see if it makes more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense this time.  Should be good enough to serve as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable intro now.  All comments welcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Links have been added this time.  The doc is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended as an introduction (to fully explain this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff would require a 1000 page book).  Readers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to follow up the links to obtain evidence for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each supposition.  Another point to consider is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every part of the reasoning process draws support from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every other part.  Consistency, coherence etc.  it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an integrated whole, not an axiomatic system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am quite sure you understand that consistency and coherence are not
<br>
sufficient to make such a system actually true.   Any logical system
<br>
is only as strong as its foundation.  This is why I harped on putting
<br>
something as questionalbe as &quot;reality is a manifesation of
<br>
mathematics&quot; at the foundation.   If the foundation is shaky then it
<br>
does not matter how strong the interconnections and building on top of
<br>
it are.  It will still fall down.   You don't actually require this to
<br>
build your structure.  What you require is what suggests this notion
<br>
to you and others.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; What is here is just a very brief introduction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summary of what I now think I know.  However read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the lines and you'll see some big patterns in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the structure of the reasoning.  As I said it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrated whole ;)  
</em><br>
<p>Heck, so are most systems of mysticism and various crank theories.  So what?:
<br>
<p>BTW, the Universal Turing machine does not in the least &quot;suggest that
<br>
all of reality is entirely computational&quot; in the sense you are
<br>
reaching for.
<br>
<p>More later if I feel inclined to wade into this.
