<p>Actually I was only referring to the truth of falsity of a statement in a
<br>
formal sense, and the viewpoint I was describing (which is not so common) is
<br>
called Intuitionism (e.g., see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionism</a>).
<br>
However, I suppose the position could be defined analogously in a more
<br>
informal setting as well--we could say that a statement is true if we could
<br>
(at least in theory) construct some experiment which would confirm its truth
<br>
or the truth of its negation. Now consider the existence of parallel
<br>
universes--if there is no experiment which can prove or disprove their
<br>
existence, then these generalized-intuitionists would say that the statement
<br>
&quot;parallel universes exist&quot; is neither a true nor false statement--it's
<br>
nonsense. The Platonist would say that either parallel universes exist or
<br>
they do not, although we may never be able to determine which is the case.
<br>
Despite Intuitionism's name, I find Platonism the more intuitive of the two.
<br>
<p>This topic seems to comes down to: did humans invent Mathematics or discover
<br>
it?
