</em><br>
<p>Well, I disagree.  I think that at root the
<br>
fundamental 'explanatory' principles of reality form a
<br>
unified whole which encompasses metaphysics,
<br>
epistemology, ethics and politics.  Popper's
<br>
epistemology, when sufficiently extended into
<br>
Pan-Critical Rationalism is a good approximation to
<br>
the Bayesian ideal capable of dealing with ALL aspects
<br>
of reality.  I think reason truly is all encompassing.
<br>
&nbsp;Reason can even *partially* (but not entirely) tell
<br>
us what to value.  I think many modern philosophers
<br>
and scientists realize this, but they're too scared to
<br>
say it.  They're 'keeping their heads down' and
<br>
staying out of ethics and politics for pragmatic
<br>
reasons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transhumanism is a view of a future with lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologically derived 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes in it, up to and including fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes in humans.  It is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rooted in reasonable extrapolations of technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress.  I was at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an observer as the aspects of the transhumanism view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our future developed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Libertarianism is a political philosophy about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper/ideal relation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans to each other.  Heinlein was the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political/philosophical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence in my formative years so you have to rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me as at least as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower case libertarian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately, libertarianism, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Libertarianism&quot; is rooted in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air--as are all political philosophies.  Infection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the Libertarianism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meme set too often results in uncompromising people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with very poor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political skills.  The only people worse off are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectivists/Randroids.  I think I know why if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are interested.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there are 'degrees' of Libertarianism.  Of
<br>
course any political philosophy has its crack-pots and
<br>
extremist elements.  It's more accurate to say that
<br>
I'm a 'Semi-Libertarian'.  I don't think individual
<br>
rights are an absolute.  I subscribe to the
<br>
Utilitarian approach of people like Richard Epstein. 
<br>
And that's the sensible position that most moderates
<br>
seem to come around to.
<br>
<p>Take out the anarchist extremists and crack-pots and
<br>
moderate the movement somewhat and there's a good
<br>
viable politics there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember years and years ago hearing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Objectivist rant that if offered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a choice, a person should choose to save their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life over that of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of humanity.  It felt really wrong but it was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of years before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understood Hamilton's inclusive fitness and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to say *why* it felt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Be careful not to equate Libertarianism with
<br>
Objectivism.  Thankfully, most Libertarians are not
<br>
Objectivists.
<br>
<p>I spent quite a few months visiting an NZ Objectivist
<br>
web-site, trying to persuade Objectivists there to
<br>
look into Transhumanism, Bayesian reasoning and
<br>
altruism but it was hopeless.  They just spat bile at
<br>
me.  I've now totally given up on those guys.  They're
<br>
rather like religious fundamentalists actually.  I'm
<br>
gonna steer well clear of those idiots from now on.
<br>
<p>I did used to toy with egoism as a viable ethical
<br>
theory but I've rejected it now.  I think pure egoism
<br>
is just as flawed as pure altruism.  I finally settled
<br>
on good old Utilitarianism with a mixture of altruism
<br>
and egoism.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most accepted transhumanist meme set includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology.  If someone wants a political philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to go along with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism, they really should  think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basing it on EP at least up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point we abandon human mental configuration.
</em><br>
<p>Yup, I agree with you there.  That's why in my
<br>
'platform' I said:
<br>
<p>&quot;So Good and Evil are not objective properties of
<br>
reality in the same way that mathematical or physical
<br>
facts are, since they are in part created by the
<br>
choices that humans make.  But the choices that people
<br>
make will be heavily influenced by human nature
<br>
itself.  Minds require brains shaped by our biological
<br>
heritage.  Evolutionary psychology studies how human
<br>
morals stem from the forces of biological evolution.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But morality is not wholly relative.  As explained,
<br>
the nature of a mind will be heavily influenced by its
<br>
physical substrate.  In humans that is our biological
<br>
evolutionary heritage.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;There should exist general characteristics that
<br>
virtually all rational beings (like humans) have in
<br>
common, emerging from their basic natures.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Memetics is really rooted in EP and transhumans tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be up on memetics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well.  You might be amused that the &quot;meme about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes&quot; set off a major 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allergic reaction among Libertarians back in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 80s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want the story, it is in a dozen postings on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the memetics list.  If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is interest I could condense it and post it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here as a bit of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical trivia.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't heard the story.  Post a little about it
<br>
here if you want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  From your next post down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;The one thing that's likely to trip up Sing Inst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;their over emphasis on 'altruism'.  Most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;who run around being 'altruistic' get a knife in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;back for their troubles.  Altruism is gonna be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eli's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;down-fall if he's not careful.  Because the Sing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Int
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;guys are so benign I think they tend to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;mistake of thinking that other people are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;than they actually are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope Eliezer has enough insight into both his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations and those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other people to keep him and the Institute out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble.  If you have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not read _Evolution of Cooperation_ by Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Axelrod, you should.
