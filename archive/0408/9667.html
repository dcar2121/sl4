</em><br>

</em><br>
(snip)
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm mystified as to why I should get such a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there really anything in the piece I wrote

</em><br>

</em><br>
Not from what I know of your writing. Your ideas
<br>
closely track mine. 'Fascist' just happens to be
<br>
one of the heavier semantic sticks you can beat
<br>
someone with even if their views/actions have no
<br>
relation to Mussolini's 'corporate state' or any
<br>
of its ideological descendants. On the other
<br>
hand, one is often not believed when one uses
<br>
this word seriously (when I use this word
<br>
referring to the people presently running the
<br>
United States, I have to make a special point of
<br>
saying that I have read up on fascism in
<br>
encyclopedia articles and books and that I am
<br>
referring to real historical and ideological
<br>
influences and parallels).
<br>
<em>&gt; I have to wonder whether most people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle the truth.
</em><br>
No, most cannot. Brainwashing is REAL, and
<br>
widespread. Most do not realize this.
<br>
<em>&gt;Will human irrationality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful Singularity from ever occuring? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'mob' one day storm the offices of Sing Inst? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorry to say that I now think that that is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definite possibility :-(
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eli and co need to be careful.  Very careful. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tried to point this out repeatibly.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'truth' is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very dangerous thing to actually state too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm increasingly beginning to realize that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are NOT rational beings.  They run mainly on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's kinda been a depressing realization for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me. 
</em><br>
Me too. I have read in a new Kurt Vonnegut essay,
<br>
&quot;Albert Einstein and Mark Twain gave up on the
<br>
human race at the end of their lives, even though
<br>
Twain hadn’t even seen World War I.&quot;

<br>
<em>&gt; So what I would say to you guys at Sing Inst as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the future:  Be careful.  Be tactful.  Be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'economical with the truth' if you have it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nativity about human nature ruin your chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pulling off a successful Singularity.  
</em><br>
You must mean 'naivete'. I don't use
<br>
spell-checkers much because they're context-dumb.
<br>
I have had the same thought.
<br>
Where we stand now, as I see it:
<br>
A
<br>
fascist/oligarchist/klepto-theo-cratic/choose-yer-own-word
<br>
clique has taken over the United States and other
<br>
nations. Soon it will have surveillance
<br>
capability, etc. to crush any resistance. 1984
<br>
forever, or until we're extinct (50% chance by
<br>
2100 AD according to Sir Martin Rees). Chances
<br>
are good that only a SAI can head off this
<br>
dictatorship, and save our asses, if that's what
<br>
it wants. The mob will arrive 5 min. after the
<br>
fascists (or other demagogues) figure this out.
<br>
I've written about a tenth of a novel about a
<br>
sandboxed FAI taking on the repressive State for
<br>
all the marbles. Wonder if I should delete it?
<br>
What you think?
