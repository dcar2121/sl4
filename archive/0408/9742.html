</em><br>
<p>That's certainly a point to consider.  But in an environment with no birth 
<br>
control, and a fixed technology base where chipped rocks are high tech, I 
<br>
don't see what form mutual cooperation might take.  Any thoughts?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I do not find convincing, as words on paper, the argument that the losing

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Darn near anything that does not kill everybody concerned is better than 
<br>
universal starvation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I want to see a mathematical model describing the necessary conditions for

</em><br>
<p>Serious fluctuations in the carrying capacity of the ecosystem happening 
<br>
once ever few years to once every few generations would be enough and 
<br>
certainly within the range we have seen in the tree ring and other records.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no obvious genetic reason for a tribe to adopt male children,
</em><br>
<p>Generally they were not, though there were exceptions where an awful lot of 
<br>
the tribe's males had been killed off.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and as I recall my childhood Torah studies, &quot;God&quot; told the Israelites to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kill off all conquered tribesfolk except virgin girls. That's not many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surviving genes.
</em><br>
<p>Better than none.
<br>
<p>Taking a typical episode, consider a fluctuation where two equal sized 
<br>
tribes occupy an area where there is a food reduction where only 75% of 
<br>
them would live through it.
<br>
<p>Assume that tribal behavior is the outcome of genes A and S for attack vs 
<br>
starve, and the tribe takes the course of the majority.  Further, let's 
<br>
assume that before this episode, the genes are close to a 50/50 
<br>
distribution.  (S type tribe 45/55 split, A type 55/45 split, first 
<br>
attacker type 60/40 A/S ratio.)  It is also reasonable to assume that being 
<br>
attacked is enough to get even a tribe with a slight majority of S genes to 
<br>
retaliate.
<br>
<p>There are three conditions, both S, both A, and one S the other A.  There 
<br>
is the well known factor that surprise attacks are more effective, the 
<br>
tribe with the higher A percentage attacks first and gets some advantage, 
<br>
but the outcome is not highly biased, say 60/40 for win/lose if you attack 
<br>
first.  Assume the young women carry the A and S genes in the same ratio as 
<br>
the males and that the next generation of the mixed tribe carries S and A 
<br>
genes in the same proportions.
<br>
<p>Both S, both tribes take a 25% hit in numbers, equal male and female 
<br>
deaths.   The tribes will be slower to rebound when the ecosystem becomes 
<br>
more productive.
<br>
<p>Both A, the tribe with the higher numbers of A  attacks first and has a 60 
<br>
percent chance of winning.  For simplicity the winning tribe kills the 
<br>
losing males without loss.  Since the food and population ratio has been 
<br>
restored, all the females and enough males get through the hard times.  The 
<br>
numbers work that the next generation has about the same A to S ratio.
<br>
<p>.6 x (.60 (1) +  .55(.5) /1.5  = .35
<br>
<p>plus
<br>
<p>.4 x (.60 (.5) + .55(1)/1.5 = .27
<br>
<p>So given these numbers the A genes have crept up to .62, not much but in 
<br>
the right direction.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One S and one A.
<br>
<p>in the case the S tribe wins (40%),
<br>
<p>.45(1) + .55(.5)/1.5 = .4833  (.1933)
<br>
<p>if they lose (60%)
<br>
<p>.45(.5) + .55(1)/1.5  = .5166  (.31)
<br>
<p>So on average the resultant would still be a tribe slightly over attack 
<br>
threshold.
<br>
<p>So as long as there are collections of tribes with A genes slightly in the 
<br>
lead, the next generation will be more prone to war.
<br>
<p>The factor that might make this go quicker is the sized of the next 
<br>
generation.  Tribes that had collectively killed half the males to get 
<br>
through the hard times would bounce back faster with twice as many women.
<br>
<p>Now that I have been thinking about this, it is known that other hominids, 
<br>
up to and including Neanderthals died out in contact with our kind of 
<br>
human.  Wars of this kind are, I make the case, based on anticipation of 
<br>
bleak prospects.  It could be that the ability to anticipate future 
<br>
hardships (because the game had mostly been killed or the berry crop 
<br>
failed) was unique to our line and induced us to kill not only fellow 
<br>
members of our species when hard times were a-coming, but other species in 
<br>
the same ecological niche.
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
<br>
<p>PS.  The check to prevent this from running away is that being too prone to 
<br>
fighting when not justified by a worse alternative is not conducive to 
<br>
getting your genes into the next generation.
