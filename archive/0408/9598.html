I'm not nervous about being mistaken for a cult by anyone who can tell the 
<br>
difference without a checklist.
<br>
<p>Statistical notes:  A characteristic such as (1) &quot;thinks he's a genius&quot; 
<br>
that correlates with both crackpots and geniuses is not useful for 
<br>
distinguishing between crackpots and geniuses unless you can demonstrate a 
<br>
differential conditional probability that would make the signifier Bayesian 
<br>
evidence.  Elementary statistical fallacy, but a very common and tenacious one.
<br>
<p>(And yes, many geniuses know damn well they're geniuses.  They're not 
<br>
stupid, though those who are not strong in the Way may be dishonest to 
<br>
themselves or to others.)
<br>
<p>In all seriousness, I don't think this sort of checklist is valuable. 
<br>
Gardner should have known better, devising a weapon that someone might as 
<br>
easily turn *as an accusation* against any number of non-crackpot theories. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Gardner presumably had some way to distinguish who was and wasn't 
<br>
a crackpot *before* he came up with this handy checklist, and that's what 
<br>
he needed to teach his readers.  The checklist exalts the signifier over 
<br>
the substance, and arguing over checklist items is the sort of thing that 
<br>
pops up all the time in, ahem, unmoderated usenet groups.
<br>
<p>And as a practical public relations issue, if you focus on this sort of 
<br>
thing, it just makes people think that there's something to argue over. 
<br>
Focus on genuinely being a noncrackpot, not on not looking like a crackpot, 
<br>
and anyone who can tell the difference without a checklist will understand.
