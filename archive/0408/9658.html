</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposition is correct has no merit whatsoever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without valid reasons to back it up.
</em><br>
<p>Yup I got your comments, thanks for those.  Didn't you
<br>
read what I said:  Most of the final theory is not
<br>
mine.  I just pulled a lot of different bits and
<br>
pieces of other people's work together and tied it all
<br>
together with a few extra ideas of my own.
<br>
<p>The Intro to the theory now has lots of links
<br>
referencing the evidence for each claim, and if you
<br>
click on all the links and read the work of all the
<br>
thinkers referenced, the evidence is all there.  It's
<br>
only a few extra 'big ideas' of my own that need
<br>
explanation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My main problems with your &quot;Philosophical Platform&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is your professing people should be free to think,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act etc on the one hand, and advocate that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute truth on the other.  Absolute truth in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics and morality and &quot;rational people will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the same (your) conclusions eventually&quot; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow you to decide who is a rational thinker and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who is not.  Who appointed you, Eliezer S. Yudkowsky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or anyone else to be the judge of what is right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, the truth or not.  There is no truth but only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sets of arguments that have varying degrees of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight depending on a person's basic philosophies. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; State your arguments are then lets see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions stand or fall.  Conclusions without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments remind me of religion which forces people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to turn off their brains and &quot;believe&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>See what I said above.  Most of the final theory is
<br>
not mine.  The referenced thinkers have already
<br>
published the evidence for nearly every step of the
<br>
argument.  You just need to clik through on to the
<br>
links and research it.
<br>
<p>As to truth, reality is what it is.  The fundamental
<br>
principles of reality are what they are, just like the
<br>
statement 2+2=4 is what it is.  I am not some
<br>
'appointed judge' and I'm sure Eliezer doesn't think
<br>
of himself that way either.  The truth simply is what
<br>
it is.
<br>
<p>Besides which I am not now proposing objective truth
<br>
for morality (I did until quite recently, but I now
<br>
realize that Eli was correct - there is no objective
<br>
morality).  What I actually suggested was some general
<br>
'universal' morals stemming from our nature as
<br>
rational beings.  Universal morals, not objective
<br>
morals.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without arguments, there is no basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation on any topic and I won't waste any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your or my time.
</em><br>
<p>See above.  Most of the arguments have already been
<br>
made by various thinkers.  You just need to click on
<br>
the links in my doc to read up on their work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You make the contention that  &quot;The three fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realms of existence are the mathematical, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical and the mental.&quot;.  In mathematics one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first concepts taught in about grade 5 is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between a number and a numeral.  A number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a count of something (real or otherwise) and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numeral is a label that is assigned to that number. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The assignment of the numeral is arbitrary but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normally agreed to for the purposes of conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with other humans.  A number in mathematics exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for all humans regardless of their own language but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the numeral for the number 1 can be 1, I, one, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any other numeral.  Mathematics is a numeral.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics affects or changes anything that exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the real world.  Mathematics was invented by many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human beings over a great many years and even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments and information in it's creation came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a study of the real world, it is still just a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numeral.  A label.  A simulation in some cases.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical universe might inspire parts of mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I have first hand knowledge of parts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mathematics (Lattice Theory) that have absolutely no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection with the real world.  How can you say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the physical world and mathematics are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent, faced with the previous undeniable fact?
</em><br>
<p>Aren't you contradicting yourself when you say that
<br>
there is a difference between a 'number' and a
<br>
'numeral' yet mathematics is just invention?  If maths
<br>
is just invention, what is difference between a number
<br>
and a numeral?  You say that maths is a numeral, I say
<br>
it's number ;)
<br>
<p>As to Lattice Theory, what you meant to say was that
<br>
you are not aware of any KNOWN connection with the
<br>
real world.  Of course I would claim that there is a
<br>
connection, you just haven't found out what it is yet.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How can the mind which is obviously not physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the brain is but it only manifests the mind.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the mind itself.) be the same as all physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.  Even to talk about reality and mix the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of abstract reality (something that is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real in our mind) and physical reality in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentence seems to require a huge amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justification and rational argument.  To consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the physical universe (stars, galaxies, earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and plain old dirt) to be equivalent to human minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to place an impossible importance on the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race, that I see absolutely no evidence of.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't imply that of the physical universe was
<br>
equivalent to 'human' minds at all!  I implied that
<br>
all of the physical universe has some general
<br>
'mind-like' properties.
<br>
<p>You may like to read the section I wrote in the
<br>
Epistemology section: 'The Fallacy of Logical
<br>
Positivism'.  The distinction abstract/concrete is
<br>
just an artifical human classification system.  We
<br>
can't presuppose in advance what is 'abstract' and
<br>
what is not.  The nature of reality is what we are
<br>
trying to find out. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Show me where my arguments are incorrect!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is easy to state conclusions backed by no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments and it is not ok just to quote someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else, famous or otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>It is perfectly O.K to quote someone else.  Scientists
<br>
do that all the time.  The links in the doc are there
<br>
you to follow up the arguments already made the
<br>
referenced thinkers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conclusions backed by no arguments are the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no conclusions at all.  (So much for rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish you all the best in your quest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You'll have to wait for my book to come out, in which
<br>
I'll try to lay down some detailed arguments for you. 
<br>
But that book is going to be 1000 pages and take 2
<br>
years for me to research and write.
<br>
