Hi Randall, thanks for keeping this sub-thread going.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I actually agree with you that it isn't clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our universe *is* math,
</em><br>
<p>Actually that is not my view. To me it *is* clear that
<br>
this universe is math because this universe is a
<br>
well-defined unique space, all such spaces occupy
<br>
their place in the mathematical subsector of the
<br>
platonosphere. Even if there was no compressiblity or
<br>
no TOE to unify the regularities, in essence it would
<br>
still be just a bunch of numbers.
<br>
<p>However human intellect is sufficiently complex as to
<br>
have the capability of understanding and abstractly
<br>
manipulating things which are not even part of this
<br>
universe and therefore not necessarily reducible to
<br>
math. Examples of this are: parallel universes,
<br>
qualia, software programs, memetics, possible
<br>
sociopolitical orders, kilometers, set theory,
<br>
infinity, fairytales, etc -the list is pretty much
<br>
endless. Some of these are obviously math-based, some
<br>
not so; but none of them are actually part of the
<br>
physical hardware of this universe. Humans are not
<br>
number crunchers; we dont understand all these
<br>
abstractions via reduction to numerals and equations,
<br>
we understand them via neighbouring concepts,
<br>
associations, metaphors and analogues. 
<br>
<p>Personally I believe that this kind of higher level
<br>
reasoning doesnt correlate at all well to the
<br>
mathematical underpinnings of our chemical/physical
<br>
wetware and it might well be proven that some &quot;neural
<br>
knots&quot; might be just implicitly too complex to
<br>
untangle. In those cases language might have a better
<br>
shot at actually translating what cannot be expressed
<br>
in pure math. I can already think of several examples
<br>
of concepts which havent got a hope in hell of being
<br>
written down in mathematical notation, yet can be
<br>
expressed with a single word...
<br>
<p>If someonone wants to tell me to shutup for 2 months,
<br>
i wont be offended. :-)
