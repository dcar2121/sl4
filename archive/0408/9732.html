&lt;meta&gt;
<br>
I've been flying around the country and therefore mostly
<br>
offline for the last few weeks.  I'll be leaving again in a
<br>
few days, so if I'm slow to respond to things, that is why.
<br>
&lt;/meta&gt;
<br>
<p><p>As has probably been fairly apparent, I discarded the
<br>
notion of infinities having any practical real existence
<br>
years ago for a variety of reasons.  Therefore, I suppose
<br>
I could be called an &quot;infinite set atheist&quot; even though I
<br>
wouldn't generally describe it that way.  Infinities are
<br>
arguably interesting and useful in mathematics, but do not
<br>
have a practical application in real systems other than as
<br>
crude approximations. Since I concern myself solely with 
<br>
systems that exist in our universe, I do not have much use
<br>
for the notion.  This needs to be explained though, because
<br>
the above is different than asserting that the universe is
<br>
finite state.
<br>
<p>The kinds of systems I assume have two basic properties:
<br>
<p>1.) They are countable in all dimensions (i.e. discrete).
<br>
For our universe, the Planck dimensions work just fine as a
<br>
physical analogue of this.
<br>
<p>2.) In finite time, the system can only express finite
<br>
algorithms. The speed of light serves this function given
<br>
#1.  (For all I know, this may follow from #1; I have not
<br>
thought about it very hard.)
<br>
<p><p>The implied asterisk above is that countable doesn't mandate
<br>
finite-ness, and having a system bound to finite-state-ness
<br>
in finite time is a perfectly adequate description of real
<br>
systems.  No point in overly restricting the model when not
<br>
necessary, and it doesn't affect the mathematical treatment
<br>
of a system.  So in a sense, I don't have a problem with
<br>
infinities as long as they are never expressible as a
<br>
practical matter.  In other words, they can be treated as
<br>
finite state systems for many purposes even if they
<br>
technically are not under the usual mathematical
<br>
definitions.  You can only have infinite algorithms given
<br>
infinite time (and assuming infinite space).
<br>
<p>A fun theoretical part is that the limit of K-complexity for
<br>
a given computer varies as a function of time, among other
<br>
things, a more accurate model generally even for normal
<br>
silicon, though it is approximated to a static value.  I
<br>
cannot recall ever seeing this treated as variable in
<br>
theory in this way.  Pervasively treating a variable as static in theory
<br>
is not unusual, e.g. a similar type of situation exists in
<br>
Black-Scholes, as long as one is aware of this approximation so that it
<br>
can be discarded when necessary.
<br>
<p>This is closely related to the memory latency problem of
<br>
hardware.  No matter how much RAM you theoretically have,
<br>
the size of an algorithm is constrained by the amount of
<br>
space you can reference in a finite period time.
<br>
<p>Not too much meat here -- I'm on a time restriction -- but
<br>
there you have it. I've taken to calling systems that 
<br>
meet this description as &quot;algorithmically finite&quot;, as
<br>
I consider them a useful and distinct class of system, but
<br>
as far as I've been able to tell there is no term in
<br>
mathematics for this particular type of tidy theoretical
<br>
system.
