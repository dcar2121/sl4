<p>snip
<br>
<p>My sympathies are with you, but I don't think you can make a logical 
<br>
connection between Transhumanism and Libertarianism.
<br>
<p>Transhumanism is a view of a future with lots of technologically derived 
<br>
changes in it, up to and including fundamental changes in humans.  It is 
<br>
rooted in reasonable extrapolations of technical progress.  I was at least 
<br>
an observer as the aspects of the transhumanism view of our future developed.
<br>
<p>Libertarianism is a political philosophy about proper/ideal relation of 
<br>
humans to each other.  Heinlein was the biggest political/philosophical 
<br>
influence in my formative years so you have to rate me as at least as a 
<br>
lower case libertarian.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, libertarianism, especially &quot;Libertarianism&quot; is rooted in 
<br>
air--as are all political philosophies.  Infection with the Libertarianism 
<br>
meme set too often results in uncompromising people with very poor 
<br>
political skills.  The only people worse off are the 
<br>
Objectivists/Randroids.  I think I know why if you are interested.
<br>
<p>I remember years and years ago hearing an Objectivist rant that if offered 
<br>
such a choice, a person should choose to save their life over that of the 
<br>
rest of humanity.  It felt really wrong but it was a number of years before 
<br>
I understood Hamilton's inclusive fitness and was able to say *why* it felt 
<br>
wrong.
<br>
<p>The most accepted transhumanist meme set includes evolutionary 
<br>
psychology.  If someone wants a political philosophy to go along with 
<br>
transhumanism, they really should  think about basing it on EP at least up 
<br>
to the point we abandon human mental configuration.
<br>
<p>Memetics is really rooted in EP and transhumans tend to be up on memetics 
<br>
as well.  You might be amused that the &quot;meme about memes&quot; set off a major 
<br>
allergic reaction among Libertarians back in the 80s.
<br>
<p>If you want the story, it is in a dozen postings on the memetics list.  If 
<br>
there is interest I could condense it and post it here as a bit of 
<br>
historical trivia.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From your next post down
<br>
<p><em> &gt;The one thing that's likely to trip up Sing Inst is
</em><br>
<em> &gt;their over emphasis on 'altruism'.  Most of the people
</em><br>
<em> &gt;who run around being 'altruistic' get a knife in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;back for their troubles.  Altruism is gonna be Eli's
</em><br>
<em> &gt;down-fall if he's not careful.  Because the Sing Int
</em><br>
<em> &gt;guys are so benign I think they tend to make the
</em><br>
<em> &gt;mistake of thinking that other people are more benign
</em><br>
<em> &gt;than they actually are.
</em><br>
<p>I hope Eliezer has enough insight into both his own motivations and those 
<br>
of other people to keep him and the Institute out of trouble.  If you have 
<br>
not read _Evolution of Cooperation_ by Robert Axelrod, you should.
