<p>Yeah sorry.  'naivete' was the speeling I was looking

</em><br>
<p>Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration may be, but to
<br>
some extent I have to agree with you yes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Soon it will have surveillance

<p>I think we need to organize and get our asses to a
<br>
place where we have friends. 
<br>
<p>The one thing that's likely to trip up Sing Inst is
<br>
their over emphasis on 'altruism'.  Most of the people
<br>
who run around being 'altruistic' get a knife in the
<br>
back for their troubles.  Altruism is gonna be Eli's
<br>
down-fall if he's not careful.  Because the Sing Int
<br>
guys are so benign I think they tend to make the
<br>
mistake of thinking that other people are more benign
<br>
than they actually are.    Let me quote Hollington:
<br>
<p>&quot;A lesson which many gifted persons never learn as
<br>
long as they live is that human beings in general are
<br>
inherently very different from themselves in thought,
<br>
in action, in general intention, and in interests. 
<br>
MANY A REFORMER HAS DIED AT THE HANDS OF A MOB WHICH
<br>
HE WAS TRYING TO IMPROVE in the belief that other
<br>
human beings can and should enjoy what he enjoys&quot;
<br>
<p><p>I don't make that mistake.  That's why I've offically
<br>
signed on for 'The Free State Project' in New
<br>
Hamphire, and am looking to head over there some time
<br>
in the next few years.  Check out my public statement
<br>

<br>
<p><p>I want to built up my own 'network' of allies and
<br>
surround myself with a Libertarian 'Wall of Steel'
<br>
before the shit hits the fan (and it WILL hit the fan
<br>
- you shouldn't kid yoursleves about that).  The
<br>
imagine of the FSP 'Porcupine' is a good one:
<br>
<p>&quot;The porcupine signifies a cute and cuddly creature
<br>
which one is advised to avoid stepping on. This is
<br>
meant to imply that the FSP is friendly and
<br>
non-aggressive, but wants to be left alone and will
<br>
defend itself if attacked.&quot;
