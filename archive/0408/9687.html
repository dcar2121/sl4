</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rule that out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of cource, the first step would be to define what is &quot;physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment&quot; inside a model (in the sense of mathematical logic). If your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axiom-system is suitably large (that is: it allows for simulating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing machine), then it is necessarily non-complete. Even in this case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can reduce the physically sensible manifestation of the model by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restriciting the notion of physical experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Only a mathematician would reply thus!  Anything I can take a bunch of 
<br>
atoms, do, and actually observe, is a legitimate experiment.  The 
<br>
philosophical conundrum would be whether it constitutes a legitimate 
<br>
physical &quot;experiment&quot; to ask, for example, &quot;Does this process *ever* halt?&quot; 
<br>
and not just the experiments &quot;Does this process halt after finite time T1, 
<br>
T2...&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You may be able to reduce the notion of physical experiment so skilfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the outcome of each experiment can be decided by the axioms alone.
</em><br>
<p>The obvious restriction would be physical experiments performed in bounded 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, in this case you cannot tell using experiments in which model 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are.
</em><br>
<p>Let's say that we use a set of axioms that can be satisfied by both the 
<br>
reals and complex numbers, and the axioms uniquely determine the result of 
<br>
any operation applied - analogous to laws of physics with complete 
<br>
determinism and causality.  Or to be more exact, the axioms uniquely 
<br>
determine the relation of an object returned by an operation to any other 
<br>
objects that interact with it - any experimental measurement we can perform 
<br>
will have a result specified by the axioms and the initial conditions.  The 
<br>
experiment &quot;square a particle, and the particle equals negative one&quot;, i.e., 
<br>
1 + square(particle) = 0, tells us that we are in the universe of complex 
<br>
numbers.  Ah, you say, but then the axioms do not determine the result of 
<br>
the experiment:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Otherwise the theory is not complete: it does not describe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical laws completely.
</em><br>
<p>You can have a set of physical laws that don't completely specify the 
<br>
result of every experiment &quot;by itself&quot;, only the result of every experiment 
<br>
given the exact physical setup - the physical data of the initial 
<br>
conditions.  But the initial conditions are data of the model, like 
<br>
pointing to a particular integer in Peano arithmetic (say S(S(S(0)))) that 
<br>
wants to look at the integers around it.
<br>
<p>You can say a good physical theory should also specify the boundary 
<br>
conditions at the initiation of time (the 0), thus determining the entire 
<br>
model, including the fact that I will someday perform a certain experiment. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the question is whether there can be a physical theory that is fully 
<br>
deterministic including determining boundary conditions, where the folks 
<br>
inside can perform an experiment *from within the model* and say, &quot;Ah, we 
<br>
live in an uncountable universe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Maybe to specify the boundary condition of an uncountable model, the 
<br>
physics must include what a human mathematician would call second-order 
<br>
statements.  The Lowenheim-Skolem theorem only applies to first-order 
<br>
statements.  I am told that, e.g., the least upper bound property of the 
<br>
reals can only be specified with a second-order statement.
