</em><br>
<p>My attitude toward mathematics is strongly dependent on relevance - 
<br>
specifically, relevance to an AI theory.  It is not exactly a theorem of 
<br>
Yudkowskian Really Powerful Optimization Process FAI theory that flipping 
<br>
any bit in the RPOP has an expected (probabilistic) effect on the RPOP's 
<br>
real-world actions.  It's not a theorem, but it's a good guideline to the 
<br>
theory.  (In practice, you'd want to code information in less fragile form; 
<br>
but this doesn't change the *probabilistic* effect.)  Suppose the RPOP 
<br>
believes in the axiom of choice.  Now suppose we flip a bit so that the 
<br>
RPOP does not believe in the axiom of choice.  As far as I can tell this 
<br>
makes absolutely no difference to the RPOP's actions, not even a 
<br>
probabilistic difference, which places the Axiom of Choice entirely outside 
<br>
the conceptual universe and ontology of an RPOP - you can't even translate 
<br>
the question into RPOP-language.  If it's a Collective Volition RPOP, the 
<br>
RPOP can ask whether a human is likely to believe in the Axiom of Choice, 
<br>
but not whether the Axiom of Choice is &quot;true&quot;; it's like asking about 
<br>
whether free will exists.  You can ask whether humans think &quot;free will&quot; 
<br>
exists, but not ask whether free will actually exists.
<br>
<p>Anyway, the upshot is that I acknowledge the existence of only those math 
<br>
questions which can affect an RPOP action.  This is the hidden, underlying 
<br>
motivation behind my infinite set atheism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;1+1=2&quot; is an absolute statement which is indisputable. One reason for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, that it does not include quantors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There is an odd perfect number&quot; has a high relevance, since it can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuted by giving an example. Its independence to any reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axiom-system would prove its validity. This shows that this statement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat absolute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;There are infinitely many prime numbers&quot; is less absolute, but it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still quite absolute, since you can show a concrete Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generating them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Every Goodstein sequence stops&quot; is even less absolute since you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither refute it nor exhibit some sequence of objects supporting it.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Every Goodstein sequence stops&quot; is relevant to an RPOP.  If the RPOP for 
<br>
some reason needs to compute whether a physically instantiated Goodstein 
<br>
sequence halts, the RPOP must separately prove that Goodstein stops for 
<br>
each relevant N, if the RPOP is using Peano axioms.  While if the RPOP uses 
<br>
ZFC, the RPOP will be able to decide once and for all that every Goodstein 
<br>
sequence stops, then just retrieve the fact from memory on each relevant 
<br>
occasion.  This is not only more efficient, it makes ZFC a more *compressed 
<br>
explanation* for the behavior of natural numbers (and hence, physical 
<br>
processes) than Peano Arithmetic.  This is a reason for adopting ZFC as an 
<br>
&quot;explanation&quot; for observed math, by the law of Occam's Razor.  Adopting ZFC 
<br>
would then be like adopting a physical hypothesis that enables us to deduce 
<br>
conservation of momentum; as opposed to PA recording the history of every 
<br>
known finite physics experiment in which momentum has been conserved, 
<br>
without allowing us to generalize a universal quantifier.
<br>
<p>I wish I knew exactly *which* axioms of ZFC allow mathematicians to 
<br>
conclude that every Goodstein sequence stops!  Which specific aspect of ZFC 
<br>
makes ZFC a more compressed explanation for real-world physical behaviors 
<br>
than PA?  I doubt the Axiom of Choice has anything to do with it.  But I 
<br>
would be forced to believe in infinite sets if they were the simplest 
<br>
explanation for the behavior of the Goodstein sequence, and there was no 
<br>
simpler explanation that did not postulate infinite sets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The axiom of choice is even less absolute. It cannot be refuted or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supported by any examples. I don't know of any interpretation which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holds any information about the &quot;real world&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>On this, of course, we are in agreement.
