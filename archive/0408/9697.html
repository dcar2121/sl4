<p>Sure.  However, the connection between falling income per capita and war 
<br>
mode can be stated in a few sentences, it is backed up by much historical 
<br>
data and has a sound EP model behind it.  The logic flow is that rising 
<br>
income per capita shuts off the human psychological traits that lead to 
<br>
wars or related social disruptions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I can certainly demonstrate that wealth such as the Saudi's obtained from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;oil had little to do with a non-initiation of force as a political philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Saudis would have had to have a very dysfunctional political

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That depends on the time frame you take, from the peak to a few years ago a 
<br>
combination of falling oil prices and rising population reduced the income 
<br>
per capita by 75%.  There are other factors, but it is worth noting that 15 
<br>
of the 19 9/11 hijackers were Saudi.  If oil doubles in price, their income 
<br>
doubles, but over time their population growth (birth control is outlawed) 
<br>
will eat up any possible increases in revenue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I also think that if Easter Island had been populated entirely with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;libertarians just before their 90-95% population crash it would have made 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;no difference.  (Except perhaps in the names of the memes each side used 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to dehumanize the other side prior to killing them.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know to what extent the Easter Islanders would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;helped by a market system, since I know little about that situation.
</em><br>
<p>It would be well worth reading about it.

<p>I draw somewhat different information from this tragedy than Jared Diamond 
<br>
did, but I don't think more of a market system than they had would have 
<br>
been of any help.
