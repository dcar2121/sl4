</em><br>
<p>BTW, I'm not trying to place blame on Tyler - rather, the interview sort of
<br>
just happened one day, and then it just happened to get posted to SIAI's
<br>
website.  It's not a major, edited, composed document.  It's an IRC
<br>
interview with punctuation.  I was aware the interview was getting posted 
<br>
to SIAI's website, but I couldn't bring myself to read it because of the 
<br>
two-years rule.  I can't read anything I wrote two or more years ago.  When 
<br>
I try my brain shuts down and refuses to function, like a compiler that 
<br>
generates too many error messages.  In 2004 someone said they wanted to 
<br>
post the interview to intelligence.org.  As I could no longer actually read it, 
<br>
I just gritted my teeth and hoped that whatever unknown stuff was in the 
<br>
interview, it wasn't too awful.  I'm trying hard to steer clear of website 
<br>
issues, tick tick tick.
<br>
<p>What I'm working up to here is that this wasn't a major, planned, 
<br>
stab-Eugen-in-the-back diabolical plot.  Back in 2002, Tyler asked me, over 
<br>
IRC, what my response was to your position, so I, off-the-cuff, summarized 
<br>
your position as best I could.  Feel free to provide a more appropriate 
<br>
characterization of your positions.  By default SIAI is just taking down 
<br>
that section entirely.
