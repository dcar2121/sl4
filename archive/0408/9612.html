</em><br>
<p>I don't claim to know how or why it is so, but it seems obvious enough that 
<br>
our physical universe is a manifestation of that which we name 
<br>
&quot;mathematics&quot; - maybe even in the sense of our physical universe being a 
<br>
model which satisfies an axiomatic system, but I'm still studying 
<br>
mathematical logic so it's too early for me to speculate coherently about that.
<br>
<p>Geddes credits the speculation that all is math and all math exists to 
<br>
Tegmark, Geddes didn't make it up himself.  Nor did Tegmark devise it; if I 
<br>
recall correctly &quot;all is math&quot; goes back to Pythagoras, and I don't know 
<br>
who first speculated that everything exists.  I agree that a statement like 
<br>
&quot;all is number&quot; is unsuitable for use as an axiom, but Geddes did not call 
<br>
it an axiom.  It would only be an &quot;axiom&quot; if Geddes were making logical 
<br>
deductions conditional upon it, without asserting that the axiom itself 
<br>
were true or false.  In modern-day mathematics, axioms are strictly empty 
<br>
of empirical content.  That's what makes them axioms.  (All the more 
<br>
ironic, then, if our universe is a model satisfying an axiomatic system; 
<br>
everything that we call an &quot;empirical&quot; fact would simply be a consequence, 
<br>
relative to our location, of the axioms in which we happen to be embedded.) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who believe the universe is math are driven to that conclusion by 
<br>
the astonishing empirical suitability of math as a system for describing 
<br>
the universe and the internal consistency of physics - it's clear that this 
<br>
is a very basic thing, but to call it an axiom is inappropriate.  That is 
<br>
not the right name for basic things we don't understand.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, Geddes's statements about MWI in QM are wrong.  MWI does not 
<br>
interact with the &quot;everything exists&quot; hypothesis, nor is MWI *in QM* a 
<br>
consequence of the &quot;everything exists&quot; hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Also, Geddes, kindly do not call it &quot;Yudkowsky's arrow of morality&quot; for I 
<br>
never said such a thing.
