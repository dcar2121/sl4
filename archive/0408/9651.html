Math is

</em><br>
good at 
<br>
<em>&gt; *communicating* the actual experience of our world to other human

beings, in 
<br>
<em>&gt; certain ways that we've found useful in the course of our evolution.
</em><br>
If you 
<br>
<em>&gt; say, &quot;being on stage made me feel like I had butterflies in my stomach,&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even someone who has never heard that expression used will nonetheless
</em><br>
get a 
<br>
<em>&gt; vivid impression of the experience you are describing.
</em><br>
<p><p>Rephrasing the point doesn't change its content.  The only reason
<br>
communication seems &quot;compressed&quot; is because most humans are carrying
<br>
around some approximation of the same learned coding table in their
<br>
brains for expanding those words into additional information.  If you
<br>
add the coding table (itself a finite pattern) with the finite word
<br>
pattern, you'll *still* end up with a finite mathematical pattern. 
<br>
Layers of abstraction exist for the sake of efficiency and do not change
<br>
the basic nature of the patterns contained in the abstractions.
<br>
<p>I'm pretty sure the math of all this has been argued before on SL4. 
<br>
This entire discussion is reflogging the long-dead horse of arbitrary
<br>
and infinite compression, not a productive pursuit.  A rigorous
<br>
construction of the question would have made it obvious, but instead we
<br>
are getting caught up in semantics.
