Hi Peter ;-) 
<br>
<p>I've looked at these things before, and I'm posting publicly in case
<br>
it's useful for others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm looking for price &amp; performance (access time) for: 
</em><br>
<p>prices vary a great deal based on what kind of support/branding you
<br>
need, and what you're willing to go through. I'll try to note relative
<br>
price points, where I have them.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;1) Cached RAID 
</em><br>
<p>RAID 0 is very fast with new hard drives, more than fast enough to
<br>
saturate a PCI bus. Even RAID 5 with SCSI or fast SATA drives(like the
<br>
10,000 RPM models begin to require PCI-X for full functionality.
<br>
<p>with RAID 0 on a eight disk SATA array with Raptor 10,000 drives, your
<br>
possible  throughput would be 480MB/s, there are some benchmarks
<br>
showing actual performance here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/storage/20031114/">http://www.tomshardware.com/storage/20031114/</a>
<br>
<p>price point for that setup is $1550, according to froogle. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2) RAM disks 
</em><br>
<p>There are PCI card mounted RAM disky things, which I've seen used
<br>
before. Performance was not inspiring, topping out at 150 MB/s, and
<br>
very costly. Normal RAM prices, plus premiums for manufacturing. I
<br>
wouldn't recommend it. Those were a few years ago, and they may have
<br>
more intelligent controllers, bursting, etc, nowadays. Google
<br>
unfortunately doesn't return many hits on the subject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3) Internal RAM (using 64 bit architecture?) 
</em><br>
<p>there are opteron motherboards on the market right now that can mount
<br>
16 GB of memory with 2G chips. Windows can't mount the whole space, at
<br>
the moment, but expectations are high for a x86-64 version of windows
<br>
that can. If you wanted to be very expensive, there is an Itanium
<br>
version of windows, which may be able to mount large amounts of
<br>
internal RAM. I don't have any data on that.
<br>
<p>there are of course, PowerMacs shipping with up to 8 GB of memory
<br>
directly from the Apple Store, which is interesting to see.
<br>
<p>For this option, which isn't yet feasible, you see $650+ for each 2GB
<br>
dimm, and at least $350 for a motherboard with 8 slots. plus cpu
<br>
costs, attendant hardware, etc etc.  which vary much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;4) other 
</em><br>
<p>If it doesn't have to be on the computer, there are network storage
<br>
solutions, many of which are very fast, requiring Fibre to keep up.
<br>
<p>they are attendantly very very expensive. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
tip top are things like RAM-SAN: <a href="http://www.superssd.com/products_sub.htm">http://www.superssd.com/products_sub.htm</a>
<br>
<p>more commodity esque, you have things like Apple's Xserv RAID, and
<br>
knockoffs. (a note, Xserv RAID will work in a windows environment, and
<br>
there are more.. wintel solutions available, if you want them, I'm
<br>
just not familiar, because they are either more expensive, or newer
<br>
than I've looked).
<br>
<p>There are also nifty tricks you can do with a small network of
<br>
computers. in terms of building virtual disks out of internal ram, and
<br>
sharing them as network drives in arrays or with intermediate
<br>
controllers. This is a spooky and complicated subject, which Linux
<br>
probably has more solutions in. But I have old or unreliable
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>hope this is useful.
