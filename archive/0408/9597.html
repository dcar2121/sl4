<p>
Most Singularitarians I've talked to, at some point, question if the 
<br>
Singularity is pseudo-science (or, worse yet, a cult).  I've just 
<br>
finished reading Martin Gardner's /Fads and Fallacies in the Name of 
<br>
Science/ (1957, ISBN:489-20394-8), and in it he includes five behaviors 
<br>
that tend to be exhibited by pseudo-scientists (Gardner's position is 
<br>
that pseudo-scientists all exhibit some degree of paranoia).  The 
<br>
following is an abridged version of Gardner's descriptions:
<br>
<p>(1)  He considers himself a genius.
<br>
(2)  He regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant 
<br>
blockheads.
<br>
(3)  He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against.
<br>
(4)  He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the greatest 
<br>
scientists and the best-established theories.
<br>
(5)  He often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many 
<br>
cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined.
<br>
<p>If these characteristics frequently correlate with pseudo-science, as 
<br>
Gardner and his examples show and my own intuition suggests, it's easy 
<br>
to see how the presence of these characteristics, especially more than 
<br>
one, could trigger a person to think that something is pseudo-science.
<br>
<p>For example, if we give one point for exhibiting each behavior above, 
<br>
I'd probably score Eliezer between 2 to 2.5.  Combined with the 
<br>
incredible claims of Singularitarians, it's easy to see why the &quot;might 
<br>
be pseudo-science or cult&quot; condition is triggered in our minds.
<br>
<p>* * *
<br>
<p>To head off a discussion that will probably be uninteresting and 
<br>
produce more noise than signal, this should not be used as proof that 
<br>
the Singularity is not a cult.  Nor is it evidence that the Singularity 
<br>
is a cult.  I choose to look at it more as identifying characteristics 
<br>
of pseudo-science and cults and note that the Singularity movement 
<br>
shares some of them, but no matter what someone or something may look 
<br>
like, it matters what it is.  Scientology, flat Earth, Psychoanalysis, 
<br>
the Singularity, etc. should be properly assessed, not deemed true or 
<br>
false based on how much they represent the classes cult or real 
<br>
science.
