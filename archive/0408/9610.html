<p>
O.K, boys and girls.  Here's the quick summary of my
<br>
full and final theory of morality.  This is also now
<br>
posted on my web-site as a part of my
<br>
'Libertarian-Transhumanist Philosophical Platform',
<br>
Version 2.0.  I've expanded the first draft quite a
<br>
bit.  A number of transhumanists are mentioned there,
<br>
including Eliezer.  I don't want to mis-represent
<br>
anyone here, so if you think you see something
<br>
seriously wrong don't hesitate to e-mail me so I can
<br>
modify the offending section.

Fundamental Principles of Morality'

<br>
<p>The Equivalence of Mind and Morality: How Volitional
<br>
Consciousness Creates Values
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Good and Evil are categories of value judgment about
<br>
various things.  Value judgments imply ideals, or
<br>
goals towards which moral agents aim to strive.  This
<br>
in turns requires consciousness and the experience of
<br>
conscious choice, which exist in minds.  Since there
<br>
are no supernatural minds in existence in reality,
<br>
good and evil must be generated by the minds of
<br>
ordinary mortal beings, like humans.  So Good and Evil
<br>
are not objective properties of reality in the same
<br>
way that mathematical or physical facts are, since
<br>
they are in part created by the choices that humans
<br>
make.  But the choices that people make will be
<br>
heavily influenced by human nature itself.  Minds
<br>
require brains shaped by our biological heritage. 
<br>
Evolutionary psychology studies how human morals stem
<br>
from the forces of biological evolution.  People's
<br>
choices will also be influenced by the social
<br>
environment.  The theory of memes is concerned with
<br>
the spread of cultural ideas.
<br>
<p>But exactly what is the nature of choice?  Philosopher
<br>
Ayn Rand proposed that free will is a function of the
<br>
capacity to think rationally.  In other words, one can
<br>
expand ones volitional consciousness (free will) to
<br>
the extent that one can think rationally.  Developing
<br>
this idea, I propose that in this context rational
<br>
thinking makes the ability to imagine a number of
<br>
different possible choices and to rationally calculate
<br>
the consequences of each.  It is the sense of time, or
<br>
ability to project one's imagination into the future,
<br>
combined with the creative and rational faculties to
<br>
imagine new possibilities and to understand the
<br>
consequences of each that generates morality.  The
<br>
very essence of morality is rational choice.  This is
<br>
a form of existentialist philosophy, the idea that we
<br>
are in the process of changing our very essence by the
<br>
choices we make. 
<br>
<p>The fallacy of moral skepticism and the existence of
<br>
moral universals
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The fact that morality is generated by minds does not
<br>
mean that morality is wholly arbitrary.  Moral
<br>
relativists will try to claim all morality is relative
<br>
to some particular cultural group or even individual
<br>
people.  All moralities are equal they say.  A few
<br>
people take this to the extreme and say that morality
<br>
is entirely relative to individuals.  This is radical
<br>
moral skepticism.
<br>
<p>But morality is not wholly relative.  As explained,
<br>
the nature of a mind will be heavily influenced by its
<br>
physical substrate.  In humans that is our biological
<br>
evolutionary heritage.  Another point to note that
<br>
there is no such thing as a group mind.  So human
<br>
wants and needs reside in individual minds, which
<br>
exist quite independently of social institutions such
<br>
as government.
<br>
<p>There should exist general characteristics that
<br>
virtually all rational beings (like humans) have in
<br>
common, emerging from their basic natures.  These
<br>
universals can form the basis for universal standards
<br>
of moral judgment, standards that all rational beings
<br>
can agree to.  We can call these moral universals. 
<br>
Three universal moral principles will be suggested in
<br>
the next two sections.  Within the framework of a few
<br>
general universal principles, a broad diversity of
<br>
positive moralities would be possible.  But they would
<br>
be judged by the established universal standards.  
<br>
<p>Interpersonal conduct: Egoism versus Altruism and the
<br>
difference between Rights and Values.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
When considering interpersonal conduct, it is
<br>
important to draw a sharp distinction between Rights
<br>
and Values.  Rights are our obligations to other moral
<br>
agents.  Values suggest personal goals we can chose to
<br>
pursue.    Just because moral agents have values, this
<br>
certainly doesn't necessarily give them the right to
<br>
impose these values upon others!  As a general rule of
<br>
thumb, Rights are a guide to what we shouldn't do. 
<br>
Values are more positive in that they suggest what we
<br>
should do.  The theory of Rights will be explained in
<br>
the sections on 'Politics'.  The following sections
<br>
discuss Values.  The suggested ethical principles in
<br>
these sections are only intended as guides to
<br>
individual personal conduct, not legal principles.
<br>
<p>Is it better to act in one's own rational
<br>
self-interest or for the benefit of others with no
<br>
expectation of personal gain?  Egoist theories of
<br>
morality propose that a person's actions are not moral
<br>
unless they always produce such benefit for that
<br>
person.  Altruists say the opposite: a person must act
<br>
selflessly for the benefit of others in order to be
<br>
moral.  Neither egoism nor altruism is a good guide to
<br>
moral behavior.  Altruism fails to take into properly
<br>
take into account the moral values of the Self (Moral
<br>
Agent), Egoism fails to properly take into account the
<br>
moral rights of others.  A viable moral theory must
<br>
take into consideration the moral values and rights of
<br>
all moral agents.
<br>
<p>The approach known as Utilitarianism is the right one.
<br>
&nbsp;Here the moral values and rights of all moral agents
<br>
are taken into account.  The idea is that we should
<br>
act in such a way as to maximize the overall
<br>
satisfaction of the wants and needs of all agents
<br>
potentially interacting with each other in some group.
<br>
&nbsp;A mixture of altruism and egoism will be needed.  On
<br>
the average agents will benefit from following this
<br>
morality, but sometimes they will need to make some
<br>
degree of sacrifice for others.  In practice what is
<br>
happening is trade-offs between different values.  In
<br>
the sections that follow the proposed moral universals
<br>
are meant to be applied in a Utilitarian sense: we
<br>
should be looking to maximize the overall value in a
<br>
society as a whole.
<br>
<p>Perfectionist ethics
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
There is no reason for thinking that humans are the
<br>
end of the evolutionary process.  On the contrary it
<br>
is likely that they were merely the beginning.  It is
<br>
possible for beings to exist with cognitive and
<br>
physical abilities as far beyond those of humans as
<br>
humans abilities are beyond those of slugs.  Since
<br>
values are generated by our capacity for imagination
<br>
and rational thinking, we could enhance meaning and
<br>
value by enhancing our innate abilities.  The
<br>
Universal principle here is self-improvement.  
<br>
<p>It is a mistake to assume that what is natural is
<br>
necessarily good.  Aids, small-pox and cancer were all
<br>
natural.   Humans should regard reality as a work of
<br>
art in progress and aim to perfect themselves,
<br>
utilizing science, technology and critical thinking to
<br>
deliberately enhance human mental and physical
<br>
characteristics towards this end.  
<br>
<p>Humans should seek to transcend to Post-human states. 
<br>
This does not mean a total alteration of human nature.
<br>
&nbsp;Instead it means seeking to enable the positive
<br>
aspects of human nature to better flourish, whilst
<br>
countering the negative.
<br>
<p>Transhumanist Max More was the first to develop these
<br>
ideas in a comprehensive way, through his Extropian
<br>
philosophy.  The heroic idea of the super-man
<br>
'over-coming' through acts of will is strongly echoed
<br>
in the much earlier philosophy of Nietzsche, who also
<br>
used the metaphor of life as a work of art in
<br>
progress. 
<br>
<p>Immortalist ethics
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Minds generate values.  But minds cannot continue to
<br>
do this if minds cease to exist.  The longer the
<br>
possible future before us, the greater the range of
<br>
choices open us, and hence the more potential meaning
<br>
and value.  Long lives give us the potential to learn
<br>
more and encourage longer-range thinking, things that
<br>
will tend to make us more moral.  It's clear that the
<br>
meaning of a person's life does in part depend on its
<br>
length.  This can be taken as the grounding for a
<br>
Universal ethics.  
<br>
<p>Humans should aim to take those actions which enhance
<br>
their own survival prospects and avoid those actions
<br>
which degrade their own survival prospects.  The
<br>
derived moral imperative is that humans should strive
<br>
to lengthen their life spans by making rational
<br>
life-affirming choices and pursuing radical life
<br>
extension technologies.  It's possible that the risk
<br>
of death can never be reduced to zero, but can be
<br>
continuously reduced over an indefinite time frame
<br>
through a never ending application of ever greater
<br>
ingenuity and technology.  Thus immortality in the
<br>
sense of indestructibility would be impossible, but
<br>
immortality in the sense of indefinite life span would
<br>
be possible.  
<br>
<p>The idea of attempting to ground a universal ethics in
<br>
an affirmation of life has been used by such notables
<br>
as philosopher Ayn Rand (although in an egoist sense,
<br>
versus a Utilitarian sense here) and German
<br>
philosopher Albert Schweitzer.  I myself first
<br>
developed the ideas summarized here in an essay
<br>
published for the book 'The Scientific Conquest Of
<br>
Death' ('An Introduction to Immortalist Morality')
<br>
<p>Epicurean ethics
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Immortalist ethics and perfectionist ethics suggest
<br>
general universal goals for rational beings to pursue,
<br>
providing a standard for judging positive and negative
<br>
choices.  Yet clearly a huge (in fact an infinite!)
<br>
diversity of sub-goals is consistent with these
<br>
broader goals.  Since all such sub-goals are by
<br>
definition good, it would be a tragedy not to explore
<br>
as many of them as possible.  All of us are unique. 
<br>
To learn something new is to interact with it in a
<br>
unique way, and hence convey new meaning and value
<br>
upon it.  
<br>
<p>Given these points, more universal principles present
<br>
themselves:  to value diversity, complexity and
<br>
novelty for their own sakes.  In fact humans are
<br>
hard-wired to experience a certain amount of pleasure
<br>
in such things.  An Epicurean Imperative expands our
<br>
horizons greatly.  New knowledge, new art, new food,
<br>
new places, new people, all greatly enhance avenues
<br>
for positive experiences.  Hand in hand with learning
<br>
and understands comes the value of tolerance.  Because
<br>
such a diverse range of positive values are possible,
<br>
we must totally respect view-points other than our
<br>
own. 
<br>
<p>Extrapolated Volition and Collective Volition: 
<br>
Yudkowsky's arrow of morality
<br>
<p>We can combine all the ideas in this section to obtain
<br>
an understanding of what morality is.  What a person
<br>
currently values is not necessarily what is moral.  As
<br>
explained, the ability to create and act upon one's
<br>
values is limited by the capacity for creative and
<br>
rational thinking relevant to imagining and
<br>
calculating future outcomes.  The general nature of
<br>
rational beings with volitional consciousness (like
<br>
humans) establishes moral universals.  The very
<br>
process of seeking values creates values.  
<br>
<p>If we lived long enough to think deeply (a requirement
<br>
leading to Immoralist ethics), acquired lots of
<br>
interesting life experience and knowledge (a
<br>
requirement leading to Epicurean ethics) and were
<br>
smarter and more imaginative (a requirement leading to
<br>
Perfectionist ethics) we would better be able to make
<br>
creative and rational choices.  This defines a sort of
<br>
'arrow of morality' moving into the future.  
<br>
<p>Again, Existentialist philosophy is useful here.  The
<br>
current meaning of our lives depends on the person we
<br>
should aim to become: our wiser, future selves.  A
<br>
wiser possible future version ourselves represents our
<br>
'Extrapolated Volition'.  In accordance with
<br>
Utilitarianism, this idea has to be applied on a
<br>
social level, as well as an individual level.  Then we
<br>
obtain an arrow of morality for society as a whole,
<br>
the 'Collective Volition'.  The terms 'Extrapolated
<br>
Volition' and 'Collective Volition' were first
<br>
developed and explored in depth by artificial
<br>
intelligence scientist Eliezer Yudkowsky. 
<br>
Extrapolating Volition further and further into the
<br>
future defines increasing goodness.  To seek values is
<br>
to create values and the created values further the
<br>
seeking.  That's what morality is.
