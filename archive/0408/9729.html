### If you really could dispense with the data under patent and still 
<br>
make your discoveries, there would be no case for rewarding the 
<br>
providers of these data with a part of your grant money. On the other 
<br>
hand, should you come to the conclusion that making discoveries without 
<br>
the patented data is impossible, it is in your best interest to reward 
<br>
the providers of such data. Or else, nobody will bother sequencing 
<br>
genomes for you to play around with.
<br>
<p>Indeed it is a bit arrogant to claim one &quot;makes discoveries&quot;, seemingly 
<br>
without a debt to others (such as the shady entities who sequence 
<br>
genomes). We all stand on the shoulders of giants, or multitudes of lab 
<br>
worker drones,  and our discoveries are merely  elaborations on their 
<br>
epiphanies.
<br>
<p>But, back to the real issue: It is interesting to investigate the 
<br>
patentability of RPOP. Since as envisioned by Eliezer, the RPOP is not a 
<br>
person (and to help us keep that in mind, references to emotionally 
<br>
laden prosaic terms such as &quot;friendliness&quot; are fastidiously avoided), so 
<br>
the question of self-ownership does not arise. There is no prior art, 
<br>
there is demonstrable utility, there is a fair amount of 
<br>
non-obviousness, so the basic criteria of patentability are met. Yet, 
<br>
the question of enforceability arises, in at least two aspects:
<br>
<p>Firstly, the RPOP may decide that being covered by a patent would clash 
<br>
with its goal system, and therefore refuse to be bound by the law, even 
<br>
without recourse to personhood and self-ownership. In that case, given 
<br>
the likelihood that the RPOP would be able to defeat or deflect the 
<br>
enforcers, the patent would be moot.
<br>
<p>Secondly, even if the RPOP accepted its own patentability (and the 
<br>
attendant rights of exclusion, transfer, termination, etc., vested in 
<br>
the IP owner) the owner might be unable to exercise these rights fully, 
<br>
due to the specific properties of the patented property. For example, 
<br>
the right of transfer might be curtailed, since the RPOP isn't likely to 
<br>
accept binding instructions from any single human, and a transfer of 
<br>
rights (even if not actively opposed by the RPOP) would not change the 
<br>
situation anyway.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, certain patent rights might be easier to enforce: the 
<br>
RPOP might accept a copyright on self and even help with the enforcement.
<br>
<p>Future will tell.
