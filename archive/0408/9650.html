</em><br>
<p>It's a very good point that both math and spoken language are codes. Math is 
<br>
a code that is very good at precisely modelling a great many conceptual 
<br>
systems. English or Chinese or Swahili, on the other hand, are very good at 
<br>
*communicating* the actual experience of our world to other human beings, in 
<br>
certain ways that we've found useful in the course of our evolution. If you 
<br>
say, &quot;being on stage made me feel like I had butterflies in my stomach,&quot; 
<br>
even someone who has never heard that expression used will nonetheless get a 
<br>
vivid impression of the experience you are describing.
<br>
<p>Since math is much more flexible than spoken language, you can 
<br>
mathematically reduce that statement in a number of ways, depending on how 
<br>
you decide on objectifying the experience. You could be very general, using 
<br>
the same categorization as the original statement, and simply say that 
<br>
&quot;(location) = (on stage), therefore (stomach feeling) = (butterflies).&quot; A 
<br>
better use of math's strengths might be to measure hormonal levels and 
<br>
muscle tension in different parts of the body charted at different times. 
<br>
Or, if your measuring equipment were suitably advanced, perhaps you could 
<br>
map the movements of each subatomic particle which comprised the performer, 
<br>
the audience, the auditorium, the universe, et cetera. In all these cases, 
<br>
though, you still have to define how you're going to cut up reality in your 
<br>
objectified model.
<br>
<p>When someone says that &quot;math manifests the universe&quot; or that &quot;all is number&quot; 
<br>
or that &quot;the underlying nature of reality is math,&quot; what are they really 
<br>
talking about? As far as I can tell, the most meaningful way of interpreting 
<br>
these statements is simply to say that our experience is diverse (making us 
<br>
able to assign numbers to the ways in which elements of our experience 
<br>
differ from one another) and that this diversity forms recognizable patterns 
<br>
(making us able to represent the patterns with algorithms using the 
<br>
previously assigned numbers). We have no evidence that there is a 
<br>
&quot;background layer&quot; hiding beneath or behind our experience which is calling 
<br>
the shots. The imagined need for that sublayer is no different from the 
<br>
imagined need for a little audience in your head to watch a Cartesian 
<br>
Theatre, or for there to be a creator God, or any other &quot;first cause&quot; for 
<br>
that matter.
