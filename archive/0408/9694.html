</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, I disagree.  I think that at root the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fundamental 'explanatory' principles of reality form a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unified whole which encompasses metaphysics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;epistemology, ethics and politics.  Popper's

<em>&gt;Pan-Critical Rationalism is a good approximation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Bayesian ideal capable of dealing with ALL aspects
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of reality.  I think reason truly is all encompassing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Reason can even *partially* (but not entirely) tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;us what to value.
</em><br>
<p>We already know what we value.  But to understand *why* we value certain 
<br>
things you have to view the world from a genes &quot;viewpoint.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think many modern philosophers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and scientists realize this, but they're too scared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say it.  They're 'keeping their heads down' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;staying out of ethics and politics for pragmatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transhumanism is a view of a future with lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technologically derived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; changes in it, up to and including fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; changes in humans.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rooted in reasonable extrapolations of technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; progress.  I was at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an observer as the aspects of the transhumanism view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of our future developed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Libertarianism is a political philosophy about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proper/ideal relation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans to each other.  Heinlein was the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political/philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; influence in my formative years so you have to rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me as at least as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lower case libertarian.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, libertarianism, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Libertarianism&quot; is rooted in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; air--as are all political philosophies.  Infection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with the Libertarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meme set too often results in uncompromising people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with very poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political skills.  The only people worse off are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Objectivists/Randroids.  I think I know why if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are interested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, there are 'degrees' of Libertarianism.  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course any political philosophy has its crack-pots and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extremist elements.  It's more accurate to say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm a 'Semi-Libertarian'.  I don't think individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rights are an absolute.  I subscribe to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Utilitarian approach
</em><br>
<p>And what is that based on?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;of people like Richard Epstein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And that's the sensible position that most moderates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seem to come around to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Take out the anarchist extremists and crack-pots and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moderate the movement somewhat and there's a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;viable politics there.
</em><br>
<p>If that is the case, then why are libertarian policies not the norm?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I remember years and years ago hearing an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Objectivist rant that if offered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such a choice, a person should choose to save their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life over that of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of humanity.  It felt really wrong but it was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number of years before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I understood Hamilton's inclusive fitness and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; able to say *why* it felt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Be careful not to equate Libertarianism with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Objectivism.  Thankfully, most Libertarians are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Objectivists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I spent quite a few months visiting an NZ Objectivist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;web-site, trying to persuade Objectivists there to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;look into Transhumanism, Bayesian reasoning and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;altruism but it was hopeless.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  You were trying to communicate with minds taken over by 
<br>
Objectivist/Rand cult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  They just spat bile at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me.  I've now totally given up on those guys.  They're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather like religious fundamentalists actually.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gonna steer well clear of those idiots from now on.
</em><br>
<p>It is very much worth while trying to generalize your experience.  I have 
<br>
not only the scientology cult as a sample, but the L5 Society (which 
<br>
certainly had cult aspects to it).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I did used to toy with egoism as a viable ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory but I've rejected it now.  I think pure egoism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is just as flawed as pure altruism.  I finally settled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on good old Utilitarianism with a mixture of altruism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and egoism.
</em><br>
<p>As long as you are not hung up on Utilitarianism with a capital U, you 
<br>
might consider taking a look at evolutionary psychology as a foundation 
<br>
upon which to base reasoning about human motivations, drives, psychological 
<br>
traits, behavioral switches and the like.  I suspect you will come to much 
<br>
the same conclusions, but based on a logical extension up from evolutionary 
<br>
biology.  (Which is of course based at the root on chemistry, which is 
<br>
based on physics.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The most accepted transhumanist meme set includes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; psychology.  If someone wants a political philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to go along with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanism, they really should  think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; basing it on EP at least up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the point we abandon human mental configuration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yup, I agree with you there.  That's why in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'platform' I said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;So Good and Evil are not objective properties of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality in the same way that mathematical or physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;facts are, since they are in part created by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;choices that humans make.  But the choices that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make will be heavily influenced by human nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;itself.  Minds require brains shaped by our biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heritage.  Evolutionary psychology studies how human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morals stem from the forces of biological evolution.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;But morality is not wholly relative.  As explained,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nature of a mind will be heavily influenced by its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical substrate.  In humans that is our biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolutionary heritage.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;There should exist general characteristics that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;virtually all rational beings (like humans) have in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;common, emerging from their basic natures.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You might consider taking this seriously.  I am far from the final word on 
<br>
this subject, but you might want to look at the first link for sex drugs 
<br>
cults for a start.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Memetics is really rooted in EP and transhumans tend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be up on memetics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as well.  You might be amused that the &quot;meme about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; memes&quot; set off a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allergic reaction among Libertarians back in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 80s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you want the story, it is in a dozen postings on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the memetics list.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is interest I could condense it and post it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; here as a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; historical trivia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I haven't heard the story.  Post a little about it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;here if you want.
</em><br>
<p>It will take a bit of effort since it was spread over more than a dozen 
<br>
posting on the memetics list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  From your next post down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;The one thing that's likely to trip up Sing Inst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;their over emphasis on 'altruism'.  Most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;who run around being 'altruistic' get a knife in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;back for their troubles.  Altruism is gonna be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eli's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;down-fall if he's not careful.  Because the Sing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Int
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;guys are so benign I think they tend to make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;mistake of thinking that other people are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  &gt;than they actually are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I hope Eliezer has enough insight into both his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; motivations and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of other people to keep him and the Institute out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trouble.  If you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not read _Evolution of Cooperation_ by Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Axelrod, you should.
