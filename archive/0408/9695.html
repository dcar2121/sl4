<p>I don't believe you can demonstrate this.  I can certainly demonstrate that 
<br>
wealth such as the Saudi's obtained from oil had little to do with a 
<br>
non-initiation of force as a political philosophy.  I also think that if 
<br>
Easter Island had been populated entirely with libertarians just before 
<br>
their 90-95% population crash it would have made no difference.  (Except 
<br>
perhaps in the names of the memes each side used to dehumanize the other 
<br>
side prior to killing them.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It's unclear at this time whether it will

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If my thesis about the &quot;war switch&quot; is right, then general increasing 
<br>
wealth greater than population growth will keep humans out of war mode.
<br>
<p>Along such lines, as long as China has increasing wealth per capita, I 
<br>
predict they will not start a war.  (They can still be attacked and that 
<br>
will set off a war.)  But if they suffer economic reversals, the social 
<br>
forces leading them toward war will be considerable.
<br>
<p>Consider Argentina and the Falklands war if you want a clear example.

<p>PS.  Wars are *adaptive* for hunter gatherer societies.  That does not make 
<br>
necessarily make wars adaptive to later societies.
