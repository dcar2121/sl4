</em><br>
<p>This was Tyler interviewing me over IRC, (long) before Tyler was attached 
<br>
to SIAI.  The &quot;&quot; is definitely not verbatim and you're correct, I should 
<br>
not have given that impression.  The raison d'etre of this interview was 
<br>
that it would not require four months for me to write up; I would provide 
<br>
the interview off-the-cuff, over IRC, and Tyler would edit the information. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out that we had different ideas of what &quot;editing&quot; meant - I 
<br>
thought it meant rewriting the raw information from scratch to express the 
<br>
same ideas, Tyler thought it meant adding punctuation and capitalizing the 
<br>
sentences.  (Again, this was all back in 2002.)  I'm not currently in the 
<br>
loop for SIAI website control; occasionally things I write get posted to it 
<br>
somewhere, if Tyler or Anissimov thinks they sound useful.
<br>
<p>However, that which I have attributed to you, Eugen, still seems *to me* to 
<br>
be an accurate representation of views you expressed on the Extropians 
<br>
mailing list, the SL4 mailing list, and the wta-talk mailing list, 
<br>
regarding the dominance of Darwinian dynamics over the SI realm, the 
<br>
theoretical impossibility of Friendly or even friendly SI, and your 
<br>
preferred strategy for handling it (forcible uploading).  That's why I am 
<br>
asking you where, specifically, are the parts that misrepresent you. 
<br>
Please note that if you say, &quot;this is no longer my opinion&quot;, I regard that 
<br>
as a sufficient cause for deletion - it doesn't have to be a 
<br>
misrepresentation on my part.  I'm not going to say, &quot;You said it then, so 
<br>
now it's too late, ha ha.&quot;  People should be allowed to change their minds.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I've forwarded your original post to Chris Rovner and asked him to 
<br>
delete the offending section from the interview.
