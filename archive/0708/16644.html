</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this conversation, running the simulation and not including retribution

<em>&gt; &gt; would be totally pointless.
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>Do you have evidence that they would? In absence of any evidence either way,

what do you think the probability is? 50/50? I doubt it. Everything can be
<br>
assigned a probability regardless of how little we know about it. We may
<br>
have little confidence in our estimates, but we can always always make them.
<br>
<p>That is analogous to assuming that
<br>
<em>&gt; if God exists, he must be a personal God specifically interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the welfare of humans. It's bad enough entertaining the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that God exists / we are in perfect simulation without going further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to speculate about God's / the simulators' motives.
</em><br>
<p><p>There is certainly an obvious analogy between god and an AI running a
<br>
simulation, but this should not be surprising considering there's an analogy
<br>
between an AI and god to begin with.But there are differences as well as
<br>
similarities, and the same arguments used to dismiss god as a creator cannot
<br>
quite be used to dismiss AI as a creator.
<br>
<p>1. Not only do we have no evidence that god exists, we have no evidence that
<br>
a god might exist anywhere, or appear at a later date. The concept simply
<br>
doesn't hold water. Whereas AI is something we expect to exist, and even
<br>
expect to create ourselves.
<br>
<p>2. An AI's goals are to an extent predictable, since they are determined by
<br>
the goals of its programmers and by mistakes they may have made. There's no
<br>
reason to expect a friendly god, but there is a reason to expect a friendly
<br>
AI: people would try to make one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With the knowledge of what is contained within a hermetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulation, the beings within that simulation can legitimately assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different probabilities to different theories of what is outside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are talking about the kind of God or simulation that leaves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence behind, then yes. But the assumption is that it is a perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, which means there is nothing to distinguish it from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, by definition. It is equivalent to assuming that the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was created by a God who, in his omnipotence, made it look as if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no God. What evidence could you possibly have for or against such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God?
</em><br>
<p><p>To give a trivial example, If I was such a god myself, and I was in the
<br>
habit of creating perfect simulated copies of myself, I'd say the
<br>
probability was pretty damn good that I was one of them.
<br>
<p>Your argument basically comes down to the idea that if we're inside a
<br>
mysterious box, we can't predict what's on the outside. Or analogously, that
<br>
if we're on one side of a mysterious wall, we can't predict what's on the
<br>
other side. Or analogously, that if we're outside a mysterious box, we can't
<br>
predict what's on the inside.
<br>
<p>Simply because we can't see in.
<br>
<p>This just isn't true. We can predict what is inside boxes, and we can
<br>
predict what is outside boxes. However hard it is, there is nothing that
<br>
makes it impossible. The situation is not a special case.
