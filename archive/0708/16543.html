</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This question is not correct: you will become each one of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Expectations before the procedure can only prepare you to operate
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can't have general expectations, so in some of the futures you
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>I don't see that it is. In the above scenario, I'd be preparing for the
<br>
mines of mercury, because being handed a big bag of money doesn't really
<br>
require preparation. Seems like an easy enough choice. If 1000 of me were
<br>
getting shipped to the desert and one was getting shipped to mount everest,
<br>
I'd be preparing for the desert because I'd rather there be more of me than
<br>
less of me.
<br>
<p>such as correlation to certain measure of this or that
<br>
<em>&gt; outcome.
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't even know what this means.
<br>
<p>This is a kind of remnant of evolution, which tried to infect
<br>
<em>&gt; as much future branches as possible with given DNA.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm not really sure what this has to do with the topic at hand. Under the
<br>
many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, everything is being split
<br>
into zillions of possibilities constantly.
