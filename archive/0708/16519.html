<p>I spend my days prescribing psychotropics for the mentally ill, and
<br>
there really has been only minimal progress in drug efficacy over the
<br>
last few decades. None of the new antidepressants are any more
<br>
effective than the tricyclics and MAO inhibitors, none of the
<br>
antipsychotics are any more effective than haloperidol (with the
<br>
possible exception of the very toxic drug clozapine), and none of the
<br>
anxiolytics are more effective than diazepam: all drugs which date
<br>
back to at least the 1960's. The only advantage of the newer drugs is
<br>
in side-effect profile, and even there the advantages are probably
<br>
overstated. For example, in a recent multicentre trial of
<br>
antipsychotics the conclusion was that the newer drugs are no better
<br>
than the older ones in neurological side-effects, and significantly
<br>
worse in metabolic side-effects such as weight gain and diabetes. This
<br>
is not to say that there will not be progress in the next few years
<br>
with new drugs targetting different receptors, but the popular
<br>
impression (if such there is) of progress in the last few years is due
<br>
to drug company and media hype.
