<em>&gt; Unfortunately Tim you know as well as I do this is the way the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works. I wish I was wrong. The first space travellers will be the wealthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (ref. air travel), most likely they will also be the first to have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant interaction with future AI (after the scientists who designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them). If &quot;Uploading&quot; were to become feasible in our lifetimes, I doubt I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be anywhere near the foodchain as there would be a queue of billionaires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead of me. It reminds me that in the event of a nuclear war who would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people in the safest environment?  I wonder if &quot;Uploading&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction with a vastly superior intelligence were available today who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be really be interacting/uploading?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Our interactions will be mediated by the market. Think about a factory
<br>
worker in Haiti: he spends twelve hours a day stitching together baseballs,
<br>
even though he may be completely ignorant of the rules of the sport, the
<br>
people who play it, and the cultural and economic institutions necessary for
<br>
Americans to have enough leisure time and disposable income to pay someone
<br>
else to handle such boring chores.
<br>
<p>If there is an AI right now, for all you and I know it's doing credit market
<br>
arbitrage or something, and collectively changing the behavior of millions
<br>
of people by minuscule amounts. If you make it greedy but noncoercive, it's
<br>
probably going to do something like that (and if it's benevolent, it might
<br>
still know that the best way to do good is to sling around billions of
<br>
dollars).
<br>
<p><p>I don't think there's an answer to your last question, but I can think of a
<br>
useful way to rephrase it: Assume there's an AI right now; where is it
<br>
hiding, and who knows it's there?
