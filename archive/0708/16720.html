<p>
<em>&gt; &gt; And even if you're RIGHT, and there is a pandemonium of human infighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulation which cancels out to nothing, there is no reason rolf's plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot be implemented as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It wouldn't do any harm to implement it, but to be consistent an agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should take any threat via simulation from the next level up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously.
</em><br>
<p><p>Your strategy of ignoring the problem may be consistent, but it's hardly
<br>
rational. ╔ou seem to believe that by providing hypothetical (and in my
<br>
opinion quite contrived) scenarios in which simulation traps result in
<br>
unpleasant or confusing situations, you've given adequate grounds for
<br>
plugging your ears and going la-la-la, as though being rational should
<br>
always be easy and simple.
<br>
<p>If there is only one known such threat it is easy to decide
<br>
<em>&gt; what you should do, but the moment it becomes clear that it is a cheap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy to gain advantage everyone will jump on the bandwagon.
</em><br>
<p><p>It is not a cheap strategy to gain advantage, it is a rather elaborate
<br>
strategy to encourage cooperation between entities which otherwise have no
<br>
contact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If both parties run X simulations, your likelihood of being in one of A's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulations rather than B's simulations is proportional to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likelihood of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A existing in the first place rather than B. As X goes to infinity, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likelihood does not change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, but if there are many competing interests rather than just two,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will be difficult to choose between them. You would have to try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess which organisation would be the most determined and the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of running their proposed simulation in the long term.
</em><br>
<p><p>Which according to you is impossible for some hand-wavey reason.
<br>
<p>I think what bothers people about the simulation argument is that it seems
<br>
so akin to religion, or at least to a certain very defensive religious
<br>
position, that god created the world, fossils, etc. all to look exactly as
<br>
though they were created naturally. The argument is consistent, but very
<br>
weak because it fails to provide a motive for god or a reason for his
<br>
existence.
<br>
<p>The simulated karma trap gets to this scenario from the other direction, and
<br>
the reason it's worth bothering about is that it DOES provide a motive and
<br>
it DOES provide a reason for the existence of the creator. Indeed, it is our
<br>
motives and our existence.
<br>
<p>It seems to me you have reasoned by analogy that if something smells like
<br>
religion, it must be unsound, and then attempted to rationalize your
<br>
position by saying the math is so confusing we ought to ignore it.
