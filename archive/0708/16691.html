<em>&gt; I don't think you need the human component at all. If this plan will work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both the FAI and RAI will figure it out on their own, the FAI will run the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations, and the RAI will respond to them.
</em><br>
<p>This sounded utterly wrong to me at first. But, on reflection, I
<br>
shouldn't assume that the AI's would have the same beliefs about
<br>
'causality' that humans typically do. Part of this is, indeed, in the
<br>
same genre as Newcomb's Paradox, but is not identical; for starters,
<br>
the current problem is more well-defined than generic Newcomb.
<br>
<p>Suppose you, Norman, played the Prisoner's Dilemma with Norman*, who
<br>
is your identical twin brother, or your clone who was raised in the
<br>
exact same environment, or a duplicate from a parallel
<br>
mirror-universe. (And as always with the Prisoner's Dilemma, assume
<br>
you care only about your own payoff). Do you Defect or Cooperate? A
<br>
typical human would say &quot;Defect&quot;; call this the Local Causality
<br>
position (unless there's already a name for this.) But maybe there's
<br>
another defensible (i.e. self-consistent and consistent with the rest
<br>
of Decision Theory) philosophical position: a Nonlocal Causality
<br>
position that implies that if these three conditions hold:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* if your decision correlates ~100% with your opponent's, *and*
<br>
&nbsp;* the correlation is &quot;causal&quot; from a prior root cause (you both have
<br>
the same genes and environment, or you both are copies of the the same
<br>
computer program), *and*
<br>
&nbsp;* you don't have a better way of predicting your opponent's decision
<br>
than observing your own decision,
<br>
<p>then you should choose &quot;Cooperate&quot; since, after observing that you
<br>
made the Cooperate decision, your expected payoff goes up.
<br>
<p>(Are there counterexamples? I think even if there are edge-case
<br>
counterexamples, Nonlocal Causality could be tweaked to remain
<br>
consistent.)
<br>
<p>To a human, Nonlocal Causality sounds like magical thinking. After
<br>
all, Norman's decision can't causally make Norman* choose Cooperate!
<br>
But an AI might not be bothered by this, depending on its
<br>
implementation details.
<br>
<p>Anyway: if, like most humans, FAI believes in Local Causality, then
<br>
you need one or more pre-singularity humans to bootstrap the whole
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>But, if FAI believes in Nonlocal Causality, then I agree that *under
<br>
certain narrow conditions* UFAI's model of FAI can talk UFAI into
<br>
cooperating with FAI, even without the cooperation of any
<br>
pre-singularity humans.
<br>
