<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes: if it's a perfectly transparent (perfectly opaque?) simulation,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulators.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Just because you can't test hypotheses doesn't mean you have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. The prior probabilities are different. In the plan outlined in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this conversation, running the simulation and not including retribution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be totally pointless.
</em><br>
<p>And you have evidence that the simulators would not do things that you
<br>
would consider totally pointless? That is analogous to assuming that
<br>
if God exists, he must be a personal God specifically interested in
<br>
the welfare of humans. It's bad enough entertaining the possibility
<br>
that God exists / we are in perfect simulation without going further
<br>
to speculate about God's / the simulators' motives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Each of these possibilities and every other possibility is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perfectly compatible with all available evidence, and there is no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (by definition) of obtaining further evidence to help you decide which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is more likely. It would be like trying to guess God's shoe size in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the absence of any divine revelation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  My guess at god's shoe size is that god doesn't exist. The existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god, and thus of his feet, is NOT perfectly compatible with all available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence. With the knowledge of what is contained within a hermetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, the beings within that simulation can legitimately assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different probabilities to different theories of what is outside.
</em><br>
<p>If you are talking about the kind of God or simulation that leaves
<br>
evidence behind, then yes. But the assumption is that it is a perfect
<br>
simulation, which means there is nothing to distinguish it from
<br>
reality, by definition. It is equivalent to assuming that the world
<br>
was created by a God who, in his omnipotence, made it look as if there
<br>
is no God. What evidence could you possibly have for or against such a
<br>
God?
