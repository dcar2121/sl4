/&quot;second life&quot; for human species. We are using our genes and minds in
<br>
/ways we weren't designed for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; My intuition screams at its loudest, for what it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worth, the following points.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1 - a small but expanding number of extreme thinkers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in all  3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remaining superpowers are contemplating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emergence of completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unorthodox technologies. Russia has shown it thinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most outside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; box, with it's references to He3 mining and nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superpower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ambitions and notions of orbital energy stations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the US, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's nutty thinktanks and New American Century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rhetoric has done its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fair share of wild eyed speculation too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No government-sanctioned or political think tank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speculation that I've seen mentions AGI. PNAC's agenda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a political system, not a new piece of technology.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. However to US scientists the whole idea of squirrels
<br>
planted with microsurveillance devices is so rad. And those
<br>
same ideas may be 3 steps below what is discussed over here,
<br>
or on any &gt;H board, but the CIA is a full 3 steps beyond that
<br>
guy who managed the local quickie market. PNAC does look
<br>
at emerging technologies real hard, especially robotics and
<br>
automated warfare systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2- right now I sincerely believe that no sincere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; powerplayer anywhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inhabiting some consolidated power ivory tower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anywhere in the US or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Russia or China will endanger his credibility and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; career by actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suggesting that pseudo-raelians like Kurzweil
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See <a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0511/12949.html">http://www.sl4.org/archive/0511/12949.html</a> on why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism is not a cult.
</em><br>
<p>I know that and you know that, by try convince my ex of
<br>
that. Many normal people who hear of what &gt;H says or
<br>
contemplates will categoricaly refer us to be medicated.
<br>
It's just to big for them (I say with great smugness).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point - publicly that is. However I am positive the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; filthy cthonian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tentacles of the sith are even present here, on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forum, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shape of junior think tank interns and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assorted imps and minions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of darkness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I were offered a position as a junior intern in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (sane, non-political) think tank, I would take it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does this make me an imp or minion of darkness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3- I am certain superpowers are terrified and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extremely defensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about emerging technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Er... like what? Biowarfare and ICBMs are both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-established technologies, and so far as I know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't even have a well-organized plan in place to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with those. If the US were terrified of AGI, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not have granted SIAI 501(c)3 status.
</em><br>
<p>Superpowers are fragmented, disorganized systems. The
<br>
pentagon still uses 90s greenscreens for fear of hackers.
<br>
So let me repeat my statement and let it sink in:
<br>
&quot;certain superpowers are terrified and extremely defensive
<br>
about emerging technologies&quot;. Did I say anything about
<br>
them not supporting study after new technologies? Try
<br>
talking to an IBM researcher I know to hear about paranoid
<br>
fear of virtual reality changing the playing field. Even small
<br>
bits of technological application can change the existing
<br>
world on a fundamental level and they are afraid of the small
<br>
but fundamental sabots-in-the-wheels-of-status-quo.
<br>
And we can not afford to destablize status quo, with all
<br>
those ICBMs laying around.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and have been building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reserves of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kinds to weather... unknowns... accidents. From
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hidden swiss bank
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accounts overflowing with pentagon money, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consolidated oil fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and salt mines with unprecedented barrel reserves, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; am sure and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have seen clues the superpowers are cautious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Political cautiousness has little to do with AGI; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we did actually develop AGI, none of this stuff would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help anyway.
</em><br>
<p>So what you suppose they do? Think outside the box?
<br>
The pentagon is still fighting in the trenches mostly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for instance the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paranoid race to develop and keep secret the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spinoffs of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Metalstorm technology. Metalstorm has already shaken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; several strategic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ballances, and it's still as simple as staplers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What if some lunatic comes up with cold fusion? What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if some lunatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comes up antigravity - the brass ponders with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; furrowed and sweaty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brow. And that's only linear predictable stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cold fusion and antigravity are both physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible according to currently accepted theory;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are predictable in the sense that you can very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidently predict neither will ever happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Antigravity requires negative energy density, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows for solutions to the Einstein equations (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive</a>) which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permit FTL travel, causality violation, and a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunch of other weird stuff. Cold fusion is impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because you cannot invoke the strong force (which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible for fusion) over ranges long enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow nuclei to be far apart (and thus in low energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states).
</em><br>
<p>D'oh. It was a metaphor! How are researchers at the pentagon
<br>
to know what the hell may emerge in 10-20-50 years time. We
<br>
live in a world where *unthinkable* things may emerge. The
<br>
average semi-well educated corporal doing a presentation on
<br>
&quot;the future&quot; will still use Terminator2 video bits in his instructional
<br>
films, - or Minority Report these days. These people think in
<br>
metaphors of what they know. You know antigravity is soft SF,
<br>
I know that, after a few years Orion's Arm. But everybody keeps
<br>
whining about their flying car, because that is how they see this
<br>
strange land &quot;Ze Future&quot;. The semi-specialists know that in
<br>
&quot;Ze Future&quot; strange things are going to happen. My example of
<br>
Metalstorm is just that; fairly straightforward, easy to make,
<br>
built by a small researcher, affordable - and eminently more lethal
<br>
than the whole generation of existing autocannons. Do you see
<br>
and reverse polarity plasma coils in a metalstorm device?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; same brass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; generally elder men with straightforward linear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intellects, will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trouble seeing the implications of smart, evolving,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; modular robotics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with a portable fabber parts womb. The average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanist gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sparkles in his eyes when I say that, but 99% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pentagon staff will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; look puzzled and try wiki-ing what I just said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 99%? Why not 99.999%? Out of six billion people in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, there are only a few thousand transhumanists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I don't see any reason why transhumanists would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attracted to jobs as Pentagon staff officers.
</em><br>
<p>Let me live X years on US welfare and I would be begging them
<br>
to do faked-out &quot;bluff your way into&quot; seminars at the pentagon -
<br>
using small stolen video clips of &quot;minority report&quot; and
<br>
&quot;terminator2&quot;. As long as I can eat !
<br>
<p>Hell, I bet the pentagon has hired quite a few very moral and
<br>
dirt poor pakistani nuclear scientists just to keep them off the
<br>
streets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then most of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will think I am one of those star trek losers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Convince them however
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that such a think could be a reality before 2025 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they'll get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seriously nervous.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have a very hard time convincing technophiles of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the benefits of the Singularity (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/111-6.pdf">http://www.wholeearthmag.com/ArticleBin/111-6.pdf</a> by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cory Doctorow). How are we going to convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government bureaucrats, even if we wanted two?
</em><br>
<p>Not yet. But in a few years that will change.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 4- My intuition screams, again,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your intuition fails when placed into unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations. See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a long list of all the situations in which your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuition has been experimentally demonstrated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fail.
</em><br>
<p>I am extremely aware of the limits of my 1350 gram
<br>
jelly. But I *did* call a few things happening before they
<br>
happened. I called 9/11 a full half year before it happened,
<br>
including hijacked planes and hitting the WTCs. Ask my
<br>
ex, we talked about at length. So intuition isn't wholly
<br>
crap. It works sometimes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; for what it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worth, that elements in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all major superpowers have by now come to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conclusion that &quot;it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wouldn't be so bad if a major percentage of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; succumbed to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; variant of passive demise&quot;, somewhere in the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 20-50 years. I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sure there will be (a) reports detailing how such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrible thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could happen have existed for decades, (b) studies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repopulate earth with people less inclined to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; homosexual or liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or or potheads or french have been completed, (c)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there may even be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; studies to ehm coalesce such a horrible idea into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ehm a post-reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state. Purely speculative of course, but only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because the heathen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communist slopes have a similar program.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As such one thing is clear: I do not trust people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power. Am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wrong, after having witnessed several genocides as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; casual topics in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the news, just after TV-reportings of Paris Hilton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and blipverts? I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; positive people are scum, as a rule, and once given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a good reason and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a few billion dollars, everyone, even that nice lady
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; street, can sink to the moral equivalent of Dick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cheney.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on why stressful situations can turn people evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, people who believe they have a great deal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral responsibility (due to the tremendous impact of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity on the world) are likely to be much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more resistant to this then your random nice lady,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially if they've studied the subject before.
</em><br>
<p>I know, again, I refer you to my ex to see the face of evil.
<br>
(www.vampix.nl, she isn't on it right now, but this is she:
<br>
www.vampix.nl/morgaine-pic-18) Totally irrelevant, but look
<br>
at her youth and understand how people are driven from
<br>
being &quot;nice&quot; to being &quot;career sadists&quot;. Just a random nice
<br>
lady.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Which leads me to one conclusion worth mentioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; here: people like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Elizer, people who make the same bold techno-erotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statements and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have the same eloquent charisma and credibility,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will, at some satured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; point in the future, receive a visit from men in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dark suits, bearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suitcases with money, blonde pleasure-slaves and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other assorted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; temptations to lure them to all kinds of black ops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think tanks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's ethical system sounds like it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly easy to manipulate; just place him in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation where the optimal path to a Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity coincides with whatever you want him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do. Governments may be bad at technology development,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but they're fairly good at psychological manipulation.
</em><br>
<p>It's familiar ground, that particular science is a well-consolidated
<br>
well tested field.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; They will try and buy the elizers of transhumanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when they start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believing. Once the first stray transhumanist with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fiery eyes  gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his first visit by a present day mefistopheles, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can make a sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumption skynet's evil twin-brother is less than 5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; years away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Dare I say &quot;muhuahua?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We've had a hard time finding people who are skilled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to work on an AGI project, and we've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying for the past seven years; how the heck is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government going to do it?
</em><br>
<p>Money. When they think it's worth it, soon enough. And the
<br>
pentagon made sure it has a lot of serendipity money in reserve
<br>
for a rainy day. Ask Cheney.
