<p>
I'd like to comment briefly on a topic that was touched in the previous
<br>
thread: the relationship between robotics and AI. I'm an AI researcher in a
<br>
robotics lab, so I spend some time thinking about this issue.
<br>
<p>As noted, it's not immediately clear why AI researchers should be interested
<br>
in robotics. If we say that our goal is &quot;human-level intelligence&quot;, we can
<br>
say that this goal involves many subgoals (X1, X2, X3.... XN) where the
<br>
various Xi stand for things like:
<br>
1) Vision
<br>
2) Language
<br>
3) Planning
<br>
4) Mathematics
<br>
5) Morality
<br>
...
<br>
<p>And of course each of these is individually difficult and may involve
<br>
several of its own subsubgoals (or subsubproblems). Now, we would hope that
<br>
achieving one of the subgoals will greatly expedite the discovery of the
<br>
others. For example, many people think that vision and language have some
<br>
similarities: both involve &quot;parsing&quot; of ambiguous data. If that is the case,
<br>
then a smart ordering of the subgoals could significantly speed up the
<br>
realization of the entire set. Unfortunately it is not at all clear how to
<br>
do this.
<br>
<p>The view of those who think robotics is important for AI is that researchers
<br>
should basically follow the same path as evolution in achieving the
<br>
subgoals. That is to say, we should first build machines that can
<br>
pseudo-navigate their surroundings, make basic sensor readings and respond
<br>
to them, etc. Once that is achieved, we can hopefully move on to more
<br>
complex tasks, building up to a human-like machine that can walk around,
<br>
perform basic repetitive chores, etc. Then potentially we can make the leap
<br>
to real human thought and culture.
<br>
<p>This view of how to order the subgoals has been advocated most strongly by
<br>
Rodney Brooks (google scholar for &quot;Intelligence without Reason&quot; and
<br>
&quot;Intelligence without Representation&quot;). The Roomba is a direct descendant of
<br>
this line of thought.
<br>
<p>Now the question is: does anyone have a better way to order the subgoals?
<br>
<p>An alternate rationale for pursuing robotics is that there may be some
<br>
practical applications along the way. I wouldn't mind having a robotic
<br>
chaffeur, for example. Some people might dismiss these quotidian
<br>
applications as insignificant compared to the Singularity, and I would tend
<br>
to agree. Note however that video games are insignificant compared to
<br>
computing, nevertheless video games played an important role in driving the
<br>
development of computers.
