</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rational or moral or whatever, but it's what people would.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It doesn't matter what pre-singularity people want, only what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-singularity entity or entities with the power to do the simulations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants. I find it very difficult to believe that post-singularity big tobacco
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and osama bin laden will even exist in any meaningful sense, let alone stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true to the wildly out of character schemes you suggest they will soon have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And even if you're RIGHT, and there is a pandemonium of human infighting via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation which cancels out to nothing, there is no reason rolf's plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be implemented as well.
</em><br>
<p>It wouldn't do any harm to implement it, but to be consistent an agent
<br>
should take any threat via simulation from the next level up
<br>
seriously. If there is only one known such threat it is easy to decide
<br>
what you should do, but the moment it becomes clear that it is a cheap
<br>
strategy to gain advantage everyone will jump on the bandwagon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you playing the devil's advocate or do you really think it's even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; remotely likely that big tobacco would invest in a karmic simulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; universe in order to get people to smoke?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As you put it, everybody and his brother could join in, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result that the only rational action would be to ignore the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possibility of a simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, your answer is YES?
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Although, the more I think about it, the more it seems that
<br>
someone might actually try this, especially if the simulation argument
<br>
becomes commonly accepted as valid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If both parties run X simulations, your likelihood of being in one of A's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations rather than B's simulations is proportional to the likelihood of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A existing in the first place rather than B. As X goes to infinity, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likelihood does not change.
</em><br>
<p>Right, but if there are many competing interests rather than just two,
<br>
it will be difficult to choose between them. You would have to try to
<br>
guess which organisation would be the most determined and the most
<br>
capable of running their proposed simulation in the long term.
