</em><br>
<p>They might announce it as soon as they hear of Rolf Nelson's idea. In
<br>
fact, every special interest group could make a similar proposal,
<br>
having only to commit to run the simulation when computing resources
<br>
become cheap enough, which eventually they will. You would have to
<br>
give equal credence to all the competing claims about the motives and
<br>
plans of the potential simulators.
