Peter,
<br>
<p>You're right, it does end up sounding like a contradiction :-)
<br>
<p>In order to straighten things out, it's necessary to get into some of
<br>
the technical details...
<br>
<p>When defining intelligence I use the algorithmic complexity of the
<br>
environment.  The environment is an enumerable semi-measure
<br>
and the set of all of these is enumerable.  Thus we can describe
<br>
the environment by giving its index in this enumeration.  Then the
<br>
complexity of the environment is the prefix Kolmogorov complexity
<br>
of this index.  The important point for you is that the environment
<br>
is a kind of &quot;probability distribution&quot; (roughly speaking).  Thus an
<br>
environment that generates bits randomly (by that I mean with a
<br>
uniform distribution, for example by flipping a fair coin) has a low
<br>
complexity because the uniform distribution is a very simple function.
<br>
However, the sequence that it generates (with probability 1) has
<br>
infinitely high Kolmogorov complexity as you can't describe the
<br>
exactly sequence simply.
<br>
<p>In short: A simple process (uniform random distribution) can generate
<br>
a sequence that is very complex (to describe exactly you would have
<br>
to list the bits).
<br>
<p>Now, in the other paper of mine that Matt was talking about I prove
<br>
a bound on the performance of AI systems based on their complexity.
<br>
In short, in order to be able to learn to exactly predict a complex
<br>
sequence that is deterministic (e.g. not a random one, they can't be
<br>
predicted obviously), then the predictor itself has to be quite complex.
<br>
<p>I hope this helps a little..
<br>
<p>Cheers
<br>
Shane
