<em>&gt; Just as the most successful parasites do not kill their hosts, successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worms will remain hidden.  Your computer will seem to work normally.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really, what could you do?  You google for a test and download a patch, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the worm watching your every move?  Wipe your disk and reinstall the OS from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CD, and then connect to an Internet where every computer is infected?  Or do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you just accept that you can't trust your computer, and just live with it?
</em><br>
<p>Computer security issues are a big problem already, without an AGI
<br>
recursively rewriting the attack patterns. I have been working with
<br>
Eugene Kaspersky, a renowned security expert, for the last seven
<br>
years, and he has become lately rather pessimistic in the overall
<br>
capacity of the industry to keep up. If you search in Google his
<br>
latest remarks you will notice that: there are fewer widespread
<br>
attacks, flashworms, and such, and that the self-protection mechanisms
<br>
of the attacks that do spread are getting better.
<br>
<p>The reason for the first is that the recursive evolution is happening
<br>
with human intelligence being involved, and still rapidly enough:
<br>
organized crime is now running the development of the latest attacks,
<br>
and manage the spam operations, and the botnets. These organizations
<br>
are looking for ROI, and not visibility.
<br>
<p>The second's roots are in the better and better application of strong
<br>
cryptographic elements. Once properly implemented, and in a complete
<br>
circle of vector, infection, and communication processes, the white
<br>
hats will be powerless. (Unless some for the moment unsubstantiated
<br>
quantum breakthroughs move the battle to a new ground.)
<br>
<p>The intentions of the entities are malevolent already enough, and not
<br>
friendly at all, as the death of a leading Russian spammer
<br>
illustrates. There is also a second category: the website of the
<br>
Academy of the Chinese armed forces has been hacked, or at least that
<br>
is what was thought at the time. After Kaspersky alerted them that
<br>
they were infecting visiting computers, and nothing happened for 6
<br>
months, the thinking is that the infection was not there with the host
<br>
unawares...
<br>
<p>Now this is not a hard takeoff probably, but for those concerned it is
<br>
already hard enough!
