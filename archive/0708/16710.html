<p><em>&gt; It's an interesting point. Illustrates how 'counting the simulations'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is useless. Say, in universe A there is a simulation of universe B,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in universe B there is a simulation of universe C. How many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations of universe C are there? One can say that C is also simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in universe A, so it doubles 'number of times being simulated' for C.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the contribution of indirection?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say, implementation of simulation of universe B in universe A consists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of two devices which communicate with each other. Within each device,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same pattern content can be simultaneously viewed as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented (and hence simulated) on two levels: say, pattern of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication between processing devices and storage devices and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns within processing devices. So, each half of universe B is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively simulated twice, so whole B is simulated 4 times. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulator consists of N parts, it makes 2^N simulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see solution to this debacle in:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) same level of existence of all possible universes (one can say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated by enumerating turing machine, but it should be unnecessary)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as mathematical abstractions;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) irrelevance of number of simulations/identical universes; effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from subjective POV substructures exist simultaneously in all simulations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that contain them.
</em><br>
<p>All simulations which provide an identical 1st person POV are
<br>
equivalent, and in a significant sense redundant, because it is
<br>
impossible even in principle to know which one you are in. If the
<br>
number of simulations were suddenly increased or decreased, it would
<br>
be impossible for you to know that anything unusual had happened: your
<br>
next subjective moment will be in one and only one simulation, any of
<br>
the simulations will do as that one simulation, so provided there is
<br>
at least one simulation available to choose from you can never know
<br>
what's &quot;really&quot; going on.
<br>
<p>However, if there are two or more competing &quot;next moments&quot; then the
<br>
number of simulations is relevant. If there are X simulations in which
<br>
you are tortured and Y simulations in which you are not tortured in
<br>
the next moment, then you have a X/(X+Y) chance of being tortured.
