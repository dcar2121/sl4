<p>
If we are now seeing the light from 6-10 billion years ago, then how  
<br>
can we be sure the void isn't (still) expanding?  If that particular  
<br>
void has stopped expanding (it seems like a difficult thing to test),  
<br>
then that doesn't bode well for the exponentially expanding  
<br>
intelligence (EEI) theory of intergalactic voids; if star-harvesting  
<br>
was a good idea for a billion years, it probably would continue to be  
<br>
a good idea.  In that case, I guess the gravitational lumpiness  
<br>
theory wins; though some of the voids may still be explained by EEI  
<br>
theory.
<br>
<p>Since complexity friendly planets may be rare in the early universe,  
<br>
EEI theory would predict fewer voids from that period.  I wonder if  
<br>
this is true...
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I know very little about astronomy, so I'm probably  
<br>
wrong about most/all of this and the explanation is much less exotic/ 
<br>
exciting that my imagination.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
