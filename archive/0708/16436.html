<p>
Humanity has shown itself so stubborn, so conceited, and so elitist,
<br>
as a quality of almost genetic proportions, the implications are
<br>
staggering. We scarcely discarded out pleistocene hunter-gatherer
<br>
genes and are already adapting faster than credible to modern
<br>
mass-murder realpolitik. The genes allowing such creative leaps have
<br>
been migrating steadily upwards in the gene-pool, hand in hand with
<br>
all the damn money.
<br>
<p>My intuition screams at its loudest, for what it's worth, the following points.
<br>
<p>1 - a small but expanding number of extreme thinkers in all  3
<br>
remaining superpowers are contemplating the emergence of completely
<br>
unorthodox technologies. Russia has shown it thinks most outside the
<br>
box, with it's references to He3 mining and nanotech superpower
<br>
ambitions and notions of orbital energy stations, but the US, with
<br>
it's nutty thinktanks and New American Century rhetoric has done its
<br>
fair share of wild eyed speculation too.
<br>
<p>2- right now I sincerely believe that no sincere powerplayer anywhere
<br>
inhabiting some consolidated power ivory tower, anywhere in the US or
<br>
Russia or China will endanger his credibility and career by actually
<br>
suggesting that pseudo-raelians like Kurzweil could actually have a
<br>
point - publicly that is. However I am positive the filthy cthonian
<br>
tentacles of the sith are even present here, on this forum, in the
<br>
shape of junior think tank interns and other assorted imps and minions
<br>
of darkness.
<br>
<p>3- I am certain superpowers are terrified and extremely defensive
<br>
about emerging technologies and have been building reserves of all
<br>
kinds to weather... unknowns... accidents. From hidden swiss bank
<br>
accounts overflowing with pentagon money, to consolidated oil fields
<br>
and salt mines with unprecedented barrel reserves, I am sure and I
<br>
have seen clues the superpowers are cautious. Take for instance the
<br>
paranoid race to develop and keep secret the spinoffs of the
<br>
Metalstorm technology. Metalstorm has already shaken several strategic
<br>
ballances, and it's still as simple as staplers.
<br>
<p>What if some lunatic comes up with cold fusion? What if some lunatic
<br>
comes up antigravity - the brass ponders with a furrowed and sweaty
<br>
brow. And that's only linear predictable stuff. The same brass,
<br>
generally elder men with straightforward linear intellects, will have
<br>
trouble seeing the implications of smart, evolving, modular robotics
<br>
with a portable fabber parts womb. The average transhumanist gets
<br>
sparkles in his eyes when I say that, but 99% of pentagon staff will
<br>
look puzzled and try wiki-ing what I just said. And then most of them
<br>
will think I am one of those star trek losers. Convince them however
<br>
that such a think could be a reality before 2025 and they'll get
<br>
seriously nervous.
<br>
<p>4- My intuition screams, again, for what it is worth, that elements in
<br>
all major superpowers have by now come to the conclusion that &quot;it
<br>
wouldn't be so bad if a major percentage of people succumbed to a
<br>
variant of passive demise&quot;, somewhere in the next 20-50 years. I am
<br>
sure there will be (a) reports detailing how such a terrible thing
<br>
could happen have existed for decades, (b) studies on how to
<br>
repopulate earth with people less inclined to be homosexual or liberal
<br>
or or potheads or french have been completed, (c) there may even be
<br>
studies to ehm coalesce such a horrible idea into ehm a post-reality
<br>
state. Purely speculative of course, but only because the heathen
<br>
communist slopes have a similar program.
<br>
<p>As such one thing is clear: I do not trust people in power. Am I
<br>
wrong, after having witnessed several genocides as casual topics in
<br>
the news, just after TV-reportings of Paris Hilton and blipverts? I am
<br>
positive people are scum, as a rule, and once given a good reason and
<br>
a few billion dollars, everyone, even that nice lady across the
<br>
street, can sink to the moral equivalent of Dick Cheney.
<br>
<p>Which leads me to one conclusion worth mentioning here: people like
<br>
Elizer, people who make the same bold techno-erotic statements and
<br>
have the same eloquent charisma and credibility, will, at some satured
<br>
point in the future, receive a visit from men in dark suits, bearing
<br>
suitcases with money, blonde pleasure-slaves and other assorted
<br>
temptations to lure them to all kinds of black ops think tanks.
<br>
<p>They will try and buy the elizers of transhumanism when they start
<br>
believing. Once the first stray transhumanist with fiery eyes  gets
<br>
his first visit by a present day mefistopheles, we can make a sure
<br>
assumption skynet's evil twin-brother is less than 5 years away.
<br>
<p>Dare I say &quot;muhuahua?&quot;
