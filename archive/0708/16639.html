</em><br>
<em>&gt; sharing belief, so it isn't actually, but just a thought).
</em><br>
<p>You are having difficulty understanding that a very small probability
<br>
of a certain kind of proposition being true is in many circumstances
<br>
*enough* to make certain kinds of AI decide not to do anything too
<br>
nasty, if it doesn't cost the AI very much to refrain from the
<br>
nastiness. You seem to intuitively think that only not-extremely-small
<br>
probabilities affect rational decision making, but that is incorrect.
<br>
In some cases small probabilities matter.
<br>
<p>There are no &quot;bogus myths&quot; being created, but trying to manipulate the
<br>
situation so that it becomes a *fact* that of all the philosophically
<br>
possible worlds which are identical from the AIs point of view (and
<br>
include an identical AI), a large enough portion are simulations of
<br>
such a kind that in those worlds the AI would not achieve its goals if
<br>
it got too nasty. (There might be slight inaccuracies in some details
<br>
of this description.)
<br>
<p>Have you read and understood Bostrom's original Simulation Argument?
<br>
You do need to be somewhat familiar with anthropic reasoning to not be
<br>
hopelessly confused on the topic being discussed here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You seem to have difficulty understanding that assigning a non-zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; probability to something is a different thing than &quot;believing&quot; in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Religiosity tends to be about assigning probabilities of 1 to silly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; stuff. Here we are talking about assigning a potentially very small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but still non-zero probability to the fact that one is living in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; simulation, and implications of such a probability assignment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I've asked my religious friends, they usually say they can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure if the Bible for example is true or not. They say it might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small possibility, but it's better be safe than sorry (and being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious doesn't carry much cost in some social groups, it can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even benefit locally). So they assign a low probability too.
</em><br>
<p>Christianity, for example, by definition includes certain dogmas which
<br>
you either accept, or you are not a christian. If a person assigns a
<br>
low probability to them (which means that they think the dogmas are
<br>
probably false), they are not a christian. They may hang out with
<br>
actual christians for social reasons, of course. They may also be
<br>
quite confused about what they actually believe and what not.
<br>
<p>(And if it were just about being safe instead of sorry, how did they
<br>
end up &quot;believing&quot; in the Bible but not the holy books of all the
<br>
other religions?)
