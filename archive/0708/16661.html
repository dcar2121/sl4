I think that there are explanations for the Eridanus Void that don't require a
<br>
superhuman intelligence.  (It is in the constellation Eridanus, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.world-science.net/othernews/070823_void.htm">http://www.world-science.net/othernews/070823_void.htm</a> )
<br>
<p>We observe an expanding universe and extrapolate backwards to the conclusion
<br>
that the universe must have been condensed into a single point at the
<br>
beginning of time.  Never mind that Einstein's general theory of relativity is
<br>
based in part on the assumption that spacetime has no discontinuities.
<br>
<p>If you calculate the radius of a black hole that would be formed by all the
<br>
mass of the universe, 2Gm/c^2, it is (order of magnitude) the size of the
<br>
universe today.  So why did it not collapse billions of years ago when it was
<br>
much denser?
<br>
<p>We observe anomalies in the cosmic background radiation, and postulate
<br>
&quot;inflation&quot;, a faster than light expansion of space right after the Big Bang.
<br>
<p>We observe galaxies not only receding, but accelerating away.  We postulate a
<br>
mysterious &quot;dark energy&quot;, a sort of negative gravity, inconsistent with
<br>
general relativity.
<br>
<p>The way we keep bending the laws of physics to fit the data reminds me of
<br>
early astronomers inventing epicycles to salvage the well established theory
<br>
that the sun and planets revolve around the earth.
<br>
<p>Consider what you would observe if you were falling toward a massive black
<br>
hole.  As you approach a massive body, relativity predicts that your clock
<br>
will speed up.  Since the speed of light is constant in your frame of
<br>
reference, nearby objects will appear to accelerate away in all directions.
<br>
<p>As you approach the black hole, it will at first fill half the sky.  But
<br>
because of gravitational lensing, almost any direction you look will be toward
<br>
the hole.  Any light radiating from objects very near the event horizon will
<br>
also be extremely red-shifted (e.g. from gamma rays to microwaves).
<br>
<p>Black holes are predicted by general relativity, so they cannot violate
<br>
continuity of spacetime.  From your point of view, the event horizon is
<br>
infinitely far away.  You cannot reach it because the closer you get, the
<br>
faster your clock runs and the more it appears to recede.  The popular view is
<br>
that once matter crosses the event horizon, it cannot escape.  But this view
<br>
also violates general relativity's symmetry of time.  If nothing can escape,
<br>
then nothing can enter it either.
<br>
<p>A black hole model of the universe does not require any new physics.  Dark
<br>
energy is just gravity.  There is no discontinuity, no inflation, no
<br>
mysterious expansion of space.  But there is one difference in this model. 
<br>
There should be a small spot in the sky, looking directly away from the black
<br>
hole, where you are not looking toward the event horizon.  Depending on how
<br>
close you are, this spot could be arbitrarily small.  You might never find it.
<br>
<p>But now I think we might have.
