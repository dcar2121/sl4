<p>SP&gt; It makes a difference to the probability calculations. In the simple
<br>
SP&gt; case, if you can be sure that one simulation has been run, you have a
<br>
SP&gt; 1/2 chance of being in that simulation. But if a recursive simulation
<br>
SP&gt; has been run, you have a much higher chance of being in the
<br>
SP&gt; simulation.
<br>
<p>It's an interesting point. Illustrates how 'counting the simulations'
<br>
is useless. Say, in universe A there is a simulation of universe B,
<br>
and in universe B there is a simulation of universe C. How many
<br>
simulations of universe C are there? One can say that C is also simulated
<br>
in universe A, so it doubles 'number of times being simulated' for C.
<br>
What is the contribution of indirection?
<br>
<p>Say, implementation of simulation of universe B in universe A consists
<br>
of two devices which communicate with each other. Within each device,
<br>
the same pattern content can be simultaneously viewed as being
<br>
represented (and hence simulated) on two levels: say, pattern of
<br>
communication between processing devices and storage devices and
<br>
patterns within processing devices. So, each half of universe B is
<br>
effectively simulated twice, so whole B is simulated 4 times. If
<br>
simulator consists of N parts, it makes 2^N simulations.
<br>
<p>I see solution to this debacle in:
<br>
1) same level of existence of all possible universes (one can say,
<br>
simulated by enumerating turing machine, but it should be unnecessary)
<br>
as mathematical abstractions;
<br>
2) irrelevance of number of simulations/identical universes; effectively
<br>
from subjective POV substructures exist simultaneously in all simulations
<br>
that contain them.
