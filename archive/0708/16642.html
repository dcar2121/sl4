<p>NH&gt; That's not true.  Suppose there are 5 possible UFAI designs, and we
<br>
NH&gt; can protect against 1 of them by setting up this simulation.  Then
<br>
NH&gt; there is a 1/5 probability we pick the right UFAI.  If there are 100
<br>
NH&gt; designs, the probability reduces to 1/100.  Common designs are easier
<br>
NH&gt; to protect against.
<br>
<p>It's a bit more complicated, but ultimately this scheme can match a
<br>
real instance of the universe (with UFAI) by any number of exact simulations of
<br>
it without spending too much resources. Problem is that simulation
<br>
includes enormous number of arbitrary parameters, so even given a
<br>
single design, for UFAI to expect the same random stuff there should
<br>
exist a simulation that also simulates those exact same random events
<br>
(such as a sequence generated by background radiation random number
<br>
generator within UFAI's universe). Solution is in multiplicity of MWI
<br>
branches. Universe can be regarded as continuously branching. Within a
<br>
given branch, future states can also be branched, in which case latter
<br>
branches are said to be contained in a former branch.
<br>
<p>Problem can be defined as follows: starting from a given moment, one
<br>
of the branches results in generation of UFAI (this branch includes
<br>
all future branches containing UFAIs), and another branch contains at
<br>
least one branch containing a FAI. Let the number of branches double
<br>
every tau (measure of time). Up to a given moment in time T from
<br>
separation of UFAIs' branch, there are 2^(T/tau)
<br>
universe configurations that may contain an UFAI. If friendly AI starts a
<br>
simulation where random events within the simulation are determined
<br>
by random generators in its own universe, different MWI branches of
<br>
FAI will generate different simulations corresponding to different
<br>
branches of UFAI real universes. Let S*tau be the amount of time
<br>
required in FAI universe to produce a tau of branching within a
<br>
simulated universe. In this case, from the start of simulation,
<br>
by the time t FAI will simulate 2^(t/(S*tau)) configurations, so
<br>
to simulate all possible UFAI configurations up to the time T it will
<br>
need time t=T*S, that is slowdown factor depends only on simulation
<br>
implementation and doesn't suffer from multiplicity of possible
<br>
configurations.
<br>
<p>I wonder, is expected utility weighted over all possible outcomes
<br>
a rational goal to pursue? If system accepts MWI, shouldn't it rank
<br>
hightly a scheme where it gambles and performs suicide if it loses?
<br>
All its future instances will win, and it has no incentive to infect
<br>
as much future branches as possible by its presence, that is to
<br>
survive in all branches (which is an evolutionary bias).
