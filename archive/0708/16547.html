<em>&gt; NN&gt; If 1000 of me were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NN&gt; getting shipped to the desert and one was getting shipped to mount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NN&gt; I'd be preparing for the desert because I'd rather there be more of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NN&gt; less of me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if there's no existential risk? Why is more of you better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less of you?
</em><br>
<p><p>It's better under my own personal system of preferences because I like
<br>
myself and I like people like me. If the 1001 people were copies of my 8th
<br>
grade lab partner, I might prefer that only the 1 survive. What does an
<br>
examination of the roots of our value systems have to do with the simulation
<br>
argument?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This is a kind of remnant of evolution, which tried to infect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; as much future branches as possible with given DNA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NN&gt; I'm not really sure what this has to do with the topic at hand. Under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NN&gt; many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, everything is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; split
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NN&gt; into zillions of possibilities constantly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and agents are prepared to those possibilities to a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree. I was trying to make a point that number of simulators of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind doesn't affect subjective experience. If there is even a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulator with everything-enumerating TM (and I believe even one is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required), estimation of what kind of simulation is likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performed and what is not will not affect experience from subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; POV.
</em><br>
<p><p>It does affect the insider's experience, because not all simulations are
<br>
hermetically sealed. If we are in one which is not, what the interface is
<br>
and what is outside will matter, and they will affect our experience. I'm
<br>
really not sure what you're trying to say.
<br>
<p>Evolution produced a system that is sustained in our universe branch.
<br>
<em>&gt; It is prepared to exist in this branch.
</em><br>
<p><p>If I understood what you were trying to say, I would argue with it.
