<p><em>&gt; SP&gt; All simulations which provide an identical 1st person POV are

</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; impossible even in principle to know which one you are in. If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; number of simulations were suddenly increased or decreased, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; be impossible for you to know that anything unusual had happened: your
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; the simulations will do as that one simulation, so provided there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; at least one simulation available to choose from you can never know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; what's &quot;really&quot; going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What then if ALL the simulations are available at least once, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TM enumerator? Does it mean that ALL other simulators are irrelevant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as for each simulation there is at least one protected identical simulation (with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical past and future) running on TM enumerator?
</em><br>
<p>By TM enumerator I take it you mean a program that enumerates all
<br>
possible programs, like a universal dovetailer. In the sense I have
<br>
described, then yes, all the other simulations are irrelevant.
<br>
However, where there are multiple competing futures (as below) the
<br>
weighting of each one matters. There are theories in which it is
<br>
assumed that the universe is the set of all possible programs (which
<br>
perhaps need only exist as Platonic objects), but I don't know if it
<br>
has been successfully shown that this idea yields the known laws of
<br>
physics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; SP&gt; However, if there are two or more competing &quot;next moments&quot; then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; number of simulations is relevant. If there are X simulations in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; you are tortured and Y simulations in which you are not tortured in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP&gt; the next moment, then you have a X/(X+Y) chance of being tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can't distinguish between worlds where you will be tortured, and you can't distinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the worlds where you won't. You also can't distinguish between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all these worlds together prior to potential torture time point. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you assume subjective POV is located in individual simulations, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't jump to different simulation. All you can do is prepare to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different future possibilities to a different degree, to balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources among possible futures. Will your actions be different if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratio of futures with torture to futures without is 1000:1 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1:1000? In all 1000 simulations of that or another outcome you will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a completely identical entity, thinking the same thoughts about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same events, at the same moments. How is 1000 of identical copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiencing torture worse than 1 copy experiencing torture, if it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same experience?
</em><br>
<p>I dispute the statement that I can't jump to a different simulation.
<br>
If one second ago my simulation in world A was ceased and my
<br>
simulation in world B immediately started up, so that one second ago
<br>
only the A version was running and now only the B version is running,
<br>
I could not possibly know that this had happened. I still find myself
<br>
in one and only one simulation at any one moment, but as I cannot know
<br>
which simulation, my POV can jump around from one to another every
<br>
moment.
<br>
<p>A consequence of this is that if I am being tortured in say 100
<br>
parallel simulations, I will not notice anything different if this
<br>
number is increased to 1000 or decreased to 1: in the former case my
<br>
POV will randomly shift to one of the 1000, in the latter case it will
<br>
definitely shift to just the single simulation, and in both cases I
<br>
will continue experiencing the torture with 100% probability.
<br>
<p>But suppose instead I am given the option of having 900 new
<br>
simulations start up in which I am being tortured and the torture
<br>
suddenly stops, while the simulation continues. At this point, my POV
<br>
will randomly be allocated to either one of the original 100
<br>
simulations where the torture continues or to one of the 900 new
<br>
simulations in which the torture stops, since any one of these 1000
<br>
simulations is equally well qualified to continue my identity. I will
<br>
therefore experience a 9/10 chance of having the torture stop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To the point of my previous message: how do you count simulations?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is your solution to that counting paradox I wrote about in previous message?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does a presence of 2^N simulations within a single implementation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow influence probability of you being in certain simulation?
</em><br>
<p>If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that doubling the
<br>
number of implementations in a recursive simulation will increase the
<br>
total number of entities in that implementation not by a factor of 2,
<br>
but by a factor of 2^N, with N being the number of levels. I don't see
<br>
why this shouldn't also increase the weighting by 2^N for the purpose
<br>
of probability calculations, although this does provide a possible
<br>
experimental method to determine if we are in a recursive simulation.
