<p><em>&gt; How do you know?  All we know is that the universe is consistent with a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computable, then the algorithmically simplest models consistent with past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observations will be the best predictors of future results, regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiment.  This is in agreement with our observation of Occam's Razor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd need to know more about this theory to respond. Do you have a link? My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first question would be: how do you define algorithmic simplicity? It can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be Kolmogorov Complexity, because the simplest algorithm will be the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that discards inputs and returns nil.
</em><br>
<p>Marcus Hutter has some papers on AIXI.
<br>
<a href="http://www.hutter1.net/ai/aixigentle.htm">http://www.hutter1.net/ai/aixigentle.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Hutter models an agent and an environment as a pair of interacting Turing
<br>
machines exchanging bits of information.  In addition, the environment outputs
<br>
a reward signal.  The agent has a goal of maximizing the accumulated reward. 
<br>
Hutter proves that the optimal (although uncomputable) strategy is for the
<br>
agent to guess at each step that the environment is simulated by the shortest
<br>
program consistent with the interaction observed so far.
<br>
<p>The proof of AIXI requires that the environment have a computable probability
<br>
distribution.  Of course this is not a proof that the universe actually has
<br>
such a distribution, but the fact the the result is observed in our reality
<br>
(i.e. Occam's Razor) suggests that it does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a good rephrasing of Nietzsche (or Groundhog Day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://rightreason.ektopos.com/archives/2007/06/nietzsche_and_t_1.html">http://rightreason.ektopos.com/archives/2007/06/nietzsche_and_t_1.html</a> ).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assume you are a post-singularity entity living in a simulation: how does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this affect your behavior? If you'd act differently in that case -- why?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it matters.  From the point of view of the simulator, your
<br>
behavior is deterministic.  You were programmed to guess that the universe
<br>
might be a simulation, and probably to misguess what the real world is like. 
<br>
Our thinking is constrained by our model of the universe.  In the real world,
<br>
concepts such as people, space, time, and mass might be meaningless, just
<br>
mathematical abstractions.
<br>
<p>BTW Groundhog Day was interesting, but differed from Nietzsche in that the
<br>
subject remembered each repeated existence.  From Nietzsche's point of view,
<br>
it is irrelevant, just as it is irrelevant whether there is a past and a
<br>
future, or whether there is only a single point in time right now, and all of
<br>
your memories were created to simulate a past and a belief in a future.
