</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to that one 2D game, you would assume that there were only two

</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe only has sixteen colors.
</em><br>
<p><p>Most 2D games still have the APPEARANCE of a third dimension, and most 3D
<br>
games have action confined to a surface. It's fairly clear in both cases
<br>
that they are made to be played on a 2D screen, and thus by 3D people.
<br>
<p>Our one instance in this &quot;universe&quot; is nowhere near enough to extrapolate
<br>
<em>&gt; accurately to an outside universe.  If this is a simulation, the beings that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created it would be post-singularity level beings.  Due to the nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity, their existence is currently impossible to describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me the very fact that they are &quot;post-singularity level beings&quot;
<br>
is the beginning of a description. If indeed they are, then many more
<br>
predictions might be made, because while a post-singularity entity could be
<br>
and do almost anything, what it WOULD do depends on the original
<br>
optimization target of whoever orchestrated the singularity, and whether
<br>
something went wrong and that target became corrupted.
<br>
<p>In either case, the original target was probably something we would not find
<br>
totally alien, if it was the target of evolved beings, because evolution is
<br>
likely to create beings that are like us in many ways, regardless of the
<br>
environment. Beings that like surviving, eating, and reproducing. Beings
<br>
that are just exactly smart enough to create civilization.
<br>
<p>However, I'm not sure it is certain a simulation would have to be created by
<br>
post-singularity level beings. If the laws of their reality are
<br>
significantly different from our own, they may have been able to create near
<br>
infinite computing power long before they have a singularity, and all you
<br>
need to simulate our universe is gobs of computing power and our laws of
<br>
physics.
<br>
<p>In fact, I think it's plausible that they could simulate a universe
<br>
pre-singularity even if their world is just like ours. Perhaps the hurdle to
<br>
strong AI is bigger than we think, and nanotech gets its day in the sun. I
<br>
could see it being possible only years from now to make a planet into a
<br>
giant computer that was still essentially dumb, and a planet made of
<br>
computronium could probably simulate a reasonable chunk of universe if you
<br>
cheated a bit.
