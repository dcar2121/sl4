<em>&gt; &gt; The problem with those assumptions is that you

</em><br>
<em>&gt; would assume that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe only has sixteen colors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most 2D games still have the APPEARANCE of a third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dimension, and most 3D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; games have action confined to a surface. It's fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear in both cases
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hmmm.. according to the string theorists, space-time
<br>
is ten-dimensional. Therefore, it's meant to be played
<br>
by eleven-dimensional creatures. Maybe there's a cheat
<br>
code hidden somewhere in the sixth dimension?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our one instance in this &quot;universe&quot; is nowhere near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to extrapolate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accurately to an outside universe.  If this is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, the beings that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; created it would be post-singularity level beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Due to the nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; singularity, their existence is currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me the very fact that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;post-singularity level beings&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the beginning of a description.
</em><br>
<p>So is calling something a &quot;thingy&quot;. So is calling
<br>
something an &quot;n-rank tensor in k-dimensional space&quot;.
<br>
Trying to get useful information from the statement
<br>
&quot;post-singularity level beings&quot; is on roughly the same
<br>
order of absurdity as trying to derive general
<br>
relativity from knowing &quot;the curvature of space-time
<br>
is an n-rank tensor&quot; (and nothing else). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If indeed they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are, then many more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions might be made, because while a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-singularity entity could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and do almost anything, what it WOULD do depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimization target of whoever orchestrated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity, and whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something went wrong and that target became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corrupted.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but we don't know the specifics of how any of
<br>
this happened. You might as well try and solve for a
<br>
billion unknowns with one equation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In either case, the original target was probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something we would not find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally alien, if it was the target of evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings, because evolution is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to create beings that are like us in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, regardless of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. Beings that like surviving, eating, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproducing. Beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are just exactly smart enough to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization.
</em><br>
<p>How do we know that these creatures *evolved*? How do
<br>
we know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics operates
<br>
in their universe? How do we know that one plus one
<br>
would equal two?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I'm not sure it is certain a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to be created by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-singularity level beings. If the laws of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly different from our own, they may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been able to create near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite computing power long before they have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity, and all you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to simulate our universe is gobs of computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power and our laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, I think it's plausible that they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulate a universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-singularity even if their world is just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ours. Perhaps the hurdle to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong AI is bigger than we think, and nanotech gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its day in the sun. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could see it being possible only years from now to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a planet into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; giant computer that was still essentially dumb, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a planet made of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computronium could probably simulate a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chunk of universe if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheated a bit.
</em><br>
<p>You can dream up whatever kind of beings you want, so
<br>
long as they have adequate technology, and then cook
<br>
up a plausible-sounding argument for why they would
<br>
simulate us. To shamelessly steal Eliezer's
<br>
terminology, the hypothesis of a &quot;universe simulation&quot;
<br>
does not forbid any outcomes; it does not serve to let
<br>
us anticipate the future. It is a disguised hypothesis
<br>
of complete ignorance.
