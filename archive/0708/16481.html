So let's assume this simulation argument has merits - it should have
<br>
some kind of functionality, right? I mean it wouldn't be just a lava
<br>
lamp, it would grant the superuser some kind of experiential, hand-on
<br>
benefit. Well, as our world is made up of power differences my bet is,
<br>
if such a superuser exists, it would be something with power
<br>
differences. After all we live in an unprecedented time in history,
<br>
just years away from a unique event, with stuff heating up all around
<br>
us. In fact it would be credible the sim started up somewhere 1
<br>
january 2000-ish, looking at the facts, since so many things happened
<br>
after that. We would think we had a life before 2000 but hey, we
<br>
don't. Plus anything that happened before 2000... doesn't it all feel
<br>
kinda sedate?
<br>
<p>The superuser who had all this benefit from the simulation would be
<br>
someone having the best opportunities to push buttons, ie. exert user
<br>
privilege. Call it executive user privilege. But as we all know,
<br>
playing games we tend to muck about a bit, on god-mode, goof around
<br>
and try the parameters a little before getting really into it. Maybe
<br>
even try to run the sim into the ground a little. Borderline
<br>
incompetent.
<br>
<p>Now can we think of someone high up who is sufficiently unaccountable,
<br>
who came into his position of power in a way which feels strikingly at
<br>
odds with the level of power he exerts? Miraculous even? Someone who
<br>
doesn't seem to take his job all that serious and acts kinda
<br>
callously, bordering on total disregard for anyone around, as if they
<br>
are all meat puppets? Someone who has a uniquely central role in the
<br>
sim and can do pretty much as he pleases ?
<br>
<p>Hmmm... are there any such decider slash commander guys around?
<br>
Someone who became real prominent just after booting this sim with a
<br>
timecode &gt;2000?
