<em>&gt;From a review I wrote about Damien and Barbara's book.
</em><br>
If you haven't already, check it out at
<br>

<br>
<p><p>This is the best science fiction novel I've read
<br>
in several years.  Broderick and Lamar manage
<br>
to pack a lot of excitement into an intriguing story,
<br>
with a strong transhumanist theme running throughout. 
<br>
<p>As you know, by far the most difficult challenge
<br>
in modern science fiction is to tackle the 'Vingean
<br>
quest', posed by Campbell when he told Vinge &quot;you
<br>
can't write this story, and neither can anyone else&quot;, 
<br>
refering to the profound and ultimately insuperable
<br>
difficulty of depicting the behavior and thinking
<br>
of sentients who're far beyond the range of normal
<br>
human intelligence. This novel presents a realistic
<br>
scenario---though naturally time-compressed---of
<br>
developments as they might actually unfold in
<br>
coming decades, with an emphasis on how it will
<br>
feel to become vastly more intelligent, and to
<br>
experience many of the little things that one
<br>
would notice on the way.
<br>
<p>I especially liked the pacing of the book and the
<br>
clarity of presentation; nothing for me detracts
<br>
more than superfluous ambiguity meant to provide
<br>
obscure puzzles for the reader to solve, and
<br>
thankfully there just a bare necessary minumum
<br>
here. The entire narrative slides smoothly from
<br>
the here-and-now further and further into the purest
<br>
SF, in which the reader's imagination is exercised by
<br>
the tension between what is unlikely and what
<br>
just-might-be-possible. On an emotional level,
<br>
the book delivers, always holding before the reader
<br>
the prospect of light vanquishing darkness, with
<br>
well-drawn, sympathetic, personable, and
<br>
straightforward characters who don't get in
<br>
the way of the story.
