<p>
Giving a Rouge AI the incentive not to eat the earth seems quite plausable,
<br>
since the earth is basically a worthless speck. Giving it the incentive to
<br>
let us have another, friendly singularity seems much more dubious, but it
<br>
still might work if the RAI had a goal that wasn't too big.
<br>
<p>If its task was calculating C to 400 decimal places like you said, it might
<br>
do it in a week and a half, take a bow, and quietly shut down.
<br>
<p>If its task was calculating C to 4000000 zillion decimal places, it might
<br>
decide the probability that a FAI was wasting enough energy to simulate it
<br>
was outweighed by the probability that it needs to be the big man on campus
<br>
in order to get the job done, and as a consequence humanity gets locked in
<br>
an obscure filing cabinet, allowed to have their own toy singularities as
<br>
long as they fit in the space between hullabaloo and humidifier, and
<br>
essentially forgotten until the RAI is done with its work, which may never
<br>
happen.
<br>
<p>At this point humanity is released, along with the billions of smaller AIs
<br>
the RAI picked up in the eons it was expanding and spared for the same
<br>
reason it spared humanity. The simulated karma trap can be directed at
<br>
anyone, not just things you might accidentally create.
