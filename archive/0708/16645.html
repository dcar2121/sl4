<p><em>&gt; &gt; And you have evidence that the simulators would not do things that you

<em>&gt; &gt; would consider totally pointless?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have evidence that they would? In absence of any evidence either way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what do you think the probability is? 50/50? I doubt it. Everything can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assigned a probability regardless of how little we know about it. We may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have little confidence in our estimates, but we can always always make them.
</em><br>
<p>There are some things you have zero chance of guessing, like a
<br>
particular member of the set of all integers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That is analogous to assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if God exists, he must be a personal God specifically interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the welfare of humans. It's bad enough entertaining the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that God exists / we are in perfect simulation without going further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to speculate about God's / the simulators' motives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is certainly an obvious analogy between god and an AI running a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, but this should not be surprising considering there's an analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between an AI and god to begin with.But there are differences as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarities, and the same arguments used to dismiss god as a creator cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite be used to dismiss AI as a creator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Not only do we have no evidence that god exists, we have no evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a god might exist anywhere, or appear at a later date. The concept simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't hold water. Whereas AI is something we expect to exist, and even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to create ourselves.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but that just replaces the concept of God with the super-AI:
<br>
something like Tipler's Omega Point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. An AI's goals are to an extent predictable, since they are determined by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goals of its programmers and by mistakes they may have made. There's no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to expect a friendly god, but there is a reason to expect a friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI: people would try to make one.
</em><br>
<p>If you discount the argument from intelligent design for a real world,
<br>
why would you use it for a simulated world? That is, why assume that
<br>
we are in a simulation designed to produce beings in the simulators'
<br>
image rather than the accidental result of a program trying various
<br>
starting parameters that may or may not give rise to a universe?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; With the knowledge of what is contained within a hermetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; simulation, the beings within that simulation can legitimately assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; different probabilities to different theories of what is outside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you are talking about the kind of God or simulation that leaves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evidence behind, then yes. But the assumption is that it is a perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulation, which means there is nothing to distinguish it from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reality, by definition. It is equivalent to assuming that the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was created by a God who, in his omnipotence, made it look as if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is no God. What evidence could you possibly have for or against such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; God?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To give a trivial example, If I was such a god myself, and I was in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habit of creating perfect simulated copies of myself, I'd say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability was pretty damn good that I was one of them.
</em><br>
<p>And would the probability that you were one of them suddenly drop if
<br>
you decided to stop creating the simulations?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your argument basically comes down to the idea that if we're inside a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysterious box, we can't predict what's on the outside. Or analogously, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we're on one side of a mysterious wall, we can't predict what's on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other side. Or analogously, that if we're outside a mysterious box, we can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict what's on the inside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simply because we can't see in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This just isn't true. We can predict what is inside boxes, and we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict what is outside boxes. However hard it is, there is nothing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes it impossible. The situation is not a special case.
</em><br>
<p>You can make some guess in the case of the box from its size, shape,
<br>
history etc. You can't predict what is inside a box drawn at random
<br>
from the set of all possible boxes.
