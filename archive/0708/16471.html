<p>
The Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence is thrilled to invite
<br>
you to the Singularity Summit 2007, to be held Saturday and Sunday,
<br>
September 8th and 9th, at the beautiful Palace of Fine Arts in San
<br>
Francisco, California. The theme is &quot;Artificial Intelligence and the Future
<br>
of Humanity.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.intelligence.org/summit2007/">http://www.intelligence.org/summit2007/</a>
<br>
<p>We've organized the Summit to be low cost (only $50) to bring in a large
<br>
number of attendees to raise awareness and understanding of an important
<br>
21st century issue. Normally this kind of event would cost hundreds of
<br>
dollars to attend.
<br>
<p>A ticket can be purchased online at the Summit website, which includes your
<br>
reserved seating for both days, two lunches, and the Saturday night
<br>
reception.
<br>
<p>We hope you will join us!
<br>
<p>-Tyler

Singularity Summit to address promise and peril of advanced AI to future of
humanity
What are the major challenges to achieving advanced AI? What are the
benefits and dangers? How far are we from self-improving AI? How should we
prepare for this potentially powerful innovation?
These are among the questions that 17 outstanding thinkers will explore and
debate at the Singularity Summit, to be held Saturday and Sunday, September
8-9, at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, California. The summit is
organized by the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, a
501(c)(3) not-for-profit institute in Silicon Valley for the study of safe
advanced AI.
&quot;Advanced AI has the potential to impact every aspect of human life. We are
in a crucial window of opportunity where we have temporary but powerful
leverage to influence the outcome,&quot; said Tyler Emerson, chair of the summit
and executive director of the Singularity Institute for Artificial
Intelligence. &quot;Only a small group of scientists are aware of the central
issues. It is essential to expand discussion of this critical 21st century
issue, which is why I have created the summit.&quot;
Tickets can be purchased online for $50 at
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/summit2007/tickets/">http://www.intelligence.org/summit2007/tickets/</a>.
Peter Thiel, PayPal Cofounder, Clarium Capital President, and Facebook's
initial investor, will MC the summit and present his new ideas on financial
markets and the Singularity. &quot;It's clear that the term 'AI' means a lot of
different things,&quot; said Thiel. &quot;It's one of these terms that has been
bandied about a great deal, and has been misused a lot. It has been
predicted for a long time that AI is right around the corner, and it's
taking longer than many people thought it would, with many disappointments
along the way. However, it's clear that there's a massive set of issues
happening, and people who don't think there's something important going on
are living in a fantasy, and need to wake up.&quot;
Confirmed Summit speakers include:
* Dr. Rodney Brooks, famous MIT roboticist and founder of iRobot
* Dr. Peter Norvig, director of research at Google
* Paul Saffo, Stanford, leading technology forecaster
* Sam Adams, distinguished engineer within IBM's Research Division
* Jamais Cascio, cofounder of World Changing and creator of Open the Future
* Dr. Ben Goertzel, director of research at SIAI and founder of Novamente
* Dr. J. Storrs Hall, author of Beyond AI: Creating the Conscience of the
Machine
* Dr. Charles L. Harper, Jr., senior VP at John Templeton Foundation
* Dr. James Hughes, executive director of Institute for Ethics and Emerging
Technologies
* Neil Jacobstein, prominent AI expert and CEO of Teknowledge
* Dr. Stephen Omohundro, founder of Self-Aware Systems
* Dr. Barney Pell, founder and CEO of Powerset
* Christine Peterson, cofounder of Foresight Nanotech Institute
* Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal and founder of Clarium Capital
* Wendell Wallach, author of Machine Morality: From Aristotle to Asimov and
Beyond
* Eliezer Yudkowsky, Friendly AI pioneer and cofounder of SIAI
* Peter Voss, founder and CEO of Adaptive Artificial Intelligence
&quot;To any thoughtful person, the Singularity idea, even if it seems wild,
raises a gigantic, swirling cloud of profound and vital questions about
humanity and the powerful technologies it is producing,&quot; said Douglas R.
Hofstadter at last year's Singularity Summit at Stanford, author of Gödel,
Escher, Bach, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1980. &quot;Given this mysterious and
rapidly approaching cloud, there can be no doubt that the time has come for
the scientific and technological community to seriously try to figure out
what is on humanity's collective horizon. Not to do so would be hugely
irresponsible.&quot;
About the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI):
SIAI is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institute in Palo Alto, California, with
three long-term goals: furthering the nascent science of safe advanced AI
(self-improving cognitive systems) through research and development,
research fellowships, research grants, and science education; furthering the
understanding of its implications to society through educational outreach,
such as the annual Singularity Summit; and furthering education among
students to foster an interdisciplinary field for the study of safe advanced
AI. Learn more by visiting SIAI at <a href="http://www.intelligence.org">http://www.intelligence.org</a>.
