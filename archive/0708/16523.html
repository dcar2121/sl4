<em>&gt; It very much depends on the country.  The Netherlands has about as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many muslims as the US as a percentage of the population.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries like France, it is quite a bit more than the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, in the US the Islamic community is not prone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts religious murder (see: Theo Van Gogh in the Netherlands) nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious riots and violence (see:  newspaper editorial cartoon in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Denmark) nor prone to large-scale fermentation of Islamic malcontents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (see: France).  Hell, even the 9/11 disaster required importing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamic malcontents from the far side of the Atlantic.  All the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really has that is similar is fringe Christians, and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals are rarely prone to newsworthy violence in practice.
</em><br>
<p>Ludicrous. One very vocal commentator gets killed in several years. In the
<br>
same years about twenty times as many people are killed my lightning
<br>
strikes. This is a complete non-issue, despite the detail I wrote with Theo
<br>
before his death. In the same five years the number of people shot in
<br>
maffia style executions in the netherlands alone is probably more than
<br>
100, including innocent bystanders. Yet where is the media concern
<br>
about that?
<br>
<p>Might be the same old panic mongering or xenophobia.
<br>

<br>
<p>And regarding those fringe Christians, those types are known widely for
<br>
assassinations in and bombings of abortion clinics. Sometimes they even
<br>
make mistakes and bomb clinics with no abortion in sight, and afterwards
<br>
they say oops in court. However those are not regarded as terrorists,
<br>
despite in some cases loudly calling for another 911, to &quot;make people
<br>
come to their senses&quot;, or &quot;to bring closer armageddon&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What does robotics have to do with the Singularity?  Nothing that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can see.  The Singularity will almost certainly start in the US, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the simple basis that it has an immense, established, and relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient infrastructure for doing this kind of research and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development that no other entity can currently compete with.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter of simple odds.
</em><br>
<p>The singularity is based on robotics. Robotics in Japan is based on providing
<br>
care for the elderly, or as replacement/assistive construction workers.
<br>
Last time I checked robotics required AI and AI was well, the prime
<br>
requirement for a singularity occurring. I see a lot of articles on productive
<br>
robotics/AI research.
<br>
<p>*sighs heavily*
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; America is losing the edge and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chances are we will see a USSR-style collapse in the US a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sooner than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most people anticipate. Maybe within 10 years.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; While the US may be losing its advantage in certain relative terms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it still has an *enormous* advantage in practice.  It is still the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-tech entrepreneurial capital of the human universe for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseeable future.  By the time this changes in a significant way, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would expect that we are way past the Sell By date on the Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idea that the US will undergo a &quot;USSR-style collapse&quot; within 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years is so out of touch with reality that it almost does not even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve comment.    I think some trends in the US are bad, but even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it is more a case of the US doing its level best to match some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the existing poorer qualities of European governance.
</em><br>
<p>So, who *is* The US comptroller general David Walker?
<br>
Probably a nobody. Or a democrat.

<p>Tell me, do you watch Fox?
