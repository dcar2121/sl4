<em>&gt; &gt;     How can we assign probabilities to extrapolations when we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     idea what proportion of the complete set of imaginable things we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     can imagine?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This objection applies to every assignment of probability, not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ones related to looking outside the box. I'm not sure what the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability answer is, if there is one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to every assignment of probability, just to the ones where we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomplete information - for example, I know that the dice is fair, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know Newtonian physics, so I can be reasonably certain that the chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of rolling a particular number are about 1 in 6.
</em><br>
<p><p>I can imagine only three things that would limit what we can imagine. First,
<br>
and most obvious, things which are simply too complicated. In this case we
<br>
should still be able to imagine them in rough outline. Second, things which
<br>
are impossible in the fundamental logic of our universe, like 2 + 2 = 5. We
<br>
can certainly imagine the representation of this, but we can't imagine it
<br>
actually being true, because it's incoherent.
<br>
<p>Third, perhaps we have a specific mental block that prevents us from
<br>
thinking about certain things, which is so sophisticated that it defeats all
<br>
attempts to circumnavigate it, and includes its own existence in the set of
<br>
things it prevents us from seeing. This is certainly physically possible,
<br>
but would seem to require the tampering of some very powerful entity.
<br>
<p>If we take the hypothesis that the universe is built on an infinite regress,
<br>
and from it the theory that there are, in the infinite embeddings, an
<br>
infinite set which are deliberate simulations, then it would seem at first
<br>
glance that:
<br>
<p>A. This sort of tampering must be cast down through the layers an infinite
<br>
number of times, and thus
<br>
B. All thought, or at least all extraneous higher thought that does not
<br>
affect our survival, must be corrupted to the point of being entirely
<br>
incoherent.
<br>
C. Therefore, this argument itself is corrupted to the point of being
<br>
entirely incoherent.
<br>
D.
<br>
Therefore...............th................t.......................................
<br>
<p>But of course, this is wrong, because as well as simulating a universe in
<br>
which all thought, even by entities in sub-simulations and sub-sub
<br>
simulations is corrupted, one could also simulate a universe in which all
<br>
thought was PROTECTED from such corruption, or at least further corruptions.
<br>
The interactions of infinite kinds of layered tampering and prevention of
<br>
tampering are difficult to calculate, to say the least...
<br>
<p>Of course, perhaps there is a simple solution which we are prevented from
<br>
imagining, no?
<br>
<p>My point is, this problem DOES apply to everything, even the rolling of
<br>
dice, because your logic could always be tampered with, and your perception
<br>
of the likelihood that your logic was tampered with could always be tampered
<br>
with as well. The unthinkable is a crack in rationality which has an unknown
<br>
size. It might be a hairline, it might be a chasm.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am confident that if anyone actually penetrates our facades, even the
<br>
most perceptive would still be fundamentally unprepared for the truth of
<br>
House Dimir.&quot;
<br>
- Szadek
<br>
<p>To me, the incompleteness of the information available about our own
<br>
<em>&gt; universe is the crux of the problem: we simply don't know enough to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for certain whether we are living in a simulation, much less to make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guesses about the nature of the universe which may or may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulating us. Needless to say it would be very interesting to find out.
</em><br>
<p><p>The only thing that makes me think we're in a simulation is the
<br>
philosophical problem of &quot;why&quot;. Simulation doesn't solve this, but it is a
<br>
probable step in any infinite chain of cause and effect. From all
<br>
appearances, our intelligence was born of evolution, and earthly life was
<br>
born of emergent structures, and a universe with only emergent-level order
<br>
certainly does not require a designer.
