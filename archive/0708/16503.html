The problem with those assumptions is that you only have access to one game.
<br>
&nbsp;There are still plenty of 2D games available.  If you only have access to
<br>
that one 2D game, you would assume that there were only two dimensions and
<br>
time.  This ignores that there may be many more that we can't yet perceive.
<br>
&nbsp;Looking back fifteen years, you would assume that the universe only has
<br>
sixteen colors.
<br>
Our one instance in this &quot;universe&quot; is nowhere near enough to extrapolate
<br>
accurately to an outside universe.  If this is a simulation, the beings that
<br>
created it would be post-singularity level beings.  Due to the nature of the
<br>
singularity, their existence is currently impossible to describe.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From examining one video game, one might easily guess that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The universe has three major spatial dimensions, and one time dimension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gravity exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a civilization of intelligent creatures which have two legs, two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arms, two eyes, and one mouth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They wear clothes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They speak english
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have reasonably complex technology, such as guns, airplanes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elevators, electric lights, plumbing, and the ability to create large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buildings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They enjoy video games
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems not-insignificant to me. Of course, one could reasonably object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if reality is a simulation, it is unlikely to be a game, and even if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, alien games may be much more or less like the worlds of their creators.
