The prior probabilities are different. In the plan outlined in this

totally pointless.

<p>Each of these possibilities and every other possibility is
<br>

</em><br>
<p><p>My guess at god's shoe size is that god doesn't exist. The existence of god,
<br>
and thus of his feet, is NOT perfectly compatible with all available
<br>
evidence. With the knowledge of what is contained within a hermetic
<br>
simulation, the beings within that simulation can legitimately assign
<br>
different probabilities to different theories of what is outside.
