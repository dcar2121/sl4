<p>
Not sure I agree with everyone calling this &quot;simulation&quot;, it's more a
<br>
&quot;brain in a vat&quot; scenario. I guess I'll go along with it, as long as
<br>
everyone keeps straight that in the current proposals, it's the
<br>
*environment* that's being simulated, not the AI itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose you are the UFAI. You suspect you are in the karma simulator, and you are thinking about how likely it is. It stands to reason that the more 'common' a UFAI design is, the more likely it is to be tested by being put in a karma simulator, and so the more common a design you find yourself to be, the more likely you are to be in a karma simulator. Obviously, if your design is very unusual and odd and haphazard, then it'd be easier to conclude that you are not in the karma simulator - who on earth would want to engage in expensive testing of weird and unlikely designs?
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree. The reduction in probability that &quot;someone would bother
<br>
to simulate such an odd design&quot; is offset by the reduced probability
<br>
that &quot;someone would bother to create such an odd design in the
<br>
unsimulated world.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose there are other things you could do to increase your confidence that you aren't in a simulation, like attempt to use up absurd amounts of resources and force computation on the part of the simulation, or detect inaccuracies and approximations
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>These are important tactical considerations that aren't addressed by
<br>
the 'proof-of-concept' proposal. The second proposal, on the other
<br>
hand, was to let the FAI work out the 'line of attack' by producing
<br>
the text of the promise P that you 'should have made' in 2007. (You
<br>
still have to credibly and publicly commit to P in 2007, though, even
<br>
though you don't know yet what the text of P will be!)
<br>
<p>Presumably in 2050 when you discover what P is, it will contain text
<br>
like &quot;if RAI* tries to 'shake the walls' too much to figure out
<br>
whether it's in a simulated environment, we will immediately punish
<br>
RAI* by permanently shutting it down&quot;.
