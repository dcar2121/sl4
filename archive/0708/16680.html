</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I very much doubt that they WILL announce it, as soon as they hear of rolf's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea or at any point afterward. If you believe in god anyway, the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replacing divine judgment with a machine is blasphemous and accomplishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing. In any case, I imagine most people would get to about &quot;ESSAY: How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to deter a rogue AI by&quot; before they stopped reading.
</em><br>
<p>I guess it's also blasphemous for an organisation to rakes in billions
<br>
from the gullible faithful  despite what it says in the Bible about
<br>
camels, wealth and the eye of a needle...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In fact, every special interest group could make a similar proposal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But they won't, and no one would take them seriously if they did.
</em><br>
<p>Why not? Arguably there is more motivation to implement a plan that
<br>
gains you something today than one that might guarantee your
<br>
descendants' future. That's why it's so difficult to deter people from
<br>
burning up fossil fuels and polluting the environment, even if they do
<br>
believe that it is ultimately a bad thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; having only to commit to run the simulation when computing resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; become cheap enough, which eventually they will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully by that point the computing resources will be regulated such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this sort of tomfoolery is not allowed. By the friendly post-singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The differences between your hypothetical situation and rolf's plan are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A. First mover advantage. When the RAI appears, the battle for the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has already been won, either by the RAI or by whatever is simulating it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here in 2007, we're still FIGHTING the battle. All your situation really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consists of is some fatuous imps saying WOULDN'T YOU RATHER BE ON THE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WINNING SIDE?
</em><br>
<p>We might not still be fighting the battle, because we might be in a
<br>
simulation run by the God-schmucks (or whoever). You can't tell it's a
<br>
simulation, that's the point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; B. Two-way interaction. In rolf's plan, the simulated and nonsimulated RAIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in separate branches and thus the real RAI has no way to stop itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from being simulated.* In your thing, we can go to the house of whoever says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; JOIN ME OR DIE and punch them in the face.
</em><br>
<p>You can do that, but if it turns out that you're in the simulation
<br>
you'll be sent to hell for your trouble.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; C. Goal conflict. Under your system, by cooperating we help doom a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant fraction of humanity to hell, which for many people would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarded as Bad Thing. Under rolf's plan, all the AI loses by cooperating is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the raw material humanity is composed of, which it barely cares about one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way or the other.
</em><br>
<p>By cooperating and trying to spread the good word you maximise the
<br>
chances that you and everyone else will go to heaven, at minimal cost
<br>
- sort of like Pascal's wager. Of course, the problem with Pascal's
<br>
wager is that there are so many actual and possible religions that you
<br>
may as well ignore all of them, unless you find good evidence that a
<br>
particular one is true - which translates to evidence that you are in
<br>
fact in a simulation.
