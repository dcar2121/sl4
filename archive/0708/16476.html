I was postulating for the future :D Who would be the first people to
<br>
Upload/Interact? However I do like you've rephrased it. Not getting into
<br>
definitions of AI's/Neural Networks and Expert Systems...
<br>
<p>The Darpa Challenge are using a form of AI to navigate across the
<br>
desert.  No doubt there are systems in place which predict market
<br>
fluctuations, FRU's etc but, in answer to your question.
<br>
<p>If I were an &quot;aware&quot;, independent, AI right now I'd be hiding and observing
<br>
humanity to determine what's happening globally. I would then analyze the
<br>
massive amount of data available to better ascertain what I am dealing with
<br>
(humans) and then decide whether to interact with humanity.
<br>
<p>It would also conclude that reality TV Shows are a subliminal form of
<br>
torture and decide that everyone on this list should win the lottery,
<br>
simultaneously.

<em>&gt;  Unfortunately Tim you know as well as I do this is the way the world

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant interaction with future AI (after the scientists who designed

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ahead of me. It reminds me that in the event of a nuclear war who would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the people in the safest environment?  I wonder if &quot;Uploading&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interaction with a vastly superior intelligence were available today who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be really be interacting/uploading?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Our interactions will be mediated by the market. Think about a factory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worker in Haiti: he spends twelve hours a day stitching together baseballs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though he may be completely ignorant of the rules of the sport, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who play it, and the cultural and economic institutions necessary for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans to have enough leisure time and disposable income to pay someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else to handle such boring chores.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is an AI right now, for all you and I know it's doing credit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market arbitrage or something, and collectively changing the behavior of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of people by minuscule amounts. If you make it greedy but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noncoercive, it's probably going to do something like that (and if it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benevolent, it might still know that the best way to do good is to sling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around billions of dollars).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think there's an answer to your last question, but I can think of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful way to rephrase it: Assume there's an AI right now; where is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiding, and who knows it's there?
