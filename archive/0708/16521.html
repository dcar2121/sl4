<p><p>It very much depends on the country.  The Netherlands has about as

many muslims as the US as a percentage of the population.  For  
<br>
countries like France, it is quite a bit more than the US.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, in the US the Islamic community is not prone to  
<br>
acts religious murder (see: Theo Van Gogh in the Netherlands) nor  
<br>
religious riots and violence (see:  newspaper editorial cartoon in  
<br>
Denmark) nor prone to large-scale fermentation of Islamic malcontents  
<br>
(see: France).  Hell, even the 9/11 disaster required importing  
<br>
Islamic malcontents from the far side of the Atlantic.  All the US  
<br>
really has that is similar is fringe Christians, and those  
<br>
individuals are rarely prone to newsworthy violence in practice.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Second point - I believe the fundaments for a singularity are being

</em><br>
<p><p>What does robotics have to do with the Singularity?  Nothing that I  
<br>
can see.  The Singularity will almost certainly start in the US, on  
<br>
the simple basis that it has an immense, established, and relatively  
<br>
efficient infrastructure for doing this kind of research and  
<br>
development that no other entity can currently compete with.  This is  
<br>
a matter of simple odds.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; America is losing the edge and
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><p>While the US may be losing its advantage in certain relative terms,  
<br>
it still has an *enormous* advantage in practice.  It is still the  
<br>
high-tech entrepreneurial capital of the human universe for the  
<br>
foreseeable future.  By the time this changes in a significant way, I  
<br>
would expect that we are way past the Sell By date on the Singularity.
<br>
<p>The idea that the US will undergo a &quot;USSR-style collapse&quot; within 10  
<br>
years is so out of touch with reality that it almost does not even  
<br>
deserve comment.    I think some trends in the US are bad, but even  
<br>
then it is more a case of the US doing its level best to match some  
<br>
of the existing poorer qualities of European governance.
