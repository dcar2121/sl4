<em>&gt; It is feeding your sensory inputs with data simulating the universe you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.  You don't know it is there because it has total control over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts.  Does anyone else know?  The question assumes that other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm reduced to the &quot;So what?&quot; defense. If I can't interact with the entity,
<br>
and can't test a theory of the entity's existence, it's as real as Zeus.
<br>
<p>How do you know?  All we know is that the universe is consistent with a
<br>
<em>&gt; simulation.  For example, AIXI theory predicts that if the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computable, then the algorithmically simplest models consistent with past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observations will be the best predictors of future results, regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment.  This is in agreement with our observation of Occam's Razor.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'd need to know more about this theory to respond. Do you have a link? My
<br>
first question would be: how do you define algorithmic simplicity? It can't
<br>
be Kolmogorov Complexity, because the simplest algorithm will be the one
<br>
that discards inputs and returns nil.
<br>
<p><p>Suppose we create superhuman intelligence and upload?  What would you want
<br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do?  You could live in any simulated universe you wanted, limited only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its computing power.  What would your universe be like?  Would you choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember that the singularity has already happened, or would you choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearance of realism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a good rephrasing of Nietzsche (or Groundhog Day
<br>
<a href="http://rightreason.ektopos.com/archives/2007/06/nietzsche_and_t_1.html">http://rightreason.ektopos.com/archives/2007/06/nietzsche_and_t_1.html</a> ).
<br>
Assume you are a post-singularity entity living in a simulation: how does
<br>
this affect your behavior? If you'd act differently in that case -- why?
<br>
<p>If I'm an upload-created sim, I'm here is a bit player, because I spend far
<br>
too much time doing relatively boring stuff. If the upload is running at
<br>
faster than real time, this amounts to saying that, after the Singularity,
<br>
some entity will spend a subjective millennium watching me clip my toenails.
