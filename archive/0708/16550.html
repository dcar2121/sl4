<em>&gt;     Not to every assignment of probability, just to the ones where we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     incomplete information - for example, I know that the dice is fair, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     know Newtonian physics, so I can be reasonably certain that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of rolling a particular number are about 1 in 6.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can imagine only three things that would limit what we can imagine. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, and most obvious, things which are simply too complicated. In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this case we should still be able to imagine them in rough outline. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, things which are impossible in the fundamental logic of our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, like 2 + 2 = 5. We can certainly imagine the representation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this, but we can't imagine it actually being true, because it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoherent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third, perhaps we have a specific mental block that prevents us from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about certain things, which is so sophisticated that it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defeats all attempts to circumnavigate it, and includes its own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence in the set of things it prevents us from seeing. This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly physically possible, but would seem to require the tampering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some very powerful entity.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, perhaps I need to clarify.  I'm not talking about the capacity of 
<br>
the human brain to imagine the characteristics of a containing universe, 
<br>
I'm talking about the paucity of information available about a 
<br>
containing universe. If we are being simulated, it should be possible 
<br>
(difficult, but possible) to design an experiment to test this.  Once 
<br>
tested and if found to be true, we may be able to derive information 
<br>
about the containing universe.  The fact that this information turns out 
<br>
to contradict our logic, or to be too complex for us to understand (or 
<br>
that there is an attempt by some malevolent entity to &quot;hide&quot; it from us) 
<br>
is a separate issue entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My point is, this problem DOES apply to everything, even the rolling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dice, because your logic could always be tampered with, and your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception of the likelihood that your logic was tampered with could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always be tampered with as well. The unthinkable is a crack in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality which has an unknown size. It might be a hairline, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be a chasm.
</em><br>
<p>That's true, a simulated universe means that we can't make any 
<br>
assumptions about the relevance of our logic to the containing universe. 
<br>
However I don't see any reason for supposing that our logic has been 
<br>
tampered with in order to hide the fact of simulation. To me this 
<br>
assumes that there is an entity performing the simulation, which I don't 
<br>
think is a valid assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     To me, the incompleteness of the information available about our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     universe is the crux of the problem: we simply don't know enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     for certain whether we are living in a simulation, much less to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     guesses about the nature of the universe which may or may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     simulating us. Needless to say it would be very interesting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     find out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only thing that makes me think we're in a simulation is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical problem of &quot;why&quot;. Simulation doesn't solve this, but it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a probable step in any infinite chain of cause and effect. From all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearances, our intelligence was born of evolution, and earthly life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was born of emergent structures, and a universe with only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergent-level order certainly does not require a designer.
</em><br>
<p>I absolutely agree.  However, this does not preclude the possibility 
<br>
that we are being modelled by random processes. The lack of information 
<br>
either way remains the biggest difficulty, and needs to be discovered 
<br>
empirically if we are to have any hope of resolving this question.
<br>
