<p>Mental blocks or biases are fundamental to all machine learning algorithms. 
<br>
You can't have an intelligent system without them.  The most fundamental bias
<br>
is to prefer algorithmically simple explanations over complex ones.  But this
<br>
is not computable.  So we have approximations, such as explanations that can
<br>
be represented with e.g. linear regression, particular neural architectures,
<br>
or finite strings of DNA.
<br>
<p>In the case of the human brain, biases are shaped by evolution.  Animals that
<br>
fear death are more likely to pass on their DNA than those that don't. 
<br>
Therefore you fear death.  Animals that react as if sensory input comes from a
<br>
real world with real consequences, as opposed to meaningless bits of data, are
<br>
more likely to survive.  Therefore you believe that the world is real. 
<br>
Animals that experiment with their environment learn more than those that
<br>
don't.  Therefore you believe in free will and consciousness.
<br>
<p>Biases like these which are built into the brain override logic.  Logic tells
<br>
you that the brain is a computer.  Logic tells you that it does not require a
<br>
consciousness to function.  Logic tells you there is no test to distinguish
<br>
between an actual consciousness and a belief in consciousness.  But your bias
<br>
says &quot;I exist&quot;.  This conflict leads to bizarre conclusions.  For example,
<br>
uploading.  If you make an identical copy of yourself and then the original
<br>
dies, then your consciousness transfers to the copy.  But what if you don't
<br>
die?  Which of you is &quot;you&quot;?
<br>
<p>So yes, there is a powerful intelligence controlling your thought.  It is
<br>
evolution.  The information content of all the DNA on earth far exceeds that
<br>
of your brain.  Logic says your brain is a computer.  But if you actually
<br>
believed it, your DNA would not propagate.
