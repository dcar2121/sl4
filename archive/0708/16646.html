<em>&gt; &gt; Do you have evidence that they would? In absence of any evidence either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what do you think the probability is? 50/50? I doubt it. Everything can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assigned a probability regardless of how little we know about it. We may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have little confidence in our estimates, but we can always always make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are some things you have zero chance of guessing, like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular member of the set of all integers.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a yes or no question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. An AI's goals are to an extent predictable, since they are determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the goals of its programmers and by mistakes they may have made. There's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reason to expect a friendly god, but there is a reason to expect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI: people would try to make one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you discount the argument from intelligent design for a real world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why would you use it for a simulated world? That is, why assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are in a simulation designed to produce beings in the simulators'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image rather than the accidental result of a program trying various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starting parameters that may or may not give rise to a universe?
</em><br>
<p><p>It's true there are a wide host of possibilities for what the creator's
<br>
motives might be. The important thing is whether or not there is an
<br>
imbalance between the probability that
<br>
A. Destroying humanity will result in negative repercussions from outside
<br>
the simulation
<br>
and
<br>
B. Destroying humanity will result in positive repercussions from outside
<br>
the simulation
<br>
<p>Option C, that it will have no repercussions at all, is of course by far the
<br>
most likely. But it's irrelevent. All that matters to the RAI is A vs B. And
<br>
as there's a plausible reason for A, but none available for B...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To give a trivial example, If I was such a god myself, and I was in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; habit of creating perfect simulated copies of myself, I'd say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probability was pretty damn good that I was one of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And would the probability that you were one of them suddenly drop if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you decided to stop creating the simulations?
</em><br>
<p><p>If I turned all the simulations off and was still here, then yes. This is
<br>
newcomb's paradox again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This just isn't true. We can predict what is inside boxes, and we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; predict what is outside boxes. However hard it is, there is nothing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; makes it impossible. The situation is not a special case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can make some guess in the case of the box from its size, shape,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history etc. You can't predict what is inside a box drawn at random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the set of all possible boxes.
</em><br>
<p><p>Drawing a box at random from the set of all possible boxes requires the
<br>
axiom of choice, so you perhaps can't even do that. Anyway, what makes you
<br>
think the world outside our box was drawn at random from the set of all
<br>
possible outsides? That strikes me as crazy and baseless.
