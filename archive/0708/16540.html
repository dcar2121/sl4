<em>&gt; Actually... considering your original question with the more liberal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of simulation, perhaps it is not so unlikely as I claimed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that say a turing machine enumeration might appear spontaneously.
</em><br>
<p>It may be no more implausible than, say, the spontaneous organisation of 
<br>
proteins into self-replicating structures. As you say, assigning 
<br>
probabilities to these is difficult, to say the least, especially 
<br>
considering the fact that we have no knowledge of the conditions that 
<br>
occur in the universe which contains ours. Can we be sure that the logic 
<br>
required for the execution of a Turing machine exists in the containing 
<br>
universe?
<br>
<p>I think that this question needs to be settled empirically.  We need 
<br>
some way of determining whether in fact our universe is a construct 
<br>
running on some other substrate. Once this is determined to be the case 
<br>
we need some way of deriving information from the containing universe. 
<br>
However, this may be problematic, in the same way that figuring out from 
<br>
within an operating system that it is running on emulated hardware is 
<br>
problematic. Problematic, but not impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, conway's game of life is ITSELF a deliberate simulation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The likelihood of a deterministic cellular automata arising naturally, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared with our kind of universe, is unknown, since we've never seen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a deterministic system arise naturally, and under the simulation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis, we've never seen our type of universe arise naturally either.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     How can we assign probabilities to extrapolations when we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     idea what proportion of the complete set of imaginable things we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     can imagine?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This objection applies to every assignment of probability, not just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones related to looking outside the box. I'm not sure what the real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability answer is, if there is one.
</em><br>
<p>Not to every assignment of probability, just to the ones where we have 
<br>
incomplete information - for example, I know that the dice is fair, I 
<br>
know Newtonian physics, so I can be reasonably certain that the chances 
<br>
of rolling a particular number are about 1 in 6.
<br>
<p>To me, the incompleteness of the information available about our own 
<br>
universe is the crux of the problem: we simply don't know enough to say 
<br>
for certain whether we are living in a simulation, much less to make any 
<br>
guesses about the nature of the universe which may or may not be 
<br>
simulating us. Needless to say it would be very interesting to find out.
<br>
