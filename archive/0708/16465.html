Hi.  I'm new here.
<br>
<p>Somebody quoted Tom McCabe as saying:
<br>
<em> &gt; &gt; Evolution has not had any significant influence on human
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; species for the past thousand years due to time limits and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; the recent lack of selection pressure see
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &gt; <a href="http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/jcollie/sle/">http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/jcollie/sle/</a>.
</em><br>
<p>I think we still have selection pressure, but the most important part
<br>
of the environment for humans is other humans.  Thus sexual selection
<br>
remains, as does the tendency of some to survive genocide attempts
<br>
better than others.  (What do you call the latter?  It's not natural
<br>
selection and it's not sexual selection.)
<br>
<p>Not that it matters much.  Editing genomes is almost possible now, and
<br>
it's pretty clear that it will be easy before there's enough time for
<br>
much more natural evolution to happen.  And if a powerful AI is
<br>
created, that radical change will make minor genetic differences
<br>
between humans seem unimportant.  So why are we talking about human
<br>
evolution?
<br>
<p>I agree with the cited URL that the rate of information change driven
<br>
by evolution is slow.  However, I don't know whether there are
<br>
radically different ways of being that differ from the status quo by
<br>
only a few bits, so I don't know how to draw useful inferences from
<br>
the speed limit on evolution.
<br>
