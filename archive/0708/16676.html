<em>&gt; They might announce it as soon as they hear of Rolf Nelson's idea.
</em><br>
<p><p>I very much doubt that they WILL announce it, as soon as they hear of rolf's
<br>
idea or at any point afterward. If you believe in god anyway, the idea of
<br>
replacing divine judgment with a machine is blasphemous and accomplishes
<br>
nothing. In any case, I imagine most people would get to about &quot;ESSAY: How
<br>
to deter a rogue AI by&quot; before they stopped reading.
<br>
<p>In fact, every special interest group could make a similar proposal,
<br>
<p><p>But they won't, and no one would take them seriously if they did.
<br>
<p>having only to commit to run the simulation when computing resources
<br>
<em>&gt; become cheap enough, which eventually they will.
</em><br>
<p><p>Hopefully by that point the computing resources will be regulated such that
<br>
this sort of tomfoolery is not allowed. By the friendly post-singularity
<br>
whatsit.
<br>
<p>The differences between your hypothetical situation and rolf's plan are:
<br>
<p>A. First mover advantage. When the RAI appears, the battle for the future
<br>
has already been won, either by the RAI or by whatever is simulating it.
<br>
Here in 2007, we're still FIGHTING the battle. All your situation really
<br>
consists of is some fatuous imps saying WOULDN'T YOU RATHER BE ON THE
<br>
WINNING SIDE?
<br>
<p>B. Two-way interaction. In rolf's plan, the simulated and nonsimulated RAIs
<br>
are in separate branches and thus the real RAI has no way to stop itself
<br>
from being simulated.* In your thing, we can go to the house of whoever says
<br>
JOIN ME OR DIE and punch them in the face.
<br>
<p>C. Goal conflict. Under your system, by cooperating we help doom a
<br>
significant fraction of humanity to hell, which for many people would be
<br>
regarded as Bad Thing. Under rolf's plan, all the AI loses by cooperating is
<br>
the raw material humanity is composed of, which it barely cares about one
<br>
way or the other.
<br>
<p>And even if your situation was plausible, and everyone, simply everyone
<br>
built some kind of simulated karma trap, I doubt the influence they'd exert
<br>
would balance out by pulling equally in all directions. People certainly
<br>
have their disagreements, but they have agreements as well. If we were truly
<br>
at complete odds with each other, we'd never have have gotten to the point
<br>
of multicellular life.
<br>
<p>*It's true that the RAI could simulate its simulators in an effort to deter
<br>
them, but it's unclear if this would be advantageous even if it didn't cost
<br>
anything and even if it would work. If the RAI's goal is to calculate C,
<br>
having a simulated counterpart with the handicap of having to save humanity
<br>
is actually a great deal. It's like an extra life.
