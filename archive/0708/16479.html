<em>&gt; I don't think there's an answer to your last question, but I can think of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful way to rephrase it: Assume there's an AI right now; where is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiding, and who knows it's there?
</em><br>
<p>It is feeding your sensory inputs with data simulating the universe you now
<br>
experience.  You don't know it is there because it has total control over your
<br>
thoughts.  Does anyone else know?  The question assumes that other people
<br>
exist.
<br>
<p>How do you know?  All we know is that the universe is consistent with a
<br>
simulation.  For example, AIXI theory predicts that if the universe is Turing
<br>
computable, then the algorithmically simplest models consistent with past
<br>
observations will be the best predictors of future results, regardless of the
<br>
experiment.  This is in agreement with our observation of Occam's Razor.
<br>
<p>Suppose we create superhuman intelligence and upload?  What would you want it
<br>
to do?  You could live in any simulated universe you wanted, limited only by
<br>
its computing power.  What would your universe be like?  Would you choose to
<br>
remember that the singularity has already happened, or would you choose the
<br>
appearance of realism?
