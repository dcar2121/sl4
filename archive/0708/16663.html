</em><br>
<p>That's a good point.  I think you're right, that we can't really tell
<br>
whether the void is still expanding (as long as it's expanding slower
<br>
than lightspeed).  So I take my rhetorical question about &quot;why would
<br>
it have stopped?&quot;  For some reason, I didn't think of that when I
<br>
wrote that.
<br>
<p>But the other two issues still seem puzzling.  How any sort of
<br>
intelligence would have developed that early on (3-7 billion years
<br>
after the big bang, when it took 4.5 billion years on earth... and the
<br>
universe looked very different and less life-friendly back then).  And
<br>
if they're living there but hiding... how they could unbend the light
<br>
passing through in such a way that it looks like there is no
<br>
gravitational disturbance there.  Another question is how/why they are
<br>
cooling the cosmic background radiation as it passes through, but that
<br>
actually seems to have a rather simple answer in the context of
<br>
superhuman intelligence... they could be harvesting energy from the
<br>
cosmic background radiation too (perhaps large antennas set up to
<br>
collect it?)  If there's a way to do that technologically, it might
<br>
provide them with even more energy than they could get out of the
<br>
stars!  (Just speculating here).  But the only way to explain why the
<br>
amount of cooling happens to be exactly what you'd expect if there
<br>
were nothing there is that they are deliberately trying to trick
<br>
outside observers into thinking there's nothing there.  So the
<br>
question still is... why do they go through all that trouble to hide?
