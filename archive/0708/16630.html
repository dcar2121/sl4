<p>It would probably be easier for the FAI to short circuit anything the RAI*

did which be expensive to simulate, unless these things were necessary for
<br>
the RAI to complete its goal. Whether it's shaking the walls in order to
<br>
ascertain whether it's in a simulation, or simply as a consequence of normal
<br>
operating procedure, the FAI could simply make up plausible data on the fly,
<br>
and hack the parts of RAI* which would notice anything is fishy.
