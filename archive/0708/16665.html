<em>&gt; There is a temptation to guess that the outside bears some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship to the inside, but there is no basis for this. Is there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any way to know what is &quot;outside&quot; the universe, in the event that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is such a thing?
</em><br>
<p><p>The fact that the outside contains the inside is a relationship. You're
<br>
confusing the idea that the simulation could be a perfect copy of reality
<br>
with the idea that there is no information to work with, when in fact these
<br>
things are quite different.
<br>
<p>If I wake up in the morning in what seems to be my room, then it probably is
<br>
my room, and not a perfect copy of my room. If there was a TV show where
<br>
people are drugged and kidnapped during the night and placed inside a
<br>
perfect copy of their room, then the probability that my room was a copy
<br>
would be slightly greater, and if you win a billion dollars on this game
<br>
show if the first thing you do upon waking is yell &quot;Q Q Q Q&quot; then I might
<br>
make that part of my morning routine, because even though the probability
<br>
I'm on the show is tiny, the ratio of investment is so small, and the payoff
<br>
is so big.
<br>
<p>The situation with the RAI is EXACTLY the same, and the fact that it
<br>
involves AIs and computer simulations and universes is irrelevant.

<p>Isn't the set of all possible boxes uncountable? I assumed it was, since you

could write write every real number on a slip of paper and put each paper in
<br>
a box. I guess if we're limited to finite boxes that doesn't work.
