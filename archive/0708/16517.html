<em>&gt; Most 2D games still have the APPEARANCE of a third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dimension, and most 3D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; games have action confined to a surface. It's fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; clear in both cases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they are made to be played on a 2D screen, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thus by 3D people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm.. according to the string theorists, space-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is ten-dimensional. Therefore, it's meant to be played
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by eleven-dimensional creatures. Maybe there's a cheat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code hidden somewhere in the sixth dimension?
</em><br>
<p><p>Most of the dimensions are small enough that they are functionally
<br>
nonexistent on the macroscale. If the universe were a video game, it would
<br>
easily be playable on a 2D screen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Due to the nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; singularity, their existence is currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; impossible to describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me the very fact that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;post-singularity level beings&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the beginning of a description.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So is calling something a &quot;thingy&quot;. So is calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something an &quot;n-rank tensor in k-dimensional space&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trying to get useful information from the statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;post-singularity level beings&quot; is on roughly the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order of absurdity as trying to derive general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativity from knowing &quot;the curvature of space-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an n-rank tensor&quot; (and nothing else).
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm just saying, the idea that things are &quot;impossible to describe&quot; seems a
<br>
like a bit of an exaggeration to me. It's an H. P. Lovecraft cop-out.
<br>
<p>&quot;What is water? It's a difficult question, because water is impossible to
<br>
describe. It's sort of like birds. What are birds? We just don't know.&quot;
<br>
- Look Around You
<br>
<p><em>&gt; while a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; post-singularity entity could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and do almost anything, what it WOULD do depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; optimization target of whoever orchestrated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; singularity, and whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something went wrong and that target became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; corrupted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but we don't know the specifics of how any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this happened. You might as well try and solve for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion unknowns with one equation.
</em><br>
<p><p>It's certainly difficult, but functionally different answers could be
<br>
enumerated, and their relative probability estimated.
<br>
<p>For instance, it is unlikely the universe was simulated to solve the math
<br>
problem &quot;what is six times seven&quot; even though the solution to this problem
<br>
exists within the universe, because simulating a whole universe is not an
<br>
efficient way to do simple math.
<br>
<p>It's POSSIBLE. But it seems to me less likely than that the universe was
<br>
simulated, for instance, just to see what happens. Wouldn't you agree?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In either case, the original target was probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something we would not find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; totally alien, if it was the target of evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beings, because evolution is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; likely to create beings that are like us in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ways, regardless of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment. Beings that like surviving, eating, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reproducing. Beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that are just exactly smart enough to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do we know that these creatures *evolved*?
</em><br>
<p><p>If they were designed, then they were designed according to the motivations
<br>
of those designers, and so on, until we get back to creatures who were not
<br>
designed. I suppose it's possible that they just spontaneously sprang into
<br>
being, or that their brains and bodies were formed by the accretion of
<br>
sediment layers, but evolution seems more likely.
<br>
<p>How do
<br>
<em>&gt; we know that the Second Law of Thermodynamics operates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in their universe? How do we know that one plus one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would equal two?
</em><br>
<p><p>These things are part of the complex fundamental logic of our universe, to
<br>
which no alternative is known, or is even possible for us to simulate. The
<br>
likelihood that the world outside the system operates by a system of rules
<br>
which is known to exist is greater than likelihood it operates by a
<br>
hypothetical system which is not.
<br>
<p>Additionally, order is known to beget order. A vast surrealist nightmare is
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>You can dream up whatever kind of beings you want, so
<br>
<em>&gt; long as they have adequate technology, and then cook
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up a plausible-sounding argument for why they would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulate us. To shamelessly steal Eliezer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminology, the hypothesis of a &quot;universe simulation&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not forbid any outcomes; it does not serve to let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us anticipate the future. It is a disguised hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of complete ignorance.
</em><br>
<p><p>It seems to me much less likely that a pre-singularity civilization would
<br>
simulate a universe than a post-singularity one, I just think it's a
<br>
possibility which should be explored further before being discarded.
<br>
<p>While the simulation hypothesis does not forbid any outcomes, it gives them
<br>
different probability weights. I disagree with Eliezer that it is a
<br>
disguised hypothesis of complete ignorance.
