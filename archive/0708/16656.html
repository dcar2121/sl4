<p>Hmmm... this giant hole they're talking about is 6-10 billion light
<br>
years from us.  Which means it's about 4-8 billion light years after
<br>
the big bang.  They say the size is nearly a billion light years
<br>
across.  So that means the civilization would have had to come to
<br>
maturity 3-7 billion years after the big bang and then spend at least
<br>
a billion years colonizing the region and harvesting all the matter.
<br>
That seem pretty early for intelligent life to develop, but maybe.
<br>
Although if it did, then why did they stop there rather than continue
<br>
for the next 6-10 billion years colonizing other regions around it?

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It's not the radiation from stars they are looking at.  They mention
<br>
the dark matter is completely missing too, which means they detected
<br>
this hole by looking at the gravitational lensing effects (or lack
<br>
thereof, in this case).  So blocking radiation from just the stars
<br>
would not be able to hide the matter or the dark matter from us.  They
<br>
would have to build some sort of gravitational shielding device that
<br>
cancels out the effects of gravity so we don't see them... or
<br>
something that unbends the light passing through the region so that it
<br>
looks like the space there is curved differently than it is.  If such
<br>
technology exists, it would be a sign of an extremely advanced
<br>
civilization.
