<p>SP&gt; All simulations which provide an identical 1st person POV are
<br>
SP&gt; equivalent, and in a significant sense redundant, because it is
<br>
SP&gt; impossible even in principle to know which one you are in. If the
<br>
SP&gt; number of simulations were suddenly increased or decreased, it would
<br>
SP&gt; be impossible for you to know that anything unusual had happened: your
<br>
SP&gt; next subjective moment will be in one and only one simulation, any of
<br>
SP&gt; the simulations will do as that one simulation, so provided there is
<br>
SP&gt; at least one simulation available to choose from you can never know
<br>
SP&gt; what's &quot;really&quot; going on.
<br>
<p>What then if ALL the simulations are available at least once, through
<br>
TM enumerator? Does it mean that ALL other simulators are irrelevant,
<br>
as for each simulation there is at least one protected identical simulation (with
<br>
identical past and future) running on TM enumerator?
<br>
<p>SP&gt; However, if there are two or more competing &quot;next moments&quot; then the
<br>
SP&gt; number of simulations is relevant. If there are X simulations in which
<br>
SP&gt; you are tortured and Y simulations in which you are not tortured in
<br>
SP&gt; the next moment, then you have a X/(X+Y) chance of being tortured.
<br>
<p>You can't distinguish between worlds where you will be tortured, and you can't distinguish
<br>
between the worlds where you won't. You also can't distinguish between
<br>
all these worlds together prior to potential torture time point. Even
<br>
if you assume subjective POV is located in individual simulations, you
<br>
can't jump to different simulation. All you can do is prepare to
<br>
different future possibilities to a different degree, to balance
<br>
resources among possible futures. Will your actions be different if
<br>
ratio of futures with torture to futures without is 1000:1 or
<br>
1:1000? In all 1000 simulations of that or another outcome you will be
<br>
a completely identical entity, thinking the same thoughts about the
<br>
same events, at the same moments. How is 1000 of identical copies
<br>
experiencing torture worse than 1 copy experiencing torture, if it's
<br>
the same experience?
<br>
<p>To the point of my previous message: how do you count simulations?
<br>
What is your solution to that counting paradox I wrote about in previous message?
<br>
Does a presence of 2^N simulations within a single implementation
<br>
somehow influence probability of you being in certain simulation?
