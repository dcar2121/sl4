<p>A more recent example is the change in the prevalence of sickle-cell

among American Blacks compared to their relatives in Africa due to lack

of malarial mosquitoes in North America.

<p>While this isn't a case of /new/ attributes coming into prevalence, it's 
<br>
certainly an example of selection.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I'm also not convinced that this has had any significant

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Hmm.   That seems like an unusual reading of the effect of evolution on 
<br>
history in the case of the Ashkenazim.  The usual story that I hear is 
<br>
that some difference in their genetics led them to contribute a higher 
<br>
proportion of high-IQ individuals to the population.  Around the time 
<br>
between WWI and WWII, these people ended up making a large difference in 
<br>
events in western Europe and around the world.  Whether they maintained 
<br>
their religion during and after making a difference to the course of 
<br>
history doesn't seem to affect whether their presence made a difference.
