<p>SP&gt; By TM enumerator I take it you mean a program that enumerates all

SP&gt; possible programs, like a universal dovetailer. In the sense I have
<br>
SP&gt; described, then yes, all the other simulations are irrelevant.
<br>
SP&gt; However, where there are multiple competing futures (as below) the
<br>
SP&gt; weighting of each one matters. There are theories in which it is
<br>
SP&gt; assumed that the universe is the set of all possible programs (which
<br>
SP&gt; perhaps need only exist as Platonic objects), but I don't know if it
<br>
SP&gt; has been successfully shown that this idea yields the known laws of
<br>
SP&gt; physics.
<br>
<p>It yields all laws of physics, including ours, as long as they are
<br>
computable. (It doesn't seem possible to ever prove as a result of
<br>
observations that some laws of physics are not computable. Observations
<br>
are finite. When a decision is drawn by experts, it's equivalent to
<br>
experts' minds being is a particular configuration set, which is also
<br>
a finite thing.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; SP&gt; However, if there are two or more competing &quot;next moments&quot; then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SP&gt; number of simulations is relevant. If there are X simulations in which

</em><br>
<p>I think I found a better argument about this point. Certainly one
<br>
tries to anticipate the future, but this behaviour is grounded in
<br>
anticipation of _future experience_. And future experience itself
<br>
does not depend on number of times it's simulated.
<br>
<p>When you use probability theory to make rational choices, you do it
<br>
only because you anticipate that they will pay off in your future
<br>
experience, in dominating bulk of possible futures. Still, you usually
<br>
sacrifice those possible futures where fate plays against you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; To the point of my previous message: how do you count simulations?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What is your solution to that counting paradox I wrote about in previous message?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Does a presence of 2^N simulations within a single implementation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; somehow influence probability of you being in certain simulation?
</em><br>
<p>SP&gt; If I understand you correctly, you are suggesting that doubling the
<br>
SP&gt; number of implementations in a recursive simulation will increase the
<br>
SP&gt; total number of entities in that implementation not by a factor of 2,
<br>
SP&gt; but by a factor of 2^N, with N being the number of levels. I don't see
<br>
SP&gt; why this shouldn't also increase the weighting by 2^N for the purpose
<br>
SP&gt; of probability calculations, although this does provide a possible
<br>
SP&gt; experimental method to determine if we are in a recursive simulation.
<br>
<p>That's not what I meant, but details don't really matter. This
<br>
counting issue raises just another serious problem of simulations.
<br>
What really counts as simulation of certain mathematical model of
<br>
simulated universe? Any implementation arranges matter of host
<br>
universe in certain patterns. Why some patterns are said to provide
<br>
simulations and not others? Matter of host universe has no direct
<br>
correspondence to 'matter' of simulated universe. To establish that
<br>
implementation X (particular pattern of matter in host universe) is
<br>
a simulation of universe model Y (mathematical description), one needs
<br>
an interpretation procedure F that can take X as an input, convert it to
<br>
the same mathemetical notation and compare to Y, F(X)=Y. Presence of this
<br>
procedure (which nobody needs to actually build in order to simulation
<br>
to be a genuine one) is somehow implied, if X is developed to
<br>
implement Y. But how complex is F allowed to be? If it doesn't need to
<br>
be implemented, can't it include whole simulation, so that X is nil
<br>
and F(nil)=Y?
<br>
<p>As a simple example, say, state of simulated universe is a finite 2D binary
<br>
image, of size AxB. When is it considered simulated? If a program
<br>
stores this state in computer memory and performs computation that
<br>
modifies it every simulated tick according to simulation's laws of physics, and
<br>
outputs the image to a monitor screen, it seems to simulate that
<br>
universe. But will it cease to simulate it if I turn monitor off?
<br>
Will it simulate it twice if I install two monitors in parallel?
<br>
It's only meaningful to say that implementation provides a way to
<br>
access information about simulated universe.
<br>
<p><p>I'm mainly interested in this issue because I have doubts about
<br>
uploads not being p-zombies. These handy-wavy theories of simulated
<br>
experience are full of paradoxes. I agree that one can't in principle
<br>
prove that given observed entity has conscience, but at least there
<br>
should be a consistent theory of what conscience is. In this case, I
<br>
take a universe containing a conscious observer as a consciousness
<br>
vessel, so that genuine simulation corresponds to implementation of
<br>
consciousness.
