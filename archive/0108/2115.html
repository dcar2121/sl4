<em>&gt; From: James Higgins &lt;<a href="mailto:jameshiggins@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Opting%20out%20of%20the%20Sysop%20scenario?">jameshiggins@earthlink.net</a>&gt;

<p>[ ... stuff that Brian Atkins replied too ... ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;In a VR enhanced society with Friendliness, we can live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;out our fantasies, whatever they are, in complete safety with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to other sentient beings. A lowest level prevention mechanism of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;physical operating system would prevent one sentient from actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;harming another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not exactly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Acting out your fantasies might be incredibly difficult.  According to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested rules you can't simulate people in VR.  If they are a &quot;real&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person you are simulating, acting out your fantasies with a simulation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them is deemed to violate them.  Second, if you create a simulation of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person it becomes a citizen, permanently get assigned the computing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources you allocated to it and gets its own full volition.  Thus you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't simulate anything.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I can imagine the situation differently. One way to make a truly
<br>
interactive imaginary character would be to create an autonomous, conscious,
<br>
free willed software system that has feelings and reacts like a human would.
<br>
<p>But another way is to trick yourself into believing that such a creature
<br>
exists. You could send your brain (or thinking software if you like) the 
<br>
stimulation of a character that &quot;as you perceive&quot; acts the way you want.
<br>
At ILM we do this all the time. The pixels you see that represent invented
<br>
characters are not modelled with internal senses and sensibilities. In VR,
<br>
we could try to model these internal states and behaviors, but taken to 
<br>
the extreme, these &quot;synthespians&quot; would eventually qualify as citizens. 
<br>
I think the whole thing can be avoided by tricking your brain, instead, 
<br>
without ever &quot;giving birth&quot; to an actual sentient entity, it would be 
<br>
pure illusion, pixels flashing, the sensation of your sking being touched, 
<br>
your hair feeling the wind, without any wind in the first place. Not a 
<br>
single emotion would be modelled in the other character. It would all
<br>
be entirely superficial yet entirely convincing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, its more about sealing the human race into a logical cell with no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of escape in an emergency.
</em><br>
<p>Hey Brian, guess what? You're currently trapped in your body. You cope. 
<br>
You get used to it. You can actually enjoy it and not worry that you
<br>
are &quot;trapped&quot; (until you can actually upload, that is, and then somato-
<br>
paranoia might be helpful). 
<br>
<p>I guess the difference is that you weren't around before your body
<br>
was, on some mailing list speculating on what future &quot;reality&quot; would be 
<br>
like (well, not that we know of anyway). If you'd had a say back in
<br>
the hypothetical then, maybe you could have prevented this entrapment.
<br>
<p>As Brian says, you have a choice about living under the sysop or not...
<br>
hmm I have to ask a question about that next...
