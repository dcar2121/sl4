<p>
One possibility I'd add is that Friendliness science, or whatever the
<br>
equivalent is post-Singularity, may advance to the point of being able
<br>
to prove whether or not you are Friendly and will stay Friendly. So it
<br>
might be possible to let the Sysop scan your mind and prove to it that
<br>
it can safely let you off on your own without having to worry about what
<br>
you might do. I don't see what the advantage of this would be for you
<br>
though- the only conceivable reason to want to live outside Sysop Space
<br>
would be to do something bad.
<br>
<p>As for Sysop failure scenarios I don't see what you're worrying about.
<br>
If it turns out that implementing such a scenario would not scale well
<br>
then the initial FAI will probably not implement it. If it does create
<br>
a Sysop, it will be designed to handle natural disasters. There is the
<br>
remote chance it runs into a foreign unFriendly AI or something that
<br>
it can't beat, in that case it would probably advise all the Citizens
<br>
to run for their lives. There's nothing preventing them from spreading
<br>
all over the galaxy and further anyway, whether the Sysop is alive or
<br>
dead. If you want to go to Alpha Centauri, the Sysop can attach a
<br>
chunk of itself to your ship to go with you and start a fresh copy of
<br>
itself there in that solar system.
<br>
<p>I have to recommend again to think of it like UNIX perms or something.
<br>
It is there for a good reason. It is rather mechanistic in its basic
<br>
actions, and does not &quot;go wrong&quot; out of the blue. It provides a basic
<br>
security feature without which you would be utterly screwed. It'd be
<br>
like running an old copy of Linux with all the security holes unpatched
<br>
just waiting for someone else to exploit you. In other words the
<br>
potential disaster you are worrying about (Sysop run amok, we're trapped
<br>
in it) doesn't go away if a Sysop doesn't currently exist. It can happen
<br>
any time any where. In an anarchist future with no Sysop, anyone is
<br>
free to create one with their local computronium. It seems quite
<br>
inevitable to me that there will be eventual control established over
<br>
most matter- the question is how does it play out? Do the more agressive
<br>
transhuman minds squabble and fight over it leading to a software/nanotech
<br>
arms race? Wouldn't the end result of that be one or a few people ending
<br>
up with most of the matter for themselves, using some kind of Sysop-like
<br>
(sans-Friendliness obviously) software to maintain control over it? That's
<br>
just one scenario, but it doesn't sound very nice or less risky than the
<br>
traditional Sysop idea.
<br>
<p>The idea that we will all fly off in our space ships and live happily
<br>
ever after just doesn't work for me :-)
