<em>&gt;Concerning the question of trade post-singularity, Christian L. &gt;scoffed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What kind of information/code can you not get from the Sysop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) Any information/code protected by intellectual property rules
</em><br>
<p>The function of the Sysop is to give me what I want without violating the 
<br>
volition of others. Intellectual property rules are a way of saying: My wish 
<br>
is that you do not own this information/code. This is a request, but it 
<br>
violates my volition, because I want that information. The person I get it 
<br>
from is not harmed in any way by the fact that I can copy that information. 
<br>
Therefore intellectual property would probably not be allowed in the sysop 
<br>
scenario. Information would be free.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;2) Any information/code created directly for you as the basis of a trade
</em><br>
<p>...could be created by the Sysop for free (granting a request).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;3) Any information/code the Sysop decides for whatever reason it doen't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to give you.  Maybe it will think that self-reliance builds character.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is not what I call Friendly behaviour since it violates my 
<br>
violition. Compare: Maybe it thinks that agonizing pain builds character 
<br>
(what doesn't kill you makes you stronger). If the sysop think I need 
<br>
character building, it could ask my premission to alter my &quot;mind-file&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Wouldn't the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sysop be the best journalist or provide the best entertainment/art?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) If you think only the best journalist or artist is worth your &gt;regard, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our
</em><br>
<p>Not so. My point with the painting was: if you like the writing of a 
<br>
(non-sysop) journalist, you get a copy of his work at Sysop Times[TM].
<br>
<p><em>&gt;points of view are so dissimilar I doubt the rest of this conversation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;help.
</em><br>
<p>Dissimilarity can be stimulating, don't you agree?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;2) I assume the Sysop will be a special purpose AI who does not fill all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;roles of a general AI citizen, for the same reason judges are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advocates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and high goverment officials are not concurrently in business (except for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corrupt regimes like our current administration), the conflict of interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between the various roles would degrade the Sysop's ability to fulfill its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;primary functions.
</em><br>
<p>I don't follow you... Are you saying for example that the Sysop cannot run a 
<br>
newspaper because all the articles would be pro-Sysop? The primary function 
<br>
is to be the granter of wishes. How would that function degrade if it has 
<br>
various roles?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If a human made a great painting, you could always tell the Sysop to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; replicate one for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For free?  No royalties?  You could also tell it to steal it.  The question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is whether it would do what you ask.  (Napster has a lot to answer for!)
</em><br>
<p>See intellectual property above. No, the Sysop wouldn't steal the painting, 
<br>
that would violate the painter's volition (I assume she would like to keep 
<br>
her painting). Why would I want to steal it when I can have a perfect copy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Security? The primary goal of the Sysop is security. What use would a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bodyguard have if no one can harm you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1) The Sysop will certainly provide basic security services to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;major harms.  Whether it will provide all possible security services, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether it will agree with you as to what constitutes a harm are separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions.
</em><br>
<p>Violation of volition is harm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;People hire nontech security now not only to backstop the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;police, but also to do things the police won't, like put their bodies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inbetween papparazi cameras and famous faces.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, privacy is an interesting question. Personally I think that my need for 
<br>
knowing what color your underpants are overrides your need to keep that fact 
<br>
to yourself. (So, tell me already! ;) ) I cannot see what purpose not 
<br>
letting anyone know that information would have, since noone can use the 
<br>
information (or any information) to harm you.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;2) Conspicuous consumption.  (Or do you think that come the revolution we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will outlaw conspicuous consumption?)
</em><br>
<p>Since I had never heard this term before, I googled it and found:
<br>
<p>&quot;In the late nineteenth century, the economist and sociologist Thorstein 
<br>
Veblen
<br>
coined the term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; to describe the ostentatious
<br>
squandering of resources by the wealthy classes.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, you would buy security just to show off that you have money(energy)? I 
<br>
think you would be hard pressed to find someone willing to give you their 
<br>
energy in the first place.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;If you want to learn something, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be the best teacher? A human or a Superintelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This may be the heart of our disagreement.  I envisage a future with many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Superintelligences&quot;, an entire ecology, not just us humans and single
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parent Sysop.
</em><br>
<p>This is indeed possible, but the Sysop would still be the smartest, no? If 
<br>
not, some UnFriendly AI could take over. And if you can be tought by the 
<br>
smartest for free, why pay for someone less smart?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I assume specialization will triumph over one omnicompetent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supercitizen.
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't those specializations be sub-processes of the Sysop?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Perhaps we could design a world where each person only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interacted with the Sysop, who recreated an entire artificial world for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of us designed to make us happy, but do we want to?
</em><br>
<p>&quot;We&quot; has nothing to do with it. As Maggie Thatcher said: there is no 
<br>
society, only individuals. If someone wants to sit blissed out in a 
<br>
VR-world, that is what he'll do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think one part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eli's design of friendliness, with an accent on preserving citizen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;autonomy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to design an AI that would reject that type of Sysop role.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if by &quot;that role&quot; you mean forcing everyone to sit blissed out in front 
<br>
of their proverbial TV-screens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sysop, and friendly major powers generally, to leave to lesser powers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans (which may become lesser powers eventually for all we know) those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tasks that they can handle.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, everyone will do what he wishes. But each task that a lesser Power can 
<br>
handle, the Sysop can handle better. Therefore, no need to pay a lesser 
<br>
Power to do something when you can get it for free from the Sysop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And frankly, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you are so extremely shy that you need to PAY people to talk to you, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sysop kan kindly ask your permission to rewire some basic social skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Considering the billions people currently pay for conversation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated activities, from therapy and sexwork to bars and bowling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;leagues,
</em><br>
<p>Therapy can be done easily with rewiring. If you want to talk to a stranger 
<br>
about your problems, talk to a Sysop avatar. Same with sex. If the Sysop can 
<br>
take you to unimaginable heights of eroticicm for free, why would you go to 
<br>
a crummy red-light district place and pay for it?
<br>
<p>Or you could always talk about problems with your friends (that is free 
<br>
too). Or have sex with them.
<br>
<p>I don't see why you would pay to go into a bar. Everyone in the bar could 
<br>
use their share of matter/energy to replicate beer, snacks or what have you. 
<br>
Most people you meet in a bar would not charge you for speaking with them, 
<br>
and the same if you want to have sex (and they want it too of course).
<br>
Above goes for bowling too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I suspect that your vision of the future is not that everyone develops
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social skills, but that everyone gives up on them and just lives in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solopsistic world with the Sysop.
</em><br>
<p>That is a scenario, given the circumstances (Sysop).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Who would pay for a device constructed by a (trans)human when he can get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superior device for free?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You really don't believe in the Prophet Heinlein and the holy word of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;TANSTAAFL, do you?  Again, even if nanomanufacturing is effectively free,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and I expect that will only be true if you keep your desires small, design
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work will be free only if the Sysop is Santa Claus.
</em><br>
<p>The point was that he IS Santa Claus. The scenario would be that the Sysop 
<br>
divides the matter evenly between the people, and you could do what you want 
<br>
with your share.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Otherwise, some designs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be free and some won't.
</em><br>
<p>This would not be considered Friendly.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;What do you mean by trading space? How many cubic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; light-years do you need? For what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I just need a location close to my friends and far away from people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rude or aggravating.  Funny how that always seems to cost something.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to live in meatspace, you could use your share of matter to 
<br>
replicate a space-station where you and your friends could live.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you think some people will not try to grab prime real estate, such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sphere around any star out to the orbit of the third or fourth planet, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have never met a real estate developer.
</em><br>
<p>Strictly speaking, this is not space, this is space and lots of matter. The 
<br>
sysop would distribute the matter evenly, and maybe the space too. If a 
<br>
person grabs all space around the planets of Sol-system and charges everyone 
<br>
who tries to fly there, that would be a breach of the volition of the people 
<br>
who want to fly there.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;Why would there be a shortage of space?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why are land values high in Los Vegas, when there is empty desert all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it?  Why do people pay for domain names, when there are so many unclaimed?
</em><br>
<p>That's because you have lots of infrastructure in Las Vegas and not in the 
<br>
desert. In the sysop scenario, infrastructure is everywhere so one place is 
<br>
probably as good as another.
<br>
<p>If your domain name was a place to live, why would it matter if you lived in 
<br>
nicesite.com instead of xjsjwha.com?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The only truly valuable thing post-singularity is probably only matter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; energy, or only energy if you consider E=mc^2,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I cannot think of any prediction about life after the Singularity &gt;that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less likely to be true.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm... I shouldn't have said &quot;post-singularity&quot;. What I meant was: given the 
<br>
premises of the Sysop-scenario, the only valuables would be energy 
<br>
(Information would be valuable of course but free, so you can't trade it 
<br>
(like James Higgins said)). I am not claiming to make predictions here. I 
<br>
don't think we can understand the post-singularity world, but the Sysop 
<br>
scenario is probably as plausible as anything...
<br>
<p>I am simply arguing about the possible behaviours of creatures with 
<br>
intelligence close to humans in the Sysop scenario. I would wager that there 
<br>
will be no (or very little) trade going on, since you can get just about any 
<br>
information for free and you have only one thing to trade: energy/matter.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;(Again, assuming that we do not all merge into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;single hive mind.)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Here's hoping we are both around to see who was right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I certainly hope to stick around. If we read this conversation as a 
<br>
prediction however, I am predicting that we will both be wrong. ;)
