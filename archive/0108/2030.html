<em>&gt;The distinction between a dumbass and an AI researcher consists of both

<em>&gt;intrinsic smartness and education.  From the tenor of the rest of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;message, I assume you're interested in the intrinsic smartness part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinction.  Psychologists like to reify 'smartness' by something called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 'g factor', which is supposed to differ between people.  IQ tests
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measure the g factor, and the amount of g factor is commonly called IQ.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's a semi-popular article on the topic, most of which I agree with:
</em><br>
<p>Has anyone considered motivation?  Maybe scientists are smarter because 
<br>
they value those specific experiences and thus seek out experiences that 
<br>
would make them smarter?  Actually, this could be tested using identical 
<br>
twins raised separately.   Twin A becomes a scientists, doctor, or other 
<br>
equivalent intellectual.  Twin B becomes an athlete with a degree in basket 
<br>
weaving and can't do algebra straight.  This would obviously be due to 
<br>
motivation (or ?), but certainly not genetics, physiology, etc.
<br>
<p>I bring this up because I have noticed this effect.  When hiring, I 
<br>
actually prefer self-educated, non-degree programmers that show great 
<br>
potential, enjoy what they do and are motivated.  In my experience, 99% of 
<br>
the college educated software engineers could go home and no one would 
<br>
probably notice the difference in productivity.  Nothing personal to those 
<br>
of you who may be college educated software engineers, this is not a 
<br>
universal truth.  A college educated engineer who had been working in the 
<br>
field for years prior to their formal education, enjoyed their work and 
<br>
were motivated would probably be the best candidate.  However, I have yet 
<br>
to come across such a person in my hiring attempts...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Moreover, research on the physiology and genetics of g has uncovered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biological correlates of this psychological phenomenon. In the past decade,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;studies by teams of researchers in North America and Europe have linked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several attributes of the brain to general intelligence. After taking into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;account gender and physical stature, brain size as determined by magnetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resonance imaging is moderately correlated with IQ (about 0.4 on a scale of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;0 to 1). So is the speed of nerve conduction. The brains of bright people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;also use less energy during problem solving than do those of their less able
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peers. And various qualities of brain waves correlate strongly (about 0.5 to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;0.7) with IQ: the brain waves of individuals with higher IQs, for example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respond more promptly and consistently to simple sensory stimuli such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;audible clicks.
</em><br>
<p>But is this genetic or learned?  A brain that solves a lot of a certain 
<br>
type of problem (logical lets say) may become much more efficient when 
<br>
working in that domain.  I'd like to see some studies of very young 
<br>
children and then compare their early results with tests taken when they 
<br>
are 25 or 30.  Of course, we don't have time to wait for these tests.  Oh well.
