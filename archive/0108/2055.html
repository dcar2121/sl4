</em><br>
<p>I would like to interject here that certain some people tend to 
<br>
differ in this (and I'll use myself as an example).
<br>
<p>Here is something of what my typical day is like:
<br>
<p>- wake up, do some regular morning stuff
<br>
- for and hour or two I keep sage busy with e-mail and Web pages
<br>
- eat something
<br>
- for seven or eight hours what now happens is that I sit at the 
<br>
computer unless someone makes me get away and I just change what sage 
<br>
is doing every couple of hours.  It's hard to do the same thing with 
<br>
sage for more than about 3 hours I find, so I just make it do 
<br>
something else.  Maybe I do e-mail for an hour or two, go write code 
<br>
for a few hours, maybe read some, go back to e-mail, etc..  During 
<br>
this time I have to get up sometimes because my body needs to 
<br>
(bathroom, exercise muscles, let other muscles rest, etc.).
<br>
- I have to eat again
<br>
- Relax for a couple hours, maybe watch 30 minutes of TV, read Web comics, etc.
<br>
- Back to do a few more hours of sage activity
<br>
- Finally I get physically tired, take a shower and go to bed
<br>
<p>So, I sleep about 7 hours, leaving me with 17, so I guess I am using 
<br>
sage for about 12 or 13 hours a day.  Now, I'll admit, I can't do 
<br>
this everyday, since other people are good at breaking me away from 
<br>
it, but this is what I do if no one interrupts me.  Also, I should 
<br>
note that when I was in school, it was mind numbing, so sage got lazy 
<br>
and I only got a couple hours out of it a day (and they certainly 
<br>
weren't devoted to school, but I keep going because I want the 
<br>
general education but I won't get it on my own because I'll learn 
<br>
specific things that I'm really interested in, but I know that 
<br>
general knowledge is very useful).
<br>
<p>Anyway, I doubt I'm the only person in the world who uses sage more 
<br>
often than fidget (at least when it hasn't been numbed by school) and 
<br>
I think we're an important group of people when it comes to sagacity.
