Hey.
<br>
<p>My high school is full of dumbasses, so I couldn't resist putting my two cents in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has anyone considered motivation?  Maybe scientists are smarter because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they value those specific experiences and thus seek out experiences that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make them smarter?   
</em><br>
<p>You're very right. Almost none of my fellow high-schoolers are motivated to learn.
<br>
There is no *need* for them to learn to get an A. Even my &quot;Web Design&quot; teacher
<br>
is little more than cut and paste (and still doesn't know the difference between
<br>
markup and programming). It's very, very depressing to see hundreds of students
<br>
wasting potential and dozens of teachers who are ignorant.
<br>
<p>I guess that when you're in a society where using common sense and acquiring
<br>
knowledge is no longer a basic necessity for survival, you stop using your brain.
<br>
All you really need is enough people to need your service, no matter how
<br>
simplistic.
<br>
<p>That's why my shelf (and I presume yours) are loaded with books. Big fat tomes
<br>
with little entertainment value.
<br>
<p>Or, I could be entirely wrong. I'm writing this under sleep deprivation, so please
<br>
point out any holes.&lt;br clear=all&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at &lt;a href='<a href="http://go.msn.com/bql/hmtag_itl_EN.asp">http://go.msn.com/bql/hmtag_itl_EN.asp</a>'&gt;<a href="http://explorer.msn.com</a">http://explorer.msn.com</a</a>&gt;&lt;br&gt;
