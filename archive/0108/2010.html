<p>Well, we have to make something that does more than optimization, but 
<br>
makes code more intelligent (see below).  This is the brute force 
<br>
method of reaching the Singularity that would take until 2040 as a 
<br>
recent prediction stated.
<br>
<p>Here's an analogy for you.  Back a couple years ago, when Mac icons 
<br>
maxed out at 256 colors per pixel and were 32 *32 pixels in size 
<br>
(1024 pixels^2), this meant that there were 1024^256 (2^2560) 
<br>
possible icons (I'm ignoring small icons and icons with fewer 
<br>
colors).  Now, suppose we had ran a program that created ever icon 
<br>
possible.  Eventually, we get something that looks good.  Better yet, 
<br>
if we have an AI tool that knows what looks good, it could 
<br>
genetically generate icons that looked better and better.  Given 
<br>
enough time, we'd come up with super-looks-.good icons.  Now, this 
<br>
problem space is tiny compared to that of AI, but eventually, with 
<br>
enough processing power, even if we don't have an algorithm to test 
<br>
for intelligence, we'll eventually hit upon the code that works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How would the AI tool know whether it's stumbled upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something intelligent?
</em><br>
<p>Not sure on this right now.  We probably have to have more experience 
<br>
writing intelligent code first.
