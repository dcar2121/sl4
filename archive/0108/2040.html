Hello all.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how long I've been lurking on this list, but I think it's been since the beginning of the year.  I've read every message in the lists' history, with varying degrees of interest and attentiveness, and hope I didn't pick a dead horse to finally ride in on.
<br>
<p>I'm 25, with a degree in History Teaching, currently living in Utah.  I like to know something about everything, which is why I could never regret the major I completed. But if I knew when I started college what I know now I might have tried harder to stick with my original major -- computer science.  I have always been a dabbler in computers, but shied away from learning how to efficiently code in useful languages, probably because of my distaste for mathematics.  Perhaps I'll try again someday.
<br>
<p>The AI route to singularity is something I definitely want to see happen.  The articles by Eliezer at the low beyond website were possibly the most intellectually stimulating documents I've had the fortune to stumble on to.  (I am particularly grateful for having read Eli's autobiography before he decided to remove it.)  I still struggle with the meaning of life, but the FAQ is as good an idea as any I've heard thus far.
<br>
<p>Not being a computer specialist, I will likely continue on this list with mostly passive participation.  The work so many of you are directly engaged in is definitely worth keeping tabs on.
<br>
<p>--Mitch Howe
<br>
<p>(Sorry -- I don't know what it is about this list that attracts people named Mitchell)
