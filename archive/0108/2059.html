</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Issues like these are specifically the whole point of &quot;Creating Friendly
<br>
AI&quot;.  I &quot;get&quot; the Singularity, okay?  I'm sort of proverbial for that. 
<br>
And that full sense of the Singularity, as described in &quot;Staring into the
<br>
Singularity&quot;, true unknowability, is what I had in mind when I wrote
<br>
CFAI.  A Friendly AI is a human-equivalent philosopher.  If the
<br>
post-Singularity world is best handled by a Sysop Scenario and volitional
<br>
Friendliness, then that's what a Friendly AI can do.  If the
<br>
post-Singularity world is totally unknowable in terms of our philosophy
<br>
and we the creators were way off base in imagining what would need to be
<br>
done and why, if our imagining of the future is no better in absolute
<br>
terms then the imaginings of twenty thousand years back, then a Friendly
<br>
AI is supposed to be able to handle that too!
<br>
<p>The post-Singularity world is closed to our vision.  But humans are alive
<br>
here and now.  Humans are not unknowable in the way that transhumans are. 
<br>
So while there's a sense in which we don't know whether the ultimate
<br>
challenge of the Singularity can be successfully faced at all, I can still
<br>
stake and defend the claim that a created mind of a certain type can face
<br>
down that challenge as well as any human.
