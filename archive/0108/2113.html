<em>&gt; James Higgins
</em><br>

</em><br>
What is there to trade?  Information, code, personal services (teaching,
<br>
conversation, security), art, journalism, entertainment, resources
<br>
(computational and real), space, devices (nano and macro) that someone else
<br>
can design and make better or more efficiently.
<br>
<p>And all that is possible long after singularity even if all citizens upload.
<br>
Shortly after singularity and if some citizens remain wetware or merely
<br>
augmented, much more of the current set of markets are likely to survive
<br>
(though seachanged into something rich and strange).
<br>
<p>And I would be very surprised if new markets of goods and services undreamed
<br>
don't emerge.
<br>
<p>I am not  forecasting the survival of the corporate form of business or
<br>
&quot;capitalism as we know it&quot;.  I have no clue as to exactly how finance and
<br>
large scale operations will be conducted.   With large bandwidth networks,
<br>
even barter may become an efficient large scale activity again.   But
<br>
markets are just too handy for coordinating things when multiple people with
<br>
differing abilities, situations and preferences have to interact.  And I
<br>
expext the singularity to make people more different, not more similar.
<br>
<p>Someone (Carl Feynmam?) who posted earlier was exactly right to point out
<br>
that the fear that nanomanufacturing would permanently trash the economy or
<br>
put 95% of people out of work is economically illiterate.  (Major short term
<br>
dislocations are of course likely).  200 years ago more than 95% of people
<br>
in the world worked in agriculture.  In advanced economies that is now less
<br>
than 3% (even less if you only count those who work the land).  A similar
<br>
crash in manufacturing employment has already occurred.   In the US, there
<br>
are not as many manufacturing jobs to lose as have already gone.  Services,
<br>
from software design to sex work, have more than made up for them.  In an
<br>
economy of abundance, the creation of new types of services is endless.  I
<br>
live outside Santa Fe. You would not believe the number of massage
<br>
therapists, personal trainers, aroma therapists, not to mention artists, who
<br>
live in the area.  Why wouldn't the singularity just increase the types of
<br>
services you might want to consume?
