<em>&gt;I think you are totally misunderstanding the Sysop.
</em><br>
<p>My definition of the Sysop would be something like: an entity that will 
<br>
divide up the energy of the solar-system/galaxy/[what have you] evenly among 
<br>
the citizens. When this entity recieves energy from a citizen, the energy is 
<br>
converted to a form asked for by the citizen (information, golf balls, 
<br>
ice-cream, the color of John Sticks underpants, ...) in the optimal way.
<br>
<p>This is my premise for scenario-building. It is not a prediction of What 
<br>
Will Happen.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To provide a wish granting service, ve is going to have to tax you in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computronium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ve will come to you and say 'Hi, if you want me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to grant you wishes, I need some computronium from you so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that I will have to resources to do that'.
</em><br>
<p>He would say: &quot;I need energy from you to convert into the form you desire&quot;. 
<br>
An amount of this energy is needed to design, think, maybe build 
<br>
computronium to think some more etc. So basically I agree with the above 
<br>
statement.
<br>
<p>But my point still holds: You have your share of energy, and you can use it 
<br>
how you like. Everything from getting office furniture to visiting a VR 
<br>
world can be viewed as the spendig of energy. The point is: the best way to 
<br>
convert the energy to a form of you desire is to let the Sysop do it. There 
<br>
is no need whatsoever to have it converted in a less than optimal way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;My guess is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sysop is *only* going to be there as the intelligence of the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of moral enforcement (well, or rights protection or whatever you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like to call it).  Any other tasks will be left up to citizens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Are we debating under different premises? My premise was that the Sysop 
<br>
would be a wish-granter (as I stated above) in the sence that it converts 
<br>
your share of energy in the best possible way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;This will roughly be analogous with the Sysop.  Sure, the Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scales better, but as time goes on and people want bigger, better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wishes, it's going to get insane and we'll see queues filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;backlogged wishes.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. If the rescources/energy is divided evenly among the 
<br>
citizens, the Sysop will devout the same amount of energy to each citizen. 
<br>
If your wish spends more than your share of energy, you will have to settle 
<br>
for something smaller. (By spending I mean the energy is converted to an 
<br>
unusable form like heat). The system wouldn't be overloaded because some of 
<br>
your energy would go to systems that monitors your wishes etc i.e. everyone 
<br>
would use some of their energy to power a piece of Sysop computronium.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, you have your own computronium and grant your own wishes.
</em><br>
<p>I see it as the Sysop using my energy to grant my wish (that is: convert 
<br>
that energy) I could do it myself but that would be less than optimal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sometimes you might need help.  This is where an economy develops
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from.  Grandma might not know how to construct her dream VR, so she
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hires someone else to do it for her (using her resources).
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, her energy is used to construct a dream VR. This can be done 
<br>
optimally by the Sysop or less than optimal by another citizen. Since you 
<br>
would want to do it optimally, no trade would be needed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Also,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some minds might know what they want to do, but simply not have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resources for it.  So, they rent (think distributed computing) or buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the resources of someone else.
</em><br>
<p>What would they use for payment? You can't buy energy/resources with 
<br>
energy/resources.
<br>
However, many people can probably &quot;pool their resources&quot; if they want to 
<br>
build something that requires lots of energy.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for IP laws, it all depends on what turns out to be the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendly thing to do.  My guess is that it is most Friendly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information to be free, but that's just my hunch, I haven't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looked deeply into the issue and don't really plan to in the near
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future.  So, stop worrying about it;
</em><br>
<p>I am certainly not worried about IP-law Post-Singularity, or anything at all 
<br>
Post-Singularity for that matter. My take on the PS world is: All Bets Are 
<br>
Off.
<br>
<p>My worries are that the militant anti-tech movement is going to change its 
<br>
focus from Biotech to AI or that some politician is going to try to shut 
<br>
down SingInst because it is &quot;incompatible with human dignity&quot;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;we're too far away from being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;post Singularity in Sysop Space to say anything useful about what IP
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'laws' will be like then.
</em><br>
<p>Or say anything useful about the PS world at all. Speculating can be fun 
<br>
though...
