<p>
Concerning the question of trade post-singularity, Christian L. scoffed as
<br>
follows:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What kind of information/code can you not get from the Sysop?
</em><br>
<p>1) Any information/code protected by intellectual property rules
<br>
2) Any information/code created directly for you as the basis of a trade
<br>
3) Any information/code the Sysop decides for whatever reason it doen't want
<br>
to give you.  Maybe it will think that self-reliance builds character.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Wouldn't the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop be the best journalist or provide the best entertainment/art?
</em><br>
<p>1) If you think only the best journalist or artist is worth your regard, our
<br>
points of view are so dissimilar I doubt the rest of this conversation will
<br>
help.  Most people like a variety of perspectives, and develop personal
<br>
attachments to particular writers, journalists and artists.
<br>
2) I assume the Sysop will be a special purpose AI who does not fill all the
<br>
roles of a general AI citizen, for the same reason judges are not advocates,
<br>
and high goverment officials are not concurrently in business (except for
<br>
corrupt regimes like our current administration), the conflict of interest
<br>
between the various roles would degrade the Sysop's ability to fulfill its
<br>
primary functions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a human made a great painting, you could always tell the Sysop to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicate one for you.
</em><br>
<p>For free?  No royalties?  You could also tell it to steal it.  The question
<br>
is whether it would do what you ask.  (Napster has a lot to answer for!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security? The primary goal of the Sysop is security. What use would a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bodyguard have if no one can harm you?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;1) The Sysop will certainly provide basic security services to prevent
<br>
major harms.  Whether it will provide all possible security services, and
<br>
whether it will agree with you as to what constitutes a harm are separate
<br>
questions.  People hire nontech security now not only to backstop the
<br>
police, but also to do things the police won't, like put their bodies
<br>
inbetween papparazi cameras and famous faces.
<br>
2) Conspicuous consumption.  (Or do you think that come the revolution we
<br>
will outlaw conspicuous consumption?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you want to learn something, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be the best teacher? A human or a Superintelligence?
</em><br>
<p>This may be the heart of our disagreement.  I envisage a future with many
<br>
&quot;Superintelligences&quot;, an entire ecology, not just us humans and single
<br>
parent Sysop.  I assume specialization will triumph over one omnicompetent
<br>
supercitizen.  Perhaps we could design a world where each person only
<br>
interacted with the Sysop, who recreated an entire artificial world for each
<br>
of us designed to make us happy, but do we want to?  I think one part of
<br>
Eli's design of friendliness, with an accent on preserving citizen autonomy,
<br>
is to design an AI that would reject that type of Sysop role.  I expect the
<br>
Sysop, and friendly major powers generally, to leave to lesser powers and
<br>
humans (which may become lesser powers eventually for all we know) those
<br>
tasks that they can handle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And frankly, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are so extremely shy that you need to PAY people to talk to you, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop kan kindly ask your permission to rewire some basic social skills
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Considering the billions people currently pay for conversation and
<br>
associated activities, from therapy and sexwork to bars and bowling leagues,
<br>
I suspect that your vision of the future is not that everyone develops
<br>
social skills, but that everyone gives up on them and just lives in a
<br>
solopsistic world with the Sysop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who would pay for a device constructed by a (trans)human when he can get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superior device for free?
</em><br>
<p>You really don't believe in the Prophet Heinlein and the holy word of
<br>
TANSTAAFL, do you?  Again, even if nanomanufacturing is effectively free,
<br>
and I expect that will only be true if you keep your desires small, design
<br>
work will be free only if the Sysop is Santa Claus.  Otherwise, some designs
<br>
will be free and some won't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What do you mean by trading space? How many cubic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light-years do you need? For what?
</em><br>
<p>I just need a location close to my friends and far away from people who are
<br>
rude or aggravating.  Funny how that always seems to cost something.  And if
<br>
you think some people will not try to grab prime real estate, such as the
<br>
sphere around any star out to the orbit of the third or fourth planet, you
<br>
have never met a real estate developer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why would there be a shortage of space?
</em><br>
<p>Why are land values high in Los Vegas, when there is empty desert all around
<br>
it?  Why do people pay for domain names, when there are so many unclaimed?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only truly valuable thing post-singularity is probably only matter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy, or only energy if you consider E=mc^2,
</em><br>
<p>I cannot think of any prediction about life after the Singularity that is
<br>
less likely to be true.  (Again, assuming that we do not all merge into a
<br>
single hive mind.)  Here's hoping we are both around to see who was right.
<br>
