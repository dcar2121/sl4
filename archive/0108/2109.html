<em>&gt;Perhaps we can think about it as a legal system. We all agree to obey

</em><br>
<em>&gt;volition of, say, murderers and adults who want to have sex with

<em>&gt;members of PETA. It allows abortions which really annoys the Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Right. It prevents you from growing certain natural plants and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smoking them.
</em><br>
<p>The thing with current systems is that if they don't work, you can 
<br>
remove/change/overthrow them.  In fact, the founding fathers of the US 
<br>
tried to ensure that the citizens would always have the ability to 
<br>
overthrow their own government if it became tyrannical.  If nothing else, 
<br>
you can leave as there are many countries all with their own 
<br>
governments.  So you get to pick and choose.  If the one you are in goes to 
<br>
hell, you can move.
<br>
<p>There will be no choice in the Sysop's realm.  And if things go bad (this 
<br>
is always a possibility, no matter how small) everyone is stuck and thus 
<br>
possibly screwed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In a VR enhanced society with Friendliness, we can live
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out our fantasies, whatever they are, in complete safety with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to other sentient beings. A lowest level prevention mechanism of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical operating system would prevent one sentient from actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harming another.
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly.
<br>
<p>Acting out your fantasies might be incredibly difficult.  According to the 
<br>
suggested rules you can't simulate people in VR.  If they are a &quot;real&quot; 
<br>
person you are simulating, acting out your fantasies with a simulation of 
<br>
them is deemed to violate them.  Second, if you create a simulation of a 
<br>
person it becomes a citizen, permanently get assigned the computing 
<br>
resources you allocated to it and gets its own full volition.  Thus you 
<br>
can't simulate anything.
<br>
<p>Which means if you want to act out your fantasies, your going to need other 
<br>
&quot;real&quot; people to cooperate.  This has all sorts of problems.  First, the 
<br>
way it sounds is that the sysop warns you not to read any incoming messages 
<br>
from people you don't trust.  So it will be very hard to meet new 
<br>
people.  Second, any &quot;VR&quot; type setting better be a private setting.  If you 
<br>
wanted to go to the mall in VR, for example, you would need hundreds or 
<br>
more individuals to play along.  Try getting an individual to play at being 
<br>
a sales clerk, chef, waiter, butler, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This &quot;prevention&quot; though, is a form of &quot;control&quot;. There seems no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around it. It is the *feeling* of being under another's control that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is bitterly rejected. Perhaps one way out of the contradiction is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;voluntarily live in a make believe world where we &quot;think&quot; we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complete free will and then periodically are &quot;revived&quot;, reminded
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that we, ourselves, set ourselves up to believe this fake reality for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our own peace of mind and are given the choice of continuing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simulation or not.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, its more about sealing the human race into a logical cell with no 
<br>
way of escape in an emergency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Would you be willing to take &quot;The Illusion of Freedom with Periodic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Resuscitation&quot; as a compromise? ;-) If not you could always stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on old Earth OR try to travel faster than the galactically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spreading Sysop...you'll have those real choices at least. The other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way is to deactive your &quot;need&quot; to feel free of the Operating System,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but for some reason, I don't think you'd want to do that.
</em><br>
<p>I'd take the &quot;try to travel faster than the galactically spreading sysop&quot; 
<br>
option (for at least 1 copy of myself), but I don't think the powers that 
<br>
be on this list want to even offer that option to anyone.
