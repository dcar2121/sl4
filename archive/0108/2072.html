<p>No.  Quite simply, if someone can get outside the Sysop, they could 
<br>
hose the Universe.  Alice could say 'Sysop, let me out' and then the 
<br>
Sysop lets her out.  Then she proceeds to release grey goo on the 
<br>
Universe and kill us all.  It's all or nothing, as I think Eliezer 
<br>
wrote a few posts ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Further, why couldn't individuals come and go from the Sysop's 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you want to go somewhere, that's fine, but you are still going to 
<br>
be under Sysop control.  The Sysop is not just one process, but many 
<br>
processes running in every bit of conputronium (this may not be how 
<br>
it's actually implemented, but I think you get the idea that the 
<br>
Sysop just is and is everywhere).  So, you can go to Alpha Centarui, 
<br>
it's just you're still not going to be able to violate the volition 
<br>
of anyone else.
<br>
<p>Actually, this brings up an interesting issue:  what are the default 
<br>
permissions for interacting with alien (viz. outside Sysop Space) 
<br>
minds?  I would think something like mode 700 to be safe (okay, so 
<br>
only the other byte would have any meaning for an alien, but I had to 
<br>
have an easy way to write it) and make adjustments per the alien's 
<br>
requests.  Also, I think this calls for an extra byte (an alien 
<br>
byte).  Oh, but if the Sysop arise from the AI, a mind in general, it 
<br>
is probably the natural outcome of any Singularity attempt (at least 
<br>
where Friendliness was implemented, because if it wasn't then we had 
<br>
better get to the Singularity fast so we can figure out to stop the 
<br>
hosing before it gets us).
<br>
<p>Hmm, I think I'm going to come up with formal modes for use in Sysop 
<br>
Space rather than saying 'something like Unix mode xxx'.  I'll get 
<br>
back to the list on this one shortly ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;So, what are your thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>I don't see all your concerns about not being able to get it right as 
<br>
a problem.  Basically, here is what the Sysop is going to do before 
<br>
we upload anyone or move any AIs onto computronium (so maybe this is 
<br>
actually what the Transition Guide might do):
<br>
<p>- Develop a design for the Sysop (based on what I've written, what 
<br>
Eli's written, what's on this list, and anything else interesting 
<br>
that will surely come along).
<br>
<p>- Refine the design using the coding heuristics (vis codic cortex?) 
<br>
ve has developed.
<br>
<p>- Develop a system (whatever it may actually be, probably something 
<br>
like the Sysop, or maybe you might call it Unix for the Singularity).
<br>
<p>- Stress test it in simulation (yes, this will be the same as the 
<br>
real thing, the AI should have the ability to do this).
<br>
<p>- After full stress testing, put a few (viz. millions of) copies of 
<br>
Friendly AIs on it and have them try it out.  Have them all try to 
<br>
violation volition at once.  Really test the thing out and see what 
<br>
happens.  Since they're Friendly AIs, they won't actually do anything 
<br>
un Friendly, just pretend to (in a way that the Sysop can't tell the 
<br>
difference from a real attempt).
<br>
<p>- Finally, begin transitioning in minds.  First, bring in the 
<br>
(Friendly) AIs.  Then, bring in known altruists (e.g. Eliezer).  Then 
<br>
bring in suspected altruists.  Then bring in the rest.  All along the 
<br>
way, making sure that the system keeps working.  The Friendliest ones 
<br>
are put in first in case something goes wrong they won't hose the 
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p><p>If after all that there are still bugs, they probably won't be 
<br>
catastrophic (if they are we're hosed, but we are if we don't have 
<br>
the Sysop anyway).  Actually, I should note that we may not be hosed 
<br>
for sure, it's just that we most likely will be.
<br>
<p>Hmm, this post gives me some good ideas, so I'm going to have to go 
<br>
work on them.
<br>
<p>Oh, finally, why we're at it, Eli mentioned wishing he'd named the 
<br>
Sysop Scenario the Unix Scenario if only he'd been more PRish when he 
<br>
came up with it.  Well, I'd say only a handful of us have ever even 
<br>
really thought about the Sysop Scenario, so now would be a good time 
<br>
to change the name.  It would probably be better not to write about a 
<br>
sysop anyway, since there may not actually be any mind called the 
<br>
Sysop (after all, it takes extra cycles for the AI to be able to use 
<br>
the word 'I', for which there is no good reason for the Sysop to do 
<br>
so, IMO), just a very intelligent system that protects the universe 
<br>
from violation of volition and being toasted.
<br>
<p>So, we have two proposals at the moment:  Sysop and Unix.  Any 
<br>
others?  My only concern with Unix is that we don't want to associate 
<br>
what is actually going to happen too much with Unix, but then at the 
<br>
moment is people thinking too much of a Sysop as a god controlling 
<br>
their lives and refusing to let them live free (as if they get to 
<br>
live free now ...).
