</em><br>
<p>I think you are totally misunderstanding the Sysop.
<br>
<p>To provide a wish granting service, ve is going to have to tax you in 
<br>
computronium.  Ve will come to you and say 'Hi, if you want me to 
<br>
continue to grant you wishes, I need some computronium from you so 
<br>
that I will have to resources to do that'.  My guess is that the 
<br>
Sysop is *only* going to be there as the intelligence of the system 
<br>
of moral enforcement (well, or rights protection or whatever you'd 
<br>
like to call it).  Any other tasks will be left up to citizens.
<br>
<p>This is a simple matter of resources.  A good example of where this 
<br>
exists today is health care.  In the US, despite HMOs and such, 
<br>
health care is pretty much a private thing.  Most of the time people 
<br>
can take care of themselves (colds, flus, etc.) and only seek the 
<br>
help of a Power (the doctor) when they are really sick.  Now, think 
<br>
about health care in Canada.  You pay x taxes to give the health care 
<br>
system the resources it needs to function.  Then, when you are sick, 
<br>
the system is supposed to help you out.  Alas, it doesn't quite work 
<br>
like this.  They simply can't charge enough taxes to take care of 
<br>
everyone; it's an infrastructure problem.  Only so many requests can 
<br>
be processed at a time, no matter how much money the system has. 
<br>
This will roughly be analogous with the Sysop.  Sure, the Sysop 
<br>
scales better, but as time goes on and people want bigger, better 
<br>
wishes, it's going to get insane and we'll see queues filled with 
<br>
backlogged wishes.
<br>
<p>So, you have your own computronium and grant your own wishes. 
<br>
Sometimes you might need help.  This is where an economy develops 
<br>
from.  Grandma might not know how to construct her dream VR, so she 
<br>
hires someone else to do it for her (using her resources).  Also, 
<br>
some minds might know what they want to do, but simply not have the 
<br>
resources for it.  So, they rent (think distributed computing) or buy 
<br>
the resources of someone else.
<br>
<p>As for IP laws, it all depends on what turns out to be the most 
<br>
Friendly thing to do.  My guess is that it is most Friendly for 
<br>
information to be free, but that's just my hunch, I haven't really 
<br>
looked deeply into the issue and don't really plan to in the near 
<br>
future.  So, stop worrying about it; we're too far away from being 
<br>
post Singularity in Sysop Space to say anything useful about what IP 
<br>
'laws' will be like then.
