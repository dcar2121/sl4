&nbsp;&nbsp;My own best
<br>
<em>&gt; theory as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why a number of famous people who admit that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics would work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; e.g. Issac Asimov, never bothered to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves frozen, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that they had begun to live for their fame.  
</em><br>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting the Good Doctor while
<br>
I was in college in New York, and perhaps can give
<br>
you some insight into his personality.  Despite
<br>
being a science fiction author (and an author on
<br>
just about every other subject), Asimov was still
<br>
very much a product of his early 20th century
<br>
Russian Jewish immigrant upbringing.  He was somewhat
<br>
of a technophobe, as evidenced by his fear of flying
<br>
and use of an electric typewriter when many people
<br>
had converted to PCs.
<br>
<p>My guess is that the creators of these ideas, like
<br>
Asimov, often don't internalize them, because they
<br>
didn't grow up with them.  Another aspect is that
<br>
Asimov by inclination and training was a 'scientist'.
<br>
That meant being an observer, not a participant.
<br>
<p>As far as fame-seeking activities, my understanding
<br>
of human personalities is that there are about 15
<br>
factors in the human personality that appear with
<br>
varying strength in each person.  Several of them
<br>
can be satisfied by being famous (the desires for
<br>
status, money, and sex being among them).  Only if
<br>
a person doesn't exhibit any of these factors do
<br>
we need to resort to other explanations for fame-
<br>
seeking.
