<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) Should an SI spend time looking for other hidden AI's as soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         as possible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) Should an SI spend time looking for ET?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3) Should an SI spend time trying to determine if it is already
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course only an SI should decide these things, but we as humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already pour resources into #2. Maybe the DOD spends money on #1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And #3...well, that's deliciously undetectable isn't it ;-)
</em><br>
<p>All of the above?  If it is truly an &quot;SI&quot;, then these tasks should be 
<br>
trivial for it (at least when comparing its ability to ours).  It should be 
<br>
able to spot #1 easily, since it is an SI looking for AIs.  If there has 
<br>
been contact, #2 should be simple since it should be easy an SI to get the 
<br>
real truth out of any human.  If there has not been any contact, #2 would 
<br>
be incredibly difficult if they didn't want to be found since they are 
<br>
likely to either be or have SIs themselves.  The last one could be a piece 
<br>
of cake for an SI, or maybe not.  Heck if #3 is true, creating an SI either 
<br>
may not be possible at all or it may halt the simulation (god, I hope that 
<br>
isn't it).  Or the goal of the simulation may have been to produce an 
<br>
SI!  Do  yourself a favor, don't get me started on #3.
