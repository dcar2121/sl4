<em>&gt;Brian, those are interesting and important points. I've forwarded your post

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is there a consensus on this list that the Singularity is good and should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accelerated?
</em><br>
<p>My opinion:
<br>
<p>Q: Is the Singularity good?
<br>
<p>A: Yes, I think.
<br>
<p>There is a small chance that it may turn out not to be, but that would be 
<br>
impossible to even fathom unless you had already transcended.  My basic 
<br>
thought on that is, if we achieve ultimate knowledge, eternal life and can 
<br>
essentially have anything we want when and how we want it, is there any 
<br>
point?  In other words, if we achieve all our goals in what would be an 
<br>
instant on our time frame, what comes afterwards?
<br>
<p>Maybe post-Singularity is heaven.  We know all, everything is peaceful, and 
<br>
it is eternal.  Forgive the analogy, but I've actually been comparing 
<br>
various aspects of the Singularity to religion (I'm not religious, but find 
<br>
some of the similarities quite intriguing).  Only problem is, I've often 
<br>
wondered if Heaven would be boring.
<br>
<p>Q: Should the Singularity be accelerated?
<br>
<p>A: Sooner is better than later, but please not tomorrow.
<br>
<p>More specifically, I realize that life post-Singularity will be very, very 
<br>
different.  There are things I would very much like to do/experience before 
<br>
the Singularity arrives.  The &quot;ideal&quot; scenario IMHO would be if the 
<br>
Singularity was widely announced at being exactly 1 year away and everyone 
<br>
had the chance to enjoy themselves until that point (ie: year long 
<br>
vacation).  Unfortunatley, I'm very much aware that this is impossible on 
<br>
many levels.  So while I would much prefer to see it soon, I wouldn't want 
<br>
it to arrive this year.  Yes, I also realize that this is somewhat selfish 
<br>
of myself since people die every day.  I could also die before the 
<br>
Singularity arrives.  Yet, I imagine, there are things most people would 
<br>
want to do before it arrived if they only knew.
