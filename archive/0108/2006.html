<p>
The distinction between a dumbass and an AI researcher consists of both
<br>
intrinsic smartness and education.  From the tenor of the rest of your
<br>
message, I assume you're interested in the intrinsic smartness part of the
<br>
distinction.  Psychologists like to reify 'smartness' by something called
<br>
the 'g factor', which is supposed to differ between people.  IQ tests
<br>
measure the g factor, and the amount of g factor is commonly called IQ.
<br>
Here's a semi-popular article on the topic, most of which I agree with:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sciam.com/1998/1198intelligence/1198gottfred.html">http://www.sciam.com/1998/1198intelligence/1198gottfred.html</a>
<br>
<p>The higher the g factor, the better a person is at all kinds of mental
<br>
functioning, including 'non-reasoning' tests like response time and accurate
<br>
perception of small stimuli.
<br>
<p>Here's a quote from the article:
<br>
<p>Moreover, research on the physiology and genetics of g has uncovered
<br>
biological correlates of this psychological phenomenon. In the past decade,
<br>
studies by teams of researchers in North America and Europe have linked
<br>
several attributes of the brain to general intelligence. After taking into
<br>
account gender and physical stature, brain size as determined by magnetic
<br>
resonance imaging is moderately correlated with IQ (about 0.4 on a scale of
<br>
0 to 1). So is the speed of nerve conduction. The brains of bright people
<br>
also use less energy during problem solving than do those of their less able
<br>
peers. And various qualities of brain waves correlate strongly (about 0.5 to
<br>
0.7) with IQ: the brain waves of individuals with higher IQs, for example,
<br>
respond more promptly and consistently to simple sensory stimuli such as
<br>
audible clicks.
<br>
<p>&lt;End quote&gt;
<br>
<p>I want to respond to an unspoken assumption that some posters to this list
<br>
have been making: that a person with an IQ of 50 is &quot;half as smart&quot; as a
<br>
person with an IQ of 100.  This is an unwarranted assumption.  An adult with
<br>
an IQ of 50 can walk around without hitting things, ride a bike around town,
<br>
interpret facial expressions, use and understand more than a thousand words,
<br>
and use and recognize hundreds of ordinary objects.  All these tasks, in
<br>
aggregate, use far more of the brain than the kind of abstract reasoning it
<br>
takes to do AI research.  The difference is that takes a person with an IQ
<br>
of 50 much longer to learn these things than it does someone with an IQ of
<br>
100, and they never get as good as it.  So I think a person with an IQ of 50
<br>
is something like 90% as smart as a person with an IQ of 100.  (It could be
<br>
80% or 99%-- this is assigning a precise number to an imprecise concept.)
