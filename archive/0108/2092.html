</em><br>
<p>The Sysop is needed, Unix Reality is just a clarification of how the 
<br>
system will likely work.  After all, most of the time the Sysop 
<br>
probably won't need to do anything intelligent to tell Alice she 
<br>
can't kill Bob and the like.  But, I agree with you, there is a need 
<br>
to talk about the Sysop, it's just that since the Sysop won't be 
<br>
responsible for a lot of the infrastructure (at least under the model 
<br>
I'm currently proposing) the two should be separated to avoid 
<br>
confusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Using protection of volition as the moral underpinning of the sysops
</em><br>
<em>&gt;activity is fair enough, so long as it is understood as a gesture in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general direction, rather than anything more specific.  Both Kant and Mill
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be understood as using protection of volition as the foundation of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moral theories, but they differ on many issues.  (Even Ayn Rand might be put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in that group, if one thought her writings were rational, moral, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;philosophical.  I don't, but some here do, and agreements on practical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issues among these three will not be all that plentiful.)  Gordon Worley's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attempt to diffuse situations where volitions conflict by using an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;active/passive distinction (doesn't that capture the &quot;doing/done to&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;language?) does as well as most attempts: it solves some but not nearly all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situations (at the cost of changing a protection of volition theory to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protection of justifiable volition theory where the &quot;justifiable&quot; does much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the work).  But hey, if thinking through morality were that easy, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have one less reason for developing more than human intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>What kinds of situations does it not cover?  It seems pretty good to 
<br>
me, but then maybe we have a different outlook on this.  I've gone to 
<br>
looking at it like this:  not being made to do something you don't 
<br>
want to is a right, being able to do what you want is a privilege. 
<br>
If what you want to do is wrong qua non violation of volition, then 
<br>
you can't do it.  Basically, by making the moral non violation of 
<br>
volition rather than protection of volition I free myself from having 
<br>
to worry about conflicts.  That's why I'm always careful to write 
<br>
'non violation of volition'.
<br>
<p>Oh, just thinking of this, a rather sticky situation:
<br>
<p>Alice and Bob are put in execution seats (I don't care how, but the 
<br>
seats can kill them).  Both have a button that will kill the other 
<br>
and let the pusher go free.  If, after 20 minutes, neither button has 
<br>
been pushed, both will die.  What does the Sysop do?  If we're lucky, 
<br>
Bob says he'll die, so the Sysop let's Alice kill him.  But, if 
<br>
neither wants to die, what to do?  But, then again, the Sysop would 
<br>
keep such a situation from arising to begin with.  But, assuming no 
<br>
Sysop, just that non violation of volition is The Moral of the 
<br>
universe and someone violated it to put Bob and Alice in this 
<br>
position (or tricked them)?  Maybe both push the buttons at the same 
<br>
time and try to short the system out?
<br>
<p>Or, maybe the solution is 'all the more reason for backups'.  :-)
