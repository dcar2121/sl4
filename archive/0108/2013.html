CRACKING
<br>
--------
<br>
<p>CORRECTION (to my previous post):
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All we have is tactical battlefield analysis and SecureCYC, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds like an auotmated AI hacking program (or was it CYCSecure?)
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I was thinking &quot;cracking&quot; and typed &quot;hacking&quot;. I meant it sounds
<br>
like a system designed to break into other networks, perhaps a scaled
<br>
down version of a serious &quot;cracking&quot; program that is being used to turn 
<br>
a profit. If you know common sense and have a vague idea of human
<br>
psychology, brute force might not be necessary. Guessing birthdays?
<br>
Mathematicians like certain numbers. Trying &quot;Gandalf&quot;.
<br>
<p>Someone told me that Poland had cracked an early version of the Enigma 
<br>
with an Enigma machine (replica?) and transmissions from the current 
<br>
day and the day before. Then they worked on a simple assumption that
<br>
the operator turned the rotors only once because that was the easiest
<br>
thing to do. Could be folklore. Anyone else heard this before?
<br>
<p>I'd still like to know if CYC succeeds as a common sense reasoning
<br>
engine...
<br>
<p><p>PARASITIC AI
<br>
------------
<br>
<p>Here's a puzzle: Could we (anyone the outside) determine if CYC has
<br>
succeeded in the following two cases:
<br>
<p>1) CYC works as its creators had hoped, but *applying* CYC properly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is incredibly difficult. RESULT: looks like it fails.
<br>
<p>2) CYC works as its creators had hoped, but they don't want anyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to know, so they present a disabled version to the public. RESULT:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looks like it fails.
<br>
<p><p>This conundrum of being on the outside and trying to determine 
<br>
&quot;success&quot; applies to any other AI project, like WebMind's or
<br>
SingInst's. 
<br>
<p>Here's one illegal way to finance WebMind. From what I've heard,
<br>
the financial community uses neural nets to look for abberations
<br>
in trading to catch illegal activities. One might hire an expert
<br>
in this field and use something like the financial-savvy WebMind1.0
<br>
to try to manipulate stocks outside the tolerance of detection.
<br>
<p>Obviously this risks far too much for someone like Ben G. who 
<br>
might (ought to!) be able to finance his project legitamately.
<br>
For the record, I'll state that I think he's too smart to do 
<br>
something as silly and risky as that.
<br>
<p>But it does raise the interesting specter of non-detectability.
<br>
Let's suppose someone unknown to all of us beats Ben and Eli to 
<br>
the punch and develops and AI first. A young AI leans to siphon
<br>
money from the world's monetary systems undetectably. Early on
<br>
this system might make mistakes, but, ever-paranoid, gets better
<br>
and better at it so that even a naive AI wouldn't be able to
<br>
detect ver.
<br>
<p>This parasitic AI just siphons off a small enough amount of money
<br>
to support it's creators on a private island populated with visiting
<br>
super models and exotic albino flamingos (they just like albino
<br>
flamingos, ok?). Also this PAI slowly and increasingly non-detectably
<br>
looks for all the hardware overhang (think all the idle PC's in
<br>
the world), every increasing its bases, er, I mean resources.
<br>
<p>Now Let's say that either Eli or BenG or Peter create an AI that
<br>
starts exploring the world on the web. Our Loki-esque PAI is on
<br>
the look out for any new AI that might come along and spoil its
<br>
secret domination and is sitting ready and waiting to confuse and
<br>
mislead the new AI? It's goal might be to secure its position by
<br>
secretly preventing any new AI from bringing the world to singularity 
<br>
by stalling nascent AI's. 
<br>
<p><p><p>Ok, it's time to ask if this scenario is more than a bad Sci-Fi
<br>
plot. I think it relates to a class of problems such as:
<br>
<p>1) Should an SI spend time looking for other hidden AI's as soon
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as possible?
<br>
2) Should an SI spend time looking for ET?
<br>
3) Should an SI spend time trying to determine if it is already
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a simulation?
<br>
<p>Of course only an SI should decide these things, but we as humans
<br>
already pour resources into #2. Maybe the DOD spends money on #1.
<br>
And #3...well, that's deliciously undetectable isn't it ;-)
