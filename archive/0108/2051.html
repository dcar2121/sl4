</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is what extensive thought on the matter leads me to believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Based on this belief, the best course may be to hold off on launching an AI
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect that we will have Real AI and most likely SI before that comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pass, thus my belief that if SIs aren't inherently friendly we are probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doomed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>One thing SIAI is trying to do is make something of a science out of
<br>
Friendliness. It may be impossible, but we're trying. Here we have a
<br>
large difference of opinion between us and James on what would be the
<br>
optimum path to take due more or less to this one issue of Friendliness.
<br>
But so far James seems to be going on mostly a &quot;gut feel&quot; that Friendly
<br>
AI is not doable with a large degree of certainty. Do you have any specific
<br>
criticisms of FAI James that we could try to discuss? I can tell from
<br>
your other posts that your main concern is apparently a combo of &quot;will it
<br>
work long term&quot; and &quot;can we be 100% certain&quot;, right? It seems like your
<br>
concern is addressed in the CFAI FAQ:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/info/indexfaq.html#q_2.10">http://www.intelligence.org/CFAI/info/indexfaq.html#q_2.10</a>
<br>
<p>I have a hard time seeing how a human-level Gandhi-ish AI will suddenly run
<br>
amok as it gets smarter, except due to some technical glitch (which is a
<br>
separate issue we can talk about if you want).
<br>
<p>Also, can you address this quote from Q3.3 in the FAQ, since it relates
<br>
to your suggestion the ideal path would be to wait:
<br>
<p>&quot;Nothing in this world is perfectly safe.  The question is how to minimize
<br>
&nbsp;risk.  As best as we can figure it, trying really hard to develop Friendly
<br>
&nbsp;AI is safer than any alternate strategy, including not trying to develop
<br>
&nbsp;Friendly AI, or waiting to develop Friendly AI, or trying to develop some
<br>
&nbsp;other technology first.  That's why the Singularity Institute exists.&quot;
