No one ever thought the same as Eli, you seem to feed some kind of confusion
<br>
between classical AI and FAI =)
<br>
Discussion is closed, fine by me. I wanted you to feel how annoying it is
<br>
when someone quotes you out of context which you repeatedly did with Brian.
<br>
It was not my intention to insult you. *sincere apologies*
<br>
&nbsp;Take care =)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The whole point is to do the talking before and get it 'right'. &quot;then we

can
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;talk&quot; is a pipe dream if whoever creates the 1st Real AI gets it wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which is likely to happen as long as ppl have the attitude that you do

have
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;about it. I can understand that you are not conviced. What I cannot grasp

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Just saying it won't happen for whatever reason is sweet but that's all

it
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is =)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The context here was talking about time lines for AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development.  Certainly many people have ideas on how to develop Real AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but they are different and some/many of them may not work.  And thus,
</em><br>
while
<br>
<em>&gt; we can estimate how much time any of them may take, we can not estimate
</em><br>
how
<br>
<em>&gt; long it will take until we have the first running Real AI.  This
</em><br>
discussion
<br>
<em>&gt; has been concluded and I do not wish to reopen it, I state this here for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clarification only.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The fact is that no one knows what Real AI is going to require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*cough*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Did you really read FAI ? Did you read all of the material on Low Beyond
</em><br>
?
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Did you read the SL4 archives ? If you did (****and understood it****)
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;still believe the sentence above, well... either nothing will ever
</em><br>
convince
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you or your understanding of intelligence is quite different from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;understanding most people have of it on this list. Should it be the 2nd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;case, please enlighten us =)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you or anyone else guarantee me 100% that Eli's plans for Real AI will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work?  Simply implement his design and bingo we have Real AI?  Sounds
</em><br>
nice,
<br>
<em>&gt; but others have thought the same but did not succeed.  I'm not saying he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't succeed, I'm just saying it would be irresponsible to hang our hopes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on any one (or even several) possible solutions since all solutions to
</em><br>
date
<br>
<em>&gt; have failed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;.  As for destructive technologies, nothing.  My personal belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is that either super intelligence will promote friendliness or we're
</em><br>
doomed.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;We are doomed already. SIAI is the exit as far as certain persons are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;concerned.  =)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that we are most likely doomed if we don't develop an SI, or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least a very smart AI that can help us develop FTL travel, space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colonization, etc.  Just some of the reasons I support SI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development.  However, I still feel that if SIs are not inherently
</em><br>
friendly
<br>
<em>&gt; (to at least a reasonable degree) then we are probably doomed anyway.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You really didn't read my posts, did you?  I NEVER SAID, ANYWHERE that
</em><br>
RNIs
<br>
<em>&gt; were going to be faster, cheaper, better, or any such thing.  I was
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an unsupportable argument!  There is not enough fact known about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exact development of either in order to create a realistic future time
</em><br>
line.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I take that as a serious insult, by the way.  Calling someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closed-minded is very rude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Given a fully functioning General AI, the availability of strong
</em><br>
nanotech,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and that this AI has access to nanotech (I find this VERY unlikely), then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;yes.  But what fool is going to give a seed AI access to nanotech?  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;this still requires a functioning General AI that we still have no idea
</em><br>
how
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to build.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The same type of fool that believe that fully intelligent (same level as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;FAI, self optimizing, etc....) RNIs will be here before SIAI or that RNIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are more/less advanced. They are both far away, with pros and cons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Which fruit is more a fruit than the other one ? The orange or the pear ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;None, they both are fruits, period.

on

over

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, I'm done replying to your posts.  If your not going to bother reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my posts thoroughly enough to make intelligent replies, but instead just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reply to insult me what is the point.  The only thing your doing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lowering the quality of this list with pointless bantering tripe in order
