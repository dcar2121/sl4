<p><p>I agree completely.  I think that there are many people who effectively use
<br>
Sage more often than not, and that some of these even manage to have very
<br>
high level thought for much of this.  These are the people who generally
<br>
stand out as being productive, useful, significant, etc.  I have noticed a
<br>
trend whenever the daily schedule of some powerful businessperson or
<br>
politician is outlined:  there is always a great amount of variety.  The
<br>
length of the work day may vary (think George W. Bush vs. Bill Clinton) but
<br>
said work day is still broken up into small, potent sessions of high-level
<br>
thought.  I think Sage makes a much better decathalete than marathon runner.
<br>
Like the typical day you outlined, you are able to do many tasks requiring
<br>
high level thought, but can't linger too long on any specific one.  It is an
<br>
effective workaround to human mental fatigue.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, we shouldn't have to worry about Sage fatigue in an AI -- if it
<br>
turns out that we do it should prove to be a very interesting topic of
<br>
study.
<br>
<p>For that matter, does anyone have a short answer or theory as to why humans
<br>
have difficulty with sustained high level thought in the first place?
