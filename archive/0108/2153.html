<p>My point is that it is perfectly possible to operate in the absence of
<br>
experimental support or definite proof.  It is simply more dangerous.  If
<br>
you're casting around for something that makes a good grant proposal and
<br>
is easy to defend in front of a committee, you can afford to stay in
<br>
territory that is mostly but not completely known.  When I need to know
<br>
something, I need to know it right away, whether or not neurology has
<br>
caught up with me yet, and I can't just go investigate something else
<br>
instead.
<br>
<p>In this case, whether fame is an independent drive is important mostly to
<br>
internal rationality and not to AI-related matters.  But if it was
<br>
important to AI-related matters, and neurology hadn't come up with a
<br>
definite answer yet, then I would have to make my best guess based on
<br>
prior knowledge.  There's nothing unscientific about that.  The rules
<br>
don't say that you aren't allowed to guess, or that guesses are
<br>
worthless.  The rules just say that guesses have to be based on what you
<br>
do know, and that the guess must yield to experimental evidence when the
<br>
evidence becomes available.
