</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, what's to say that the AI can create a ~trans-human~ AI? Isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a leap of faith?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I think we are having problems with the terms &quot;smart&quot; and
<br>
&quot;intelligence.&quot; To me, these terms are at best a sort of aggregate
<br>
measure for a broad class of loosely-coorelated capabilities. The only 
<br>
capability of interest for bootstrapping is technical creativity.
<br>
If we can create an entity with this quality such that the quality's
<br>
implementation has a heavy technical component, then we should be able
<br>
to bootstrap. The obvious instance of such an entity would be an AI. We
<br>
&quot;merely&quot; need the AI to be sufficiently technically creative to enhance
<br>
it's own technical creativity. If, for example, Elizier builds the AI,
<br>
then the AI need not be as &quot;smart&quot; as Elizier. It merely needs to be as
<br>
technically creative as Elizier. In fact, it may not even need to be
<br>
that good. It merely needs to be good enough to start improving itself.
<br>
In my experience, creating a system from scratch is takes a lot more
<br>
creativity than improving that system. Now it may need an Elizier to
<br>
dream up new and qualitatively different subsystems to add to the.
<br>
system. However, I'm hoping that we will eventually be able to use
<br>
the AI as an &quot;Elizier multiplier.&quot; Elizier specifies an architecture,
<br>
and perhaps even does a crude prototype, and the AI then refines and
<br>
optimizes the result. In this case, Elizier plus the AI form a system
<br>
whose technical creativity has a major technical component, and the
<br>
bootstrap accelerates.
