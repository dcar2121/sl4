<p>Well, what it comes down to is that Python has used conservative 
<br>
version numbers.  This is something that Guido did.  I've only used 
<br>
Python heavily since version 1.4 (I played with 1.3 a few times), but 
<br>
the version history goes something like this:
<br>
<p>* 0 - 1.6 - These releases, if I recall correctly, each made 
<br>
improvements on the last, but nothing to warrant a big version number 
<br>
change.  There was one release where lots of stuff change how 
<br>
everything worked underneath (was it 1.3?) that probably would have 
<br>
sent things 2.0 if Larry had been taking care of version numbers.
<br>
<p>* 2.0 - now - Still mostly small changes.
<br>
<p>* Python 3000 - This is to be the all new Python that probably won't 
<br>
be backwards compatible but take all the experience of the years of 
<br>
Python development to make a really awesome language.  No ETA.
<br>
<p>And there you have it.  The version numbers were kept small in the 
<br>
start because Py3k was originally going to be Python 2.0, but as 
<br>
Python moved around in 2000 marketing pressures made 1.7 be 2.0 
<br>
(Guido has stated he doesn't care about version numbers, so he was 
<br>
fine with the change).
<br>
<p>If it helps, use this formula to get something along the lines of 
<br>
Perl like version numbers from Python version numbers:
<br>
<p>(py_ver - 1) * 10
<br>
<p>So, for example, 1.5.2 becomes 5.2.  Alas, this doesn't really work 
<br>
at the jump to 2.0, since that should be 1.7.  Oh well.
<br>
<p>Now, we're digressing too much, but I thought that would be useful in 
<br>
this thread.
