<p>A Scientist's Art: Computer Fiction
<br>
By KATIE HAFNER
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[PARA]Robert Burroughs for The New York Times[PARA]THE NOVELIST AS
<br>
SEERVernor Vinge, a fiction writer and professor emeritus of computer
<br>
science, in the library at San Diego State University.

<br>
commentary by David Pogue, the State of the Art columnist.
<br>
<p><p>AN DIEGO-VERNOR VINGE, a computer scientist at San Diego State University,
<br>
was one of the first not only to understand the power of computer networks
<br>
but also to paint elaborate scenarios about their effects on society. He has
<br>
long argued that machine intelligence will someday soon outstrip human
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
But Dr. Vinge does not publish technical papers on those topics. He writes
<br>
science fiction.
<br>
And in turning computer fact into published fiction, Dr. Vinge (pronounced
<br>
VIN-jee) has developed a readership so convinced of his prescience that
<br>
businesses seek his help in envisioning and navigating the decades to come.
<br>
&quot;Vernor can live, as few can, in the future,&quot; said Lawrence Wilkinson,
<br>
co-founder of Global Business Network, which specializes in corporate
<br>
planning. &quot;He can imagine extensions and elaborations on reality that aren't
<br>
provable, of course, but that are consistent with what we know.&quot;
<br>
Dr. Vinge's 1992 novel, &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep&quot; (Tor Books), which won the
<br>
prestigious Hugo Award for science fiction, is a grand &quot;space opera&quot; set
<br>
40,000 years in a future filled with unfathomable distances, the destruction
<br>
of entire planetary systems and doglike aliens. A reviewer in The Washington
<br>
Post (news/quote) called it &quot;a wide-screen science fiction epic of the type
<br>
few writers attempt any more, probably because nobody until Vinge has ever
<br>
done it well.&quot;
<br>
But computers, not aliens, were at the center of the work that put Dr. Vinge
<br>
on the science fiction map - &quot;True Names,&quot; a 30,000-word novella that
<br>
offered a vision of a networked world. It was published in 1981, long before
<br>
most people had heard of the Internet and a year before William Gibson's
<br>
story &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; coined the term that has come to describe such a
<br>
world: cyberspace.
<br>
For years, even as its renown has grown, &quot;True Names&quot; has been out of print
<br>
and hard to find. Now it is being reissued by Tor Books in &quot;True Names and
<br>
the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier,&quot; a collection of stories and essays
<br>
by computer scientists that is due out in December.
<br>
&quot;True Names&quot; is the tale of Mr. Slippery, a computer vandal who is caught by
<br>
the government and pressed into service to stop a threat greater than
<br>
himself. The story portrays a world rife with pseudonymous characters and
<br>
other elements of online life that now seem almost ho-hum. In retrospect, it
<br>
was prophetic.
<br>
&quot;The import of `True Names,' &quot; wrote Marvin Minsky, a pioneer in artificial
<br>
intelligence, in an afterword to an early edition of the work, &quot;is that it
<br>
is about how we cope with things we don't understand.&quot;
<br>
And computers are at the center of Dr. Vinge's vision of the challenges that
<br>
the coming decades will bring. A linchpin of his thinking is what he calls
<br>
the &quot;technological singularity,&quot; a point at which the intelligence of
<br>
machines takes a huge leap, and they come to possess capabilities that
<br>
exceed those of humans. As a result, ultra- intelligent machines become
<br>
capable of upgrading themselves, humans cease to be the primary players, and
<br>
the future becomes unknowable.
<br>
Dr. Vinge sees the singularity as probable if not inevitable, most likely
<br>
arriving between 2020 and 2040.
<br>
Indeed, any conversation with Dr. Vinge, 56, inevitably turns to the
<br>
singularity. It is a preoccupation he recognizes with self-effacing humor as
<br>
&quot;my usual shtick.&quot;
<br>
Although he has written extensively about the singularity as a scientific
<br>
concept, he is humble about laying intellectual claim to it. In fact, with
<br>
titles like &quot;Approximation by Faber Polynomials for a Class of Jordan
<br>
Domains&quot; and &quot;Teaching FORTH on a VAX,&quot; Dr. Vinge's academic papers bear
<br>
little resemblance to the topics he chooses for his fiction.
<br>
&quot;The ideas about the singularity and the future of computation are things
<br>
that basically occurred to me on the basis of my experience of what I know
<br>
about computers,&quot; he said.
<br>
&quot;And although that is at a professional level, it's not because of some
<br>
great research insight I had or even a not-so-great research insight I had.
<br>
It's because I've been watching these things and I like to think about where
<br>
things could go.&quot;
<br>
Dr. Vinge readily concedes that his worldview has been shaped by science
<br>
fiction, which he has been reading and writing since childhood. His dream,
<br>
he said, was to be a scientist, and &quot;the science fiction was just part of
<br>
the dreaming.&quot;
<br>
Trained as a mathematician, Dr. Vinge said he did not begin &quot;playing with
<br>
real computers&quot; until the early 1970's, after he had started teaching at San
<br>
Diego State. His teaching gradually shifted to computer science, focusing on
<br>
computer networks and distributed systems. He received tenure in 1977.
<br>
&quot;Teaching networks and operating systems was a constant source of story
<br>
inspiration,&quot; Dr. Vinge said. The idea for &quot;True Names&quot; came from an
<br>
exchange he had one day in the late 1970's while using an early form of
<br>
instant messaging called Talk.
<br>
&quot;Suddenly I was accosted by another user via the Talk program,&quot; he recalled.
<br>
&quot;We chatted briefly, each trying to figure out the other's true name.
<br>
Finally I gave up and told the other person I had to go - that I was
<br>
actually a personality simulator, and if I kept talking, my artificial
<br>
nature would become obvious. Afterwards I realized that I had just lived a
<br>
science fiction story.&quot;
<br>
Computers and artificial intelligence are, of course, at the center of much
<br>
science fiction, including the current Steven Spielberg film, &quot;A.I.&quot; In the
<br>
Spielberg vision, a robotic boy achieves a different sort of singularity:
<br>
parity with humans not just in intelligence but in emotion, too. &quot;To me, the
<br>
big leap of faith is to make that little boy,&quot; Dr. Vinge said. &quot;We don't
<br>
have evidence of progress toward that. If it ever happens, there will be a
<br>
runaway effect, and getting to something a whole lot better than human will
<br>
happen really fast.&quot;
<br>
How fast? &quot;Maybe 36 hours,&quot; Dr. Vinge replied.
<br>
Dr. Vinge's own work has yet to make it to the screen, although &quot;True Names&quot;
<br>
has been under option for five years. &quot;It's been a long story of my trying
<br>
to convince studio executives to really consider the work seriously because
<br>
it seemed so far out,&quot; said David Baxter, a Hollywood writer and producer
<br>
who is writing the screenplay with Mark Pesce, co-creator of Virtual Reality
<br>
Modeling Language, or VRML. &quot;But as time has passed, the world has started
<br>
to match what was in the book.&quot;
<br>
In the meantime Dr. Vinge has been providing scenarios in the corporate
<br>
world as well. He is one of several science fiction writers who have worked
<br>
with Global Business Network in anticipating future situations and plotting
<br>
strategies for several major companies.
<br>
Mr. Wilkinson, the co-founder of Global Business Network, said that Dr.
<br>
Vinge's work with the group provided &quot;an unbelievably fertile perspective
<br>
from which to look back at and reunderstand the present.&quot;
<br>
&quot;It's that ability to conceptualize whole new ways of framing issues, whole
<br>
new contexts that could emerge,&quot; Mr. Wilkinson said. &quot;In the process he has
<br>
contributed to the turnarounds of at least two well-known technology
<br>
companies.&quot;
<br>
Dr. Vinge, shy and reserved, is hardly a self-promoter. He scrupulously
<br>
assigns credit to others whenever he can. And although he insists that much
<br>
of his work is highly derivative, his fans do not necessarily share that
<br>
view.
<br>
&quot;The thing that distinguishes Vernor is he's a scientist and all of his
<br>
stuff makes sense,&quot; Mr. Baxter said. &quot;It's all grounded in the here and
<br>
now.&quot;
<br>
Dr. Vinge is now a professor emeritus at San Diego State, having retired to
<br>
devote his time to his writing and consulting. Over lunch at a restaurant
<br>
not far from the university, he described a story he was working on.
<br>
&quot;Well, there's a recovering Alzheimer's patient,&quot; Dr. Vinge began, before
<br>
being interrupted and asked how one could be a recovering Alzheimer's
<br>
patient.
<br>
His eyes brightened. &quot;You can't,&quot; he said, and a sly smile crossed his face.
<br>
&quot;Yet.&quot;
