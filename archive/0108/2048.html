<p>I guess you could reduce my opinion (at least one of them) down to this:  I 
<br>
very much agree that the Singularity could be very good, or very bad 
<br>
(extinction of the human race).  I also agree that we need to work to make 
<br>
it good.  Where I disagree, unfortunately, is in how much effect we will have.
<br>
<p>When I first read &quot;Staring Into the Singularity&quot; I started thinking about 
<br>
how much more, well just more/different, an SI would be than ourselves.  As 
<br>
it has been discussed in this room, most people believe that a human can't 
<br>
even talk with an SI though a binary (light on/off) connection without 
<br>
having them be controlled by the SI.  Given such vast intellect, 
<br>
capabilities and the freedom to fully alter its own code I don't believe 
<br>
there is anything we can program into an AI that will ensure friendliness 
<br>
when it gets to SI status.  We're just not anywhere near smart enough to do 
<br>
that.  I really wish I didn't believe this (it would make me happier), but 
<br>
this is what extensive thought on the matter leads me to believe.
<br>
<p>Based on this belief, the best course may be to hold off on launching an AI 
<br>
that could progress to an SI until we have the ability to enhance our 
<br>
intelligence significantly.  Humans with much greater intelligence *may* be 
<br>
able to alter/control a SI, but I believe that ultimately we cannot.  But I 
<br>
suspect that we will have Real AI and most likely SI before that comes to 
<br>
pass, thus my belief that if SIs aren't inherently friendly we are probably 
<br>
doomed.
