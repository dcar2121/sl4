</em><br>
<em>&gt;only the first step toward good writing...
</em><br>
<p>That sounds about right.  When I write I generally throughly massage 
<br>
my words before publishing them.  With this, though, I need to get my 
<br>
ideas out there before I go back and refine my language so that it is 
<br>
more concise and precise because this is a complex topic and I know 
<br>
that I can leave things out if I'm not careful.  Thus, you're all 
<br>
getting the beta version of paper to make sure I include everything 
<br>
(i.e. spark discussion and figure out what I still need to write 
<br>
about).
<br>
<p>Oh, and yes, I know quite a bit about writing (even if my e-mails 
<br>
don't always reflect that ;-)).  Polished sentences are easy, but 
<br>
diction that doesn't send even SL4ers running for the hills, that's 
<br>
what's hard.  Maybe it's time I released /Gordon's Unabridged 
<br>
Dictionary/.  ;-)

<p>Agreed, but I do see how the ideas connect (both are supposed to be 
<br>
underlying forces of the universe, and that's what the Sysop is in 
<br>
Sysop Space, but the similarities end there).
