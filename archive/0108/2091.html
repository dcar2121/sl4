<p>
For the sysop to perform the tasks set out by Eli and Brian, it will have to
<br>
be more ambitious than some of the suggestions here.  If it is going to
<br>
protect against dangerous uses of nanotech (not just grey goo scenarios but
<br>
some manipulations of genetics and brains), sysop space is not just
<br>
computronium, it is the entire known universe.  And if it is going to
<br>
protect the inviolability of your self, whether code or wetware, as well as
<br>
protect your property and keep you from being infitrated by tainted programs
<br>
or data that would deprive you of your volition (see the &quot;you can't keep a
<br>
bad AI down in a black box&quot; thread), there is no doubt that the sysop is
<br>
simply the new government of the known universe.  Like all governments, it
<br>
will outlaw some forms of destructive activity, define and strongly protect
<br>
rights in your person, define and protect property rights in computing
<br>
resources and perhaps real world resources, and set up rules for voluntary
<br>
transactions such as prohibiting fraud and mandating disclosure of dangerous
<br>
effects of programs and data.  In sorting out what a sysop would likely do,
<br>
it might help to separately consider its various functions: What activities
<br>
will it prohibit and use force to prevent, what protections will it give
<br>
your person, what scheme of property rights and markets will it establish,
<br>
what activities will be permitted only if regulated, what disclosure rules
<br>
will be enforced, where will the sysop independently provide information and
<br>
warnings even if it doesn't mandate disclosure from one of the transacting
<br>
parties...
<br>
<p>Some people won't like the sysop for just this reason.  They were hoping the
<br>
singularity would drive governments to extinction.  But using an innocuous
<br>
term like Unix scenario will not fool many people, and it will keep you from
<br>
squarely addressing the need for the sysop (if need there be), the
<br>
protections it can give, and the ways it can be made friendly.
<br>
<p>As for opting out, there actually is a little hope for James Higgins.
<br>
Partial opt out provisions are inevitable.  Protections against nanotech
<br>
disaster will be mandatory, but some of the schemes for disclosure, property
<br>
and markets need not be.  If citizens after singularity differ much more
<br>
than contemporary humans in design and mental ability, there will likely be
<br>
different regimes of protection and disclosure for different classes of
<br>
citizens. As the sysop could in some respects tailor protections and
<br>
disclosures for each individual, there is the possibility of individuals
<br>
disclaiming some protections.   And if someone wants to get in a spaceship
<br>
and head out for the frontier (and thus disconnect from the higher bandwidth
<br>
aspects of the web), it is very likely that some of the sysops functions
<br>
would no longer apply.
<br>
<p>Using protection of volition as the moral underpinning of the sysops
<br>
activity is fair enough, so long as it is understood as a gesture in a
<br>
general direction, rather than anything more specific.  Both Kant and Mill
<br>
can be understood as using protection of volition as the foundation of their
<br>
moral theories, but they differ on many issues.  (Even Ayn Rand might be put
<br>
in that group, if one thought her writings were rational, moral, or
<br>
philosophical.  I don't, but some here do, and agreements on practical
<br>
issues among these three will not be all that plentiful.)  Gordon Worley's
<br>
attempt to diffuse situations where volitions conflict by using an
<br>
active/passive distinction (doesn't that capture the &quot;doing/done to&quot;
<br>
language?) does as well as most attempts: it solves some but not nearly all
<br>
situations (at the cost of changing a protection of volition theory to a
<br>
protection of justifiable volition theory where the &quot;justifiable&quot; does much
<br>
of the work).  But hey, if thinking through morality were that easy, we
<br>
would have one less reason for developing more than human intelligence.
