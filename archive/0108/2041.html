From: Amara D. Angelica &lt;<a href="mailto:amara@kurzweilai.net?Subject=Re:%20Article:%20The%20coming%20superintelligence:%20who%20will%20be%20in%20control?">amara@kurzweilai.net</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Is there a consensus on this list that the Singularity is good and should
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; accelerated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
If I understand Brian's post he seems to be in agreement with others that
<br>
the logically prior question here is &quot;which Singularity?&quot; Is it the case
<br>
that all our future histories end up at THE Singularity, or is it possible
<br>
that there might be different ways of effecting A Singularity? Having
<br>
answered this, then we can go on to ask about the timing of a (the)
<br>
Singularity. I take it that the position of the Singularity Institute is
<br>
that it is possible to affect which Singularity we pass through--otherwise
<br>
why all the fuss about Friendly AI? Certainly, in the absence of definitive
<br>
knowledge that we cannot affect our future history, this seems like the
<br>
correct default assumption. (If we struggle to affect a certain Singularity,
<br>
and in fact there is only one form of the Singularity, then at worst our
<br>
efforts will have been in vain. If we do not struggle to affect a certain
<br>
Singularity, and in fact there are multiple Singularities we might pass
<br>
through (some better, some worse), then we may be culpable for the worst
<br>
form of negligence in human history.).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own view then would be that we ought to accelerate friendly
<br>
Singularities and attempt to impede or deflect unfriendly or afriendly
<br>
Singularities in favour of the former.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I wonder if some people's thinking is misled by the choice of pronoun
<br>
here. Generally, would it be better to speak of 'a Singularity' rather than
<br>
'the Singularity' in order that this question is not prejudged? Although I
<br>
must admit, 'A Singularity Institute' does not quite have the same ring to
<br>
it). Mark
