<em>&gt; &gt;Ok, it's time to ask if this scenario is more than a bad Sci-Fi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;plot. I think it relates to a class of problems such as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;1) Should an SI spend time looking for other hidden AI's as soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         as possible?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;2) Should an SI spend time looking for ET?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;3) Should an SI spend time trying to determine if it is already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;         in a simulation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Of course only an SI should decide these things, but we as humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;already pour resources into #2. Maybe the DOD spends money on #1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And #3...well, that's deliciously undetectable isn't it ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of the above?  If it is truly an &quot;SI&quot;, then these tasks should be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trivial for it (at least when comparing its ability to ours).  It should be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to spot #1 easily, since it is an SI looking for AIs.  
</em><br>
<p>I was thinking more along the lines of &quot;How much if any time should an SI 
<br>
(or an AI) spend?&quot;. It's one of those things that might seem unlikely, but
<br>
have a huge impact if found...or it could be a wild goose chase resulting
<br>
in nothing. Should an SI spend time wondering if there is a God? Or being
<br>
in a simulation (below)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If there has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been contact, #2 should be simple since it should be easy an SI to get the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real truth out of any human.  If there has not been any contact, #2 would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be incredibly difficult if they didn't want to be found since they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to either be or have SIs themselves.  
</em><br>
<p>Again, I was thinking: &quot;How much time should an SI spend looking for aliens?&quot;
<br>
Perhaps after all the major problems are resolved, ie. we are safely drifting
<br>
in space reliant on our own portable energy sources, famine and disease
<br>
erased, an SI might turn ver attention to ET life. 
<br>
<p>Currently there are humans working at SETI full time, while others are
<br>
dying of malnutrition. Admittedly you don't see me devoting my life to
<br>
saving lives...I'm making frivolous movies. Perhaps this is my twofold
<br>
answer to Amara's question:
<br>
<p>It is good to hasten the advent of the Singularity because:
<br>
<p>1) We can save lives and improve quality of life.
<br>
<p>2) We can avert disasters of mismanaging potentially dangerous (yet
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beneficial) new technologies (nanotech, bioengineering). 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, we want to create a source of decision making
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(an SI) that is more reliable than humans in the task
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ensuring our safety.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The last one could be a piece 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cake for an SI, or maybe not.  Heck if #3 is true, creating an SI either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be possible at all or it may halt the simulation (god, I hope that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't it).  Or the goal of the simulation may have been to produce an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SI!  Do  yourself a favor, don't get me started on #3.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, if the simulation is created by an SI of greater intelligence, S'
<br>
(S prime), don't you think that S' would have sealed off the simulation
<br>
so that it can't be altered or halted from &quot;inside&quot;?
<br>
<p>Oh wait, I wasn't supposed to get you started on #3 ;-)
