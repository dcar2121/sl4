Greetings to each and everyone =)
<br>
<p>Quoting James Higgins:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
I don't have to examine the Webmind design or code because no one can in
<br>
fact define exactly what Real AI is.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, oh, oh !! But you can define exactly how my brains work ? Where is what
<br>
etc... If not, where would RNIs be safer, faster, better than SIAI, Fai or
<br>
whatever ? You seem to be pretty closed-minded on the whole issue. I can
<br>
feel you biased but I do not know why. _yet_ =)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Given a fully functioning General AI, the availability of strong nanotech,
<br>
and that this AI has access to nanotech (I find this VERY unlikely), then
<br>
yes.  But what fool is going to give a seed AI access to nanotech?  And
<br>
this still requires a functioning General AI that we still have no idea how
<br>
to build.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The same type of fool that believe that fully intelligent (same level as
<br>
FAI, self optimizing, etc....) RNIs will be here before SIAI or that RNIs
<br>
are more/less advanced. They are both far away, with pros and cons.
<br>
Which fruit is more a fruit than the other one ? The orange or the pear ?
<br>
None, they both are fruits, period.
<br>
Will all due respect, to me, you and that fool, do look
<br>
quite similar. Go take that Vision interface, come here and make it work on
<br>
my shattered knee caps =), then we'll talk =) By then FAI will be all over
<br>
the place =)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
More developers = longer development cycle.  It is a myth that adding
<br>
developers speeds up development!  A professional typist would get in the
<br>
way, try using voice recognition (even good ones) for coding some ...
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>***Which part of ***
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;if it was the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that typing speeds were what was holding software creation back, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could simply throw more developers at a project and it would get done
</em><br>
<em>&gt;faster. Or hire professional typists and let the programmers talk really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast :-)
</em><br>
<p>***did you not understand ?***
<br>
Indeed, you quoted Brian to say *exactly* what he said !!!? I'm missing
<br>
something here ! *smile*
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
I'm not biased!  I'm simply trying to state that we don't have any real,
<br>
honest estimation of when we'll get either neural implants or general
<br>
AI.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>*cough* we don't have an honest estimate/tion of anything at all !! That is
<br>
the whole point about creating SIAI =)
<br>
I was given 18 months to live at the end of 1997 for a lung condition. See
<br>
what I mean by estimate ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Ok, Brian.  We've been going back and forth and you have yet to even touch
<br>
on a response when I ask you the same type of question.  So what is the
<br>
design for general AI?  Please provide us with all the nifty details so
<br>
that we can actually compare the neural path with the general AI path and
<br>
make some informed projections.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Have you read anything at all on Low Beyond or the Singist website ? Did you
<br>
understand it ? Did you understand why you did not understand some of the
<br>
stuff ? What I mean is, are you able to understand **why** you do not
<br>
understand something ? Do you spend time on how you think ? Do you always
<br>
have a second 'James' who's tearing apart anything you do, think ? A 3rd
<br>
'James' ? 4th ? If not, go back to it, the answers are there. When you do
<br>
not understand **something in particular** please ask. Just saying: &quot;Explain
<br>
!!!&quot; will get you nowhere on this list. A preferred approach would be: &quot; In
<br>
Section *xyz*, I seem to disagree with *abc* because *jkl*. I'm yet to see
<br>
you do that =)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
YES!  Oh, come on now, your going to tell us that you wouldn't want such an
<br>
implant yourself?  Honestly.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>***WHICH part of ***
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
For us yes,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>***don't you understand ?***
<br>
<p>Maaaaaaaan, all I see you do is slam at anything that you disagree with !!!?
<br>
I get excited, thinking you gonna shed some light on interesting stuff, but
<br>
no, you seem to read and understand only part of the stuff you read.
<br>
You wrote 350 something thousand lines of code in a year ? Well designed and
<br>
stuff ?? In what ? Basic ? If you can read a sentence and forget part of it
<br>
in the time it takes you to answer it, boooooooy, I don't want to look at
<br>
your code. Stop dissing Brian, no one cares whether you agree or not as long
<br>
you aren't pulling weight. There is a Lady Atkins on this list who was
<br>
really skeptical about the whole thing right at the begining, go read her
<br>
posts in the archives, and see what is a constructive way of discussing
<br>
stuff.
<br>
<p>Kind regards =)
<br>
<p>P.S. You need a lot more testing with RNIs than with FAI for at the max a
<br>
10th of the advancement. Ratio = 1/10 = 0.1 = not worth it. Before you
<br>
disagree with me, re-read my words and don't forget or discard the bits you
<br>
don't want. When you said that you bet Brian did not know much about the
<br>
current state ot the art in RNIs, I had the faint feeling that what you
<br>
called 'state of the art' came from the 'Science &amp; Technology' section of
<br>
the Sunday Times. I could be really mistaken, if so, show me or explain to
<br>
me the current state of the art ***that YOU do, did, were involved with***
<br>
You see, most ppl on this list, think, design, and try to implement working
<br>
stuff. By the way you talk, it would seem that you do the same insofar as
<br>
RNIs are concerned. Enlighten us  =)
