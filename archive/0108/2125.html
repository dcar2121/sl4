<br>
<em>&gt;Concerning the question of trade post-singularity, Christian L. scoffed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If a human made a great painting, you could always tell the Sysop to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; replicate one for you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For free?  No royalties?  You could also tell it to steal it.  The question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is whether it would do what you ask.  (Napster has a lot to answer for!)
</em><br>
<p>When we get to this stage, information will most likely be free.  It has 
<br>
already been discussed that privacy will most likely not be an option post 
<br>
Singularity.  Privacy is simply the protection of information about 
<br>
you.  If this is not feasible, I don't think it will be feasible to protect 
<br>
intellectual property either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Security? The primary goal of the Sysop is security. What use would a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bodyguard have if no one can harm you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1) The Sysop will certainly provide basic security services to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;major harms.  Whether it will provide all possible security services, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether it will agree with you as to what constitutes a harm are separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions.  People hire nontech security now not only to backstop the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;police, but also to do things the police won't, like put their bodies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inbetween papparazi cameras and famous faces.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) Conspicuous consumption.  (Or do you think that come the revolution we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will outlaw conspicuous consumption?)
</em><br>
<p>I thought this was the whole argument as to why we need a sysop?  If the 
<br>
thing can't protect you from petty things that a body guard can, then how 
<br>
can it protect us from all that other stuff it is supposed to?  It is 
<br>
supposed to do your bidding, so it would have to honor YOUR version of what 
<br>
constitutes harm to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;If you want to learn something, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be the best teacher? A human or a Superintelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This may be the heart of our disagreement.  I envisage a future with many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Superintelligences&quot;, an entire ecology, not just us humans and single
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parent Sysop.  I assume specialization will triumph over one omnicompetent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supercitizen.  Perhaps we could design a world where each person only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interacted with the Sysop, who recreated an entire artificial world for each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of us designed to make us happy, but do we want to?  I think one part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eli's design of friendliness, with an accent on preserving citizen autonomy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to design an AI that would reject that type of Sysop role.  I expect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sysop, and friendly major powers generally, to leave to lesser powers and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans (which may become lesser powers eventually for all we know) those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tasks that they can handle.
</em><br>
<p>Knowledge, the same all virtually all information, will almost certainly be 
<br>
free.  Thus it should be relatively easy to learn anything you wish to 
<br>
devote sufficient time to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;And frankly, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you are so extremely shy that you need to PAY people to talk to you, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sysop kan kindly ask your permission to rewire some basic social skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Considering the billions people currently pay for conversation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated activities, from therapy and sexwork to bars and bowling leagues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suspect that your vision of the future is not that everyone develops
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social skills, but that everyone gives up on them and just lives in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solopsistic world with the Sysop.
</em><br>
<p>It may not be his &quot;vision&quot; for the future, but it is a real 
<br>
possibility.  Have you ever heard of that rat where they hooked up an 
<br>
electrode directly to its pleasure center connected to a button?  If I 
<br>
remember it correctly the thing died because it never stopped pressing the 
<br>
button even to eat.
<br>
<p>Having a Sysop that will provide you with a VR world of your choosing is 
<br>
pretty dam close to just that.  Plus it will protect you from any harm and 
<br>
limit personal interactions to only those you choose to participate 
<br>
in.  I'm afraid most of the human race may very well vanish into their own 
<br>
VR realms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;What do you mean by trading space? How many cubic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; light-years do you need? For what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I just need a location close to my friends and far away from people who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rude or aggravating.  Funny how that always seems to cost something.  And if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you think some people will not try to grab prime real estate, such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sphere around any star out to the orbit of the third or fourth planet, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have never met a real estate developer.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Real Estate&quot; will for the most part be virtual.  It won't matter who you 
<br>
are adjacent to in any way.  If everything is computronium, the only thing 
<br>
that matters is how long it takes to get signals to and from your chosen 
<br>
associates locations.  Besides, as I understand it the Sysop will be 
<br>
responsible for allocating resources (matter).  Thus a &quot;real estate 
<br>
developer&quot; could only amass matter if they could get people to give it to 
<br>
them.  And as matter will be the all important resource, I doubt anyone 
<br>
intelligent would seriously be willing to part with any of theirs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Why would there be a shortage of space?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why are land values high in Los Vegas, when there is empty desert all around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it?  Why do people pay for domain names, when there are so many unclaimed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The only truly valuable thing post-singularity is probably only matter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; energy, or only energy if you consider E=mc^2,
</em><br>
<p>Knowledge &amp; information will also be valuable, but they will be free.  Much 
<br>
like Linux is valuable yet free.
