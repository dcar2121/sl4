<em>&gt; From: James Higgins &lt;<a href="mailto:jameshiggins@earthlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Opting%20out%20of%20the%20Sysop%20scenario?">jameshiggins@earthlink.net</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Further, why couldn't individuals come and go from the Sysop's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sphere?  Let's say I want to go check out Alpha Centauri.  The sysop denies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me this ability because that is outside her control.  I leave the Sysop's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain, travel to Alpha Centarui, do my stuff and then return, reentering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Sysop's domain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, what are your thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>What? and bring back a Trojan Horse from an UnFriendly SI? ;-)
<br>
<p>IMPERIALISM
<br>
-----------
<br>
<p>As Dan Clemmensen mentioned:
<br>
<p>&quot;The sysop controls and allocates all available resources.&quot; 
<br>
<p>which has an underlying assumption to it, that is, when the
<br>
Singularity ramps up, we are speculating that we will spread
<br>
nano-spores to investigate and colonize all matter that has no
<br>
detectable sentience beings present. Isn't it interesting that 
<br>
the arc of Life to fill every available niche might scale to all 
<br>
known mattter.
<br>
<p>This does, however, sound a bit like that nasty human project of 
<br>
just a few generations back: Imperialism, only now on a galactic
<br>
scale. Hopefully Friendly Imperialism (preserving and enhancing
<br>
volition) is actually the right thing to do (I think it is). The
<br>
SI is charged with coming up with some version of a Prime 
<br>
Directive(*). So shortly after Singularity (or part of) we spread 
<br>
out to Alpha Centauri and reach all places where one might even 
<br>
think of travelling. Where ever you go, we will be there. The
<br>
good thing is that if an Alien SI has something better than 
<br>
Friendliness, our SI should be smart enough to adopt it. (Scotty,
<br>
Memetic Shields on full!)
<br>
<p>One possibility is that all the dark matter in the universe is
<br>
already &quot;colonized&quot; by an earlier SI. 
<br>
<p><p>CONTROL
<br>
-------
<br>
<p>There is another psychological aspect of JamesH's concern and that
<br>
is control. Humans (and many other animals) hate to be under the 
<br>
control of another. As someone who likes the idea of a Unix Reality 
<br>
Scenario(*), I have to tell you I am not a masochist who would
<br>
ordinarily like to have my entire world dictated to me. However, I
<br>
am quite willing to enter into a social contract which protects
<br>
my volition and the volition of others I care about, just like I
<br>
use a version of UNIX at work which (mostly) protects people from
<br>
destroying other's data (purposefully or otherwise). I do not rebel
<br>
against this, protesting my lack of permission to roam around and
<br>
view everyone's files. I guess some people might feel this is an
<br>
unfair limitation, but I doubt they would last long at any company.
<br>
<p>Perhaps we can think about it as a legal system. We all agree to obey
<br>
the rules for our own protection, vs. reverting to anarchy. This is
<br>
a starting point however, because any technologically deficient Legal 
<br>
System can't statisfy everyone. The current U.S. system violates the 
<br>
volition of, say, murderers and adults who want to have sex with
<br>
children. It allows humans to slaughter animals which really annoys
<br>
members of PETA. It allows abortions which really annoys the Christian
<br>
Right. It prevents you from growing certain natural plants and
<br>
smoking them. In a VR enhanced society with Friendliness, we can live 
<br>
out our fantasies, whatever they are, in complete safety with respect 
<br>
to other sentient beings. A lowest level prevention mechanism of a 
<br>
physical operating system would prevent one sentient from actually 
<br>
harming another. 
<br>
<p>This &quot;prevention&quot; though, is a form of &quot;control&quot;. There seems no way
<br>
around it. It is the *feeling* of being under another's control that 
<br>
is bitterly rejected. Perhaps one way out of the contradiction is to
<br>
voluntarily live in a make believe world where we &quot;think&quot; we have
<br>
complete free will and then periodically are &quot;revived&quot;, reminded
<br>
that we, ourselves, set ourselves up to believe this fake reality for
<br>
our own peace of mind and are given the choice of continuing the
<br>
simulation or not.
<br>
<p>On the one hand, we want freedom. On the other we don't want to 
<br>
allow ourselves to harm one another. 
<br>
<p>(JamesH),
<br>
<p>Would you be willing to take &quot;The Illusion of Freedom with Periodic 
<br>
Resuscitation&quot; as a compromise? ;-) If not you could always stay
<br>
on old Earth OR try to travel faster than the galactically 
<br>
spreading Sysop...you'll have those real choices at least. The other 
<br>
way is to deactive your &quot;need&quot; to feel free of the Operating System, 
<br>
but for some reason, I don't think you'd want to do that. 
<br>
<p><p>(*) As in Star Trek's Prime Directive not to interfere with a less
<br>
advanced civilization.
<br>
<p>(**) Are we trying to replace the phrase &quot;Sysop&quot;, which is too 
<br>
anthropomorphic?
