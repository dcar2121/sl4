<p>
here are some musings on intelligent self-modification, based on past
<br>
experience prototyping similar things in Webmind Inc., and our plans for the
<br>
future with the Webmind AI Engine
<br>
<p>It's a long and winding train of thought, but if you follow it to the end,
<br>
you may find it interesting...
<br>
<p>In Webmind, the approach we use to schema learning (procedure learning,
<br>
program learning) is unique, but the best way to cast it in non-Webmindish
<br>
terms is to call it &quot;a fusion of evolutionary programming and probabilistic
<br>
inference and neural-nettish association spreading.&quot;  Of course it's really
<br>
nothing so awkward as a pasting-together of these three things, but it does
<br>
involve these three aspects.
<br>
<p>In ev. comp. terms, one of the issues that arises is schema learning is
<br>
brittleness.  Mutating and crossing over most working programs leads to
<br>
useless or even meaningless programs.  Of course, some programming languages
<br>
are brittler than others; LISP is much less brittle in this sense than C++,
<br>
for example.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, DNA, which is the programming language that is used to
<br>
encode living organisms on Earth, is remarkably robust and un-brittle in
<br>
this sense.  DNA programs can be mutated and crossed over relatively freely
<br>
(yes, there are constraints, there are 'hot spots' where crossover is more
<br>
likely, etc.) with a decent probability of producing a functioning, though
<br>
different offspring.  The reason for the robustness here is that the
<br>
&quot;compiler&quot; (the network of protein-protein interactions that build cells,
<br>
cell interactions that build bodies, etc.) is very, very tolerant of errors,
<br>
and has a lot of clever ways to make things work and come out interestingly
<br>
instead of erroneously.  The DNA program is fairly interpretable as the
<br>
initial condition of a complex self-organizing system (the developing cell)
<br>
rather than as a series of instructions for a logical system.  (Both
<br>
interpretations shed some light, actually.)
<br>
<p>How is this kind of robustness to be achieved in the mind, in the context of
<br>
schema learning?
<br>
<p>I believe that in the mind there needs to be at least 2 levels of
<br>
representation for procedures.  This is not a new idea, it occurs in various
<br>
forms in the &quot;AI planning&quot; literature, but it's usually mixed up with
<br>
various other things.
<br>
<p>1) &quot;pseudocode&quot; level, where the basic procedure being carried out is
<br>
outlined in &quot;almost precise&quot; terms
<br>
2) &quot;program code&quot; level, where everything is really laid out in detail
<br>
<p>The analogy I wish to draw is:
<br>
<p>Thinking Mind			Developing organism
<br>
--------------------------------------------------
<br>
Pseudocode					DNA
<br>
Program code				organism
<br>
Procedural refinement			epigenesis/development
<br>
<p>Of course, this is a very limited and flawed analogy, but there may be
<br>
something to be learned from it.  That is, there may be some small aspects
<br>
in which the analogy is valid.
<br>
<p>The idea is that, on the pseudocode level, mutations and crossovers lead to
<br>
algorithms that may be useless, but are generally semantically meaningful.
<br>
One can freely play around with pseudocode.
<br>
<p>Getting from pseudocode to program code is a matter of &quot;procedural
<br>
refinement&quot;, one aspect of procedural cognition -- and this can be very hard
<br>
thinking, of course, involving invocation of relevant experiences, formal
<br>
knowledge of algorithms, knowledge of the operating conditions of the
<br>
program, etc...
<br>
<p>My feeling is that, in the human mind, we
<br>
<p>a) come equipped at birth with the shell of a &quot;pseudocode&quot; representation of
<br>
procedures
<br>
b) fill out this shell into a complete internal pseudocode framework through
<br>
experimentation with procedures of physical action
<br>
c) through the experience of translating pseudocode representations of
<br>
real-world actions into detailed real-world action programs, we gain an
<br>
intuition for procedural cognition (including procedural refinement, as well
<br>
as the learning of new pseudocode programs)
<br>
d) later on, take our pseudocode and procedural cognition frameworks and
<br>
extend them to abstract procedural domains
<br>
<p>A very common example of the distinction between what I'm calling the
<br>
pseudocode level and the program code level is *timing*.  A plan, in the AI
<br>
literature, rarely includes precise timing of events; a schedule, on the
<br>
other hand, does.  Planning involves figuring out what steps to take whereas
<br>
scheduling involves figuring out exactly when to take them.  Filling in
<br>
timings is one example of something that happens during the transformation
<br>
from pseudocode to program code.
<br>
<p>In Webmind terms, the pseudocode level basically consists of a node-and-link
<br>
representation of schema *without* any of the schema-specific bells and
<br>
whistles (like token-passing to indicate that one procedure can't start
<br>
until another has finished, etc.).   The program code level consists of a
<br>
fully-specified node-and-link representation of a schema.
<br>
<p>*IF* one had a procedural refinement approach that worked -- i.e. a set of
<br>
mind-processes that take in pseudocode and spit out program code (in the WM
<br>
case, the program code is a fully specified schema) -- then one would be
<br>
well-positioned to tune the system to learn new pseudocode to approach new
<br>
problems.  Because for each new candidate bit of pseudocode, the system
<br>
would know how to create a new program code embodying the ideas outlines in
<br>
the pseudocode, thus being able to test the pragmatic validity of the
<br>
pseudocode.
<br>
<p>If we're to use the human case as an analogy, then procedural refinement is
<br>
going to have to be learned or minimally parameter-tuned by the system via
<br>
experimentation in a simple action domain (simpler than the domain of
<br>
modifying its own source code for example).  Here is where all the classic
<br>
AI problems of playing games, moving blocks around, etc., become potentially
<br>
interesting.  If a system can't translate pseudocode into program code in
<br>
simple contexts like this, having it do so in the context of modifying its
<br>
own behavioral schema is obviously pretty hopeless...
<br>
<p>The difference between these thoughts and our past WM work on schema
<br>
learning is basically the strictness of the breakdown into two levels.
<br>
Before we had
<br>
<p>--&gt; SchemaConceptNodes, an abstract level for reasoning about procedures
<br>
--&gt; SchemaNodes, for actually carrying out procedures
<br>
<p>and we actually had relations between SCN's and SN's on different levels of
<br>
granularity, but we hadn't formalized a distinction between two granularity
<br>
levels of schema relationships (here posited as pseudocode-ish and
<br>
program-code-ish)
<br>
<p>This is actually a point that was raised many times in past (WM-internal)
<br>
discussions on schema learning, in the guise of the need for a &quot;plan
<br>
optimization&quot; phase.  But the idea there, I think, was that the first phase
<br>
of schema learning would result in an inefficient but detailed program, to
<br>
be refined into an efficient one.  what I'm suggesting here is that the
<br>
first phase actually doesn't result in the learning of a detailed program at
<br>
all, but just a pseudocode sketch.
<br>
<p>OK -- that's all for now.  The next step in the train of thought goes into
<br>
the details of pseudocode versus program code for WM schema, and I won't
<br>
type that stuff in now.
