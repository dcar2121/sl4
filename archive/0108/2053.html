</em><br>
<p>I'm not suggesting that we take neural enhanced humans up to the SI 
<br>
stage.  Quite the contrary, actually.  My belief is that it requires 
<br>
greater than human intelligence to ensure that a friendly AI would 
<br>
successfully transition into a friendly SI.  If you, Eli, were 100 times 
<br>
more intelligent than you are now you would be able to account for many 
<br>
more possible problems than even 10,000 people probably could working together.
<br>
<p>This is not to say that we shouldn't try.  We should, I just consider our 
<br>
chances low at present.  The closer the creators of the SI are to SI 
<br>
status, the more they could understand the process involved and the most 
<br>
desirable end result.  Thus humans who are 10, 100 or even 1,000 times 
<br>
smarter than we are today would be very beneficial to the Singularity 
<br>
cause.  But, as stated previously, I don't think we'll get said humans 
<br>
before we get an SI.
