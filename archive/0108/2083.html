<p>
The milestones for seed AI have nothing to do with Flare.  Flare is a more
<br>
powerful programming tool.  The AI doesn't take its shape from Flare. 
<br>
Flare is necessary but it is not the be-all and end-all of AI.
<br>
<p>Background:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/seedAI/">http://intelligence.org/seedAI/</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://intelligence.org/GISAI/">http://intelligence.org/GISAI/</a>
<br>
<p>The first milestones for seed AI are:
<br>
<p>1.  The parts work in isolation.
<br>
2.  The parts all work together to create a single choreographed thought.
<br>
<p>When I say &quot;choreographed&quot;, I mean that the thought is not spontaneous or
<br>
emergent in any way; everyone got together and figured out exactly how it
<br>
was going to work, and set up all the machinery in advance so that it
<br>
would grind through and create that single thought.  The machinery is
<br>
still real and is still general machinery - there are no &quot;rigged demo&quot;
<br>
points where someone went in and actually wrote special-case code. 
<br>
However, &quot;choreographed&quot; means that you can pick out in advance what you
<br>
want the thought to be, which preprogrammed symbols are put together in
<br>
which preprogrammed thought structure, and then proceed to debug the
<br>
system as the thought fires - debug the modalities that the symbols fire
<br>
into, debug problems in the creation of mental imagery, and so on.  In
<br>
other words, &quot;choreography&quot; implies that you construct a general mechanism
<br>
and then sweat for a while to get it to work in a particular instance.
<br>
<p>This is where it gets complicated.  The next milestone tracks are:
<br>
<p>3.  Symbol formation.
<br>
4.  Symbol structures (thoughts).
<br>
5.  Thought triggering and deliberation.
<br>
<p>The symbol milestones are:
<br>
<p>3a. Several preprogrammed symbols exist, created by hand-coding the symbol
<br>
content.  An example might be creating the symbol &quot;three billiard balls&quot;
<br>
by using the retrieval of a memory prototype and a unique correspondence
<br>
operation along the lines described in GISAI under &quot;Concepts&quot;.  This
<br>
symbol would be capable of perception, prototype retrieval, and
<br>
application.
<br>
3b. Once you have a symbol for &quot;three billiard balls&quot;, you'd want to work
<br>
up to describing &quot;three sets of four billiard balls&quot;, cross-modality
<br>
symbols, and other ways of perceiving cardinality (for example, counting).
<br>
3c. Once you have &quot;three&quot; and &quot;four&quot;, try handcoding a symbol for
<br>
&quot;number&quot;.
<br>
3d1. Delete the symbol for &quot;three&quot; and try to get a choreographed symbol
<br>
formation for &quot;three billiard balls&quot;.
<br>
3d2. Get a non-choreographed symbol formation for three billiard balls by
<br>
deleting the symbol and placing the AI in a model world where the
<br>
formation of that symbol is obvious and useful.
<br>
3d3. Get a choreographed symbol formation for &quot;three billiard balls&quot;
<br>
followed by a choreographed symbol formation for &quot;three&quot;.
<br>
3d4. Get a model-world true symbol formation for &quot;three billiard balls&quot;
<br>
followed by &quot;three&quot;.
<br>
3e. Get a true symbol formation of &quot;number&quot;.
<br>
<p>Assuming 3a, the thought milestones are:
<br>
<p>4a. The repertoire is expanded from a single choreographed thought to a
<br>
set of several choreographed structures which include some free
<br>
variables.  That is, thoughts with &quot;a b X d Y f&quot;, where X and Y can have
<br>
multiple values selected from a store of preprogrammed symbols.
<br>
4b. The set of choreographed structures containing variables is large
<br>
enough that, by filling in the variables, it is possible to represent
<br>
complex sequences of thoughts that sort of resemble plans or descriptions,
<br>
albeit plans or descriptions of the &quot;See Spot run&quot; type.
<br>
4c. Choreographed larger structures are no longer necessary and local
<br>
rules are sufficient; thoughts have the same freedom as, say, grammatical
<br>
sentences.  Thought is now up and running as new symbols are formed.
<br>
<p>Assuming 4a, the deliberation milestones are:
<br>
<p>5a. A single choreographed &quot;thought trigger&quot; occurs, in which
<br>
choreographed mental imagery undergoes a choreographed binding to a
<br>
triggered thought.  This means that the cognitive system choreographedly
<br>
selects a thought structure, choreographedly fills in the variables with
<br>
appropriate symbols, and fires the thought, thus altering the current
<br>
mental imagery.
<br>
5b. A choreographed thought sequence occurs.
<br>
5c. Real sequences of thoughts occur, although the thoughts may be
<br>
composed of precreated structures with a few free variables.  Deliberation
<br>
is now up and running as thought milestones move through 3b, 3c, et
<br>
cetera.
<br>
<p>Note that further milestones for each of the tracks can be carried out
<br>
using only the first milestones of each of the others.  The actual
<br>
milestones are more likely to run in reverse of the order given here; 5c
<br>
before 4c, 4c before 3c, and 3e being extremely difficult.
<br>
<p>This all gets you to the first phase of general intelligence.
<br>
<p>I've left out memory formation, memory retrieval, the sensory modalities,
<br>
distinguishing between factual and subjunctive and goal imagery, and,
<br>
well, whole bunches of stuff.  I've left out quite a few things that need
<br>
to happen before milestones 1 and 2.
<br>
<p>My guess is that you can teach an AI to play tic-tac-toe at milestone
<br>
levels 5c+4a+3b (optimistic) or 5c+4b+3d2.
<br>
<p>All this assumes, grinding away in the background, nondeliberative
<br>
heuristics-improving-heuristics a la Eurisko.  At stage 5c+4b+3b, you can
<br>
start using thoughts in a lot of places where you used to use Flare
<br>
codelets.  At stage 5c+4b+3c, the thoughts start to be a little
<br>
intelligent and a little adaptive.  At stage 5c+4c+3c, you can get some
<br>
serious intelligence and occasional creativity.  At 5c+4c+3e, you move on
<br>
to the next phase of the great endeavor, which is fleshing in the general
<br>
intelligence and getting the AI to drop from Flare into machine code.  (By
<br>
the time the AI drops into machine code *or* displays significant
<br>
creativity in self-modelling, the AI *must* be *structurally* complete
<br>
with respect to Friendliness.  Ideally this occurs much sooner, before
<br>
general intelligence is structurally complete.)
<br>
<p>The next great endeavor after the drop into machine code is essentially
<br>
the Singularity.  Once the AI has dropped into self-created machine code,
<br>
the remaining work begins to look more like teaching and less like
<br>
programming.  The undirected work at this stage is teaching whatever you
<br>
know or whatever the AI asks you for; the directed work consists of
<br>
bringing the AI's skills at understanding design, cognition, and for lack
<br>
of a better word &quot;philosophy&quot;, up to human levels.
<br>
<p>So there are, as I currently see it, essentially three stages:
<br>
<p>I)    The reach for general intelligence.  Unintelligent
<br>
self-modification.
<br>
II)   The reach for self-modification that makes use of general
<br>
intelligence; self-understanding of design; the drop into machine code.
<br>
III)  Bringing skills (especially design-related skills) up to human
<br>
levels, and/or acquisition of additional hardware computing power, until
<br>
Singularity is reached.
<br>
<p>The word &quot;hard takeoff&quot; means that the AI has begun climbing a
<br>
self-improvement curve which does not require significant additional human
<br>
input and which does not halt until human intelligence has been
<br>
transcended by a significant margin.  The phrase &quot;hard takeoff&quot; does NOT
<br>
refer to what happens as soon as the AI starts modifying its own code or
<br>
completes stage II or whatever.  It *might* turn out to happen that way
<br>
but that is *not* the definition of &quot;hard takeoff&quot;.  By the time the hard
<br>
takeoff starts you should be FINISHED with Friendly AI and, if not, you
<br>
MUST have finished a controlled ascent subgoal, a controlled ascent
<br>
programmatic feature if applicable, and structural completeness in
<br>
Friendliness deliberation if at all possible.
<br>
<p>There's a lot of overlap between stages I and II; you start reaching for
<br>
deliberative self-modification before you've achieved structural
<br>
completeness for deliberation.
<br>
<p>Stage III will probably go by more quickly than stages I and II, even if
<br>
it should involve more human input in an absolute sense, because it can be
<br>
very high-level input rather than programming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a true-conservative perspective, it should be assumed that real
</em><br>
humanstyle intelligence is achieved during stage III as the result of a
<br>
heck of a lot of work.  From a Friendly AI perspective, it should be
<br>
assumed that a hard takeoff could conceivably begin during stage II or
<br>
stage I.  From a free perspective it seems likely that a hard takeoff will
<br>
occur after humanstyle intelligence is achieved but significantly before
<br>
human-*equivalent* intelligence is achieved.
<br>
<p>You can get structurally complete Friendly AI during stage I, but it won't
<br>
have much real content.  (You can do a real, grounded controlled ascent
<br>
subgoal, though.)  Most of the technical stuff in &quot;Creating Friendly AI&quot;
<br>
can be done in a fairly early AI system if you're going for structure
<br>
instead of real content.
<br>
<p>I know how to do a lot of things that should be *sufficient* for a hard
<br>
takeoff.  The problem is that I don't know if they're *necessary*.  AIs
<br>
have an awful lot of advantages humans lack.  Just because humans do X,
<br>
and general intelligence is impossible without X, and I know how to build
<br>
X, and I haven't done X yet, it doesn't mean I can safely say &quot;A hard
<br>
takeoff won't happen until we do X&quot;.
