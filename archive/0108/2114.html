<em>&gt;What is there to trade?  Information, code, personal services (teaching,

</em><br>
<p>What kind of information/code can you not get from the Sysop? Wouldn't the 
<br>
Sysop be the best journalist or provide the best entertainment/art?
<br>
If a human made a great painting, you could always tell the Sysop to 
<br>
replicate one for you.
<br>
<p>Security? The primary goal of the Sysop is security. What use would a 
<br>
bodyguard have if no one can harm you? If you want to learn something, who 
<br>
would be the best teacher? A human or a Superintelligence? And frankly, if 
<br>
you are so extremely shy that you need to PAY people to talk to you, the 
<br>
Sysop kan kindly ask your permission to rewire some basic social skills into 
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>Who would pay for a device constructed by a (trans)human when he can get a 
<br>
superior device for free? What do you mean by trading space? How many cubic 
<br>
light-years do you need? For what? Why would there be a shortage of space?
<br>
<p>The only truly valuable thing post-singularity is probably only matter and 
<br>
energy, or only energy if you consider E=mc^2, and so far I cannot see 
<br>
anything that you would want to trade your share of energy for. If you want 
<br>
something material, you simply use your share of energy to construct it. If 
<br>
you want a service, you ask the Sysop. If you want some fun, you go play 
<br>
with your friends, or have the Sysop replicate you a sex-kitten or 
<br>
something.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economy of abundance, the creation of new types of services is &gt;endless.
</em><br>
<p>That's what abundance is all about...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;live outside Santa Fe. You would not believe the number of massage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;therapists, personal trainers, aroma therapists, not to mention artists, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;live in the area.  Why wouldn't the singularity just increase the &gt;types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;services you might want to consume?
</em><br>
<p>The number of services is increased, but you can get all of them for free at 
<br>
Sysop Inc.
<br>
<p>If someone likes to perform aroma therapy so much that he wants to spend his 
<br>
time doing this, why would he piss off his customers by CHARGING them for 
<br>
it?
