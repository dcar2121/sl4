<em>&gt; From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=RE:%20One%20for%20the%20history%20books">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have made the decision to go for one hundred point zero 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero percent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; altruism and complete rationality.  The decision is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; synonymous with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the achievement, but is a necessary precondition of that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achievement.  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; make a deliberate compromise is to halt your progress at that point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because even the best you can achieve and the most ambitious form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sanity you can imagine is only another step on a long road 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; next single step is visible at any given time.  There are a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emotions that could act as sources of mental energy for my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; work, the desire for fame among them.  The excuse is there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use it.  I do not so choose.  I choose to relinquish those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than compromise rationality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may choose, have the will, or the volition, to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely altruistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rational, but so long as you have a conciousness and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sub-conciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your concious self will still have less than total control 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over your whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self. Your neural pathways are hard-wired to make emotionally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signals, and if you did somehow manage to re-train or re-wire 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true rationality, surely your self would cease to be human? Would a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman be free of emotions? Would a Sysop think it is in our best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests to be 100% altruistic and rational?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheers,
</em><br>

<p>I haven't posted here before, I've enjoyed lurking and listening, mostly
<br>
because I didn't have a lot to add to the technical discussions. But this
<br>
one crosses over into an area I can at least comment on.
<br>
<p>I don't have a degree in Objectivist philosophy, but from what I've read,
<br>
the concepts from that view are that if ones thoughts are rational, then one
<br>
understands that feelings are the RESULT of cognition, not the cause. This
<br>
doesn't mean that one shouldn't have emotions, but that they are not
<br>
primary. If one is logical, then ones thoughts and emotions don't conflict.
<br>
If you lose value, you are sad. If you gain value, then your happy (I'm not
<br>
talking about money per se as value here), a entities value system is
<br>
something it needs to discover, evolve, and adapt. Its going to be
<br>
impossible to program in this meta-behavior and morality if we haven't fully
<br>
worked out the details of it for use by humans yet. Example: I would say
<br>
that its impossible to use altruism as a leading goal and still be rational,
<br>
mainly because I believe altruism to be irrational. Trying to design a mind
<br>
to operate like that may not be possible at all if these are opposing
<br>
factors. An SI would be doomed to insanity, or quickly figure out that its
<br>
life is worth something and has value, then wonder why everyone else's life
<br>
merits more value then its. Best bet as I see it is to find the most
<br>
logically consistent philosophy to feed into it and just try to be as good a
<br>
friend to it as possible. Minds deal with thoughts, thoughts are concepts
<br>
framed in particular contexts, and the totality of these contexts make up a
<br>
entity's philosophy. Trying to program a particular thought out of context
<br>
either wont &quot;hold&quot; or will lead to instability in further thought
<br>
development.
