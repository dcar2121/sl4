<p>I doubt it.  Any mind that has the slightest use for what you or I wrote
<br>
is too primitive to even begin thinking about defining Sysop Space. 
<br>
(&quot;Unix Reality&quot;?)  The Transition Guide might share some of the causes
<br>
that moved us to write, but the writing itself as an influence?  No way. 
<br>
I'd have to veto that - in fact, if we're hypothesizing that an FAI is
<br>
rummaging through the SL4 archives, I just did.  &lt;smile&gt;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Refine the design using the coding heuristics (vis codic cortex?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ve has developed.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I think this presumes too little intelligence.  &quot;Solve all the
<br>
design problems in negligible time through the use of enormously
<br>
superhuman intelligence beyond our ability to comprehend or even describe
<br>
as a cognitive process&quot; is probably a better way of putting it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Develop a system (whatever it may actually be, probably something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the Sysop, or maybe you might call it Unix for the Singularity).
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Unix Reality&quot; is the best phrase I've been able to come up with so far...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Stress test it in simulation (yes, this will be the same as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real thing, the AI should have the ability to do this).
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Testing&quot; is a paradigm for evolution and slow/parallel/linear minds. 
<br>
Based on my theoretical understanding of how the regularities in reality
<br>
operate, my guess is that testing will become an inefficient use of
<br>
cognitive resources not too far past the point where it is possible to
<br>
cognitively model each lowest-level element in what is being tested. 
<br>
Think of Deep Blue versus Kasparov - Deep Blue tested actual chess
<br>
positions and Kasparov thought *about* chess positions, which is why they
<br>
were evenly matched when Deep Blue was processing 2 billion positions per
<br>
second to Kasparov's 2 positions per second.  Basically, thinking of
<br>
actual realities is a very inefficient way to think, and creating actual
<br>
realities is even worse.  The only reason for it would be to catch unknown
<br>
unknowns that were hypothesized to act with respect to a physical test,
<br>
but not with respect to an imaged test.  Humans, of course, do not have
<br>
the ability to run low-level simulations and must thus always resort to
<br>
physical tests.
