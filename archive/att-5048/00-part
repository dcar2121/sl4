Eliezer Yudkowsky should have a basket named SL3 (and maybe SL2 also).

Many posts should go there. More than half of those here.

Mike's posts have their own value. So what, if they were in SL3, if Yudkowsky decides so?

It looks to me, like a good man was lost. Instead it was just said: "Okay Mike, this story of yours has a weak point here and there."
