Hi there,
<br>
I decided to go along with Eliezer Yudkowsky's suggested custom of new
<br>
members
<br>
introducing themselves. So I will.
<br>
<p>My name is Joel Pitt, I'm studying towards a Computer Science (honours)
<br>
degree
<br>
at Canterbury University in New Zealand. It's my first year at Uni (and away
<br>
from home
<br>
for that matter), but I've graciously been allowed to do direct entry to the
<br>
2nd stage
<br>
courses so that the degree will take me only 3 rather then 4 years.
<br>
<p>I got an A Bursary, although that probably doesn't mean much to anyone
<br>
outside of
<br>
New Zealand, and I have grown up surrounded by computers all my life. I
<br>
started
<br>
programming at about 7 (I always had to do some programming before I was
<br>
allowed
<br>
to play games... hehe), and my Dad currently works as a software educator.
<br>
<p>I've been interested in technology all my life, I've recently been
<br>
interested in ALife
<br>
and that invariably led to me getting interested in AI and neural nets. I
<br>
also like
<br>
to think of myself as being SL4, but its kind of difficult not to be biased
<br>
when rating
<br>
yourself.
<br>
<p>Night all, It's late and about time I get some sleep. Even though the middle
<br>
of  the night
<br>
seems to be when my brain is most active.
<br>
<p>I look forward to doing my part towards the singularity. :-)
<br>
<p>Joel.
