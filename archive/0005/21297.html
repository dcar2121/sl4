I do believe it just might be crazy enough to work! I shall get to work
<br>
on it immediately.
<br>
Thanks

Here's an amusing story a friend of mine passed on to me. I thought 
<br>
it worth sharing even though it is off topic:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
An American magazine held a competition, inviting its readers to 
<br>
submit new scientific theories on ANY subject.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Below is the winner:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Subject: Perpetual Motion
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet, and when toast is
<br>
dropped, it always lands buttered side down.
<br>
<p>Therefore, if a slice of toast is strapped to a cat's back, buttered 
<br>
side up, and the animal is then dropped, the two opposing forces will 
<br>
cause it to hover, spinning inches above the ground. If enough toast-
<br>
laden felines were used, they could form the basis of a high-speed 
<br>
monorail system.&quot;
<br>
<p>........but this idea got this reply from one of the readers....
<br>
<p>QUOTE
<br>
<p>I've been thinking about this cat/toast business for a while.
<br>
<p>In the buttered toast case, it's the butter that causes it to land
<br>
buttered side down - it doesn't have to be toast, the theory works 
<br>
equally well with Jacob's crackers.
<br>
<p>So to save money I think you just miss out the toast - and butter the
<br>
cats.
<br>
<p>Also, should there be an imbalance between the effects of cat and 
<br>
butter, there are other substances that have a stronger affinity for 
<br>
carpet.
<br>
Consider that the probability of carpet impact is determined by the
<br>
following simple formula:
<br>
<p>P = S * t(t)/tc
<br>
<p>where P is the probability of carpet impact, and S is the &quot;stain&quot; 
<br>
value of the toast-covering substance - an indicator of the 
<br>
effectiveness of the topping in permanently staining the carpet.
<br>
<p>Chicken Tikka Masala, for example, has a very high S value, while the 
<br>
S value of water is zero.
<br>
<p>tc and t(t) indicate the tone of the carpet and topping respectively -
<br>
the value of P being strongly related to the relationship between the
<br>
colour of the carpet and topping, as even chicken tikka masala won't 
<br>
cause a permanent and obvious stain if the carpet is the same colour.
<br>
<p>So it is clear that the probability of carpet impact is maximised if 
<br>
you use chicken tikka masala and a white carpet - in fact this 
<br>
combination gives a P value of one, which is the same as the 
<br>
probability of a cat landing on its feet. Therefore a cat with 
<br>
chicken tikka masala plastered on its back will be certain to hover 
<br>
in mid air.  
<br>
<p>Contrastingly, therecould be problems with buttered toast as the 
<br>
toast may fall off the cat, causing a terrible monorail crash 
<br>
resulting in nauseating images of members of the royal family 
<br>
visiting accident victims in hospital, and politicians saying it 
<br>
wouldn't have happened if their party was in power as there would 
<br>
have been more investment in cat-toast glue research.
<br>
<p>Therefore it is in the interests not only of public safety but also 
<br>
public sanity if the buttered toast on cats idea is scrapped, to be 
<br>
replaced by a monorail powered by cats smeared with chicken tikka 
<br>
masala floating above a rail made from white wool shag pile carpet.
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
Dale Johnstone.
