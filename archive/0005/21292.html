<p>
Professor Hugo de Garis, physicist, lately of Melbourne and now of Kyoto
<br>
in Japan, fears that his experiments may ultimately lead to the
<br>
extermination of the human race. What do you think? 
<br>
<p>At the Kyoto Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute, Professor
<br>
de Garis switched on a machine with which he will build the world's
<br>
first neural circuits for a true artificial brain. 
<br>
In the next 12 months the cellular automata machine (CAM) in his
<br>
laboratory will create a device composed of 75million silicon neurons,
<br>
similar in capability to those in a human brain. 
<br>
<p>The neuron networks are built up so that their connections are random,
<br>
as they 
<br>
are in the human brain. Most of them fail in production and are
<br>
discarded by a 
<br>
system based on Darwin's theory of evolution. Even so, the circuits are
<br>
built, 
<br>
tested, accepted or rejected at blinding speed, many thousands every
<br>
minute. 
<br>
When it is finished some time in 2001, this artificial brain or
<br>
&quot;artilect&quot; will 
<br>
go into a four-legged robot called Robokitty. 
<br>
<p>By then work will have begun on the next generation of the artificial
<br>
brain which, Professor de Garis says, could be finished about 2007 and
<br>
would have more 
<br>
than 10 billion neurons. This would bring it to about the level of a
<br>
village idiot but within reach of the 23billion organic neurons
<br>
contained in the cortex 
<br>
of a human male (19 billion in a female). 
<br>
Then comes the third generation, which Professor de Garis expects to be
<br>
finished 
<br>
about 2011 - a fearsome creation of 1000 billion neurons, vastly larger
<br>
than that 
<br>
of a human. 
<br>
<p>&quot;By then,&quot; says this unconventional Australian, &quot;I expect we'll be in a
<br>
debate 
<br>
about whether we should proceed any further. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Long-term I am very worried about the political impact of brain
<br>
building. 
<br>
&quot;Since I am helping to pioneer this brain-building field, I feel a
<br>
strong moral 
<br>
obligation to stimulate discussion on this enormous question. Do we
<br>
allow the 
<br>
artificial intellects to take over or not?&quot; 
<br>
Futurologists, such as the American computer engineer and author Ray
<br>
Kurzweil, agree with him. While they themselves are riding and driving
<br>
the technological revolution, they also see its scary side. A massively
<br>
powerful artificial brain could easily develop contempt for its
<br>
comparatively puny human makers, says Professor de Garis, who predicts
<br>
that such a question could be this century's burning issue. 
<br>
<p>On one side will be those afraid of the consequences of the science. On
<br>
the other those who see it as part of human destiny and who say that if
<br>
artilects 
<br>
are created by humans, then humans can set the boundaries for the
<br>
artificial intelligence. 
<br>
<p>Professor de Garis is not so sure about humans retaining control,
<br>
particularly 
<br>
when it comes to a silicon brain 40 times smarter than your average man.
<br>
These, 
<br>
he says, should be coming out of the CAM machines by the second half of
<br>
this century. 
<br>
<p>Some see parallels with the debate raised by the cloning of Dolly the
<br>
sheep. 
<br>
The CAM machine with which Professor deGaris is working was built by
<br>
Genobyte, a US company based in Boulder, Colorado. It produces
<br>
microscopic modules on silicon chips each of about 1000 artificial
<br>
neurons. Such electrical connections in our human brains control our
<br>
movements, our senses and, perhaps most ominously when it is seen in an
<br>
artificial environment, our emotions and our imaginations. 
<br>
<p>In his profile on his personal website, the professor says: &quot;My dream in
<br>
life is 
<br>
to build artificial brains with billions of artificial neurons, and see
<br>
brain-like computers become a trillion-dollar industry within 20 years.&quot;
