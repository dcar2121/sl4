On Sun, Mar 13, 2011 at 1:00 PM, Gwern Branwen &lt;<a href="mailto:gwern0@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Re:%20META:%20closing%20the%20list">gwern0@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; In 2010, there were a grand total of 144 emails on SL4, or less than 1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email every 2 days. Looking through <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/">http://sl4.org/archive/</a> , most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those emails seem to be joins, link posting, or announcements. The SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home page claims that 'The SL4 list currently has around 200 members.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Usual volume is five to ten messages per day, with occasional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervals of pleasant silence, and flurries of high activity.' but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect both sentences are drastic over-estimations now.
</em><br>
<p>To follow up; it has been almost 2 months since I sent this email. In
<br>
the 3 list archive periods for that month
<br>
(<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/1103/index.html">http://sl4.org/archive/1103/index.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/1104/index.html">http://sl4.org/archive/1104/index.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/1105/index.html">http://sl4.org/archive/1105/index.html</a>), there have been exactly *9*
<br>
emails unrelated to my list closure suggestion. (I think, anyway. I'm
<br>
not sure whether the archives are not broken, since I didn't see some
<br>
of the emails it claims were sent about the list closure, and the last
<br>
email on record, <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/1105/21134.html">http://sl4.org/archive/1105/21134.html</a> , links to a
<br>
2000 email as the 'next message'!) Of those 9 emails, at least 3 were
<br>
simply announcements or pointers to announcements elsewhere; at least
<br>
2 were vapid and added nothing; and &lt;3 were simply offtopic or of
<br>
entirely questionable relevance. One would think that proposing the
<br>
equivalent of the death sentence for a mailing list would stir a
<br>
little more traffic...
<br>
<p>In an interesting comment on my original email, it was forwarded to
<br>
the Extropy-chat ML, where it met with no public reply of any kind:
<br>
<a href="http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2011-March/064738.html">http://lists.extropy.org/pipermail/extropy-chat/2011-March/064738.html</a>
<br>
<p>In that 2 month-long period, incidentally, Extropy-chat has seen
<br>
approximately 1800 emails. LW has seen approximately 128 Articles
<br>
(<a href="http://lesswrong.com/recentposts">http://lesswrong.com/recentposts</a>), approximately 322 Discussion
<br>
posts*, and it's more than a little difficult to calculate this but
<br>
around *14,000* comments†. MoR, with a few updates, has received an
<br>
additional &gt;504 reviews in that period‡. Robin Hanson now posting
<br>
alone on OB has &gt;50 posts since March 13th or so, and with what looks
<br>
like an average of 20-30 comments per posting, &gt;1000 comments! Hell,
<br>
my own personal site has had more comments in the past few days(some
<br>
fairly substantial, eg. <a href="http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity">http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20Anonymity</a>)
<br>
than SL4 has had emails in the past 2 months.
<br>
<p>To re-mention <a href="http://becominggaia.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/uber-rationalists-call-for-shutdown-of-sl4-list/">http://becominggaia.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/uber-rationalists-call-for-shutdown-of-sl4-list/</a>
<br>
says that SL4 is useful for &quot;Shuttering SL4 would be a huge loss —
<br>
unless you need to restrict and control the conversation.&quot;; I will
<br>
note that he has not posted once in the past 2 months besides the list
<br>
closure thread.
<br>
<p>To summarize: *no one is using SL4*. If a ML is not being used, why
<br>
should it remain active?
<br>
<p>Now. I could keep this up for the indefinite future, posting
<br>
statistics about how other sites are literally 1000x more active than
<br>
SL4 is. But if all the points I have presented are insufficient, then
<br>
it's hard to see why simply repeating them with slight variations as
<br>
the statistics change would make them sufficient. I'm done; my case
<br>
has been presented. I'll stick around for a month for whatever is left
<br>
to discuss, and then unsubscribe - voting with my feet, as it were.

† Since 8 May began, there have been ~400 comments proper, judging
<br>
from how far back I had to go to reach 7 May comments:
<br>
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/comments/?count=350&amp;after=t1_44d7">http://lesswrong.com/comments/?count=350&amp;after=t1_44d7</a>oday is 9
<br>
May. Assume just 150 Article comments a day, and undercounting to get
<br>
56 days, that's 8400 comments. Discussion seems to have a lower rate
<br>
of around 100 comments a day judging from
<br>
<a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/comments?count=200&amp;after=t1_44fy">http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/comments?count=200&amp;after=t1_44fy</a><br>
so that adds on another 5600.

March reviews start showing up
