<p>
Dear Sirs,
<br>
<p>In the last couple of days, we have deeply analyzed the scenario in 
<br>
which we are and from almost every point of view. Also, we have mainly 
<br>
deeply analyzed the reactions that our written communications could have 
<br>
produced in the audience.
<br>
First of all, let us explain that there is a *very very big 
<br>
misundertanding*, but this misunderstanding in not attributable to us. 
<br>
We think that the main reason is the possible impact of our AGI work in 
<br>
the AGI world.
<br>
Let us better explain our viewpoint.
<br>
The AGI world is not a world in which there are many financial resources 
<br>
(you can read Ben Goerztel declarations about that).
<br>
For example, if someone ask to us &quot;Why invest in AGI?&quot;, our response is: 
<br>
&quot;because AGI is a very positive invention&quot;.
<br>
When we said that &quot;anybody today can practically demonstrate to possess 
<br>
an AGI could worth ...&quot;, we don't speak of economic (or financial) 
<br>
value, but we speak of a scientific value in perspective and for all 
<br>
people (this is the only meaning, not others).
<br>
Therefore, if we meet a potential investor in any place (on the train, 
<br>
on the beach, on the mountains, or anywhere), we could explain to him 
<br>
that our AGI is only positive (there is no negative aspects in our AGI).
<br>
Furthermore, we could explain to a potential investor that he should not 
<br>
invest his time with machiavellians people (we are not machiavellians) 
<br>
that are only negative people (this is an italian &quot;idiom&quot; that 
<br>
demonstrate only our *high personal esteem* towards any potential investor).
<br>
Regarding our strategy, we don't have affirmed in any place that we want 
<br>
to necessarily build a supercompany (we are always been opened to many 
<br>
solutions).
<br>
<p>We hope that this explanation definitively clarify our intentions once 
<br>
and for all.
<br>
Misunterstanding cannot persists forever.
<br>
<p>Best Regards.
<br>
<p>Rick Geniale Enterprises Corp.
