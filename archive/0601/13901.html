<em>&gt; At the inaugural colloquium of the Redwood Neuroscience Institute,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a discussion among some (major, prestigious) computational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscientists about what kind of degree they'd most like to hire. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some said neurology, some said electrical engineering, but then one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person said, &quot;I'd rather have someone with a degree in physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they can learn anything,&quot; and the rest nodded agreement. 
</em><br>
<p>??? -People with a physics degree can learn anything, as opposed to
<br>
people with a degree in neurology or ee? People with a physics degree
<br>
can severely lack in memory, and in social/communication skills.
<br>
Speaking of which, if I were you I'd emphasize the communication skills
<br>
requirement more. Not the &quot;you should be capable of communicating with
<br>
anyone&quot;, but if you want to be part of a team you should be capable of
<br>
communicating well with other members of the team. About technical
<br>
things and about non-technical things. Because someone not being able
<br>
to communicate his annoyance with one of the other team-members and the
<br>
problem hence escalating could be real BAD. Having majored in
<br>
Biomedical Science &amp; Engineering, AI, EE, and Neuroscience at different
<br>
universities for smaller and larger amounts of time makes it real
<br>
obvious to me that in all of the areas you might find people from there
<br>
are tons of people who are severely lacking in people skills (which
<br>
doesn't mean that I wasn't/am not one of them).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important requirement, obviously, is that the one be able to learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything.  It is also indispensable that the one already be a math 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talent, and have some experience programming, because there are some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things I'm not willing to bother teaching.
</em><br>
<p>I'd rather teach a brilliant person math/programming than teach them
<br>
how to communicate, self-control, emotional stability, etc. That said,
<br>
I agree that math/programming is extremely important. Now, a brilliant
<br>
person should be capable of learning all the prerequisite
<br>
math/programming on his own without much help from anyone, but that
<br>
doesn't mean you should hire someone who doesn't meet those prereqs. I
<br>
thought the article was alright, it said way too much obvious stuff for
<br>
me, but knowing normal intelligent people I think that that's likely to
<br>
be necessary.
