</em><br>
<em>&gt; The seed AI programmer described &amp;/or implied in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the world today, but perhaps not with a probability of zero.  And
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&quot;Should we alter the entry requirements to be less stringent?&quot;
<br>
<p>While we're at it, let's alter the task to be less difficult.  Also 
<br>
let's change the speed of light so we can get to Andromeda faster.
<br>
<p>The article is indeed not politically correct; it was written in a rush, 
<br>
originally on the SL4 Wiki, in between doing other things.
<br>
<p>If today I were rewriting the actual content of the article, rather than 
<br>
the tone, I would emphasize mathematics, mathematical logic, decision 
<br>
theory, probability theory, and above all, sheer raw fluid intelligence, 
<br>
aka g-factor.  Marcello doesn't have a solid background in mathematical 
<br>
logic or decision theory, which is probably the next nearest neighbor to 
<br>
the problems we are currently discussing.  (For that matter, *I* don't 
<br>
have a solid background in mathematical logic or decision theory.)  But 
<br>
Marcello competes at the national level at programming, and has overall 
<br>
studied more math than I have.  So when I say, &quot;If utility functions are 
<br>
unique up to a positive affine transformation, what does that actually 
<br>
preserve?&quot; Marcello says &quot;Relative size of intervals&quot; and then I say, 
<br>
&quot;Oh, of course&quot; and proceed to describe what this means about the 
<br>
structure of utility functions.  Now, Marcello probably(?) would not 
<br>
have independently realized what preserving the relative size of 
<br>
intervals means about the structure of utility functions, at that point 
<br>
in his career.  And if I hadn't asked the question, Marcello might not 
<br>
have realized that it was an important question to ask, at that point in 
<br>
his career.  Marcello still needs a lot of ancillary experience and 
<br>
principle before he can help steer the bicycle, not just help pedal it. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Marcello can keep up his end of the conversation, rather than just 
<br>
staring at me blankly.  As most AGI wannabes would, if I asked what a 
<br>
positive affine transformation preserves.
<br>
<p>At the inaugural colloquium of the Redwood Neuroscience Institute, there 
<br>
was a discussion among some (major, prestigious) computational 
<br>
neuroscientists about what kind of degree they'd most like to hire. 
<br>
Some said neurology, some said electrical engineering, but then one 
<br>
person said, &quot;I'd rather have someone with a degree in physics, because 
<br>
they can learn anything,&quot; and the rest nodded agreement.  The most 
<br>
important requirement, obviously, is that the one be able to learn 
<br>
anything.  It is also indispensable that the one already be a math 
<br>
talent, and have some experience programming, because there are some 
<br>
things I'm not willing to bother teaching.
