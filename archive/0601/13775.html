<p>
Rick,
<br>
<p>I do not believe anyone was insulting to you.  Your claims were prima 
<br>
facie implausible, so you should expect some tough questions and it is 
<br>
surely your duty to respond to those questions.  If my words looked 
<br>
insulting, I apologise and ask you to treat my questions as tough, but 
<br>
respectful.
<br>
<p>I must give you a word of advice, too.  If you are genuine and sincere, 
<br>
it might be in your interest NOT to withdraw with protests about being 
<br>
offended, as soon as some questions are asked of you.
<br>
<p>Why?  Because in my experience this kind of behavior (protesting 
<br>
innocence and sincerity, complaining at the offensive nature of the 
<br>
questions, and then departing without giving any answers) is PRECISELY 
<br>
the kind of behavior exhibited by a person who is a fake.
<br>
<p>I do not accuse you of being a fake.  Sadly, however, we do not yet have 
<br>
any evidence that you know what you are talking about - so please help 
<br>
us to understand by giving us some evidence that can convince us that 
<br>
you do understand the AGI field and have actually built an AGI.

</em><br>
