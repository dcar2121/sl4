<p>
If the following test were given to humans, who most humans would consider
<br>
intelligent (not necessarily extremely intelligent), how many humans would
<br>
pass?
<br>
<p>I would NOT pass the test you propose so therefore I would NOT be
<br>
intelligent according to your test?  Is this reasonable?
<br>
<p>I would propose another kind of test.  Propose some questions that an
<br>
average human could answer correctly a large percentage of the time.
<br>
Exclude all questions that would be specific to human beings or our physical
<br>
experience.  Exclude all questions that require a context that only humans
<br>
would be knowledgeable of. (The Turing test is obviously a very human biased
<br>
test of intelligence if that was the purpose of it being proposed.)  Make
<br>
sure that all the questions, if answered incorrectly, show a lack of
<br>
intelligence as the reason for the incorrect answer rather than a lack of
<br>
knowledge of our culture or our creations (including Math).  Many minorities
<br>
get low IQ scores in the US because of the cultural bias that exists in most
<br>
IQ tests.  They argue that IQ tests don't accurately reflect their
<br>
intelligence because IQ tests test knowledge (not intelligence) which can be
<br>
different among different groups.  There is also the problem of having
<br>
different kinds of intelligence. (Musical IQ, Reasoning IQ, Math IQ etc)
<br>
<p>If a program (software, hardware or some combination) then successfully
<br>
answers these questions then we should assume that it has some intelligence
<br>
similar to what some humans have.  Why should human level intelligence
<br>
assume University or greater knowledge in an esoteric field like physics?
<br>
Most people that walk the streets don't have this kind of knowledge so why
<br>
should that be a criteria for intelligence?
<br>
<p>I agree that intelligence doesn't imply consciousness.

<p><p><em>&gt; What I am interested in is WHETHER YOUR SYSTEM IS INTELLIGENT.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to know if you think it is going to talk (with a voice?) in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that it clearly knows what it is talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To ensure that you don't cheat, I propose the following test.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will ask your machine several questions.  These will be designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretch it to the limits of its cognitive powers.  The first set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions I will give you now, so your machine has time to prepare.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Others must be answered in real time, and they will be of a similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; character as these.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Give an introduction to Heim's theory of quantum gravity, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient detail to allow a Physics graduate to understand it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) You are living in a hovel in northern England some time in the Dark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ages, and when you open your door and look outside one morning, you hear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fragment of a T.S. Eliot poem come to you (suitably translated into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your vernacular) through a time warp.  You smile with recognition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Explain why you smiled, what you heard and what the context is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) Might Igor Stravinsky have had any opinion on the subject of motor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scooters?  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When the remaining questions are asked in real time, your machine will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be required to respond in any human language that is currently spoken by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than 1 million people.  I will specify which language, but I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give only one second's notice of the language.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regards
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richard Loosemore.
