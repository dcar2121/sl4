<br>
<p>Yes this is a startling claim, especially for builders of such conscious
<br>
machines or &quot;Real AI&quot; such as am I. The world seems to be suddenly changing
<br>
quickly, and where before I felt like I had plenty of time, now it appears
<br>
time is quickly growing short. Here is a quote from their website, stating
<br>
I believe their central claim ...
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Rick Geniale Enterprises Corp. is the company that has realized PIBOT, the
<br>
**first ever existed &quot;Real AI&quot;** in the human history on the Earth Planet.
<br>
...
<br>
Wherever inside this web site there is a reference to the concept of &quot;Real
<br>
AI&quot;, that concept describes an enormous set of software algorithms that,
<br>
taken in its vastness and entireness, is able to manifest a series of
<br>
complex abilities that belong to any intelligent human being. Such
<br>
abilities includes mainly: general intelligence, &quot;good sense&quot;,
<br>
autoconsciousness, autonomy, cognition, perception, decision, action.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p>Many people refer to these humanlike, intelligent machines as conscious
<br>
machines. The major and (brand new) scholarly website for machine
<br>
consciousness is 
<br>
<a href="http://www.machineconsciousness.org/">http://www.machineconsciousness.org/</a>  operated by Owen Holland at the Univ.
<br>
of Essex  ( <a href="http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/holland.htm">http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/holland.htm</a>. ) He works in
<br>
conjunction with Igor Aleksander who of course developed the Five Axioms of
<br>
Consciousness. (
<br>
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1029052,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1029052,00.html</a> )
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Guardian article ... 
</em><br>
Holland and Aleksander have been given the biggest ever grant to build a
<br>
&quot;conscious robot&quot;. The work will not only bring the scores of intelligent,
<br>
self-aware machines that populate science fiction a step closer, it could
<br>
also provide valuable clues on how human consciousness develops. ... 
<br>
&quot;Consciousness is perhaps the last remaining mystery in understanding what
<br>
it is to be human,&quot; said Owen Holland, who will lead the work at Essex
<br>
University. &quot;By attempting to build physical systems which can produce a
<br>
form of artificial consciousness, we hope to learn more about the nature of
<br>
consciousness.&quot;
<br>
<p>A leading journal for machine consciousness is the Journal of Consciousness
<br>
Studies  ( <a href="http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs.html">http://www.imprint.co.uk/jcs.html</a> ).
<br>
<p>So this is a small glimpse the current state of the art for machine
<br>
consciousness. My point is, whether we call it a conscious machine, &quot;Real
<br>
AI,&quot; strong AI, or AGI, we are all talking about the same class of
<br>
phenomenon.
<br>
<p>So here is where it gets interesting because PIBOT claims to be the **first
<br>
ever existing Real AI.**  Well, that makes three groups that I am aware of
<br>
making this claim for the **first ever humanlike, intelligent machine.**
<br>
One of them is me, as the List knows. Another well-organized and
<br>
interesting contender is the Rosens at Machine Consciousness Inc. (
<br>
<a href="http://www.mcon.org/">http://www.mcon.org/</a> ). They too are planning a big 2006 roll out, as am I
<br>
and PIBOT. So the ground is starting to shake. The Rosens claim, as we all
<br>
do, to have invented the first humanlike, intelligent &quot;conscious machine&quot;
<br>
as proven by their 2003 patent.
<br>
<p>So maybe we should gather together a list of all the Contenders claiming to
<br>
have built the first ever humanlike, intelligent machine, which some call
<br>
Real AI, strong AI, AGI, or machine consciousness - 
<br>
1. Artificial Lifeforms Lab LLC - my company, with a 2005 US patent pending
<br>
(60/730340) for a conscious machine called a droid, being an android if
<br>
human shaped or a metadroid if non-human shaped. In both cases they exhibit
<br>
humanlike intelligence, so that we get odd forms of artificial life such as
<br>
the &quot;talking dog&quot; and the &quot;flying man.&quot;
<br>
2. Machine Consciousness Inc. - a company with a 2003 patent for &quot;machine
<br>
consciousness&quot;
<br>
3. PIBOT -  a company with a 2005 claim of building the ** first ever &quot;Real
<br>
AI&quot; **
<br>
<p><p>If anyone knows of any other Contenders I sure would like to know ...
