</em><br>
<p>You're right.
<br>
<p>Here's a higher SL idea to discuss:
<br>
Until now, all ethical systems proposed have implicitly suggested that
<br>
there is one &quot;correct&quot; system of ethics.  This system of ethics
<br>
&quot;should&quot; be followed by all humans.    Other animals, however, are not
<br>
expected to follow this system of ethics.
<br>
<p>In a transhuman world, there will be no human-nohuman-subhuman
<br>
distinction.  Any transhuman ethics must apply also to chimpanzees,
<br>
dogs, and Jupiter brains.
<br>
<p>One might object to saying that a dog &quot;should&quot; follow an ethical code. 
<br>
I would reply that a wolf has a very strong moral code, with precepts
<br>
such as
<br>
<p>- the rights of dominant animals over less dominant ones
<br>
- a set of rules about mating
<br>
- an injunction against killing opponents in the pack during fights
<br>
- rules about how to treat strange wolves
<br>
- rules about how to treat pups (e.g., they are not required to observe
<br>
most of the rules until they're about 1 year of age; one should not nip
<br>
at them if they nip at you)
<br>
<p>One might object that this code is inherited.  Whether this code is
<br>
inherited or learned is unclear, in exactly the same way that it is for
<br>
humans.  There is no distinction on this issue between humans and
<br>
wolves.
<br>
<p>We will need a multitude of ethical codes, because a human can make
<br>
subtle distinctions that a dog can't.  Any code capable of being
<br>
implemented by a dog, could be improved on by a human.
<br>
<p>This immediately suggests that ordinary humans today should use
<br>
different ethical codes, depending on their intelligence.  This is of
<br>
course unacceptable today.
<br>
<p>It also seems obvious to me that the &quot;ethical landscape&quot; is like any
<br>
other fitness landscape, meaning that there are a variety of local
<br>
maxima, which change in accordance with circumstances.
<br>
<p>Thus, &quot;ethics&quot; is like an ecosystem, with many different ethical
<br>
systems that continually adapt to each other's presence.
<br>
<p>One needs a framework for judging ethical codes - probably a
<br>
utilitarian one.  (Mike Vassar says &quot;utilitarian&quot; refers to a subset of
<br>
what I mean by utilitarian, but I've forgotten the details.)  We could
<br>
discuss whose utilities this framework considers - living organisms,
<br>
future organisms, possibly dead organisms (many cultures believe one
<br>
should honor the dead, rather than turning them into Soylent Green) -
<br>
and how one discounts for time, and how one weights utilties to
<br>
different types of organisms (by &quot;IQ&quot;?)
<br>
<p>Two questions for discussion:
<br>
<p>- Doesn't this suggest that any ethical system which has every human
<br>
observing the same ethical code is like an ecosystem containing only
<br>
one type of organism, or like a genetic algorithm that has converged,
<br>
and relies only on mutation for improvement?  In general, more diverse
<br>
ecosystems are more stable and more productive.  This would mean that
<br>
having only one single moral code for everyone is highly immoral.
<br>
<p>-  Can the notion of &quot;niche&quot; be transferred from ecosystems to ethical
<br>
systems?  Does the presence of one moral code create opportunities for
<br>
the presence of different moral codes, which together increase overall
<br>
utility?  Can one then say that a system of ethics is &quot;bad&quot; only if it
<br>
is mostly parasitic, or if it causes instability that tends to lead to
<br>
a lower overall utility (e.g., idealistic moral codes that invite
<br>
invasion by cheaters)?
<br>
<p>- Is it beneficial to impose different ethical systems on a complex
<br>
system's subcomponents?  That is, should a complex personality contain
<br>
a hierarchy of ethical codes, for each of its components?  This
<br>
question could be applied to humans, but is easier to understand if you
<br>
apply it to Jupiter brains.
<br>
<p>- Phil
