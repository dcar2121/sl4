Sry, my criticisms were meant in the context of post-singularity societies.  Shooting birds and eating bacon is fun.  We are very fortunate to have our present levels of social and ethical maturity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't believe me that physical pain is bad and pleasure good, there are very simple control tests you can perform at home to prove this.
<br>
If you eliminate physical suffering (all else equal) you eliminate the negative parts of the universe.  Of course a marathon runner needs to suffer and there are contexts where choosing suffering is fine.  But in the context of a gazelle, it does not need to be eaten by lions to be happy.  The lion to be happy can eat a mechanical gazelle covered by the same tissue growth process that will feed us all in a decade or two.

Err... no. To clarify, I do not justify the physical suffering of wild 
<br>
animals because it doesn't require justification. It would require 
<br>
justification if humans were responsible for causing it, or perhaps if we 
<br>
had a very large amount of control over the situation and had a viable 
<br>
alternative. Post singularity our control may be very high, but I currently 
<br>
cannot imagine a viable alternative to physical suffering that when 
<br>
implemented across an ecosystem leaves it intact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Physical pain is bad. Physical pleasure is good.

Saying it doesn't make it so.

<p><em>&gt; Everything in the universe is derivative of these two

Not in the universe I am inhabiting. But, for the sake of argument, let me 
<br>
take your axioms as true for a moment... if you eliminate physical 
<br>
suffering, wouldn't you eliminate half of everything in the universe?
