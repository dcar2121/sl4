<em>&gt; Eliezer, refusal to answer the question on the grounds that &quot;this

<em>&gt; does not equate to impossibility, and given that we likely live in an
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the question should be confronted.
</em><br>
<p>This to me is exactly NOT what I thought when I read Eliezer's post.
<br>
In my opinion, he is pointing out a very valid problem, but not the
<br>
one you seem to be objecting to. In being a good thinker, we need to
<br>
become very good at discerning the true nature of the facts we have
<br>
available(or at least some approximation of sureness) and then operate
<br>
on the assumption that we've done our diligence.
<br>
<p>However, when people ask hypothetical questions, they are asking you
<br>
to take certain facts as axiomatic, and then reason AS IF you were in
<br>
a normal situation that those axiomatic facts had somehow been imposed
<br>
upon. Many times I refuse to answer hypothetical questions on these
<br>
grounds, because the reasoning very quickly becomes artificial.
<br>
<p>&quot;If good was bad, and hitler was going to kill ghandi, what would you
<br>
do? answer using the moral logic you have developed in an entirely
<br>
different world&quot;
<br>
<p>Hypothetical questions twist your reasoning skills in knots, often in
<br>
very subtle ways, because they mess up how evidence and environment
<br>
act as inputs to your decisions, but are presented as if they are
<br>
'realistic' or approximating realism.
<br>
<p>You can see this in extremis when you watch sci-fi fans trying to
<br>
'explain' the continuity of their favorite show. Given some
<br>
unambigious wierdness they have to take as a starting point, they
<br>
twist themselves into knots trying to make it 'make sense'. You get
<br>
ridiculousness like www.stardestroyer.net, where a poor engineer has
<br>
tried to actually analytically determine the nature of imaginary
<br>
technologies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On a related note, the odds of our surviving the Singularity is likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; akin to the coin flipping scenario offered above. Would you argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we shouldn't anticipate our surviving the Singularity due to its gross
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improbability?
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes. If you actually believe that our likelihood of surviving is
<br>
very low, then you should anticipate whatever scenario is most likely
<br>
and plan for that. If all the likely scenarios are entirely beyond any
<br>
action you may take, then you can plan for less likely scenarios on
<br>
the reasoning that it's the best leverage you have, but it seems
<br>
unlikely that you could determine that.
