Another variety of thread veiw.
<br>
Is that the thread of consciousness, continues through all future entities  
<br>
that you have power over.
<br>
This is basicall;, you are (or you should have moral obligation to) all  
<br>
the future entitys that you have power over.
<br>
<p>So when copy of you is uploaded  since you determined how it would be you,  
<br>
had power over it. An it is you.
<br>
This also means you having control over yourself is desirable is better  
<br>
(we don't have complete control over our minds now).
<br>
<p><p><p>In the patternist veiw , could additive change be different than revisive  
<br>
change, if you became a god by merely adding to your existing self - then  
<br>
would it be you?
<br>
<p>And russel would you veiw a static utopia, where you loop continuously  
<br>
desirable?
<br>
What for becoming a god ,but preserving an imperitive too... recreate and  
<br>
simulate all it's ancestor selves? Hence survival, and more.

<p><em>&gt; The thread view (identity is a verb, a continuing thread of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the pattern view (identity is an adjective; as John Clark put it, &quot;I  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way matter behaves when it is organized in a Johnclarkian way&quot;) give  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same results most of the time; the one scenario that always gets  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adherents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the two arguing with each other is destructive scan uploading (fine by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pattern view, semelparous suicide by the identity view). (Happily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradual uploading is a potential way around this problem for the thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another scenario in which the two views might give different results is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wish expressed by some transhumanists that can be summarized as &quot;when I  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up I want to be a Great Old One&quot;; that is, over the next while - say, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million subjective years - they want to continually modify and augment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves such that the result will be, as they see it, as far beyond  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original as the original was beyond an amoeba. (I don't personally accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the analogy even given the premises, but it gets the point across nicely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough that I did happily make use of it for science fiction purposes.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To me, as a subscriber to the pattern view, this doesn't make sense  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said entity wouldn't be me anymore, so it would be a form of suicide; one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could still regard the future existence of such an entity as a cool  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but why would one have a desire to use oneself in particular as a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seed/raw
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it occurs to me that it makes perfect sense from the thread  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with appropriate care (don't discard so much that the result, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly intelligent, no longer has any feeling or awareness so that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't anyone, etc) a huge change could be done as a series of incremental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steps, each small enough that the thread of consciousness was unbroken;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subscriber to this view could reasonably believe a Great Old One _would_  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, if it came into existence by the right path.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One should then desire to follow this path if and only if one believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradual uploading is better than destructive scan uploading. I'm curious  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to how many positive and negative examples of this theory there are?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Meta: This is an SL3-4 topic, which people on the SL4 list have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhappy about the shortage of lately; it's also I believe on-topic for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropy-chat, and is something of a followup to a previous (lower SL)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message I posted there, so it seems appropriate for both lists; if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderators of one or both lists disagree, or if crossposting like this  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right way to go about it, please let me know.)
