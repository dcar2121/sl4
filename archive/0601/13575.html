</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are seriously claiming that these three groups (one of them your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group) have built three &quot;real&quot; conscious machines, and are going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publicly demonstrate them during 2006, then I challenge you (and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other two) to say EXACTLY what level of &quot;consciousness&quot; you mean.
</em><br>
<p>This is how it appears, but I am only certain about my own invention.  We
<br>
all claim an invention that is a humanlike, intelligent, self-aware
<br>
machine, or conscious machine, functioning like a brain in the human body
<br>
does. So by definition it should not be a thermostat consciousness or a
<br>
parakeet consciousness, but a humanlike consciousness. So I am just as
<br>
picky, and in total agreement, and will gladly answer your Loosemore MC
<br>
Challenge. I also do not want to see thermostat or parakeet &quot;consciousness&quot;
<br>
passing itself off as human level consciousness, which is implied in the
<br>
term &quot;machine consciousness.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I don't really have a problem, in principle, with such a broad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of consciousness (as a continuum of types of behavior that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range all the way from thermostat to superintelligence), but what I do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object to is people making grand announcements and then turning up to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the press conference holding a bimetal strip connected to a relay 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switch, and asking me to applaud.
</em><br>
<p><p>Precisely. And that is why I have proposed the Searle Chinese Room Test for
<br>
machine consciousness. The CPU must &quot;understand&quot; the incoming Chinese talk
<br>
it is translating into English, and the resulting English, in the same way
<br>
humans do, where this is taken to mean &quot;as it is received by human level
<br>
consciousness.&quot;  Then (and only then) it can be called for all intents and
<br>
purposes a conscious machine. This cannot be accomplished by a thermostat
<br>
consciousness, or primitive feedback loop, or by a Parakeet consciousness,
<br>
which can memorize and parrot responses to incoming words, but has no
<br>
actual understanding of their meaning. Only a luman level machine
<br>
consciousness can actually understand the meaning like human level
<br>
consciousness can, and so, we have an authentic conscious machine. So this
<br>
is the level of consciousness I am talking about, and is true human level
<br>
consciousness, called machine consciousness (MC).  So my first response to
<br>
you: Do you accept this general formulation and test for machine
<br>
consciousness? If so you will conclude that my droids are in fact conscious
<br>
machines, also called &quot;Real AI,&quot; strong AI, and AGI.
<br>
Machine consciousness must mimic human consciousness, so that they are
<br>
human level intelligent and self-aware upon birth, and can grow via enough
<br>
specialized self-modification and training into the super human intelligent
<br>
technological singularity. And this is what I claim for my droids - they
<br>
are truly conscious machines as defined.
<br>
<p>This is all a part of my Company Manifesto entitled, **The Next Computer
<br>
Age Will Be The Age of the Droids**
