</em><br>
<p>It's worth noting that in general, Gold Medal Performance is not
<br>
actually much higher than 'bad day' performance, in the olympics. It
<br>
depends on how high a competition you're in, and other things, aside
<br>
from the occasional world performance(which sometimes doesn't mean
<br>
you'll get a gold, if the man in the lane next to you also has such a
<br>
day)
<br>
<p>But that is somewhat something of a side-issue. We don't need the
<br>
remote-viewers to be the best in the world, just above random.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this is exactly the practical consideration to which I drew attention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Millions or hundred of millions of bits, all generated (ideally) in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last couple of days before the draw. Pity we need humans in the loop. A psi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine would be handy. Maybe an AI will do it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, let's see what we need. If we divide the lotto into single digit
<br>
guesses, then for the Mega Millions we have 12 digits to get. each
<br>
digit can be 0-9. If you really can get 1 extra correct guess out of a
<br>
hundred, and the guesses are otherwise randomly distributed, then
<br>
after ten thousand guesses, the correct digit will have an extra 100
<br>
points on an average of 1000, which should put it above the noise
<br>
floor of perfectly random guesses. Given human inability to actually
<br>
output good random noise, we might need much more than that, another
<br>
order of magnitude, perhaps. So if we assume 100000 guesses for each
<br>
digit, then we need 1.2 million guesses to win the mega millions
<br>
lotto. Now there are other considerations, of course, depending on the
<br>
output data, you may be able to hedge your bets by buying the tickets
<br>
that correspond to the top few candidate digits, lowering the accuracy
<br>
requirements.
<br>
<p>I participated in a psychic experiment, and managed 1000 guesses in
<br>
two hours before getting too bored to continue. I would assume
<br>
sustained speed would be somewhat below that, so a good day's work
<br>
might be... 5000 guesses? that means that winning the lotto is 240
<br>
person-days of work. Assuming self-scoring psychics, that works out to
<br>
$216,666 per person-day for the current top US Jackpot of 52 million.
<br>
It would take five psychics under two months to do it, 20, twelve
<br>
days. A single psychic would be working full days for months and
<br>
months.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Largely, yes. That, and the appalling cultural pollution by crackpots and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; halfwits and scoundrels.
</em><br>
<p>If it's &quot;largely&quot; aversive reflex, why is it that attempted
<br>
replications by other parapsychologists even, like of Schmidt's random
<br>
number experiments, tend to fail?
<br>
<p>&quot;The main fact that emerges from this data is that 71 experiments gave
<br>
a result supporting Schmidt's findings and 261 experiments failed to
<br>
do so&quot; (Hansel 1989: 185).
<br>
<p>These are the kinds of results that I tend to be thinking of when
<br>
people mention psi, not my normal skeptical &quot;this is a new and creepy
<br>
effect&quot;.
