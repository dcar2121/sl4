Note:
<br>
<p>People may wonder why I'm talking about what seems
<br>
like metaphysics again.  But I'm discussing the nature
<br>
of mathematics here and since AI work is basically
<br>
pure mathematics, I'd say understanding the nature of
<br>
mathematics could be critical to AGI.
<br>
<p>From: Marc, who is aiming to quickly 'close out' the
<br>
Singularity game in a spectacular blaze of glory.    
<br>
<p>O.K, let me now start to bring this game to a swift
<br>
and shocking end...
<br>
<p><p>Ben Heaton said &gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just to check: is this related to the idea that, for
</em><br>
example, Fermat's Last Theorem was not true until a
<br>
proof for it was discovered?
<br>
<p>No 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If your idea is something more meaningful than that,
</em><br>
then can you give an example of a mathematical claim
<br>
that you think has even a slight metaphysical
<br>
possibility of being time-dependent? I'm not asking
<br>
for an example of one that definitely is, just one
<br>
where it wouldn't be obviously ridiculous to believe
<br>
that it might be. All the examples of mathematical
<br>
theorems I can think of lack any indexical references
<br>
to times, but if you know of something I'm
<br>
overlooking, I'd like to learn about it. 
<br>
<p><p>Deductive mathematical proofs cannot by definition be
<br>
time dependent.  So if there are any time indexed
<br>
mathematical properties they must be inductive (in the
<br>
sense of probability theory).  
<br>
<p>If one subscribes to mathematical Platonism (the idea
<br>
that mathematical entities have objective existence)
<br>
then there may be a way to define the 'changes in
<br>
state' of these mathematical entities.
<br>
<p>If you imagine a Platonically existing proof that no
<br>
mathematician has yet discovered, then imagine a proof
<br>
which every one knows about, one could say that the
<br>
mathematical entities which are the 'theorems'
<br>
(proofs) under go 'changes of state' when they change
<br>
from existing only in Platonic reality, to existing as
<br>
representations in the physical world.  The
<br>
mathematical entity is not the same thing as a
<br>
particular instantiation of that entity in the
<br>
physical world.  The mathematical entity can exist
<br>
purely Platonically, or it can 'project down' into the
<br>
physical world and be instantiated in physical matter.
<br>
&nbsp;When the entity 'projects into' the physical world,
<br>
it can be defined as having 'changed its state'.  For
<br>
instance, a mathematical theorem which is not known by
<br>
any one is in a 'different state' to a mathematical
<br>
theorem which also exists in the minds of
<br>
mathematicians.
<br>
<p>The time indexed mathematical theorems then, are
<br>
likely the one's expressing the relationship between
<br>
platonic properties, physical properties and mental
<br>
(volitional) properties (see the example I gave above
<br>
- a mathematical entity can be said to have 'changed
<br>
state' when it goes from existing only in the Platonic
<br>
realm , to becoming manifest in the physical and
<br>
mental realms).
<br>
<p>Now these ideas may not help much in identifying
<br>
exactly what the time indexed mathematical properties
<br>
are, but they do, I hope, show you that platonic
<br>
mathematical entities are not necessarily the static,
<br>
timeless things many philosophers think they are.
<br>
<p><p>Again, you may all ask, how is all this metaphysics
<br>
relevant to AGI work?  Well, consciousness appears to
<br>
be intimately connected to the integration of
<br>
information.  See:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sci-con.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=188">http://www.sci-con.org/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=188</a>
<br>
<p>The integration of information is in turn intimately
<br>
connected to the discovery of mathematical truth.  As
<br>
I suggested above, if platonic mathematical entities
<br>
can undergo 'changes of state' when they go from
<br>
existing only platonically to existing in someone's
<br>
mind and if the mathematical truths representing this
<br>
process are time indexed (or time dependent) then
<br>
consciousness itself (and information integration)
<br>
would be precisely equivalent to the 'movements' of
<br>
platonic mathematical entities or the sub-set of
<br>
mathematical truths that were time dependent...
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>&quot;Till shade is gone, till water is gone, into the shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder’s eye on the last day”
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
