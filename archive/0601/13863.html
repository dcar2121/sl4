<p>
I've been thinking about self-improvement methods available to humans
<br>
right now, and particularly for Seed AI Wannabes. What are people's
<br>
thoughts on the value of time spent improving &quot;general&quot; intelligence and
<br>
rationality versus time spent on the specific fields relevant to Seed
<br>
AI? (Of course, you can often do both at once)
<br>
<p>In particular, I think we can use LOGI to classify different methods of
<br>
self-improvement. Here's a look at some stuff that's cheaply available
<br>
now:
<br>
<p><p><p>Code level: nothing.
<br>
<p><p><p>Modality level: reading, speed reading (how effective is this,
<br>
anybody?), foreign languages, and also various sports, martial arts, and
<br>
&quot;twitch&quot; video games.
<br>
<p><p><p>Concept level: I think that most people do not often generate new
<br>
concepts except as children. Concepts can be serialized into text or
<br>
speech, and then re-encoded by another human, but the transfer is lossy.
<br>
Because of this, it is usually not possible to teach someone a complex
<br>
concept unless you can express it concisely in terms of simpler concepts
<br>
that they already know. 
<br>
<p>A person who is experienced at generating new concepts should be able to
<br>
&quot;repair&quot; concepts that have been mangled by the process of serialization
<br>
and re-encoding, and so should be able to learn concepts faster with
<br>
fewer supporting concepts. Most training available today (in any
<br>
specialized subject) seems to focus on conveying a large number of
<br>
concepts.
<br>
<p>What is out there that can help you practice generating new concepts?
<br>
Well, there are induction games like Zendo and and Eleusis, which
<br>
(depending on who you are playing with) can lead to many new concepts,
<br>
but these new concepts are usually discarded after the game ends. It has
<br>
been suggested to me that the process of learning games like Go involves
<br>
generating concepts, but this seems very slow to me. Writing science
<br>
fiction seems like it fits here too.
<br>
<p><p><p>Thought and deliberation levels: &quot;Critical thinking,&quot; the scientific
<br>
method, mathematical logic, and probability theory all go here, and so
<br>
do things like meditation. These are different approaches to thought
<br>
that can be learned, but seem to be very sensitive to natural ability.
<br>
High schools and universities attempt (or claim to attempt) to teach
<br>
&quot;critical thinking,&quot; but are they teaching anything, or only weeding out
<br>
those who don't do it already?
<br>
<p>Heuristics and biases belong at the thought level. Learning about
<br>
heuristics and biases can help you spot systematic errors, and
<br>
(hopefully) learn to stop making them.
<br>
<p>Something fun you could try is to sit down with a calculator and Google,
<br>
and optionally a friend, and play Bayescraft: think of a question with N
<br>
possible answers, assign a probability to each, and check the answer.
<br>
Multiply your cumulative score by the probability you assigned to the
<br>
correct answer. Alternatively, one player can write down a sequence in
<br>
binary, and the other players can predict the next value.
