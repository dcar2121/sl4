<p>You did see the phrases &quot;in such experiments&quot; and &quot;long run&quot;? I hope I do 
<br>
not need to emphasise that &quot;long run&quot; does not mean &quot;let's wait for 10 
<br>
years to see if a single prediction is proved to be correct, and if it 
<br>
isn't let's wait for a hundred years.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Let's hear some true believers take the other side
</em><br>
<p>I certainly wouldn't call myself a &quot;true believer&quot; or even, in 
<br>
parapsychological terms, a &quot;sheep&quot;, but I'm sure I am closer to that than 
<br>
John. However, my commonsense, history-based understanding of the journals 
<br>
John quotes assures me that I should vote the same way he does. Hence 
<br>
(according to John's parody of the protocol) my prediction is probably 
<br>
right if psi is real, so we seem to have reached a deadlock.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;what experimental result would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make you conclude that you were wrong and psi research is just a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt;waste of time?
</em><br>
<p>I doubt that any single experiment could do that, but I'm pretty sure that 
<br>
if honest researchers found after several years that all well-conducted 
<br>
experiments had failed to achieve *significant* deviations from mean chance 
<br>
expectation--that is, if the results agree repeatedly with the null 
<br>
hypothesis--I would be inclined to abandon my interest in the field.
<br>
<p>So far, this hasn't happened. On the contrary, as experimental protocols 
<br>
have become stricter, data machine-recorded and readable and hence not prey 
<br>
to unconscious human bias, and methods of analyzing the utterances and 
<br>
drawings of remote viewers into formats susceptible of strict evaluation, 
<br>
significant results (sometimes breathtakingly impressive) continue to be 
<br>
reported. Unsurprisingly, these results hardly ever appear in the pages of 
<br>
physics or chemistry journals, or the academic organs of swine science, 
<br>
architecture, dentistry, the history of Chinese calligraphy, or many other 
<br>
scholarly venues.
