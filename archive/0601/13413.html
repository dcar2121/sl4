Funny as goat-psi-factor investigations might seem, I would think that some 
<br>
investigation into the parapschological capacities of nonhumans would be 
<br>
highly appropriate for a &quot;respectable parapsychologist.&quot;
<br>
<p>_IF_ any parapsychological phenomena were observable in humans, would it not 
<br>
be appropriate to investigate which animals have similar capacities?  It 
<br>
would be an unfounded assumption to believe that such capacities would be 
<br>
limited to humans.
<br>
<p>One can imagine that even minor parapsychological influence would have a 
<br>
distinct evolutionary advantage.  Although parapsychological abilities 
<br>
/could/ be linked to the encephalisation of humans, such abilities could 
<br>
just as easily be linked to other brain parts that are not more developed in 
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>I can think of some experimental setups that might detect parapsychological 
<br>
influence arising from goats, dogs, rats... it might be trickier with 
<br>
non-domesticated animals.  Could domestication have influence?
<br>
<p>Now, as soon as I can raise funding for respectable scientific research into 
<br>
performing investigations to test the veracity of claims of the effects of 
<br>
homeopathy, bio-dynamism, astrology, and various pure-energy sources*, I'll 
<br>
see what I can do to start performing some parapsych research on Goats
<br>
<p>* If you don't believe that respectable science can be done in these fields, 
<br>
you don't understand science, you &quot;Believe in Science!&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p><p>(Oh, another thing on psych and gambling - surely if ever there was an 
<br>
environment capable of interfering with positive parapsycological influence, 
<br>
it would be gambling dens and casinos.  Such emptiness and mis-strewn hope 
<br>
have I never seen elsewhere.)

<em>&gt;I know you explained the sheep-goats phenomenon in an earlier email, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had to laugh when I pictured researchers trying to examine the psi factor

<em>&gt; &gt; If someone is able to influence an experiment in such a way was to make
