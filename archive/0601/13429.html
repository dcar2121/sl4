Thank you.  This was all I was asking for.  Someone to post about a psi-mechanism so we could kill psi forever or embrace whatever is actually causing it.  I'm psi-qued out at the moment.  Will post back next week regarding what I think are the specific brain faculties and EM frequencies responsible for affecting (un)conscious decisions and the RNG used.  The reason I choose not to ignore this thread is because there is so much more than psi at stake here.  The Psi effect might actually be evidence of the brain faculty responsible for consciousness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;That said (if you're still reading) I don't see how you can seriously
<br>
postulate that we can have a modality for some EM anomaly that causes
<br>
randomness on RNGs, and I'll give you a few reasons for this.
<br>
1. Psychological theory on absolute judgement. It is pretty much
<br>
demonstrated by several experiments in psychology in different modalities
<br>
that the human mind is very limited in its capability to make absolute
<br>
judgements of things it perceives, such as distance, colour, tone, loudness,
<br>
etc, to about 3 or 4 bits of depth (iirc). The exception, perfect pitch,
<br>
might be attributed (or not, not conclusive stuff about this, iirc) to
<br>
overlearning. In sum, the input channels of the brain aren't good enough to
<br>
sample stuff at big depths, which means that the minuscule perturbations
<br>
that might affect an RNG are extremely unlikely to be perceivable by
<br>
absolute judgement faculties.
<br>
2. Have you ever played with a magnet around your head? Has it made
<br>
appreciable differences in your thinking? thought not.
<br>
<p>Let's postulate we have a modality somehow though, and the same influences
<br>
that create perturbations on an RNG give rise to perturbations we can
<br>
perceive at some subconscious level. Fine. We have a modality for sight, can
<br>
we determine the luminescence, frequency, etc, of an image? No. Could we
<br>
train to get close to the frequency? Possibly, depending on the value of
<br>
close. The point is though, that frequency is arbitrary, in the sense that a
<br>
second is arbitrary. We couldn't be in agreement with a frequency metre
<br>
produced by a culture with a different value for the second. The way an RNG
<br>
produces numbers is influenced, among other things, by very specifica and
<br>
arbitrary things, such as the units of physics of its builder, the way it
<br>
samples whatever source of randomness, etc. To postulate a coincidence in
<br>
the design of the RNG that somehow gives similar data to that of a brain
<br>
modality would be like finding we can hear a sound and call its frequency in
<br>
hertz, innately, not even knowing what a hertz is, not knowing how long a
<br>
second is, etc. Needless to say, I find this hypothesis completely
<br>
implausible.
<br>
<p>Feel free to go back to another area in which you are hopefully more
<br>
qualified to make judgements, or try to understand why your hypothesis
<br>
doesn't make sense, I don't care which.
<br>
<p>--David.
