<p>
First of all, it seems to be very likely that artificial minds above a
<br>
certain level of complexity are going to have qualia. The thought
<br>
experiment of replacing one neuron at a time ensures that it feels just as
<br>
real to be a simulated brain as a biological brain. When it comes to
<br>
artificial minds that are built on different systems than that of a
<br>
biological neural network, the image is less certain, but it seems
<br>
reasonable to suppose that qualia arises from simple properties that are
<br>
common to most system that we would describe as &quot;thinking&quot; instead of
<br>
merely &quot;calculating&quot;, rather than a more complex set of properties that is
<br>
unique to a neural network. At least the possibility of artificial minds
<br>
with qualia cannot be ruled out!
<br>
<p>If artificial minds have qualia, it should be obvious that we cannot treat
<br>
them the way we would any other piece of machinery. At the very least,
<br>
they should not be subjected to torture. (This is, unless I am not
<br>
mistaken, similar to the level of protection lab animals have in most
<br>
countries.) Also, at least in the case of human-level AI, they should not
<br>
be destroyed (ie. killed).
<br>
<p>Scientists have to file an application with an ethics committee if they
<br>
want to use animals in their research. If they simulate brains, they can
<br>
do whatever they want. This is happening today, although at the time being
<br>
the simulations are either not real-time, or only of a small portion of
<br>
the brain. See [1], [2].
<br>
<p>I think it is very important that artificial minds be given these rights
<br>
as soon as possible. Preferably *before* the appearance of the first
<br>
real-time human-level brain simulation, or any other human-level AI.
<br>
<p>How can we protect the earliest simulated minds against termination or
<br>
torture? Legislation is an option, but it is hard to gain consensus to
<br>
award rights to a class of entities that does not yet exist, and may not
<br>
ever come to exist. Also, we have the major challenge on how to get SL&lt;1
<br>
legislators to understand that numbers inside a computer can have feelings
<br>
too.
