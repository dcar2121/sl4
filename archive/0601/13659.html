<p>See this paper to read Ray Kurzweil destroy Searle's ridiculous argument. This is my favourite argument from Ray - it should be standard reading for any philosophy of mind or AI class. I recommend reading it as it is quite short.
<br>
-----------------------------------
<br>
<p>As a builder of machine consciousness, I am interested in Turing and Searle solely for test ideas for the soon-coming pack of MC Contenders. From this point of view, the basic Searle argument perfectly describes the classical computer systems of his age - which are not conscious machines- and points the way for TESTING for the next, post-classical computer system's critical features - which are conscious machines.
<br>
<p><p>The argument from Searle himself, as acknowledged in the Kurzweil paper -
<br>
<p>&quot;I believe the best-known argument against strong AI was my Chinese room argument (Searle 1980a) that showed that a system could instantiate a program so as to give a perfect simulation of some human cognitive capacity, such as the capacity to understand Chinese, even though that system had no understanding of Chinese whatever.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>The Searle argument boiled down to a proposition -
<br>
<p>A simulatory, card-shuffling, dumb system with no understanding of the cognitive task it is performing, can never be considered a strong AI conscious machine.
<br>
<p><p>As an MC builder, I absolutely agree with, and support this assertion, and will apply it to all MC Contenders, including myself.
<br>
<p>Can you imagine a dumb, card shuffling classical (1950-2005) computer system - expert system or otherwise - running a program that is a &quot;perfect simulation of some human cognitive capacity&quot; (our debate capacity being textual entailment recognition), even though that system &quot;had no understanding&quot; of this cognitive capability &quot;whatever.&quot;?  Sounds like a perfect description of all the &quot;rule of thumb&quot; driven, dumb card shuffling, **classical computer systems** I have ever seen, including rule based expert systems and robot languages. Such dumb card shuffling, simulatory, classical system can never attain the status of a strong AI conscious machine.
<br>
<p>However, it implies the alternative: if the system DOES have an &quot;understanding of the cognitive capability' so that it does pass the Searle test - i.e., Hey look there - that CHINESE MAN in the Room DOES have an &quot;understanding of the human cognitive capacity&quot;!! The classical dumb, card shuffling NON-CHINESE MAN doing the task NEVER can be said to be a strong AI, conscious machine who &quot;understands the human cognitive capacity&quot; being performed. However, if the post-classical, human level consciousness duplicating &quot;droid&quot; CHINESE MAN is put in the room, who DOES  have an &quot;understanding of the human cognitive capacity&quot; CAN be said to be (or partially be) a strong AI conscious machine.
