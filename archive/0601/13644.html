<em>&gt; Searle has elaborated repeatedly and extensively on the Chinese room
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument in the 25 or so years since he made it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the things he says is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we need &quot;brain stuff&quot; to produce consciousness, and that the lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness in the computer is because it lacks a physical substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with specific, but currently unknown, properties (much like Penrose'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum-mystery-stuff).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, in other words, a soul.
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you saying that the unknown parts (purpose and function) of the human
<br>
brain is what you arbitrarily label the &quot;soul&quot;?  If so, then the part you
<br>
are reserving for humanity is the unknown by also claiming that it is
<br>
inherently unknowable.  (in agreement with Godel's Incompleteness Theorem)
<br>
You object to giving a manufactured 'thinking machine' any membership to
<br>
consciousness because you (we) would have apriori knowledge of every part of
<br>
the manufactured machine.  Maybe that's a bit arrogant to believe in the
<br>
superiority of the group to which you belong solely (soul-ly?) on the basis
<br>
of what potential remains to be discovered about the group.  Perhaps this
<br>
godlike state of omniscience over our creations is justified (OK, let's not
<br>
debate the specific details of god - just go with the overall concept)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the concern of those debating this topic on the pro
<br>
AI-are-people-too side is that the creation has the capacity to outpace its
<br>
creator.  The need to 'enhance' human wetware by integrating with technology
<br>
(or by using better chemistry, or nanochem or whatever) probably comes from
<br>
the intention to maintain the perception of superiority, even at the cost of
<br>
admitting that the technology is even able to provide the enhancement.
<br>
Humans can be very irrational.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Along another line of thinking - If the &quot;Penrose' quantum-mystery-stuff&quot;
<br>
is essentially chaotic, then why can't it be modelled inside the machine?
<br>
If the Mandelbrot fractal can be expressed/encoded in a few dozen bytes, and
<br>
&quot;rendered&quot; within a given region to a specific depth, how long does the
<br>
resultant construct take to &quot;understand&quot; when applied to a universe where
<br>
each  dimensions has meaning?   Supposing a belief in the concept of an &quot;old
<br>
soul,&quot; I suggest that the meaning of a life is to gain an understanding of a
<br>
more subtle nuance than the life experienced by a &quot;new soul&quot;.   A
<br>
computational equivalent would be for a machine to achieve an 'enlightened'
<br>
understanding of a 3x3 grid - such as the arrangement and number of each
<br>
unit square.  Upon reaching this state of awareness, a new observation is
<br>
made:  each unit square is composed of a 3x3 grid of smaller squares.  If
<br>
our thinking machine uses recursion to examine each fractal square, will it
<br>
pop from a stack overflow - or will it somehow break the recursion by coming
<br>
to understand the nature of recursion itself?  I would be interested/happy
<br>
to see a thinking machine discover recursion without having apriori
<br>
programming to defend against it.
<br>
<p><p>My more important point is that Woody's test is untestable.  We have no
<br>
<em>&gt; way to evaluate whether a machine is conscious of the meaning of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inputs in the same way that a human is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Honestly, we have no way to evaluate that humans have the same way of
<br>
consciously evaluating inputs.  We tend to naturally aggregate ourselves
<br>
among groups of &quot;like minded&quot; behavioral outcome expectation, but the way in
<br>
which each of us arrive at that outcome is subjective.  I have no proof that
<br>
any idea posted to this list is any more &quot;human&quot; than a sufficiently
<br>
advanced AI would have be believe it to be.  My point is that it doesn't
<br>
really matter - I interact with you (collectively) because I enjoy the
<br>
subjective experience of thinking about the ideas presented.  (well, most of
<br>
them  :)
