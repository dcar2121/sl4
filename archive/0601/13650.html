{The important bit of this post is nearer the end.  The first half is just 
<br>
bickering/ lame, but it makes a nice lead-up}
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: Phillip Huggan &lt;<a href="mailto:cdnprodigy@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Resistance%20to%20uploading">cdnprodigy@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   The problem is that the consciousness in our brains is material.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical books you destroyed are gone.  Even if you have the information 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contained in them, the cellulose fibers are incinerated.
</em><br>
<p>Then the “damage done” in destroying those books would depend on whether 
<br>
their value was in their information content, or their physical 
<br>
manifestation.
<br>
<p>Sometimes, the physical manifestation is important.
<br>
<p>Example: Great works of art have value that extend beyond representations of 
<br>
the images.  An original Van Gogh painting is more valuable than a print.  
<br>
Admittedly, the bulk of the value is in the image, and prints of Van Gogh 
<br>
paintings are still great to hang on your wall, but can you imagine 
<br>
explaining to the National Gallery of Art that you want to destroy a Van 
<br>
Gogh in order to convert it to digital?
<br>
<p>(That points to a matter not relevant to “effective” uploading.  Flatbed 
<br>
scans of books won’t provide as clear a resolution as the original.  There 
<br>
will be a loss of visual quality, which will possibly make reading less 
<br>
effective, less pleasant or more tiring.)
<br>
<p>That aside, there are other things that make physical instantiations 
<br>
important.  It’s not always obvious what these are, which is why a touch of 
<br>
precautionary prudence is a good thing…
<br>
<p>Ms Calendar: Honestly, what is it about them that bothers you so much?
<br>
Giles: The smell.
<br>
Ms Calendar: Computers don't smell, Rupert.
<br>
Giles: I know. Smell is the most powerful trigger to the memory there is. A 
<br>
certain flower or a whiff of smoke can bring up experiences long forgotten. 
<br>
Books smell. Musty and, and, and, and rich. The knowledge gained from a 
<br>
computer, is, it ... it has no texture, no context. It's there and then it's 
<br>
gone. If it's to last, then the getting of knowledge should be tangible, it 
<br>
should be, um... smelly
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Really people, this idea of uploading has got to stop.  The &quot;dumb&quot; IQ 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;100 masses are right on this one, to be averse to suicide.
</em><br>
<p>I don’t think that you can confidently say that uploading=suicide.  It 
<br>
/might/ be possible to be uploaded, while maintaining a “continuity of 
<br>
consciousness” or some such thing.  I doubt that you could prove it to not 
<br>
be possible.
<br>
<p>But,
<br>
<p>== RELEVANT BIT ==
<br>
<p>Even if it is possible to seamlessly upload a person, maintaining continuity 
<br>
of consciousness, and the uploaded experience doesn’t result in a loss of 
<br>
subtleties, nonetheless, it is _not_ a good way to go about promoting the 
<br>
Singularity by promoting Uploading.
<br>
<p>Most people find uploading initially repulsive.  I don’t care whether this 
<br>
is justified or not.  It’s how people think.
<br>
<p>Despite this, Uploading is promoted as one of the Good Things about the 
<br>
singularity.  There’s an intro on the SIAI site with the subtitle “how we 
<br>
can participate in the Singularity”.
<br>
<p>But in order to promote the Singularity as a means to achieve uploading, you 
<br>
have to convince most people of a lot of things:
<br>
<p>(1) Uploading is possible (2) There is a “continuity of consciousness” so 
<br>
that /You/ get to experience life as an upload. (3) It’s actually more 
<br>
enjoyable being an uploaded entity than a biological entity (4) A 
<br>
technological singularity is likely to occur (5) The technological 
<br>
singularity will assist you to be uploaded.
<br>
<p>That’s a lot of things you’d need to convince the average person to support 
<br>
the singularity.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, since most people think that uploading is a bad idea for the 
<br>
uploadee (and it’s hard to convince them otherwise), any statements to the 
<br>
effect of (1) “most people will be uploaded” or (2) “everyone will want to 
<br>
be uploaded” or (3) “un-uploaded people will have difficulty keeping up with 
<br>
uploaded people” is going to turn them off.
<br>
<p>Telling them (1) will make them think that the Singularity is a bad idea, 
<br>
and/or that you’re a kook.  Telling them (2) will make them think that you 
<br>
don’t understand what they want, so this Singularity thing won’t be what 
<br>
they want, either.  Statement (3) sounds like a Dystopia, and they’ll think 
<br>
“we should shut these people down immediately.”
<br>
<p>By contrast, if you promoting the singularity as a means for the person to 
<br>
get what they want, by having effectively unlimited, creative computing 
<br>
power at their disposal, leading to cures for diseases, solutions to 
<br>
problems… they can dig that.
<br>
<p>There is a value in talking about Uploading and brain scanning as a means to 
<br>
create a human-equivalent intelligence.  People easily understand that an 
<br>
uploaded human will be as smart as a biological human.  They also get that 
<br>
you can just speed up the simulation to make it work faster à creating a 
<br>
singularity.  They might doubt that it is possible, but as long as you’re 
<br>
not talking about uploading /them/, there’s no reason to get turned off.
<br>
<p>One doesn’t need to exist as the uploaded entity to enjoy the benefits of 
<br>
uploading.  A clone of me is useful to me.
<br>
<p>Talk about uploading, or even just brain scanning, in /this/ context is 
<br>
relevant and useful.
<br>
<p>Talking about uploading for personal advantage has about as much value as 
<br>
talking about the fact that post-singularity, you want to have all your 
<br>
genetic material stored on a single chromosome made from platinum compounds. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There might be some advantage to this – I don’t know – but it does seem 
<br>
rather odd and impractical.
<br>
<p>I mean, I’d like to have four arms and see infrared.  Whoopty doo.  I’m not 
<br>
going to discuss engineering it here.
