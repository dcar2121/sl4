<p>You're conflating empirical propositions with moral choices, mixing up 
<br>
probability theory and decision theory.  Perhaps you are confused 
<br>
because English uses the same word &quot;believe in&quot; to indicate both your 
<br>
hypotheses and your ethics.
<br>
<p>I *choose* love and life and laughter, beauty and goodness.  I also 
<br>
choose truth.  I strive to attain the map that reflects the territory; 
<br>
to believe based solely on evidence, and to abjure any shift of credence 
<br>
whatsoever which is not based on evidence.  For you cannot draw an 
<br>
accurate map of a city by sitting in your living room and having great 
<br>
faith in your doodles.  You must go outside and walk down streets, and 
<br>
keep your eyes open, and look around, and make lines on paper that 
<br>
correspond to what you see, and resist the temptation to draw in a few 
<br>
extra lines just for fun.
<br>
<p>P.C. Hodgell said:  &quot;That which can be destroyed by the truth should 
<br>
be.&quot;  I have never heard a declaration of rationality which is both 
<br>
simpler and better than this.  If a wire approaches, and I believe it to 
<br>
be electrified, and it is *not* electrified, then the truth opposes my 
<br>
fear.  If a wire approaches, and I believe it is not electrified, and it 
<br>
*is* electrified, then the Way opposes my calm.  I wish to attain those 
<br>
feelings and ethics and emotions and principles which I would aver if I 
<br>
saw truly, being the person that I am.  Where is the false statement I 
<br>
must believe, to choose love and life and laughter?
