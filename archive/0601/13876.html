I question wether significant personal survival is possible (to the  
<br>
present us), the thread view has the problem of sleep, and the pattern  
<br>
view has the problem of change. Self awareness may just be an illusion, an  
<br>
evolved mechanism for conventional situations. I wonder how our sense of  
<br>
self awareness would have evolved if duplication, merging, transfer etc  
<br>
were in our environment.
<br>
<p>Yes a loop where you change is what I meant, since we're vectors, not  
<br>
points. If change is bad, I would think we should take it to it's logical  
<br>
extreme (perhaps from birth to now looped, or a day).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;Perfect&quot; and &quot;utopia&quot; are rather vague concepts, I think I'd need to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more detailed proposal for one before I could really comment on it.
</em><br>
A niven scenario, that would be fun! That is a fairly static society.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, &quot;since you determined how it would be, you had power over it, and  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you&quot; would seem to imply that if you write a book for example, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survives indefinitely, this is a form of immortality? (I'm not saying  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view is right or wrong, just checking whether it is your view.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A better way of explaing it is; suppose we discard the idea of a broad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; self. Then we have a phase-space of entitys lasting for mere instants
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (possibly longer if it is static).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Then the real question becomes; why should one entity be loyal towards  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; particular future entity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some people want personal survival for its own sake (myself included,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it isn't my highest value).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A more general idea would be that you should be loyal to those future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities which share or contribute to your values; that would seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent with your thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pragmaticism, the entitys which it has power over, are those through  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it can acheive it's goals(this is where I stretch it a bit).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would seem consistent with the &quot;entities which share or contribute  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your values&quot; idea above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I wouldn't view a static utopia as desirable. Whether a continuous loop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Well I could use the word perfect or eternal utopia instead, if a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is you, and surviving is good, then it follows that preserving the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is desirable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Perfect&quot; and &quot;utopia&quot; are rather vague concepts, I think I'd need to  
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; more detailed proposal for one before I could really comment on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could reasonably be called &quot;static&quot; depends on the length of the loop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; (consider for example a loop of length 2^N where N is the number of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; describing a particular mind state within some broad category).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; - Russell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't understand the maths, do you mean; the loop is larger than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the mind, or that it grows as the mind grows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, let's suppose you go into a loop, but the loop is, say, 10^30
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective years long before you start repeating yourself, and the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of thoughts and experiences you have during those 10^30 years are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much larger than could fit into your mind at any one time; I suppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would count as &quot;the loop is larger than just the mind&quot;.
</em><br>
