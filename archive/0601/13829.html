<p>Okay, that's a third view, distinct from both the pattern and thread views;
<br>
let's call it the substrate view.
<br>
<p>I'm curious: is the substrate view falsifiable?
<br>
<p>To take a specific example: Suppose destructive scan uploading becomes
<br>
available in our lifetimes and I go ahead and take the option and then come
<br>
along and say &quot;hey, the pattern view was right, I'm uploaded and still me&quot;.
<br>
<p>The threadites would say (if I understand them correctly), &quot;Sure, we agree
<br>
you are you, you're just not the _same_ you as the pre-upload person.&quot;
<br>
<p>Would you agree the substrate view had been falsified? Or would you say
<br>
&quot;Your claim to be conscious is just Eliza-style parroting, you're really
<br>
just a zombie?&quot; Or do you think the scenario is impossible to begin with
<br>
because nothing running on nonbiological substrate could pass the Turing
<br>
test? Or some fourth option?
