<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If (as I do) one adopts some form of Platonism, then
<br>
mathematical entities are not just social creations
<br>
but exist 'out there' in reality.  One could go
<br>
further aka Tegmark and equate mathematics (Platonia)
<br>
with the underlying fabric of reality itself from
<br>
which all other properties somehow emerge.  Since
<br>
ideally we'd like an AGI to over time approach the
<br>
status of a 'Universal reasoner' (in the sense of
<br>
being able to reason under any many domains in reality
<br>
as pragmatically possible), and if mathematics is the
<br>
fabric of reality itself, then it's not implausible
<br>
that understanding the nature of mathematical
<br>
reasoning could be the key to AGI.
<br>
<p>My final wacky theory of consciousness (which I
<br>
suggested in my earlier threads) is that consciousness
<br>
(or 'Qualia') is ultimately a particular mathematical
<br>
property - the property underpinning all reality.  I
<br>
also made the radical suggestion that mathematical
<br>
truth may not be fixed - that some truths are time
<br>
dependent.  And I equate the particular mathematical
<br>
property that is consciousness precisely with this
<br>
'shifting' of math truths.  In other words, my idea is
<br>
that Qualia *are* simply math truths shifting (see my
<br>
earlier threads on 'mathematical causality').
<br>
<p>I set out to discover the *general* conceptual
<br>
philosophical principles underpinning reality.  My
<br>
theory is basically now completed.  I did it to the
<br>
very best of my ability.  So my mission is basically
<br>
over.  Essentially my philosophical odyssey is at an
<br>
end.  Either I got it exactly right or it's all shit
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>And of course, needless to say I've long long since
<br>
out-stayed my welcome on this mailing list ;)  So this
<br>
really will be my post here (seriously).  Also, as
<br>
I've long promised, I am also *publicly* retiring from
<br>
anything related to AGI/Singularitary.  (Though you
<br>
should note that word *publicly*)  The 'players' are
<br>
mean, nasty and way too clever for me ;)  It really is
<br>
time for me to bow out.
<br>
<p>However, the rhyme below sums up my final position on
<br>
the consciousness puzzle in a fun way.  I contrast my
<br>
position with that of other famous philosophers.  One
<br>
last attempt from me at SL4 infamy.  Farewell and good
<br>
luck!
<br>
<p><p>'The Mathematico-Cognition Rhyme'
<br>
by Marc Geddes
<br>
<p>'Consciousness had all philosopher's perplexed
<br>
In disagreement all were hexed
<br>
Except that from supernatural explanations
<br>
none any longer took heart
<br>
Given that Ryle had exorcised the ghost of Descartes'
<br>
<p>'Eliminate this talk of Qualia! called Dennett and
<br>
Churchland
<br>
Minds made of meat! chimed in Minsky
<br>
Material processes are all that's there
<br>
and in objective science only should we care
<br>
This consciousness contortion is just folk-lore
<br>
illusion'
<br>
<p>No!  It's Mathematico-Cognition don't you know, cried
<br>
Geddes
<br>
<p>'Patterns alone are not sufficient, called Searle
<br>
A Chinese room is mere syntax so seeming
<br>
Mere shuffling of symbols cannot produce meaning
<br>
Consciousness must ooze, he said, 
<br>
from specific material in the head'
<br>
<p>No!  It's Mathematico-Cognition don't you know, cried
<br>
Geddes
<br>
<p>'Awareness, said Chalmers, is not material
<br>
Upon the physical the phenomenal does supervene
<br>
but within mere matter consciousness cannot convene
<br>
Physics is Extrinsic, but the minds within,
<br>
I say that all concrete things have hidden mental
<br>
twins'
<br>
<p>No!  It's Mathematico-Cognition don't you know, cried
<br>
Geddes
<br>
<p>'The mind cannot be computational, called Penrose
<br>
Godel's theorem bars mere algorithms 
<br>
from the mathematicians heaven
<br>
The mind is free to see truth,
<br>
and not bound by logical fallacy
<br>
Consciousness I tell you, calls for quantum gravity'
<br>
<p>No!  It's Mathematico-Cognition don't you know, cried
<br>
Geddes
<br>
<p>'In Plato's world,
<br>
The Mathematical forms did exist
<br>
The root source of everything they did consist
<br>
But unsuspected was the fact
<br>
that change and flux adhere even in abstract'
<br>
<p>'Where truth has congealed there is comprehensibility
<br>
But some of the landscape defies sensibility
<br>
The great book of proofs is still being written
<br>
In the Platonic realms there is a rift
<br>
For in multi-dimensional time even mathematical truth
<br>
can shift'
<br>
<p>'The mathematical motion does create
<br>
The physical, volitional and abstract substrate
<br>
This mathematical causality is consciousness in fact
<br>
The solution to the philosopher's consternation
<br>
The Holy grail, all are destined to hail'
<br>
<p>It's Mathematico-Cognition don't you know cried Geddes
<br>
It's Mathematico-Cognition!
<br>
