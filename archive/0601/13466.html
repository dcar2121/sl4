<p><em>&gt; Maybe a trivial detail, but &quot;all possible

<p>And so what if it did? I read a book once on
<br>
existentialist ethics (a far better and less
<br>
pretentious tome than it may sound, and I'm sorry
<br>
I can't recall title/author after so many years)
<br>
which contained the following statement (as near
<br>
as I can recall it):
<br>
<p>&quot;Even if we could read each other's minds, our
<br>
existential situation toward one another wouldn't
<br>
change one whit; it would in effect merely be one
<br>
more sense, which might or might not reflect
<br>
reality.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's a good encapsulation of why most 'fringe
<br>
science' is deeply uninteresting; as for why even
<br>
some intelligent people can't quite let go,
<br>
consider that pigeon homing is still unexplained,
<br>
but they can definitely do it. Another more or
<br>
less well-attested 'weird ability' was Nauscopie:

<br>
<p>Nobody knows how it worked, but if we trust the
<br>
historical record, it did. But so what? Getting
<br>
enhanced to have wide-spectrum vision like a
<br>
honeybee (ultraviolet) and a rattlesnake
<br>
(infrared) would be just as impressive, and that
<br>
seems doable.
