&quot;You may not be able to become a seed AI programmer. In fact, it is 
<br>
extremely likely that you can't. This should not break your heart.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile, before the Singularity, consider becoming a regular donor 
<br>
instead. It will be a lot less stressful, and right now we have many fewer 
<br>
regular donors than people who have wandered up and expressed an interest in 
<br>
being seed AI programmers. &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;No one who might actually be hired will be scared off by the thought of an 
<br>
extremely difficult job or harsh competition. If someone is brilliant enough 
<br>
to have any realistic chance of becoming an AI programmer, and ethical 
<br>
enough to be accepted, nothing we could possibly say would scare them away 
<br>
from applying&quot;
