It could also be argued that the mass(es) on which we live are the spent
<br>
fuel of some other race, and that they have no more interest in using our
<br>
planet (or contacting us at all) than we would have if we noticed that some
<br>
germs were multiplying in the ashes after our campfire burned out.
<br>
<p>So we're a bunch of noisily flapping meatbots..  Does it matter if there is
<br>
no one out there to talk to us or if there is but they don't want to?  As
<br>
long as we continue working to improve our situation by our own
<br>
measurements, then it doesn't matter if anyone else notices or cares.

<em>&gt; Just a wee bit of wild speculation I had:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's consider universes in which some other intelligent species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed slightly before us, sent out Non Newman replicators or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somesuch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if they had, then we'd expect to see such probes and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them all over... But wait, if they were, especially via the Von Newman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spamming of the galaxy, including our own personal favorite planet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where would we evolve?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ie, I'm going to suggest the possibility that once at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species has spammed the galaxy with replicators or themselves or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something, then it'd be much less likely that human (or human like)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life could then develop, since the resources of the world would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already be in the process of being munched on by the replicators and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the members of the species themselves. Any galaxy already taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over would have less places and/or opportunity for something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;essentially like us&quot; (leave it to you do decide what the proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference class is here) to develop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we may then be able to validly say that we have no right to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supprised at the lack of signs of such, since the lack of such may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a near prequesite for us existing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, we'd also expect as a prior &quot;number of galaxies in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible universes with something showing up sufficiently before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans to 'take over' before we show up&quot; &gt; &quot;number of galaxies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we're among the first, sufficiently early at least that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing's 'taken over' yet.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the exact relation of p(humans developing | someone else took over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first) * p(someone else took first) vs p(humans developing | noone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; took over first) * p(no one took over first) is the question. My claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that the second conditional is significantly larger than the first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and my wild eyed speculation is that the ratio is sufficiently large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to the ratio of the first prior to the second that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't actually be supprised at, well, at the Fermi &quot;paradox&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or is this all just complete nonsense? :)
