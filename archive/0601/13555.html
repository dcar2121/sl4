</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt;Depends on what caused the crash in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If you could freely move in and out, but inside was just a more rewarding

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;What can you offer to keep people carrying on in the real world when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;would be so easy to duck out?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you greatly overestimate the number of people who'd want to upload 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;themselves into a simulated world, or even see it as something other than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suicide. Sure, lots of people would, but there'd also be plenty who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't - try doing an informal poll (among normal people, not us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technogeeks) and see what percentage of yes and no you get.
</em><br>
<p>If you stated it that way, sure.  But this is a hypothetical *medical* 
<br>
gadget, in some places it is the only medicine you can get.  It doesn't 
<br>
disintegrate your body or anything, it just runs a simulation updating your 
<br>
meat memories in real time while your body is being repaired.  I think you 
<br>
would be amazed at how few people would turn down nanotech medicine of this 
<br>
type where the interface was just a door you walked through.
<br>
<p>You could (I suppose) have an option to stay unconscious and out of touch 
<br>
while being repaired or even the option of a rent a body to keep 
<br>
interacting with the real world.  Nanoscale medical repair work takes from 
<br>
weeks to a year to complete from the estimates I have seen on cryonics 
<br>
patients.  (Though really advanced might be able to repair without being 
<br>
plugged in.)
<br>
<p>The point was not the exact technology that will come along, but any of the 
<br>
class that would offer people subjectively improved &quot;living 
<br>
spaces.&quot;  *Really* interactive games where you put your bod in a closet for 
<br>
a week of princess rescues.  If one or more in this class caught on and 
<br>
some significant fraction of the population went that way almost all the 
<br>
rest would have to go as the population in the physical world dropped below 
<br>
some critical feedback level.
<br>
<p>Without *serious* physical support from AIs or similar level automation it 
<br>
would rapidly become very hard to live in the physical world in any 
<br>
comfort.  We have problems with rising population.  There is no reason to 
<br>
expect fewer problems from a falling one.  For social reasons alone the 
<br>
population would have to withdraw to areas where there was enough density 
<br>
to maintain the active infrastructure.
<br>
<p>Japan may actually do this on the birth rate crash alone.
