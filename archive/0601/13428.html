Hi,
<br>
<p>First, I haven't, that I remember, participated in this psi thread until
<br>
now, so if you've been up reading don't blame it on me.
<br>
<p>I did make a few points about free will, and the consciousness thesis you
<br>
advance, but that's orthogonal here so I won't raise any of that.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Phillip Huggan&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:cdnprodigy@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20testing%20psi">cdnprodigy@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; How is &quot;having a modality at all to make sense of all of this&quot; weird in
</em><br>
any way.  It is the only thing we can be 100% sure of, that our own
<br>
consciousness is real.  The ONLY thing.  The fact that psi cannot be
<br>
reproduced using pseudo-random # generators proves we are not psychic.
<br>
Consciousness is an EM phenomenom.  So is a RNG.  This is more weird than
<br>
believing in ghosts (which I assume is your explanation. If not, what is?)?
<br>
David, I have just told you what psi is.  Why can't this thread die?
<br>
<p>I'm very happy for the thread to die, I don't have much of an interest in
<br>
psi myself. Until now, I thought like most people who are educated (?) that
<br>
psi phenomena could be discounted, but since there seems to be experimental
<br>
evidence to the contrary maybe I was wrong, I don't care much one way or the
<br>
other. The only reason why I intervened in this thread is because your
<br>
mechanism is totally implausible. I don't have a better theory, but no
<br>
theory is better than the wrong theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     I was supposed to be reading about crystal formation patterns and
</em><br>
carbon nanotube defect densities last night.  Instead I spent a few hours
<br>
&quot;researching&quot; psi.  I figure it out and you tell me my explanation is too
<br>
weird?  You know whats really weird?  Cosmology.  Particle streams emitted
<br>
by stellar and other cosmic bodies.  EM brain waves.  Electrical surges.
<br>
Earth's magnetic field.  All too weird to be true I guess.  And
<br>
consciousness?  A figment of our &quot;unconsciousness imaginations&quot; I guess.
<br>
Someone refute my hypothesis plz.  It is the most reasonable explanation of
<br>
psi.
<br>
<p>If you want to read about nanotechnology instead of arguing with me, I won't
<br>
have a problem with that, in fact, very likely it would be a wise choice,
<br>
you know where the delete key lies.
<br>
<p>That said (if you're still reading) I don't see how you can seriously
<br>
postulate that we can have a modality for some EM anomaly that causes
<br>
randomness on RNGs, and I'll give you a few reasons for this.
<br>
1. Psychological theory on absolute judgement. It is pretty much
<br>
demonstrated by several experiments in psychology in different modalities
<br>
that the human mind is very limited in its capability to make absolute
<br>
judgements of things it perceives, such as distance, colour, tone, loudness,
<br>
etc, to about 3 or 4 bits of depth (iirc). The exception, perfect pitch,
<br>
might be attributed (or not, not conclusive stuff about this, iirc) to
<br>
overlearning. In sum, the input channels of the brain aren't good enough to
<br>
sample stuff at big depths, which means that the minuscule perturbations
<br>
that might affect an RNG are extremely unlikely to be perceivable by
<br>
absolute judgement faculties.
<br>
2. Have you ever played with a magnet around your head? Has it made
<br>
appreciable differences in your thinking? thought not.
<br>
<p>Let's postulate we have a modality somehow though, and the same influences
<br>
that create perturbations on an RNG give rise to perturbations we can
<br>
perceive at some subconscious level. Fine. We have a modality for sight, can
<br>
we determine the luminescence, frequency, etc, of an image? No. Could we
<br>
train to get close to the frequency? Possibly, depending on the value of
<br>
close. The point is though, that frequency is arbitrary, in the sense that a
<br>
second is arbitrary. We couldn't be in agreement with a frequency metre
<br>
produced by a culture with a different value for the second. The way an RNG
<br>
produces numbers is influenced, among other things, by very specifica and
<br>
arbitrary things, such as the units of physics of its builder, the way it
<br>
samples whatever source of randomness, etc. To postulate a coincidence in
<br>
the design of the RNG that somehow gives similar data to that of a brain
<br>
modality would be like finding we can hear a sound and call its frequency in
<br>
hertz, innately, not even knowing what a hertz is, not knowing how long a
<br>
second is, etc. Needless to say, I find this hypothesis completely
<br>
implausible.
<br>
<p>Feel free to go back to another area in which you are hopefully more
<br>
qualified to make judgements, or try to understand why your hypothesis
<br>
doesn't make sense, I don't care which.
<br>
<p>--David.
