<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Absolute rubbish.  I programmed C for *years*, and they never

</em><br>
<p><p>It is a good thing that the really important code is written by the  
<br>
other 10% then, isn't it? ;-)
<br>
<p>I never said that programmers do not have problems with pointers  
<br>
(clearly many do), but that there is nothing intrinsic about pointers  
<br>
in C that means they *will* cause trouble.  I programmed C for many  
<br>
years too, and any problems I did have disappeared after a couple  
<br>
years simply by learning proper practice.  The primary problem is not  
<br>
pointers but memory management -- reference counting languages have  
<br>
similar issues in the hands of careless programmers.  I was really  
<br>
reacting to how some people recoil in horror at the thought of  
<br>
programming in C, as though all C code is unavoidably saddled with  
<br>
memory leaks and similar.  It requires a little extra discipline and  
<br>
a clue, which is not an insurmountable sacrifice if you need or want  
<br>
the benefits of C.  Writing bulletproof C *is* painfully verbose.
<br>
<p>There are many reasons to use GC languages or other memory management  
<br>
schemes notably lazy, careless, or bad programmers.  I use languages  
<br>
like Python because I am lazy, not because pointers have ever caused  
<br>
me problems, and much of the C I have written is for server processes  
<br>
that require years of nonstop operation -- if there were problems,  
<br>
they would have become apparent.  Maybe I am special, but I doubt it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2.  Using pointers directly increases code speed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Even more incorrect.
</em><br>
<p><p>You did not comprehend what I was stating.  Direct access to memory  
<br>
management (which pretty much requires pointers) *allows* very  
<br>
significant performance improvements that are not accessible  
<br>
otherwise.  No language is immune to naive code.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     In the long run, performance is a factor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of the big-O of the code, and I am, in general, *guaranteed* to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     come up with a worse (in terms of big-O) piece of code than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     someone who has, say, been studying sorting algorithms for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     entire career.  Thus, if I use a language that has such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     sorting algorithm built into it, I am guaranteed to be better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     off.
</em><br>
<p><p>Not necessarily true; the designer of the generic sorting algorithm  
<br>
has no idea what you are going to do with it.  This issue comes up  
<br>
pretty frequently in the real world when using &quot;highly optimized&quot; but  
<br>
generic libraries for performance sensitive code.  But what do you do  
<br>
after you've squeezed out all the big-O you can?  There is usually  
<br>
integer factors of potential improvement left over in direct memory  
<br>
management and memory layout, even for natively compiled languages.
<br>
<p>In fact, the performance improvement gained by direct memory  
<br>
management is nothing more than optimizing the big-O of memory access/ 
<br>
management algorithms.  Big-O optimization applies as much to what is  
<br>
under the hood as what is on top of it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     This is not to say that all languages without pointers are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     faster than all languages with them, but the idea that having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     direct access to memory pointers in a language *necessarily*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     makes things faster is preposterous.
</em><br>
<p><p>No, it necessarily *allows* a programmer to make things faster, at  
<br>
least with the programming technologies we have today.  Direct memory  
<br>
management in all its guises will buy integer factors performance  
<br>
improvement for many types of codes if you know what you are doing,  
<br>
which is pretty significant.  Compilers and garbage collectors still  
<br>
have pretty crude ideas on how to keep the cache lines full.
<br>
<p>Do what you gotta do.  If speed is important above all else, direct  
<br>
memory management will buy you a hell of a lot of it in many cases,  
<br>
and that requires pointers.  If speed is not so important in the  
<br>
calculus, use anything that appeals and reduces line count.  I use  
<br>
Python most of the time myself for screwing around with AI stuff, but  
<br>
the highly optimized C versions of the same complex algorithms are  
<br>
about 10^2 - 10^3 times faster and use about 10x less memory.   
<br>
Languages like Java can be somewhere in the middle when optimized.
<br>
<p>I was not saying that C was great for everything, just that C is hard  
<br>
to touch for raw performance potential if you bother to spend some  
<br>
time with it.  For many things, raw performance does not matter  
<br>
enough to be worth the time.  TANSTAAFL.  Pick the right tool for the  
<br>
right job and realize that sometimes you cannot have your cake and  
<br>
eat it too.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
