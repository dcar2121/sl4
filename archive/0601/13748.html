<p>*** START DIGRESSION ***
<br>
<p>This is an ancient argument on transhumanist email lists,
<br>
which historically stems from the fact that most Extropians
<br>
are Randians and libertarians who are fans of Julian Simon
<br>
and never studied ecology and have very negative
<br>
connotations attached to the words &quot;ecology&quot; and
<br>
&quot;environment&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;Scarcity&quot; in the Julian Simon sense has to do with price,
<br>
and with refuting people who claim that civilization will grind
<br>
to a halt because we'll run out of fresh water and copper.
<br>
<p>&quot;Scarcity&quot; in the sense we are discussing now has to do
<br>
with the fact that any resources that can be used to reproduce
<br>
or to satisfy a creature's wants or needs, will in a short time
<br>
no longer be free for the taking.  I'm not claiming that these
<br>
resources will vanish, or even that their &quot;price&quot; will be very
<br>
high.  The important point is that many entities will want these
<br>
resources.
<br>
<p>I don't think this is relevant to the ethical discussion anyway.
<br>
*** END DIGRESSION ***
<br>
<p>What is so hard about
<br>
<em>&gt; substituting a mechanical gazelle for the hunting pleasure of a real lion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do the same thing with my cats using string instead of mice.  Real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gazelles don't need to be bled to death by lions to enjoy their lives.
</em><br>
<p>We stand in relation to a posthuman AI in the same way that the lion
<br>
stands to us.
<br>
<p>A solution in which whoever happens to be the most powerful species
<br>
decides what everybody gets to do and enforces it - the approach you
<br>
are suggesting - is unacceptable.  That is what would happen by
<br>
default, if we fail to think about the problem now.  Think about what
<br>
would happen to humans under such a system.
<br>
<p>The lion must continue to be allowed to hunt and kill gazelles.  That
<br>
is the starting point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are ways to artificially push an ecology's energy requirements to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system's max resources (make a trillion gazelles).  I don't think we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this until we can safely discover exactly how much energy we have to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with in the universe.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we &quot;should&quot;, but we know that &quot;we&quot; will, because that is
<br>
how ecosystems work.  SOMEBODY is going to use those resources. 
<br>
Resources are never left lying around unused for long.  I have been
<br>
trying to explain this to transhumanists for 15 years now.  Why is
<br>
this so hard for transhumanists in particular to accept?  I suppose
<br>
because they are infected with extropian memes that preach the joy of
<br>
expansion unsullied by any problems with conflicts or resource
<br>
contentions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You want to maintain the &quot;law&quot; of ecology but outlaw common-sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;humane rights&quot;?  The moralists you speak so highly of, are all wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't speak of anyone highly, and I don't know what positions
<br>
you're suggesting these moralists all take (hint: some of them take
<br>
different positions).
<br>
<p>&quot;Common-sense&quot; is different for humans than for lions.  That is the problem.
<br>
<p>I think cats would have been an interesting dominant species.  They
<br>
would transcend much faster, then blow themselves up.  Because if you
<br>
left a hyperintelligent cat in a room with a button, and said, &quot;This
<br>
button will blow up the earth if you press it&quot;, the cat would still
<br>
HAVE to press the button.
