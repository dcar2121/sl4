Rick,
<br>
<p>The only significant point on your list was number 7:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; 7. We can practically demonstrate to possess an AGI.
</em><br>
<p>I have looked at the extremely ambitious claims you make on your 
<br>
website, and on that basis, I will now ask you directly if your PIBOT 
<br>
will submit itself to the test I outlined in one of my recent posts, thus:
<br>
<p>I will ask PIBOT several questions.  These will be designed to stretch 
<br>
it to the limits of its cognitive powers.  The first set of questions I 
<br>
will give you now, so your machine has time to prepare. Others must be 
<br>
answered in real time, and they will be of a similar level of subtlety 
<br>
as these, although they will not require PIBOT to do extensive research 
<br>
the way that these questions do:
<br>
<p>1) Give an introduction to Heim's theory of quantum gravity, in 
<br>
sufficient detail to allow a Physics graduate to understand it.
<br>
<p>2) You are living in a hovel in northern England, some time in the Dark 
<br>
Ages, and when you open your door and look outside one morning, you hear 
<br>
a fragment of a T.S. Eliot poem come to you (suitably translated into 
<br>
your vernacular) through a time warp.  You smile with recognition. 
<br>
Explain why you smiled and what you heard.
<br>
<p>3) Might Igor Stravinsky have had any opinion on the subject of motor 
<br>
scooters?  Why?
<br>
<p>When the remaining questions are asked in real time, your machine will 
<br>
be required to respond in any human language that is currently spoken by 
<br>
more than 1 million people.  I will specify which language to use for 
<br>
each question, but I will give only one second's notice of the language.
<br>
<p>When will PIBOT be ready to take this test?
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.

<em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the last few days RGE Corp. has carefully read all the threads posted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on SL4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First of all, we want to compliment Ben Goerztel's intelligence and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental insight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Altougth we don't personally know Ben, we have seen all the works and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas published
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by him during the last years, and we admire him, his vision and his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capacity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go deeply into all AI issues and scenarios (in substance: Ben, we are on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same wavelength!!!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In regards to the millionaire businessman on the bus, the first thing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he don't have to do is call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (by phone) Machiavellians that can bring him to ruin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, voilà some of my considerations:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Anybody today can practically demonstrate to possess an AGI could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth 100 Microsofts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Anybody today can practically demonstrate to possess an AGI could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth 1000 Googles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. AGI is a benevolent invention, that should be used for FRIENDLY 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes, and will be able to help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mankind in a billion of ways (for example, AGI could accelerate the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific research and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological progress in any field of human activity - it is reductive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cite an instance - cleverly crunching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bulks of data and information that the human mind will not ever be able 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to handle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. AGI, anybody has created it, will never cut off anyone, but it will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represent an enormous opportunity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both for the investors, both for the entrepreneurs, both for the work of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all scientists, of all researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and of all technicians belonging to the most various fields and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disciplines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5. AGI is not a threat for anyone (diseases are threats, also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earthquakes, hurricanes too, even fools).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6. We have detailed plans to handle AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7. We can practically demonstrate to possess an AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8. If you deny the need to have an AGI today, then you are stopping the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution (perhaps you like dinosaurs!).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amen.
</em><br>
