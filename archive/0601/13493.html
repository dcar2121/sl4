</em><br>
<p>Sometimes people can be hypnotized by difficult choices.  One recalls 
<br>
Elrond, in Tolkien's prehistory to _The Lord of the Rings_, pleading 
<br>
with Isildur to throw the Ring into Mount Doom.  In the movie version we 
<br>
get to see this (and as far as I know, it's faithful to Tolkien): 
<br>
Elrond and Isildur actually standing at the Crack of Doom, Isildur 
<br>
holding up the Ring, and then...
<br>
<p>Elrond:   Throw in the Ring!
<br>
Isildur:  Nah.
<br>
Elrond:   Okay.
<br>
<p>So what should Elrond have done?  Push Isildur screaming into the Crack 
<br>
of Doom?  A fine deed that would have been, to set to the credit of the 
<br>
Ring...  So Elrond let Isildur go, resulting in some untold number of 
<br>
casualties in the War of the Ring a few centuries later.
<br>
<p>Should we blame Elrond for that?  Well, if it was me, I sure would blame 
<br>
myself.  Just because I have ethics doesn't mean I'm not responsible for 
<br>
their consequences.
<br>
<p>Plus the Ring killed Isildur anyway.
<br>
And Isildur was lucky.  He could have ended up as Gollum.
<br>
<p>Elrond had plenty of options besides pushing Isildur into Mount Doom. 
<br>
He could have bopped Isildur on the head and then used his sword to 
<br>
nudge the Ring off the edge.  Worst case scenario, Elrond bops Isildur 
<br>
on the head, calls in his lieutenants, strips off his own armor, and 
<br>
*volunteers* to be pushed into Mount Doom if he can't manage to nudge 
<br>
off the Ring, throw off the Ring, or step off the edge.  If Elrond 
<br>
wasn't willing to sacrifice himself, he was *obligated* to call for 
<br>
volunteers, and if that made him feel awful that was *his* problem.
<br>
<p>Elrond was so focused on the obvious wrong way to solve the problem that 
<br>
he didn't see the creative right ways.  His great failure wasn't that he 
<br>
lacked ethics, it was that he didn't know how to use them.  He thought 
<br>
his ethics were supposed to be heroic disadvantages.  If Elrond had just 
<br>
taken for *granted* that he couldn't push Isildur off the edge, instead 
<br>
of agonizing, he would have seen easier and better solutions.
<br>
<p>It won't always be that way.  We don't live in so kind a universe.  But 
<br>
for Elrond it was so, even without Tolkien intending it.
<br>
<p>Did anyone else notice this, when they read the book, or watched the movie?
<br>
<p>The theory behind the Singularity Institute is that it's possible to 
<br>
*save the entire damn world* without killing people, pointing guns at 
<br>
people, telling people what to do, or any of the usual bullying 
<br>
tribal-chief solutions that instantly pop into people's heads when they 
<br>
consider political problems.  That's not idealism, it's intelligence. 
<br>
History teaches us that the &quot;difficult&quot; choices, the obvious wrong ways 
<br>
to solve the problem, DON'T FRICKIN' WORK.  Stalin broke plenty of eggs, 
<br>
but where are the omelets?
<br>
<p>So don't make excuses in advance for ethical failures.  People are so 
<br>
hypnotized by &quot;difficult&quot; choices that they don't look *hard* for a 
<br>
creative solution.  They just go straight off and make the &quot;difficult&quot; 
<br>
choice.  Taking the &quot;difficult&quot; option is not difficult, it's easy and 
<br>
convenient.  That's why people spend so much time looking for excuses to 
<br>
do things the &quot;difficult&quot; way.
<br>
<p>So what's really difficult?  Thinking.  It can be frickin' hard to think 
<br>
of a good solution, you've got to, like, actually sit down and 
<br>
concentrate.  And sometimes, yes, it's painful and inconvenient - for 
<br>
*yourself*, not some convenient outside victim who has to be 
<br>
&quot;sacrificed&quot; - to do things the right way.  It's not always easy.  So 
<br>
don't make your excuses in advance, or you'll shoot yourself down before 
<br>
you start.
<br>
