<p>Giu1i0,
<br>
<p>You have just said two things that many others have said in this 
<br>
discussion, with various different choices of phrasing:
<br>
<p>1)  &quot;I would be interested in seing some experimental result
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that actually proves something one way or another.&quot;
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>2)  &quot;I sense some &quot;religious fervor&quot; in both camps that does
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not seem too scientific.&quot;
<br>
<p>My responses are:
<br>
<p>1)  Damien and I have repeatedly stated that there are enormous numbers 
<br>
of experimental reports published in journals, any of which could be 
<br>
read by anyone on this list if they wished.  There are literally 
<br>
hundreds (and quite likely thousands) of reported experiments, of 
<br>
varying quality, but all conforming to the best standards of the 
<br>
research that you would find in, say, the mainstream psychology 
<br>
literature.  But in spite of the fact that Damien and I have said this, 
<br>
the responders have carried on repeating the myth that there are no 
<br>
reliable experiments, and that they would like to see some.
<br>
<p>All sorts of objections have been raised, but these have either been 
<br>
addressed by Damien and I (mostly by Damien, who has had more patience 
<br>
than I), or we have pointed out that the objections are well known and 
<br>
have been considered in great depth in the parapsychology journals. 
<br>
Some of these objections, while sincere and carefully considered, are so 
<br>
easy to refute that it is almost embarrassing.  (Would anyone like to 
<br>
succintly summarize what the objections are, btw?).
<br>
<p>So:  people request an &quot;experimental result that actually proves 
<br>
something one way or another&quot; and we point out where those results can 
<br>
be found and mention the degree of reliability you will find when you 
<br>
read the reports.  But then what happens?  We find ourselves getting hit 
<br>
with the same question, over and over, as if we had said nothing!
<br>
<p><p><p>2)  Ummmm .... where is the &quot;unscientific religious fervor&quot;, exactly? 
<br>
When have Damien and I been doing this?  All we have tried to do is 
<br>
summarize what people would find if they read the published scientific 
<br>
literature on the subject.
<br>
<p>Please, if you would, catalog the examples of &quot;unscientific religious 
<br>
fervor&quot; that you find objectionable in the two camps and give us a 
<br>
summary of percentages.   The percentage of ad hominem abuse?  The 
<br>
number of times that someone has said something that does not involve 
<br>
pointing people toward empirical data?
<br>
<p>[NO, please don't:  it would be a monstrous waste of your time!  The 
<br>
request was rhetorical.]
<br>
