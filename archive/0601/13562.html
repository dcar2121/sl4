<p>
The article you cite rides roughshod over all the carefully delineated 
<br>
positions in philosophy of mind as if they didn't exist, and it is just 
<br>
downright wrong about this:
<br>
<p>&quot;...all electrical circuits - and that’s basically all neurones are – 
<br>
generate an associated energy field, known as an electromagnetic field 
<br>
or em field. This field contains precisely the same information as the 
<br>
circuitry that generated it. However, unlike neuronal information, which 
<br>
is localised in single or groups of neurons, the brain’s em field will 
<br>
bind the neuronal information into a single integrated whole.&quot;
<br>
<p>The EM field does not contain precisely the same information as the 
<br>
circuitry that generated it, it smears it into a mess that cannot be 
<br>
completely untangled.  Fromn the physics POV this article is riddled 
<br>
with nonsense, and from the philosophy of mind POV it is also riddled 
<br>
with nonsense.
