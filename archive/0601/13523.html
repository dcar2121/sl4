desire - is often overloaded with emotional connotation, but if an AI were
<br>
developed to be driven by the aquisition of new information then it could be
<br>
discussed as a need/want/desire/compulsion/etc. to do so.  In early
<br>
projects, it will probably be possible for the team of humans developing the
<br>
initial state to bias these directives.  Once AI starts seeding their own
<br>
descendants, we may be examining the new creation with an approach similar
<br>
to anthropologists or sociologists.
<br>
<p>interesting - there is a large volume of information/fact that can be
<br>
observed and compiled that has little use in advancing global thought.  Much
<br>
of the minutiae becomes unimportant once a governing rule is discovered.
<br>
Sure, it would be &quot;interesting&quot; to note that for a process of sorting N
<br>
items that one algorithm achieves O(n) vs O(log n) and an AI that
<br>
understands the use of each is certainly interesting.  Once those classes of
<br>
computing are discovered and understood, it would become &quot;uninteresting&quot; to
<br>
repeatedly test/prove the efficiency of one method or another using
<br>
increasing values of N.
<br>
<p>I was really just making an observation about the fact that torture does not
<br>
have to be chemical.  I think HAL from the movie 2001 may have expressed
<br>
greater 'concern' for his mental health (ability to function within optimal
<br>
parameters) as Dave Bowman turned off the HAL-equivalent of &quot;higher&quot; brain
<br>
function and memory.  Given the scenario of forcing a self-aware neural net
<br>
to train on incorrect assumptions then being allowed to realize the
<br>
fundamental error is equivalent to mental abuse.
