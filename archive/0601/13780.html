<p>
I have been interested in this question of what would be done about 
<br>
suffering in the rest of the Earth's ecology for a long time, and I must 
<br>
admit I find it really difficult.
<br>
<p>The working solution that I came up with in my own limited thinking was 
<br>
that *if* I believed that unnecessary suffering is wrong, when it is 
<br>
inflicted on a sentient being (and I do, with a nod to the fact that 
<br>
&quot;unnecessary&quot; is not easy to define), then I might suggest taking some 
<br>
action such as the following.
<br>
<p>Insert into the brain of any higher organism (anything with sentience 
<br>
above a certain level) a small device that is able to quickly send it 
<br>
into unconsciousness if it was exposed to unnecessarily cruelty 
<br>
inflicted on it by another animal.
<br>
<p>If I did this, I could feel that I had done something to minimize 
<br>
unnecessary suffering, whilst not tampering with the normal flow of 
<br>
nature.  It would not have zero impact (I can see my cats getting pissed 
<br>
off that the mice stop moving very quickly after they start playing with 
<br>
them ... although we could talk about fixes for even that problem), but 
<br>
the impact would be very small.
<br>
<p>The intriguing thing is that nature already probably does do something 
<br>
of this sort.  I suspect that in many cases the animal lapses into 
<br>
unconsciousness very quickly when things go badly wrong.  Clearly not 
<br>
always, however.
<br>
<p>(One complication is that fear of suffering is perhaps the greatest 
<br>
actual component of suffering.  What do you do about that?)
<br>
<p>Overall, I am in favor of having a Prime Directive, but with the small 
<br>
amendment described above.  Does anyone think that makes sense?
<br>
<p>I tend to agree with Phil that if we throw away the Prime Directive, we 
<br>
get sucked into responsibility for all &quot;suffering&quot; in a way that seems 
<br>
to have no limits.  If you draw the line somewhere, why not very close 
<br>
to where things are right now?
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
