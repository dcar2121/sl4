<em>&gt; I think a stability analysis might be more appropriate.  The greatest

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; falling into a suicidal state increase with the size of the network,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; life that an individual can have! (where &quot;amount of life&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximated by the complexity of that organism's brain summed over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am reminded of the 'stowaways' in the seed-reality in Greg Egan's
<br>
&quot;Permutation City&quot; - after having lived until boredom with an arbitrarily
<br>
large number of professions and perspective on life, the male character
<br>
decided to become a &quot;Solipsist Nation&quot; and fracture himself into an entire
<br>
civilisation of individuals his girlfriend could interact with.  I vaguely
<br>
recall another character becoming so tired of trying to aquire new
<br>
experiences, that his subjective reality was reduced to the encoding of the
<br>
single moment of elation caused by rapelling down a mountain, which was then
<br>
experienced repeatedly.
<br>
<p>Consider (and extend) this anology:  Existance as a single polyp of coral.
<br>
At the end of that existance, awareness is increased to the resulting reef,
<br>
though still as a 'coral' awareness.  (perhaps running over the original
<br>
point in time, from a larger subjective sense of self in spacial
<br>
dimensions)  After that keyspace of the states of awareness is exhausted,
<br>
the spatial sense of self is increased again and time starts over from
<br>
zero.  If each increment in time at each successive level required
<br>
progression through every previous point at each previous level, the
<br>
subjective value of time on each level would be constant - but from some
<br>
conceptual outside position, the amount of computational work would increase
<br>
factorially.  (Ok, so NOW i think of the Towers of Hanoi as a simpler
<br>
computational example, but the richness of the polyp/coral/reef example
<br>
helped visualize my point)
