<p>The question of being forced to live certain ways because the FAI
<br>
knows best will never arise.
<br>
<p>When the singularity AI appears you will worship and love them. 
<br>
Altering human brains as required will be done according to the
<br>
objectives of the FAI.
<br>
<p>It may decide to go away and leave humanity alone or it may decide to
<br>
'improve' humanity. But if it decides to stick around, humanity will
<br>
be happy with whatever the FAI decides.
<br>
<p>Do you really think humanity will remain the same, discussing with a
<br>
sort of more powerful than usual dictator how we would like him to run
<br>
the country?
<br>
Come on!  :)
