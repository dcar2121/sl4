<p>
I was not about to prove a point, but to throw out the idea that psi
<br>
&quot;results&quot; may be so heavily observer dependant that for any significantly
<br>
large measure of time, (or other computational data) the likelihood of
<br>
isolating a specific influence from the background noise of chaotic forces
<br>
would currently be too difficult to be reproducible.
<br>
<p>If Schroedinger's neighbor hated cats, would he exist in a superposition of
<br>
happiness that the particle decayed and unhappiness that it did not?  I
<br>
believe we exist in a superposition of infinite states inside a singularity
<br>
of experience.  That experience can be remembered or predicted or just
<br>
observed, but the realization of any given state redefines the meaning of
<br>
all others.  We're all stuck trying to conceive of that moment when the
<br>
singularity is again realized.  If my current understanding of 'singularity'
<br>
differs from that of this list, please illuminate my flaw so I can correct
<br>
my thought model.
