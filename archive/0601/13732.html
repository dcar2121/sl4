<p>Not really - Last I checked, which was admittedly before
<br>
the crash, a venture capitalist needed about
<br>
a 30-40% yearly return on investment to invest in
<br>
anything risky.  A mutual fund can return
<br>
about 10% yearly before inflation.  A galactic survey would
<br>
be a risky investment.  Let's say that it would not be done
<br>
unless it returned, at a bare minimum, 20% a year.  Figure
<br>
out what the return has to be if you don't get paid
<br>
back for 100 million years.  Not to mention that the
<br>
original investors would not expect to be around in
<br>
100 million years, regardless of any life-extension
<br>
technology; things change too much for identities to
<br>
remain recognizable over that time period.
<br>
<p>I think that, for economic reasons and due to an increased
<br>
pace of events, people will have shorter, not longer, planning
<br>
timespans in a posthuman world.  People may refuse to make
<br>
investments or plans beyond a horizon of one month.  Inflation,
<br>
which is related to the subjective rate of time (how much &quot;stuff
<br>
happens&quot; over a time span, not how many seconds pass),
<br>
might be considered under control if it's less than 2% a week,
<br>
in a civilization of AIs for whom one week was like one year
<br>
to us.  Under those circumstances, your galactic survey might
<br>
need to make a return on investment of 20% per week, 13,105%
<br>
per year.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the Fermi paradox is because, in any civilization advanced
<br>
enough to colonize the stars, time is so valuable that an
<br>
investment in intersolar travel is never worthwhile.  As technology
<br>
advances, the amount of &quot;stuff done per time unit&quot; increases,
<br>
but the time it takes to travel thru space never changes,
<br>
so that space travel rapidly becomes more and more
<br>
economically infeasible, regardless of any technological advances.
<br>
Even if propulsion were free, any entity intelligent enough to perform
<br>
your survey could perform tasks with more return-on-investment
<br>
without leaving home.
