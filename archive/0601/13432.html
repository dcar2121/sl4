At 12:47 PM 1/3/2006 -0600, I challenged John Clark:
<br>
<p>&lt; Please provide a list of the parapsychologists at the Rhine Institute, 
<br>
University of Edinburgh, University of Northampton, University of Amsterdam 
<br>
and other established centers of academic parapsychology who cite Robert 
<br>
Anton Wilson as an authority. Even three names would be useful to test the 
<br>
credibility of your claim. Which of the peer reviewed journals in 
<br>
parapsychology have Wilson as one of their referees? &gt;
<br>
<p>No reply, so I approached several parapsychologists. One replied:
<br>
<p>&lt; I confess I have never heard of Robert Anton Wilson. I have been studying 
<br>
the literature in parapsychologoy for over 25 years.  And I haven't limited 
<br>
myself to reading only the academic scholarly work ...
<br>
<p>So based on my own experience... I would not say that Wilson can be 
<br>
considered a representative of scientific parapsychology, or even a popular 
<br>
spokesperson for the field.  I certainly would not accept the description 
<br>
of him as one of the authorities to support their claims and as peers for 
<br>
their &quot;peer reviewed journals&quot;. &gt;
<br>
<p>Another, who knows Wilson, said:
<br>
<p>&lt; to my knowledge, he has no standing -- whatsoever --in the field of 
<br>
professional parapsychology. I rather doubt that his critique of CSICOP was 
<br>
even reviewed in any of the professional journals. And, I do not recall 
<br>
ever seeing him at any gathering of parapsychologists.
<br>
<p>This confusion, amongst the general public, between popular figures who 
<br>
write about psi and those who approach the field professionally is 
<br>
extremely common. I'm sure other fields of science also have this problem 
<br>
-- but I suspect it is more true of parapsychology than, probably, any 
<br>
other field. &gt;
<br>
<p>Exactly. It's as rather if one were to despise and denounce quantum 
<br>
theorists and experimenters on the grounds that Deepak Chopra, Fritjof 
<br>
Capra's and Danah Zohar gabble about QT in their new age drivel.
