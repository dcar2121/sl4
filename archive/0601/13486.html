Just a wee bit of wild speculation I had:
<br>
<p>Let's consider universes in which some other intelligent species
<br>
developed slightly before us, sent out Non Newman replicators or
<br>
somesuch.
<br>
<p>Well, if they had, then we'd expect to see such probes and perhaps
<br>
them all over... But wait, if they were, especially via the Von Newman
<br>
spamming of the galaxy, including our own personal favorite planet,
<br>
where would we evolve?
<br>
<p>ie, I'm going to suggest the possibility that once at least one
<br>
species has spammed the galaxy with replicators or themselves or
<br>
something, then it'd be much less likely that human (or human like)
<br>
life could then develop, since the resources of the world would
<br>
already be in the process of being munched on by the replicators and
<br>
or the members of the species themselves. Any galaxy already taken
<br>
over would have less places and/or opportunity for something
<br>
&quot;essentially like us&quot; (leave it to you do decide what the proper
<br>
reference class is here) to develop.
<br>
<p>So we may then be able to validly say that we have no right to be
<br>
supprised at the lack of signs of such, since the lack of such may be
<br>
a near prequesite for us existing.
<br>
<p>Of course, we'd also expect as a prior &quot;number of galaxies in all
<br>
possible universes with something showing up sufficiently before
<br>
humans to 'take over' before we show up&quot; &gt; &quot;number of galaxies in
<br>
which we're among the first, sufficiently early at least that
<br>
nothing's 'taken over' yet.&quot;
<br>
<p>So the exact relation of p(humans developing | someone else took over
<br>
first) * p(someone else took first) vs p(humans developing | noone
<br>
took over first) * p(no one took over first) is the question. My claim
<br>
is that the second conditional is significantly larger than the first,
<br>
and my wild eyed speculation is that the ratio is sufficiently large
<br>
compared to the ratio of the first prior to the second that we
<br>
shouldn't actually be supprised at, well, at the Fermi &quot;paradox&quot;
<br>
<p>Or is this all just complete nonsense? :)
