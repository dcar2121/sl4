</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree roughly with your conclusions, but this reasoning is like
<br>
saying that the universe is boring because it has a finite # of
<br>
states.  Simplify the brain's state as being the collection of on/off
<br>
states of its 10^(10 or 11, let's say 11) neurons.  Then it has
<br>
2^(10^11) = 10^(log(2)*10^11) states.  Compare that to the age of the
<br>
universe in tenths of a second (about 10^18.5).
<br>
<p>If you can bring the switching time of your brain down to 10^-44
<br>
seconds, instead of a tenth of a second, you will have to add 143
<br>
neurons to make up for that change.
<br>
<p>I suspect that if you worked it out, you would come to the heat death
<br>
of the universe before a human brain needed to repeat state.  If not,
<br>
add another hundred neurons.
<br>
<p>I think a stability analysis might be more appropriate.  The greatest
<br>
risk to a Great Old One is suicide.  Equate suicidal thoughts with
<br>
instability of some model.  It might then turn out that the odds of
<br>
falling into a suicidal state increase with the size of the network,
<br>
so that the best strategy for living forever is to simplify your
<br>
brain, and so that there is a (probabilistic) maximum on the amount of
<br>
life that an individual can have! (where &quot;amount of life&quot; is
<br>
approximated by the complexity of that organism's brain summed over
<br>
time)
<br>
<p>You could probably add stability to a model with N neurons by
<br>
increasing redundancy, but that would impose a computational cost that
<br>
might scale faster than N.  In that case, there would definitely be an
<br>
upper limit on the expected life total possible for an individual!
<br>
<p>(I don' tthink that talking about strange attractors, BTW, solves the
<br>
problem Eliezer is talking about - they occur in real-valued state
<br>
spaces, while we're talking about a digitized brain model with a
<br>
digital state space.  (If the brain is analog, of course, then Eli's
<br>
argument is a non-starter.  But then Eli will come back with some
<br>
quantum mechanics, to which I will respond with a similar argument
<br>
about heat death of the universe.))
