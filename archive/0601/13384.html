It has been pointed out that I should provide a reference to the 
<br>
experiment that I referred to below:  the one I know of was done by Carl 
<br>
Sargent, but I cannot remember which one.  Will have to do some 
<br>
checking.  Heck, I'm out of date on this stuff:  I stopped doing 
<br>
parapsychology back in the mid-80s.
<br>
<p>More generally, though, it is difficult for me to pick one reference on 
<br>
this:  if you go to the literature and look up &quot;sheep-goat effect&quot; you 
<br>
should find hundreds of examples.

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Amongst psi researchers, it is already well known that the presence of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptics as *subjects* does have an interesting effect on some kinds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments:  they seem to make the scoring go significantly *below* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance.  Who knows why:  you can pick your own interpretation of what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be going on.  This is called the &quot;sheep-goat effect&quot; and it has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been known for a long time.  The effect was robust enough in at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one experiment I knew of, that the difference between believers and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptics was highly significant, whereas the overall rate was (I think) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And for your more general question, people have considered that in great 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail, too:  some people tried to understand how layers of influence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extending out in time from the original observation could conceivably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sum to leave an actual result that was non-chance.  Don't ask me what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the latest thoughts are on that one.
