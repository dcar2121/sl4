My comment was not a reply to any statement made in this specific
<br>
thread, in particular from you or from Damien. I thought I was not
<br>
quoting anyone, but I quoted Damien's reply. I already apologized to
<br>
Damien offlist. It was a general comment on psi research.
<br>
And yes, I see a lot of &quot;religious fervor&quot; on both camps, I would say
<br>
equally distributed.

<em>&gt;  &gt; G.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Giu1i0,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have just said two things that many others have said in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion, with various different choices of phrasing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  &quot;I would be interested in seing some experimental result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       that actually proves something one way or another.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  &quot;I sense some &quot;religious fervor&quot; in both camps that does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       not seem too scientific.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My responses are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Damien and I have repeatedly stated that there are enormous numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of experimental reports published in journals, any of which could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read by anyone on this list if they wished.  There are literally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds (and quite likely thousands) of reported experiments, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; varying quality, but all conforming to the best standards of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research that you would find in, say, the mainstream psychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature.  But in spite of the fact that Damien and I have said this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the responders have carried on repeating the myth that there are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reliable experiments, and that they would like to see some.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All sorts of objections have been raised, but these have either been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed by Damien and I (mostly by Damien, who has had more patience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than I), or we have pointed out that the objections are well known and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been considered in great depth in the parapsychology journals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of these objections, while sincere and carefully considered, are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy to refute that it is almost embarrassing.  (Would anyone like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succintly summarize what the objections are, btw?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So:  people request an &quot;experimental result that actually proves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something one way or another&quot; and we point out where those results can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be found and mention the degree of reliability you will find when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read the reports.  But then what happens?  We find ourselves getting hit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the same question, over and over, as if we had said nothing!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Ummmm .... where is the &quot;unscientific religious fervor&quot;, exactly?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When have Damien and I been doing this?  All we have tried to do is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summarize what people would find if they read the published scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literature on the subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please, if you would, catalog the examples of &quot;unscientific religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fervor&quot; that you find objectionable in the two camps and give us a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summary of percentages.   The percentage of ad hominem abuse?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of times that someone has said something that does not involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointing people toward empirical data?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [NO, please don't:  it would be a monstrous waste of your time!  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; request was rhetorical.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
