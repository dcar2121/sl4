<p>
I have something of an idea about attempting to apply some Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning principles in terms of a standard Texas Hold 'em game.
<br>
<p>The purpose of the application would be to take into account probabilities 
<br>
in terms of a single player's hand at each stage of betting, as well as 
<br>
parameters associated with raises, blinds, etc (against human opponents). 
<br>
These factors would be taken into account using principles and functions 
<br>
associated with BPT and expected utility.
<br>
<p>There are multiple possible uses of this concept, including real monetary 
<br>
benefit (based on improved observer centered expected utility estimation in 
<br>
terms of options and parameters. Ultimately the idea is to attempt to 
<br>
establish a decent shot at a normative estimation, after much improvement, 
<br>
or at least a stronger understanding of some basic principles of Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning and expected utility)
<br>
<p>It would take a little math, a good bit of programming, and a few strokes of 
<br>
insight.
<br>
<p>Let me know if interested.
