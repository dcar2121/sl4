<p><p>Well yes. The best of the best technical people are normally severely
<br>
lacking in people skills (or at least don't develop them until much later in
<br>
life than average). If you can find counterexamples, great! (I'm certainly
<br>
not one of them.) But if you're relying on counterexamples, well, you may be
<br>
waiting some time.

<p>I'd rather teach a brilliant person math/programming than teach them
<br>
<em>&gt; how to communicate, self-control, emotional stability, etc.
</em><br>
<p><p>That only works if the person is willing to do what it takes to learn
<br>
math/programming. If you find someone who has communication ability,
<br>
self-control, emotional stability etc, that usually implies they've had more
<br>
common sense than to spend years of their lives sitting in a basement
<br>
staring at a computer screen; and if they weren't willing to do that before,
<br>
they're probably not willing to do it now.
