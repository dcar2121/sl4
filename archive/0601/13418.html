On Tue, 3 Jan 2006 &quot;Thomas Buckner&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:tcbevolver@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20testing%20psi.">tcbevolver@yahoo.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert Anton Wilson has a side project called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CSICON, or &quot;Committee for Surrealistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Investigation of Claims Of the Normal.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's been down on Randi for decades 
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly why people like me hold psi researchers in such low
<br>
regard, they use ideas of people like Robert Anton Wilson as authorities
<br>
to support their claims and as peers for their
<br>
“peer reviewed journals”. The man is a fool and I’ll tell you why. 
<br>
<p>Even by junk science standards the work of Immanuel Velikousky is really
<br>
really stupid. He says that in historic times the planet Jupiter spit
<br>
out a &quot;comet&quot; that collided with Earth and bounced off and then, through
<br>
various gravitational gymnastics, parted the Red Sea and somehow caused
<br>
all the miracles in the old testament. This &quot;comet&quot; then went into a
<br>
circular orbit around the sun and became the planet Venus! To call this
<br>
idea idiotic would be a unjust insult to all the fine self respecting
<br>
idiots of the world. The late great Carl Sagan had great fun pocking
<br>
holes in this ignorant theory, not that that's what made him great, it
<br>
was too easy, like shooting fish in 
<br>
a barrel.
<br>
<p>While poking around in the Science section of my local bookstore some
<br>
years ago I ran across a misfiled book that belonged in the &quot;new age&quot;
<br>
section next to the UFO and Bigfoot books, it was called &quot;Carl Sagan and
<br>
Immanuel Velikousky&quot; by Charles Ginenthal. I didn't read it, but after
<br>
thumbing through it for 5 minutes I could see it was a revolting attack
<br>
on the life of Sagan and a deification of Velikousky. On the back of the
<br>
book was a blurb by Robert Anton Wilson, he said this trash was &quot;an
<br>
excellent and erudite destruction of Saganism&quot;. If a man like that also
<br>
doesn’t like Randi then Randi must be doing something right.
