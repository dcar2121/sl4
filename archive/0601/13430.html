Phil, I think your interesting hypothesis is worth exploring. There are a
<br>
few signal sources in the ULF and lower-ELF range (capable of easily
<br>
penetrating most objects on the Earth, including brains and Faraday cages,
<br>
despite the common misinformation that it is blocked by Faraday cages) that
<br>
could be involved and that I've been researching for several years. One is
<br>
the Schumann resonance [1] of the Earth-ionosphere cavity resonance
<br>
(averaging 7.83 Hz). Another is the ambient 10 Hz resonant frequency of the
<br>
Earth itself. And another is the global electrical grid (50 and 60 Hz).
<br>
Other sources are noted by the peaks on the Spectrum of the Earth-ionosphere
<br>
cavity resonances chart [2]. One experiment would be to statistically test
<br>
correlations of REG [3] derived data and geophysical data [1]. I've
<br>
discussed this with one of the PEAR researchers and hope to do some
<br>
experimental biophysics lab work in this area. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Relevance to the Singularity: one question I'm interested in is: what are
<br>
the upper bounds in human neural processing speed (and other processing
<br>
parameters) in augmented humans and the possible influence of
<br>
electromagnetic fields and quantum events on merged human-computer
<br>
consciousness, especially if quantum computing is involved?  I'm also
<br>
exploring critical examinations of the Penrose-Hameroff quantum
<br>
consciousness hypothesis. These are questions that will be explored at a
<br>
forthcoming conference on &quot;Neuronanotechnology and the preservation of human
<br>
consciousness&quot; that I'm assisting in organizing [5]. I'll be discussing a
<br>
new book due out in February, The Emerging Physics of Consciousness, by two
<br>
of the speakers at that event (as well as Hameroff and others), on
<br>
KurzweilAI.net, covering this and other related issues. I welcome any
<br>
private emails on these subjects. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>As for the &quot;our own consciousness is real&quot; hypothesis, I'm not aware of any
<br>
supporting evidence or any method of falsifying the hypothesis.   :)

<br>
<p>How is &quot;having a modality at all to make sense of all of this&quot; weird in any
<br>
way.  It is the only thing we can be 100% sure of, that our own
<br>
consciousness is real.  The ONLY thing.  The fact that psi cannot be
<br>
reproduced using pseudo-random # generators proves we are not psychic.
<br>
Consciousness is an EM phenomenom.  So is a RNG.  This is more weird than
<br>
believing in ghosts (which I assume is your explanation. If not, what is?)?
<br>
David, I have just told you what psi is..  Why can't this thread die?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I was supposed to be reading about crystal formation patterns and carbon
<br>
nanotube defect densities last night.  Instead I spent a few hours
<br>
&quot;researching&quot; psi.  I figure it out and you tell me my explanation is too
<br>
weird?  You know whats really weird?  Cosmology.  Particle streams emitted
<br>
by stellar and other cosmic bodies.  EM brain waves.  Electrical surges.
<br>
Earth's magnetic fiel! d.  All too weird to be true I guess.  And
<br>
consciousness?  A figment of our &quot;unconsciousness imaginations&quot; I guess.
<br>
Someone refute my hypothesis plz.  It is the most reasonable explanation of
<br>
psi.

<p><em>&gt; Could it be that consciousness is an electrical phenomenom subject to

the same local-to-earth outside influences (cosmic particles affecting earth

or human body EM fields?) that are very quietly influencing the Random
<br>
Number Generators? This seems much more likely than positing psychic powers
<br>
and steamrolling General Relativity and/or Quantum Mechanics. No
<br>
procognition. But your mind can sense to some limited degree, a solar storm
<br>
or a distant past supernovae explosion. Neat.
<br>
<p>This would be just as weird and implausible. Generating a number is not
<br>
merely a matter of reading a physical magnitude, it requires a degree of
<br>
interpretation. For example, to generate numbers from sound you might encode
<br>
it as frequency or amplitude, this encoding requires units of reference, of
<br>
time, energy, etc. Believing that the mind and the RNG in question, even
<br>
when primed from the same source of randomness, would lead to the same
<br>
results is highly suspect. Having a modality at all to make sense of those
<br>
random data is already weird enough, having one which coincides with the
<br>
RNG's is weirder.
