<p>Neural networks are equivalent with Turing machines. Modern computers are 
<br>
equivalent with Turing machines. Our brains run software that nobody thus 
<br>
far has replicated with modern computers. Do you claim that if one did so, 
<br>
the outcome would not act like a human mind and would not have 
<br>
consciousness? (If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, what is 
<br>
it?)
<br>
<p>And yes, my answer to your question is yes. 
<br>
<p>A few decades ago biologists and philosophers had a big problem trying to 
<br>
understand what life is. There were philosophical debates on life and what 
<br>
it is. And there were people who were dead set that life could not happen 
<br>
just because of some chemical reactions. 
<br>
<p>Nowadays we know better. Cells are self-replicating machines and basically 
<br>
the whole concept of life is rather meaningless in scientific debate. 
<br>
<p>The materialists were right. It was the chemical reactions that cause 
<br>
these small machines to have self-replicating and other properties. 
<br>
<p>Same goes, I believe, for consciousness. Because we do not yet understand 
<br>
how that happens, we hold that as an important question, but it may be 
<br>
that in the final analysis it is not. It is the algorithms that compute 
<br>
and estimate good actions considering the input it has that are important. 
<br>
<p>I would suggest, in case you haven't, to get a good look at what theory of 
<br>
computing has to offer in understanding - well, theory of computation. And 
<br>
I would not read only the basics, like different kinds of languages and 
<br>
automata that exist and their properties. I would also take a good look at 
<br>
theory of computational complexity, especially on concurrency. And while 
<br>
you are at it, you could also get a basic understanding about neural 
<br>
networks.
<br>
<p>Good starting points are for example: M. Sipser, Introduction to the 
<br>
Theory of Computation (PWS Publishing 1997) or H. Lewis and C. 
<br>
Papadimitriou, Elements of the Theory of Computation (Prentice Hall 1998). 
<br>
<p>C. Papadimitriou: Computational Complexity, Addison-Wesley, 1994.
<br>
<p>S. Haykin: &quot;Neural Networks - a Comprehensive Foundation&quot;, 2nd edition, 
<br>
Prentice-Hall, 1998
