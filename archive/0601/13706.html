<p>
E.g., the prevalence of small
<br>
<em>&gt; asteroids, etc., might be high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough that there is a strong upper limit on speed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of the engine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you're using.  
</em><br>
<p>The fact that light from nearby stars is not
<br>
noticeably
<br>
blocked by interstellar junk sets a limit on how much
<br>
of
<br>
it there is.  At significant speeds, loose hydrogen
<br>
atoms
<br>
start looking like a particle beam aimed at you, and
<br>
there
<br>
are _some_ interstellar dust grains.  So you will need
<br>
a
<br>
leading edge shield on your spacecraft to protect you
<br>
from that stuff.  But that doesn't limit you to speeds
<br>
that solve the Fermi Paradox.
<br>
<p>Stars themselves move around.  Among the nearest stars
<br>
are
<br>
ones moving relative to the Sun at over 100 km/s.  So
<br>
simply
<br>
by moving arbitrarily slowly to such stars, then
<br>
riding
<br>
with that star for a while, and spreading to other
<br>
stars
<br>
when you pass by, you can fill the Galaxy by
<br>
'diffusion'
<br>
in a time (~300M years) much shorter than the age of
<br>
the
<br>
Galaxy.
<br>
<p>[note: I _am_ a rocket scientist]
<br>
<p>More likely, 
<br>
<em>&gt; there's the what's to gain? argument to explain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absence of robots.  If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody's willing to go, then why bother to send more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a photographer (if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that).  And photographers might well choose to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconspicuous, so as not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disrupt the scenery that they were shooting.
</em><br>
<p>There's information to gain.  Once you have the
<br>
ability
<br>
to build replicating systems, you can send out one or
<br>
a few
<br>
probes, whose decendants can survey the whole Galaxy
<br>
for you.
<br>
If they are built with the ability to communicate with
<br>
each other, you get back the survey information
<br>
without
<br>
leaving home, and you also have built a communications
<br>
network that can connect any civilizations in the
<br>
Galaxy
<br>
with each other.  Pretty big return on your intitial 
<br>
investment in probes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure that the Fermi Paradox needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answered, because there are so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many potential reasons, and plausibly different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; races would encounter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different reasons.  
</em><br>
<p>By trying to answer the Fermi Paradox, we will learn
<br>
about the Universe we live in and something about our
<br>
origin
<br>
and future.  That's enough reason for me.
<br>
<p>See work by Gerard O'Neill on why planets are not the
<br>
best places to live.  A sphere has the _minimum_
<br>
useable
<br>
surface area for a given mass, and most of the mass is
<br>
locked up deep inside where it is hard to get to.
