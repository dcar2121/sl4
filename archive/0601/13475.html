<p>
I have a theory...
<br>
<p>I've noticed that often when a topic starts to gain a degree of popularity, 
<br>
I start reacting in certain ways:
<br>
<p>I want to be _the first_ to respond in certain ways.  This is not good for 
<br>
mailing lists!
<br>
<p>Just say that Poster P has said &quot;X ;  Y ; if Y then Z ; therefore Z&quot; .
<br>
<p>If these are contentious, I will often want to say, for example: why X is 
<br>
wrong and why Y doesn't imply Z.  It's OK for me to want this.
<br>
<p>The trick is, that I generally want to be the first to say &quot;Not X&quot;.  
<br>
Furthermore, if I leave it up to others, I expect that they won't say 
<br>
everything they could about why X is wrong.  So I want to jump in right away 
<br>
to say my bit.
<br>
<p>I previously thought that this was a personality flaw specific to me.  
<br>
Looking back on some of the recent topics that generated lots of traffic, 
<br>
I'd say it's possibly a little more common.  People were obviously getting 
<br>
aggravated by the topic continuing to get traffic, and wanted to say 
<br>
&quot;SHADDUP!&quot;  but at the same time still had a strong urge to add &quot; But I just 
<br>
gotta say this one thing&quot;.
<br>
<p>Being fixated on having the last word is kinda selfish.  I think that's 
<br>
fairly plain, but that's not my point.
<br>
<p>Now, it is my experience that others will generally fail to say why &quot;not X&quot; 
<br>
in the best way possible.  However, many topics don't need everyone shouting 
<br>
out all the problems right away.  What I've come to believe is:
<br>
<p>*If the topic is important, it's worth adding an objection at a later date.  
<br>
If the objection can't wait, it's probably not worth saying*
<br>
<p>If one lets Poster Q's immediate, imperfect rebuttal that &quot;Not X&quot;, and leave 
<br>
responding for, say,  a week, we are generally in a better position to judge 
<br>
whether it's worth saying &quot;Not X&quot; in a better way, or whether the only thing 
<br>
that needs to be said is that &quot;Not Y --&gt; Z&quot;.
<br>
<p>I've seen people apologise for responding to posts months afterwards.  How 
<br>
does this match our shared objective of high quality discussion?  Surely, if 
<br>
something is relevant now, it will be equally relevant later.  I would have 
<br>
thought the only exception would be if the topic is specific to the 
<br>
circumstances of the moment.
<br>
