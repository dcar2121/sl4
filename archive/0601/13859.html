<p>Yes, I'm well aware of that.
<br>
<p>If our current model of physics is correct, we must eventually somehow 
<br>
jump to a universe with different laws of physics, or do something else 
<br>
creative, or die.  Current physical models should permit me to get all 
<br>
the living done which my current brain is large enough to actually want, 
<br>
so that problem I bequeath to my future self.  It'll probably be quite 
<br>
some time before I can realistically want something that would require 
<br>
me to escape the heat death of the universe.
<br>
<p>One suspects that laying down new memories, learning new skills, and 
<br>
becoming a person who can exist coherently with so much knowledge and 
<br>
capability, requires the brain to grow at a (hopefully sub-cubic) rate 
<br>
which leads into Great Old One territory much faster than the 
<br>
requirement of not repeating yourself.  But the part about not repeating 
<br>
yourself is easier to see mathematically.
<br>
<p>The point is that if you genuinely want to escape death, you have to 
<br>
become a Great Old One eventually.  And if you *can't* escape death, 
<br>
what is the point of *not* becoming a Great Old One?  It would seem 
<br>
obvious that *not* wanting to *eventually* become a Great Old One must 
<br>
be based *strictly* on a form of *very long term* death-fear, rather 
<br>
than desire for life, or fear of any localizable discontinuity.
<br>
<p>If you want life, Great Old Ones Have More Fun (or what's the point of 
<br>
being a Great Old One?)  If you're afraid of dying in the short term, 
<br>
you won't cease to be you next week.  You will never, from your 
<br>
perspective, cease to be you in the next week.  The argument against 
<br>
becoming a Great Old One is based on fear of *eventual* change, that if 
<br>
you dare to learn a little tomorrow, then you'll learn even more the day 
<br>
after that, and *eventually* your future self will be so different that 
<br>
your self of 2006 will have ceased to exist.  But your self of 2006 
<br>
cannot live forever as a pre-Singularity human, whether because of the 
<br>
heat death of the universe, or because there's a finite number of 
<br>
available brain states of finite size.  So if you never cease to exist 
<br>
as yourself in the next week; and it's either physically or 
<br>
mathematically impossible to continue forever as a pre-Singularity 
<br>
human; and you have more fun if you're allowed to learn things; that 
<br>
would seem to force you down the slippery slope that leads into Great 
<br>
Oldness.
