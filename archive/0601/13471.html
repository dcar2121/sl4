<p>Actually, he's already described how - &quot;coherent sphaleron transitions&quot; - in 
<br>
a paper where he's trying to provide a physical mechanism for Biblical 
<br>
miracles of materialization: <a href="http://home.worldonline.nl/~sttdc/tipler.htm">http://home.worldonline.nl/~sttdc/tipler.htm</a>
<br>
<p>A sphaleron is a sort of four-dimensional soliton (an &quot;instanton&quot;) which can 
<br>
replace quarks with electrons or neutrinos, and vice versa. It involves 
<br>
quantum tunneling between field configurations, across a trillion-volt 
<br>
potential-energy barrier. As this is *extremely* unlikely at terrestrial or 
<br>
even at solar temperatures, he has to postulate that the Higgs field gets 
<br>
into an unusually peaked quantum state, far from thermal equilibrium - this 
<br>
is the requirement of coherence.
<br>
<p>So how are these tuned Higgs states created? He doesn't say, but he says he 
<br>
believes that &quot;the consistency of quantum field theory&quot; requires that they 
<br>
should be technologically accessible. Now, the last time Tipler used 
<br>
&quot;consistency&quot; to deduce something, it was in his Omega Point Theory. He 
<br>
decided that if a black hole were to ever completely evaporate, at any place 
<br>
or time in the cosmos, it would create a naked singularity and thus an 
<br>
&quot;inconsistency&quot;; he further deduced that only intelligent life could stop 
<br>
this from ever happening; and so concluded that life would last forever. 
<br>
That argument has an elementary flaw - anything that technology can do, a 
<br>
random fluctuation can do too; so he might as well have argued merely that 
<br>
consistency-saving quantum fluctuations would occur for the rest of time. 
<br>
The premise that total evaporation leads to inconsistency is flawed in any 
<br>
case; string theorists, at least, think they can describe the process from 
<br>
start to finish.
<br>
<p>My point is that the consistency to which Tipler is appealing may once again 
<br>
be the consistency of his peculiar physical theology, and not of quantum 
<br>
field theory as such - although the point of his apologetics is to argue 
<br>
that the two things are the same, that the latter logically implies the 
<br>
former. More bluntly: his basic reason for believing that sphaleron-powered 
<br>
&quot;materialization technology&quot; is possible under terrestrial conditions, may 
<br>
be nothing more than that the Christian gospels also took place at room 
<br>
temperature.
