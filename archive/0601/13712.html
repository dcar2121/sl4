<p>
fair point.
<br>
to use to your examples, lets fudge an effort at some stats.
<br>
north korea population: 23 million
<br>
south korea population: 48 million
<br>
<p>let's say south korea has a child abuse rate similar to that of
<br>
westernised democracies, ignoring any social/cultural differences and
<br>
possbly discounting certain extra qualitities in our esteemed korean
<br>
firends that may reduce their incidence rate. so keeping the rate at 1
<br>
in 4, i.e. the _low_ rate presented by free western societies with
<br>
civil liberties and non-manufactured societies, there are 12 million
<br>
south koreans who were abused as children.
<br>
<p>with those maths, there will be a good number of children who will
<br>
raped in south korea before I finish this post.
<br>
<p>i'm not delibetately trying to be morbid/depressing here, just trying
<br>
to outline what we as a society are forced to accept and are powerless
<br>
to change. A post-singularity AGI, however, will presumably have this
<br>
power at their disposal, and as much if not more compassion than us
<br>
primitive precursor beings. The suffering of the little children may
<br>
be more than it can bear, and it will be in a position to do something
<br>
about it. The question simply is, what?
<br>
<p>Coming back to my junk math, say north korea, as a state where &quot;rape,
<br>
torture and murder on truly large scales have taken place&quot;, has a
<br>
child abuse rate twice that of the south, i.e. 1 in 2 - pretty
<br>
horrible numbers I would have thought. Still, that shakes out to 11.5
<br>
million north koreans who have been subjected to child rape, as
<br>
opposed to 12 million south koreans; in real terms, the numbers are no
<br>
better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Let us not get so carried away with flights of abstract fancy that we lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; track of reality.
</em><br>
I'm not trying to suggest that an AGI is going to decide that a Kim
<br>
Jong-Il style regime is better than a representative democracy; nor am
<br>
I trying to suggest that the repeal of civil liberties is the silver
<br>
bullet to salve the ills of society, though certain elements in modern
<br>
governace would look to disagree with me; based on the balance of
<br>
legislation for the last few decades.
<br>
<p>But what I am suggesting is that an AGI may find itself unable to
<br>
accept such malignant acts, in their entirety. Not one child, not ever
<br>
again; forget about a million. So what does it do? Raise them itself?
<br>
Add nano/chemical restraints into the air/water supply? Surreptiously
<br>
implant sense-recorders? Decide adults are damaged goods, and keep us
<br>
all pre-pubescent children of the corn?
<br>
<p>Sooner or later we're going to have to accept modifications to our
<br>
ethical code, whether we like it or not. It could be my small
<br>
pre-singularity mind, but all I can see is inroads cut into
<br>
libertarian freedoms, or a superintelligence that could care less
<br>
whether we live or die, are tortured or are free from harm. Any
<br>
attempts by us dogs to dictate behaviour to our future master(s) must
<br>
eventually end up as ineffectual barking; surely we're kidding
<br>
ourselves to think any restraints we attempt to place on its behaviour
<br>
won't eventually be overcome, especially if they don't bear up under
<br>
scrutiny to higher ethical values. i.e. the right to live must surely
<br>
outrank the right to privacy, even if both are universal human rights.
<br>
<p>If we're going to have to face these issues (those of us who don't do
<br>
a puritan repeat and flee civilzation in starships to found
<br>
anarchist/fundamentalist enclaves at the frontier - and thats _if_ we
<br>
or our super-AI have spacefaring tech by then) then we're presambly
<br>
going to have to start thinking about what kind of a deal we're
<br>
prepared to cut that will cement both the freedoms of adults and the
<br>
safety of children; and a hundred other allowances that will eradicate
<br>
the occurence of these - to use a strong word - evils.
<br>
<p>while I'm at it, here's more future-shock for libertarians - what
<br>
happens when the flesh-and-blood of creator of a successfully evolving
<br>
AGI is gunned down as an innocnet bystander during a street shooting?
<br>
do we think that AGI is going to have much truck for the right to bear
<br>
arms?
<br>
<p>are we trying to say that _all_ future instances of AI will be
<br>
simpering, benign, benevolent zero-action pacifists and will remain
<br>
that way? I know some of what I'm saying borders on alarmist, but
<br>
isn't this other end of the spectrum just as naive?
