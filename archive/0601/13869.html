<p><p>Okay; this would seem to be a version of the &quot;immortality through one's

<p>In the patternist veiw , could additive change be different than revisive

<p><p>It might. For example, an entity that was me with added intelligence but
<br>
preserving my core values, would have a better claim on being &quot;still me&quot;

than an entity which differed in those core values.
<br>
<p>And russel would you veiw a static utopia, where you loop continuously

</em><br>
<p><p>I wouldn't view a static utopia as desirable. Whether a continuous loop
<br>
could reasonably be called &quot;static&quot; depends on the length of the loop

(consider for example a loop of length 2^N where N is the number of bits
<br>
describing a particular mind state within some broad category).
