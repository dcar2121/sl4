Daniel &gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I do not believe there is such a thing as a partially
</em><br>
consistent mathematical system. A system is either
<br>
consistent or inconsistent, and if it is inconsistent,
<br>
it doesn't work. 
<br>
<p>*A* particular formal system has to be consistent
<br>
(because in an inconsistent system you can prove
<br>
anything), but my suggestion was that a full
<br>
description of reality may require *several*
<br>
over-lapping formal systems.  Each system *in itself*
<br>
would be consistent, but the different systems would
<br>
not be fully consistent *with each other*.  An analogy
<br>
here would be a 3-D movie.  To get the 3-D effect two
<br>
different versions of a scene are shot - each version
<br>
is shifted slightly in space (one version for each
<br>
eye).  Each version of the scene is consistent in
<br>
itself (left eye version or right eye version), but
<br>
the two versions are not fully consistent with each
<br>
other.  (Consider the two versions to be analogous to
<br>
several formal systems).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What he has said is that there is no a priori reason
</em><br>
to say you are wrong. There is also no reason to say
<br>
you are right. So why should we believe you? 
<br>
<p>Here are my reasons:
<br>
<p>If there's only one unitary mathematics which is fully
<br>
consistent describing reality, then there appears to
<br>
be no way to explain the existence of mathematics
<br>
itself.  The trouble is that in a formal system which
<br>
is fully consistent and complete (and at least complex
<br>
enough to include arithmetic) there are true
<br>
statements that can be phrased in the language of the
<br>
system which cannot be proved true within the system -
<br>
this of course follows from the Godel theorems.  So if
<br>
the formal system running reality was fully consistent
<br>
and complete then one would have no choice to conclude
<br>
that there must exist an endless number of true axioms
<br>
(since for any number finite number of axioms there
<br>
would be some true math statements which escaped the
<br>
net - Godel).  So with a single formal system it's an
<br>
endless tower of turtles all the way down.  But the
<br>
explanation as to *why* this system of mathematics
<br>
existed could never be explained.  It would just have
<br>
to be accepted as a brute fact.
<br>
<p>Now this to me seems to run contrary to the scientific
<br>
method, which by its very nature assumes that there
<br>
are no unexplained supernatural brute facts of
<br>
reality.  And mathematics itself is a part of reality.
<br>
&nbsp;So a full explanation of reality should require
<br>
science to explain mathematics as well.  And as I just
<br>
pointed out, with a single formal system running
<br>
reality, this couldn't be done - there'd be an endless
<br>
tower of turtles all the way down. 
<br>
<p>Now if, however, we adopt my superficially
<br>
'unappealing' suggestion that reality as a whole is
<br>
inconsistent, the situation changes.  There would then
<br>
be several different over-lapping formal systems
<br>
needed to fully describe reality.  *And each formal
<br>
system could be used to provide an explanation of the
<br>
others*  Thus mathematics could 'explain itself' and
<br>
there need be no endless unexplained tower of Godelian
<br>
turtles.  So you see, my suggestion is not so
<br>
unappealing after all.
<br>
