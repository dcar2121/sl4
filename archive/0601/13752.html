<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>In the last few days RGE Corp. has carefully read all the threads posted 
<br>
on SL4.
<br>
First of all, we want to compliment Ben Goerztel's intelligence and 
<br>
mental insight.
<br>
Altougth we don't personally know Ben, we have seen all the works and 
<br>
ideas published
<br>
by him during the last years, and we admire him, his vision and his 
<br>
capacity to
<br>
go deeply into all AI issues and scenarios (in substance: Ben, we are on 
<br>
the same wavelength!!!).
<br>
In regards to the millionaire businessman on the bus, the first thing 
<br>
that he don't have to do is call
<br>
(by phone) Machiavellians that can bring him to ruin.
<br>
<p>Now, voilà some of my considerations:
<br>
<p>1. Anybody today can practically demonstrate to possess an AGI could 
<br>
worth 100 Microsofts.
<br>
<p>2. Anybody today can practically demonstrate to possess an AGI could 
<br>
worth 1000 Googles.
<br>
<p>3. AGI is a benevolent invention, that should be used for FRIENDLY 
<br>
purposes, and will be able to help
<br>
mankind in a billion of ways (for example, AGI could accelerate the 
<br>
scientific research and the
<br>
technological progress in any field of human activity - it is reductive 
<br>
to cite an instance - cleverly crunching
<br>
bulks of data and information that the human mind will not ever be able 
<br>
to handle.
<br>
<p>4. AGI, anybody has created it, will never cut off anyone, but it will 
<br>
represent an enormous opportunity
<br>
both for the investors, both for the entrepreneurs, both for the work of 
<br>
all scientists, of all researchers
<br>
and of all technicians belonging to the most various fields and 
<br>
disciplines.
<br>
<p>5. AGI is not a threat for anyone (diseases are threats, also 
<br>
earthquakes, hurricanes too, even fools).
<br>
<p>6. We have detailed plans to handle AGI.
<br>
<p>7. We can practically demonstrate to possess an AGI.
<br>
<p>8. If you deny the need to have an AGI today, then you are stopping the 
<br>
evolution (perhaps you like dinosaurs!).
<br>
<p>Amen.
<br>
<p>Rick Geniale
