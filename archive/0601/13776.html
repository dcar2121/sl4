<p><em>&gt; The second reply is a variation on the first, but requires more

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in-practice binary distinction between our level and that of &quot;lesser&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Obviously I don't hold up the current human level of those things as
<br>
sacrosanct, since I said that the lion must have rights in a way
<br>
analagous to the way humans do.
<br>
<p>If you don't give lower organisms autonomy, and if you micromanage the
<br>
entire environment, then you are going to end up organizing everything
<br>
towards your ends.  It would make no sense to preserve any lower
<br>
species at all.  Whatever they were naturally, you could redesign them
<br>
in a way that would be more directed towards your goals.  None of this
<br>
&quot;we're going to keep lions in a simulation!&quot; crap.  Either lower
<br>
organisms have some autonomy, some rights to resources, or we vaporize
<br>
them and turn Earth into a Jupiter brain, and There Can Be Only One.
