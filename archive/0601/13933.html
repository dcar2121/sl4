<p>Different projects do things differently.  This group is doing it the way it 
<br>
chooses to.  I'm sure there are/will be others.  One of them will succeed.  
<br>
We just need to hope that it's one that doesn't create a monster.  It's 
<br>
always been the rule that the project leaders set the criteria that they use 
<br>
for acceptance.  It's true for Kernel Hackers, it's true for Python 
<br>
developers, etc.  And it's true here.  I'm not currently aware of a good open 
<br>
source project.  And this one demands that it be taken on faith.  (Well, I 
<br>
don't trust languages that heavily demand pointers...so I didn't check any 
<br>
further than that.  This lets me out of most projects, except the ones that 
<br>
use Java, which I also don't like.  Sigh.  And it's difficult to do anything 
<br>
dynamic in Ada [not impossible, but difficult], and the pool of possible 
<br>
programmers is too small for such a project to be viable.  That leaves 
<br>
Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, ...   Of the languages that I've 
<br>
examined, I prefer Ruby.  Unfortunately, it's also the slowest at 
<br>
execution...so I keep bouncing around.  A project would stabilize me, but I'm 
<br>
unwilling to devote myself to pointers [i.e. C, C++] to achieve that.  And I 
<br>
fear Mono/C#.  It's just too likely that MS has some hidden gotcha! that will 
<br>
surface just as it becomes important.)
