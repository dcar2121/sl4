<em>&gt; Modality level: reading, speed reading (how effective is this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anybody?), 
</em><br>
<p>Extremely -- 2500 WPM is easily reproducible, while
<br>
some claim 25,000+ but I haven't personally achieved
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>The key to speed reading is it is almost precisely
<br>
like &quot;weight lifting&quot; -- you have to work it and it
<br>
works in proportion to the effort and exercise you
<br>
put into it. 
<br>
<p>foreign languages, 
<br>
<p>New methods for learning languages are speeding
<br>
up this process (verses the mid 20th Century even.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and also various sports, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; martial arts, and &quot;twitch&quot; video games.
</em><br>
<p>My suggestions would be the arts with significant
<br>
'soft' components, e.g., Aikido, Tai Chi, Pentjak
<br>
Silat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Concept level: I think that most people do not often generate new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts except as children. Concepts can be serialized into text or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech, and then re-encoded by another human, but the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfer is lossy.
</em><br>
<p>There are algorithms for producing &quot;creativity&quot;
<br>
and other skills that many people believe are
<br>
fixed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Because of this, it is usually not possible to teach someone a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept unless you can express it concisely in terms of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler concepts that they already know. 
</em><br>
<p>Or teach them the simpler concept they need first.
<br>
<p>An interesting source for mathematics is 
<br>
&quot;The Road to Reality : A Complete Guide to the Laws 
<br>
of the Universe&quot; by Roger Penrose; he does a fair
<br>
job of guiding the reader through the math needed
<br>
for modeling the laws of physics.
<br>
<p>This is neither graduate level mathematics text
<br>
NOR a layman's popularization, but the closest
<br>
thing to a blend of the two that I have so far
<br>
found. (I have a serious &quot;web link list&quot; for 
<br>
supplementing this book if anyone is serious about
<br>
reading it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A person who is experienced at generating new concepts should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;repair&quot; concepts that have been mangled by the process of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serialization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and re-encoding, 
</em><br>
<p>Troubleshooting (e.g., of computer systems, logistics
<br>
systems, and mechanical systems, etc) is a teachable
<br>
skill as well -- the trick is to teach people to 
<br>
realize that those same techniques can be used and
<br>
further adapted to enhance one's own mental etc.
<br>
capabilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and so should be able to learn concepts faster with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fewer supporting concepts. Most training available today (in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialized subject) seems to focus on conveying a large number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts.
</em><br>
<p>Or isolating the key, critical components and teaching
<br>
those as a basis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is out there that can help you practice generating new concepts?
</em><br>
<p>Modeling those with such skills is (at least one of) 
<br>
the most effective meta-skills for doing such things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, there are induction games like Zendo and and Eleusis, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (depending on who you are playing with) can lead to many new concepts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but these new concepts are usually discarded after the game 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ends. It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been suggested to me that the process of learning games like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Go involves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generating concepts, but this seems very slow to me. Writing science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction seems like it fits here too.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thought and deliberation levels: &quot;Critical thinking,&quot; the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method, mathematical logic, and probability theory all go here, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do things like meditation. These are different approaches to thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be learned, but seem to be very sensitive to natural ability.
</em><br>
<p>Natural ability is vastly overrated.
<br>
<p>For most people who just blunder through it is
<br>
pretty much the whole game, but most any skill
<br>
is (radically) more teachable than people 
<br>
generally realize.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; High schools and universities attempt (or claim to attempt) to teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;critical thinking,&quot; but are they teaching anything, or only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeding out those who don't do it already?
</em><br>
<p>Practically no pre-colleges do this; and from
<br>
what I know there are few colleges and universities
<br>
that do it aggressively enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Heuristics and biases belong at the thought level. Learning about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heuristics and biases can help you spot systematic errors, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hopefully) learn to stop making them.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and to exploit them when that is effective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Something fun you could try is to sit down with a calculator 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Google,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and optionally a friend, and play Bayescraft: think of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question with N
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible answers, assign a probability to each, and check the answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Multiply your cumulative score by the probability you assigned to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct answer. Alternatively, one player can write down a sequence in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; binary, and the other players can predict the next value.
</em><br>
<p>What's the purpose of this?  (Not being critical, but
<br>
merely sincerely curious...)
