The slippery slope actually goes the other way but adding a Rights Charter admitting all individual persons and animals prevents Charter members from being turned into Jupiter Brains.  The lion post-singularity has a right not to be murdered/tortured and a right to immunization and whatever else can be easily administered.  Neither people nor lions should have the right to kill.  They can both hunt realistic robots instead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Micromanaging lower organisms is to serve their ends, not ours.  The problem is you are assuming a species population has some value apart from the individual
<br>
animals that compose it.  This is not true.  Ecosystems have no value save for pleasure and pain that its members experience.  Trade in your reverance of evolution for reverence of individual qualities-of-life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously I don't hold up the current human level of those things as
<br>
sacrosanct, since I said that the lion must have rights in a way
<br>
analagous to the way humans do.
<br>
<p>If you don't give lower organisms autonomy, and if you micromanage the
<br>
entire environment, then you are going to end up organizing everything
<br>
towards your ends. It would make no sense to preserve any lower
<br>
species at all. Whatever they were naturally, you could redesign them
<br>
in a way that would be more directed towards your goals. None of this
<br>
&quot;we're going to keep lions in a simulation!&quot; crap. Either lower
<br>
organisms have some autonomy, some rights to resources, or we vaporize
<br>
them and turn Earth into a Jupiter brain, and There Can Be Only One.
