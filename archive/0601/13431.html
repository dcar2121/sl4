<p>No cigar. Go back and reread Richard's early post on this topic, where he 
<br>
described his shock at obtaining a significant deviation from chance in an 
<br>
experiment where the single degree of freedom was the choice of a seed 
<br>
number for a pseudorandom number generator run.
<br>
<p>This was not the first or only time anybody had thought of doing this, and 
<br>
got positive results. In fact, using pseudorandom number generators is (or 
<br>
at least used to be) quite typical in experimental parapsychology.
<br>
<p>On quasi-theoretical grounds derived informally from many worlds QT, I have 
<br>
published the suggestion that genuinely stochastic events ought, in 
<br>
principle, to be more difficult to precognize than deterministic (but 
<br>
masked, double-blind) targets. That's precisely because events such as the 
<br>
next solar eclipse are highly accurately predictable by ordinary means, 
<br>
assuming one has the knowledge and the algorithm in hand, whereas knowing 
<br>
where and when the next killer earthquake will occur is far less 
<br>
scientifically predictable, for chaotic reasons. If the winning numbers in 
<br>
most lotteries are not fixed in advance, they might be more difficult to 
<br>
predict by psi, if I'm right, than those in lotteries or casinos that are 
<br>
crooked (assuming there are any, heaven forbid). But so far, I have not 
<br>
seen enough evidence to support either view.
<br>
<p>This has been a wildly emotional religious rant.
