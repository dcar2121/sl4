<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes silicon is versatile.  Not as much as carbon, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably #2 if you are building stuff.
</em><br>
<p>I am not interested in silicon’s ability to form compounds, I am only
<br>
interested in its electrical properties. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; tracing the specific engineering roots of why we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet use carbon-based semiconductors.
</em><br>
<p>I’m sure in a few years we will be using carbon-based semiconductors, it
<br>
should work great, we don’t use it right now because crystallized
<br>
silicon is cheap and crystallized carbon
<br>
(also know as diamond) is a tad less cheap.     
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you've defined in the past that anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either is random or is not.
</em><br>
<p>What I said is everything happens because of cause and effect or it does
<br>
not and thus is random. Nothing wrong with randomness, I know of no law
<br>
of logic that demands every event have a cause.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;True Randomness is unpredictability, unintelligibility. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and that is why it has nothing to do with “free will”, whatever
<br>
that means.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; People are using these rules to construct a class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of computers called Quantum Computers that aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the least bit random. 
</em><br>
<p>Not true, a properly programmed quantum computer can produce a true
<br>
random output, something a Turing Machine can not do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here we can use Anthropic reasoning to conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entire universe is not truly random.
</em><br>
<p>I didn’t say nothing had a cause, I only said everything didn’t have a
<br>
cause.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes neurotransmitter molecules exhibit properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a molecular computer.
</em><br>
<p>No, they are not nearly that sophisticated. Neurotransmitter molecules
<br>
are more like a very low bandwidth ridiculously slow wire that has
<br>
serious crosstalk problems. And this kludge is the key to our humanity?
<br>
I don’t think so.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In our neurons there is a specific system orientation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that has to be maintained for emotions to emerge.
</em><br>
<p>You are simply stating that brains can only be made of meat but you
<br>
don’t give one reason why this must be the case.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can't have computation without a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical computer substrate.
</em><br>
<p>I think so, but you say people are not computers yet we know they can
<br>
perform computation, so one of your statements must be wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But your computer software only affects physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes within your computer.  
</em><br>
<p>I don’t know what you’re talking about, if you can’t get answers out of
<br>
a computer it’s useless. My computer effects my CRT screen and my
<br>
printer, and those things effect yet another physical system, me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you add robotics or nanotech or any sort of engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to your computer, now you are affecting physical fields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and particles and other mind-building tools.  If you ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this type of computer to figure out a blueprint and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build it...  viola, the computer can then kill us off or whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Shit happens. One way or another the human race as we know it will
<br>
become extinct sometime during this century, probably in the first half.
