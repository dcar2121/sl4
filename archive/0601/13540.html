Phillip,
<br>
<p>The core of what you are saying is the old chestnut about whether you 
<br>
can have a human-level-intelligence thinking being *without* it being 
<br>
conscious.
<br>
<p>You talk as if it were possible to have mind with or without consciousness.
<br>
<p>You are also pointing to the &quot;it must have the right substrate to be 
<br>
conscious&quot; position.  Again, one of the standard moves in this oft 
<br>
rehearsed philosophical chess game.
<br>
<p>At the very least, it is not even slightly obvious why substrate type 
<br>
should have any bearing on consciousness.  And many people disagree that 
<br>
it does:  I do, and I think Mikko does for the same reason (he points 
<br>
out that hormone systems are just another message passing system).
<br>
<p>I think that consciousness is not going to be separable in the way you 
<br>
believe.  Many others take this position.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are EM fields that can be detected originating within

</em><br>
<em>&gt; things like an EEG are the best markers we have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as I know you can't reproduce EM fields on conventional computer

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a kid who made a Scanning Tunneling Microscope out of lego, but the
