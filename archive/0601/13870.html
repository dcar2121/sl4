<em>&gt;&gt; Another variety of thread veiw.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Is that the thread of consciousness, continues through all future  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that you have power over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This is basicall;, you are (or you should have moral obligation to) all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the future entitys that you have power over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So when copy of you is uploaded  since you determined how it would be  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; had power over it. An it is you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay; this would seem to be a version of the &quot;immortality through one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works&quot; view.
</em><br>
<p>It could be seen as that, since our most important works are ourselves.
<br>
<p>A better way of explaing it is; suppose we discard the idea of a broad  
<br>
self. Then we have a phase-space of entitys lasting for mere instants  
<br>
(possibly longer if it is static).
<br>
Then the real question becomes; why should one entity be loyal towards any  
<br>
particular future entity?
<br>
<p>Pragmaticism, the entitys which it has power over, are those through which  
<br>
it can acheive it's goals(this is where I stretch it a bit).
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the patternist veiw , could additive change be different than revisive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; change, if you became a god by merely adding to your existing self -  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would it be you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might. For example, an entity that was me with added intelligence but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving my core values, would have a better claim on being &quot;still me&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than an entity which differed in those core values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And russel would you veiw a static utopia, where you loop continuously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; desirable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wouldn't view a static utopia as desirable. Whether a continuous loop
</em><br>
<p>Well I could use the word perfect or eternal utopia instead, if a pattern  
<br>
is you, and surviving is good, then it follows that preserving the pattern  
<br>
is desirable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; could reasonably be called &quot;static&quot; depends on the length of the loop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (consider for example a loop of length 2^N where N is the number of bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describing a particular mind state within some broad category).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Russell
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand the maths, do you mean; the loop is larger than just  
<br>
the mind, or that it grows as the mind grows.
