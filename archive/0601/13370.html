</em><br>
<p>Just to clarify, this rule actually says that if you know that A implies B
<br>
then you *can and must* deduce that not-B implies not-A.
<br>
<p>For example, the statement &quot;If it is raining the sidewalk gets wet.&quot; implies
<br>
that &quot;If the sidewalk is dry it must not be raining.&quot;, because, if it were
<br>
raining, the sidewalk would have been wet instead.
<br>
<p>For the same reason, if the statment &quot;If psi phenomena are real then a psychic
<br>
would be able to win a lottery&quot; is true, then &quot;If no psychic can win a
<br>
lottery, then psi phenomena are not real&quot; has to be true.
<br>
<p>I haven't heard of any psychic (or group of psychics working togeather)
<br>
winning a lottery, and they have more than enough motivation to do so.
<br>
Further, I'm prerry sure that if psi were real, people would be able to
<br>
predict lotteries.  If not, why the arbitrary restrictions?  They make
<br>
matters more complicated than they need to be!  By Occam's Razor, I must
<br>
weight the hypothesis of psi-with-special-lottery-exemption, or for that
<br>
matter psi-with-a-whole-set-of-related-exceptions-including-lotteries as much
<br>
less probable than I rate the hypothesis of psi itself.
<br>
<p>Therefore, the fact that psychics win lotteries no more frequently than
<br>
anybody else is indeed very strong evidence against psi phenomena being real.
