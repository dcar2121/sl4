<em>&gt; &gt;About 10 times more per unit of time that I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;before learning the skill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;2500 WPM with similar comprehension is attainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;through moderate but serious practice.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Somehow reading at speeds like this gives the impression to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me of simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blindly integrating a lot of base level data. That just isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough though.
</em><br>
<p>Remember we are talking about SIMILAR or BETTER
<br>
comprehension.
<br>
<p>There are two or three standard 'objections' to
<br>
speed reading, this is one of the classics (not
<br>
a criticism of your impression, just to let you
<br>
know it is highly typical.)
<br>
<p>Sometimes the objection is expressed along the 
<br>
lines of &quot;what about reading for relaxation?&quot; or
<br>
&quot;what about poetry?&quot; or (your next example) &quot;what
<br>
about math?&quot;...
<br>
<p>Here's the key:  Once you can speed read you never
<br>
lose the ability to read SLOWLY.  It is precisely
<br>
analogous to learning to run, or ride a bicycle
<br>
or even fly an airplane:  No one would seriously
<br>
try to walk from America to Europe for a business
<br>
meeting next Tuesday-- you fly.
<br>
<p>But no one would fly to the corner market to pick
<br>
up milk and bread.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Imagine attempting to read a math textbook, over a section 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have no previous knowledge about, at 2500 WPM.
</em><br>
<p>Most of the time, I read math slowly -- math is typically
<br>
very dense information (in most cases.)
<br>
<p>BUT, I can alter this in several ways:  I can read ahead
<br>
at a rapid pace -- perhaps the item that is troubling
<br>
me will be explained better by a later example.
<br>
<p>I can read it rapidly once, then slowly, then study
<br>
over the parts that still trouble me.
<br>
<p>Or, I can just read it the way that &quot;everyone else 
<br>
does&quot; -- like I used to read it always.
<br>
<p>Oddly enough, some math and EVEN some poetry works
<br>
better at high speeds.  My best example of this for
<br>
poetry that is largely visual imagery.  Much of the
<br>
feel for speed reading is closer to video or images
<br>
than to that usual &quot;voice in your head.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It just doesn't make sense to me. You aren't really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehending in a &quot;more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal&quot; way, because integrating base level data just isn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearly as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important as appying more complex constructions of this base 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level data. 
</em><br>
<p>No, it just doesn't make sense to you because you haven't
<br>
done it - just as if you try to explain vision to someone
<br>
who is blind from birth....
<br>
<p>Or trying to explain WHAT READING is to someone who is
<br>
not only illiterate but who has grown up in an primitive
<br>
culture where there is no lifelong explanation of the
<br>
value of reading....
<br>
<p>How can text on the page allow you to learn as if you
<br>
were listening to an instructor or as if you were 
<br>
watching a play, or....
<br>
<p>For those who have never read this makes no sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be better off spending your time going slowly and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; updating/adding/subtracting hypotheses on all the levels of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstraction for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every piece of information you are getting.
</em><br>
<p>Now you are telling me &quot;you would be better off...&quot;
<br>
<p>No, I have more choices (than I had before) and I
<br>
am free to choose the best method, or methods, for
<br>
my needs, time, and even adjust based on results...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does that makes sense?
</em><br>
<p>It makes sense that you have those feelings; it
<br>
does not correspond to the reality of the skill.
