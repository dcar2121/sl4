In keeping with my earlier post, I should say that the basic assumption 
<br>
behind your calculation is wildly pessimistic, in my estimation.
<br>
<p>AGI research could easily hit a sudden patch of rapid advance.  I know 
<br>
we have to be cautious when citing history, but you have to remember 
<br>
that there are untild numbers of examples of technological dreams that 
<br>
were proceeeding slowly and were not expected in anyone's lifetime, then 
<br>
suddenly arrived out of nowhere:
<br>
<p>[You probably all know these five stories, but it is fun to remind 
<br>
ourselves of them from time to time :-)]:
<br>
<p>1) The Wright brothers were extremely depressed about their rate of 
<br>
progress a mere 6 months before they took off.  At times they thought it 
<br>
would never work.
<br>
<p>2) The early railway builders got delirious about their progress, but 
<br>
when some of them began telling investors that trains would one day be 
<br>
able to travel faster than 20 mph, the mature, experienced engineers 
<br>
decided that enough was enough, and they came out in public and 
<br>
denounced the hotheads - this was the origin of the &quot;something bad would 
<br>
happen if people ever travelled faster than 20 mph&quot; story.
<br>
<p>3) In 1913 the radio pioneer Lee DeForest was successfully prosecuted 
<br>
for fraud, thus: &quot;DeForest has said in many newspapers and over his 
<br>
signature that it would be possible to transmit the human voice across 
<br>
the Atlantic before many years.  Based on these absurd and deliberately 
<br>
misleading statements, the misguided public … has been persuaded to 
<br>
purchase stock in his company.&quot;
<br>
<p>4) And then, in 1926, the same Lee DeForest, said, &quot;While theoretically 
<br>
and technically television may be feasible, commercially and 
<br>
financially, I consider it an impossibility, a development of which we 
<br>
need waste little time dreaming.&quot;  Even he could not see what was abouty 
<br>
to happen.
<br>
<p>5) In the early 1950s, the great futurist Arthur C. Clarke was a wild 
<br>
optimist when it came to space travel, but even he didn't really think 
<br>
anyone would get to the moon before the end of the century.
<br>
<p>Now, what these examples should *not* teach us is that we can just dream 
<br>
up a loony idea about the future and then tell everyone that it is just 
<br>
around the corner, citing the previous surprises as &quot;proof.&quot;  But on the 
<br>
other hand, it takes a lot of insight for us to understand exactly what 
<br>
happened in the minds of the people who made those failed predictions: 
<br>
they were smart cookies, all of them, and they knew that people had 
<br>
previously failed to see big things coming, but they *thought* they were 
<br>
not subject to the [sic] narrowmindedness and lack of vision that those 
<br>
other folks must have suffered from, so they felt they were being sensible.
<br>
<p>Bottom line:  it could take one year.
<br>
<p>Probably won't, but it could.
<br>
<p>At any rate, it would be foolish to sell the AGI idea with a timeline of 
<br>
30-40 years attached to it.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; available capital (he is smart with money so doesn't bet the farm), that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests an investor with $10M of capital. If this is 75% of his total 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net worth (the rest in real estate, stock options, etc.), that means we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a 45 year old worth $13.3M. How many 45 year olds are worth $13.3M? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would an interesting figure to see especially at the global scale. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I ! believe the last Merrill Lynch world wealth report suggested there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were about 70,000 people with a net worth of $30M or more in the world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an age-blind figure. The same document said there were 7.6 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million people worth $1M or more. So, $13.3M would fall somewhere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between that. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bottom-line is that we might be talking about an uncommon beast, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this younger than 45 year-old worth $13.3.M. My bet would be that a 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; other entertainment types. This is just a guess.
