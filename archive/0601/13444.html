Eliezer, Michael,
<br>
<p>Oh, quit your pessimism! :-)
<br>
<p>It is entirely possible for psi to exist and for all of physics to be 
<br>
the same as it is now, plus some extras.  What on earth makes you think 
<br>
this is impossible?   Physicists themselves are, I think, a good deal 
<br>
less upset by the idea of psi than you are, so you why are you getting 
<br>
so upset and gloomy on their behalf?
<br>
<p>[Quick example of one exotic way to integrate physics and psi.  It turns 
<br>
out that the laws of the universe are almost all local, but in addition 
<br>
there is at least one weak effect that is not local at all, and that is 
<br>
that &quot;representational&quot; entities like human minds tend to get into sync 
<br>
with the things in the world they are representing.  So if someone 
<br>
imagines a tomorrow in which they have a greater than average score on a 
<br>
psi test, there is some tendency for the imagined tomorrow and the real 
<br>
tomorrow.  So the test result comes out the way the subject wants, more 
<br>
often than it should.  Notice that theoretical physicists *do* *not* 
<br>
rule out the existence of non-local effects in the universe (there is no 
<br>
law that says they must not occur), they just say that so far they have 
<br>
not needed them.  Such non-local things (where one entity that is not 
<br>
located at a single point in space influences some other part of the 
<br>
universe) could easily exist so long as the effects were not gross: 
<br>
there is enough wiggle room in current theories of physics to allow for 
<br>
quantum events to almost always obey regular quantum mechanics, but with 
<br>
the probabilities being slightly skewed.  And if this seems like crazy 
<br>
talk, go listen to some theoretical physicists discuss the latest ideas 
<br>
about time travel, where some of them have come up with the notion that 
<br>
maybe full-up, no-nonsense time travel is possible, but the universe 
<br>
simply adjusts itself to accommodate and deflect any events that would 
<br>
cause a time paradox!].
<br>
<p>And on a more general point:  I wish people wouldn't keep talking as if 
<br>
the lack of a theoretical underpinning means anything whatsoever for the 
<br>
validity of experimental data.  You do that, you throw science to the dogs.
<br>

<em>&gt; If psi is *not* part of the world, as I believe, then it may not be 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; apples did not stop falling when Einstein's *theory* overthrew Newton's 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; psi such that not everything else we knew would be wrong - apples would 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; invalidate everything that you think it is not real.  This is, in cold 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sober fact, circular logic, or more kindly a consistent worldview, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is the possibility of both arcs of the loop being invalidated 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; From my perspective, from decision theory for humans purposes, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entire huge space of universe states describable as &quot;everything I know 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is wrong&quot; simply renormalizes out of my decision function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It's not worth our talking about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Everything you know is wrong&quot; has been true through quite a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human history, at least in the sense of being able to encompass things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as shocking as magic - such as the total absence of magic.  In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, most people still haven't come to terms with the total absence of 
</em><br>
