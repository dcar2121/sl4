<p>
My take on your question is slightly different than Ben's because I have 
<br>
different approach to the problem.
<br>
<p>My answer to &quot;Why should I invest in AGI?&quot;:
<br>
<p>Because there is the potential for it to take off at a speed that would 
<br>
supply the investor with her own personal starship within a decade or two.
<br>
<p>Here is how.
<br>
<p>If the standard approach to AI turns out to have a Blind Spot Assumption 
<br>
built into it  -  an assumption that is glaringly obvious when you know 
<br>
it is there, but which otherwise is impossible to see  -  and if that 
<br>
BSA turns out to a crucial blockage that has stopped progress all this 
<br>
time, then we could open up the floodgates by dumping that assumption.
<br>
<p>At the risk of sounding like a wild optimist, I actually do believe that 
<br>
we are in this situation.
<br>
<p>We could build a learning system that acquires concepts through 
<br>
experience, and which also has the kind of motivation/emotion system 
<br>
that would make it completely (and reliably) benign, we could find 
<br>
ourselves surprised at how fast it could acquire knowledge and grow up 
<br>
into a superintelligent AGI.
<br>
<p>This is the core of my approach, and I think it will work.  It is so 
<br>
radically different to the standard methods that, at the very least, it 
<br>
might not have the same drawbacks.
<br>
<p>[More soon:  I am trying to corral my ideas into a website.]
