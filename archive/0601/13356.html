<p>
Justin,
<br>
<p>Just a quick note.
<br>
<p>I appreciate your frustration with the lack of depth and substance in 
<br>
that discussion.
<br>
<p>I would be happy to try to give you the information you hoped to see, 
<br>
but I will have to come back to it when I have enough time.  It *does* 
<br>
require a lot of writing to explain to someone who has little 
<br>
background, and there are limits to how much energy I have!
<br>
<p>In my own defence, I would say that I am always willing to invest the 
<br>
effort to write long, detailed replies when the people discussing the 
<br>
matter seem serious about the subject.  But would you do that if the 
<br>
only people responding to you were foaming at the mouth?
<br>
<p>You ask about the relevance of psi for AGI.  Originally, I was trying to 
<br>
shed some light on specific claims made in that debate:  but now that 
<br>
you ask your specific question, I actually think that psi is orthogonal 
<br>
to questions of consciousness and free will, so we will probably be able 
<br>
to create thinking systems that are completely conscious without having 
<br>
to worry about psi.  I suspect (and this will be a fascinating research 
<br>
question when the time comes) that an AGI would cause the same kind of 
<br>
psi effects that humans do.
<br>
<p>In my book, discussion of free will and parapsychology are equally 
<br>
relevant:  neither of them particularly important, but neither should be 
<br>
ruled out of court either.  They do both concern the mind.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well I appreciate the effort, to elevate the discussion, certainly,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely opaque to me, was what the actual fact or process being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposedly argued was supossed to be?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In my eyes the whole discussion was a rather over-ambitious and hence
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; view. Arguing for a whole category is strange and certainly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Again, this is unfair.  I mentioned the serious research that exists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and that I had done some of it.  I and the other serious researchers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;were then insulted as &quot;witch doctors&quot;, a non-scientific fools,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;third-rate scientists&quot;, etc.  The careful and thoughtful replies I gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;at the beginning (when I was ignoring the abuse) were then met with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;words like:   &lt;snip list/&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You described this as a &quot;poor reception&quot;.  I don't think so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well John K Clark is a blunt fellow certainly, personally I've always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciated the agressive intellectually macho tone around here, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can get in the way. My impression again was that the &quot;discussion&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consisted of tennis-ball assertions, and the fact that you were much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more &quot;polite&quot; and injured isn't relevant unless it bears on the facts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the argument,,i.e. &quot;you are wrong because you suck&quot; is ad hominem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and poor arguing, whereas &quot;you are wrong because X, and you suck&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely being rude, and not actually covered by list rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm willing to bite here, although I'm confident about the question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psi, but I'm interested in why a self-described scientist like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself,who seems measured and intelligent, (if a little huffy) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend so much energy defending such matters in this context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The subject came up in the context of consciousness and free will.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is a valid question to ask whether parapsychology has relevance to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;contruction of AGI systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well this would be where you may, if you wish, make this a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific discussion. Are you proposing any factor, which falls under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rubric of &quot;psi&quot; and is thus scientifically unrecognized, which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications for an AI researcher like myself? And that being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, is there a way we can determine if this is so?
</em><br>
