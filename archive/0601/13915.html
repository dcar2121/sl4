</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty bad existential risk.
</em><br>
<p>look to be terse I think this issue is overblown; it's right up there
<br>
with grey goo. I don't know how many programming hours we are away
<br>
from being able to make something unfriendly, when the current state
<br>
of the field seems barely into it's infancy in terms of concious-being
<br>
creation. we currently can't create something which feels a damn
<br>
thing, so until we do, why the hell do we waste so many thought ticks
<br>
agonizing about whether we think it will one day pick us for the ball
<br>
team?. Scaremongers are present in GM, stem cells, nano and elsewhere,
<br>
and I'm sure we think they're plenty misguided. going OT, and sorry to
<br>
flame, but some of you old coots need to remove the stick from your
<br>
arse. You're supposed to be the shock level junkies, right? And these
<br>
problems are so far away in LoC terms as to be pointless to consider.
<br>
Stop being chickenshits already! maybe confine your fears to
<br>
philosophy/morals/ethics posts and give the engineering lights a
<br>
chance to breathe. could it be that the most formidable obstacle to
<br>
_friendly_ AGI development is scaredy-cat filibustering?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; It seems intuitive that encouraging people _not_ to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; program in the AGI sphere would be counterproductive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unless encouraging people who are on the low end of &quot;genius&quot; means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing the odds that the first successful AGI will be less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly than it would have been, had the standards of AGI project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recruiters been less compromising.
</em><br>
<p>sorry to be blunt, but this is more panty-pissing; just get a working
<br>
AGI already. We had nukes before we had non-proliferation treaties;
<br>
and yet no nuclear winter. we had hiv for feck knows how many years
<br>
before we had any kind of treatment, and yet it's a non-fatal disease
<br>
in the west now. It could be fair to say that a crucial component in
<br>
combatting any future malignant AI would be to have a wide range of
<br>
AGI implementations and instances with which to develop a 'friendly'
<br>
pool. And again, feeble attempts at code-on-chip =/= vengeful ai
<br>
overlord; let the mugs have a go - they just might surprise you.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Speed and safety are competing factors in this. Do you try to start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity as quickly as possible, or wait until you're really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure you can do it right, with as much margin for error as possible? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the impression that the seed developer qualifications page is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just firmly on the side of safety, but designed to make sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people motivated by speed who read it will be personally dissuaded.
</em><br>
<p>the developer qualifications page is a good laugh with some serious
<br>
underpinnings. The depth and breadth of the literature involved is
<br>
enormous; thanks go to many on this list and others in the field who
<br>
are doing the heavy lifting of thrashing out these issues and
<br>
expanding our grasp on the subject matter.
<br>
<p>(obligatory &quot;but&quot;) - but - programmers need not be scientists or
<br>
geniuses to produce good code; they need to be good coders. they don't
<br>
really even need to be all that informed on the subject matter. I can
<br>
happily make an SSL connection without knowing a damn thing about the
<br>
tcp/ip stack, block ciphers or the discrete logarithm problem. Yet do
<br>
I get point-to-point encryption anyway? you bet.
<br>
<p>The no doubt incredibly smart people on this list I'm sure would love
<br>
to have legions of these wishlist programmers they posit at their
<br>
disposal; you and every other VC or idea-hamster with a half-baked
<br>
idea. It's important to remember that the majority of the people I
<br>
talk to about this subject think I'm half-mad or on crack, and most of
<br>
them are in tech for chrissakes, as good an audience as you're going
<br>
to get. everyone who has emotional investment in the end-point of AGI
<br>
not being a failed dream should maybe think about that when turning
<br>
away the few of us nutty enough to think you might be on to something
<br>
with this kooky AI business
<br>
<p>For you personally Ben please don't take any of my straight-talking as
<br>
any kind of personal attack; I'm sure you want to meet humanity's
<br>
future AGI love-child(ren) just as much as I do.
<br>
<p>My position is one of genuine, general frustration that no real
<br>
resource avenues of worth seem to exist for programmers who want to
<br>
contribute. Syllabus and recruitment cutoffs have their place, but so
<br>
too does an open invitation to expand the development community in any
<br>
way possible for the good of the field.
<br>
<p>The major                                                             
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue seems
<br>
to be one of 'they might create a monster!' which just doesn't wash
<br>
with me, if only in the fact that we somehow think that having read a
<br>
cognitive deficit text is going to stop an all-star programmer from
<br>
making just as hairy a boogeyman. It does have a touch of
<br>
superstitious old women about it, surely? read this tarot card, so
<br>
thoust may be safe from ee-vil!! I'll say it again; for every line of
<br>
code you actually get running you are one step closer to
<br>
something(anything!) than you are without it, no matter how crap the
<br>
code(r) actually is. I also don't think trying to hard-code any kind
<br>
of restraint into a sentient super-intelligence is going to last any
<br>
longer than a louisiana levee; free the code, dammit! stallman would
<br>
be appalled :-)
