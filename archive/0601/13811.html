<p>
Game theory (if that's what it's called) - to understand the difference
<br>
between the &quot;zero-sum&quot; game of most traditional models, and &quot;infinite
<br>
resource&quot;  (for lack of a better term opposite zero-sum) thinking that will
<br>
result from a post-Singularity economy.
<br>
<p>I would recommend &quot;the Art of War&quot; (Sun Tzu) as it applies to game theory.
<br>
Most of the war game strategies could be applied to building complex
<br>
behavior from simple(r) atomic concepts.  It might be a while before an AGI
<br>
is directly consuming the high-level significance of the text, but if
<br>
developers are writing probability competition algorithms - then &quot;the Art of
<br>
War&quot; is a terse distillation of basic principles.
<br>
<p>How about a course in group dynamics? (or sociology, or whatever your
<br>
university calls it)  If the AI is modelled as a synergistic collection of
<br>
individual cells, each with primitive motivating forces - then the macro
<br>
level behaviors are influenced by micro-level relationships.  Worth
<br>
examining are the edge cases of &quot;mob&quot; psychology, where a group of
<br>
individually good-natured people are swayed by peer-pressure to riot and
<br>
destroy the venue they're inhabiting.
<br>
<p>I know there are those who would approach AGI from a computer science
<br>
direction, but I believe that a multi-discipline background helps bring a
<br>
wide range of new ideas to the table.
<br>
<p>I don't think you would be talking to yourself - in fact, i think this is a
<br>
very worthwhile thread.  I will continue thinking about it, so I can
<br>
contribute more later.
