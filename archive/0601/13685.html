*Intelligence:
<br>
<p>&quot;In the most general sense of the term, intelligence
<br>
is actually the ability to form accurate causal models
<br>
of reality. So this is my definition. Intelligence is
<br>
the ability to accurately model cause and effect
<br>
relations. 
<br>
<p>This definition is more general than just prediction.
<br>
That's because 'causality' doesn't just mean
<br>
functional (or physical) cause and effect. There are
<br>
several different levels of cause and effect that need
<br>
to be modelled for full intelligence. Aside from
<br>
physical causality, there is also volitional (or
<br>
intentional) causality and also mathematical (or
<br>
logical) causality.
<br>
<p>Based on this, here's my attempt a slighly more
<br>
expanded definition of intelligence:
<br>
<p>Intelligence is the ability to form accurate causal
<br>
models of reality. This is the ability to make
<br>
accurate predictions about functional systems, the
<br>
ability to accurately model how volitional agents can
<br>
most effectively achieve goals and finally, the
<br>
ability to integrate different kinds of knowledge into
<br>
a single explanatory framework. To sum up,
<br>
intelligence is:
<br>
<p>The ability to make accurate predictions
<br>
The ability to achieve goals with optimal efficiency
<br>
The ability to integrate knowledge&quot;
<br>
<p><p>*Consciousness:
<br>
<p>&quot;Qualia (conscious experiences) are both the
<br>
underlying substance of reality itself and 'Events' on
<br>
the Mathematical time-line - or processes in
<br>
multi-dimensional time. Qualia (conscious experience)
<br>
are built-up out of all of the processes which make up
<br>
an integrated mind.&quot; 
<br>
<p>'Events' on the mathematical time-line (or Qualia) are
<br>
causal relationships between combinations of Functions
<br>
(models of physical systems) and Memes (models of
<br>
sentient behavior). Such 'Events' are equivalent to
<br>
the fabric of reality itself (Mathematico-Cognition),
<br>
a hybrid of Physical, Volitional and Mathematical
<br>
properties. 
<br>
<p>Therefore mathematical 'Events' are processes in
<br>
multi-dimensional time. The interaction of platonic
<br>
mathematical objects (functions, memes and sets)
<br>
manifests itself as physical, volitional and
<br>
mathematical properties and conscious experience
<br>
itself.&quot;
<br>
<p>A technical paper providing strong evidence for
<br>
3-dimensional time:
<br>
<p>This is very recent (late 2005):
<br>
<p>&quot;This paper will interpret quantum physics by using
<br>
two extra dimensional time as quantum hidden
<br>
variables. I'll show that three dimensional time is a
<br>
bridge to connect basics quantum physics, relativity 
<br>
and string theory. ``Quantum potential'' in Bohm's
<br>
quantum hidden variable theory is derived from
<br>
Einstein Lagrangian in 6-dimensional time-space
<br>
geometry.  Statistical effect in the measurement of
<br>
single particle, non-local properties, de Broglie wave
<br>
<p>can be naturally derived from the natural properties
<br>
of three dimensional time.&quot;
<br>
<p>...

<br>
<p><p>*Causal models of mathematics:
<br>
<p>&quot;Sets too have a dual-aspect. A Set can be both a
<br>
logical property of the Platonic world and a temporal
<br>
property. As a logical property the Set represents a
<br>
static mathematical object existing in platonic
<br>
reality. But as a temporal property the Set represents
<br>
a *model* of a mathematical object. This is proposed
<br>
to be equivalent to the underlying substance of
<br>
reality itself - Mathematico-Cognition. Curiously then
<br>
, this last property (the 'Set' as a Temporal
<br>
property) is in some sense equivalent to (or contains)
<br>
all the other properties (including itself!), since
<br>
all properties in reality are manifestations of
<br>
Mathematico-Cognition.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p>*Universal Values
<br>
<p>&quot;The idea here is that the one thing a conscious mind
<br>
must value (if it values anything at all), is the
<br>
continuation of consciousness itself (since value
<br>
comes from consciousness). This is not an objective
<br>
basis for values, but it is a universal one.
<br>
<p>To summarize, the ultimate imperative (if the scheme
<br>
is correct), appears to be 'maintain the existence of
<br>
the universe', which is apparently achieved through
<br>
the integration and growth of knowledge (ultimately
<br>
the integration of physical, volitional and
<br>
mathematical properties)
<br>
<p>There are 3 temporal domains - the Physical,
<br>
Volitional and Mathematical. When considering a mind
<br>
which is modeling each of these domains there are 3
<br>
aspects to which value (or utility) could be assigned
<br>
- *reality* itself (events in the external world), the
<br>
*model* of reality and *qualia* (conscious
<br>
experiences). A table of 9 'Universal Utilities' is
<br>
implied. Utilities which are 'good' are those that
<br>
maximally enable the growth, integration and
<br>
self-reflection of knowledge because this is what
<br>
maintains existence itself and also consciousness
<br>
(recall that the underlying fabric of reality itself -
<br>
Mathematico-Cognition - was proposed to be equivalent
<br>
to Qualia - conscious experience).&quot;

<p><p>We've got a couple of canaries on the SL4 list
<br>
unfortuantely.    Come on Wilson and Yudkowsky,
<br>
swallow your pride.  You've got to swallow your pride.

&nbsp;Admit someone knows more than you do.
