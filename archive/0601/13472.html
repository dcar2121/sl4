<p>This extract is a truly distressing self-parody:
<br>
<p>&lt;I propose that Jesus was a special type of XX male ([44]-[49]). 
<br>
Approximately one out of every 20,000 males is an XX male. Such males are 
<br>
normal in behavior and intelligence, but have smaller teeth, shorter 
<br>
statue, and smaller testis than normal males. They are usually identified 
<br>
as XX males because they cannot have children, and ask doctors to cure the 
<br>
infertility. Normal males are XY, but there are only 28 genes on the Y 
<br>
chromosome, as opposed to thousands on the X chromosome. Of these 28 genes, 
<br>
15 are unique to the Y chromosome, and 13 have counterparts on the X 
<br>
chromosome [41]. The gene with counterparts on both the X and the Y 
<br>
chromosomes are called &quot;homologous genes.&quot; An XX male results when a single 
<br>
key gene for maleness on the Y chromosome (the SRY gene) is inserted into 
<br>
an X chromosome. I propose that ALL (or at least many) of the Y chromosome 
<br>
genes were inserted into one of Mary's X chromosomes, and that in Mary, one 
<br>
of the standard mechanisms used to turn off genes were active on these 
<br>
inserted Y genes. (There is an RNA process that can turn off an entire X 
<br>
chromosome. This is the most elegant turn-off mechanism.) Jesus would then 
<br>
result when one of Mary's eggs cells started to divide before it became 
<br>
haploid and with the Y-genes activated. (And of course with the extra X 
<br>
genes deactivated.) If a sample of Jesus' blood and/or flesh could be 
<br>
obtained, my proposal could easily be tested by carrying out two distinct 
<br>
DNA tests for sex: (1) test for the Y genes and (2) test for two alleles 
<br>
(different gene forms) of X chromosome genes. In other words, a male born 
<br>
of a virgin would have two X chromosome genes for each of its counterpart Y 
<br>
gene. Normal males would have only one X chromosome gene for each of its Y 
<br>
counterpart gene. This pairing would apply to each of the 13 genes on the Y 
<br>
chromosome that has an X counterpart.
<br>
<p>Such a Virgin Birth would be improbable. If the measured probability that a 
<br>
single Y gene is inserted into an X chromosome is 1 in 20,000, then the 
<br>
probability that all Y genes are inserted into an X chromosome is 
<br>
(1/20,000) raised to 28 power, the power corresponding to the number of Y 
<br>
genes. (Assuming that the insertion of each Y gene has equal probability, 
<br>
and these insertions are independent.) There have been only about 100 
<br>
billion humans born since behaviorally modern Homo sapiens evolved between 
<br>
55,000 and 80,000 years ago ([74], p. 704). The number of humans that have 
<br>
ever lived is roughly computed as follows. In the first 60,000 years of 
<br>
modern human existence, there were roughly 10 million humans living world 
<br>
wide, with complete replacement every generation, roughly every 30 years. 
<br>
With 2,000 generations in 60,000 years, this means 20 billion people lived 
<br>
in this period. Over the next 6,000 years, humans had agriculture, which 
<br>
allowed the support of a population of roughly 300 million. With 200 
<br>
generations in 6,000 years, this means that 30 billion people lived in this 
<br>
period. Finally we come to the modern period, essentially the period of the 
<br>
people now living. There are now 6 billion people in the world. Adding all 
<br>
these numbers gives about 60 billion people as the total number of people 
<br>
who have ever lived.
<br>
<p>Thus, the virgin birth of such an XX male would be unique in human history 
<br>
even if there were only 2 such Y genes inserted into an X chromosome. (I 
<br>
assume an upper bound to the rate of virgin birth is 1/300. Then the 
<br>
probability of a virgin birth of a male with 2 Y genes is 
<br>
1/(300)(20,000)(20,000) = 1/120 billion.) But as in the case of the 
<br>
Resurrection, if such an event HAD to occur for the universe to evolve into 
<br>
the Omega Point, then the Virgin Birth probability would become one; i.e., 
<br>
certain to occur. In other words, it would be a miracle! &gt;
