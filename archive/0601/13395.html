We're getting waaaaay off topic here, but at least the following *does* 
<br>
involve computers. :)

<p>Absolutely agreed. But for anyone vexed by the paucity of psi papers in 
<br>
mainstream journals, there might be some fun in accessing this, just 
<br>
published in PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS:

<p><p>TESTING FOR TELEPATHY IN CONNECTION WITH E-MAILS
<br>
<p>by Rupert Sheldrake and Pamela Smart
<br>
<p><p><p>SUMMARY
<br>
<p>This study investigated possible telepathic communication in connection 
<br>
with e-mails. On each trial, there were four potential e-mailers, one of 
<br>
whom was selected at random by the experimenter. One minute before a 
<br>
prearranged time at which the e-mail was to be sent, the participant 
<br>
guessed who would send it. 50 participants (29 women and 21 men) were 
<br>
recruited through an employment web site. Of 552 trials, 235 (43%) guesses 
<br>
were hits, significantly above the chance expectation of 25%. Further tests 
<br>
with 5 participants (4 women, 1 man, ages 16 to 29) were videotaped 
<br>
continuously. On the filmed trials, the 64 hits of 137 (47%) were 
<br>
significantly above chance.
