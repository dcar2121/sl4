There seems to be some talk about AGI programmers having to be good 
<br>
learners. We seem to be forgetting one little detail; AGI hasn’t been 
<br>
INVENTED yet. AGI programmers would have to invent AGI using new and 
<br>
creative approaches. I agree that to invent new concepts, one would have to 
<br>
understand the base on which on builds up on and this would require decent 
<br>
learning skills however, that doesn’t mean they will be able to advance the 
<br>
field one bit. My point is, a physics degree is not an indicator of AGI 
<br>
programming potential. We should be looking for people making creative 
<br>
breakthroughs (in technical fields, not fine arts creativity).

<em>&gt; &gt; At the inaugural colloquium of the Redwood Neuroscience Institute,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was a discussion among some (major, prestigious) computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neuroscientists about what kind of degree they'd most like to hire.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some said neurology, some said electrical engineering, but then one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person said, &quot;I'd rather have someone with a degree in physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because they can learn anything,&quot; and the rest nodded agreement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;??? -People with a physics degree can learn anything, as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people with a degree in neurology or ee? People with a physics degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can severely lack in memory, and in social/communication skills.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Speaking of which, if I were you I'd emphasize the communication skills
</em><br>
<em>&gt;requirement more. Not the &quot;you should be capable of communicating with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone&quot;, but if you want to be part of a team you should be capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communicating well with other members of the team. About technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things and about non-technical things. Because someone not being able
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to communicate his annoyance with one of the other team-members and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem hence escalating could be real BAD. Having majored in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Biomedical Science &amp; Engineering, AI, EE, and Neuroscience at different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universities for smaller and larger amounts of time makes it real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious to me that in all of the areas you might find people from there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are tons of people who are severely lacking in people skills (which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't mean that I wasn't/am not one of them).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important requirement, obviously, is that the one be able to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anything.  It is also indispensable that the one already be a math
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; talent, and have some experience programming, because there are some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; things I'm not willing to bother teaching.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd rather teach a brilliant person math/programming than teach them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how to communicate, self-control, emotional stability, etc. That said,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree that math/programming is extremely important. Now, a brilliant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;person should be capable of learning all the prerequisite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;math/programming on his own without much help from anyone, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't mean you should hire someone who doesn't meet those prereqs. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thought the article was alright, it said way too much obvious stuff for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me, but knowing normal intelligent people I think that that's likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be necessary.
