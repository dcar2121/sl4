<p>This seems to be entirely too pessimistic and optimistic to me;
<br>
you seem to be assuming there is no overlap here-
<br>
if you obtain a PhD in mathematics, I think cognitive science and
<br>
computer science would go a lot faster than for someone without
<br>
any comparable background. Thus 100 years is too perssimistic.
<br>
But it will still take a long time, and given how quickly some of those fields
<br>
can advance, quite possibly by the time one finished all 20 or whatever,
<br>
a good deal with be completely outdated. You could try to keep up, but at the
<br>
end, could you keep up in 19 fields while obtaining a PhD in a 20th?
<br>
<p>The point I guess I'm trying to get at is that it will take multiple people
<br>
to even begin to constitute a single &quot;Seed-AI developer&quot;.
