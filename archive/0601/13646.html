</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You missed the point.  A corporation can own stock in corporations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; including itself.  The corporation can own anything including hardware.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your original post: &quot;a corporate AI ... owns a controlling block of stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in itself&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That doesn't make any sense as far as I can see. Legally, an AI being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered akin to a vase or rock, cannot own any shares in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation. The term &quot;corporate AI&quot; as you're using it makes no sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can an AI attempt to maintain control over the actions of a corporation via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various methods without actually itself owning the controlling stock?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps, but as I mentioned in my first message such an arrangement seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather pointless and overcomplicated. The AI in such a case is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property of the corporation, and relies on its control mechanisms over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans who actually perform the actions of the corporation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think that the idea is that the corporation would own the computer which 
<br>
controlled the corporation, and that the corporation would also own itself.  
<br>
Legally the computer would be a chattel of the corporation, as if your body 
<br>
owned your brain.  (Except that a body is physical, and a corporation is a 
<br>
non-physical abstraction.)
<br>
<p>I find it weird that corporations would be granted any legal rights at all, 
<br>
but actuality forces me to admit that as a practical matter they have been.  
<br>
Given that a corporation can own a controlling interest in itself (I'm not 
<br>
sure about that one!), then this seems like a perfectly reasonable approach 
<br>
under the current legal system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See above. The corporation that owns the AI property would have rights, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercising and/or defending those rights would be delegated to the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; officers in control of the corporation. The AI itself has no direct rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all.
</em><br>
Can corporations be corporate officers?  On their own board?   If so then a 
<br>
self-standing autonomous corporate entity might require three corporations.  
<br>
With interlocking directorates.  One for president, one for secretary, and 
<br>
one for treasurer. (I seem to recall that those three offices were required 
<br>
and needed to be different &quot;persons&quot;.)  If they can't be directors on their 
<br>
own board, then this is expanded to 4 corporations per individual.  And if 
<br>
they can't be on a board at all (HAH!), then the scheme falls apart at the 
<br>
hands of human greed.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If Eliezer is right about the speed with which a seed AI goes way beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans, the problem will be humans keeping any rights at all rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; figuring out how AIs of human level or above should be treated at law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, and I happen to agree. But I can't resist being pedantic on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little thread for some reason.
