<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----

<em>&gt; From: <a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sl4.org?Subject=RE:%20Self%20Improvement">owner-sl4@sl4.org</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sl4.org?Subject=RE:%20Self%20Improvement">owner-sl4@sl4.org</a>] On Behalf Of H C

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Modality level: reading, speed reading (how effective is this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; anybody?),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Extremely -- 2500 WPM is easily reproducible, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;some claim 25,000+ but I haven't personally achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Haha.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Honestly. How much are you really accomplishing here?
</em><br>
<p>About 10 times more per unit of time that I did
<br>
before learning the skill.
<br>
<p>Most educated people read at 200-450 WPM.
<br>
<p>2500 WPM with similar comprehension is attainable
<br>
through moderate but serious practice.
<br>
<p>For many people, comprehension improves, but my
<br>
(typical) comprehension rates had always been
<br>
95-100% in 'normal' reading so I typically lose
<br>
a few percentage points down to 90%+.
<br>
<p>Even if someone loses comprehension, then reading
<br>
'three times' still gives a 3 to 1 increase and
<br>
this is almost certainly at increased comprehension.
<br>
<p>I use the Photoreading techniques this way -- since
<br>
I cannot &quot;really read&quot; at the 25,000 WPM levels.
<br>
For the first reading I will move at that speed, 
<br>
about 2,000-10,000 for the second, and selective
<br>
'normal speed reading' (1500-3000) for the third
<br>
pass.
<br>
<p>This works for me, and so I don't dismiss the higher
<br>
speed techniques just because my comprehension
<br>
ON THAT WOULD be low if I were to quit after one
<br>
view.
<br>
<p>Notice that final reading rates must be computed 
<br>
with ALL reading &quot;time&quot; included or the rates are
<br>
not fairly stated.
<br>
<p>For 'normal speed reading' rates on single pass 
<br>
are commonly 2500 WPM -- Speed reading doesn't
<br>
even begin until about 1200-1500 WPM.  It takes
<br>
such speeds to force the conversion from &quot;normal
<br>
reading methods&quot; to true speed reading.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Concept level: I think that most people do not often generate new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; concepts except as children. Concepts can be serialized 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into text or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; speech, and then re-encoded by another human, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; transfer is lossy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is an interesting observation. I also think that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is an area I excell in.
</em><br>
<p>Cool.  One way to improve is to find some (perceived)
<br>
weakness and model a person who has a skill that 
<br>
addresses it.  (Modeling is a set of explicit techniques
<br>
that range over many modalities including strategies
<br>
but also beliefs and mental representation plus others.)
<br>
<p>One can also model one's own skills and frequently
<br>
improve them through making them explicit.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Creating new concepts is like learning a new language. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anything can mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything, and every clue you get about the meaning must be taken into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account... not just considered, but actually applied and checked for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also I think it is relevant to distinguish between generating new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance-level concepts and new category-level concepts. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your life is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lived by integrating and operating within a vast sea of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance data then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are really making little constructive progress in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding; as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to operating within the realm of category concepts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that generalize 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across a domain of other category concepts (until eventually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lining up on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the instance level).
</em><br>
<p>Scale and level of detail are very important concepts
<br>
in modeling, learning in general, and troubleshooting
<br>
(including optimization of processes and procedures.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem with this being, integrating category level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts under other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categories is a potentially huge algorithmic task for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; checking consistency 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on an instance level. You have to really be able to make good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ass guesses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and somehow understand how to verify these guesses using 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited resources.
</em><br>
<p>Verification is a key element -- doing such things
<br>
and just hand waving results is part of the &quot;new
<br>
age crap&quot; that some of these techniques have evolved
<br>
within.
<br>
<p>The secret in my opinion is to extract AND TEST those
<br>
techniques that actually work.
<br>
<p>Hypnosis is a prime example.  Both self-hypnosis
<br>
and hypnosis by another are powerful tools in 
<br>
learning and self-improvement, but it is key to
<br>
extract the valuable techniques from the mythology
<br>
that surrounds the subject (mythologies actually,
<br>
since both critics and fans misunderstand this
<br>
subject in most instances.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, I think the best resources for immediate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improvement is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area of meta-knowledge like this. Knowing how to &quot;know how&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an efficient manner.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  This is a SLIGHTLY meta skill to knowing how
<br>
to model (model one's self or modeling others.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -hegem0n
</em><br>
<p>Typically the difference between an 'average amateur'
<br>
and a world class performer is at least an order
<br>
of magnitude, and we see this in sports because of
<br>
the measurement that sports offers -- both statistical
<br>
and monetary measurements create a sieve for identifying
<br>
those with exceptional skills.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately in NON-sports fields we tend to think
<br>
that the &quot;average performances&quot; we see every day are
<br>
typical of what CAN be achieved.
<br>
<p>Reading is a clear example.  Take an average educated
<br>
reader (300WMP) and in 6-10 weeks of consistent*
<br>
practice that person can read 2500 WPM with better or
<br>
similar comprehension.
<br>
<p>* Consistent practice == 1 hour per day, minimum 6 days
<br>
per week (6-10 weeks.)
<br>
<p>One really cool thing about the reading practice is that
<br>
speeds will typically double in the first week so you
<br>
quickly see a net gain (assuming you read a lot) right
<br>
away.
<br>
<p>But be warned:  Speed reading is ALMOST EXACTLY analogous
<br>
to weight lifting:  Practicing speed reading is one of the
<br>
most inane activities (like pumping iron) you can perform,
<br>
and it is about as unpleasant as moving dumbbells.
<br>
<p>The pleasure must come from your mental images of the
<br>
improvements you are earning.
