<p>This is not the case when it comes to AGI; getting it wrong could be
<br>
far worse than doing nothing. A critical failure of Friendliness is a
<br>
pretty bad existential risk.

<p><em>&gt; It seems intuitive that encouraging people _not_ to

</em><br>
<p>Unless encouraging people who are on the low end of &quot;genius&quot; means
<br>
increasing the odds that the first successful AGI will be less
<br>
Friendly than it would have been, had the standards of AGI project
<br>
recruiters been less compromising.
<br>
<p>Speed and safety are competing factors in this. Do you try to start
<br>
the Singularity as quickly as possible, or wait until you're really
<br>
sure you can do it right, with as much margin for error as possible? I
<br>
get the impression that the seed developer qualifications page is not
<br>
just firmly on the side of safety, but designed to make sure that
<br>
people motivated by speed who read it will be personally dissuaded.
