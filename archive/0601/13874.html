<p><p>Well, &quot;since you determined how it would be, you had power over it, and it
<br>
is you&quot; would seem to imply that if you write a book for example, and it
<br>
survives indefinitely, this is a form of immortality? (I'm not saying this
<br>
view is right or wrong, just checking whether it is your view.)
<br>
<p>A better way of explaing it is; suppose we discard the idea of a broad
<br>
<em>&gt; self. Then we have a phase-space of entitys lasting for mere instants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (possibly longer if it is static).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the real question becomes; why should one entity be loyal towards any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular future entity?
</em><br>
<p><p>Some people want personal survival for its own sake (myself included, though
<br>
it isn't my highest value).
<br>
<p>A more general idea would be that you should be loyal to those future
<br>
entities which share or contribute to your values; that would seem to be
<br>
consistent with your thinking.
<br>
<p>Pragmaticism, the entitys which it has power over, are those through which
<br>
<em>&gt; it can acheive it's goals(this is where I stretch it a bit).
</em><br>
<p><p>This would seem consistent with the &quot;entities which share or contribute to
<br>
your values&quot; idea above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wouldn't view a static utopia as desirable. Whether a continuous loop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well I could use the word perfect or eternal utopia instead, if a pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is you, and surviving is good, then it follows that preserving the pattern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is desirable.
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;Perfect&quot; and &quot;utopia&quot; are rather vague concepts, I think I'd need to see a
<br>
more detailed proposal for one before I could really comment on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; could reasonably be called &quot;static&quot; depends on the length of the loop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (consider for example a loop of length 2^N where N is the number of bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; describing a particular mind state within some broad category).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - Russell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand the maths, do you mean; the loop is larger than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mind, or that it grows as the mind grows.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, let's suppose you go into a loop, but the loop is, say, 10^30
<br>
subjective years long before you start repeating yourself, and the total
<br>
number of thoughts and experiences you have during those 10^30 years are
<br>
much larger than could fit into your mind at any one time; I suppose that
<br>
would count as &quot;the loop is larger than just the mind&quot;.
