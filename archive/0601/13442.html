<p>If psi is *not* part of the world, as I believe, then it may not be 
<br>
possible to make psi part of the world without everything else being 
<br>
wrong.  Lies need not be consistent with truth, and a single 
<br>
contradiction proves everything.  Reality, on the other hand, is always 
<br>
consistent with reality; there are many maps but only one territory; and 
<br>
apples did not stop falling when Einstein's *theory* overthrew Newton's 
<br>
*theory*.  So if psi was real, then there would be some way to integrate 
<br>
psi such that not everything else we knew would be wrong - apples would 
<br>
not stop falling.  It is only because psi is not real that you think 
<br>
that psi would invalidate everything, and it is because psi would 
<br>
invalidate everything that you think it is not real.  This is, in cold 
<br>
sober fact, circular logic, or more kindly a consistent worldview, and 
<br>
there is the possibility of both arcs of the loop being invalidated 
<br>
simultaneously.

<p><em>&gt; From my perspective, from decision theory for humans purposes, the entire

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&quot;Everything you know is wrong&quot; has been true through quite a lot of 
<br>
human history, at least in the sense of being able to encompass things 
<br>
just as shocking as magic - such as the total absence of magic.  In 
<br>
fact, most people still haven't come to terms with the total absence of 
<br>
magic, which tells you something about how shocking it is.
