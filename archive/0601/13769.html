I am curious to know if the author of the &quot;Becoming a Seed AI
<br>
Programmer&lt;<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/action/seed-ai-programmer.html">http://www.intelligence.org/action/seed-ai-programmer.html</a>&gt;
<br>
&quot; would consider an actual test for what it takes to be a friendly AI
<br>
developer.  If one were to pass the test, they would be admitted to the
<br>
resource pool and given responsibility/involvement according to demonstrated
<br>
talent and understanding.  This same test would then be used to test the
<br>
evolved/created AGI.  When the AGI is able to pass the test to become a
<br>
friendly AI developer, then I would argue that it should be given equal
<br>
status as any other &quot;new guy&quot; on the team.  If this doesn't prove
<br>
consciousness or self awareness or intelligence or whatever you (anyone)
<br>
want to measure, then I doubt there is any sufficient test that can satisfy
<br>
as 'proof.'
<br>
<p>I don't know that a definitive test is intrinsically valuable anyway.  Few
<br>
of our coworkers would pass any rigorously scientific measurement for
<br>
'intelligence' - and probably fewer of our neighbors.  From &quot;Shock Level
<br>
Analysis &lt;<a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/singularity/shocklevelanalysis.html">http://www.kheper.net/topics/singularity/shocklevelanalysis.html</a>&gt;&quot;
<br>
an AGI worth testing would probably be SL3 at inception, which would include
<br>
it in a population of less than one hundred thousand - what group is
<br>
qualified to test this level of mental adaptation and preparedness to the
<br>
impending Singularity?  If we live among and work with non-human AI to the
<br>
mutual advantage of both parties, what purpose is served by an ego-driven
<br>
test for superiority?
