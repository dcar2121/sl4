<p><p>Tangent:  A few States in the US recognize limited liability

constructs that completely separate stock ownership from control in  
<br>
for-profit businesses -- a non-economic controlling interest.
<br>
<p>The was invented (relatively recently as I recall) as a way for  
<br>
parties to control vast assets but with no meaningful economic value  
<br>
that could ever be attached or seized by the government e.g. in a  
<br>
civil suit.  The obvious application is a shelter for assets that one  
<br>
never intends to liquidate for direct personal consumption which one  
<br>
can still wield for all manner of purpose.  Because the interest is  
<br>
non-economic, the restrictions are less and control is nearly  
<br>
impossible to take away (though I am quite sure they expect a Natural  
<br>
Person at some point in the chain of responsibility).
<br>
<p>In a few locales, a controlling interest so structured does not even  
<br>
need to have much resembling legal visibility, allowing control to be  
<br>
buried and transferred in such a way that it would take a concerted  
<br>
judicial effort by the government to even get a hint that an AI was  
<br>
running things in practice.  It would make a very bizarre and utterly  
<br>
fascinating legal case.
<br>
<p>I am not sure what the point is though, since even humans have  
<br>
limited free agency.  One could achieve the same effective result for  
<br>
AI without getting all sly and tricky.
