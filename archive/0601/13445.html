<p>Self-evidently. I truly don't understand the panic. Of course, it depends 
<br>
on the scale of the thing. Again, it seems to me that this FUD arises only 
<br>
because people who haven't looked into the topic closely are making exactly 
<br>
the same kind of mistake most civilians make when they confuse Hollywood 
<br>
genomics or artificial intelligence with the real (or at any rate 
<br>
scientifically plausible) thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;Everything you know is wrong&quot; has been true through quite a lot of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history, at least in the sense of being able to encompass things just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shocking as magic
</em><br>
<p>The irony for SL4 is that this premise of serial and genuinely shocking 
<br>
paradigm change, drawn from the history of science, underlies so much of 
<br>
the discussion about singularity and beyond.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In fact, most people still haven't come to terms with the total absence of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;magic, which tells you something about how shocking it is.
</em><br>
<p>A deft rhetorical move, but it smuggles in an equation between traditional 
<br>
contagious and sympathetic magic--and perhaps religious miracles--and the 
<br>
generally small anomalies studied by contemporary parapsychologists. Those 
<br>
anomalies are genuinely puzzling, and could indeed constitute a breach in 
<br>
current paradigms equivalent to the ultraviolet catastrophe that led to 
<br>
quantum theory -- but it seems very unlikely &lt;coff&gt; to me *even if psi 
<br>
turns out to be real* that anyone will be teleporting or levitating by 
<br>
sheer force of personality, or transmuting old bananas into uranium by 
<br>
muttering a spell, or reviving the dead with an application of foetal 
<br>
blood. No, that sort of thing will require ordinary unexceptional post 
<br>
singularity technology, the kind everyone here is extremely comfortable with.
