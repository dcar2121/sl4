<p>Richard's general account, here snipped, is spot on, and I'm glad he took 
<br>
the trouble to spell out patiently the points I made in highly compressed 
<br>
form yesterday. But to concentrate on just the example cited above: this 
<br>
account will doubtless be taken by some as adequate evidence that there is 
<br>
no such phenomenon (after all, these parapsychologists worked very hard to 
<br>
predict roulette numbers, and failed; this disconfirms precognition, let's 
<br>
move on). Suppose, by contrast, they had succeeded. Their winnings would 
<br>
have been small (the stake was only 50 quid, after all). Yet it had taken 
<br>
them hundreds of tedious hours expended over months to get that far. In 
<br>
other words, the supposed test of the reality of psi, the ability to profit 
<br>
in a casino or lottery by precognition, would probably not have 
<br>
earth-shaking consequences unless many thousands of psi-talented and 
<br>
inhumanly patient people could be conscripted to the task.
<br>
<p>I think the key to the credibility problem, at least among thinkers 
<br>
characteristic of this list, is the difficulty in retaining a distinction 
<br>
between inanimate physical systems that are highly reliable, even if 
<br>
entirely novel, such as x-ray machines, and purposive, complex, opaque 
<br>
cognitive/emotive systems (&quot;human beings&quot;, for short). It seems completely 
<br>
reasonable to some people to expect that if humans can do Y, and you know 
<br>
how to do Y, you should be able to do it every time you're asked to. That 
<br>
is largely true of such tasks as tying your shoe laces, but it breaks down 
<br>
badly when an artist is challenged to &quot;Go ahead, then, if you're so 
<br>
`creative', write a book/paint a painting/compose a symphony, and make a 
<br>
million dollars with it!&quot; Even so routine a human experience as falling in 
<br>
love has proved to be unpredictable, even zany. Those humans! So much more 
<br>
irritating than simple machines.
