<p>I assume this is Hansel's *The Search for Psychic Power: ESP&amp; 
<br>
Parapsychology Revisited*. I haven't read that, but the earlier editions 
<br>
were particularly grotesque in their misrepresentations and bizarre 
<br>
attempts to offer possible fraudulent means for high-scoring (this sort of 
<br>
thing, as it were: the experimenter might have left his room on the other 
<br>
side of the University and run across while the subject was guessing and 
<br>
very quietly with nobody noticing got a chair from an adjacent room and 
<br>
climbed up on it to look through the transom using a mirror and written 
<br>
down the subject's calls, then dashed back and copied them into his log as 
<br>
if they had been the randomised targets). If I had my marked-up copy of the 
<br>
1980 in edition with me, I'd provide some of the really laughable examples, 
<br>
of which that invented instance was a close approximation. In general, as I 
<br>
noted in my own book:
<br>
<p>=======================
<br>
<p>Although Schmidt has never been found cheating, he's been subjected to some 
<br>
really quite venomous armchair attacks by such famous critics as Martin 
<br>
Gardner and Professor C. E. M. Hansel. Certain features of Schmidt's 
<br>
results, Hansel charged, `suggests that sampling from a common distribution 
<br>
may have taken place', a phrase which seems to me a direct implication of 
<br>
fraud. Interestingly, the same features­-HI, LO and Baseline distributions 
<br>
adding up to an overall Gaussian or standard bell-shaped curve­-have since 
<br>
turned up in Jahn's much larger body of evidence, and been incorporated in 
<br>
the PEAR model of psi.
<br>
<p>Hansel did not quite go so far as an accusation of fraud: `Perhaps what has 
<br>
been written here will indicate reasons for questioning the proof supplied 
<br>
by Schmidt without implying that he need necessarily have been more than a 
<br>
careless experimenter...' All these accusations are indirect and 
<br>
hypothetical; there is absolutely no reason to entertain them other than a 
<br>
priori and inviolable skepticism itself, proof against every conceivable 
<br>
counter-example.
<br>
<p>============
<br>
<p>But in fact 71 significant experiments out of 332 (21.4%) seems pretty 
<br>
close to what one might expect for a low effect size phenomenon:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/psi/delanoy/node7.html">http://www.tcm.phy.cam.ac.uk/~bdj10/psi/delanoy/node7.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt;It should be noted that small effects have low statistical power [8, 12, 
<br>
13]. For example, the aspirin study involved over 22,000 subjects. If there 
<br>
had only been 3,000 subjects, the investigators would have had less than a 
<br>
50 percent chance of finding a conventionally significant effect [13]. 
<br>
Given the small effect sizes which are typical in psi experiments, low 
<br>
replicability is to be expected. Rosenthal [17] notes that ``even though 
<br>
controversial research areas are characterised by small effects, that does 
<br>
not mean that the effects are of no practical importance.'' (p. 324). 
<br>
Indeed, in an article addressing behavioural research in general, Rosenthal 
<br>
[35] warned: ``Given the levels of statistical power at which we normally 
<br>
operate, we have no right to expect the proportion of significant results 
<br>
that we typically do expect, even if in nature there is a very real and 
<br>
very important effect'' (p. 16).&gt;
