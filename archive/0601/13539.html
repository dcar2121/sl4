Well you need to get her drunk first.  A massage.  Good music helps too...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, I don't think it's wise to make conscious beings.  There are ethical problems such as: if we piss it off it might kill all of us.  I'm hoping AI will be done without minds.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned through nanotech studies that deposition reaction procedures are very substrate specific.  I would think this will carry over to minds too.  If we want to clone Jeff Medina, I don't think any amount of silicon-based brain structures are going to do, no matter what topography we use.  We would need to use carbon-based chemistries.  There are EM fields that can be detected originating within human brains.  Transposing carbon with silicon would change/eliminate the fields.  The fields themselves aren't what is conscious, but for now things like an EEG are the best markers we have.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know you can't reproduce EM fields on conventional computer simulations.  They're just there in the physical world.  As soon as you produce a brain architecture that shows electrical activities and emits EM fields similiar to what our brains emit, then it is time to be scared for the human race.  I don't know what kind of architectures this encompasses, but I know it rules out 2006 computer hardwares.  There was a kid who made a Scanning Tunneling Microscope out of lego, but the fineprint reveals he used other non-lego components.

<p>This is a widely contested/unaccepted claim among computer scientists
<br>
and physical scientists, Phillip. Hence, I'd greatly appreciate if you

would include arguments for your claims about what probably will or

will not be needed in the future to create a conscious being.
