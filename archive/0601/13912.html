While I would agree that not every member needs to have knowledge of
<br>
physics, I think it is certainly helpful for someone on a team to have
<br>
that knowledge. I think all of the requirements that people suggest
<br>
should be interpreted in terms of a team.
<br>
<p>The reason why I stated that statistical mechanics and thermodynamics
<br>
are necessary for an AGI team is because both are the study of very
<br>
complex systems and the hardware and software necessary for a human
<br>
level AGI will require very large structured systems. This complexity
<br>
can be moved either a bit to the side of hardware or a bit to the side
<br>
of software, but the complexity remains.  Moreover, thermodynamics can
<br>
tell you things about systems even when you don't know the details of
<br>
how the system is made.  In fact, this is the divide between
<br>
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics: Statistical mechanics is for
<br>
when you care what the system is made of and thermodynamics is for
<br>
when you don't.
<br>
<p>I think you need to look into biophysics a bit more if you think it
<br>
isn't necessary for creating a DNA computer. Biophysics is in large
<br>
part applied statistical mechanics (e.g. Brownian motion).

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Huh? You don't need a PhD. in all of those subjects!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It would certainly help to be well-rounded, but it is crazy to require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Ph.D. in (e.g.) M-Theory.  Heck, a couple of undergrad physics courses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and a dose of Brian Greene ought to be enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;A dose of Brian Greene is just about useless. What could be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;useful for AGI is... thermodynamics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Useful, possibly.  How is it _necessary_?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a Seed AI encoded on DNA... Does anyone deny this as a possibility?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a project going about creating a Seed AI using DNA.  Sure, it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arse-about way to go about it today, but if our genetics knowledge were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater (times many many)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The original physics developments needed to create such a seed AI?  Nowt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The advanced physics knowledge needed by the development team? Nowt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The simple physics knowledge needed by the team?  Hrmmm... could be useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help the seed AI get a grip on reality... before it learned advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics for itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The simple physics knowledge needed by most members of the development team?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Zip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some well rounded knowledge could be useful to help the project know where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't need to go.  F'rinstance, some Neurology and Quantum mech might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be useful for an AGI team to know that Penrose's &quot;brain /= computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine&quot; objections are, at best, tangential to AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But not every team member needs to be a polymath.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Polymaths are useful.  At least, I hope so, as I have a limited degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vested interest in demand for polymaths.  But not every member of a team has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a pan-Paragon for the team to achieve amazing things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Teams ought to combine individuals' skills and abilities in compounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways.  They need to be able to communicate on the application of specialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities.  That doesn't mean everyone has to be an expert in all areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not playing down what's required to be on a successful AGI team.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I &quot;get&quot; (a lot of) AI and cog-sci theory, I can't programme for shit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   So don't hire me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But don't turn down a great neuroscientist/cog scientist with meta-math and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming skills (think: Giulio Tononi crossed with Jaynes, with coding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills) just because they don't know diddley about networking / operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems / number theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Put them in a team, and make them useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Olie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More examples:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - If the AGI project is not utilising nanotech, no nanotech knowledge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required.  If it's using existing nanotech (eg: nanocomputers supplied by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3rd party, which are faster but appear identcal to conventional computers),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no nanotech knowledge is required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Much is made about rationality tools.   Any AGI project will have &gt;=1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality tool (eg: Bayesian reasoning), so all programmers will likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have *some* connection to the AGI's use of rationality tools.  But if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can institute the programming, does it really matter whether or not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers are themselves hyper-rational?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they are knowledgeable and insightful, does it matter if *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teammembers have mediocre &quot;Judgement Quotients&quot;?  If they occasionally have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a teary over which O/S they have to programme with, does this matter outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of team morale issues?  I fail to see how such natural deficiencies are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with well managed teams.
