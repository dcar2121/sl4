<em>&gt; Why must we preserve economic systems where people suffer?  The common-sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I speak of is the very simple fact that physical pain is bad.  Are you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There are several problems with what you're saying.
<br>
<p>One is that we can't preserve other animals in the absence of pain.
<br>
Pain is an important motivator in their lives.  Suffering is a consequence
<br>
of having the freedom to evolve.  You can't put the lions in one simulation
<br>
and the gazelles in another - then you are separating each element of
<br>
the ecosystem out into its own simulation, and within each simulation,
<br>
only one species can be simulated in enough detail to allow
<br>
consciousness, or else the other species in that simulation will be
<br>
conscious and suffer.  There are many other related problems that I
<br>
will not enumerate here.  Essentially, you can't cheat by simulating
<br>
everything and eliminating the parts you don't like, the way 17th-century
<br>
deists criticized the Christian God for not doing.  You end up with
<br>
something unreal whose existence can't be justified.
<br>
<p>The more important one - which I already explained in my previous
<br>
reply, so I won't explain it again, but I will put in in caps this time -
<br>
is that THE LION STANDS IN RELATIONSHIP TO US IN THE SAME
<br>
WAY THAT WE STAND IN RELATION TO AN AI.  You say we have
<br>
the moral authority to put the lion in a fake simulation without asking
<br>
or telling it.  Hence the AI has the moral authority to put us in the
<br>
Matrix, or dispose of us in any way it sees fit.
<br>
<p>This is not a recipe for a good singularity.  UNLESS WE PROVIDE
<br>
A NEW ETHICAL FRAMEWORK PRE-SINGULARITY, humans
<br>
will assume that transhumans will operate in just the way Huggins
<br>
is proposing, and they will (justifiably) either prevent anyone from
<br>
developing transhuman technology (which is EXACTLY what Leon
<br>
Kass is doing now, for roughly the same reason that I just gave!),
<br>
or they will KILL TRANSHUMANS ON SIGHT.
<br>
