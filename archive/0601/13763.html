<p>
Jeff Medina,
<br>
<p>That the so called bioconservatives point to some aspects of the world 
<br>
highly valued by most humans, then suggest that transhumanist are against 
<br>
them, is simple libel.  Loss of knowledge *is* a valid concern, so is loss 
<br>
of diversity, and loss of beauty.
<br>
<p>Please note that you misquoted me.  I did not write &quot;lose 'beautiful 
<br>
pain/melancholy/heartache/etc.'&quot; and neither did I intend to.  I wrote 
<br>
&quot;[lose] the beauty we see in them&quot;.  I was referring to the experience of 
<br>
beauty we feel when exposed to natural settings in many of Earth's 
<br>
ecosystems.  This is a highly valued aspect of life for people the world 
<br>
over, many of them 'city dwelling' people.  I was also referring to the 
<br>
beauty people often perceive when observing intricate ecosystems (seemingly) 
<br>
unaffected by humans.  These experiences, and the potential for them, are 
<br>
valued by humans.  They are also valued by transhumans.  Anyone who suggests 
<br>
otherwise surely hasn't met many transhumans, or parhaps has not understood 
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Your assumption is a little misstated.  It is not &quot;death and suffering are 
<br>
unnecessary and must be defeated&quot;, it is &quot;Eliminating involuntary death and 
<br>
unnecessary suffering will greatly improve the human condition&quot;.  As you 
<br>
might see, the implications of the two statements are quite different.
<br>
<p>As for drawing a line between &quot;human-ish&quot; wild animals and others that are 
<br>
less so: I do not.  That line was drawn at mammals (AFAICT) by Phillip 
<br>
Huggan, and I disagree with him on this point.  Two lines, probably fuzzy 
<br>
ones, must be and should be drawn somewhere along the dimensions of 
<br>
intelligence and biological maturity dividing those beings who are given the 
<br>
ability to choose (to not die - line #1, to not suffer - line #2) from those 
<br>
who are not.  The ability to choose not to die being given to (I tentatively 
<br>
suggest) beings who have grasped the concepts of life and death and some of 
<br>
the main implications surrounding those states.  The ability to choose not 
<br>
to suffer being given to (again hesitantly suggested) beings who have 
<br>
progressed to adulthood - a stage that can be defined socially, 
<br>
biologically, and in many other ways.  Of course the whole time I am talking 
<br>
about humans here - the lines are *within* the human species, not outside 
<br>
it.  Humans should arrange for wild animals to remain wild - and continue 
<br>
evolving - see my previous arguments for reasons.  If we want to keep some 
<br>
as pets, well... that is a different discussion.

<p><p>Michael Roy Ames said:
<br>
<em>&gt; The suffering of wild animals is not a problem that requires a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution.  The obliteration of ecosystems along with the attendant loss of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, of biodiversity, and of the beauty we see in them *is* a real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressing problem.
</em><br>
<p>This is an excellent summation of one of the 'bioconservative'
<br>
responses to transhumanism more generally. &quot;The suffering of humans is
<br>
not a problem that requires a solution; we will disrupt society (i.e.
<br>
the human ecosystem), lose knowledge, lose diversity, lose 'beautiful
<br>
pain/melancholy/heartache/etc.'&quot;
<br>
<p>So, now, assuming you aren't against the whole H+/S'n &quot;death and
<br>
suffering are unnecessary and must be defeated&quot; deal, why in the world
<br>
are you drawing a line between wild animals that happen to be
<br>
human-ish and wild animals that are less so?
