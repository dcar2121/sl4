The reason this argument is a strawman is because we know to some degree how emotions work.  We know it really has little if any to do with computation.  We know it is a chemical hormonal process.  Physical not computational.  Everbody knows carbon is a more versatile element for chemical processes than is silicon.  This has to do with valence shells  and electron affinities.  Nothing to do with any computational switching.  The odds of finding silicon-based life out there are zero.  I would say silicon based emotions are maybe possible in principle, but impossible to engineer on present computer architectures.  We're not seriously going to debate that hormones are computational, are we?  We're not seriously going to suggest a person made of legos can be sad, are we?

<p><em>&gt; Why will *computer programs* above a complexity threshold

<p>And where did people get the bizarre notion that feelings are more
<br>
difficult to come up with than intelligent action? Evolution found the
<br>
exact opposite to be true. Most emotions come from the old reptilian
<br>
part of our brain and that is about 450 million years old. The newer
<br>
part, the part that distinguishes us from other animals, the part that
<br>
comes up with smart ideas, is only about one million years old.
<br>
<p>And that’s not the only data point we have; which do you personally find
<br>
more difficult to consistently produce, actions that are very smart or
<br>
feelings? I unfortunately have far more feelings than very smart ideas,
<br>
and I do not think I’m unusual in that regard.
<br>
<p>You could make a stronger case that computers may someday be emotional
<br>
if they are not already, but they could never be smart; although I think
<br>
they will do both.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe electrons and silicon will do it for
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Because everybody knows carbon is a far more emotional element than
<br>
silicon and ions are more self aware than electrons.
