<em>&gt;(Judgment Quotient)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Judgement Quotient Test 1.0
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-These questions might seem... familiar :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--First of all, how well does everyone score, second of all, did I get the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answers right? :-p
</em><br>
<p>Did you get the questions right?
<br>
<p>Some require certain prior knowledge, others &quot;expect&quot; that you don't use 
<br>
prior knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1. A random sample of 100 professionals was done. Seventy of those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interviewed were lawyers, and thirty of those interviewed were engineers. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dick is a 30 year old man. He is married and has no children. A man of high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ability and high motivation, he promises to be quite sucesful in his field. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He is well liked by his colleagues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a.What is the probability that Dick is a lawyer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;b.What is the probability that Dick is an engineer:
</em><br>
<p>Hang on; are any of the lawyers also engineers?  The question says nothing 
<br>
about that, but common knowledge says that it's not common for lawyers to 
<br>
also be engineers.  I do know some people who are on the bar, who also have 
<br>
other professions.
<br>
<p>Does it make any difference?  (There is a correct answer).
<br>
<p>Common knowledge, combined with the other factors, might also skew the 
<br>
possibilities.  Lawyers might be significantly more likely to have kids.
<br>
<p>Do we bring in common knowledge, or take the questions in isolation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2. A certain town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;45 babies are born each day, and in the smaller hospital about 15 babies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are born each day. As you know, 50 percent of all babies born are boys.
</em><br>
<p>That's not actually true - 
<br>
www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/PT90book_V2.pdf
<br>
<p>So, no, I didn't know that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, the exact percentage may be higher or lower on any given day. For 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a period of 1 year, each hospital kept a record of how many days more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;60% of the babies born were boys.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which hospital recorded more such days?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The larger hospital, or the smaller hospital, or the same (within 5 percent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of each other).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;5. Suppose there is some student who made A's and B's in 9th and 10th 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grade, and straight A's in eleventh and twelth grade. Assuming that only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10% of college freshman make straight A's their first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;semester, what would you guess the probability is that this student makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;straight A's- greater or less than 50%?
</em><br>
<p>Again, common knowledge (correlation)?  What proportion of 11th and 12th 
<br>
grade students get straight A's?
<br>
<p>If only 1% of 11s and 12s get straight As, this does significantly impact 
<br>
the question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;9. Suppose that...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, suppose John is enrolled in an introductory computer science class in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his freshman year in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;college, and likes to play video games and read science fiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is the probability that John is a computer science major- greater than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;50% or less than 50%?
</em><br>
<p>I would think that this question /requires/ certain knowledge about course 
<br>
options.  If (the college) or (most colleges) only allow students to take 
<br>
computer science classes if they are enrolled in a computer science major, 
<br>
this dramatically increases John's chances of being a CompSci major.
<br>
<p>Imagine if the question were about  Jurisprudence of Court Procedure 
<br>
class... it would almost guarantee the student was studying law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ANSWERS:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1:a.70, b.30 ,2:smaller , 3: c, 4: 50/50 bet, 5:less than , 6: Bill, 7:poor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or moderate , 8:a , 9:less than , 10:B
