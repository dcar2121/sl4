<p>
Phillip,
<br>
<p>I deny this thread's subject, the contention that physical pain is bad. 
<br>
Humans frequently (but not always) dislike physical pain, it is true, and 
<br>
often try to avoid it. However most intelligent humans, both today and in 
<br>
the past, have considered physical pain to be neither bad nor good in and of 
<br>
itself.  The situational context surrounding the experience of pain must 
<br>
always be taken into account before one can make a moral judgment about the 
<br>
goodness or badness of it.  I take it as a given that moral judgments are, 
<br>
and must be made by humans, as to cede moral decisions to the capabilities 
<br>
(real or imagined) of other species would be to fail in our moral 
<br>
responsibility as the species with overwhelming power on this planet.
<br>
<p>In regards to your implication that physical pain should be eliminated from 
<br>
earth's biosphere for certain species (mammals?), I strongly doubt that you 
<br>
will find much support for this idea.  The value humans place on preserving 
<br>
Earth's ecosystems intact is currently quite high, and continues to rise 
<br>
with our increasing awareness of our destructive effects on various 
<br>
ecosystems and the need for a healthy biosphere in order to survive.  There 
<br>
is also the considerations of preserving ecosystems for future study (with 
<br>
better technology), for future generations, and as simple resources should 
<br>
we experience societal collapse.  There is nothing to gain from the 
<br>
anthropomorphic extension of human morality toward controlling the day to 
<br>
day life experience of wild animals, neither for the animals nor for 
<br>
ourselves.  The suffering of wild animals is not a problem that requires a 
<br>
solution.  The obliteration of ecosystems along with the attendant loss of 
<br>
knowledge, of biodiversity, and of the beauty we see in them *is* a real and 
<br>
pressing problem.  The Singularity could resolve this through making 
<br>
preservation much easier by resolving many of the human issues that lead to 
<br>
ecosystem destruction, and giving us ready alternatives to that destruction.
<br>

<br>
<p><p>Gazelles are mammals.  They experience physical pain and fear similiar to 
<br>
the way we humans do.  If we can substitute fake gazelles with printed 
<br>
tissues and carbon composite skeletons for the hunting pleasure of lions, we 
<br>
should.  You might have some basis if you were defending a spider's right to 
<br>
be eaten while mating or while giving birth, but we are talking mammals 
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must we preserve eco-systems in which mammals suffer if a (cheap) 
<br>
solution can be found in which the same population of animals don't suffer? 
<br>
Why must we preserve economic systems where people suffer?  The common-sense 
<br>
I speak of is the very simple fact that physical pain is bad.  Are you 
<br>
seriously questioning this?  It sounds to me like you are suggesting 
<br>
evolution-of-predator-species is a superior moral guide to follow than is 
<br>
utilitarianism.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many resources we will have to artificially restrict 
<br>
post-singularity (so there won't be any &quot;eco-systems&quot; to speak of for these 
<br>
resources).  We can't have people making UFAI, time-machines, anti-matter 
<br>
bombs, MNT, screwing with the vacuum state of the local universe, etc.  If 
<br>
some energy resources of the future are deemed similarly untouchable because 
<br>
we may need them to harness even greater energy resources, we will retrict 
<br>
them too.

</em><br>
<p>I don't think we &quot;should&quot;, but we know that &quot;we&quot; will, because that is
<br>
how ecosystems work. SOMEBODY is going to use those resources.
<br>
Resources are never left lying around unused for long. I have been
<br>
trying to explain this to transhumanists for 15 years now. Why is
<br>
this so hard for transhumanists in particular to accept? I suppose
<br>
because they are infected with extropian memes that preach the joy of
<br>
expansion unsullied by any problems with conflicts or resource
<br>
contentions.
<br>
&lt;SNIP&gt;
<br>
&quot;Common-sense&quot; is different for humans than for lions. That is the problem.
