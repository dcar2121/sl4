</em><br>
<em>&gt; into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence.  When it comes to be within humanity's power to end evolution

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth, should we in fact do so?  Should we put an end to the process that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced us?
</em><br>
<p><p>Biological evolution is becoming irrelevant to the human organism and its
<br>
societies.  Our choices with respect to the quality of life of others will
<br>
continue to be based on *our* values, subject to our instrumental power, and
<br>
perceived as moral to the extent that they are seen to promote increasingly
<br>
shared (because they work) values over increasing scope.
<br>
<p>The &quot;process that produced us&quot; is broader and more fundamental than
<br>
biological evolution by natural selection.  For example, in the present era
<br>
we are increasingly defined by our interactions with others and with our
<br>
technology, and the process of change continues to accelerate through us;
<br>
its drivers are more fundamental than we could even imagine we could
<br>
control.
<br>
<p>Unless one were to choose isolation, which would offer only a limited
<br>
respite, the only moral attitude (that which furthers one's values) is to
<br>
head the Red Queen's words and run as fast as possible toward uncertain
<br>
stability within a co-evolutionary environment.
<br>
<p><p>My current best judgment is to answer: no.  Or perhaps, hell no!  Some of my
<br>
<em>&gt; arguments are laid out earlier in this thread, but additionally, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something I find bothersome about the possibility of humanity imposing its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will universally on every other living thing.  It appears a short-sighted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action, something a child might do, or an obsessive.  I think we are smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to leave our options more open.  In fact, that is a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what SIAI is about - opening options and keeping them open.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You touched on the essence of the moral question, which is the question of
<br>
how to &quot;impose our will&quot; (promote our values into the future) but to do so
<br>
with the broadest possible appreciation of the consequences.  Knowing that
<br>
we can never achieve such a god's-eye view, we must apply our
<br>
ever-increasing (objective) knowledge of how the world appears to work, in
<br>
the service of an increasingly broad view of our (subjective) values, to
<br>
develop principles of effective action which for all intents and purposes
<br>
represent our evolving morality.
<br>
<p>This approach to morality encompasses other moral compasses.  [Can I get
<br>
away with that phrase?]  For example, instinctual indicators shared with
<br>
other mammals such as feelings of disgust, pride and love.  It encompasses
<br>
cultural frameworks of morality including religious and philosophical codes
<br>
of conduct and social reciprocity.  It will also encompass the social
<br>
interactions of machine intelligence, with no concern for substrate, but
<br>
only for those shared values that appear to work over increasing scope
<br>
within a competitive environment.
