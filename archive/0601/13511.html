Well, I'll just give my opinion:
<br>
<p>You may have noticed lately that we received some strong support from Peter 
<br>
Thiel, formerly of Paypal. Think of this as a successful mini version of your 
<br>
Google partnership dream. We achieved a partnership with a &quot;dot-com'er&quot;.
<br>
<p>The main reason we were able to get to this point, aside from the quality of our 
<br>
actual ideas / writings on our site, is from networking and working to spread 
<br>
those ideas. And a key part of that was the staff's ability to move to the Palo 
<br>
Alto area last year after the last successful challenge fundraiser. Without 
<br>
succeeding in the last fundraiser we wouldn't be at this point today.
<br>
<p>If we complete the current challenge, then that may lead to further 
<br>
opportunities to keep growing SIAI in a similar way to how the last fundraiser 
<br>
opened up possibilities. And who knows, maybe if that were to continue for a few 
<br>
years there might be a chance to interact with Google or some other large org, 
<br>
if all the pieces were right and it made sense.
<br>
<p>But we have to continue getting larger first, and your $200 (doubled to $400 in 
<br>
the current challenge) will absolutely help, just as the donations in the 
<br>
previous challenges got SIAI to this point.
<br>
<p>P.S. Keep in mind all this recent Google AGI speculation has been purely coming 
<br>
from the article writers and pundits, not from Google execs. I think it's 
<br>
wishful thinking at this point, completely generated from zero real info.
