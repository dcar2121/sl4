Hi all,
<br>
<p>This discussion of the shortcomings of the mailing list format leads
<br>
me to bring up the point that there IS a better discussion format out
<br>
there, which is the forum.
<br>
<p>Mailing lists do not lend themselves to consistently high-quality
<br>
discussion.  I think SL4 is a great list as lists go, but that's
<br>
because the *best* discussions on SL4 have been really good -- even
<br>
though the average discussion is quite uninteresting and repetitive
<br>
from the list old-timer's perspective.
<br>
<p>As has been pointed out, SingInst has a little-used forum site.
<br>
<p>AGIRI (AGI Research Institute) also has a new forum site, which we
<br>
just put up last month, and which has gotten very little usage yet:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.agiri.org/forum/index.php?showforum=10">http://www.agiri.org/forum/index.php?showforum=10</a>
<br>
<p>I would like to invite all list members to sign up for the AGI Forum
<br>
and carry out high-quality discussions of AI and Singularity related
<br>
topics there.  I'm not suggesting that forums should necessarily
<br>
replace mailing list discussion, but at very least I think they can be
<br>
a very appealing alternative/augmentation.
<br>
<p>I admit that using a forum is slightly more of a pain than using a
<br>
mailing list.  However, forums are more easily searchable, they're
<br>
editable after the fact, and they are more cleanly organizable by
<br>
topic.  Overall my view is that they support a higher level of
<br>
discussion.  For instance, the forums at the imminst.org website have
<br>
definitely supported a more consistently high level of content than
<br>
that on the SL4 list.
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; So SL4 is no longer the lean, fresh list that it once was. There was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never any reason to think that it could stay new forever. The SL4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; idea-space is no longer virgin territory. The main avenues have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; surveyed out. The old-growth forests have been thinned. The tavern by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the pier has already burned to the ground twice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Does this mean it's time to redefine the posting guidelines, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in regards to reading! the archives? I leave that to the owner to decide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I was countermanded a while back when I tried to kill a thread about AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Jail. It was an official &quot;dead horse&quot; topic, so I thought it was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no-brainer. But Eliezer felt that, as a highly relevant topic, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deserved continued debate, so long as people could maintain quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; standards in the process. Is this possible without tracking back and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; forth over older ground on occasion? Probably not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, I've been hesitant to snipe on-topic threads sustained by people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communicate reasonably well and have something to say, even when I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that, somewhere in the archives, the points have been made before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That said, the archives do exist. If I were a relative newcomer to SL4,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I wouldn't try to read them from end to end, but I would definitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; search for specific topics I was interested in discussing, if only to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; avoid embarassing myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; With this in mind, another good ! question to ask yourself before posting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is, &quot;will this comment be 'signal' or 'noise' to people going through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the archives?&quot; This is subtly different from the question of whether a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; posting will be relevant in the here and now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not going to kill a thread about list moderation, for obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasons... but let's at least tag it as the META discussion it is, lest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we muddy up the archives even more.
