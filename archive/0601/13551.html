<p>You missed the point.  A corporation can own stock in corporations 
<br>
including itself.  The corporation can own anything including hardware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Generally only humans, and other business entities can legally own shares 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AFAIK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, I don't think a hardware/software system could legally be appointed 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The point of the post I was responding too was how to provide rights for 
<br>
AIs.  This is a route, a &quot;legal fiction&quot; if you will that could be 
<br>
exploited to generate &quot;legal persons&quot; who would have rights within the 
<br>
scope of existing legal frameworks.
<br>
<p>If Eliezer is right about the speed with which a seed AI goes way beyond 
<br>
humans, the problem will be humans keeping any rights at all rather than 
<br>
figuring out how AIs of human level or above should be treated at law.
<br>
<p>_Pirates_ pg 135.

<p>&quot;Yes, Admiral,&quot; said Cantrell. &quot;It's time to put the wagons in a circle.&quot;
<br>
<p>The computer saluted and turned itself off.
<br>
<p>&quot;A question, please,&quot; Vong said. &quot;I gather from talking with Captain Tower 
<br>
that the admiral-Corporate Susan, if you prefer-was responsible for the 
<br>
operation freeing the Madame G. Y. Fox. Despite its tactical brilliance, 
<br>
the maneuver has put you into a serious bind with Japan, and yet you have 
<br>
not taken any punitive action. Why?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What can you do to a computer?&quot; Cantrell asked. He took a sip of coffee. 
<br>
&quot;Besides, I don't have anyone else for the job.&quot; He finished his coffee and 
<br>
put the cup down on the napkin. &quot;Maybe Corporate Susan will learn from the 
<br>
mistake-which wasn't your run-of-the-mill thumb-fingered idiocy, by any 
<br>
means. I guess it comes down to loyalty. I pick the best people I can find 
<br>
and back them.&quot;
