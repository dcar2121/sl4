<p>Here's a fairly recent summary by a physics Nobel laureate and a 
<br>
professional statistician:
<br>
<p><a href="http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~utts/azpsi.html">http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~utts/azpsi.html</a>
<br>
<p>&lt; Strong statistical results are of course meaningless if experiments are 
<br>
not properly conducted. Debunkers of parapsychology are fond of showcasing 
<br>
the very few experiments that have been found to have serious problems. But 
<br>
that ignores the fact that the vast majority of experiments were done using 
<br>
excellent protocols, paying close attention to potential subtle cues, using 
<br>
well-tested randomisation devices and so on. For the past decade the U.S. 
<br>
government experiments were overseen by a very high-level scientific 
<br>
committee, consisting of respected academics from a variety of disciplines, 
<br>
all of whom were required to critique and approve the protocols in advance. 
<br>
There have been no explanations forthcoming that allow an honest observer 
<br>
to dismiss the growing collection of consistent results. &gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When paraphysiologists test a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;professional physic they ALWAYS get a much stronger psi response when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they adopt a carefree attitude toward experimental controls. Gee, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonder why?
</em><br>
<p>Untrue. The key finding from recent work is that the more scrupulous and 
<br>
rigorous the controls, the more robust the results (within the limits of 
<br>
what is feasible for a low-power phenomenon). John can you please provide 
<br>
references to support your assertion?
<br>
<p>To emphasize my earlier remarks about small effect sizes and implications 
<br>
for replication, here's a segment from the same paper:
<br>
<p>&lt; But, as anyone with a training in statistics knows, even where an 
<br>
influence exists, an isolated experiment with an insufficient number of 
<br>
trials may not demonstrate a statistically significant effect. Accordingly, 
<br>
without a more sophisticated analysis, &quot;failure to reproduce an effect&quot; 
<br>
does not demonstrate its absence. Suppose, for example, psychic abilities, 
<br>
in line with the results already described, increase the chances of a 
<br>
successful match from 1/4 to 1/3. Then (according to the accepted 
<br>
statistical theories), an experiment with 30 trials, which has been typical 
<br>
of these experiments, would have less than a 17% chance of achieving a 
<br>
result of statistical significance. The more recent larger experiments 
<br>
still utilise only about 100 trials, and have only about a 57% chance of 
<br>
achieving statistical significance.
<br>
<p>Detailed analysis of the complete collection of experiments on this type of 
<br>
phenomenon shows that what holds, despite changes in equipment, 
<br>
experimenter, subjects, judges, targets and laboratories, is far greater 
<br>
consistency with the 1 in 3 success rate already mentioned than with the 1 
<br>
in 4 chance expectation rate. Such consistency is the hallmark of a genuine 
<br>
effect, and this, together with the very low probability of the overall 
<br>
success rate observed occurring by chance, argues strongly for the 
<br>
phenomena being real and not artifactual.
<br>
<p>Reexamination of other types of psychical investigations reveals that they 
<br>
too achieved replicable effects, which went largely unappreciated because 
<br>
of a poor understanding of statistics. For instance, an analysis of 
<br>
experiments in precognitive card guessing and related &quot;forced-choice&quot; 
<br>
experiments, published by Honorton and Ferrari in the Journal of 
<br>
Parapsychology, found that gifted subjects were able to achieve 
<br>
consistently about a 27% success rate when 25% was expected by chance. 
<br>
Similar U.S. government experiments have been revealed to have achieved the 
<br>
same 27% success rate over thousands of trials. If chance alone were the 
<br>
explanation for these results, it would be truly remarkable to achieve a 
<br>
27% success rate over thousands of trials, and it would be even more 
<br>
remarkable to see identical results in the government work. For further 
<br>
details about the recent evidence, including both a favourable and a 
<br>
skeptical assessment of the U.S. government experiments, consult the 
<br>
Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 10(1), or 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www-stat.ucdavis.edu/users/utts/">http://www-stat.ucdavis.edu/users/utts/</a>&gt;<a href="http://www-stat.ucdavis.edu/users/utts/">http://www-stat.ucdavis.edu/users/utts/</a> 
<br>
on the Internet. &gt;
<br>
<p>What's going on here, I think, is revealed in John's caustic but mis-aimed 
<br>
comments about
<br>
<p>&quot;a waitress with an eight?s grade education in Duluth Minnesota ... my 
<br>
ghostly spirit guide Mohammad Dun told me spoke to me about it in a dream.&quot;
<br>
<p>and so on. This is absolutely irrelevant to the claims of scientists 
<br>
working on parapsychology. Yes, such folk beliefs surely created the 
<br>
initial background interest, a century ago, in apparently paranormal 
<br>
phenomena, and is still used by confidence tricksters to bilk idiots. So 
<br>
what? Forget about them. Talk about the real experiments. Utts and others 
<br>
cite plenty of published papers. Jeering at someone else entirely do not 
<br>
advance your argument one whit; in fact, it makes it look as if you're 
<br>
evading the issue.
