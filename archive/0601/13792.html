Mike Dougherty said &gt;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I am curious to know if the author of the &quot;Becoming a
</em><br>
Seed AI
<br>
Programmer&lt;<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/action/seed-ai-programmer.html">http://www.intelligence.org/action/seed-ai-programmer.html</a>&gt;
<br>
&quot; would consider an actual test for what it takes to
<br>
be a friendly AI developer. If one were to pass the
<br>
test, they would be admitted to the resource pool and
<br>
given responsibility/involvement according to
<br>
demonstrated 
<br>
talent and understanding. This same test would then be
<br>
used to test the evolved/created AGI. When the AGI is
<br>
able to pass the test to become a friendly AI
<br>
developer, then I would argue that it should be given
<br>
equal status as any other &quot;new guy&quot; on the team. If
<br>
this doesn't prove consciousness or self awareness or
<br>
intelligence or whatever you (anyone) want to measure,
<br>
then I doubt there is any sufficient test that can
<br>
satisfy as 'proof.' 
<br>
<p><p>When constructing my 'Singularitarian Directory' of
<br>
the top-100 links I judged to be needed for a seed-AI
<br>
developed:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.agiri.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=108">http://www.agiri.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=108</a>
<br>
<p>I found that the needed info neatly divided into 4
<br>
main subject areas, each of which was further
<br>
sub-divided into 5 areas, for a total of 20 subjects
<br>
needed for a seed-AI developer.  Here are the subject
<br>
areas:
<br>
<p>*Reality Theory
<br>
<p>(1) Anthropic Reasoning
<br>
(2) Cosmology/Relativity
<br>
(3) Quantum Mechanics
<br>
(4) Metaphysics (philosophy)
<br>
(5) String/M-Theory
<br>
<p>Cognitive Science
<br>
<p>(6) Decision/Game theory
<br>
(7) Consciousness studies
<br>
(8) Neurobiology
<br>
(9) Cognitive architectures (AI etc)
<br>
(10) Psychology (inc evolutionary psychology)
<br>
<p>Mathematics
<br>
<p>(11) Information Theory (inc algorithmic design and
<br>
complexity)
<br>
(12) Bayesian Probability Theory
<br>
(13) Foundations (inc Set theory, logic)
<br>
(14) Complex Systems Theory
<br>
(15) Number Theory
<br>
<p>Info Tech
<br>
<p>(16) Networks (inc Security, Internet)
<br>
(17) Hardware (inc parallel, super-computing)
<br>
(18) Databases
<br>
(19) Programming
<br>
(20) Operating Systems
<br>
<p><p>Now, the IQ threshold for getting a phd is deemed to
<br>
be around 125, and it usually takes a total of 5 years
<br>
full-time study to bring someone up to phd level
<br>
knowledge in a given specialty areas.  Since there are
<br>
20 specialist subjects needed and each takes 5 years
<br>
of full-time study to bring someone up to phd level
<br>
knowledge, the conclusion is that it would take ONE
<br>
HUNDRED YEARS (100 years) of full-time study for a
<br>
single human to be competent to be a seed-AI developer.
<br>
<p>&quot;Till shade is gone, till water is gone, into the shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder’s eye on the last day”
