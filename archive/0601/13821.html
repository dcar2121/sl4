<p><em>&gt; But the explanation as to *why* this system of mathematics

</em><br>
<p>The explanation for why and how math exists is the province of philosophy, not
<br>
mathematics. So it would be a 'brute fact' in the sense that math would have no
<br>
explanation for it. But that's not the same thing as saying that no explanation
<br>
existed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now this to me seems to run contrary to the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method, which by its very nature assumes that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no unexplained supernatural brute facts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.  And mathematics itself is a part of reality.
</em><br>
<p>This is controversial. Platonists such as Godel do not think that math is part
<br>
of reality, and thus that science need not explain mathematics. So we do not
<br>
have the endless tower of turtles you refer to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now if, however, we adopt my superficially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'unappealing' suggestion that reality as a whole is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent
</em><br>
<p>What on earth does that mean? Are you saying that there are two facts of
<br>
reality in contradiction with each other? It sure sounds like it. If so, I can
<br>
show that everthing you say is wrong via an elementary exercise in logic. 
<br>
<p>Marc, I'm trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here, but you aren't
<br>
helping me. If you claim that math is a part of reality, and that some true
<br>
theories are inconsistent with one another, then you are saying that there are
<br>
inconsistent facts in reality, right? It's not just the beer talking? Doesn't
<br>
this mean that by the principle of explosion, everything is simultaneously
<br>
true and false and everything I know is wrong, but also right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the situation changes.  There would then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be several different over-lapping formal systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to fully describe reality.  *And each formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system could be used to provide an explanation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others*  Thus mathematics could 'explain itself' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there need be no endless unexplained tower of Godelian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turtles.  So you see, my suggestion is not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unappealing after all.
</em><br>
<p>I don't find an explanation like &quot;'Why A?' 'Because B.' 'Why B?' 'Because A.'&quot;
<br>
appealing, and I don't see why what you're suggesting is different, except
<br>
for maybe having more variables. 
<br>
<p>Daniel
