<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A discussion with its pair, that was not identified, according to police sources, would have gatillado the fatal decision of a specialistic scientist in the development of the artificial intelligence, the computer science sicólogo and Canadian Christopher McKinstry (38).

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sources of office of the public prosecutor indicated that the body of the professional was found at noon of yesterday - in its department of the street Favor 250 -, after that the person who does the cleanliness in the place smelled a strong scent to gas, reason why called to Customs officers. When entering the house, the uniformed ones found the body of McKinstry thrown in the ground of the kitchen.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the published thing in the Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McKinstry">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McKinstry</a>), McKinstry was born the 12 of February of 1967 in Winnipeg, Canada, and would have been operator of telescope VLT, in Paranal hill, that depends on the Austral European Observatory. He appears mentioned like an investigator in artificial intelligence and founding of the Mindpixel project, that finished the last month. He was known by his outlandish sayings on technology.

Semblanza biographical in Wikipedia even mentions both postings appeared in the Web respect to its intentions of suicide in www.mindpixel.com/chris. The last one said: &quot;Why I am writing this? Only with registry intentions, to demonstrate that I am here and more ahead than all you. Time to start off.&quot;
