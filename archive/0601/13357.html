<p>
All,
<br>
<p>The following three remarks are designed to step back and offer a little 
<br>
perspective on the recent debate.
<br>
<p>1) The way that skeptics use the word &quot;parapsychology,&quot; and the way that 
<br>
parapsycholgists use it, can sometimes be so different that 90% of any 
<br>
dispute between the two can depend on this misunderstanding.
<br>
<p>What you have to understand is that there is an *enormous* lunatic 
<br>
fringe (the TV psychics, astrologists, fakers, etc) hanging around the 
<br>
edges of parapsychology, but they have almost nothing to do with the 
<br>
core science whatsoever.  To outsiders, this distinction is often lost, 
<br>
but it is tremendously, overwhelmingly important.
<br>
<p>To understand the depth of it, imagine that someone criticised a modern 
<br>
day chemistry researcher as an &quot;alchemist&quot;.  Imagine that the critic 
<br>
hurled insults at this chemist, accusing them of dabbling in black arts, 
<br>
trying to transmute lead into gold, sacrificing chickens in obscure 
<br>
cabbalistic rituals and hoodwinking gullible people into funding their 
<br>
research in the hope that they would become rich or divine the secret of 
<br>
eternal life.  Imagine a critic who sincerely believed that chemistry 
<br>
and old-fashioned pre-biblical alchemy were exactly the same thing.
<br>
<p>I know it is difficult to separate the lunatic fringe from the core 
<br>
science in the case of parapsychology, but it is important to try.
<br>
<p>2) There are some people who say that experimenter fraud is a sufficient 
<br>
explanation for *all* parapsychological data.  In other words, it does 
<br>
not matter how well the science is done, these people will reject it 
<br>
using the simple explanation that the scientist who did the work is an 
<br>
outright liar and cheat.  This explanation can be applied to all the 
<br>
data, without exception.
<br>
<p>It only takes a moment's thought to realise that even if paranormal 
<br>
phenomena are real and completely valid, there is nothing that could 
<br>
possibly shake a person who takes this attitude.  If a person takes a 
<br>
point of view on a subject that is completely immune to any empirical 
<br>
data, then this person is not a scientist:  this is a complete 
<br>
abnegation of the most basic standards of scientific research.  This is 
<br>
a regression to the Dark Ages.
<br>
<p>Sadly, this attitude is extremely widespread.  It is used, quite 
<br>
shamelessly, to attack and condemn parapsycholgists.  There are serious 
<br>
and honest scientists who live in constant fear of being witch-hunted 
<br>
out of their jobs by other academics who adopt this attitude, and who 
<br>
use every means at their disposal (including sabotage) to try to stop 
<br>
this kind of science from being published in mainstream journals.
<br>
<p>So when people try to understand why it is that paranormal phenomena 
<br>
have not been accepted by mainstream science, they have to bear in mind 
<br>
that science is not a logical process, it is more of a social process, 
<br>
subject to the whims of real people who have beliefs, preconceptions and 
<br>
biasses.  One of those biasses is this attitude I have just described, 
<br>
and so long as it exists it will be perfectly capable of shutting out 
<br>
perfectly valid experimental data and making it appear that there are no 
<br>
such data in existence.  If you look at the history of science you will 
<br>
see that this has always been so (I refer, once again, to the treatment 
<br>
afforded Wegener), but it is sad that some people argue as if Science 
<br>
had no subjective, social component in it whatsoever.
<br>
<p>3) On the question of using psi to win the lottery, thus proving 
<br>
conclusively that it is valid.
<br>
<p>Consider, as a hypothetical, the possibility that the phenomenon *does* 
<br>
exist:  suppose that human minds sometimes try to guess the outcome of a 
<br>
process that they cannot possibly know (according to the normal laws of 
<br>
physics), and that their guesses differ signifcantly from what they 
<br>
should have gotten by chance.
<br>
<p>Now, if psi were valid, it would mean there was some kind of connection 
<br>
between the &quot;thoughts&quot; or &quot;intentions&quot; or &quot;desires&quot; of an individual and 
<br>
the outside world.  But wait:  thinking is an extremely complex process, 
<br>
with many layers to it.  We know that there is a lot of stuff going on a 
<br>
human mind, many layers of wishing and wanting and thinking, so it makes 
<br>
sense to ask which *part* of this complex process is connected to the 
<br>
world?  Could it possibly depend on things like the level of interest of 
<br>
the subject?  Their motivation?  Their belief system (whether they 
<br>
accept that esp is possible or whether they find the idea repugnant)? 
<br>
Could it be that unconscious thoughts are involved?
<br>
<p>In other words, if you get as far as second base, it turns out that 
<br>
there are many, many other factors that might affect the way the 
<br>
phenomena occur.  One of the most important of those is the possibility 
<br>
that &quot;freshness&quot; or &quot;spontaneity&quot; or &quot;lability&quot; of the thought processes 
<br>
are quite important for getting an effect.  In fact, there is some 
<br>
empirical evidence that relaxation and a carefree attitude are a 
<br>
necessary condition for the effect to occur.
<br>
<p>And the most frustrating part of this is that the mental state of the 
<br>
*experimenter* would also be expected to play a role in the outcome of 
<br>
any experiment.  Is this not too be expected?  After all, if the 
<br>
thoughts of the subject can cause an experiment to work, why would there 
<br>
be any reason to believe that the thoughts of the experimenter would 
<br>
*not* also play a role?  We simply have no pretheoretical reason to 
<br>
assert that just because the poor experimenter *wants* to be objective 
<br>
and independent of what the subject is doing, that therefore the *will* 
<br>
be so detached.  The very nature of the phenomena dictate that 
<br>
accidental experimenter effects are probably going to happen!
<br>
<p>So here is a problem.  You ask for a repeatable result, and say that IF 
<br>
the effect exists, THEN it MUST be possible to go straight out and 
<br>
harness it to compound some results and win the lottery.  That inference 
<br>
is simply not valid:  the nature of the phenomena is such that it could 
<br>
easily be sensitive to the anxieties and subconscious wishes of those 
<br>
involved in an experiment, and the high-stakes nature of a money-making 
<br>
psi experiment (with all the anticipation and commitment to a positive 
<br>
result) would seem to indicate that the experimenter and others might 
<br>
have an effect on the appearance of the effect.
<br>
<p>And since we have suspected for a long time, from other results, that 
<br>
the more a person strives to get the effect to work, and the more they 
<br>
care about the result, the less it manifests itself, we would in that 
<br>
case tentatively predict that lottery winning experiments would be 
<br>
extremely difficult, not straightforward.
<br>
<p>This is not to say the effect will always be impossible, just that it is 
<br>
completely invalid to suggest that BECAUSE parapsychologists cannot 
<br>
produce a lottery application, THEREFORE the existence of paranormal 
<br>
phenomena is suspect.  Isn't there some kind of 2500-year-old rule of 
<br>
logical reasoning that says that if A implies B you cannot deduce that 
<br>
not-B implies not-A?
<br>
<p>I have actually taken part in an experiment to do this.  A colleague of 
<br>
mine collected a huge quantity of experimental data, from dozens of 
<br>
subjects, over a period of several months (using the same experimental 
<br>
design that I mentioned I used, earlier).  He, one other person and I 
<br>
then went to a casino with fifty pounds sterling (a lot of money for a 
<br>
penniless student to invest in an experiment, I can assure you) and then 
<br>
used the distilled essence of all the collected data to bet on a 
<br>
roulette wheel.  That was all we did in the casino, mind:  walk in with 
<br>
the money, go straight to the roulette wheel and make the bet using the 
<br>
numbers he had written down.  It took just a few seconds for the wheel 
<br>
to turn and the money to get flushed into the croupier's stash.  Months 
<br>
of effort, hundreds of hours of tediously collecting data, and all gone 
<br>
in a couple of seconds.
<br>
<p><p><p>I really do hope that with these meditations we can put the discussion 
<br>
to bed.  I stopped doing this kind of research a long time ago, and I 
<br>
personally want to concentrate all my energies this year on positive 
<br>
efforts to promote AGI and singularity research.
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.
