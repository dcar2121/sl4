<em>&gt; Michael, you are arguing that an animal's physical

</em><br>
<p>Err... no.  To clarify, I do not justify the physical suffering of wild 
<br>
animals because it doesn't require justification.  It would require 
<br>
justification if humans were responsible for causing it, or perhaps if we 
<br>
had a very large amount of control over the situation and had a viable 
<br>
alternative.  Post singularity our control may be very high, but I currently 
<br>
cannot imagine a viable alternative to physical suffering that when 
<br>
implemented across an ecosystem leaves it intact.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What is wrong with using holographic techniques and

<em>&gt; (holographic) lion?
</em><br>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, if you're into that sort of thing.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your trick below is to suggest that since animals do

</em><br>
<p>No, that wasn't my suggestion.  Most, if not all living creatures have 
<br>
decision making capabilities and preferences.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What were your other reasons for keeping ecosystems
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's a neat idea :)  But you are parodying my position.  I suggested that 
<br>
intact *ecosystems* may act as a resource for *humans* if our technological 
<br>
society fails.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think you also suggested we might lose info if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cease ecosystems in their natural form.  Umm, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; info will we lose?
</em><br>
<p>We have much to learn about natural ecosystems.  Come on, Phillip, you must 
<br>
know that already.  Ecosystems aren't just lumps of inert matter, they are a 
<br>
vast sets of evolving processes that are highly unpredictable.  There is no 
<br>
way we can learn all there is to learn from an ecosystem from a short 
<br>
observation - or even a long one.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There was a very famous philospher who kicked his dog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around obsessively.  He couldn't believe the dog acted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as if it experienced pain.  He didn't believe his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cherished god had instilled the experience of pain in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals.
</em><br>
<p>There is the possibility, however faint, that he was simply acting 
<br>
consistently with his beliefs... but I think he was just an asshole, and a 
<br>
cruel one at that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Physical pain is bad.  Physical pleasure is good.
</em><br>
<p>Saying it doesn't make it so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Everything in the universe is derivative of these two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms.
</em><br>
<p>Not in the universe I am inhabiting.  But, for the sake of argument, let me 
<br>
take your axioms as true for a moment... if you eliminate physical 
<br>
suffering, wouldn't you eliminate half of everything in the universe?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Every societal construct of worth and every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological brain-state reduces to pain/pleasure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is not a single exception.
</em><br>
<p>Care to give us some examples of &quot;societal constructs of worth&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;brain-states&quot; and how they &quot;reduce&quot; to pain or pleasure?
