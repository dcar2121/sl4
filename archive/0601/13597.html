</em><br>
<p>I can't speak for Searle himself.  Searle has said some pretty stupid 
<br>
things, but he's had some gems, too.
<br>
<p>BUT
<br>
<p>Rephrasing your statement a little:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Searle's Chinese room is not a reductio ad absurdum of semantics-free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emulation.  This is proven because, when presented with a situation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which the Chinese room is embedded within a robot body just like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human's, responding directly to sensory stimuli, { one can say } it STILL 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;says it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has no consciousness
</em><br>
<p>NO.
<br>
<p>We can't say it has no Consciousness.
<br>
<p>But, we STILL can't prove that it DOES have Consciousness.
<br>
<p>With any entity,
<br>
<p>Just because &quot;it&quot; appears to behave in a manner that indicates 
<br>
consciousness, there is no guarantee
<br>
that &quot;it&quot; has Consciousness.
<br>
<p>In a way, Searle's Chinese Room Example is just a semi-plausible example of 
<br>
an entity behaving as if it had a Conscious understanding, when no such 
<br>
Conscious understanding exists.
<br>
<p>Some people have a tendency to project consciousness onto some entities - 
<br>
soft toys, computers, AIBOs, plants, the French... often the projection is 
<br>
more relevant to how they feel about the object than whether it displays 
<br>
evidence of intelligent behaviour.  Even some apparently intelligent 
<br>
behaviour is caused by unintelligent mechanisms (&quot;wow - look at those 
<br>
changing clouds in the sky!&quot;)
<br>
<p>Searle's /example/  (how many fucking times do we have to make it clear that 
<br>
IT IS NOT A @#%$ing TEST!) is simply showing one type of complicated, 
<br>
apparently intelligent behaviour, that is controlled by an extremely 
<br>
simplest mechanism (IF - THEN) does not require Conscious understanding
<br>
<p>In this way, it is relevant to the Philosophical Zombie argument.  (For 
<br>
background, google &quot;Chalmers philosophical zombies&quot;.  Chalmers' zombie pages 
<br>
are not only informative, they're damn funny)
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Going back to Phil's example of a &quot;black box&quot; put inside a humanoid:
<br>
<p>If the box inside operates on a lookup table, it doesn't match my concept of 
<br>
Consciousness.
<br>
<p>If the box is inside a Madame Tussaud's replica of a human and is 
<br>
&quot;responding directly to sensory stimuli&quot; using an if-then table, it still 
<br>
doesn't match my concept of Consciousness.
<br>
<p>So, how does this &quot;prove&quot; that &quot;Searle's Chinese room is not a reductio ad 
<br>
absurdum of semantics-free emulation. &quot; ?
<br>
<p>I don't think it does.
