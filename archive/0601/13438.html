Maybe psi is real.
<br>
And maybe everything is a simulation or a dream.
<br>
And maybe all of this so called &quot;science&quot; is just Western imperialism and 
<br>
jockeying for power.
<br>
And maybe the history our fnord was a lie and fnord
<br>
Or overwhelming memes are just jerking us around.
<br>
Or this instant is the result of a brain appearing complete with memories in 
<br>
the quantum foam, to cease its existance momentarily.
<br>
Or this email message and its author are the content of a book in Borges 
<br>
library
<br>
or....or....
<br>
<p>but
<br>
<p>It seems to me that that isn't what this site is for.
<br>
It seems to me that shock level four refers to a set of common assumptions 
<br>
and beliefs
<br>
These beliefs basically revolve around taking something like the consensus 
<br>
of modern physics and logic and pushing them to the limit in terms of what 
<br>
they tell us about the effect of certain sorts of information processing.
<br>
<p>Those assumptions may be wrong.
<br>
I don't even know how, as a human, to assign a probability to the 
<br>
possibility that they are wrong.
<br>
But I do know that if they are wrong then &quot;everything I know is wrong&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt;From my perspective, from decision theory for humans purposes, the entire 
</em><br>
huge space of universe states describable as &quot;everything I know is wrong&quot; 
<br>
simply renormalizes out of my decision function.
<br>
It's not worth our talking about it.
<br>
If we're wrong, and psi is real, then we're simply wrong, and useless, and 
<br>
who cares.  The universe is full of futile religions.  I don't mind 
<br>
Christians existing, why should I mind existing as their equivalent, if that 
<br>
is how things are?
<br>
But if we are right, then working from the assumptions of approximately 
<br>
consensus physics and logic is worth doing.
<br>
In which case thinking about psi is not.
