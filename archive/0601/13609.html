<p>This discussion about your claim has become confused:  you can claim (a) 
<br>
that your system is at or above the human level of intelligence, or (b) 
<br>
that it is &quot;conscious&quot;.
<br>
<p>We don't agree on what &quot;consciousness&quot; is, but we DO seem to agree (most 
<br>
of us) that if you simply show that your system is intelligent, that is 
<br>
NOT a proof that it is conscious.
<br>
<p>As several people have pointed out, there is no such thing as a &quot;Searle 
<br>
Test&quot;, and the Turing Test was originally just a thought experiment; it 
<br>
was not supposed to be a test that actually tested for anything.
<br>
<p>What I am interested in is WHETHER YOUR SYSTEM IS INTELLIGENT.  I would 
<br>
like to know if you think it is going to talk (with a voice?) in such a 
<br>
way that it clearly knows what it is talking about.
<br>
<p>To ensure that you don't cheat, I propose the following test.
<br>
<p>I will ask your machine several questions.  These will be designed to 
<br>
stretch it to the limits of its cognitive powers.  The first set of 
<br>
questions I will give you now, so your machine has time to prepare. 
<br>
Others must be answered in real time, and they will be of a similar 
<br>
character as these.
<br>
<p>1) Give an introduction to Heim's theory of quantum gravity, in 
<br>
sufficient detail to allow a Physics graduate to understand it.
<br>
<p>2) You are living in a hovel in northern England some time in the Dark 
<br>
Ages, and when you open your door and look outside one morning, you hear 
<br>
a fragment of a T.S. Eliot poem come to you (suitably translated into 
<br>
your vernacular) through a time warp.  You smile with recognition. 
<br>
Explain why you smiled, what you heard and what the context is.
<br>
<p>3) Might Igor Stravinsky have had any opinion on the subject of motor 
<br>
scooters?  Why?
<br>
<p>When the remaining questions are asked in real time, your machine will 
<br>
be required to respond in any human language that is currently spoken by 
<br>
more than 1 million people.  I will specify which language, but I will 
<br>
give only one second's notice of the language.
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.
