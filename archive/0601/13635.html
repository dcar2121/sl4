Sometimes I have spare time but am too bored or burned out to read the subject material I'm studying.  If there were a mechanism by which I could flag or compile a &quot;best of sl4 archives&quot; (top 10%), and if the flagged parts were later compiled by someone as a newbie intro or something, I would gladly volunteer my time for such an effort.

<p>Mitchell Howe &lt;<a href="mailto:mitch.howe@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Re:%20SL4?">mitch.howe@gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:  So SL4 is no longer the lean, fresh list that it once was. There was 
<br>
never any reason to think that it could stay new forever. The SL4 
<br>
idea-space is no longer virgin territory. The main avenues have been 
<br>
surveyed out. The old-growth forests have been thinned. The tavern by 
<br>
the pier has already burned to the ground twice.
<br>
<p>Does this mean it's time to redefine the posting guidelines, especially 
<br>
in regards to reading the archives? I leave that to the owner to decide.
<br>
<p>I was countermanded a while back when I tried to kill a thread about AI 
<br>
Jail. It was an official &quot;dead horse&quot; topic, so I thought it was a 
<br>
no-brainer. But Eliezer felt that, as a highly relevant topic, it 
<br>
deserved continued debate, so long as people could maintain quality 
<br>
standards in the process. Is this possible without tracking back and 
<br>
forth over older ground on occasion? Probably not.
<br>
<p>So, I've been hesitant to snipe on-topic threads sustained by people who 
<br>
communicate reasonably well and have something to say, even when I know 
<br>
that, somewhere in the archives, the points have been made before.
<br>
<p>That said, the archives do exist. If I were a relative newcomer to SL4, 
<br>
I wouldn't try to read them from end to end, but I would definitely 
<br>
search for specific topics I was interested in discussing, if only to 
<br>
avoid embarassing myself.
<br>
<p>With this in mind, another good question to ask yourself before posting 
<br>
is, &quot;will this comment be 'signal' or 'noise' to people going through 
<br>
the archives?&quot; This is subtly different from the question of whether a 
<br>
posting will be relevant in the here and now.
<br>
<p>I'm not going to kill a thread about list moderation, for obvious 
<br>
reasons... but let's at least tag it as the META discussion it is, lest 
<br>
we muddy up the archives even more.
