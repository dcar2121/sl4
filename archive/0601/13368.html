On Sun, 01 Jan 2006 &quot;Richard Loosemore&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20Attempt%20to%20put%20Paranormal%20discussion%20in%20context">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are some people who say that experimenter fraud is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient explanation for *all* parapsychological data.
</em><br>
<p>I would say that’s far too harsh, I don’t think experimenter fraud
<br>
counts for more than 20%, test subject fraud is about 50%, and juggling
<br>
statistics to fool oneself about 30%.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, it does not matter how well the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science is done, these people will reject it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the simple explanation that the scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who did the work is an outright liar and cheat. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This explanation can be applied to all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data, without exception.
</em><br>
<p>No. Make more money than God predicting the lottery and horse racing and
<br>
the stock market and I am wrong and psi is real. Find Osama bin Laden
<br>
with remote viewing and I am wrong and psi is real. Or just have real
<br>
scientists repeat the pro psi results and have them published in real
<br>
science journals, and have those articles cited positively lots and lots
<br>
of times in other real science journals and I am wrong and psi is real.
<br>
<p>I’ve been frank with you now you be frank with me. What would make you
<br>
say I was wrong and there is nothing to psi? Is there any experimental
<br>
result that would shake your faith? Anything?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In fact, there is some empirical evidence that relaxation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a carefree attitude are a necessary condition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the effect to occur. 
</em><br>
<p>Truer words were never spoken! When paraphysiologists test a
<br>
professional physic they ALWAYS get a much stronger psi response when
<br>
they adopt a carefree attitude toward experimental controls. Gee, I
<br>
wonder why? 
<br>
<p>I always thought it was odd that fortune tellers and such said that for
<br>
psi to work there can’t be any doubters around. It would make more sense
<br>
if the opposite were true, you can  experience true psi only if you
<br>
think psi is one big load of foul-smelling  crap. As soon as you’ve had
<br>
a positive psi experience and start to think psi is real, it goes away. 
<br>
If so I must be Psychic as hell.
