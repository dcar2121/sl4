This is all getting quite exciting if I may say so ;)
<br>
<p>Some new company is again making big claims.  They say
<br>
they've succeeded in creating the world's first true
<br>
AGI , which they call PIBOT, and that they're going to
<br>
unveil PIBOT to the world in a series of press
<br>
conferences starting at the end of this year.  See:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.pibot.com/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=PIBOT+Conference+Series">http://www.pibot.com/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=PIBOT+Conference+Series</a>
<br>
<p>Sounds like a hoax to me.  I've read the stuff on the
<br>
web-site and hey, even I could write something more
<br>
plausible sounding and clever than that ;)  I see no
<br>
evidence they've even got a rudimentary AGI theory. 
<br>
Still, it all adds to the general fun I suppose.

My own top-down theory of metaphysics is finally
completed.  A far more coherent summary piece than
anything I've posted to SL4 can be found here:
<a href="http://www.toequest.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1334">http://www.toequest.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1334</a>
Why did I waste so much time fiddling around with
philosophical hot-air on SL4 you may all ask? (3 years
I've been thinking about it now actually, and 95% of
everything I said was shit).  The answer is my belief
that if you don't get the fundamentals right you're
screwed from the start.  These are, I claim, the
correct fundamentals at long long last.  My theory has
9 'Universal Utilities', which I claim, form the
correct moral invariant that any working AGI has to be
built with - see the 'Table Of Universal Utilities'. 
The ideas as intended only as a very very rough
top-down strategy towards AGI.
Before I hear the inevitable howls and flames about
how useless philosophy is again, let me point out that
a very rough and fuzzy document which is correct (no
matter how crude it reads) 
is better than a million clever 1000-page technical
documents that are wrong ;)
Since my general top-down philosophical strategy is
completed at last, I am now moving to trying my hand
at design.

I've also finished the 'Singularitarian's Internet
Directory', my listing of what I judge to be the
top-100 web-sites relevant to AGI/Singularity stuff
from the perspective of those wanting hard science. 
The directory is divided into 4 main areas:
Reality Theory, Cognitive Science, Mathematics and
Info-Tech.  Here's the link:

&quot;Till shade is gone, till water is gone, into the shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder’s eye on the last day”
