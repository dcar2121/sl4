<br>
<p>It's a mock trial where BINA48, an AI computer, is seeking an injunction to 
<br>
keep itself from being turned off and its parts 
<br>
arbitrarily  rearranged.  If you have not read it, you should.
<br>
<p>The judge was Joseph P. McMenamin, BINA48's attorney was Martine A. 
<br>
Rothblatt, and Marc N. Bernstein (EFF) played the attorney for Exabit 
<br>
Corporation (that had created BINA48).  They were all good, good attorneys 
<br>
are natural actors.  Martine had the lead role and did an exceptional 
<br>
performance defending BINA48.
<br>
<p>As Martine points out elsewhere (in the context of space law) when lawyers 
<br>
start talking about something it is about to happen!
<br>
<p>What the computer was doing (for the contrived script) was answering large 
<br>
numbers of 800 calls (up to 1000?) so well that callers thought they were 
<br>
talking to humans.
<br>
<p>But it's actually a decent basis for a business plan.  Replacing 1000 800 
<br>
number operators would be saving a revenue stream of at least $20,000 an 
<br>
hour. Times 8760 hours/year, that's $175 million, and probably twice that 
<br>
unless they were offshore operators.  The actual saving would be lower by 
<br>
what you had to spend on building, hardware, power, technicians and 
<br>
programmers to keep it in operation, but even $75 million a year cost would 
<br>
give you a profit stream of $100 million a year.  Such a steam would 
<br>
justify spending perhaps $200 million to get it going (on the assumption 
<br>
you knew how to do it).
<br>
<p>But unless you are talking to a singularity transhumanist businessman, you 
<br>
should probably cut the story off before BINA48 gets a lawyer.  :-)
<br>

<br>
<p>PS.
<br>
<p>Google returns blank for BINA48 sl4, so I guess this has not been discussed 
<br>
here before.
