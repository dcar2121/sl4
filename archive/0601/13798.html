Granted.
<br>
<p>But (and this is also directed at CyTG's comments) .....
<br>
<p>1)  If you want to only talk about simulating a brain, there are so many 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;imponderables still left to be resolved (current neural net learning 
<br>
algorithms are not adequate models of what goes on in a real synapse, 
<br>
for example, and we believe there could be substantial computing 
<br>
happening in the relatively timing of pulse arrival out there in the 
<br>
dendritic tree) that the assumptions you've made about the computing 
<br>
required at each neuron could be a few orders of magnitude to small. 
<br>
The uncertainty is so huge that these calculations hardly even count as 
<br>
ballpark estimates, sadly.
<br>
<p>2)  If you believe, as I do, that merely emulating the structure and 
<br>
function of the brain is the wrong way to go (too hard to figure out 
<br>
what the exact computation IS, down at that fine-grained level), then 
<br>
you would say that all such calculations are a waste of time.  I repeat 
<br>
what I said earlier:  if we had all the computational resources to 
<br>
emulate a brain *today* it might still take another 35 years or 95 years 
<br>
to get enough information to be able to do it.
<br>
<p>Instead, take a long hard look at cognitive science and AGI research. 
<br>
Here, we try to understand the functional architecture of minds.  We 
<br>
have a good chance of understanding *what* the functional units actually 
<br>
should do to make a mind work.  Those functional units might be 
<br>
implemented in a brain with ten thousand neurons each, but when I 
<br>
understand what the unit is doing, I might find that I can get away with 
<br>
a code implementation that takes just a small amount of computing, 
<br>
perhaps with no floating point calculations whatsoever!  Faced with that 
<br>
possibility, we might find that we are only a couple of years away from 
<br>
being able to figure the mechanism, and that we already have enough 
<br>
power in a roomful of server blades.
<br>
<p>Now *that* is the exciting part, as far as I am concerned.
