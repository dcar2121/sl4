(Judgment Quotient)
<br>
<p>Judgement Quotient Test 1.0
<br>
<p>-These questions might seem... familiar :)
<br>
--First of all, how well does everyone score, second of all, did I get the 
<br>
answers right? :-p
<br>
<p><p>1. A random sample of 100 professionals was done. Seventy of those 
<br>
interviewed were lawyers, and thirty of those interviewed were engineers. 
<br>
Dick is a 30 year old man. He is married and has no children. A man of high 
<br>
ability and high motivation, he promises to be quite sucesful in his field. 
<br>
He is well liked by his colleagues.
<br>
<p>a.What is the probability that Dick is a lawyer:
<br>
b.What is the probability that Dick is an engineer:
<br>
<p>2. A certain town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital about 
<br>
45 babies are born each day, and in the smaller hospital about 15 babies are 
<br>
born each day. As you know, 50 percent of all babies born are boys. However, 
<br>
the exact percentage may be higher or lower on any given day. For a period 
<br>
of 1 year, each hospital kept a record of how many days more than 60% of the 
<br>
babies born were boys.
<br>
<p>Which hospital recorded more such days?
<br>
The larger hospital, or the smaller hospital, or the same (within 5 percent 
<br>
of each other).
<br>
<p>3. Given a coin is flipped 10 times, which sequence is more likely?
<br>
<p>a. HTTHHTTHTHT
<br>
b. HHHHHHHHHH
<br>
c. same
<br>
<p>4. Given a coin is flipped 10 times
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HHHHHHHHHH
<br>
<p>What would you guess your odds of hitting tails are next round?
<br>
<p><p>5. Suppose there is some student who made A's and B's in 9th and 10th grade, 
<br>
and straight A's in eleventh and twelth grade. Assuming that only 10% of 
<br>
college freshman make straight A's their first
<br>
semester, what would you guess the probability is that this student makes 
<br>
straight A's- greater or less than 50%?
<br>
<p>6. Suppose there are two students, Bill and Bob.
<br>
<p>Bill's first year record: A A C A C A C C
<br>
Bob's first year record: B B B B B B B B
<br>
<p>Suppose you predict, for both Bill and Bob, that their average GPA for their 
<br>
next year in college is a B. For which student are you more confident in 
<br>
your prediction, Bill, Bob, or same?
<br>
<p>7. Suppose there is some pilot in training who is practicing landing 
<br>
procedures. The pilot has had a few poor landings, and a few good landings. 
<br>
He just now completed what his trainer labeled an
<br>
&quot;Excellent performance&quot; on his most recent landing. Predict what his most 
<br>
likely rating will be on his next landing:
<br>
<p>a. Failure
<br>
b. Bad
<br>
c. Poor
<br>
d. Moderate
<br>
e. Good
<br>
f. Excellent
<br>
g. Outstanding
<br>
<p>8. Suppose there is some student John. John is very disorganized, but 
<br>
intelligent. He likes school, but dislikes his teachers, and doesn't have a 
<br>
very active social life. John is good at math, and also good at writing, but 
<br>
speaks poorly.
<br>
<p>Which option is more likely:
<br>
<p>a.John is a varsity lacrosse player.
<br>
b.John is both a lacrosse player and a computer science major.
<br>
<p>9. Suppose that a group of 100 college student were surveyed. 95 of the 
<br>
student were psychology
<br>
majors. 5 of the students were computer science majors. Suppose John is one 
<br>
of the students
<br>
surveyed. Suppose John is a very technical person who enjoys detailed math 
<br>
and is very anti-social.
<br>
Also, suppose John is enrolled in an introductory computer science class in 
<br>
his freshman year in
<br>
college, and likes to play video games and read science fiction.
<br>
<p>What is the probability that John is a computer science major- greater than 
<br>
50% or less than 50%?
<br>
<p>10. The average height of American college men is 175cm. Three files were 
<br>
randomly drawn from a
<br>
college registrar's office: John, Mike, and Bob. Which outcome is more 
<br>
likely with respect to the
<br>
heights of these three men?
<br>
<p>A. John - 178cm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike - 170cm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob - 176 cm
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p>B. John - 177cm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike - 177 cm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob - 177 cm\
<br>
<p><p><p>ANSWERS:
<br>
<p>1:a.70, b.30 ,2:smaller , 3: c, 4: 50/50 bet, 5:less than , 6: Bill, 7:poor 
<br>
or moderate , 8:a , 9:less than , 10:B
