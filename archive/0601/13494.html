<p>Eliezer, I commend you on your pursuasive writing techniques (which I
<br>
was tempted to annotate), and of course you make a valid point about
<br>
the importance, rising to the level of necessity, of striving to
<br>
discover a constructive solution to seemingly unsolvable problems.
<br>
<p>I could support your point using real-life examples such as the
<br>
apparent paradox of the Cold War, or multiple examples from my own
<br>
life where I haven't been able to see a way forward, but survived via
<br>
perseverance and that abstract principle I've tried to communicate to
<br>
you before -- that we're the end result of a long chain of survivors,
<br>
and to a surprising extent we can trust in the environment that lead
<br>
to us being here even when we don't know what's going on.
<br>
<p>But that wasn't the point of my post.  The point was about that &quot;moral
<br>
repugnance&quot;, operating below fully conscious awareness, that people
<br>
experience when faced with difficult decisions of the type where a
<br>
near-term sacrifice is in fact indicated to achieve broader good.
<br>
<p>For the record, I wouldn't agree with a proposal to nuke a population
<br>
under any expected near-term conditions, but I could conceive of
<br>
hypothetical conditions under which that might be the right thing to
<br>
do.  I can certainly entertain the thought and consider classes of
<br>
similar problems and what general approaches might be effective toward
<br>
achieving various goals of varying moral value.
<br>
<p>If this topic of conversation ever evolved to a sustained level of
<br>
intelligent, respectful discussion, I would hope to discuss ways of
<br>
making such decisions rationally, but under constraints of incomplete
<br>
knowledge and time.  We might talk about heuristics and biases before
<br>
moving on, and then I suspect it might become clear that
<br>
decision-making based on informed principles, rather then expected end
<br>
result, is one of the better ways to proceed in such cases.   We might
<br>
even talk about what it means to have principles that are &quot;well
<br>
informed&quot;, and so on...

<p><p><p><p><p><em>&gt; One recalls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elrond, in Tolkien's prehistory to _The Lord of the Rings_, pleading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Isildur to throw the Ring into Mount Doom.  In the movie version we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get to see this (and as far as I know, it's faithful to Tolkien):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elrond and Isildur actually standing at the Crack of Doom, Isildur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holding up the Ring, and then...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elrond:   Throw in the Ring!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Isildur:  Nah.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elrond:   Okay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what should Elrond have done?  Push Isildur screaming into the Crack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Doom?  A fine deed that would have been, to set to the credit of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ring...  So Elrond let Isildur go, resulting in some untold number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; casualties in the War of the Ring a few centuries later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should we blame Elrond for that?  Well, if it was me, I sure would blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself.  Just because I have ethics doesn't mean I'm not responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plus the Ring killed Isildur anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And Isildur was lucky.  He could have ended up as Gollum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elrond had plenty of options besides pushing Isildur into Mount Doom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He could have bopped Isildur on the head and then used his sword to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nudge the Ring off the edge.  Worst case scenario, Elrond bops Isildur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the head, calls in his lieutenants, strips off his own armor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *volunteers* to be pushed into Mount Doom if he can't manage to nudge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the Ring, throw off the Ring, or step off the edge.  If Elrond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasn't willing to sacrifice himself, he was *obligated* to call for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteers, and if that made him feel awful that was *his* problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elrond was so focused on the obvious wrong way to solve the problem that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he didn't see the creative right ways.  His great failure wasn't that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lacked ethics, it was that he didn't know how to use them.  He thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his ethics were supposed to be heroic disadvantages.  If Elrond had just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken for *granted* that he couldn't push Isildur off the edge, instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of agonizing, he would have seen easier and better solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It won't always be that way.  We don't live in so kind a universe.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Elrond it was so, even without Tolkien intending it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did anyone else notice this, when they read the book, or watched the movie?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The theory behind the Singularity Institute is that it's possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *save the entire damn world* without killing people, pointing guns at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, telling people what to do, or any of the usual bullying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribal-chief solutions that instantly pop into people's heads when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider political problems.  That's not idealism, it's intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; History teaches us that the &quot;difficult&quot; choices, the obvious wrong ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to solve the problem, DON'T FRICKIN' WORK.  Stalin broke plenty of eggs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but where are the omelets?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So don't make excuses in advance for ethical failures.  People are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypnotized by &quot;difficult&quot; choices that they don't look *hard* for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creative solution.  They just go straight off and make the &quot;difficult&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice.  Taking the &quot;difficult&quot; option is not difficult, it's easy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convenient.  That's why people spend so much time looking for excuses to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do things the &quot;difficult&quot; way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what's really difficult?  Thinking.  It can be frickin' hard to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a good solution, you've got to, like, actually sit down and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrate.  And sometimes, yes, it's painful and inconvenient - for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *yourself*, not some convenient outside victim who has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sacrificed&quot; - to do things the right way.  It's not always easy.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't make your excuses in advance, or you'll shoot yourself down before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you start.
