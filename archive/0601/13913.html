<p>
a few points, probably worth signficantly less than two cents:
<br>
<p>- coding an AGI will require programmers. As a programmer, newly
<br>
interested in the field (my current n00b entry vector is
<br>
Vinge-&gt;Anissimov-&gt;Kurzweil-&gt;Yudkowsky-&gt;Goertzel) the SIAI page in
<br>
question was, while almost certainly valid, the html equivalent of
<br>
being given the finger. As an open source nut, I'm used to programmers
<br>
being wooed to add momentum to a given project; I thought the idea is
<br>
that any code is better code than no code (cf. vaporware) and that the
<br>
more programmers you have, the more likely you are to get a few who
<br>
are any good. It seems intuitive that encouraging people _not_ to
<br>
program in the AGI sphere would be counterproductive. Add to that a
<br>
seeming lack of open source projects, tools, frameworks, templates of
<br>
any veracity to contribute to and you get left with someone who isn't
<br>
going to donate either time _or_ money until they figure out whether
<br>
_you_ are the Crazy Person... and more likely will just go back to
<br>
hacking their Linux kernel.
<br>
<p>- having said that, definitely seek out wingnuts instead of jocks.
<br>
people who work well in a team are nice to chat to at the water
<br>
cooler, but in terms of getting code flying are worth their weight in
<br>
popcorn. The guys I've met/worked with who have code running on good
<br>
proportions of boxen planet-wide have invariably been one, maybe two
<br>
guys who in person are at best rather objectionable and at worst are
<br>
complete nutballs. but what they've achieved by working in basements
<br>
and underdeveloping their social skills has had a huge impact - just
<br>
count the number of cpu ticks people give to them. How many examples
<br>
of real breakthroughs and achievements are made by pubic-headed
<br>
dingbats working at 3am and how many by well funded back-scratchers
<br>
working on the corporate farm? This seems to apply in science as well
<br>
as tech. Social skills may be nice to keep mediocre project teams
<br>
achieving their goals but all the real groundbreakers seem to be half
<br>
nuts - Bram Cohen is a great example. Vinge has a theme in one book
<br>
that seems to allude to chemically enforced Asperger's to create teams
<br>
of super-achievers.
<br>
<p>- rehashing the first point, you guys need more life in this thing.
<br>
having a high bar is needed for some things but you also need lower
<br>
entry points to develop a groundswell. Some of the non-geniuses could
<br>
maybe help put together an AGI@home to see if maybe they can get the
<br>
citizenry to contribute some of the heavyweight distributed processing
<br>
that'll be needed; and while they're at it raise some awareness and
<br>
maybe bring in some donations via welcome pages rather unlike
<br>
seed-ai-programmer.html. And where is the open source project? For
<br>
shame. Farming out tasks to teams of varying ability is a good way of
<br>
getting the job done. Provide avenues for lesser coders to be testers,
<br>
builders, system integrators and plumbing pipers as opposed to the
<br>
algorithm and psynet freaks which are, yes, absolutely essential but
<br>
shouldn't be doing journeyman work and you never know, maybe one of
<br>
your plumber coders will have personal problems, go half nuts on
<br>
crystal meth and end up writing half your thought-pattern code in a
<br>
year-long fit of beneficient mental misfiring before he offs himself.

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Huh? You don't need a PhD. in all of those subjects!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;It would certainly help to be well-rounded, but it is crazy to require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Ph.D. in (e.g.) M-Theory.  Heck, a couple of undergrad physics courses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and a dose of Brian Greene ought to be enough.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;A dose of Brian Greene is just about useless. What could be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;useful for AGI is... thermodynamics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Useful, possibly.  How is it _necessary_?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a Seed AI encoded on DNA... Does anyone deny this as a possibility?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imagine a project going about creating a Seed AI using DNA.  Sure, it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arse-about way to go about it today, but if our genetics knowledge were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater (times many many)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The original physics developments needed to create such a seed AI?  Nowt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The advanced physics knowledge needed by the development team? Nowt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The simple physics knowledge needed by the team?  Hrmmm... could be useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help the seed AI get a grip on reality... before it learned advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics for itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The simple physics knowledge needed by most members of the development team?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Zip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some well rounded knowledge could be useful to help the project know where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't need to go.  F'rinstance, some Neurology and Quantum mech might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be useful for an AGI team to know that Penrose's &quot;brain /= computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine&quot; objections are, at best, tangential to AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But not every team member needs to be a polymath.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Polymaths are useful.  At least, I hope so, as I have a limited degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vested interest in demand for polymaths.  But not every member of a team has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a pan-Paragon for the team to achieve amazing things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Teams ought to combine individuals' skills and abilities in compounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways.  They need to be able to communicate on the application of specialist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities.  That doesn't mean everyone has to be an expert in all areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not playing down what's required to be on a successful AGI team.  Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though I &quot;get&quot; (a lot of) AI and cog-sci theory, I can't programme for shit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   So don't hire me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But don't turn down a great neuroscientist/cog scientist with meta-math and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming skills (think: Giulio Tononi crossed with Jaynes, with coding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skills) just because they don't know diddley about networking / operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems / number theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Put them in a team, and make them useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Olie
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More examples:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - If the AGI project is not utilising nanotech, no nanotech knowledge is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required.  If it's using existing nanotech (eg: nanocomputers supplied by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3rd party, which are faster but appear identcal to conventional computers),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no nanotech knowledge is required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Much is made about rationality tools.   Any AGI project will have &gt;=1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality tool (eg: Bayesian reasoning), so all programmers will likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have *some* connection to the AGI's use of rationality tools.  But if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can institute the programming, does it really matter whether or not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers are themselves hyper-rational?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they are knowledgeable and insightful, does it matter if *some*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teammembers have mediocre &quot;Judgement Quotients&quot;?  If they occasionally have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a teary over which O/S they have to programme with, does this matter outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of team morale issues?  I fail to see how such natural deficiencies are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem with well managed teams.
