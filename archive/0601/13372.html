<p>Damien, if you carefully read my original proposal - rather than John's 
<br>
gloss - I spoke of doubling your money on each round.  Matching the Mega 
<br>
ball only, in the Mega Millions lottery, is good for a $3 payoff on a $1 
<br>
ticket, if I recall correctly (I'm drafting this email in a brief absence 
<br>
of Internet access).  So you can risk half your money on each round, and 
<br>
double your total funds on each win.  Richard Loosemore claimed results on 
<br>
the order of 1 in 200, which should let you win most times on a 1-in-46 
<br>
problem.
<br>
<p>(This turned out not to be correct.  Matching the Mega ball is a $2 payout. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, betting half your money, with significance on the order of 1 in 
<br>
200, should let you consistently increase your funds over time.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've bored you all, I can tell. Killfile the gullible idiot. Such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredible horseshit. Don't look, don't look.
</em><br>
<p>Here's another funny thing about parapsychology's robust, repeatable 
<br>
results - aside from the fact that you know and I know that they will 
<br>
vanish like soap bubbles popping if you try to use them to make money.
<br>
<p>Contemporary parapsychologists consistently find equally significant 
<br>
statistical evidence for negative psi as positive psi.  Similarly, when 
<br>
someone reports that subjects can significantly predict future events, 
<br>
shortly thereafter someone using roughly the same protocol reports that 
<br>
subjects can significantly manipulate past events.
<br>
<p>Now if we are talking about physical phenomena, manipulating past events is 
<br>
considerably harder to swallow than predicting the future.
<br>
<p>And if we are talking about biology, antipsi is much less of an 
<br>
evolutionary advantage than psi.
<br>
<p>And if we are talking about fraud, manipulating the past is so ridiculous 
<br>
that most fraudsters would try to fake something more plausible.
<br>
<p>Bad statistics, on the other hand, are symmetrical between psi and antipsi 
<br>
phenomena, between prediction and manipulation, and between past and future 
<br>
events.  If bad statistics produces a false appearance of positive-psi 
<br>
precognition of future events, then bad statistics should just as easily 
<br>
produce statistically significant evidence for a psi-miss manipulation of 
<br>
past events.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, on the hypothesis of bad statistics, you will find tiny effect 
<br>
sizes that are nonetheless statistically significant.  The larger the data, 
<br>
the tinier the effect size that is nonetheless statistically significant. 
<br>
You will never find anything clear, blatant, and obvious - when someone 
<br>
claims large effect sizes it will always turn out to be unrepeatable or 
<br>
fraud.  And when you try to use the effects to make money, or do anything 
<br>
else useful, they will go away.
<br>
<p>You can, I suppose, try to carefully explain this away as something other 
<br>
than bad statistics; carefully explain why antipsi is an advantage, and 
<br>
carefully explain why quantum weirdness in the brain can manipulate events 
<br>
that have already happened.  But it is a bad sign when you have to 
<br>
carefully explain things that just don't look the way you would expect them 
<br>
a priori to look.  It is like carefully explaining why God is omnipotent 
<br>
and omniscient and omnibenevolent, and yet the physical world contains 
<br>
hurricanes and tsunamis and starving babies.  You can try to come up with 
<br>
reasons why that's all part of God's plan.  But plainly the world does not 
<br>
look at all like we would a priori expect it to look, in the presence of a 
<br>
powerful benevolent entity that could fix stuff, even just the really 
<br>
really awful stuff like torture of children by the Inquisition.  The world 
<br>
does look exactly like a neutral product of natural law.  Why does psi look 
<br>
not at all like we would expect psi to look, and exactly like bad statistics?
<br>
<p>And why aren't you running out to try and double your money in the lottery? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a part of you somewhere that is using essentially the same 
<br>
model as I am, for you can predict in advance which disappointing 
<br>
experimental result you will have to excuse.
<br>
<p>I am willing to believe that parapsychologists have followed all the 
<br>
conventional rules of science.  Until parapsychologists win the lottery, or 
<br>
it's demonstrated that it was all fraud after all, this implies that the 
<br>
conventional rules of science are too weak.  It implies that orthodox 
<br>
statistical methods are such as to sustain an entire field of 
<br>
investigation, with papers regularly published on seemingly significant 
<br>
data, in the total absence of any real effect.  This is a disturbing 
<br>
prospect to face up to.  But it is not nearly as disturbing as taking at 
<br>
face value that psions can manipulate the past.
