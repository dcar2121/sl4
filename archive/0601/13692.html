<p>
Richard,
<br>
<p>I totally agree that AGI has a big potential to break through in the
<br>
next few years and provide immense profits as well as immense
<br>
scientific and humanitarian benefits.  You are definitely preaching to
<br>
the converted in this regard!!
<br>
<p>My point was a practical one: merely that nearly all business
<br>
investors are interested in investment opportunities with less
<br>
appearance of risk than AGI.
<br>
<p>Essentially, where AGI is concerned, what is needed is *research
<br>
money*.  Even for a project like Novamente, where we have a detailed
<br>
and theoretically grounded software design that we are progressively
<br>
implementing, there is *still* plenty of detail-level research to be
<br>
done to make it all work.  Business funding for research projects is
<br>
hard to come by, unless (and even if) one can make a strong argument
<br>
regarding the profitability of incremental results as well as the end
<br>
goal.  Not impossible of course -- just hard to come by.
<br>
<p>In the case of Novamente I do believe we can make profits via software
<br>
systems embodying incremental progress toward our end goal of AGI (and
<br>
we are doing so now, to a limited extent).  So I think Novamente makes
<br>
sense as a business opportunity even for fairly conventional investors
<br>
-- but that is because we have concrete plans re how to make money
<br>
from the incremental versions of our system along the path to general
<br>
AI.
<br>

<em>&gt; My take on your question is slightly different than Ben's because I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different approach to the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My answer to &quot;Why should I invest in AGI?&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because there is the potential for it to take off at a speed that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply the investor with her own personal starship within a decade or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is how.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the standard approach to AI turns out to have a Blind Spot Assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built into it  -  an assumption that is glaringly obvious when you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is there, but which otherwise is impossible to see  -  and if that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BSA turns out to a crucial blockage that has stopped progress all this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, then we could open up the floodgates by dumping that assumption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the risk of sounding like a wild optimist, I actually do believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are in this situation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We could build a learning system that acquires concepts through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, and which also has the kind of motivation/emotion system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would make it completely (and reliably) benign, we could find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves surprised at how fast it could acquire knowledge and grow up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a superintelligent AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the core of my approach, and I think it will work.  It is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically different to the standard methods that, at the very least, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not have the same drawbacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [More soon:  I am trying to corral my ideas into a website.]
