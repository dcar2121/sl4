<p>It would need to be unlikely indeed.  Several other lines of thought are &quot;more 
<br>
promising&quot;.   E.g., the prevalence of small asteroids, etc., might be high 
<br>
enough that there is a strong upper limit on speed regardless of the engine 
<br>
that you're using.   So far it's looking like the rule of thumb &quot;The smaller, 
<br>
the more common&quot; is holding true far below the level at which it was 
<br>
perviously thought to cease.  (I.e., originally it was believed that brown 
<br>
dwarfs were impossible, because matter just didn't clump into clumps that 
<br>
small...now it's looking like they may be much more common than red dwarfs.  
<br>
And there's no clear reason why this trend should stop at any particular 
<br>
point, as it seems to be driven by turbulence.)
<br>
<p>Then there's the argument of transcendence:  nobody's willing to get that far 
<br>
away from their phone line.  We already observe this, where tourists aren't 
<br>
very willing to go to places where McDonalds hasn't already implanted a 
<br>
&quot;resturant&quot;.  And it seems quite likely that things will only get more 
<br>
extreme.  (Consider the frequency of couch potatoes.)
<br>
<p>Still, a speed limit would help explain the absence of robots.  More likely, 
<br>
there's the what's to gain? argument to explain the absence of robots.  If 
<br>
nobody's willing to go, then why bother to send more than a photographer (if 
<br>
that).  And photographers might well choose to be inconspicuous, so as not to 
<br>
disrupt the scenery that they were shooting.
<br>
<p>Do you really think that mining over interstellar distances would be even 
<br>
plausibly profitable?  Slavery?  Why bother intruding, when you can get all 
<br>
the benefits more cheaply by running simulations?
<br>
<p>I'm not sure that the Fermi Paradox needs to be answered, because there are so 
<br>
many potential reasons, and plausibly different races would encounter 
<br>
different reasons.  The question really might be &quot;Why would we expect to 
<br>
encounter anyone?  What could they possibly get out of it?&quot;  A faster space 
<br>
drive doesn't help answer that question.  People are adapted to live in a 
<br>
particular environment, and other natural planets are quite unlikely to 
<br>
provide that environment.  So lebenraum isn't a plausible answer.  (Though 
<br>
see &quot;MacroLife&quot; by George Zebrowski.)
<br>
<p>Personally, I see technologically advanced races as expanding to occupy (in 
<br>
artificial structures) a few nearby solar systems at most before going in for 
<br>
virtualization.  They ones that are more aggressive are quite likely to run 
<br>
into a Matrioska Brain that will handle them in some way, so that they aren't 
<br>
aggressive anymore.  They might live through it, but I don't know if that's 
<br>
the way to bet.  I don't really see something like the Escaton as being 
<br>
plausible, but it does make a great story for singularity level 
<br>
civilizations.  (However I find Accelerando much more plausible...and much 
<br>
more likely, even if it is quite optimistic.)
