Mike,
<br>
<p>I can't help replying here, because there is an answer to your question.
<br>
<p>Amongst psi researchers, it is already well known that the presence of 
<br>
skeptics as *subjects* does have an interesting effect on some kinds of 
<br>
experiments:  they seem to make the scoring go significantly *below* 
<br>
chance.  Who knows why:  you can pick your own interpretation of what 
<br>
might be going on.  This is called the &quot;sheep-goat effect&quot; and it has 
<br>
been known for a long time.  The effect was robust enough in at least 
<br>
one experiment I knew of, that the difference between believers and 
<br>
skeptics was highly significant, whereas the overall rate was (I think) 
<br>
near chance.
<br>
<p>And for your more general question, people have considered that in great 
<br>
detail, too:  some people tried to understand how layers of influence 
<br>
extending out in time from the original observation could conceivably 
<br>
sum to leave an actual result that was non-chance.  Don't ask me what 
<br>
the latest thoughts are on that one.
