<p>
Incrementally becoming a great old one could make sense even under the
<br>
pattern view as each instance in time would be seeking some degree of
<br>
self-preservation and some degree of becoming greater than itself, but
<br>
achnowledging in the distant future it would be dead by its own definition.
<br>
This is a terrible mistake from the point of view of an individual that
<br>
doesn't discount the future, but for one that does and thinks life is only
<br>
worth living as long as it still holds novel experiences could be a good
<br>
plan.
<br>
<p>The substrate view would be falsified if an upload behaved in the same way
<br>
as the original particularly when asked questions about consciousness,
<br>
_provided this wasn't achieved by arbitrarily tweaking until it works_. If
<br>
psychic effects were statistically proved for the biological original but
<br>
not for the upload this would also be evidence for the substrate view.
<br>
<p>I have put my view here
