<p>
paul,
<br>
<p>I would have to agree with you somewhat.  The article is definitely not 
<br>
politically correct.  I see it as a somewhat tounge-in-cheek over-statement 
<br>
meant to discourage applicants who are not willing to put in the hard, 
<br>
tedious work of learning the needed knowledge and gaining the mental 
<br>
discipline to contribute as a seed AI programmer - not to mention 
<br>
discouraging less than highly talented individuals.  The seed AI programmer 
<br>
described &amp;/or implied in seed-ai-programmer.html is an imaginary being, 
<br>
unlikely to be found in the world today, but perhaps not with a probability 
<br>
of zero.  And there lies the rub.  Should we alter the entry requirements to 
<br>
be less stringent, more readily attainable by mere mortals?  Should we alter 
<br>
the article to appear less offensive, more conventional while retaining its 
<br>
filtering effect?
<br>
<p>There is not doubt that SIAI needs more talented and dedicated researchers. 
<br>
It may be that the best way to attract such individuals, even individuals of 
<br>
such high standards, is something other than the current formulation of 
<br>
seed-ai-programmer.html.  What would you suggest?
<br>

<p><p>Does that page (<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/action/seed-ai-programmer.html">http://www.intelligence.org/action/seed-ai-programmer.html</a>)
<br>
strike anyone else as incredibly elitist? Not to mention highly unrealistic?
<br>
<p><p>I really couldn't say how the takeoff is going to happen, but I highly doubt
<br>
it's going to come about as a result of some self selected group of
<br>
&quot;humanitarian geniuses&quot; who only let those they deem worthy into their club.
<br>
<p>Most likely it's going to happen at google, or CMU, or Ben's company.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to start a fight here. I believe intelligence.org's heart is in
<br>
the right place. I'm just really put off by the elitist self-important
<br>
attitude of this particular article and I think it's worthwhile for me to
<br>
express my dissapointment and my opinion that the article should be removed.
<br>
I feel that it does a very poor job of representing the institute and
<br>
singularity ideas in general.
