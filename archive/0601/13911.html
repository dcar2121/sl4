<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Huh? You don't need a PhD. in all of those subjects!

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;It would certainly help to be well-rounded, but it is crazy to require a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Ph.D. in (e.g.) M-Theory.  Heck, a couple of undergrad physics courses
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;A dose of Brian Greene is just about useless. What could be very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;useful for AGI is... thermodynamics.
</em><br>
<p>Useful, possibly.  How is it _necessary_?
<br>
<p>Imagine a Seed AI encoded on DNA... Does anyone deny this as a possibility?
<br>
<p>Imagine a project going about creating a Seed AI using DNA.  Sure, it's an 
<br>
arse-about way to go about it today, but if our genetics knowledge were 
<br>
greater (times many many)...
<br>
<p>The original physics developments needed to create such a seed AI?  Nowt.
<br>
<p>The advanced physics knowledge needed by the development team? Nowt
<br>
<p>The simple physics knowledge needed by the team?  Hrmmm... could be useful 
<br>
to help the seed AI get a grip on reality... before it learned advanced 
<br>
physics for itself.
<br>
<p>The simple physics knowledge needed by most members of the development team? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Zip.
<br>
<p>Some well rounded knowledge could be useful to help the project know where 
<br>
it doesn't need to go.  F'rinstance, some Neurology and Quantum mech might 
<br>
be useful for an AGI team to know that Penrose's &quot;brain /= computing 
<br>
machine&quot; objections are, at best, tangential to AGI.
<br>
<p>But not every team member needs to be a polymath.
<br>
<p>Polymaths are useful.  At least, I hope so, as I have a limited degree of 
<br>
vested interest in demand for polymaths.  But not every member of a team has 
<br>
to be a pan-Paragon for the team to achieve amazing things.
<br>
<p>Teams ought to combine individuals' skills and abilities in compounding 
<br>
ways.  They need to be able to communicate on the application of specialist 
<br>
abilities.  That doesn't mean everyone has to be an expert in all areas.
<br>
<p>I'm not playing down what's required to be on a successful AGI team.  Even 
<br>
though I &quot;get&quot; (a lot of) AI and cog-sci theory, I can't programme for shit. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So don't hire me.
<br>
<p>But don't turn down a great neuroscientist/cog scientist with meta-math and 
<br>
programming skills (think: Giulio Tononi crossed with Jaynes, with coding 
<br>
skills) just because they don't know diddley about networking / operating 
<br>
systems / number theory.
<br>
<p>Put them in a team, and make them useful.
<br>
<p>-- Olie
<br>
<p>More examples:
<br>
<p>- If the AGI project is not utilising nanotech, no nanotech knowledge is 
<br>
required.  If it's using existing nanotech (eg: nanocomputers supplied by a 
<br>
3rd party, which are faster but appear identcal to conventional computers), 
<br>
no nanotech knowledge is required.
<br>
<p>- Much is made about rationality tools.   Any AGI project will have &gt;=1 
<br>
rationality tool (eg: Bayesian reasoning), so all programmers will likely 
<br>
have *some* connection to the AGI's use of rationality tools.  But if they 
<br>
can institute the programming, does it really matter whether or not the 
<br>
programmers are themselves hyper-rational?
<br>
<p>If they are knowledgeable and insightful, does it matter if *some* 
<br>
teammembers have mediocre &quot;Judgement Quotients&quot;?  If they occasionally have 
<br>
a teary over which O/S they have to programme with, does this matter outside 
<br>
of team morale issues?  I fail to see how such natural deficiencies are a 
<br>
problem with well managed teams.
