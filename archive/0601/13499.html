Such comparisons have very little to teach us, because (among other 
<br>
things) the kind of ANNs people have been playing with for the last 
<br>
couple of decades are a really dumb way to go about building an 
<br>
artificial mind.
<br>
<p>It might turn out, for example, that a functional unit (say a cortical 
<br>
colummn if you want to talk neuroscience, or a concept-instantiation 
<br>
unit if you want to go the cognitive systems route) can be implemented 
<br>
by either a million neurons or by a hundred lines of code that can run 
<br>
as one of a thousand parallel threads on a single blade in a roomful of 
<br>
hardware.
<br>
<p>The crucial question is *what* is the best functional unit to emulate in 
<br>
a human brain:  somthing tiny and horrible numerous, like neurons, or 
<br>
somethinh pretty huge, like a concept-instantiation module (I am making 
<br>
that phrase up, but you get what I mean).
<br>
<p>Me, I am firmly convinced that we would do best by getting inspiration 
<br>
from what neurons do, but not even think about emulating them as if they 
<br>
were the highest functional units.

<em>&gt; Hello.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Im trying to wrap my head around this AI thing, and entirely how far 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along we are in measures of computational power compared to whats going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on in the human body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know many believes that there's shortcuts to be made, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvements of that model nature has provided us with, the biological 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural network.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still. Humor me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's my approximated assumptions, based on practical experience with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ann's and some wiki.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computational power of the human mind ;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100*10^9 neurons, 1000 connections each gives about 100*10^12 operations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _at the same time_ .. now on average a neuron fires about 80 times each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second, that gives us a whopping ~10^14 operations/computations each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On my machine, a 3GHz workstation, im able to run a feedforward network 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at about 150.000 operations /second WITH training(backprop) .. take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training out of the equation and we may, lets shoot high, land on 1 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million 'touched' neurons/second .. now from 10^6 -&gt; 10^14 .. that's one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell of a big number!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also .. thinking about training over several training sets (as is usual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case) wouldn't I be correct at making an analogy to linear algebra ? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking of each training set as a vector, each set having their own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction. In essense, two identical training sets would be linear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'depended' on each other and subject for elimination? (thinking there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be an mathematical sound approach here towards eliminating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semi-redundant training data!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hope its not too far off topic!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best regards
</em><br>
