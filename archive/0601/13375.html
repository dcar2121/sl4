<p>Different report, FWIW. Still...

<p>Yes. But also, crucially I'd have thought whichever side one favors:
<br>
<p>&lt;Neither Utts nor I had the time or resources to fully scrutinize the 
<br>
laboratory procedures or data from these experiments. Instead, we relied on 
<br>
what we could glean from reading the technical reports. Two of the 
<br>
experiments had recently been published in the Journal of Parapsychology. 
<br>
The difficulty here is that these newly declassified experiments have not 
<br>
been in the public arena for a sufficient time to have been carefully and 
<br>
critically scrutinized.&gt;
<br>
<p>Haven't seen anything in the subsequent 9 years indicating, though, that 
<br>
either changed their opinions, except that the following is bitterly denied 
<br>
by the Stargate people I've communicated with:
<br>
<p>&lt;In the time available to us, it was impossible to scrutinize carefully all 
<br>
the of [sic] documents generated by this program. Instead, we focused our 
<br>
efforts on evaluating the ten studies done at Science Applications 
<br>
International Corporation (SAIC) during the early 1990s. These were 
<br>
selected, in consultation with the principal investigator, as representing 
<br>
the best experiments in the set. &gt;
<br>
<p>Dr May states that the material made available excluded the most 
<br>
significant, to-this-day still classified work--understandably, since these 
<br>
were of highly sensitive topics. Bugger, eh.
