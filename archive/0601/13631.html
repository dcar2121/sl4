<p>I think this uses the wrong approach.
<br>
It suggests that one should evaluate an
<br>
entire ecosystem of ethical systems for
<br>
its overall utility/goodness.  This is
<br>
a top-down approach.  Evolving systems
<br>
are distributed systems, which need a
<br>
distributed approach, not a centralized
<br>
one in which some ethical God decides
<br>
what the appropriate ethical code will
<br>
be for each organism.
<br>
<p>Such a God's judgement would be
<br>
irrelevant anyway.
<br>
What would you do with it?  You can't
<br>
impose ethical systems on less-intelligent
<br>
organisms.  They will evolve an ethics
<br>
that works for them.  Rather, a system
<br>
of ethics is like any other evolving
<br>
system:  Each system of ethics is a
<br>
strategy adopted by individuals seeking
<br>
to maximize their utility, or by some
<br>
group maximizing group utility.
<br>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that, in a dynamical distributed ethical
<br>
system, no one evaluates the utility of the entire system of ethical
<br>
codes.  Populations arise that share an ethical code, and just as an
<br>
evolving species adapts so as to maximize its own utility, each ethical
<br>
code adapts so as to maximize the utility (or reproduction) of the
<br>
group holding it.
<br>
<p>This is undesirable.  It says, for instance, that an ethical code
<br>
against contraception is &quot;superior&quot; to an ethical code that allows it. 
<br>
But I don't see how to avoid this under any distributed system of
<br>
ethics.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the study of transhuman ethics should be a descriptive rather
<br>
than a prescriptive study.  But then, of what use is it?
