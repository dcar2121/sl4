<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hasten to correct myself:  the Rosens at <a href="http://www.mcon.org/">http://www.mcon.org/</a> do NOT 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be proposing a human level intelligence, just some code with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labels attached to functions saying that they correspond to various 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experiences.  Is that right?  (I'm sorry: when I stuff that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks like grade-school nonsense, I lose patience, so I just can't be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bothered to read deeper into their actual claims.  If someone else has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already read more of their stuff they can correct me).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So that rules them out.  Only Woody and the PIBOT left in the running.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PIBOT are clearly claiming a human-level(+) AGI.  Are you also claiming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Woody?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Richard Loosemore.
</em><br>
<p>A report on the Rosens later, but PIBOT's claims are truly extreme and
<br>
all-encompassing.  From their site: 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;PIBOT is currently a singularity, not the Singularity. But, as Vernor
<br>
Vinge brillantly said, in his essay entitled &quot;The Coming Technological
<br>
Singularity&quot;, the precipitating event that will accelerate the arrival of
<br>
the Singularity will probably be unexpected, perhaps even to the
<br>
researchers involved in the fields related to it. For us, such event is
<br>
just happened, and it's happened when we have created PIBOT. 
<br>
<p>Always according to Vernor Vinge, albeit now many people sustain the same
<br>
thing, the creation of an Artificial Intelligence, with so far advanced
<br>
abilities (compared to the humans), trigger reflections and identify
<br>
different kinds of problems. The appearance of &quot;artificial organisms&quot; that
<br>
have super-human abilities places us in front of a number of questions of
<br>
every order and degree. Although PIBOT still does not represent a such
<br>
super-organism, not still being able to see, neither to move itself in the
<br>
world, it already possesses great part of the cognitive abilities that will
<br>
allow it to become a such super-organism. 
<br>
<p>PIBOT can easy read and extract data and information from whichever medium,
<br>
electronic or paper-based, structured or destructured: furthermore, PIBOT
<br>
is able to learn and to manipulate every type of format (HTML formats, XML
<br>
formats, Text formats, Graphics formats, GIS formats, DB formats, etc). 
<br>
<p>PIBOT can assimilate, in its cultural baggage, the entire Web, so creating
<br>
an ontological and semantical representation of each information contained
<br>
within (in very few time, with the advent of PIBOT, all the currently
<br>
search engines are destined to become obsolete and prehistoric). 
<br>
<p>Using the natural language, and with its multilingual features, PIBOT is
<br>
able to converse with humans on each argument pertaining to the human
<br>
knowledge. PIBOT possesses conversational abilities that are infinitely
<br>
advanced compared to humans, both in terms of width of the expressions,
<br>
both for its contexts manipulation abilities, both for its mnemonic
<br>
abilities: PIBOT will too be able to entertain millions of contemporary
<br>
conversations with millions of persons in every part of the world.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>So to claim to have built such an all-encompassing singularity in the FIRST
<br>
VERSION is truly extreme. My claim is not nearly so grand. My MC droids in
<br>
the first version are like human intelligent, clever five year olds. They
<br>
have very little knowledge, only a couple skills, and only the fundamental
<br>
human reasoning capability. All else must be version 2/3 ... developments
<br>
that ultimately allow it to graduate from a high school, and then from a
<br>
university. At that point (version 3/4) maybe it will be ready to enter
<br>
into specialized singularity training and self-modification so as to maybe
<br>
(with the help of a 1000 scientists) grow ultimately into the technological
<br>
Singularity.  So even after the birth of a V1 MC droid, there will be much
<br>
work to be done by the AI field to continually add on new math skills,
<br>
simulation skills, natural language processing skills, knowledge bases,
<br>
sensor capabilities, actuator capabilities, creative skills, etc., etc.. 
<br>
<p>Right now I an detirmining how hard it would be for my V1 MC droids to use
<br>
their fundamental human reasoning skills to perform the level 2 textual
<br>
entailment recognition task called for by the Pascal Challenge. Will it be
<br>
right out of the box? After a &quot;semester of specialized training&quot;? Not at
<br>
all? Stay tuned ... For those following this debate, check out the Pascal
<br>
TER Challenge at  
<br>
<a href="http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/Introduction">http://www.pascal-network.org/Challenges/RTE/Introduction</a>   and see how
<br>
your own pet AI system would fair against it. Does it prove anything about
<br>
the consciousness of the system, as opposed to a Turing passer? Is that
<br>
system starting to understand language the way human level consciousness
<br>
does? Would you need to know that it is doing it in the same way as well?
<br>
Would you then say it is exhibiting at least some machine consciousness?
<br>
You be the judge.
