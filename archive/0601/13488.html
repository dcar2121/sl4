(Responding to Psy Kosh &lt;<a href="mailto:psykosh@gmail.com?Subject=RE:%20Fermi's%20paradox%20and%20observer%20selection%20effects?">psykosh@gmail.com</a>&gt; 's observations re replicators 
<br>
and Fermi paradox, below)
<br>
<p>This seems like a perfectly reasonable application of the same meta-idea as 
<br>
the Anthropic principle:
<br>
<p>Intelligence is most likely to evolve independently, looking for other 
<br>
existing intelligences, only where there has not been some pre-existing 
<br>
&quot;consuming&quot; intelligence.
<br>
<p>Please, consider for a second, whether it matches your view of Friendlyness, 
<br>
to consume the resources available for future intelligences (and the 
<br>
ecosystems that cultivate them), before they have an opportunity to utilise 
<br>
them?
<br>
<p>It seems to me that stunting the development of future intelligences through 
<br>
resource depletion is just as inconsiderate as stunting the development of 
<br>
concurrent intelligences.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Now, is it just me, or does this seem to be another example of how 
<br>
consumptive* attitudes towards resources - that they are there to be used at 
<br>
the first available opportunity - have a strong tendency to cause selfish 
<br>
behaviours?
<br>
<p>All that dead rock out there /can/ be seen as a resource available for 
<br>
exploitation.  But it can also be viewed as having value in itself.
<br>
<p>There is wisdom in being prudent - doing the most with limited resources, 
<br>
rather than immediately reaching for more.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that using more resources is necessarily a bad thing, but 
<br>
using more resources where fewer resources would suffice _is_ Waste.

<p>Christian Zielinski &lt;<a href="mailto:zielinski@transhumanismus.org?Subject=RE:%20Fermi's%20paradox%20and%20observer%20selection%20effects?">zielinski@transhumanismus.org</a>&gt; posted the following the 
<br>
other day:
<br>
<p>&quot;With growing technology the energy consumption of such a civilisation 
<br>
should grow too.
<br>
Let's assume it for the sake as a linear relation&quot;
<br>
<p>I don’t see that technology need have a linear relationship with energy 
<br>
consumption.  Quite the contrary – I think that most technology revolves 
<br>
around reducing the resources needed to achieve outcomes.  A bigger 
<br>
engineering project isn’t an advancement of technology; it’s just more of 
<br>
that one tech.  A mound of 1000 blocks uses no more tech than a mound of 100 
<br>
blocks.  However, a tower of 100 blocks fitted together in a structurally 
<br>
sound manner /is/ an instantiation of greater technology.  A taller 
<br>
structure using more bricks isn’t technology – using glue is.
<br>
<p>If it is possible to perform computations with negligible energy 
<br>
consumption, as reversible computing suggests, that would imply that there 
<br>
would be no need for an advanced civilisation to increase its energy 
<br>
consumption.
<br>
<p>So, why would an advanced intelligence “spam the galaxy with replicators or 
<br>
themselves or something?”  Why would we spam other peoples’ inboxes?
<br>
<p>To quote Calvin:
<br>
<p>“Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in 
<br>
the
<br>
universe is that none of it has tried to contact us”
<br>
<p>-- Olie
<br>
<p>* I went to a dictionary to check that this was a &quot;real&quot; word.  Turns out 
<br>
the nearest dictionary available, published in 1962, didn't have any other 
<br>
meaning for consumption except &quot;sickness&quot;.

<em>&gt;Subject: Fermi's paradox and observer selection effects?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Tue, 10 Jan 2006 03:04:20 -0500
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Just a wee bit of wild speculation I had:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let's consider universes in which some other intelligent species
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed slightly before us, sent out Non Newman replicators or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somesuch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, if they had, then we'd expect to see such probes and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them all over... But wait, if they were, especially via the Von Newman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spamming of the galaxy, including our own personal favorite planet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where would we evolve?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ie, I'm going to suggest the possibility that once at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;species has spammed the galaxy with replicators or themselves or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something, then it'd be much less likely that human (or human like)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life could then develop, since the resources of the world would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already be in the process of being munched on by the replicators and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or the members of the species themselves. Any galaxy already taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over would have less places and/or opportunity for something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;essentially like us&quot; (leave it to you do decide what the proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reference class is here) to develop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So we may then be able to validly say that we have no right to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supprised at the lack of signs of such, since the lack of such may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a near prequesite for us existing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course, we'd also expect as a prior &quot;number of galaxies in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible universes with something showing up sufficiently before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans to 'take over' before we show up&quot; &gt; &quot;number of galaxies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which we're among the first, sufficiently early at least that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing's 'taken over' yet.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So the exact relation of p(humans developing | someone else took over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first) * p(someone else took first) vs p(humans developing | noone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;took over first) * p(no one took over first) is the question. My claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that the second conditional is significantly larger than the first,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and my wild eyed speculation is that the ratio is sufficiently large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compared to the ratio of the first prior to the second that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shouldn't actually be supprised at, well, at the Fermi &quot;paradox&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or is this all just complete nonsense? :)
