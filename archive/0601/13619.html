I am noticing the change.  I have been reading this list since 2003.  It was 
<br>
more interesting to me back then.  If only I had been more serious about 
<br>
studying back then.  Now, most of the stuff on here seems to be ridiculous 
<br>
philosophical garbage or other things that can't be proven in the least bit, 
<br>
and is a complete waste of time to talk about.  It's ironic that most of us 
<br>
know that a transhuman AI can probably work these problems out, but instead 
<br>
of figuring out how to make the AI, we waste time on these senseless 
<br>
bickerings.  Psi?  Free Will?  These subjects yield zero gain.  And don't 
<br>
even try to say that it is relevant, because that's the most ridiculous 
<br>
thing I've ever heard.  It would be better to talk about subjects that 
<br>
actually gain something.
<br>
<p>I notice that a certain person on this list (not the owner) usually tells 
<br>
someone to read the entire SL4 archive before posting.  First, who is going 
<br>
to read the archives if it's full of gibberish like the recent discussions? 
<br>
Second, what about working students?  I am devoted to the singularity, but 
<br>
that doesn't mean I am willing to spend every minute of my life outside of 
<br>
class reading every senseless post just so I can continue bickering.
<br>
<p>There is a lot of room for improvement here, and despite what I said above I 
<br>
consider myself loyal to the SL4 list.  There are good times and bad times. 
<br>
The discussion will probably improve one of these days.  I'd improve the 
<br>
discussion myself, but I'm not worthy because I didn't have time to read 
<br>
everything.

Subject: SL4?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It seems to me that in recent months (? possibly longer), the content on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SL4-list is no longer... shocking enough to be properly SL4. Endless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undergraduate-level discussions on basic philosophical issues. Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others noticing the same topic-drift, or have I just become dangerously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comfortable with real SL4 content, so much so that it seems trivial now?
