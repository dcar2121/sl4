<p>
I was reading the discussion at
<br>
<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0134.html">http://www.kurzweilai.net/meme/frame.html?main=/articles/art0134.html</a>
<br>
<p>It seems there are some opposed to the evolution of humanity's software when
<br>
allowed to run on more capable/expansive hardware, saying that the whole
<br>
notion of uploading is sick or somehow risks an undefined concept of
<br>
&quot;soul.&quot;  I'm sure those who knew anything about DaVinci dissecting corpses
<br>
to learn the mechanics of muscles and viscera believed the whole thing
<br>
utterly ghoulish, but at the same time kept it from a public that would
<br>
certainly have been appalled to the point of arresting him.  (No, i have not
<br>
done sufficient research on DaVinci's grave-robbing to be an authority - i'm
<br>
only speaking from unsourced &quot;public knowledge&quot;)
<br>
<p>I believe the research done by &quot;computer science&quot; in the realm of
<br>
reverse-engineering the biological brain is very similar to the macabre
<br>
research on the physical body.  If the analogy is sound, then the
<br>
yet-unrealized potential of thoroughly understanding our own mental hardware
<br>
has application in realms as far beyond AI as muscular-skeletal principles
<br>
are applied beyond mundane engineering of cranes or bridges.  The direction
<br>
this point is going is ultimately to Singularity - which is at the same time
<br>
self-evident to anyone on this list, it is also the only truly relevant
<br>
topic.  So although this is not a suprising revelation, it is another point
<br>
of reference along the way.
