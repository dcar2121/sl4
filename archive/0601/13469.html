<br>
<p>Why I Hope the Standard Model is Wrong about Why There is More Matter Than 
<br>
Antimatter
<br>
<p>The Standard Model of particle physics — a theory of all forces and particles 
<br>
except gravity and a theory that has survived all tests over the past thirty 
<br>
years — says it is possible to convert matter entirely into energy. 
<br>
Old-fashioned nuclear physics allows some matter to be converted into energy, 
<br>
but because nuclear physics requires the number of heavy particles like neutrons 
<br>
and protons, and light particles like electrons, to be separately conserved in 
<br>
nuclear reactions, only a small fraction (less than 1%) of the mass of the 
<br>
uranium or plutonium in an atomic bomb can be converted into energy. The 
<br>
Standard Model says that there is a way to convert all the mass of ordinary 
<br>
matter into energy; for example, it is in principle possible to convert the 
<br>
proton and electron making up a hydrogen atom entirely into energy. Particle 
<br>
physicists have long known about this possibility, but have considered it 
<br>
forever irrelevant to human technology because the energy required to convert 
<br>
matter into pure energy via this process is at the very limit of our most 
<br>
powerful accelerators (a trillion electron volts, or one TeV).
<br>
<p>I am very much afraid that the particle physicists are wrong about this Standard 
<br>
Model pure energy conversion process being forever irrelevant to human affairs. 
<br>
I have recently come to believe that the consistency of quantum field theory 
<br>
requires that it should be possible to convert up to 100 kilograms of ordinary 
<br>
matter into pure energy via this process using a device that could fit inside 
<br>
the trunk of a car, a device that could be manufactured in a small factory. Such 
<br>
a device would solve all our energy problems — we would not need fossil fuels — 
<br>
but 100 kilograms of energy is the energy released by a 1,000-megaton nuclear 
<br>
bomb. If such a bomb can be manufactured in a small factory, then terrorists 
<br>
everywhere will eventually have such weapons. I fear for the human race if this 
<br>
comes to pass. I very hope I am wrong about the technological feasibility of 
<br>
such a bomb.&quot;
