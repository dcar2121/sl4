Sejnowski's little essay (below) was published as part of the www.edge.org
<br>
&quot;Dangerous Ideas&quot; event. Although his idea is not original, some of his
<br>
argument are (at least to me).

<p>When will the Internet become aware of itself?
<br>
<p>I never thought that I would become omniscient during my lifetime, but as
<br>
Google continues to improve and online information continues to expand I
<br>
have achieved omniscience for all practical purposes. The Internet has
<br>
created a global marketplace for ideas and products, making it possible for
<br>
individuals in the far corners of the world to automatically connect
<br>
directly to each other. The Internet has achieved these capabilities by
<br>
growing exponentially in total communications bandwidth. How does the
<br>
communications power of the Internet compare with that of the cerebral
<br>
cortex, the most interconnected part of our brains?
<br>
<p>Cortical connections are expensive because they take up volume and cost
<br>
energy to send information in the form of spikes along axons. About 44% of
<br>
the cortical volume in humans is taken up with long-range connections,
<br>
called the white matter. Interestingly, the thickness of gray matter, just a
<br>
few millimeters, is nearly constant in mammals that range in brain volume
<br>
over five orders of magnitude, and the volume of the white matter scales
<br>
approximately as the 4/3 power of the volume of the gray matter. The larger
<br>
the brain, the larger the fraction of resources devoted to communications
<br>
compared to computation.
<br>
However, the global connectivity in the cerebral cortex is extremely sparse:
<br>
The probability of any two cortical neurons having a direct connection is
<br>
around one in a hundred for neurons in a vertical column 1 mm in diameter,
<br>
but only one in a million for more distant neurons. Thus, only a small
<br>
fraction of the computation that occurs locally can be reported to other
<br>
areas, through a small fraction of the cells that connect distant cortical
<br>
areas.
<br>
<p>Despite the sparseness of cortical connectivity, the potential bandwidth of
<br>
all of the neurons in the human cortex is approximately a terabit per
<br>
second, comparable to the total world backbone capacity of the Internet.
<br>
However, this capacity is never achieved by the brain in practice because
<br>
only a fraction of cortical neurons have a high rate of firing at any given
<br>
time. Recent work by Simon Laughlin suggests that another physical
<br>
constraint -- energy--limits the brain's ability to harness its potential
<br>
bandwidth.
<br>
<p>The cerebral cortex also has a massive amount of memory. There are
<br>
approximately one billion synapses between neurons under every square
<br>
millimeter of cortex, or about one hundred million million synapses overall.
<br>
Assuming around a byte of storage capacity at each synapse (including
<br>
dynamic as well as static properties), this comes to a total of 10^15 bits
<br>
of storage. This is comparable to the amount of data on the entire Internet;
<br>
Google can store this in terabyte disk arrays and has hundreds of thousands
<br>
of computers simultaneously sifting through it.
<br>
<p>Thus, the internet and our ability to search it are within reach of the
<br>
limits of the raw storage and communications capacity of the human brain,
<br>
and should exceed it by 2015.
<br>
<p>Leo van Hemmen and I recently asked 23 neuroscientists to think about what
<br>
we don't yet know about the brain, and to propose a question so fundamental
<br>
and so difficult that it could take a century to solve, following in the
<br>
tradition of Hilbert's 23 problems in mathematics. Christof Koch and Francis
<br>
Crick speculated that the key to understanding consciousness was global
<br>
communication:  How do neurons in the diverse parts of the brain manage to
<br>
coordinate despite the limited connectivity?  Sometimes, the communication
<br>
gets crossed, and V. S. Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard asked whether
<br>
synesthetes, rare individuals who experience crossover in sensory perception
<br>
such as hearing colors, seeing sounds, and tasting tactile sensations, might
<br>
give us clues to how the brain evolved.
<br>
<p>There is growing evidence that the flow of information between parts of the
<br>
cortex is regulated by the degree of synchrony of the spikes within
<br>
populations of cells that represent perceptual states. Robert Desimone and
<br>
his colleagues have examined the effects of attention on cortical neurons in
<br>
awake, behaving monkeys and found the coherence between the spikes of single
<br>
neurons in the visual cortex and local field potentials in the gamma band,
<br>
30-80 Hz, increased when the covert attention of a monkey was directed
<br>
toward a stimulus in the receptive field of the neuron. The coherence also
<br>
selectively increased when a monkey searched for a target with a cued color
<br>
or shape amidst a large number of distracters. The increase in coherence
<br>
means that neurons representing the stimuli with the cued feature would have
<br>
greater impact on target neurons, making them more salient.
<br>
<p>The link between attention and spike-field coherence raises a number of
<br>
interesting questions. How does top-down input from the prefrontal cortex
<br>
regulate the coherence of neurons in other parts of the cortex through
<br>
feedback connections? How is the rapidity of the shifts in coherence
<br>
achieved?  Experiments on neurons in cortical slices suggest that inhibitory
<br>
interneurons are connected to each other in networks and are responsible for
<br>
gamma oscillations. Researchers in my laboratory have used computational
<br>
models to show that excitatory inputs can rapidly synchronize a subset of
<br>
the inhibitory neurons that are in competition with other inhibitory
<br>
networks.  Inhibitory neurons, long thought to merely block activity, are
<br>
highly effective in synchronizing neurons in a local column already firing
<br>
in response to a stimulus.
<br>
<p>The oscillatory activity that is thought to synchronize neurons in different
<br>
parts of the cortex occurs in brief bursts, typically lasting for only a few
<br>
hundred milliseconds. Thus, it is possible that there is a packet structure
<br>
for long-distance communication in the cortex, similar to the packets that
<br>
are used to communicate on the Internet, though with quite different
<br>
protocols. The first electrical signals recorded from the brain in 1875 by
<br>
Richard Caton were oscillatory signals that changed in amplitude and
<br>
frequency with the state of alertness. The function of these oscillations
<br>
remains a mystery, but it would be remarkable if it were to be discovered
<br>
that these signals held the secrets to the brain's global communications
<br>
network.
<br>
<p>Since its inception in 1969, the Internet has been scaled up to a size not
<br>
even imagined by its inventors, in contrast to most engineered systems,
<br>
which fall apart when they are pushed beyond their design limits. In part,
<br>
the Internet achieves this scalability because it has the ability to
<br>
regulate itself, deciding on the best routes to send packets depending on
<br>
traffic conditions. Like the brain, the Internet has circadian rhythms that
<br>
follow the sun as the planet rotates under it. The growth of the Internet
<br>
over the last several decades more closely resembles biological evolution
<br>
than engineering.
<br>
How would we know if the Internet were to become aware of itself?  The
<br>
problem is that we don't even know if some of our fellow creatures on this
<br>
planet are self aware. For all we know the Internet is already aware of
<br>
itself.
