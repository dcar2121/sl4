<p><p>There is no language that does not use vast numbers of pointers.  The

only difference is in where the programmer is located that is  
<br>
responsible for handling them correctly.  Anyone with sufficient  
<br>
experience and familiarity with the idioms and patterns of C  
<br>
programming will have few, if any, problems with pointers.   Not  
<br>
having to deal with memory allocation and pointers directly buys  
<br>
convenience and a reduction in lines of code at the expense of  
<br>
performance.
<br>
<p><p>The language you choose is largely immaterial as long as you know how  
<br>
to use that language and it is comfortable for you.  Design and  
<br>
verification is not particularly constrained by runtime performance,  
<br>
just developer/designer performance, and once you have completed this  
<br>
step you can always convert the code into C.  There is no evidence  
<br>
that language selection matters for AGI beyond what makes the  
<br>
programmer happy doing whatever it is they are trying to do.
<br>
<p><p>(As an aside on C versus C++, C is only slightly less convenient but  
<br>
has much more reliable compilers and libraries in my experience.   
<br>
I've had broken C++ compilers introduce subtle and not-so-subtle run- 
<br>
time bugs in code that was technically correct more than once.  And  
<br>
if you really care about performance, good C tends to be a bit faster  
<br>
than good C++ anyway.)
