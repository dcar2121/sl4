</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You missed the point.  A corporation can own stock in corporations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including itself.  The corporation can own anything including hardware.
</em><br>
<p>Your original post: &quot;a corporate AI ... owns a controlling block of stock in 
<br>
itself&quot;.
<br>
<p>That doesn't make any sense as far as I can see. Legally, an AI being considered 
<br>
akin to a vase or rock, cannot own any shares in any corporation. The term 
<br>
&quot;corporate AI&quot; as you're using it makes no sense legally.
<br>
<p>Can an AI attempt to maintain control over the actions of a corporation via 
<br>
various methods without actually itself owning the controlling stock? Perhaps, 
<br>
but as I mentioned in my first message such an arrangement seems rather 
<br>
pointless and overcomplicated. The AI in such a case is simply property of the 
<br>
corporation, and relies on its control mechanisms over the humans who actually 
<br>
perform the actions of the corporation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Generally only humans, and other business entities can legally own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; shares AFAIK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Also, I don't think a hardware/software system could legally be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; appointed into any corporate office, such as CEO. At best, you could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; appoint some humans into those positions whose employment contracts or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perhaps the corporate bylaws or something state that they will only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; take actions suggested to them by the output of the hardware/software 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; system. But if you're forced to arrange things like this, then why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bother with all the corporate hassle when in the end you are just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; property with no legal rights, and relying on a group of people to do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what you ask - might as well skip the corporation and just hook up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with a single human owner and be their personal property.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point of the post I was responding too was how to provide rights for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs.  This is a route, a &quot;legal fiction&quot; if you will that could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploited to generate &quot;legal persons&quot; who would have rights within the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scope of existing legal frameworks.
</em><br>
<p>See above. The corporation that owns the AI property would have rights, but 
<br>
exercising and/or defending those rights would be delegated to the human 
<br>
officers in control of the corporation. The AI itself has no direct rights at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Eliezer is right about the speed with which a seed AI goes way beyond 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans, the problem will be humans keeping any rights at all rather than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuring out how AIs of human level or above should be treated at law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Of course, and I happen to agree. But I can't resist being pedantic on this 
<br>
little thread for some reason.
