<em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20JQ%20Test%201.0">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Perhaps they are confused by the difference between evidential &quot;if&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;counterfactual &quot;if&quot;, and logical &quot;if&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm afraid their confusion is much less technical than that. It's like they 
<br>
pick up and understand details without being curious. They just weed out the 
<br>
desired patterns and algorithms and follow them, instead of attempting to 
<br>
establish general case principles that generalize over these fields of 
<br>
patterns.
<br>
<p>The problem with people doing this is that they are not pulling the full 
<br>
utility potential out of their ideas. Instead of having inference-making 
<br>
potential on each of the basic principles of the logic, they only have 
<br>
inference-making potential on the most abstract and superficial qualities of 
<br>
the general ideas. For example, they could solve the given logic problem in 
<br>
the exercises, but that's about the extent of the utility of their 
<br>
understanding. This is the only situation in which the concepts they have 
<br>
actually effectively mean something- the only situation in which their ideas 
<br>
are effectively consistent with some given problem.
<br>
<p>They don't have the curiosity. They feel no desire to ask questions at all, 
<br>
except where they absolutely have to. And even then the questions and 
<br>
answers will lose their interest unless it is specifically under question.
<br>
<p>Feel like you know something vs. Feel like you don't know something
<br>
<p>It's dramatically more appropriate for the average person to feel as though 
<br>
they do know, rather than to get caught up in the seeming endless turmoil of 
<br>
not knowing.
