<em>&gt; I've yet to see a decent argument for why this would be a bad thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've seen a whole lot of responses along the lines of &quot;I get to choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for myself what I want to do!&quot; and &quot;We must respect the wishes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; autonomous, intelligent, rational adult humans!&quot;, and both of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first reply is effectively the same argument a puppy gives when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you take it to the vet, or a child gives when you make it eat its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetables. And we near-universally agree that it doesn't matter that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the puppy or the child or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other-less-intelligent-less-rational-sentient-being thinks it wants;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we know better (most of the time), and we impose our will for the good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the &quot;lesser&quot; being.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is circular logic. You're claiming the conclusion &quot;transhumans have the
<br>
right to treat humans like human adults treat children&quot;, but your argument
<br>
for it is &quot;humans are to transhumans as children are to human adults&quot;; so at
<br>
the very least you have provided no non-circular argument _for_ your
<br>
position.
<br>
<p>Here are some arguments against:
<br>
<p>Children are specifically adapted for an environment where their volition
<br>
will at times be overridden by adults; they are not as they would need to be
<br>
if they were free to make their own decisions at all times. Human adults are
<br>
_not_ similarly adapted to have their volition overridden by transhumans.
<br>
<p>As a matter of objective fact, an 8 year old whose volition is sometimes
<br>
overridden by his parents will grow up happier - and more grateful for the
<br>
results - than one whose volition never is. The counterpart for humans
<br>
versus transhumans is not only unproven, but a null argument even if it were
<br>
true (on the grounds of being too trivial a criterion to meet: wireheading).
<br>
<p>Children just have to live with the way things are; they don't get a say in
<br>
designing their parents. We do get a say in designing the entities that will
<br>
exist in our world next century.
<br>
<p>The second reply is a variation on the first, but requires more
<br>
<em>&gt; comment. Specifically, it holds up the *current* level of autonomy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, or rationality most humans exhibit as sacrosanct, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in-practice binary distinction between our level and that of &quot;lesser&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings. But one of the key realizations leading to transhumanism is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is nothing special or sacred about humans-as-they-are-now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in and of itself.
</em><br>
<p><p>This isn't a &quot;realization&quot;, but a disagreement with a moral axiom. I value
<br>
humanity in and of itself - it constitutes my primary reason for wanting the
<br>
Singularity to proceed and go well, and my sole reason for wanting it so
<br>
badly that I'm willing to devote my life to trying to increment the
<br>
probability that this will occur.
<br>
<p>I understand that other people have different axioms; my proposed solution
<br>
is therefore to find a path that, to the extent reasonably possible,
<br>
respects the right of everyone (you included) to get what they want out of
<br>
the future. I will suggest that &quot;I get what I want and you get what you
<br>
want&quot; is something that we can agree on as a shared goal, and is therefore
<br>
objectively better than one party working towards &quot;I get what I want, blow
<br>
you Jack&quot; - this sort of thing is where the concept of morality comes from
<br>
in the first place, after all.
<br>
<p>To claim the current level of rationality found in
<br>
<em>&gt; humans is the delineator for when we or any other higher beings should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect another being's choices/autonomy is to place yourself squarely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Fukuyama/Kass camp of error.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the main problems I personally have with being forced to live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this or that way or do thus-and-such or undergo certain medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedures is that I can't be sure the higher being has my best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interests in mind.
</em><br>
<p><p>That is one of the problems I have with that idea, but I also have the
<br>
problems &quot;I value freedom in and of itself&quot; and &quot;Maybe the 'higher' being's
<br>
definition of 'best' isn't the same as mine&quot;; and you haven't done anything
<br>
to address those.
<br>
<p>But neither can puppies and neither can children,
<br>
<em>&gt; and that fact doesn't stop us from forcing our decisions on puppies &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children, so why should our petulant protests stop posthumans from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing the same to us?
</em><br>
<p><p>If this &quot;might makes right&quot; logic is to be accepted, then what humanity
<br>
should do is protest now, while it will have force: i.e. shut down the
<br>
Singularity Institute forthwith. Are you really sure this is the right
<br>
answer?
