<p>Yes a loop where you change is what I meant, since we're vectors, not

<p><p>If we're going to get from birth to now looped, can I at least pick some

<p><em>&gt; &quot;Perfect&quot; and &quot;utopia&quot; are rather vague concepts, I think I'd need to

<p><p>You mean the UN thought police world up to the point where the kzinti did

humanity the very great service of providing an external enemy? Yep, fun in
<br>
the &quot;dystopia with slow agonizing descent (since there probably aren't any
<br>
kzinti in our universe) into an existential disaster of the Shriek variety&quot;

sense - unfortunately, that strikes me as one of the more probable failure

modes for our world.
