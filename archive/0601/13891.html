<p>
For the sake
<br>
<em>&gt;of completeness, I'll also note that while McKinstry started out wanting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apply hyperspace geometry to abstract state spaces (common enough, even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI; see &quot;VC dimension&quot;), in his final year he became interested in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*physical* hyperspaces of string theory, where Hopf maps really have found
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some application, so evidently he started thinking about this space of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representational states as being encoded in fundamental physical variables.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well we know that mental states are somehow encoded into electrical patterns 
<br>
in the brain, that is in 3-space, but is the implication of his hypothesis 
<br>
that the hyperspatial encoding of representation (such as our perception of 
<br>
temporal causation) is somehow in analogy to the actual hyperspatility of 
<br>
quantum strings? Hopf maps are primarily applied to sypersymettric models, 
<br>
which suggests to me that McKinstry was trying to explore synchronic causation 
<br>
from a cognitive perspective. I'm not smart or informed enough to comment on 
<br>
whether or not thats quackery or daring genuis, but its a fascinating 
<br>
approach.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;And how does this relate to his AI enterprise, the Mindpixel Project?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mindpixel had accumulated a list of thousands of propositions, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;mindpixels&quot;, which were to be a sample of the space of all possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thoughts, and indexed by a single parameter, consensus probability of truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(He started using Google query probability as a ranking parameter at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;end.) I think that eventually he wanted to devise a seven-dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indexing system as interface to his archive of mindpixels, along the lines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of his brain theory, which would then be a component of an AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.mindpixel.com/chris/2005/08/my-motivation-for-creating-new-unified">http://www.mindpixel.com/chris/2005/08/my-motivation-for-creating-new-unified</a>
</em><br>
.html
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think theres something to the parameter of consensus probability of truth, 
<br>
and utilizing Google as a ranking parameter is an approach growing only more 
<br>
robust. However, I get the feeling that while such an indexing system would 
<br>
provide a lot of priors for the AGI to induce its own limited matrix of 
<br>
understanding, there would still need to be an equally novel patterning system 
<br>
to create a feedback loop of improvement. Otherwise it seems like it'd be just 
<br>
a glorified data-base, and would suffer from most of the difficulites that 
<br>
come from trying to reverse engineer aspects of the human brain.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, too bad he killed himself, I'd like to have seen research in the 
<br>
venue bear fruit.
