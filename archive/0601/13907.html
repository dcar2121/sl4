<p>You missed my point somewhat.  An AGI programmer would need no *more* 
<br>
knowledge of M-theory than they would get from Brian Greene, but they 
<br>
would need at least a couple of physics courses to (as you say) 
<br>
understand what thermodynamics (etc) was about, and what the scientific 
<br>
method was all about.
<br>
<p>But honestly, this entire thread is getting a little nonsensical.
<br>
<p>Are we talking about AGI programmers who are expected to invent new 
<br>
understanding of the problems?  Someone who can shape the way that 
<br>
future generations think about AGI design?  Someone who might be the 
<br>
Newton of AGI research?
<br>
<p>If that is the aim, the discussion becomes a joke.  That person will 
<br>
find you (if they can be bothered).
<br>
<p>And if not, then you we talking about people who either (a) could be 
<br>
hired by such a person to build a system of their design, or (b) could 
<br>
understand that person's ideas well enough to develop the ideas further 
<br>
and lead sub-teams to implement the design.
<br>
<p>Nobody seems clear which of these categories are being discussed.
<br>
<p>And, on top of that, the SIAI prescription (or the Eliezer prescription, 
<br>
to be more exact .... are these distinct?) is for a very particular 
<br>
approach to AGI design (heavily based in mathematics) that at least some 
<br>
people think is extremely unlikely to result in any kind of working AGI, 
<br>
regardless of who you hire to build it.
