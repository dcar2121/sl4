<em>&gt;   Fudley, you've defined in the past that anything either is random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or is not.  But there is no way for you to determine any method of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classifying something in your scheme, nothing.  As far as I can tell,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything reduces to randomness, which really seems to mean to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I don't know&quot;.  Quantum phenomena are not random.  They follow a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different class of rules than do classical systems.  People are using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these rules to construct a class of computers called Quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computers that aren't the least bit random.  True Randomness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpredictability, unintelligibility.  Here we can use Anthropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning to conclude the entire universe is not truly random.
</em><br>
<p>Everything that can be called an &quot;event&quot; or an &quot;observation&quot; happens
<br>
according to some probability distribution.  The distribution may range
<br>
from a delta function (only one outcome is possible) to a
<br>
maximum-entropy uniform distribution (what in layman's terms is
<br>
&quot;completely random&quot;).
<br>
<p>Anything which has a probability distribution with more than one
<br>
possible outcome is random, because you can construct a
<br>
uniformly-distributed random sequence from a long-enough series of any
<br>
such events.
<br>
<p>Quantum phenomena use probability distributions, and hence are random. 
<br>
Classical mechanics provides only one outcome for a problem (unless it
<br>
is unsolvable), and so is not random.
