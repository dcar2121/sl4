<p>
Phillip's solution seems functional enough to be a sustainable meta-ethic. I 
<br>
think the key to his solution lies in its evaluation of the mode of 
<br>
interaction, as well as the degree, frequency ect. Ethics as social codes have 
<br>
evolved in human societies to mitigate risks involved in our interactions. 
<br>
When new forms of interaction become possible there typically follows a phase 
<br>
transition where the old morality is challenged and re-figured, if not 
<br>
completely abandoned for a new worldview, as happened during the &quot;age of 
<br>
reason&quot; in Europe and early America.
<br>
<p>The point isn't that morals are relative and meaningless, though that 
<br>
sentiment could be taken, but rather that an increase in wealth and complexity 
<br>
of information (regarding both society and technology) generally facilitates 
<br>
the evolution of new, formerly impractical ethics. Taken to the logical 
<br>
extreme of the singularity, its possible that ethics may exist in increasingly 
<br>
diverse and transitory modes, and that a moralist/ethicists/theologian looking 
<br>
at a post-singularity civilization may see a mind-boggling version of Soddam 
<br>
and Gammorah, where &quot;do what you will&quot; is the only absolute dictem.
<br>
<p>The point, once again, is not: do what you will is the whole of the 
<br>
post-singularity law (to paraphrase Aliester Crowley). The point is that as 
<br>
information diversity/complexity increases the underlying ethical constraints 
<br>
of our behavior and thoughts will become increasingly transparent, facilitated 
<br>
by a bounty of relative perception.

<em>&gt;Fine, fine.  Here is the answer you are looking for.  The level of actual 
</em><br>
interaction a living organism should be permitted with other living organisms 
<br>
is proportional to how negatively the behaviour of the organism affects the 
<br>
contacted community.  A lion that can only kill gazelles should be restruicted 
<br>
to inert simulations of the killing.  A person who needs to kill for pleasure 
<br>
should similiarly restricted to fulfilling this desire in a holodeck world or 
<br>
with nervous system implants.  If you can't play nice, you have to sit in a 
<br>
corner, so to speak.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This system works as long as resources don't become scarce.  That shouldn't 
</em><br>
become an issue for a long time.
