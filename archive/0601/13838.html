When I saw the subject line, I immediately thought of a bumper sticker 
<br>
reading &quot;Great Old One or Bust&quot;.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular as a seed/raw material?
</em><br>
<p>Even the Eliezer of 1996, who knew so much less than I as to constitute 
<br>
perhaps a different person, knew the answer to that.
<br>
<p>1:  A finite computer has only a finite number of possible states.  In 
<br>
the long run, then, you *must* either die (not do any processing past a 
<br>
finite number of operations), go into an infinite loop (also implying no 
<br>
further processing), or grow beyond any finite bound.  Those are your 
<br>
only three options, no matter the physics.  Being human forever isn't on 
<br>
the list.  That is not a moral judgment, it's an unarguable mathematical 
<br>
fact.  In the long run - the really long run - humanity isn't an option.
<br>
<p>2:  The Eliezer of 1996 exists woven into the *now* of 1996, where he 
<br>
belongs.  There is no need for him to exist in 2006 also.  It would be 
<br>
redundant.  If my worldline were a purely constant state, I would not 
<br>
call that immortality, but death, the cessation of processing.  Not all 
<br>
change is life, but all life is change.  Where do you draw the line 
<br>
between moment-to-moment neural updates and death?  How do you say that 
<br>
your self of 1996 has died, but your self of five seconds ago has not?
<br>
<p>3:  There ought to be more to the choice to live, than being afraid of 
<br>
dying.  It should involve wanting to do certain things, and having fun, 
<br>
and learning is part of the fun.  If you keep on learning, and you keep 
<br>
on growing stronger, sooner or later you must end up as a Great Old One. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that isn't even my point.  My point is that I cannot &quot;want&quot; to 
<br>
live forever.  My finite brain is not large enough to want an infinite 
<br>
number of things.  My desire for life, as opposed to my fear of death, 
<br>
can only extend as far into the future as my mortal eyes can see.  And 
<br>
of course I anticipate that when I have lived one more week, one more 
<br>
year, one more century, I will find new things to desire, and so desire 
<br>
again to live one more week.  In that sense I will want to live forever, 
<br>
by induction on the positive integers.  But my desire to be something 
<br>
roughly similar to the Eliezer of today, is also finite, and can only 
<br>
extend for so far as today's Eliezer wants to do particular things (in a 
<br>
state of mind roughly similar to the Eliezer of today, so that it counts 
<br>
as &quot;me&quot; doing them).  When my future self acquires new desires and wants 
<br>
to do new things, I will want to do them while being roughly similar to 
<br>
the Eliezer of that day, not similar to the Eliezer of 2006.
<br>
<p>So thee wishes not to be a Great Old One, Russell Wallace?  I should 
<br>
like to know what is thy alternative.
