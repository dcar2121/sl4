<p>Yes, I thought so.

<p>For some I'm sure those things are fun.  Do you intend sarcasm?  People 
<br>
differ on what is fun, and in social and ethical maturity.  To bring them 
<br>
around to your point of view requires more than sarcasm they may (or may 
<br>
not) get.

<p>Okay, seriously, what are the tests?

</em><br>
<p>Your system of categorzation seems impoverished.  Good and bad, physical 
<br>
suffering and not, negative and postitive.  Most people do not view the 
<br>
universe in these limited terms.  Do you think your dichotomous views are 
<br>
better?  If so, why?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Of course a marathon runner needs to suffer and there are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>You seem to be saying that some categories of beings (marathon runners) need 
<br>
to suffer.  That seems a big concession considering you want to eliminate 
<br>
physical suffering from the universe.  Why are you making this exception? 
<br>
In what contexts is suffering &quot;fine&quot;?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But in the context of a gazelle, it does not need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be eaten by lions to be happy.  The lion to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happy can eat a mechanical gazelle covered by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same tissue growth process that will feed us all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a decade or two.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that gazelles can be happy without being eaten, and lions could very 
<br>
well be perfectly content eating mechanical gazelles.  However that 
<br>
situation is not an ecosystem.  And that's the point.  Your proposal would 
<br>
destroy the ecosystems of Earth in the name of eliminating the negative, 
<br>
therefore I am against it.
