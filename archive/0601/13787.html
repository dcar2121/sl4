<p>It does makes sense from a certain restricted point of view.  I also 
<br>
imagined this 'amendment' a number of years ago.  However, I was unable to 
<br>
find good arguments as to why this particular action should be taken rather 
<br>
than none.  I found poor arguments but no good ones.  It does need thinking 
<br>
about.
<br>
<p>The whole process of evolution, with its progress requiring the giga-deaths 
<br>
of living things, can appear horrific beyond description to those who look 
<br>
upon death as an unacceptable state.  And yet, that is how we have come into 
<br>
existence.  When it comes to be within humanity's power to end evolution on 
<br>
Earth, should we in fact do so?  Should we put an end to the process that 
<br>
produced us?
<br>
<p>My current best judgment is to answer: no.  Or perhaps, hell no!  Some of my 
<br>
arguments are laid out earlier in this thread, but additionally, there is 
<br>
something I find bothersome about the possibility of humanity imposing its 
<br>
will universally on every other living thing.  It appears a short-sighted 
<br>
action, something a child might do, or an obsessive.  I think we are smart 
<br>
enough to leave our options more open.  In fact, that is a significant part 
<br>
of what SIAI is about - opening options and keeping them open.
