It was really only one point.  Ok, several closely related points.  Ok, a
<br>
set of closely related whole points and a bounded subset of real points
<br>
combined to create the line segment AB.  And really the measure of AB was in
<br>
fact, quite short.
<br>
<p>Personally I feel it is a failure of language that so many words are
<br>
required to increase the likelihood that a thought is conveyed from brain A
<br>
to brain B.  The more complex the thought, the more lossy is language at
<br>
conveying it - so to ensure a quality transmission of an idea, a lower
<br>
transmission rate is required to cover all the preamble/overhead/checksum
<br>
overhead on both the sender and the receiver.  It's interesting to think
<br>
about this.  Once human wetware is running on improved hardware, it may
<br>
become possible to share ideas coherently and realize permutations similar
<br>
to the way XML is transformed via XSLT or HTML is styled with CSS.  Sorry if
<br>
that's not currently clear, my world involves these technologies so they are
<br>
available models.
<br>
<p>Is/was there already a thread about the mechanics of how thought is
<br>
generated and transmitted?
