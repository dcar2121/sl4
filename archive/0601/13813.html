Marc,
<br>
<p>I disagree with much of what you say in this thread, but I find that
<br>
your suggestion ties in interestingly with a prior thread on this
<br>
list, on Subjective Reality.
<br>
<p>Firstly, I think it is probably a non sequitur to say that the
<br>
universe is a formal system.  I find it more sensible to consider
<br>
formal systems as approximate and partial models of the universe.
<br>
<p>So, in my view, the universe is neither consistent nor inconsistent,
<br>
any more than a brick is either consistent or inconsistent.  There may
<br>
be mutually consistent or mutually inconsistent models of the
<br>
universe, or of a brick.
<br>
<p>The question you have raised, in this perspective, is whether the
<br>
&quot;best&quot; (in some useful sense) way of understanding the universe
<br>
involves constructing multiple mutually logically inconsistent models
<br>
of the universe.  You have suggested that this might be the case but
<br>
have (IMO) not presented any solid arguments in favor of your
<br>
contention.
<br>
<p>An alternative philosophical perspective is that, though the universe
<br>
is not in itself a formal system, the &quot;best&quot; way of understanding it
<br>
involves constructing more and more comprehensive and sophisticated
<br>
consistent formal systems, each one capturing more aspects of the
<br>
universe than the previous.  This is fairly close to being a
<br>
rephrasing of Charles S. Peirce's philosophy of science.
<br>
<p>It seems nice to refer to these two perspectives as Inconsistent
<br>
versus Consistentist views of the universe.  (Being clear however that
<br>
the inconsistency and consistency refer to models of the universe
<br>
rather than the universe itself.)
<br>
<p>Potentially the Inconsistentist perspective ties in with a previous
<br>
thread on this list regarding the notion of Subjective Reality.  It
<br>
could be that, properly formalized, the two models
<br>
<p>A) The universe is fundamentally subjective, and the apparently
<br>
objective world is constructed out of a mind's experience
<br>
<p>B) The universe is fundamentally objective and physical, and the
<br>
apparently subjective world is constructed out of physical structures
<br>
and dynamics
<br>
<p>could be viewed as two
<br>
<p>* individually logically consistent
<br>
* mutually logically inconsistent
<br>
* separately useful
<br>
<p>models of the universe.  If so, this would be a concrete argument in
<br>
favor of the Inconsistentist philosophical perspective.

<em>&gt; &gt;I do not believe there is such a thing as a partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent mathematical system. A system is either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent or inconsistent, and if it is inconsistent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *A* particular formal system has to be consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (because in an inconsistent system you can prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything), but my suggestion was that a full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of reality may require *several*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over-lapping formal systems.  Each system *in itself*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be consistent, but the different systems would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be fully consistent *with each other*.  An analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here would be a 3-D movie.  To get the 3-D effect two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different versions of a scene are shot - each version
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is shifted slightly in space (one version for each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye).  Each version of the scene is consistent in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself (left eye version or right eye version), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two versions are not fully consistent with each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other.  (Consider the two versions to be analogous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several formal systems).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;What he has said is that there is no a priori reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say you are wrong. There is also no reason to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are right. So why should we believe you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here are my reasons:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there's only one unitary mathematics which is fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent describing reality, then there appears to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be no way to explain the existence of mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself.  The trouble is that in a formal system which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is fully consistent and complete (and at least complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to include arithmetic) there are true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements that can be phrased in the language of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system which cannot be proved true within the system -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this of course follows from the Godel theorems.  So if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the formal system running reality was fully consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and complete then one would have no choice to conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there must exist an endless number of true axioms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (since for any number finite number of axioms there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be some true math statements which escaped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net - Godel).  So with a single formal system it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endless tower of turtles all the way down.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation as to *why* this system of mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existed could never be explained.  It would just have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be accepted as a brute fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now this to me seems to run contrary to the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method, which by its very nature assumes that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no unexplained supernatural brute facts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.  And mathematics itself is a part of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So a full explanation of reality should require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science to explain mathematics as well.  And as I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointed out, with a single formal system running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, this couldn't be done - there'd be an endless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tower of turtles all the way down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now if, however, we adopt my superficially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'unappealing' suggestion that reality as a whole is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent, the situation changes.  There would then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be several different over-lapping formal systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to fully describe reality.  *And each formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system could be used to provide an explanation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others*  Thus mathematics could 'explain itself' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there need be no endless unexplained tower of Godelian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turtles.  So you see, my suggestion is not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unappealing after all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Till shade is gone, till water is gone, into the shadow with teeth bared, screaming defiance with the last breath, to spit in Sightblinder's eye on the last day&quot;
</em><br>
