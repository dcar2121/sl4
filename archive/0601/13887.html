</em><br>
<p>After studying his blog, this is the best I can manage:
<br>
<p>He thought that the human brain is wired to index memories 
<br>
seven-dimensionally, seven dimensions being optimal &quot;because&quot; the 
<br>
hypersurface area of an n-sphere is maximized at n=7 (here I use the 
<br>
topological naming convention, in which n is the dimensionality of the 
<br>
surface, so a 7-sphere inhabits 8-dimensional space). The seven dimensions 
<br>
correspond to the states of the six cortical layers and of the thalamus.
<br>
<p>Mathematically, he then proposes a decomposition of local coordinates on the 
<br>
7-sphere (via the &quot;quaternionic Hopf bundle&quot;) into a 4-sphere and a 
<br>
3-sphere. The first four coordinates are to be used for space-time indexing 
<br>
by the hippocampus, the last three coordinates are to be used by the 
<br>
amygdala for indexing according to Wilhelm Wundt's three dimensions of 
<br>
emotion (pleasure, arousal, dominance, in Mehrabian's recent formulation).
<br>
<p>I have been unable to motivate the focus on n-spheres to my own 
<br>
satisfaction, but some adaptation of Douglas Matzke's &quot;corob theory&quot; *might* 
<br>
do it. Matzke talks about using random points in a high-dimensional 
<br>
hypercube as naming tokens; the higher the dimensionality, the better their 
<br>
properties from the perspective of error correction (greater spread, more 
<br>
uniform spread). *If* you were restricted to using uniformly normalized 
<br>
vectors drawn from a Euclidean space, you *might* find that unit 8-vectors 
<br>
(which form a 7-sphere) are optimal for a similar reason. But I cannot see 
<br>
that McKinstry himself made this argument anywhere.
<br>
<p>Also, if one were combining the states of seven disjoint brain subsystems to 
<br>
define an abstract state space, you'd think that the appropriate way to 
<br>
combine them would be via Cartesian product, but that would produce the 
<br>
Euclidean space R^7, not the hypersphere S^7. I might be able to contrive 
<br>
some further way to save McKinstry's hypothesis of optimality, utilizing 
<br>
coordinate maps which are locally R^7, but I leave that as an exercise for 
<br>
the newly formed McKinstry Institute (see the Wikipedia page). For the sake 
<br>
of completeness, I'll also note that while McKinstry started out wanting to 
<br>
apply hyperspace geometry to abstract state spaces (common enough, even in 
<br>
AI; see &quot;VC dimension&quot;), in his final year he became interested in the 
<br>
*physical* hyperspaces of string theory, where Hopf maps really have found 
<br>
some application, so evidently he started thinking about this space of 
<br>
representational states as being encoded in fundamental physical variables.
<br>
<p>And how does this relate to his AI enterprise, the Mindpixel Project? 
<br>
Mindpixel had accumulated a list of thousands of propositions, the 
<br>
&quot;mindpixels&quot;, which were to be a sample of the space of all possible 
<br>
thoughts, and indexed by a single parameter, consensus probability of truth. 
<br>
(He started using Google query probability as a ranking parameter at the 
<br>
end.) I think that eventually he wanted to devise a seven-dimensional 
<br>
indexing system as interface to his archive of mindpixels, along the lines 
<br>
of his brain theory, which would then be a component of an AGI.
