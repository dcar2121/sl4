<p><p>Sorry, I was half asleep when I wrote my last reply to this; I think it
<br>
needs a more considered reply, which I'll try now.
<br>
<p>First, let's separate out the issues.
<br>
<p>Child abuse (rarely by the archetypal stalker, more commonly by mothers'
<br>
boyfriends, peers and government and church authority figures) is a real
<br>
problem. There are ways to address it, which have nothing to do with
<br>
technology, much less artificial intelligence, and everything to do with the
<br>
use of human intelligence to look dispassionately at the real causes and
<br>
statistics and work from there. However, this isn't even close to being on
<br>
topic for this list, so I'll refrain from further discussion of it here.
<br>
<p>&quot;A witch cursed my crops!&quot; &quot;The Jews are conspiring with the bolsheviks!&quot;
<br>
&quot;My co-worker is a communist!&quot; &quot;Children will be molested unless Big Brother
<br>
watches and controls everyone!&quot; History is full of cases of mass hysteria
<br>
whipped up and encouraged by authority figures for their own purposes; human
<br>
psychology appears to be sadly vulnerable to this sort of thing.
<br>
<p>Then of course we get projection behavior. Folklore is full of stories about
<br>
fairies cursing people. The modern fairies (aliens in flying saucers) were
<br>
abducting and brainwashing people in the paranoid 1950s; then they were
<br>
preaching New Age fluff when that was in vogue; we're seeing more abduction
<br>
and brainwashing popping up now that we're back to being paranoid.
<br>
<p>And on to AI, which is on topic for this list. But let us try to keep
<br>
separate the real challenge posed by Friendly AI (which involves among other
<br>
things mathematics, computer science and moral philosophy) from the use of
<br>
the concept to project the currently prominent form of mass hysteria (which
<br>
is a matter of politics and psychology). AI will have its limitations, like
<br>
everything else that must work in the real universe; but there is nothing in
<br>
the logic of the problem that requires it to inherit those forms of paranoid
<br>
irrationality peculiar to the human mind.
