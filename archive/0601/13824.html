<p>
The thread view (identity is a verb, a continuing thread of consciousness)
<br>
and the pattern view (identity is an adjective; as John Clark put it, &quot;I am
<br>
the way matter behaves when it is organized in a Johnclarkian way&quot;) give the
<br>
same results most of the time; the one scenario that always gets adherents
<br>
of the two arguing with each other is destructive scan uploading (fine by
<br>
the pattern view, semelparous suicide by the identity view). (Happily,
<br>
gradual uploading is a potential way around this problem for the thread
<br>
view.)
<br>
<p>Another scenario in which the two views might give different results is the
<br>
wish expressed by some transhumanists that can be summarized as &quot;when I grow
<br>
up I want to be a Great Old One&quot;; that is, over the next while - say, a
<br>
million subjective years - they want to continually modify and augment
<br>
themselves such that the result will be, as they see it, as far beyond the
<br>
original as the original was beyond an amoeba. (I don't personally accept
<br>
the analogy even given the premises, but it gets the point across nicely
<br>
enough that I did happily make use of it for science fiction purposes.)
<br>
<p>To me, as a subscriber to the pattern view, this doesn't make sense because
<br>
said entity wouldn't be me anymore, so it would be a form of suicide; one
<br>
could still regard the future existence of such an entity as a cool thing,
<br>
but why would one have a desire to use oneself in particular as a seed/raw
<br>
material?
<br>
<p>But it occurs to me that it makes perfect sense from the thread viewpoint;
<br>
with appropriate care (don't discard so much that the result, while
<br>
incredibly intelligent, no longer has any feeling or awareness so that it
<br>
isn't anyone, etc) a huge change could be done as a series of incremental
<br>
steps, each small enough that the thread of consciousness was unbroken; so a
<br>
subscriber to this view could reasonably believe a Great Old One _would_ be
<br>
them, if it came into existence by the right path.
<br>
<p>One should then desire to follow this path if and only if one believes
<br>
gradual uploading is better than destructive scan uploading. I'm curious as
<br>
to how many positive and negative examples of this theory there are?
<br>
<p>(Meta: This is an SL3-4 topic, which people on the SL4 list have been
<br>
unhappy about the shortage of lately; it's also I believe on-topic for
<br>
extropy-chat, and is something of a followup to a previous (lower SL)
<br>
message I posted there, so it seems appropriate for both lists; if the
<br>
moderators of one or both lists disagree, or if crossposting like this isn't
<br>
the right way to go about it, please let me know.)
<br>
