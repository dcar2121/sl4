<p>
Here's another idea that's SL2 or 3, phrased (as these things used to
<br>
be up through the 1950s) as an entry from a future textbook:
<br>
<p>&quot;... These calls for the application of rights even to humans ignore a
<br>
basic important fact of human psychology:  They are , uniquely, the
<br>
only &quot;intelligent&quot; organisms with no consciousness.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is because of their peculiar serial form of communication.  Less
<br>
intelligent organisms perceive the world in a gestalt manner that
<br>
enables conscious reflection.  More intelligent organisms develop means
<br>
of communicating these gestalts to each other in a way that preserves
<br>
the topology of interrelations between perceptions.
<br>
<p>&quot;Humans, however, use a spoken language, which requires taking any
<br>
thought to be communicated and linearizing it.  This destroys almost
<br>
all of the relationships contained in a network of ideas, which must be
<br>
painfully, and inaccurately, reconstructed by the recipient, through a
<br>
combination of inference and of back-pointers embedded in the
<br>
communication.  Although complex ideas could be linearized, few humans
<br>
are capable of reconstructing the original idea structure accurately. 
<br>
More importantly, humans adapted even their inner mental life to this
<br>
linear mode of thought.  Many believed that thinking could be done only
<br>
in linear terms.  The mental life of a socialized human, as far as we
<br>
can tell, perceives and processes everything in this linear fashion
<br>
that cannot be said to be conscious.
<br>
<p>&quot;Nothing can be truly understood or even perceived by such a mind. 
<br>
Inconsistencies between different parts of a linearized concept are
<br>
difficult to detect.  The fact that humans alone are not truly
<br>
conscious explains why humans alone, of all species, are periodically
<br>
overtaken by collective madness, such as the witch hunts and religious
<br>
wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, or the nationalist and
<br>
communist movements of the 20th century.&quot;
