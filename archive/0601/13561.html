<em>&gt; After reading the conversation on sl4 and other forums, I contacted the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chairman of the PIBOT company (Rick Geniale Enterprises) who were listed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participants at the 2005 Accelerating Change conference at Stanford, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requested a private presentation of PIBOT for my group.  The response was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional in nature, in sharp contrast to the website, and they were willing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to schedule a demonstration in early June, and suggested that an Italian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translator would be handy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was wondering if any members of this list were at the 2005 Acc. Change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conference and may have had the opportunity to meet or hear from Messrs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bertini and Melonaro about PIBOT.  I'm highly skeptical, but if there in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an Italian team willing to set up private demonstrations later this year,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed by public conferences in Toulouse, Oslo, and Tokyo, then I'm willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep an open mind and invite them to explain themselves in a clearer manner than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one finds on their website.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What about we set up a conference call with them and ask some technical 
<br>
questions?  Should be possible to ask questions of a general nature that 
<br>
do not compromise their IP, but which at the same time reveal whether or 
<br>
not they actually understand the field well enough to do what they claim 
<br>
to have done.
<br>
<p>Your cautious response prompted me to go back to their website for a 
<br>
second look.  I'm sorry: to anyone with any appreciation for the 
<br>
complexity of intelligent systems, the claims made there are just plain 
<br>
silly.  &quot;Ontological representations&quot;?  &quot;N-level ontological 
<br>
meta-architecture&quot;?  Oh dear.
<br>
<p>Let me try to translate it to another domain.  It would be as if someone 
<br>
popped up and claimed to have a computer that could (a) run a 
<br>
corporation of any size, without needing more than a few minutes to 
<br>
familiarize itself with operating procedures, (b) babysit a one-day old 
<br>
child while the parents take a two-week vacation and, hey, don't worry 
<br>
about that baby for even a moment, folks, (c) argue every legal case in 
<br>
America simultaneously and guarantee to win every single one of them or 
<br>
it will pay all the awards that would have been won had every one 
<br>
succeeded, (d) it will contract to supply any guy, no matter how ugly 
<br>
and stupid, with a lifetime commitment from the hungriest, most gorgeous 
<br>
she-vixen on the planet, guaranteed or a thousand times his money back, 
<br>
(e) it will be able to start a war with any country in the world and win 
<br>
it in three weeks with no casualties and no loss of materiel, with the 
<br>
conquered populace cheering and singing in the streets forever after the 
<br>
invasion.
<br>
<p>People who make promises like that often do seem very professional on 
<br>
the phone.  But when you start asking them questions of a technical 
<br>
nature, the word output rate starts to go up, and they become strangely 
<br>
reluctant to give up their conversational turn, lest maybe you ask 
<br>
questions about the answer.  Analyse the stream of words afterwards and 
<br>
you will find it remarkably content-free.
<br>
<p>Hey ho.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
