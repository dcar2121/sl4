</em><br>
<p>You keep reframing the problem as if we're asking for fantastic,
<br>
elaborate evidence, at the limits of performance, with perfect
<br>
reliability. All it would take to satisfy critics is ANY effect that
<br>
is robust with regards to experimentation, at whatever success rate.
<br>
We do in fact grade creativity in art colleges, we have artistic exams
<br>
and criticism and reams of data on success on the US Advanced
<br>
Placement Art classes and exams in high schools, for example. The
<br>
correlations and relationships that we find there are useful enough
<br>
that we can teach people to be better artists, musicians, composers,
<br>
writers. Mushy, unpredictable, of course, but no one denies that they
<br>
exist, or that the educators and scientists studying it have not
<br>
identified useful trends and factors.
<br>
<p>You don't need to win the lottery, although if your claims were true,
<br>
you should have no problem doing so, albeit at significant effort,
<br>
which I explored in a previous post.
<br>
<p>You should be able to produce much more modest results very robustly.
<br>
An error-correcting code should be able to pick a specified digit
<br>
perfectly, with just a few thousand redundant guesses at the levels
<br>
that are claimed. That's opening the door for as ridiculously
<br>
uncertain a process as you need, iterated across as many retries as
<br>
you need, but still giving a certain answer.
<br>
<p>I admit that I don't know whether this has been tried or not. My
<br>
impression of the statistical juggling that occurs in psi research to
<br>
prove that something is happening *above chance* is that no one has
<br>
attempted to use cumulative statistics to extract more certain effects
<br>
from the 'above chance' results.
<br>
<p>My cynical take is that this is because the effects, however slight,
<br>
cannot actually be *grasped* to do anything, because they do not
<br>
exist, in a practical sense.
