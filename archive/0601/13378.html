Suppose a system exists in multiple states (ex: psi observed &amp; explained,
<br>
observed &amp; not explained, not observed)
<br>
If that system is affected by each researcher that becomes entangled with
<br>
it, then why can't we say that the involvement of a skeptic actually
<br>
influences the results?   Would anyone accept that the only way the research
<br>
is valid is if there are no &quot;non-believers&quot;?  This is completely counter to
<br>
the scientific method of testing a theory.  Maybe psi is inherently
<br>
undetectable using this methodology.  Sailors used lodestones to determine
<br>
north-south bearing long before magnetism was proposed as the magic that
<br>
made them work.  Perhaps psi has a mechanism that we have not been able to
<br>
determine.  Perhaps it does not.
