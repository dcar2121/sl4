<br>
<p><em>&gt; we know to some degree how emotions work.  We know it really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has little if any to do with computation.
</em><br>
<p>That’s news to me, perhaps the article in Science where that was proved
<br>
got lost in the mail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We know it is a chemical hormonal process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Physical not computational. 
</em><br>
<p>Can you name computational process that is not physical? I can’t. I can
<br>
only name one physical process that is not computational, quantum
<br>
randomness. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everbody knows carbon is a more versatile element
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for chemical processes than is silicon.
</em><br>
<p>And silicon’s ability to form complex compounds has nothing to do with
<br>
the silicon in computer chips. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We're not seriously going to debate that hormones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are computational, are we? 
</em><br>
<p>I see nothing sacred in hormones, I don't see the slightest reason why
<br>
they or any neurotransmitter would be especially difficult to simulate
<br>
through computation, because chemical  
<br>
messengers are not a sign of sophisticated design on nature's part,
<br>
rather it's an example of Evolution's bungling. If you need to inhibit a
<br>
nearby neuron there are better ways of sending that signal then
<br>
launching a GABA molecule like a message in a bottle thrown into the sea
<br>
and waiting ages for it to diffuse to its random target.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I'm not interested in chemicals only the information they contain, I
<br>
want the information to get transmitted from cell to cell by best method
<br>
and few would send smoke signals if they had a fiber optic cable. The
<br>
information content in each molecular message must be tiny, just a few
<br>
bits because only about 60 neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine,
<br>
norepinephrine and GABA are known, even if the true number is 100 times
<br>
greater (or a million times for that matter) the information content of
<br>
each signal must be minute. Also, for the long range stuff, exactly
<br>
which neuron receives the signal can not be specified because it relies
<br>
on a random process, diffusion. The fact that it's slow as molasses  in
<br>
February does not add to its charm.                                      
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
If your job is delivering packages and all the packages are very small
<br>
and your boss doesn't care who you give them to as long as it's on the
<br>
correct continent and you have until the next ice age to get the work
<br>
done, then you don't have a very difficult profession. I see no reason
<br>
why simulating that anachronism  would present the slightest difficulty.
<br>
Artificial neurons could  
<br>
be made to release neurotransmitters as inefficiently as natural ones if
<br>
anybody really wanted to, but it would be pointless when there are much 
<br>
faster ways.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Electronics is inherently fast because its electrical signals are sent
<br>
by fast light electrons. The brain also uses some electrical signals,
<br>
but it doesn't use electrons, it uses ions to send signals, the most
<br>
important are chlorine and potassium. A chlorine ion is 65 thousand
<br>
times as heavy as an electron, a potassium ion is even heavier, if you
<br>
want to talk about gap
<br>
junctions, the ions they use are millions of times more massive than
<br>
electrons. There is no way to get around it, according to the
<br>
fundamental laws of physics, something that has a large mass will be
<br>
slow, very, very, slow. 
<br>
<p>The great strength biology has over present day electronics is in the
<br>
ability of one neuron to make thousands of connections of various
<br>
strengths with other neurons. However, I see absolutely nothing in the
<br>
fundamental laws of physics that prevents nano machines from doing the
<br>
same thing, or better and MUCH faster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We're not seriously going to suggest a person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made of legos can be sad, are we?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly. If a bunch of grey goo can be happy or sad if it is organized
<br>
in the correct way so can legos.
