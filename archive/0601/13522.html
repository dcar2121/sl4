</em><br>
<em>&gt; I looked at PIBOT.  Complete drivel.  English may not be his native
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language (I am guessing), but even so this is a claim with absolutely no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substance, and nothing in the writing to indicate that he knows what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is talking about.
</em><br>
<p><p>English isn't his native language, but that's not the problem; the site is
<br>
heavy on boasting while not even trying to present any technical content
<br>
beyond buzzwords. Maybe the guy has something, but I'll remain skeptical
<br>
until I see evidence to back up the boasts.
<br>
<p>People:  Does this happen frequently?  I mean, is there a sub-genre of
<br>
<em>&gt; people who claim that thay have done it, like this guy Rick Geniale?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe we should produce a list of sites that are obviously cuckoo, so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can avoid wasting our time reading them?
</em><br>
<p><p>This is only the second one I've seen (Arthur Murray being the first). For
<br>
whatever reason, physics rather than AI seems to be the big magnet for this
<br>
type of kookery, for which we may all (except of course the physicists!) be
<br>
thankful.
