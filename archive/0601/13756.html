Gazelles are mammals.  They experience physical pain and fear similiar to the way we humans do.  If we can substitute fake gazelles with printed tissues and carbon composite skeletons for the hunting pleasure of lions, we should.  You might have some basis if you were defending a spider's right to be eaten while mating or while giving birth, but we are talking mammals here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must we preserve eco-systems in which mammals suffer if a (cheap) solution can be found in which the same population of animals don't suffer?  Why must we preserve economic systems where people suffer?  The common-sense I speak of is the very simple fact that physical pain is bad.  Are you seriously questioning this?  It sounds to me like you are suggesting evolution-of-predator-species is a superior moral guide to follow than is utilitarianism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many resources we will have to artificially restrict post-singularity (so there won't be any &quot;eco-systems&quot; to speak of for these resources).  We can't have people making UFAI, time-machines, anti-matter bombs, MNT, screwing with the vacuum state of the local universe, etc.  If some energy resources of the future are deemed similarly untouchable because we may need them to harness even greater energy resources, we will retrict them too.

<p><em>&gt; There are ways to artificially push an ecology's energy requirements to a

</em><br>
<p>I don't think we &quot;should&quot;, but we know that &quot;we&quot; will, because that is
<br>
how ecosystems work. SOMEBODY is going to use those resources. 
<br>
Resources are never left lying around unused for long. I have been
<br>
trying to explain this to transhumanists for 15 years now. Why is
<br>
this so hard for transhumanists in particular to accept? I suppose
<br>
because they are infected with extropian memes that preach the joy of
<br>
expansion unsullied by any problems with conflicts or resource
<br>
contentions.
<br>
&lt;SNIP&gt;
<br>
&quot;Common-sense&quot; is different for humans than for lions. That is the problem.
