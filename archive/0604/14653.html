<p>
Richard,
<br>
<p>If you think that
<br>
<p><em>&gt;what is probably happening in STM is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are several thousand things in &quot;short term memory&quot; at any given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment,
</em><br>
<p>then either
<br>
<p>a) you are flat wrong, and making an assertion refuted by experimetns already,
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p>b) you are not defining STM in the same way as is standard in
<br>
cognitive psychology currently
<br>
<p>I assume that b) is probably the case...
<br>
<p>Now, this may be fine: perhaps, for example, your definition of STM may
<br>
correspond better to brain structure than the standard definition. 
<br>
The area of STM/working-memory/whatever-you-want-to-call-it is the
<br>
subject of plenty of debate in contemporary cog psych.
<br>
<p>But I would be curious for you to clarify exactly what your definition is...
<br>
<p>Please note, it is not obvious that a mind needs to have a rigid
<br>
STM/LTM distinction.  Novamente does not exactly have such a
<br>
distinction, though it has a couple different distinctions that are
<br>
somewhat related to this one.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
