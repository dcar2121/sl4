If human minds templated on a brain can select MWI universe threads, then we do ontologically have a limited degree of Free Will.  &quot;Describing the degree of uncertainty&quot; is another phrase for *potential* Free Will, assuming the uncertainty stems from genuine physical limits and not just our incomplete observational epistimology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can't some of the goals be non-evolvable?  No one should ever engineer a particle accelerator large enough (good fraction of a galaxy I think) to destablize the Space-Time vacuum.  That goal doesn't need to evolve.  I see AGI as progressively laying fixed boundary conditions that only evolve as our understanding of WMD engineering increases.  No need to ever allow people to make the mega Particle Accelerator.  We might want to keep black hole experiments/science out of bounds for now, but later on open it up when we are more technically robust.  Stagnation isn't that bad of an endgame if it is a happy plateau.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly with &quot;free-will&quot;. Certainly we can all speak of free-will
<br>
within the context of common human social interactions and it makes
<br>
sense. In fact our legal and judicial system, as well as
<br>
moral/ethical beliefs and behavior depend on it. However, just as
<br>
with the self, the closer one looks, the more it is apparent that
<br>
there is no ultimate free-will, and that all interactions can be
<br>
described precisely (including describing the degree of uncertaintly)
<br>
within a deterministic framework of explanation. In fact, if our
<br>
behavior were not deterministic, we would lose the &quot;free-will&quot;--the
<br>
ability to choose--that we do have.
<br>
&lt;SNIP&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Goals are always about controlling some (complex) parameter relative
<br>
to something else. Given a well-specified context, then we can
<br>
precisely define goals. Goals are necessary for an AGI, but I believe
<br>
they must evolve. Within an evolving model of an evolving environment,
<br>
to be invariant is to die.
