</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no reason to suppose that it would take such risks, and many,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many reasons why it would specifically not do the kind of risky stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we do:  if you look at all the societal and other pressures that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; side effects, you find that all the drivers behind those proessures come
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that the AI's goals might not be our goals.  At all.
<br>
Most people would say we haven't taken many outrageous risks in
<br>
settling America, and yet the number of wolves has declined by a
<br>
factor of as much as a thousand!  How did that happen?
<br>
<p>(Aside: It is worth asking whether a free AI or an AI controlled by
<br>
humans would be more dangerous.)
