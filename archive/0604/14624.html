</em><br>
<p>Tricky question.  I really only had in mind the former, but....
<br>
<p>The notion of an &quot;implicit&quot; goal is not all that clear, in the context. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the strong sense of implicit, it would be the result of processes 
<br>
that were not controlling or manipulating it or doing anything directly 
<br>
to set it .... it would be a slippery side-effect or emergent property.
<br>
<p>Thus, in the case of a trivial neural net that recognises patterns and 
<br>
classifies them into different categories:  if someone said that its 
<br>
&quot;goal&quot; was to find out which category each pattern belonged in, I would 
<br>
say that this is a trivial and almost meaningless use of the word goal. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you are pointing the finger at *this* usage of the word (and 
<br>
the old chestnut of the thermostat that has goals or beliefs), then I am 
<br>
100% with you when you say the concept is right up there with free will 
<br>
and the rest. (Was that what you meant?)
<br>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm being a bit slow here:  I never even thought that would 
<br>
be the issue.  I was only interested in full blown control systems for 
<br>
thinking creatures that can reason about the world and have 
<br>
conversations with you about goal systems -- *those* critters don't have 
<br>
simple, implicit motivational goal systems, they have massive, 
<br>
complicated mechanisms that govern how they behave, and lots of the 
<br>
stuff inside those mechanisms (though not by any means all of it) is 
<br>
explicit or accessible to the system or both.
