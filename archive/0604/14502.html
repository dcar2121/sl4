Human neural synchronizations are an entirely different class of phenomena than are the computer programming variety.  I cringe when I hear attempts to equate each neuron with a bit.  There is no computer programming equivalent to our amygdala.  There is no computer programming equivalent to the chemistry hardware our brains run off of.  There is no neural equivalent to computer software (the laying down of memories?!).  Computers don't utilize quantum effects.  Any quantum computers we can envision engineering seem to top out around 150-200 Q-bits.  Computers don't use chemistry, brains do.
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect a computer = brain approach might yield some clues to the way our minds integrate sensory info, but that it will quickly stall when the model encounters behaviours emerging from some of the deeper recesses of our minds.  Our brains are the most complex objects in the universe.  Computers are just giant abacuses.

believed that was significant without prior reason.

Talk is cheap. Use Yahoo! Messenger to make PC-to-Phone calls.  Great rates starting at 1&amp;cent;/min.
