<p>Better choose your coat tails more carefully....
<br>
<p>The argument that Phil was alluding to, when you unpack the fine 
<br>
details, is that several factors probably contribute to the level of 
<br>
intelligence, so chunk size might be completely the same in all known 
<br>
examples of (say) higher mammalian brains, but other factors are what 
<br>
distinguish them (like ability to articulate language sounds, etc).  So 
<br>
your statement that &quot;clearly working memory *is* a key intelligence 
<br>
component&quot; is manifestly false.  It might be important, but it might not 
<br>
be what distinguishes different mammalian brains.
<br>
<p>So the argument is that those other factors might have all been maxed 
<br>
out in the human brain, leaving us with only the chunk size as the 
<br>
limiting factor from here on out.  That was where Phil's argument picked 
<br>
up.  (I don't think this is correct, but that is not the point: his 
<br>
claim was coherent).
<br>
<p>Secondly, my phrase &quot;Scale unfortunately&quot; was a targeted understatement. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the critical number of chunks depends on factors like having total 
<br>
connectivity at several levels simultaneously, and if it interacts 
<br>
signal latency requirements across the brain, then the situation could 
<br>
be worse than exponential:  the factors involved might conspire to mean 
<br>
there is no solution to the design problem (for any signal transmission 
<br>
speed, compute speed, size of wires, etc) that gets you a number of 
<br>
chunks above a certain level.
<br>
<p>But these are only details of the arguments involved in backing up 
<br>
Phil's claim:  what I want to know is, why did his post deserve first an 
<br>
insulting, sarcastic reaction, and now this sycophantic followup, where 
<br>
it could instead have generated rational discussion?
