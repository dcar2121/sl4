<p>
Bob,
<br>
<p>Thanks for the thoughtful response.
<br>
<p>On some of your points I agree with (too much hype about stuff that 
<br>
turns out to be vapornology), but there is a core point that I think you 
<br>
are missing, that seems to undermine your main thesis.
<br>
<p>All previous technologies provided us with something that did not 
<br>
substantially change the nature of the discovery process itself.  A 
<br>
better steam shovel could never cause any individual creative genius to 
<br>
suddenly acquire the ability to invent things at ten, a hundred, or a 
<br>
thousand times the rate that she was inventing things before the steam 
<br>
shovel came along.
<br>
<p>Now, someone might say that this is what PCs and the internet are so 
<br>
good at:  they amplify our intelligence in such a way that a given 
<br>
inventor really could become brighter, more productive, etc.  ...... but 
<br>
actually I would still be on your side and argue against such a claim, 
<br>
because I think the enhancement (or amplification) is fairly marginal.
<br>
<p>BUT, now imagine that I succeed in building the combination of hardware 
<br>
and software that I call a &quot;Discovery Engine&quot;:  a machine that is smart 
<br>
enough to understand the world by itself and invent new technology and 
<br>
make new discoveries (call it an &quot;AI&quot; if you like:  I like to make a 
<br>
distinction here, but that is not too important to the present point).
<br>
<p>If that discovery engine were to be built tomorrow, it would be &quot;used&quot; 
<br>
to build faster versions of itself, and those would be used to build 
<br>
faster versions of themselves, and so on in the familiar pattern that is 
<br>
the core thesis of the Singularity idea.  Within a short time, we would 
<br>
have systems that produced new inventions at a rate that would be 
<br>
thousands or millions of times faster than unaided human minds can achieve.
<br>
<p>A thousand times speedup would involve things like:  Einstein wakes up 
<br>
one morning with no knowledge of physics, then he does some reading and 
<br>
thinking, and by breakfast the next morning he has invented special and 
<br>
general relativity.  Or, a million discovery engines start working 
<br>
together on the problem of nanotechnology, and a year later they deliver 
<br>
a complete system for re-engineering the human body to make it immune to 
<br>
disease and effectively immortal.
<br>
<p>Now *that* is not business as usual.  For the first time, the technology 
<br>
changes the generator of new technology.  Never happened before.  Not 
<br>
just more of the same, but a whole new ball game.
<br>
<p>That is what the Singularity is all about, and why it makes no sense to 
<br>
say that new technology is not such a big deal.

<em>&gt; Sorry for coming into this discussion late in the game.  I'm the author 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the book Future Hype that got this started.  I've read your posts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with interest.  I'd like to add a few comments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, one small issue.  While I appreciate Robin's forwarding my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original email, of course, I don't think it was actually spam.  Robin, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you and I exchanged emails about five years ago on a Lojban vocabulary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; training program that I'd written.  Still, it's understandable that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've forgotten.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for the comments that have gone back and forth, I have gotten a bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this in other circles.  That is, some people say, &quot;This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *completely* off base!&quot; while others say &quot;But it does present some valid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerns.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A couple of postings suggest that my comments (sound bites?) are too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme.  Touche!  There are some places (more on the web site than in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the book) where I succumb to marketing needs/desires and use too much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marketing hyperbole.  That's a bit embarassing in front of, not a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumer audience, but a technically-aware one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm clearly going to be at odds with anyone who takes an extreme 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the-Singularity-is-near position.  Given that inherent challenge, let me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elaborate on where I'm coming from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the topic of &quot;the Internet and PC are not that big a deal.&quot;  Sure, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Internet and PC unprecedented -- but that's true for every other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major technology that's come before.  We've never had the kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communications ability that the Internet gives us.  But we never before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had the kind of transportation ability that the jet airplane gave us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (1950s), or, before that, the railroad (1850s).  The skyscraper and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other big civil engineering projects had their heyday in the early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1900s.  The transition from information as cargo to information as data 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came with the telegraph -- *that* was a big deal.  And keep in mind that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wasn't the Internet that brought information to the masses, it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fast steam printing presses of the early 1800s.  (Micah Glasser's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4/13 post had an excellent list of prior art that puts the Internet and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PC in perspective.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exponential curves were mentioned.  On this topic, let's talk about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moore's Law.  Truly amazing.  And yet, the increases at the low level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a hard time percolating up to the user level.  A PC that's twice as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast as the one you have now won't make you twice as productive (unless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have an unusual application that's compute-bound).  A PC that's a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *hundred* times faster won't even make you twice as productive.  And yet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at something as mundane as a dump truck.  You double the primary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specification, its capacity, and you double the productivity of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operator.  Construction equipment, farming equipment, factory machines 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- they all work this way.  If only the PC did the same ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One other pitfall we need to avoid is when we compare today's technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marvels vs. those of some previous period.  With all the hype we see in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the press and from tech companies, it's easy to put into the &quot;Today's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technology&quot; bin not only things like PCs and the Internet, which are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed causing much change today, but also all the stuff on the cover of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Popular Science -- that is, things that are still in the lab.  These 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be technologies like nanotech, biotech, electronic paper, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hydrogen economy, and so on.  It's not a fair comparison if we pad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today's technology with stuff that *might* make it.  (I don't need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell you of the long list of promised technology that didn't materialize 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as promised -- videophone, fusion power, moon bases, AI, home robots, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal flying vehicles, and so on.  Sorry to have to break it to you, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but all those cool technologies in the lab are *not* inevitable.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think this is going to have you and me holding hands and singing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kumbaya, but hopefully you have a bit more information of what I'm saying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bob
