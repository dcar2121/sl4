</em><br>
<p>For at least some class of problems (finding solutions that solve
<br>
large sets of constraints, e.g. in Sudoku) I imagine there's a
<br>
tradeoff between chunking and blind searching. E.g. if you can only
<br>
hold four constraint chunks, and the solution is obvious with 5, you
<br>
can load the four constraints into working memory and then run
<br>
incrementally over the search space until you see the solution that
<br>
satisfies the fifth.
