I've often thought about this issue and have had serious questions regarding
<br>
the possibility of 'uploading' because of it. This question, of course, is
<br>
nothing new. Philosophers have been discussing what constitutes identity and
<br>
the continuity of ego/consciousness since at least Descartes. John Locke
<br>
offers a particularly good discussion of it and, in more recent times, John
<br>
Searle has discussed thought experiments in which he asks what would happen
<br>
if parts of the brain were slowly replaced with  artificial hardware. Also
<br>
Edmund Husserl spent his entire genius inspired life grappling with
<br>
questions of ego continuity and the nature of subjectivity.
<br>
For my part I think I have come to a conclusion about what would happen
<br>
given the validity of certain presuppositions. If we presuppose the
<br>
functionalist theory of mind (which stipulates that the kind of hardware
<br>
that runs the algorithms of mind is irrelevant), and if we presuppose that
<br>
there is such a thing as a conscious ego that experiences a continuity of
<br>
identity in time, then I think the following argument can be made:
<br>
If an exact replication of a humans nervous system was reproduced (either
<br>
physically or virtually) including all memories and every last nuance of
<br>
function then for a single moment there would be two identical individuals.
<br>
But not really because the very moment there existed two identical
<br>
individuals (which is, of course, a logical impossibility) there would be
<br>
two individuals who shared a common past yet now had different memories (and
<br>
subsequently different brain structures making them disernible) beginning at
<br>
the point at which the two individuals diverged. So the conclusion to be
<br>
drawn from this is that if an exact replication of a mind was fabricated or
<br>
precisely simulated then there would be two different individuals who share
<br>
an ego identity past yet were now two distinct beings. I don't think there
<br>
is any contradiction inherent in this. But if the original mind was
<br>
destroyed at the moment of replication/divergence then the remaining
<br>
individual would still be a legitimate ego heir, so to speak, which would
<br>
experience a continuity of ego identity and could be said to be the same
<br>
person that previously existed in another form.
<br>
Of course one may argue against my original premises and there is certainly
<br>
room for debate there, but I would argue that given the validity of the
<br>
premises the argument I present is logically valid.
<br>
I tend to think that the most questionable aspect of uploading is the
<br>
assumption that consciousness (or qualia if you prefer) is something that
<br>
necessarily emerges from the patterns of certain physical substrate
<br>
processes and cybernetics. I think it likely that consciousness does emerge
<br>
in this manner but it is an assumption that could be wrong.
