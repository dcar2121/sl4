</em><br>
<p>I am not aware that any mind can or could &quot;select MWI universe threads.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Describing the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of uncertainty&quot; is another phrase for *potential* Free Will, assuming the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty stems from genuine physical limits and not just our incomplete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observational epistimology.
</em><br>
<p>The very useful illusion of free-will is a result of our uncertainty
<br>
over our own choices, but I was referring to something else, which was
<br>
our capability in the context of science or engineering to objectively
<br>
quantify the uncertainty of a hypothetical measurement.
<br>
<p>I don't know why you are trying to differentiate between physical
<br>
measurment uncertaintly and &quot;incomplete observational epistemology&quot;
<br>
which seems to mean &quot;incomplete understanding of what is being
<br>
observed.&quot;  It seems to me that a single uncertaintly value would
<br>
suffice, encompassing all factors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why can't some of the goals be non-evolvable?  No one should ever engineer a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle accelerator large enough (good fraction of a galaxy I think) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destablize the Space-Time vacuum.  That goal doesn't need to evolve.
</em><br>
<p>For all practical purposes, a particular goal in itself needn't
<br>
necessarily change during the lifetime of an agent.  Keep in mind,
<br>
however, that for interesting goals, the context is likely to change
<br>
as the agent and its environment develop.  A goal entails controlling
<br>
some measurement relative to something else, and while the goal can
<br>
remain constant, it's not likely that the world will.  Note also that
<br>
goals don't exist in isolation, any interesting goal will be tangled
<br>
with mutiple other considerations.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is a fundamental problem with an agent
<br>
at time t setting goals to be accomplished by actions taken over a
<br>
significant future duration.  Unless the context of the task is very
<br>
well defined in advance, then there is significant risk of goal
<br>
becoming inaccurate or even irrelevant.  Better to execute based on
<br>
values-based principles that will send you in the desired direction
<br>
than to target an end point that may not be there, or may not be what
<br>
you thought it was, when you arrive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI as progressively laying fixed boundary conditions that only evolve as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our understanding of WMD engineering increases.  No need to ever allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to make the mega Particle Accelerator.  We might want to keep black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole experiments/science out of bounds for now, but later on open it up when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are more technically robust.
</em><br>
<p>Technology is an inherently double-edged sword, and knowledge tends to
<br>
ratchet only forward.  I see no evidence that prohibitions work over
<br>
the long term, but I do see that increasing awareness leads to
<br>
increasingly effective decision-making, so I recommend focusing on
<br>
methods of increasing awareness over increasing scope.  Note also that
<br>
increasing awareness tends to re-frame problems such that may become
<br>
non-problems or may become ammenable to unforseen solutions.  Trying
<br>
to halt progress is not the answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stagnation isn't that bad of an endgame if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a happy plateau.
</em><br>
<p>Happiness in humans is not a static process or condition.  It is the
<br>
systems's way of motivating progress toward goals.  We would do well
<br>
to choose our path forward wisely, and we may indeed find that
<br>
&quot;there's pleny of room at the bottom&quot;, but I think accepting
<br>
stagnation would be unacceptable to humanity.
