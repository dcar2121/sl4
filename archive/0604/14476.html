<p>
Perhaps this discussion has before been approached, in that case I
<br>
apologize. This is my first contribution to this mailing list and if
<br>
I've failed in anyway to meet the standards of your, quite
<br>
informative, list please do not hesitate to call me out.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter I bring up concerns itself with the concept of the
<br>
upload, or rather continued existence of an individual in the absence
<br>
of an original body, and of course a biological brain. Originally my
<br>
worry with the issue was the much discussed argument that merely a
<br>
copy of the individual's conscious would exist and that from the
<br>
ego-centric perspective of the original they would no longer exist. Of
<br>
course the copy would still believe itself to be the original
<br>
conscious entity, or at least be aware that it felt it was.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, hopefully I am not treading into the topic of something like
<br>
the soul, but rather an issue of continuity of consciousness from an
<br>
egoistic point of view. I'm aware that for all intents and purposes
<br>
the upload would in fact be the original individual in temperament,
<br>
experience and other individual traits, however this does not deflect
<br>
the problem that as the original ego I will still cease to exist if my
<br>
biological brain or body ceased to function, of course this is only
<br>
from my ego's point of view.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if there are no major issues with my logic above, though
<br>
I no doubt will find that assertion incorrect shortly, I purpose a
<br>
solution that would suit my own personal worries. As the human mind
<br>
becomes augmented by technology to greater degrees and specifically to
<br>
the point where some thought processes and cycles are offloaded to
<br>
non-biological brain components, a directed effort to push ego into
<br>
the realm of simulations and virtual existence can commence to the
<br>
point where one feels at home in both the virtual and physical worlds
<br>
as well as being able to shift focus between the two at will.
<br>
<p>Thanks for reading, sorry if it got to be a bit lengthy and comments
<br>
would be much appreciated of course.   -- Andrew Cann
