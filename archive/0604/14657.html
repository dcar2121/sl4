<p>
Bob,
<br>
<p>Just a couple of thoughts.
<br>
<p>1)  You make reference to previous technology, and to technology curves, 
<br>
but I (unlike people like Kurzweil) place very little credence in those 
<br>
curves, and on the previous history of predictions.  You cite &quot;the long 
<br>
history of failed technology predictions,&quot; but as I am sure you are 
<br>
aware, for every book that lists the failed predictions there are dozens 
<br>
of books that catalog the _negative_ predictions that turned out to be 
<br>
too pessimistic:  Arthur C Clarke's estimate for the first moon landing, 
<br>
the Wright brothers' pessimism a few months before they succeeded, and 
<br>
(my personal favorite):  Lee DeForest getting prosecuted for fraud 
<br>
because he said that radio transmission across the Atlantic would soon 
<br>
be possible..... and then later in life, himself dismissing television 
<br>
as virtually impossible.
<br>
<p>2)  To me, as someone working in the field, the failure of SHRDLU and 
<br>
Deep Blue to lead straight to AI is of no importance whatsoever.  You 
<br>
ask:  &quot;Who could look at [SHRDLU] and think that general natural 
<br>
language interaction with computers was not around the corner?&quot; and I 
<br>
say:  are you serious?  I admit that as an early student (c. 1980) I was 
<br>
impressed by SHRDLU, but it took only a couple of years' work in the 
<br>
area to reach the point where I realized this was a dead end, and all 
<br>
the other cognitive scientists around me said the same thing in personal 
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>Given what I know of the field, I think that what we are waiting for is 
<br>
a paradigm shift:  a change in the way we think about the problem, after 
<br>
which it will suddenly seem surprising and comical that we all thought 
<br>
it was so very difficult.  I think this could have happened already, 
<br>
back in the mid-1980s.  I think it could happen tomorrow (literally). 
<br>
My best guess (just because I like the fun of guessing and being right 
<br>
:-), not because I am fond of exact predictions) is that the 
<br>
breakthrough will come in the next five years or so.
<br>
<p><p><p>Overall, you couch your reply in interestingly evasive language.  You 
<br>
try to imagine the event I described as happening, at best, a lot 
<br>
further away in the future than we think...... but you avoid saying 
<br>
whether, *when* it actually occurs, it would be qualitatively different 
<br>
from all previous technology, for the precise reasons I gave.
<br>
<p>If I pressed you on this point, would you not agree that since this 
<br>
technology would change the fundamental nature of the technology 
<br>
generation process in the most extraordinary way, it would be completely 
<br>
different from all that came before it?

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; Subject: Re: Anti-singularity spam.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bob,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the thoughtful response.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On some of your points I agree with (too much hype about stuff that turns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to be vapornology), but there is a core point that I think you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; missing, that seems to undermine your main thesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All previous technologies provided us with something that did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially change the nature of the discovery process itself.  A better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steam shovel could never cause any individual creative genius to suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquire the ability to invent things at ten, a hundred, or a thousand times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rate that she was inventing things before the steam shovel came along.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, someone might say that this is what PCs and the internet are so good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at:  they amplify our intelligence in such a way that a given inventor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really could become brighter, more productive, etc.  ...... but actually I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still be on your side and argue against such a claim, because I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the enhancement (or amplification) is fairly marginal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BUT, now imagine that I succeed in building the combination of hardware and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software that I call a &quot;Discovery Engine&quot;:  a machine that is smart enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand the world by itself and invent new technology and make new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discoveries (call it an &quot;AI&quot; if you like:  I like to make a distinction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, but that is not too important to the present point).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that discovery engine were to be built tomorrow, it would be &quot;used&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build faster versions of itself, and those would be used to build faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt; versions of themselves, and so on in the familiar pattern that is the core
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thesis of the Singularity idea.  Within a short time, we would have systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that produced new inventions at a rate that would be thousands or millions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of times faster than unaided human minds can achieve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A thousand times speedup would involve things like:  Einstein wakes up one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning with no knowledge of physics, then he does some reading and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking, and by breakfast the next morning he has invented special and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general relativity.  Or, a million discovery engines start working together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the problem of nanotechnology, and a year later they deliver a complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system for re-engineering the human body to make it immune to disease and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively immortal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now *that* is not business as usual.  For the first time, the technology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes the generator of new technology.  Never happened before.  Not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of the same, but a whole new ball game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is what the Singularity is all about, and why it makes no sense to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that new technology is not such a big deal.
</em><br>
