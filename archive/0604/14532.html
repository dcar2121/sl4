</em><br>
<p>Is the natural world really that staticky?  Take away all the
<br>
electricity that we artificially pump into our environment, and it's
<br>
not that staticky.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another benefit, perhaps:  whereas an electrical signal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat passive and might therefore degrade with distance travelled,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the action potential is actively promoted by the energy locked up in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural fiber ... so it travels without loss of strength.
</em><br>
<p>This is a great advantage of voltage propagation through ion channels
<br>
over current through wires.  Every current-carrying wire has some
<br>
minimal level of resistance, so you lose signal strength over large
<br>
distances.  However, there wouldn't be a selection pressure for it in
<br>
the evolution of nervous systems.  Most neuronal axons are less than a
<br>
millimeter to a few centimeters.  In humans, the longest nerve is
<br>
about a meter.  But humans didn't evolve nervous systems first. 
<br>
Something more akin to flatworms did. They are only a few millimeters
<br>
long.  Signal strength loss wouldn't be an issue.
<br>
<p>The more likely reason why neurons are built the way they are is that
<br>
ions were readily available to be exploited by primitive organisms. 
<br>
Ionic gradients make electrical gradients.  Building a
<br>
current-carrying system takes too much planning.  You can't boostrap
<br>
your way to it. The fitness gradient to the finished product is not
<br>
smooth.  That's why carbon nanotubes never evolved in nature either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for having lots of neurotransmitters, it might turn out to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that this is a way to implement several different functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influences on the process of thinking.  For example:  allow the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do multiple relaxation along several dimensions simultaneously.  Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know if that is how they are used, but it is a possibility, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might work very well.
</em><br>
<p>Again, that can be done with receptors or wiring alone, if you want to
<br>
be parismonious.  The more likely reason is that each neuronal
<br>
subsystem evolved in response to environmental pressures
<br>
independently, randomly utilizing one particular molecule or another
<br>
as the transmitter.  Unfortunately, again no planning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bottom line:  might not be a good idea to second guess nature's designs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we're very sure we know exactly how the thing works.
</em><br>
<p>I'll do it anyway. ;-)
