<p>Hi,
<br>
<p>I assume you are familiar with game theory from the way you write. Have 
<br>
you read the things that exist in the intersection of morality and game 
<br>
theory, such as David Gauthier? The following link might provide some 
<br>
useful stuff for you. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/</a>
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Some other things that might be of interest include Karl Popper and then 
<br>
David Deutsch. If you haven't read the latter's Fabric of Reality, you 
<br>
might find it interesting. It probably doesn't contain a lot of new stuff 
<br>
for you, but it does put things together in a fresh and interesting way.
<br>
<p>I've been working through a lot of game theory and morality stuff in my 
<br>
past and have found that an approach that is very good for understanding 
<br>
things. 
<br>
<p>As you might know, there are people who believe that moral systems 
<br>
cannot be distinguished, because value propositions are claimed to be such 
<br>
that no natural thing that happens can justify, or refute them. This 
<br>
actually does not hold, if we require a moral system to describe both 
<br>
values (goals) and the means to get there. 
<br>
<p>One of the simple rules that David once suggested for determining goodness 
<br>
of such a moral system is to determine whether it succeeds by its own 
<br>
lights, i.e. do the means accomplish the ends that the moral system 
<br>
advocates. Note that this is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for 
<br>
a good moral system. We should be able to develop other good ways of 
<br>
critisizing moral systems and thus evolve our knowledge.
