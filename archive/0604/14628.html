The problem with treating values as evolutionary instead of objective, is that it is easy to get stuck in a broad low maximum.  MNT or AGI in service of Neocapitalism would be a dystopia.  Evolutionary urges can be sublimated.  I'm not saying that is easy or practical for present generations.  But in considering a world of the future, sufficiently mature systems of education, psychiatry, psychology and social safety nets can make evolutionary pressures negligible.  IN the long run the speed of light limits brain sizes to a few hundred km across (I think), so get used to ultimate limits to growth.

<br>
idealistic college-age save the world thinking. I need to work on
<br>
that, and consider whether it is even practical to convey properly in
<br>
email discussion format. Yes, I'm idealistic, but that doesn't mean
<br>
I'm naïve.
<br>
<p>Fundamentally, I'm saying that with regard to morality, evolutionary
<br>
selection prevails (and there's nothing intrinsically nice about that)
<br>
and I'm also saying that we have reached a level of development where
<br>
subjective agents can actively and intentionally contribute to the
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>I am also saying that commonly accepted metaethical theories based on
<br>
such ideas as &quot;greatest happiness/good for the greatest number&quot; or
<br>
Kant's categorical imperative, or the Golden Rule, or even &quot;First, do
<br>
no harm&quot; are all incomplete and fail to include or account for
<br>
evolutionary aspects.
<br>
<p>Very recently, work has begun exploring along the lines of social
<br>
darwinism and evolutionary ethics, but it seems to me (and my own
<br>
studies are far from complete) that they are missing, or at least not
<br>
giving proper emphasis to, the essential dual components of morality
<br>
in that it requires both an expanding subjective element (values) and
<br>
an expanding objective element (what works.)
<br>
<p>When I say &quot;increasingly shared values that work over increasing scope
<br>
are increasingly seen as good&quot;, that's shorthand for saying that:
<br>
<p>* Values are necessarily subjective, they require a &quot;Self&quot;.
<br>
* Values are necessarily local, they evolve through a process of
<br>
selection within a competitive environment.
<br>
* Values &quot;that work&quot; (in other words, persist and spread) are
<br>
necessarily considered good (within that local environment.)
<br>
* Values that work over increasing scope (of interactees, type of
<br>
interactions, and time) are necessarily seen as increasingly good
<br>
(within that local, but expanding environment.)
<br>
<p>So, for example, when we consider the conflicting values of Islam
<br>
versus the west, there is interaction between the two systems, there
<br>
is competition, and there is a *tendency* for the values that work
<br>
best over increasing scope to persist and grow. This can be seen as
<br>
competition at one level, and as cooperation and growth from a more
<br>
evolved level. Yes, there will most certainly be losers at one level,
<br>
but the tendency is toward a more effective system overall (for any
<br>
given environment.)
<br>
<p>On a very practical level, it concerns me when I see intelligent and
<br>
inquiring minds suggesting faith in concepts such as stagnant or
<br>
static happiness, moral decision-making based on some narrow, isolated
<br>
or extrapolated model of human values, democratic thinking that
<br>
assumes every agent's ideas have equal &quot;value&quot; without regard to
<br>
fitness, libertarian thinking that assumes that effective action can
<br>
be truly independent, and so on.
<br>
<p>For increasingly effective decision-making, leading to actions that
<br>
will be seen as increasingly good over increasing context, we need to
<br>
be increasingly aware of our subjective values and increasingly aware
<br>
of what increasingly objective principles apply to promoting our
<br>
evolving values into the future. It's all about evolutionary growth,
<br>
but we've just reached the point where we can play an intentional role
<br>
in the process.
<br>
<p>[If someone can suggest how to factor out the &quot;increasingly's&quot; without
<br>
losing the meaning of growth, I would like to know it.]
<br>
<p>We are now at the point where we have the technology to achieve
<br>
broader and more detailed awareness, based on human values, but
<br>
surpassing the capabilities of any individual human.
