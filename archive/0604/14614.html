<p>I don't think this is quite as simple as that. It is a different 
<br>
thing saying that do not make a goal of wiping out human life for the AI, 
<br>
or saying that make sure the AI has goals that prevent it from doing 
<br>
anything that accidentally wipes out human life. 
<br>
<p>Goal system only describes those things that the AI is trying to 
<br>
accomplish. Typically all actions taken have some unintended 
<br>
consequencies. Some of those we may foresee, some we don't. Same applies 
<br>
to an AI at least during the time it is still trying to figure out the 
<br>
world around it. 
<br>
<p>Making sure that the AI has all the necessary goals is not a simple, nor 
<br>
straightforward problem to solve. It is not enough for AI to have goals 
<br>
that are compatible with good outcomes, they should rule out bad outcomes. 
<br>
And the latter is much, much harder. And it is against this idea that 
<br>
comments on this list should be judgede rather than the believed ignorance 
<br>
of the idea that the designer gets to set the initial motivations for AI.
