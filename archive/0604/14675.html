</em><br>
<p>Yes, I thought about the same thing myself after writing the post. The way 
<br>
that I would describe it is as follows. 
<br>
<p>There have been inventions that have helped get more out of the potential 
<br>
that humans have for development. Some of them have helped terribly lot, 
<br>
such as printing press and the internet. Still, there is a limit to the 
<br>
pace of development when human brains are the sole inventors, because of 
<br>
the physical limits on how fast we can learn and communicate ideas from 
<br>
one person to another. All improvements in technology so far have only 
<br>
pushed us closer to the physical limit. 
<br>
<p>Now for example AGI, or enhancing human intelligence propose to push that 
<br>
limit a lot further and in that way they are truly different from anything 
<br>
that has ever happened. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From another view point they still are part of the same technology 
</em><br>
development that quickens the pace and 'compare' to other great 
<br>
inventions, even though they may end up quickening the pace far further 
<br>
than any invention in human history. [Actually one could call the 
<br>
'invention' of language a comparable 'invention', because it pushed the 
<br>
limits of development far further than would have been possible without 
<br>
it].
