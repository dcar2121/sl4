The thesis we are debating, I think, can best be summed up as: hype is a bad
<br>
thing because it leads to overvalued markets and &quot;waste investments&quot; ;
<br>
these, in turn, lead to a &quot;bust&quot; cycle and the bust cycle leads to social
<br>
and economic disruptions that are undesirable.
<br>
This thesis actually makes a lot of sense - especially if you're an Austrian
<br>
School kind of guy like myself.
<br>
So here's my Austrian School analysis:
<br>
We start with the subjective theory of value and methodological
<br>
individualism. According to this view something is only valuable if an
<br>
individual perceives that it is. Price would then follow from the aggregate
<br>
of this subjective perception of value in the marketplace. Now because
<br>
finance is merely a system for allocating capitol investment it is only a
<br>
good system if the aggregate of subjective perception of value is accurate
<br>
(otherwise those things that need investment most will not receive it).
<br>
Now we come to hype. Hype, as I now define it, is a meme complex that
<br>
spreads causing the subjective perception of value to be completely
<br>
inaccurate on a large scale. This is a bad thing because it makes the system
<br>
of capitol allocation inefficient. Thus the need for market transparency.
<br>
The more good information people have access to the better investment
<br>
decisions they can make.
<br>
This leads me to my theory about market cycles and their relationship to the
<br>
singularity. Because access to good information is a prerequisite to
<br>
avoiding the spread of hype, and hence the bust cycle; and because better
<br>
and better access to information is a quality of the evolution of the
<br>
economic infrastructure (which leads to technological singularity), we might
<br>
conclude that the business cycle is in a trend that causes each successive
<br>
business cycle to be less and less severe and of a shorter and shorter
<br>
duration.
<br>
Also, looking at this whole cycle in the greater scheme of things, one might
<br>
describe the market cycle phenomenon as but one aspect of the co-evolution
<br>
that has arisen in the biosphere between culture/memes and techo/economic
<br>
infrastructure. It doesn't surprise me at all to see that spontaneous order
<br>
is coming together out of the apparent chaos of human economic/technological
<br>
activity - such order is often observed coming out of a chaotic system and
<br>
this process is understood mathematically.
<br>
Sorry if I got too far off topic.

<em>&gt; I was not only talking about people flocking and using and enjoying stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Internet. I was also talking about people being paid to learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things like Java to do software engineering. In Finland at the bubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, people from all educations with practically no experience in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software engineering were pulled into companies to write code; to do other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff necessary for software engineering. People who in another kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world would never have learned to code one single line did because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bubble.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The result is that there's a lot more people with some skills making code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and most of those people are not experts and even particularly good. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have broken the barrier of transforming themselves into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic world (say SL0.5). Because of this, we have an entire extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation of people who got to the paradigm when they were young.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise, it would have taken another 5-15 years and my generation would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been mostly lost to the SL0.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The market did something that the public education systems could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adequately do. It trained people to the new industry. That is an asset
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the investors have no way of getting return on, it's the people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked in the industries who got all that benefit. The financial markets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did probably the biggest education campaign out of their pockets that has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever happened in the history of human civilization.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A good example of the same kind is from history of railroads. Britain was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practically the only country in the world that let people just build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; railroads without government interference. They experienced great booms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and great busts. Still they created much denser railroad network in a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster time than any other country in the world. Lots of over investment?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. But market based overinvestment has the nice quality that it tends to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look under every rock for profit. And thus also lots of good things get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invested in - things that people would definitely have overlooked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; diversity of stuff funded by it for both fun and profit generated a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of rapid evolution.  Sure, the Internet would have happened anyway, but
</em><br>

</em><br>
