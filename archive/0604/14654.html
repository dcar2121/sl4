</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what is probably happening in STM is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; there are several thousand things in &quot;short term memory&quot; at any given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; moment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) you are flat wrong, and making an assertion refuted by experimetns 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) you are not defining STM in the same way as is standard in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive psychology currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assume that b) is probably the case...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, this may be fine: perhaps, for example, your definition of STM may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspond better to brain structure than the standard definition. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area of STM/working-memory/whatever-you-want-to-call-it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject of plenty of debate in contemporary cog psych.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I would be curious for you to clarify exactly what your definition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please note, it is not obvious that a mind needs to have a rigid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; STM/LTM distinction.  Novamente does not exactly have such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction, though it has a couple different distinctions that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat related to this one.
</em><br>
<p>It is b), of course, but I don't think the literature is as clear cut as 
<br>
you suggest:  the presence of a large number of &quot;partially-activated&quot; 
<br>
concepts is what I have in mind, and although people do not normally 
<br>
refer to this as STM, the distinctions that *they* make between STM and 
<br>
whatever place these partial activations are situated is not so clear. 
<br>
They would like it to be LTM, but partialy activated, and I have 
<br>
(repeatedly) chalenged them to be clear about the whys and wherefores of 
<br>
that way of looking at it, without much success.
<br>
<p>I am stretching the concept of STM, but I am doing so in a way that most 
<br>
cognitive psychologists would not say is wrong, just open to 
<br>
interpretation.  They do not often want to get into a discussion about 
<br>
the distinction I am making here, because it is difficult for them to 
<br>
think of experiments to clarify the distinction, but if I take a &lt;let's 
<br>
build a system that actually works&quot;&gt; perspective, I find that this issue 
<br>
comes up immediately, whether or not they can address it experimentally.
