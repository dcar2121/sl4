</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's actually even worse (more extreme) than that...sometimes, e.g. when my

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something.  Somedays I can't understand things that I couldn't on other days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If what you say is true (and I have no opinion, though it sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausible)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think I have an opinion. It seems like, on problems that
<br>
are too complex for us to understand, we can actually make slow
<br>
progress on them. But each additional piece of information required to
<br>
understand the problem requires an exponential increase in the time
<br>
required to understand it. Because information can be made to &quot;shrink&quot;
<br>
so that we can fit more of it in our working memory. This is a major
<br>
function of all learning, and it applies to specific problems. It just
<br>
takes repeated exposure to the relevant ideas for them to become
<br>
habitual, more easily brought to mind, and more easily worked with.
<br>
<p>So on an issue you're not very familiar with, you might see what
<br>
Charles saw, that you can grasp it in its entirety when you're feeling
<br>
especially insightful, but that you're not practiced enough with the
<br>
concepts to bring them all to mind when you're feeling a bit slow. But
<br>
with additional familiarization, you'll be able to bring those
<br>
concepts to mind even at a diminished capacity.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, it could be that at some times one's capacity for any
<br>
rational abstract thought is very diminished, but it turns out we
<br>
don't really use that part of our minds as much as we think, so we
<br>
only notice it when we try to think about complicated problems.
<br>
Certainly, we use habitual neural pathways, and our unconscious mind,
<br>
for a lot more than we often realize.
