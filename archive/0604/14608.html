What about uncounscious (fulfilled automatically) goals which you can
<br>
articulate if you know about them. For example, breathing. You also
<br>
need a category for that. But I bet that there are already tons of
<br>
detailed studies about this.

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; to consider what it is they are actually talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Richard, this is a good point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Goal&quot;, like &quot;free will&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; or &quot;memory&quot;, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a crude abstraction that we use to describe certain aspects of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complex cognitive system (the human mind/brain), but that does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really fully describe these aspects correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An abstraction that some complex cognitive systems use as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; **ideal**, i.e. they try to modify themselves so as to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explicitly goal-oriented, never fully succeeding (at least in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; human case)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When I say that an AGI has certain goals, I don't necessarily mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the AGI is orienting all its actions toward these goals, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; * the statement that the AGI is &quot;pursuing&quot; these goals is a fair
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approximation of its behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; * the AGI is explicitly involved in an ongoing process of making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; itself more goal-oriented so that it can better achieve these goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which it explicitly conceptualizes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So let's begin to construct a better definition of what's happening here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the following distinctions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) There are explicit, self-conscious &quot;goals&quot; that the system sets for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself and that it can talk about easily when you ask it &quot;What are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing this morning?&quot;  [Answer: &quot;Well, my goal for this morning is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finish writing a paper.&quot;]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) There is the actual thing it is doing, which we might call a &quot;task
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal&quot; that is currently occupying the system's attention, which comes up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we ask &quot;What are you actually doing right now?&quot;  [Answer:  &quot;Okay, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I got distracted and so what I am actually doing right now is writing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message to reply to one of Ben's posts.&quot;]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) The above two points highlight the fact that the system can have many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of these goals hanging around, functioning on different timescales.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a work list that has a couple of hundred house-maintenance, house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; renovation and other tasks on it, but it impinges on my behavior in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various ways.  Even if these are goals that operate on a timescale of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, what makes them similar to other ones is that I can explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; articulate them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) Might there also be other goals that I cannot articulate because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work underneath the surface?  That I cannot articulate (even if my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therapist might be able to)?   This is difficult:  let's make a category
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this type of goal, even though I think in the end there may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any that belong in this category rather than in the next one..........
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) Motivations.  I would distinguish between these and goals.  Right now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am swayed in my behavior by some nebulous &quot;dispositions&quot; that I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to satisfy.  One is gustatory pleasure (I come to a coffee shop to work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where I can get a pot of tea to sip while I am writing).  One is human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company (the coffee shop has people in who I don't often interact with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but who have something I need, which is perhaps the sound of voices and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity).  One is the need to achieve something intellectual, or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a mark upon the world, or to be noticed by peers .... hence I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven to write a paper rather than just go dig the garden.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could list many other background motivations or drivers that I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribute to my decision to be here doing this, rather than other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things.  I think these are very different from explicit goals because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are (a) hard to articulate, and (b) primal, or out of my control.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not decide to want gustatory pleasure, I just want it.  The fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are hard to articulate means, in my theory of mind, that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not directly a part of the main area where all the explicit thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets done.  They impinge on this area, but are distinct from it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6) Motivations are not the end of the process, because there is a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that organizes the motivations.  I don't just let gustatory pleasure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drive me all day long, I wax and wane between the various motivations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are saturation and novelty seeking mechanisms at work here:  too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of one motivation starts to make me want to do something different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The interaction between the motivational system and the place where all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the contents-of-consciousness stuff goes on (the &quot;foreground,&quot; in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terminology) is of greatest interest to me.  It is not simply a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some motivation marching and putting an explicit goal on top of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal stack:  the motivational system is dumb, so it cannot know exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to do this.  There is a coupling between the two, but it is quite loose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How, for example, does a nine-month old child have an episode of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rebellious independence&quot; motivation when it does not yet have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts to put a &quot;rebel!&quot; goal on its goal stack and then try to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a plan of action that satisfies that goal?  I watched this happen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my son (and then watched and saw the character streak develope from that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point on, so it was real, that first time), and I find it fascinating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the motivation was there before the concepts that he could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to discuss it.  This is a very abstract example, I know, but it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cuts right to the heart of the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry for the ramble.  I'll turn it into a paper soon.  I especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to disect your own comments about how you see the significance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the term &quot;goals&quot;, which seems to be sort of operationalist or behaviorist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Sigh: another paper for the goal stack]
