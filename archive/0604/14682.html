Thomas: you talk about the folly (or excessive expense) of moon bases, 3D
<br>
TV, flying cars, and so on.  I agree.  And maybe you're able to see through
<br>
the hype of whatever today's equivalent is (I dunno -- manned mission to
<br>
Mars? hydrogen cars?).  
<br>
<p>What concerns me is the majority of the population that greets these new
<br>
predictions with, &quot;Wow -- that *does* sound pretty cool.  What an amazing
<br>
time we live in!&quot;  Their mental bin labeled &quot;Today's Technology&quot; contains
<br>
the PC, GPS, and Internet as well as nanotechnology, biotech, and most of
<br>
our energy coming from renewable sources since the press talks about all of
<br>
these.  As a result, they see the progress today as being much greater than
<br>
that in the past -- but only because &quot;Today's Technology&quot; has an unfair
<br>
advantage.

<p><em>&gt; IMO, the list of optimistic failures (moon bases, etc.) is much longer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the pessimistic failures (DeForest missing the impact of TV).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But perhaps we should just agree to disagree here.
</em><br>

<br>
For what on Earth, do you want to torture a few Lunonavts in a permanent
<br>
Moon base? Isn't already enough to have this ISS station in the orbit for no
<br>
good reason, except money loosing?
<br>
<p>I rather have a GSM in my pocket, than an uncontrollable AI in the orbit
<br>
around Jupiter. The negative list of un achievements of the past consist of
<br>
two parts. One is the list of impossibilities, the other is the list of &quot;too
<br>
expensive for now&quot; or &quot;too silly anyway&quot;.
<br>
<p>Don't you think, that a flying car is a silly thing, unless it is silent and
<br>
automated? Too expensive for now, if made the right way, silly otherwise. We
<br>
haven't contacted our cosmic brothers either, and I am glad we didn't.
<br>
<p>And sorry, you can't have a world from a &quot;optimistic&quot; SF book from 1960. In
<br>
reality, humans have other priorities than a 3D TV.
<br>
<p>The point is, that the negative list is not long at all, considering what is
<br>
possible and what isn't. What do we really want and what we are just saying
<br>
we want, but nobody really cares. As for the Moonbase, for example.
<br>
<p>The positive list of achievements is impressive. More and more atoms are
<br>
placed where we want them, with the ever increasing precision. What is the
<br>
only thing really matters. Can't act like a spoiled child, wanting a toy
<br>
which costs a fortune, worth nothing. Moonbase and such.
<br>
