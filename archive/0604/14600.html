On 4/24/06, Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Fwd:%20We%20Can%20Understand%20Anything,%20But%20are%20Just%20a%20Bit%20Slow">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt; I wouldn't go that far.  I would say that it sounds plausible to

</em><br>
<p>This is not necessarily the case. It could be so, if you assume that
<br>
there is indeed only an infinitesimal difference between us and
<br>
chimpanzees.
<br>
<p>OR, more plausibly, it could apply only to the boundary capabilities
<br>
of intelligence in general, where humans and chimpanzees represent
<br>
implementations nowhere near &quot;optimal&quot;, and thus can have vast
<br>
differences in 'performance' without conforming to the proportional
<br>
computational resource differential. Chimpanzees and Neandrathals
<br>
could very plausibly be simply missing architectural elements that
<br>
reduce computational cost for intelligent behavior.
<br>
<p>The problem with these kinds of arguments, is that the terms imported
<br>
from say, algorithm analysis, don't actually deal with any of the
<br>
interesting complexity of the issue. If linear increases in
<br>
intelligence can be assumed to be continous(continous how? relative to
<br>
what?) what is the relationship to computational cost? Well, what kind
<br>
of computational cost? Just running the mind? What about perception?
<br>
(we use a lot of neurons to see, some of those might be wasted towards
<br>
general intelligence) What about special analysis? What about just
<br>
sitting there thinking, or remembering?
<br>
<p>The whole thing strikes me as very blue-sky, either position. Although
<br>
Eliezer's joke was very funny, I don't think it was very illustrative.
