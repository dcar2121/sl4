&nbsp;&nbsp;No I'm saying they perform different functions.  Apparently I know a lot more about neuron behaviour than the rest of you.  :)

<p><em>&gt;Synchronization at its broadest abstraction has a pretty simple

</em><br>
<em>&gt;synchronization?
</em><br>
<p>It is quantum mechanical synchronization in the context of meatty neural nets.  No silicon computer corollary.  Biology not software.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;This statement makes little sense on a couple different levels. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature of the machinery is irrelevant to the software abstraction, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;except as an engineering detail. Without having any knowledge of the

</em><br>
<p>There are few if any computation fundamentals responsible for originating intelligent behaviour in humans.  Sure there are brain processes that can be mapped in computer code as computation, but that is misleading at best.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Computers don't use chemistry, brains do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You seem to think this statement is making some sort of distinction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that does not exist. Chemistry is not magic nor does it have special 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extra-computational properties, and I have never seen a chemistry- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free computer in any case.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Computers won't and don't use chemistry as their basic fundamental process in devising intelligent behaviour.  Human brains do.
<br>
<p><p><em>  &gt;Clearly this topic has overwhelmed your imagination and 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;everything to the Big Mystery In The Sky and leaving it at that. It 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No I'm trying to deprogram as best I can the absurd notion that consciousness is nothing more than an act of computation.  Moravec or Vinge or whoever first forwarded the idea, did so without a grounded understanding of neurochemistry or quantum mechanics.
