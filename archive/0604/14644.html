In some cases they were just trying to improve those truths. For 
<br>
example, Copernicus made his model because he was trying to improve the 
<br>
ptolemaic cosmology. He was unhappy about the lack of uniformity in the 
<br>
circular motion. Galileo didn't present any proof for his claims of the 
<br>
Earth mobility. It was not the case of not following any book, neither 
<br>
it was democratic, however, it was equally &quot;wrong&quot; in the method. Kepler 
<br>
did arrive to his results, coincidental through errors in his 
<br>
calculations. Just three main examples of the main characters in what 
<br>
was perhaps the most important revolution in science. Were they more 
<br>
awaken than those who arrive to the &quot;truth&quot; by the books or 
<br>
&quot;democratically&quot;?
