<p>The Enlightenment could perhaps be better characterized in the

opposite way.  It occurred in the context of societies that believed
<br>
they already knew all the important truths with absolute certainty. 
<br>
Enlightenment thinkers argued that  the agreed-upon truths were often
<br>
invalid.  They did believe in truth, but they were fighting against
<br>
two ways of arriving at truth - receiving it from a book, and arriving
<br>
at it &quot;democratically&quot; (though they didn't use that word) via common
<br>
consensus.  They might even have said that a truth that everyone
<br>
agreed on was inherently suspect.
