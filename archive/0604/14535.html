</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Not necessarily. Perhaps there's a threshold of intelligence required to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; qualitative from then on, at least as far as activity within this

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that this is not a priori improbable, even.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the Flynn effect and the amount of time since the industrial

<p>To me it appears that there is something analogous to stack depth that renders 
<br>
some concepts unintelligible to many people, even though some others can 
<br>
understand them.  This doesn't appear amenable to teaching or solvable 
<br>
through interest.  I'll grant that for many concepts this doesn't apply, but 
<br>
for some it appears to. 
<br>
<p>It's actually even worse (more extreme) than that...sometimes, e.g. when my 
<br>
allergies are acting up, I cannot understand thoughts that I had 
<br>
earlier...it's as if there is a step involved in processing that is a 
<br>
variable, and it must allow a certain depth of recursion or stack or 
<br>
something.  Somedays I can't understand things that I couldn't on other days.
