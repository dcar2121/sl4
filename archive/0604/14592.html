</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>As we all know, humans required thousands of much times as much brain 
<br>
tissue as chimpanzees to produce only a small increment in performance; 
<br>
if you look around on the street, you can easily see that each 
<br>
additional 10 IQ points requires a rough doubling of cranial volume.  If 
<br>
you still think the ascent of AIs will be rapid, a further caution is 
<br>
provided by the evolutionary history of the hominid family:  After 
<br>
requiring only 50,000 years to go from Australopithecus to late Homo 
<br>
erectus, it then required another five million years to produce Homo 
<br>
sapiens.  Most of what we think of as impressive benefits and major 
<br>
impacts of &quot;human&quot; intelligence, such as guns and nuclear weapons, were 
<br>
invented by monkeys twenty million years ago.  Our closest cousins, the 
<br>
chimpanzees, have most human abilities - including combinatorial 
<br>
language, machines with moving parts, and crude scientific journals - 
<br>
which also suggests that it is unlikely for any particular AI project to 
<br>
get many major abilities in advance of other AI projects.  The ongoing 
<br>
military and economic competition between Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals 
<br>
has stalemated for millennia; slight improvements in brainpower simply 
<br>
do not amount to all that much in the real world.
