Anyway, the point regarding the Singularity is not
<br>
<p>-- that the PC and Internet are such great innovations, in themselves
<br>
(IMO, in terms of their immediate impact, they are considerably lesser
<br>
innovations than printing presses or electricity)
<br>
<p>nor
<br>
<p>-- that one can draw exponential curves illustrating the development
<br>
of certain technologies
<br>
<p>The argument for the Singularity is that more radical technologies
<br>
like AGI, and powerful nanotech and genetic engineering are on their
<br>
way.  The exponential curves, and the power of PC's and the Internet,
<br>
are relevant to the Singularity only as part of the overall
<br>
qualitative argument.  What Kurzweil did in his book is to lay out the
<br>
qualitative argument in a straightforward and digestible way.  I think
<br>
that in his presentation, Kurzweil over-hypes the exponential curves
<br>
aspect, but even so, he does present the qualitative argument quite
<br>
competently.

<em>&gt; I think the problem with Seidensticker's Future Hype book is that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both ridiculous and, unfortunately, partly truthful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For him to dismiss the PC as just another invention (as in &quot;the Internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the PC are not that big a deal&quot;) is surely a mistake:  there are now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundreds of millions of people who, because they have a PC, have a tool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with which they could learn to program, then learn about AI, then figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out how to build an intelligence and then perhaps go on to trigger the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity.  If those same hundreds of millions possessed any of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other inventions below they would not be in that position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But on the other hand, if Seidensticker wants to point to stupidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overhyped technology, he is speaking words of wisdom.  The imaginary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; version of the internet that drove the investors into a feeding frenzy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the late 1990's was a complete fiction.  By itself, the internet was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good, but it was not *that* good.  There are a lot of details that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could argue about here, but my basic point is that the internet by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself (not the other things that might one day be facilitated by it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the direct thing in itself) was not something to get that worked up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about.  It was convenient for the Market, because the Market has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voracious need for (controlled) volatility, fresh blood and emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enthusiasm in order for the skillful players to make their killings, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the world in general it would have been better if the internet had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply developed at a regular pace and nobody threw a hundred billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars down the toilet trying to get rich on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And now, today, we are in Nanohype Land, of course:  there used to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valid and visionary thing called nanotechnology, but now we have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely redefined new thing that uses the same name but is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially just a convenient hook on which companies can hang some old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothes and snag some extra funding.  Plus ca change....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I find interesting to contemplate is how the Singularity Hype will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop in the near future.  How long before someone finds a way to cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in on the Singularity concept and milk the cash cows in order to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing whatsoever of any relevance to the real Singularity?  What form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will the hype take?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obvious and simple answer:  they will start announcing that they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built the world's first true AGI, or that they can do it with a million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollar grant, a year and a couple of research assistants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have already seen examples of this kind of announcement, and my best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess about all of them, so far, is that they are pure hype, cynically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to get investment and/or grants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I only wish that someone like Seidensticker could write a book debunking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the charlatans and hype mongers, whilst at the same time making a strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case for the potential of real technological breakthroughs.  Sigh!  Too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much to expect, I think.
