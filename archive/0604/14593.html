<em>&gt; &gt;My intuition, based on experience with how much computational

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Rescher's law of logarithmic returns, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;exponentially-increasing computational power is required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;provide linear increase in &quot;smartness&quot;, or some measure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;problems we can handle.  For instance, finding primes of 2N bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;takes much more than twice the computational power of finding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;primes of N bits.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I also expect that the computational complexity of cognition is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;an exponential function of the size of working memory, so that if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;we currently have a working memory that can store 5 chunks, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;amount of computation available in the universe limits us to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;double-digit number of chunks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As we all know, humans required thousands of much times as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain tissue as chimpanzees to produce only a small increment in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance; if you look around on the street, you can easily see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that each additional 10 IQ points requires a rough doubling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cranial volume.  If you still think the ascent of AIs will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rapid, a further caution is provided by the evolutionary history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the hominid family:  After requiring only 50,000 years to go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Australopithecus to late Homo erectus, it then required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another five million years to produce Homo sapiens.  Most of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we think of as impressive benefits and major impacts of &quot;human&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, such as guns and nuclear weapons, were invented by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monkeys twenty million years ago.  Our closest cousins, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chimpanzees, have most human abilities - including combinatorial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language, machines with moving parts, and crude scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; journals - which also suggests that it is unlikely for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular AI project to get many major abilities in advance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other AI projects.  The ongoing military and economic competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals has stalemated for millennia;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slight improvements in brainpower simply do not amount to all that

<p>Is.
<br>
<p>Beautiful.
<br>
<p>It needs to be put up on the web somwhere, so I can point people to

it.
<br>
<p>I've never edited the SL4 Wiki before, so I'm scared to put it there

(don't want to step on people's toes).
