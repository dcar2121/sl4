<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I enjoy very much seeing the different views brought to this
<br>
discussion and in reading these responses I would like to purpose a
<br>
small thought experiment to better illustrate the issue I have in
<br>
mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that a perfect one-to-one copy of your central nervous
<br>
system is made and either uploaded into a simulation (or some other
<br>
form of virtual presence) or put into a perfect reconstruction of your
<br>
body. Also imagine that during this process you, the original source
<br>
for this copy, is not destroyed. Next, allow that after the activation
<br>
of this copy you are able to communicate with him/her/it (whatever
<br>
your preference). Clearly two seperate egos are making contact and
<br>
sharing ideas. Imagine you now shut off or otherwise destroy this
<br>
copy, disregarding the ethical questions this action poses. This
<br>
action of course would leave you standing, breathing and able to live
<br>
on with your life. From your perspective you are alive and are able to
<br>
voice this fact, you exist in the world in some shape or form. Now
<br>
reverse this process of destruction, from your perspective you are no
<br>
longer able to voice your existence. You, speaking in terms of ego,
<br>
are no longer living.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now would be a good time to highlight the fact that while I can
<br>
take some sort of contentedness in knowing a copy of me lives on, is
<br>
still effecting the world in a way which I would have had I continued
<br>
to live, from my ego's point of view I have done the very rough
<br>
equivalent of having a child, of leaving a progeny of some sort
<br>
behind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, to take this thought experiment a bit further, imagine
<br>
that you allow both the original and the copy to exist simultaneously.
<br>
Due to different experiences they will slowly diverge from a single
<br>
persona into two distinct personas (the nature vs. nurture discussions
<br>
I'm sure would verify this to satisfaction for most). Instead of
<br>
carrying this already lengthy experiment on I ask that you consider
<br>
the ramifications of this on the current discussion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the question of the soul, I am in no way trying to allude to
<br>
this existence of such a thing. The discussion of such a topic in my
<br>
mind is very different than the nature of the current topic I am
<br>
attempting to highlight.
