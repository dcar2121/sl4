<p>Yes.

<p>&quot;Scale unfortunately&quot; != exponential, which was his claim.  If it
<br>
was exponential, brain size would be an exponential WRT
<br>
intelligence, since clearly working memory *is* a key intelligence
<br>
component.  The size of my brain vs. a chimps disproves that
<br>
assertion.  QED.

coat-tails here)
