This is an important thread.
<br>
<p>I think that Kurzweil's tendency to emphasize exponential curves of 
<br>
general technology is really a nuisance.  I don't care how many curves 
<br>
he finds, I think that without AGI we simply cannot get more than a 
<br>
certain rate of new technological development.  Frankly, I think it will 
<br>
hit a plateau.  (I even have my suspicions that we already did hit the 
<br>
plateau).
<br>
<p>And as for AGI, this for me is *the* definition of the Singularity. 
<br>
None of the rest is very important.  Without it, I see so many 
<br>
limitations on the ability of human engineers to handle the complexity 
<br>
of ordinary technology that I do not believe there will be any dramatic 
<br>
advances in the near future.  I think spacecraft will continue to blow 
<br>
up because of single-line errors in their code, and the IRS will fail 
<br>
again and again to upgrade their computer software.
<br>
<p>And there seems to be some confusion about the timeline.  When the first 
<br>
AGI reaches near or at human level intelligence, it will still take a 
<br>
while before the takeoff.  After thinking through all the factors 
<br>
involved, my guess would be a year or two.  I get the impression some 
<br>
people think it will be human level AGI one day, and then up as far as 
<br>
superintelligence later on the same day.
<br>
<p>So Kurzweil has done a disservice to the idea by emphasizing those 
<br>
curves.  It just does not make sense to look at a curve and suppose that 
<br>
no new factors will kick in as it heads off to infinity.  It was the 
<br>
same sort of silly reasoning that made people predict, a hundred years 
<br>
ago, that horse dung would soon be filling city streets to a depth of 10 
<br>
feet, because of the rate at which horse drawn traffic was increasing.
