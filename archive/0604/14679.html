<p>
&quot;Brain limited&quot;?  I'm guessing all the measurements done by respectable
<br>
research have been on untweaked brains.  Suppose we do manage to grow a
<br>
synthetic equivalent of human brain in a lab.  Before 'it' claims
<br>
inalienable rights for itself, we (ignorantly?) will likely be performing
<br>
the kinds of experiments that are immoral to do to real people (or monkeys,
<br>
or rats, or what-have-you)
<br>
<p>How much overclocking is the human wetware capable of supporting?  Assuming
<br>
we have a guaranteed replacement warranty, how far can human neural hardware
<br>
be pushed before meltdown?  ex:  I've noticed that ginkgo does affect my
<br>
concentration.  If the reason for this is nothing more than a slight
<br>
increase in oxygenated blood flow to the brain, then what other nutrition
<br>
deficits could easily be corrected to optimize brain performance?
<br>
(rhetorical question, obviously I could google an answer by researching for
<br>
a few hours)  My point is that many people neglect their own physiological
<br>
requirements for optimal performance.
<br>
<p>Back to the home-grown brain.  Assume we have an interface that we can
<br>
interact with and somehow take metrics.  Can we get significant increases in
<br>
performance from a meat-based CPU by radically altering the chemicals
<br>
available?  Is there an exploitable side effect of inducing synesthesia for
<br>
multiplexing information?  Sure, the stresses would probably make a human
<br>
test subject &quot;opt-out&quot; long before the usage was perfected or controlled,
<br>
but if we're talking about lab-grown brain blocks who would complain?  Are
<br>
the common themes of hallucinogenics like DMT, LSD, etc 'merely' a product
<br>
of conditioning, or do those themes arise from a function of a particular
<br>
compound's effect on the observer's information processing resources.  I am
<br>
not advocating controlled substance abuse, though this example is probably
<br>
more compelling than caffeine or increased blood sugar.  I am also not
<br>
advocating any actual experiments along this line of thinking.  This might
<br>
be more appropriate in the list of unwelcome paths to an unmitigated goal of
<br>
UFAI that is probing the same question I just asked.
<br>
<p>Still, I am curious what the opinions are of much more informed thinkers
<br>
than myself.  Clearly the speed of meat-based thinking is far slower than
<br>
silicon (or computronium, etc)  Will there be any redeeming use for
<br>
biological/chemical architecture once we have not as much bootstrapped, but
<br>
shoehorned ourselves into new hardware?  I assume by the time we have
<br>
destructive scanning uploads that a method of growing artificial neurons
<br>
would be equally doable so the uploaded could also be downloaded if there
<br>
was any desire to do so.  (like an upload to preserve Self, wait around
<br>
either in subjective real-time or zero-time for a new body to be
<br>
grown/harvested/produced, download into the new and improved computing
<br>
substrate.  How weird to think about a completely new body being 'easier'
<br>
for medical science than to fix an existing body with cancer...  OK, maybe
<br>
the technology to cure disease will be available - what makes one body more
<br>
special than any other?
<br>
<p>I apologize if you think this was simply too transhumanist.  I started from
<br>
the &quot;human-brain-limited point&quot; and ended in new territory.  I don't know
<br>
where to draw the line between thinking of a brain, my brain, general human
<br>
brains, our global collective processing power as a brain...  My guess is
<br>
that Singularity will redefine that line anyway.
<br>
<p>PS:  I don't think it would require much for GMail to have run a search on
<br>
the word &quot;computronium&quot; before suggesting that it was spelled wrong -
<br>
especially since the first Google hit is a wikipedia link.  This should be a
<br>
'no brainer' (pun intended) for an improvement to the tools the smart
<br>
monkeys use in their endeavors to make smarter tools.
