I read the pdfs on that link, and found some parts quite funny:
<br>
<p>&quot;Live in the woods for a week and see if it's your laptop you miss most.&quot;
<br>
<p>Basically this quote means &quot;a laptop is not necessary to survive&quot;,
<br>
which says nothing about its usefulness for humans, which commonly
<br>
have higher objectives than surviving.
<br>
<p>&quot;The Internet is the plastic of the twenty-first century. Its
<br>
important applications aren't new and the new ones aren't important.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, sending large content quickly and easily around the world isn't
<br>
new and important?
<br>
<p>&quot;Technology change is disrupting, but it has been for centuries. Change is
<br>
unchanging. Relax–the carousel isn't spinning faster.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yeah right, as if people couldn't feel the increasingly faster changes
<br>
that technology imposes nowadays compared to a few centuries ago.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sure, today's technology is a big deal. But so was yesterday's. We
<br>
stand on the shoulders of giants.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thank you, Captain Obvious! Do most people really need to hear this? I
<br>
don't think people are so stupid as to believe that technologies are
<br>
made in a vacuum, disregarding the past...
<br>
<p>&quot;The Internet hasn't revolutionized a thing—it just lets you do what
<br>
you already could do, but with a little more speed or convenience.&quot;
<br>
<p>My opinion is that, even if the second part of this sentence is true
<br>
(disregarding the &quot;a little more speed&quot; part, which is obviously
<br>
false), the first one isn't - human nature dictates that speed and
<br>
convenience are capable of affecting qualitative aspects, not only
<br>
quantitative ones. People do things they didn't do in the past because
<br>
they have access to information and the capability of doing
<br>
smaller/prerequisite things faster.
<br>
<p>He also makes a lot of true points, but those are mostly in the &quot;don't
<br>
waste so much money on upgrades and new stuff if you don't really need
<br>
to change&quot;, not in the technology trend areas.
