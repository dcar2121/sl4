<p>Yes and No.  The hype resulted in a massive build out of connectivity  
<br>
that is enabling hundreds of millions of people to connect up at  
<br>
broadband speed.  Vastly more was built out than we use even today.    
<br>
The &quot;internet&quot; is not just the actual connectivity stuff but  
<br>
everything that has been and can be built on top of it.  I would say  
<br>
that the beginning of the ubiquitous always on connectivity between  
<br>
all intelligences and computation on earth is a REALLY BIG DEAL.   In  
<br>
my view some major investments were and still are required to make  
<br>
the benefits ubiquitous and to enable maximal usefulness and SL  
<br>
levels.   The hype was extremely useful in this way.  I am only sorry  
<br>
that it flamed out so abruptly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And now, today, we are in Nanohype Land, of course:  there used to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a valid and visionary thing called nanotechnology, but now we  
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Not entirely.  Yes true MNT is undervalued and even denied public  
<br>
funding.  But the interest in all things at the nano level will not  
<br>
be without benefit.   Tools that are useful for more interesting  
<br>
nanotech will be developed and funds will be diverted.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; What I find interesting to contemplate is how the Singularity Hype  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will develop in the near future.  How long before someone finds a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to cash in on the Singularity concept and milk the cash cows in  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to do nothing whatsoever of any relevance to the real  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity?  What form will the hype take?
</em><br>
<p>I would rather ask how the influx of cash and interest can be used to  
<br>
achieve true Singularity.  We are somewhat evolved chimps on this  
<br>
rock.  The majority are not going to &quot;get it&quot; and we can't be such  
<br>
purist that we require them to before we move forward.  The best we  
<br>
can do is to ride the waves of actual resources skillfully regardless  
<br>
of how much bogosity, cynicism, greed and whatever may be giving them  
<br>
their power.
