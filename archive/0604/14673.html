<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now *that* is not business as usual.  For the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, the technology 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes the generator of new technology.  Never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened before.  Not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just more of the same, but a whole new ball game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is what the Singularity is all about, and why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it makes no sense to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that new technology is not such a big deal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>In their aggregate impact, the invention of
<br>
one-to-many
<br>
teaching and one-to-many copying have been very 
<br>
large.
<br>
<p>By the former, I mean teaching in schools like Plato's
<br>
Academy, then re-developed in cathedral schools and
<br>
universities in the Middle Ages.  This is in contrast
<br>
to the apprenticeship system where knowledge was
<br>
distributed linearly.
<br>
<p>By the latter, I mean first block printing, then 
<br>
movable type printing, versus manuscript copying.
<br>
Both developments made the transfer of knowledge
<br>
exponentially faster.  Since they started from a
<br>
very small base, it has taken centuries to build
<br>
up literacy and large libraries.
<br>
<p>The internet/web/google/word processing, etc. type
<br>
tools I estimate has made me twice as productive
<br>
in the kind of knowledge work I do, relative to
<br>
before the advent of desktop PCs, but that improvement
<br>
has come in a couple of decades.
<br>
<p>Given the spread of literacy and university-level
<br>
education to more countries in the past 20 years,
<br>
it's arguable whether the PC-based improvements are
<br>
the dominant effect yet, but at some point it
<br>
will be.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, in the physical realm, manufacturing
<br>
productivity has doubled in 13 years in the US:
<br>

<br>
<p>I think we're well on our way to a fully-automated
<br>
production environment, shortly to be followed by
<br>
automated transportation and retail delivery
<br>
(think shelf-stocking robots and automated french
<br>
fry and hamburger machines).  
<br>
<p>What are all those low-skilled people going to be
<br>
doing in that environment?
