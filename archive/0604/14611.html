</em><br>
<p>Ricardo is spot on.  There has been extensive work done analyzing what
<br>
a goal is, what types of goals humans and nonhumans and
<br>
systems-in-general have or might have or should have, intentionality,
<br>
motivation, and self-deception about goals.  The usual suspects --
<br>
psychology, computer science, economics, et al. -- are all involved.
<br>
<p>For one to attempt to discuss goals seriously without having read up
<br>
on this background material is an instance of a general sort of error
<br>
most commonly made by those who have never studied any particular
<br>
field in depth, and hence don't grok that for almost every interesting
<br>
topic, and actually many uninteresting topics, much has already been
<br>
written that they *must* become familiar with before anyone who *is*
<br>
knowledgable in the area will listen to anything they have to say
<br>
(and, perhaps more importantly, they must become familiar with it to
<br>
avoid reinventing wheels, re-committing known mistakes, and otherwise
<br>
churning away without contributing to any real progress in the field).
<br>
<p>It's good that some people are recognizing that people have a tendency
<br>
toward armchair theorizing without getting specific, technical, or
<br>
otherwise utile via a more formal, precise approach.  But to suggest
<br>
the way out of this is to reinvent definitions and ontologies related
<br>
to 'goals', void of prior work, is ... no better? ... no, it's better,
<br>
it's progress... but it's not better enough to have shrugged off the
<br>
&quot;complete waste of time&quot; crown.
<br>
<p>If methodologies, in addition to subject matter, were to have 'shock
<br>
levels', this one would be decidedly 0.
<br>
<p>That said, let me reiterate that I am entirely supportive of your
<br>
intention (&quot;1&quot; in your list); it's the &quot;2&quot; in play that needs an
<br>
upgrade.
