<p>
Sorry for coming into this discussion late in the game.  I'm the author of
<br>
the book Future Hype that got this started.  I've read your posts with
<br>
interest.  I'd like to add a few comments.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
First, one small issue.  While I appreciate Robin's forwarding my original
<br>
email, of course, I don't think it was actually spam.  Robin, you and I
<br>
exchanged emails about five years ago on a Lojban vocabulary training
<br>
program that I'd written.  Still, it's understandable that you've forgotten.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As for the comments that have gone back and forth, I have gotten a bit of
<br>
this in other circles.  That is, some people say, &quot;This is *completely* off
<br>
base!&quot; while others say &quot;But it does present some valid concerns.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A couple of postings suggest that my comments (sound bites?) are too
<br>
extreme.  Touche!  There are some places (more on the web site than in the
<br>
book) where I succumb to marketing needs/desires and use too much marketing
<br>
hyperbole.  That's a bit embarassing in front of, not a consumer audience,
<br>
but a technically-aware one.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm clearly going to be at odds with anyone who takes an extreme
<br>
the-Singularity-is-near position.  Given that inherent challenge, let me
<br>
elaborate on where I'm coming from.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
On the topic of &quot;the Internet and PC are not that big a deal.&quot;  Sure, the
<br>
Internet and PC unprecedented -- but that's true for every other major
<br>
technology that's come before.  We've never had the kind of communications
<br>
ability that the Internet gives us.  But we never before had the kind of
<br>
transportation ability that the jet airplane gave us (1950s), or, before
<br>
that, the railroad (1850s).  The skyscraper and other big civil engineering
<br>
projects had their heyday in the early 1900s.  The transition from
<br>
information as cargo to information as data came with the telegraph --
<br>
*that* was a big deal.  And keep in mind that it wasn't the Internet that
<br>
brought information to the masses, it was the fast steam printing presses of
<br>
the early 1800s.  (Micah Glasser's 4/13 post had an excellent list of prior
<br>
art that puts the Internet and PC in perspective.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Exponential curves were mentioned.  On this topic, let's talk about Moore's
<br>
Law.  Truly amazing.  And yet, the increases at the low level have a hard
<br>
time percolating up to the user level.  A PC that's twice as fast as the one
<br>
you have now won't make you twice as productive (unless you have an unusual
<br>
application that's compute-bound).  A PC that's a *hundred* times faster
<br>
won't even make you twice as productive.  And yet look at something as
<br>
mundane as a dump truck.  You double the primary specification, its
<br>
capacity, and you double the productivity of the operator.  Construction
<br>
equipment, farming equipment, factory machines -- they all work this way.
<br>
If only the PC did the same ...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
One other pitfall we need to avoid is when we compare today's technology
<br>
marvels vs. those of some previous period.  With all the hype we see in the
<br>
press and from tech companies, it's easy to put into the &quot;Today's
<br>
Technology&quot; bin not only things like PCs and the Internet, which are indeed
<br>
causing much change today, but also all the stuff on the cover of Popular
<br>
Science -- that is, things that are still in the lab.  These would be
<br>
technologies like nanotech, biotech, electronic paper, the hydrogen economy,
<br>
and so on.  It's not a fair comparison if we pad today's technology with
<br>
stuff that *might* make it.  (I don't need to tell you of the long list of
<br>
promised technology that didn't materialize as promised -- videophone,
<br>
fusion power, moon bases, AI, home robots, personal flying vehicles, and so
<br>
on.  Sorry to have to break it to you, but all those cool technologies in
<br>
the lab are *not* inevitable.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I don't think this is going to have you and me holding hands and singing
<br>
Kumbaya, but hopefully you have a bit more information of what I'm saying.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Bob
