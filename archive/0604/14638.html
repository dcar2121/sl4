<p>I invite you to hypothesize any algorithm for processing n items in
<br>
memory, where any of the n items can be combined with any of the other
<br>
n-1 items, that takes computional resources linear in n.  THAT is the
<br>
foolish notion.
<br>
<p>I don't think comparing monkeys to humans is as good as considering
<br>
what we know about algorithms, because it is hard to make objective
<br>
measurements about the outcomes, and because there are so many
<br>
complicating factors.  Nevertheless, a human brain has a volume of
<br>
about 1600 cubic centimeters, and a neocortical surface area of about
<br>
1570 square centimeters.  A rhesus monkey has a brain volume of 70-90
<br>
cubic centimeters, and a macaque monkey has a neocortical surface area
<br>
of about 72 square centimeters.
<br>
<p>If you find yourself wondering why SL4 has so little worthwhile
<br>
scientific discourse, I would suggest that venues that observe the
<br>
niceties of scientific discourse attract more an better scientists
<br>
than venues that do not.  There is a difference between dispensing
<br>
with politness for the sake of efficiency, and using sarcasm rather
<br>
than reason to attack a position (and a person).  It's Eliezer's list,
<br>
so if he'd rather indulge in personal invectives than have scientific
<br>
discourse here, it's up to him.
