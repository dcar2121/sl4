<p>I'm sure you're right for an initial estimate.  After things get working and 
<br>
start being understood, however, expect to be able to pare at least an order 
<br>
of magnitude off the estimate for the initial requirement.
<br>
<p>How much computing power you need is partially determined by how efficient 
<br>
your models are.  If, e.g., you use a neural model of a clock, you will end 
<br>
up with both a clock that's rather inefficient, and an excessive number of 
<br>
neural connections.  When it comes to other features, however, e.g., possibly 
<br>
pattern matching, our current estimates may be either right on the money, or 
<br>
even a bit low.  Still, some neural connections are pretty clearly time delay 
<br>
loops, and those can be done much more efficiently that by neural simulation.  
<br>
This implies that there exist other features that once we understand, we will 
<br>
be able to simulate without replicating all the circuitry.
