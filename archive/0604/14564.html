<p>
I think the problem with Seidensticker's Future Hype book is that it is 
<br>
both ridiculous and, unfortunately, partly truthful.
<br>
<p>For him to dismiss the PC as just another invention (as in &quot;the Internet 
<br>
and the PC are not that big a deal&quot;) is surely a mistake:  there are now 
<br>
hundreds of millions of people who, because they have a PC, have a tool 
<br>
with which they could learn to program, then learn about AI, then figure 
<br>
out how to build an intelligence and then perhaps go on to trigger the 
<br>
Singularity.  If those same hundreds of millions possessed any of the 
<br>
other inventions below they would not be in that position.
<br>
<p>But on the other hand, if Seidensticker wants to point to stupidly 
<br>
overhyped technology, he is speaking words of wisdom.  The imaginary 
<br>
version of the internet that drove the investors into a feeding frenzy 
<br>
in the late 1990's was a complete fiction.  By itself, the internet was 
<br>
good, but it was not *that* good.  There are a lot of details that we 
<br>
could argue about here, but my basic point is that the internet by 
<br>
itself (not the other things that might one day be facilitated by it, 
<br>
but the direct thing in itself) was not something to get that worked up 
<br>
about.  It was convenient for the Market, because the Market has a 
<br>
voracious need for (controlled) volatility, fresh blood and emotional 
<br>
enthusiasm in order for the skillful players to make their killings, but 
<br>
for the world in general it would have been better if the internet had 
<br>
simply developed at a regular pace and nobody threw a hundred billion 
<br>
dollars down the toilet trying to get rich on it.
<br>
<p>And now, today, we are in Nanohype Land, of course:  there used to be a 
<br>
valid and visionary thing called nanotechnology, but now we have a 
<br>
completely redefined new thing that uses the same name but is 
<br>
essentially just a convenient hook on which companies can hang some old 
<br>
clothes and snag some extra funding.  Plus ca change....
<br>
<p>What I find interesting to contemplate is how the Singularity Hype will 
<br>
develop in the near future.  How long before someone finds a way to cash 
<br>
in on the Singularity concept and milk the cash cows in order to do 
<br>
nothing whatsoever of any relevance to the real Singularity?  What form 
<br>
will the hype take?
<br>
<p>Obvious and simple answer:  they will start announcing that they have 
<br>
built the world's first true AGI, or that they can do it with a million 
<br>
dollar grant, a year and a couple of research assistants.
<br>
<p>We have already seen examples of this kind of announcement, and my best 
<br>
guess about all of them, so far, is that they are pure hype, cynically 
<br>
designed to get investment and/or grants.
<br>
<p>I only wish that someone like Seidensticker could write a book debunking 
<br>
the charlatans and hype mongers, whilst at the same time making a strong 
<br>
case for the potential of real technological breakthroughs.  Sigh!  Too 
<br>
much to expect, I think.
