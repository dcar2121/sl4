<p>I was not only talking about people flocking and using and enjoying stuff 
<br>
in the Internet. I was also talking about people being paid to learn 
<br>
things like Java to do software engineering. In Finland at the bubble 
<br>
time, people from all educations with practically no experience in 
<br>
software engineering were pulled into companies to write code; to do other 
<br>
stuff necessary for software engineering. People who in another kind of 
<br>
world would never have learned to code one single line did because of the 
<br>
bubble. 
<br>
<p>The result is that there's a lot more people with some skills making code 
<br>
and most of those people are not experts and even particularly good. But 
<br>
they have broken the barrier of transforming themselves into an 
<br>
algorithmic world (say SL0.5). Because of this, we have an entire extra 
<br>
generation of people who got to the paradigm when they were young. 
<br>
Otherwise, it would have taken another 5-15 years and my generation would 
<br>
have been mostly lost to the SL0. 
<br>
<p>The market did something that the public education systems could not 
<br>
adequately do. It trained people to the new industry. That is an asset 
<br>
that the investors have no way of getting return on, it's the people who 
<br>
worked in the industries who got all that benefit. The financial markets 
<br>
did probably the biggest education campaign out of their pockets that has 
<br>
ever happened in the history of human civilization.
<br>
<p>A good example of the same kind is from history of railroads. Britain was 
<br>
practically the only country in the world that let people just build 
<br>
railroads without government interference. They experienced great booms 
<br>
and great busts. Still they created much denser railroad network in a lot 
<br>
faster time than any other country in the world. Lots of over investment? 
<br>
Yes. But market based overinvestment has the nice quality that it tends to 
<br>
look under every rock for profit. And thus also lots of good things get 
<br>
invested in - things that people would definitely have overlooked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; diversity of stuff funded by it for both fun and profit generated a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of rapid evolution.  Sure, the Internet would have happened anyway, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would have happened a hell of a lot slower.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.
