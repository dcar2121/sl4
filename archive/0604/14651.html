<p>Uh?   My point was that, yes, it does make a convenient magic number, 
<br>
but for a different argument:  what is probably happening in STM is that 
<br>
there are several thousand things in &quot;short term memory&quot; at any given 
<br>
moment, but if the system tries to keep several unconnected groups of 
<br>
things in there, it can only reliably keep seven sets of them before one 
<br>
of those groups gets descheduled.
<br>
<p>In the context of *that* kind of perspective on STM, the recent 
<br>
discussion about seven items, and about making comparisons between them 
<br>
(serially?  to what end?) would not make a great deal of sense.
