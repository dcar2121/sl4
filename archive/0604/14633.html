<p>Thanks!  I hadn't seen this before.  Appears very relevant.
<br>
<p>My introduction to game theory was about 1983 with an article in
<br>
Scientific American on the Prisoners' Dilemma.  I don't remember
<br>
whether that was the article written by Douglas Hofstader, [Google
<br>
confirms it is.] but I was already a huge fan of his upon reading
<br>
Godel Escher Bach in 1979.  Since then I've read extensively work by
<br>
Axelrod, some work by Von Neuman and some commentary by Bertrand
<br>
Russel, and various updates on PD competitions with strategies that
<br>
surpass the original tit for tat by enlarging the scope.
<br>
<p>The 1983 Sci Am article really set me to thinking about how apparently
<br>
rational strategies can easily be seen to be irrational in a larger
<br>
context, and it was about then that I came to the realization that all
<br>
paradox is a matter of insufficient context, given my belief (and
<br>
observation) that in the bigger picture all the pieces must fit.
<br>
<p>I highly value Hofstadter's concept of &quot;superrationality&quot; but have
<br>
found little resonance with others on this point.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Some other things that might be of interest include Karl Popper and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; David Deutsch. If you haven't read the latter's Fabric of Reality, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might find it interesting. It probably doesn't contain a lot of new stuff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for you, but it does put things together in a fresh and interesting way.
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm quite familiar with Popper's work, but only went as far with
<br>
Deutch as to read others' comments and discussions of his book _Fabric
<br>
of Reality_.  I'll reconsider taking a deeper look at it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I've been working through a lot of game theory and morality stuff in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past and have found that an approach that is very good for understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you might know, there are people who believe that moral systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be distinguished, because value propositions are claimed to be such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no natural thing that happens can justify, or refute them. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually does not hold, if we require a moral system to describe both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values (goals) and the means to get there.
</em><br>
<p><p>Or, if we consider how we got here with the morals that we have.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One of the simple rules that David once suggested for determining goodness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of such a moral system is to determine whether it succeeds by its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lights, i.e. do the means accomplish the ends that the moral system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocates. Note that this is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good moral system. We should be able to develop other good ways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critisizing moral systems and thus evolve our knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that it works is necessary, but not sufficient.
<br>
<p>Thanks Mikko for your pointers on this.
<br>
