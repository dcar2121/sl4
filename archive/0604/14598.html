<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My intuition, based on experience with how much computational power it

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logarithmic returns, is that exponentially-increasing computational

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power is required to provide linear increase in &quot;smartness&quot;, or some

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measure of the problems we can handle.  For instance, finding primes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finding primes of N bits.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also expect that the computational complexity of cognition is an
