</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Actually, it is not clear that the investment was a bad thing from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society's perspective. It was from the investor's perspective. The reason 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This in turn hastened the evolution and revolution caused by Internet. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm.... I doubt very much that the stock market frenzy did anything 
<br>
very significant in that regard.  If the bubble had not happened, people 
<br>
would still have flocked to use and enjoy the stuff that the internet 
<br>
made available, would they not?
<br>
<p>The damage done by the bubble, on the other hand, was enormous.
<br>
<p>I can give a little personal example to illustrate.  During the boom 
<br>
time when everyone believed that this was a brave new era of fabulous 
<br>
technology and that the stock market rise was the beginning of something 
<br>
new, big and permanent, the people who managed a little Montessori 
<br>
school near here found that their enrollment was growing so rapidly that 
<br>
they could not cope with the demand.
<br>
<p>They really hated the pain of turning away kids for lack of space, so 
<br>
they decided to take out a loan to expand the school and hire more 
<br>
teachers.  Not being experienced managers (the school is run as a co-op) 
<br>
they took the advice of a local bank and a nefarious local contractor 
<br>
...... and then found themselves sitting on an overpriced expansion, a 
<br>
viciously structured loan and (when the bubble burst and nobody could 
<br>
afford to send their children to private school anymore) a massive drop 
<br>
in enrollment.  The school was brought to the edge of bankruptcy, and to 
<br>
this day it limps along with enormously high fees that mostly go to pay 
<br>
the mortgage and other debts.
<br>
<p>These people were not scheming investors, they were only trying to do 
<br>
their best to cope with the changes forced on them by the boom.
<br>
<p>This story was doubtless repeated in various ways all over the place, 
<br>
and of course this is a pretty mild example, as heartbreaks go.
