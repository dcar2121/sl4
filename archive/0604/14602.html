<p>&nbsp;From a first-person perspective, here on pre-Singularity Earth, the end 
<br>
effect of this variant hypothesis is the same: you still get I. J. 
<br>
Good's intelligence explosion, but it runs even faster because there was 
<br>
so much room to run in.  There are a variety of things that could 
<br>
finally upper-bound an intelligence explosion - physical resource 
<br>
limits, predicted by current models, being more plausible in my eyes 
<br>
than elaborate hypotheses of computer science with no supporting 
<br>
evidence.  But so long as the top is much, much higher than where we 
<br>
are, and the trajectory there is subjectively fast from the perspective 
<br>
of a modern-day human, it seems a distinction without a distance.  From 
<br>
our perspective, it just adds up to:  AI go ker-FOOM.
<br>
<p>I admit that my perspective here is a bit narrow - but then, existential 
<br>
risks and existential benefits tend to dominate the information value of 
<br>
questions.
