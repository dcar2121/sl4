<p>Okay:  I can find a mapping between this and my architecture, although 
<br>
with (what sound like) subtle variations in many places.
<br>
<p>The one big distinction that I enforce, but which you might not do, is 
<br>
between what is in the background (not being thought about or perceived 
<br>
or deployed in any way) and what is in the foreground .... the latter is 
<br>
the sum total of what the system is thinking about (contents of 
<br>
consciousness).  Why the distinction?  Because I believe in putting the 
<br>
latter in a place where there is very rapid and extensive connectivity, 
<br>
so these things can link together and interact.  What is backgrounded 
<br>
right now must not be allowed to interfere with the stuff in the 
<br>
foreground, because the latter is busy interrelating and engaging in 
<br>
various relaxation processes, so the less clutter, the better.
<br>
<p>However, having said that there should not be too much clutter, the 
<br>
foreground does still contain many elements (concepts) that are 
<br>
transiently activated because there is a chance they might be needed ... 
<br>
so there is actually a lot of extraneous stuff hanging around.  So when 
<br>
people do priming experiments and look for effects on (say) word/nonword 
<br>
discriminations due to associate distractors, this is what they are 
<br>
picking up.
<br>
<p>Now, when I talked about STM having perhaps thousands of things in it, I 
<br>
was referring to the thing I have called the &quot;foreground&quot; here. 
<br>
(obviously in a short sketch like this I cannot bring in all the 
<br>
background justifications, but I hope I can conevey the general idea).
<br>
<p>The foreground is not necessarily an undifferentiated module:  it is 
<br>
likely to have several semi-specialized subcompartments (various aspects 
<br>
of language processing, for example), so this sounds a bit like what you 
<br>
call &quot;units of the memory corresponding to particular 'interaction 
<br>
channels'&quot;.
<br>
<p>As to the chunking issue (the magic number seven), here is what I see 
<br>
happening:  the foreground is allowed a ration, when it comes to 
<br>
configurations of items that are not strongly grounded by their 
<br>
connections to immediate sensory input or motor output, but which are 
<br>
instead floating free and independent of one another.  Why is it 
<br>
rationed?  There may be several explanations, but here is one possibility.
<br>
<p>The foreground is always creating new elements (element = unit that 
<br>
capture one concept) to cope with the situations that it encounters.  A 
<br>
lot of these new elements are purely episodic and low level (they will 
<br>
end up sitting in memory as traces memories of the situation you 
<br>
experienced or thought about at that time, in that situation), but some 
<br>
will be genuine new &quot;concepts&quot; that the system is supposed to remember 
<br>
because they might be the beginning of new ideas.  So if you see a 
<br>
conjunction of two things and those two things have not been seen 
<br>
together before, make an element to capture their conjunction.
<br>
<p>But there are limits on the number of different things that it is 
<br>
sensible to combine together to make a new concept:  the system knows 
<br>
that the best way to deal with the world is to build new concepts that 
<br>
consist of small numbers of components in the regularity .... just a 
<br>
practical matter of experience here, because maybe evolution told it 
<br>
that if you go around sticking groups of 27 new things together, you get 
<br>
bogus concepts (like the concept of watching all the movies of Tuesday 
<br>
Weld in one week after eating a hamburger that tasted more like a hot 
<br>
dog, just after your brother fell over and hurt his knee, on the same 
<br>
day that Lancashire beat Derbyshire at Lords) that will never amount to 
<br>
anything ever again.
<br>
<p>However, the process of making new concepts can be forced if the 
<br>
attention system puts some effort into it, knowing (for some high level 
<br>
reason) that it would be good to cram a lot of things into an episode. 
<br>
So if you push it, you can remember about seven unrelated things.
<br>
<p>Now, if someone asked me what is the size of STM, I would have to ask 
<br>
what they meant by STM, and in particular I would get frustrated if they 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(not you, Ben, but old time cognitive psychology people) insisted that 
<br>
all those &quot;partially activated&quot; concepts are not really part of STM, 
<br>
because they would be defining the different cognitive modules purely in 
<br>
terms of the effects that can be observed in different kinds of 
<br>
experiments, and that seems a dumb way of doing it if you are actually 
<br>
interested in working mechanisms, as I am.  To me, STM is the 
<br>
foreground, and there are probably thousands of things in it.
<br>
<p>In Eliezer's comment I saw shades of the approach I mentioned just now, 
<br>
which begs questions about why the seven things were just sitting in a 
<br>
box having comparisons made between them:  the main begged questions 
<br>
being things like &quot;What cognitive architecture is this part of?&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;Why would it help anything to do the comparisons?&quot;.
