<em>&gt; There is another way. Build a super-intelligent non-biological intelligence
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; would maintain the mega systems of earth such as electric grids, nuclear

<em>&gt; advance all sciences, such as medical science, the space exploration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sciences, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thus, the net effect of this SE SM is literally a technological systems

<em>&gt; paradise. The key to building such a friendly, safe-built, SE SM is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build it solely and exclusively as a science and engineering super-expert.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such a SE Singularity Machine will &quot;know&quot; its expertise to be exclusively
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; exclusively shine in science and engineering. As such, a SE Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Machine will ALWAYS defer ALL politcal and religious issues to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate experts, and get back to science and engineering, which is its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exclusive Expertise and sole Prime Purpose.

</em><br>
<p>Effectively promoting shared human values into the future requires
<br>
effectiveness in two complementary areas:
<br>
<p>(1) Subjective (increasingly intersubjective) understanding of our shared values
<br>
Humans display a wide array of complex values, but have much in common
<br>
due to our common evolutionary history.  We have values encoded at the
<br>
genetic/developmental level expressed as inate feelings of affection,
<br>
joy, disgust, etc., we have values encoded in our culture and
<br>
expressed as religious laws, community codes of ethics, and also other
<br>
less explicit forms, and we have values encoded in modes of reason and
<br>
rationality and supported by ideals such as &quot;truth&quot;, consistency,
<br>
coherence, and now emerging appreciation of growth and its
<br>
constituents diversity, cooperation and competition. Our shared values
<br>
are far from arbitrary, having been refined over a long process of
<br>
evolution.
<br>
<p>(2) Objective (increasingly objective) understanding of what works
<br>
Increasingly objective (scientific, instrumental) knowledge of what
<br>
works.  As with (1), an evolutionary process of increasingly effective
<br>
(and we assume, increasingly accurate) models of our universe tends to
<br>
increase our success.
<br>
<p>We are now approaching the point in human development when we have the
<br>
tools available and can take the next step up, above instinctual
<br>
morality and above culturally enforced ethics, to an intentional,
<br>
rational system of cooperative social decision-making.   A
<br>
network-based framework that can amplify our awareness of (1) our
<br>
shared subjective values and (2) our increasingly objective knowledge
<br>
of what works.
<br>
<p>Increasing awareness of what works, applied to increasing awareness of
<br>
our shared human values, leads to increasingly effective
<br>
decision-making that will be seen as increasingly good.
<br>
<p>This broad-based framework based on human values, amplified by
<br>
technology (including AI) will effectively promote our values into the
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>Unless we destroy ourselves first.
