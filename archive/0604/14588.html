<em>&gt;&gt; So Kurzweil has done a disservice to the idea by emphasizing those

<em>&gt;&gt; no new factors will kick in as it heads off to infinity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In TSIN, Kurzweil specifically acknowledges and discusses how,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historically, any particular factor/technology has always hit a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plateau, and that we should (and he does) quite strongly expect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any exponential trends that continue will similarly depend on new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors as old &amp; current technologies hit their own plateaus.
</em><br>
<p>I guess it doesn't surprise me that he would address the point (too 
<br>
obvious for him not to), but what exactly is his claim?  That each 
<br>
individual technology has an upward curve followed by a plateau, but 
<br>
that the collection of separate curves has its own overall trend that is 
<br>
exponential?
<br>
<p>Assuming that were his argument, I would contest it on the same grounds: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't believe that unassisted human expertise (technology sans AGI) 
<br>
is going to be capable of creating dumb-but=fabulous technology without 
<br>
limit.  For example, without AGI I cannot see the MNT approach yielding 
<br>
a safe and viable form of geoengineering, or infinite life extension, 
<br>
because these things will turn out to involve so much complexity that 
<br>
our human engineers will not be able to get their heads around all the 
<br>
problems.  It is this that makes me look at the trend curves (either 
<br>
individually or en masse) and say that I am skeptical.
