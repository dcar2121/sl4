<p>
With regard to developing safe AI, I don't think there can be any
<br>
guarantee. The best we can do is to incorporate a model of human
<br>
values as broad-based as possible, and to promote the growth of our
<br>
evolving values based on principles rather than ends.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
- Jef
<br>
<p>There is another way. Build a super-intelligent non-biological intelligence
<br>
that is a science and engineering super-expert. This SE Singularity Machine
<br>
would maintain the mega systems of earth such as electric grids, nuclear
<br>
power plants, weather systems, transportation systems, etc., plus actively
<br>
advance all sciences, such as medical science, the space exploration
<br>
sciences, etc.
<br>
<p>Thus, the net effect of this SE SM is literally a technological systems
<br>
paradise. The key to building such a friendly, safe-built, SE SM is to
<br>
build it solely and exclusively as a science and engineering super-expert.
<br>
Such a SE Singularity Machine will &quot;know&quot; its expertise to be exclusively
<br>
science and engineering, and will &quot;feel&quot; its sole &quot;prime purpose&quot; to
<br>
exclusively shine in science and engineering. As such, a SE Singularity
<br>
Machine will ALWAYS defer ALL politcal and religious issues to the
<br>
appropriate experts, and get back to science and engineering, which is its
<br>
Exclusive Expertise and sole Prime Purpose. 
<br>
<p>This is the only kind of friendly AI that I could support at this time, all
<br>
else being too risky.
