<p>Fair comment, then, if a bit harshly phrased.  My response was in the 
<br>
parallel reply to Robin Lee Powell (which crossed with your reply): 
<br>
several factors may contribute to the level of intelligence in 
<br>
cross-species and intra-human comparisons, so that what is happening in 
<br>
the case of an intelligent human is that all those other factors are 
<br>
finally cleared out of the way and the brain hits the seven-chunk 
<br>
endstop that (hypothetically) could be determined by its volume.
<br>
<p>I took Phil's argument to be that from here on out the limiting factor 
<br>
might be the chunking limit, which could scale in a nasty way with 
<br>
volume, or be the result of a tradeoff that admits of no solutions 
<br>
whatsoever beyond a certain number of chunks.
<br>
<p>Personally, I am not as pessimistic as Phil, so I don't think this is 
<br>
going to be a problem, but I have only arguments like (a) chunking is 
<br>
probably not the main story when it comes to intelligence, and (b) the 
<br>
constraints on chunking anyway turn out to be polynomial and not 
<br>
exponential (wiring connectivity considerations by themselves shouldn't 
<br>
lead to exponentials).  But I think it is an open question.
