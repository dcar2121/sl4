Sorry about the post I didn't notice that the thread had been killed.

<em>&gt; I've often thought about this issue and have had serious questions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the possibility of 'uploading' because of it. This question, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, is nothing new. Philosophers have been discussing what constitutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity and the continuity of ego/consciousness since at least Descartes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Locke offers a particularly good discussion of it and, in more recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times, John Searle has discussed thought experiments in which he asks what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would happen if parts of the brain were slowly replaced with  artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware. Also Edmund Husserl spent his entire genius inspired life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grappling with questions of ego continuity and the nature of subjectivity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For my part I think I have come to a conclusion about what would happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the validity of certain presuppositions. If we presuppose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionalist theory of mind (which stipulates that the kind of hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that runs the algorithms of mind is irrelevant), and if we presuppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is such a thing as a conscious ego that experiences a continuity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity in time, then I think the following argument can be made:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If an exact replication of a humans nervous system was reproduced (either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically or virtually) including all memories and every last nuance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function then for a single moment there would be two identical individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But not really because the very moment there existed two identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals (which is, of course, a logical impossibility) there would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two individuals who shared a common past yet now had different memories (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequently different brain structures making them disernible) beginning at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point at which the two individuals diverged. So the conclusion to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drawn from this is that if an exact replication of a mind was fabricated or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precisely simulated then there would be two different individuals who share
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ego identity past yet were now two distinct beings. I don't think there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is any contradiction inherent in this. But if the original mind was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed at the moment of replication/divergence then the remaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual would still be a legitimate ego heir, so to speak, which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience a continuity of ego identity and could be said to be the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person that previously existed in another form.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course one may argue against my original premises and there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly room for debate there, but I would argue that given the validity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the premises the argument I present is logically valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I tend to think that the most questionable aspect of uploading is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption that consciousness (or qualia if you prefer) is something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily emerges from the patterns of certain physical substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes and cybernetics. I think it likely that consciousness does emerge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this manner but it is an assumption that could be wrong.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You are a different individual every moment, but your core brain

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; centers responsible for emerging consciousness are 99.9999% the same,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not 0% as you imply.  I suppose you can represent consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; digitally just like you can model weather or any *physical* system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If your representation is accurate (ignoring quantum and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; classical inaccuracy effects for the moment), you will get an accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; future prediction of the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How so?  To go from even a perfect model of your consciousness to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something useful for prediction would require first of all deciding what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; context or inputs you wanted a prediction for the behavior of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness in relation to and modeling those environmental inputs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with sufficient fidelity.  Next you would need to run the resulting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system at sufficient speed to get an answer in a time frame where it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; presumably useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But a future model of the system isn't the actual future system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; because those little binary ones and zeroes you are using for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; modelling, actually represent real *physical* properties.  Mass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; electromagnetic forces, gravity, quantum wavefront evolutions, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; That little sunshine button the cute weather girl points to when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to tomorrow's sunny forecast, isn't an actual star.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; physical properties our brains harness to give us awareness, are very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; different than are silicon logic gates being flip-flopped by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; electrons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am much more than a collection of data and algorithms.  What you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to is software.  My brain is hardware.  It runs off of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; multiverse *physics*, not Windows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; At bottom it may all be seen as just interacting patterns, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; information.   Don't worry.  No one here wants to simulate you on
