</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much computing power you need is partially determined by how efficient
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; neural connections.  When it comes to other features, however, e.g., possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern matching, our current estimates may be either right on the money, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even a bit low.  Still, some neural connections are pretty clearly time delay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loops, and those can be done much more efficiently that by neural simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This implies that there exist other features that once we understand, we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be able to simulate without replicating all the circuitry.
</em><br>
<p>This is the most important post in this thread.  Cognitive processes
<br>
are optimized for the kinds of computation that neural substrate does
<br>
well.  Even if you knew how many computer-equivalent operations per
<br>
second a typical brain does, you wouldn't know how much computational
<br>
power computer chips require.  Athlon and Intel chips perform
<br>
differently on different kinds of benchmarks.  Neurons will have even
<br>
more significant deviations.  At best you might be able to approximate
<br>
within an order of magnitude.
<br>
<p>There are aspects of synaptic activity that simple circuits don't
<br>
capture, like receptor density, activiation length, that are involved
<br>
in probabilistic integration at the dendrite.  I would lean to the
<br>
side of more bits rather than less to describe a synapse, divided by
<br>
redundancy.
<br>
<p>A reasonable model is Dani's:  10^15 to 10^18 computer-equivalent
<br>
flops.  But even if you have that much processing power, you have to
<br>
know what to do with it.
