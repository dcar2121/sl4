</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I say that an AGI has certain goals, I don't necessarily mean

</em><br>
<em>&gt; * the statement that the AGI is &quot;pursuing&quot; these goals is a fair

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; * the AGI is explicitly involved in an ongoing process of making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself more goal-oriented so that it can better achieve these goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it explicitly conceptualizes
</em><br>
<p>So let's begin to construct a better definition of what's happening here.
<br>
<p>What about the following distinctions:
<br>
<p>1) There are explicit, self-conscious &quot;goals&quot; that the system sets for 
<br>
itself and that it can talk about easily when you ask it &quot;What are you 
<br>
doing this morning?&quot;  [Answer: &quot;Well, my goal for this morning is to 
<br>
finish writing a paper.&quot;]
<br>
<p>2) There is the actual thing it is doing, which we might call a &quot;task 
<br>
goal&quot; that is currently occupying the system's attention, which comes up 
<br>
if we ask &quot;What are you actually doing right now?&quot;  [Answer:  &quot;Okay, so 
<br>
I got distracted and so what I am actually doing right now is writing a 
<br>
message to reply to one of Ben's posts.&quot;]
<br>
<p>3) The above two points highlight the fact that the system can have many 
<br>
of these goals hanging around, functioning on different timescales.  I 
<br>
have a work list that has a couple of hundred house-maintenance, house 
<br>
renovation and other tasks on it, but it impinges on my behavior in 
<br>
various ways.  Even if these are goals that operate on a timescale of 
<br>
years, what makes them similar to other ones is that I can explicitly 
<br>
articulate them.
<br>
<p>4) Might there also be other goals that I cannot articulate because they 
<br>
work underneath the surface?  That I cannot articulate (even if my 
<br>
therapist might be able to)?   This is difficult:  let's make a category 
<br>
for this type of goal, even though I think in the end there may not be 
<br>
any that belong in this category rather than in the next one..........
<br>
<p>5) Motivations.  I would distinguish between these and goals.  Right now 
<br>
I am swayed in my behavior by some nebulous &quot;dispositions&quot; that I want 
<br>
to satisfy.  One is gustatory pleasure (I come to a coffee shop to work, 
<br>
where I can get a pot of tea to sip while I am writing).  One is human 
<br>
company (the coffee shop has people in who I don't often interact with, 
<br>
but who have something I need, which is perhaps the sound of voices and 
<br>
activity).  One is the need to achieve something intellectual, or to 
<br>
make a mark upon the world, or to be noticed by peers .... hence I am 
<br>
driven to write a paper rather than just go dig the garden.
<br>
<p>I could list many other background motivations or drivers that I think 
<br>
contribute to my decision to be here doing this, rather than other 
<br>
things.  I think these are very different from explicit goals because 
<br>
they are (a) hard to articulate, and (b) primal, or out of my control. 
<br>
I do not decide to want gustatory pleasure, I just want it.  The fact 
<br>
that they are hard to articulate means, in my theory of mind, that they 
<br>
are not directly a part of the main area where all the explicit thinking 
<br>
gets done.  They impinge on this area, but are distinct from it.
<br>
<p>6) Motivations are not the end of the process, because there is a system 
<br>
that organizes the motivations.  I don't just let gustatory pleasure 
<br>
drive me all day long, I wax and wane between the various motivations. 
<br>
There are saturation and novelty seeking mechanisms at work here:  too 
<br>
much of one motivation starts to make me want to do something different.
<br>
<p><p>The interaction between the motivational system and the place where all 
<br>
the contents-of-consciousness stuff goes on (the &quot;foreground,&quot; in my 
<br>
terminology) is of greatest interest to me.  It is not simply a matter 
<br>
of some motivation marching and putting an explicit goal on top of the 
<br>
goal stack:  the motivational system is dumb, so it cannot know exactly 
<br>
how to do this.  There is a coupling between the two, but it is quite loose.
<br>
<p>How, for example, does a nine-month old child have an episode of the 
<br>
&quot;rebellious independence&quot; motivation when it does not yet have the 
<br>
concepts to put a &quot;rebel!&quot; goal on its goal stack and then try to work 
<br>
out a plan of action that satisfies that goal?  I watched this happen in 
<br>
my son (and then watched and saw the character streak develope from that 
<br>
point on, so it was real, that first time), and I find it fascinating 
<br>
that the motivation was there before the concepts that he could have 
<br>
used to discuss it.  This is a very abstract example, I know, but it 
<br>
cuts right to the heart of the problem.
<br>
<p><p>Sorry for the ramble.  I'll turn it into a paper soon.  I especially 
<br>
want to disect your own comments about how you see the significance of 
<br>
the term &quot;goals&quot;, which seems to be sort of operationalist or behaviorist.
<br>
<p>[Sigh: another paper for the goal stack]
