<p>
Woody,
<br>
<p>Certainly, the goal of the Novamente design is to have a full semantic
<br>
understanding of the world around it.
<br>
<p>Right now, the existing Novamente system is pretty dumb in practical
<br>
terms -- we are teaching it stuff like how to play fetch and the fact
<br>
that object still exist when it's not looking at  them.  However, the
<br>
learning algorithms in the system are very powerful (as has been shown
<br>
by applying them in data mining and other domains besides AGI), and we
<br>
believe that as we further build out the architecture and teach the
<br>
system it will get smarter and smarter, in the manner of a human baby.
<br>
<p>But, even the current NM system's understanding is better described as
<br>
semantic than syntactic, since it is interpreting percepts and
<br>
generating actions based on it a desire to achieve goals using its
<br>
simulated embodiment, rather than just operating within a disembodied
<br>
formal system.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To give just a hint of how these distinctions manifest themselves in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fleshed-out AGI design, in Novamente:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Goertzel,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a fellow designer, I must say wow, you are well on your way. The more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts of yours I read here about Novemente, the more impressed I am with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your development of machine intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without reference to the analogy, perhaps you would be interested in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phone conversation I had with Professor Searle yesterday. Here was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart of it -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WL: A syntactical machine can never be conscious. Correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS: Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WL: And semantical machines that have a semantic understanding of their I/O
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are conscious. Correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS: Yes. And that's the question. How do you get this semantic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WL: Exactly! That's the key point. And my prototype of my invention is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing just that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS: Then send it to me. (*In a stern tone that implied 'I will believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I see it.'*)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Irregardless of whether this is true, I feel curious to ask you, though you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not want to discuss such details, simply put: Has Novamente crossed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great divide between syntactical, simulatory Classical Machines, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Post-Classical strong AI conscious machines?  In other words, does it have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a semantical understanding of its language inputs and outputs, or is it an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely clever / ingenious syntactical simulation of intelligence? Either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, congratulations! It is solid evidence that machine intelligence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close at hand ...
</em><br>
