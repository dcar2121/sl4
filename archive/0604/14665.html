Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The one big distinction that I enforce, but which you might not do, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between what is in the background (not being thought about or perceived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or deployed in any way) and what is in the foreground .... the latter is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sum total of what the system is thinking about (contents of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness).  Why the distinction?  Because I believe in putting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; latter in a place where there is very rapid and extensive connectivity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so these things can link together and interact.
</em><br>
<p>That is precisely the point of the separate memory unit we call the
<br>
AttentionalFocus, which deals only with currently highly &quot;important&quot;
<br>
entities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, when I talked about STM having perhaps thousands of things in it, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was referring to the thing I have called the &quot;foreground&quot; here.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understand, and this notion exists in Novamente (we call it
<br>
AttentionalFocus rather than &quot;foreground&quot;), but it's not an identical
<br>
notion to the STM that psychologists hypothesize to (phrased loosely)
<br>
have a capacity of 7+/-2 distinct items...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The foreground is not necessarily an undifferentiated module:  it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to have several semi-specialized subcompartments (various aspects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of language processing, for example), so this sounds a bit like what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call &quot;units of the memory corresponding to particular 'interaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channels'&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>We have InteractionChannel-specific AttentionalFocii, and also a generic one
<br>
<p>(in the grand NM design, I mean -- the currently implemented NM in
<br>
fact has only one memory unit, but that is a matter of configuration,
<br>
we have chosen a simple one for initial experimentation)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to the chunking issue (the magic number seven), here is what I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening:  the foreground is allowed a ration, when it comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; configurations of items that are not strongly grounded by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections to immediate sensory input or motor output, but which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead floating free and independent of one another.
</em><br>
<p>In Novamente, a 7+/-2 type number may or may not emerge from the
<br>
system's dynamics -- we haven't really run enough of the right
<br>
experiments to find out.
<br>
<p>If it does emerge, it will be from the notion of a &quot;map&quot; -- a
<br>
collection of coordinatedly-tightly-interacting memory items.  It may
<br>
be that there is some kind of emergent limit to the number of maps
<br>
that arises in the AttentionalFocus memory unit at any given point in
<br>
time.  If so we should discover this in our experimentation during the
<br>
next year, unless funding crises intervene and push our staffing even
<br>
lower....
<br>
<p>-- Ben
