This appears to have been straight-up spam, and as such I'm doing a
<br>
Bad Thing by forwarding it, but it's obviously SL4 related, in as
<br>
much as we need to know our enemy.  Or at least our loons.

<p>Subject: My new book about technology change was released today

<p>Dear friends and associates,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'm writing to tell you about my new book, &quot;Future Hype: The Myths of
<br>
Technology Change,&quot; which is being released today.  I've devoted most of my
<br>
time since leaving Microsoft eight years ago to the book's creation, so this
<br>
is an exciting moment for me.
<br>
<p>A summary of the book is below, but here's the short version: The Internet
<br>
and PC are not that big a deal.  Learn how technology change really works,
<br>
how it will impact us in the future, and how to be a smarter technology
<br>
consumer.
<br>
<p>I've already gotten some nice national press.  It's in this week's US News
<br>
and World Report, an hour-long interview is in the queue for the New
<br>
Dimensions radio show, and it's a nominee for Fast Company's Book of the
<br>
Month for May.
<br>
<p>Amazon has become a major component in a successful book launch, and I'm
<br>
anxious to get a high sales ranking.  If this book sounds interesting to
<br>
you, I'd like you to consider not only buying it, but buying it TODAY.  The
<br>
concentrated sales on a single day should boost it onto Amazon's bestseller
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>It's paperback, and the Amazon price is $10.37.  Order here:
<br>

&lt;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/15767537">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/15767537</a><br>

<br>

<br>
<p>If this link doesn't work for you, go to www.amazon.com and search for
<br>
&quot;Future Hype.&quot; 
<br>
<p>And if I could beg one more favor, please forward this email to anyone who
<br>
is interested in technology and might also benefit from this book -- from
<br>
the early adopter with every gadget to the technophobe who still hasn't
<br>
bought a computer.
<br>
<p>Much appreciated!
<br>
<p>Bob Seidensticker
<br>
<p>P. S.  At one point or another, we exchanged an e-mail or more.  That might
<br>
have been a while ago, so my apologies if this seems out of the blue!
<br>

<br>
<p>SUMMARY
<br>
<p>Conventional wisdom says that technology change is exponential, giving us an
<br>
ever-growing number of exciting new products. According to this view, we
<br>
live in an unprecedented golden age of technological expansion. But this is
<br>
not so. Today's achievements are not unprecedented. Technology change is not
<br>
exponential.  The Next Big Thing is not inevitable.  And the PC and Internet
<br>
are no more important than any major invention of the past.
<br>
<p>We've been deceived about technology change.  As a result, we ignore how
<br>
much it really costs.  Future Hype explodes the myths, reveals the high and
<br>
often hidden costs, and shows how to be a smarter technology consumer.  Only
<br>
by seeing technology correctly can we hope to use it correctly.
