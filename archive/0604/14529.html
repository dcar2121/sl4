<p><em>&gt;  Hmm, don't know enough about the second to comment at all... on the third,

<em>&gt; why would the alternatives be better than using extra neurotransmitters?
</em><br>
<p>Simplicity, efficiency, energy conservation.  Since you have to build
<br>
a different receptor for each neurotransmitter, why not just build
<br>
different receptors that respond to the same molecule but transduce
<br>
the signal differently.  &gt;100 neurotransmitters, at least 80 of which
<br>
are non-peptides, require their own biosynthetic pathways (although
<br>
some of them overlap, such as tyrosine -&gt; L-dopa -&gt; dopamine -&gt;
<br>
epinephrine -&gt; norepinephrine, the last three of which are all used as
<br>
neurotransmitters, but most of them are independent pathways). 
<br>
Assuming that there are on average three enzymes necessary to get from
<br>
a precursor to a finished neurotransmitter product, that's an extra
<br>
300 genes which take up cellular resources.  By no coincidence, about
<br>
half of the genes in the genome are expressed in the brain, more than
<br>
in any other organ.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The first is an interesting question... neural signals appear inefficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of raw speed, but they are extraordinarily efficient in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy expended per bit sent, far more so than anything we can build today.
</em><br>
<p>Is that true?  I don't know.  According to a number of sources
<br>
(<a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/JacquelineLing.shtml">http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/JacquelineLing.shtml</a>), the brain
<br>
consumes about 23 J/s.  In other words, it's a 23 W processor with a
<br>
capacity of about 10^15 to 10^18 computer-equivalent flops.  How much
<br>
power does a typical microchip draw?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is that inherent to the method of transmission? Or is there a way to be both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast and energy efficient with direct electric current signals given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently advanced nanotechnology?
</em><br>
<p>The savings is probably due to efficiency.  Chips expend a lot of heat
<br>
because they use resistance for processing.  That's just wasted
<br>
energy, aka cost.  Your head doesn't heat up to 80C (or whatever) when
<br>
you think.  If nanotechnology continues to use resistance, don't
<br>
expect it to be as efficient.
<br>
<p>It doesn't matter whether signal transduction through neurons is
<br>
energy efficient by the standards of computer scientists, or any other
<br>
standard.  It is adaptive only because it is fast.  A voltage change
<br>
can be propagated down a myelinated axon at 100 m/s.  That's way
<br>
faster than any other type of signaling, like hormones, which is
<br>
dependent on diffusion rates or blood flow.  That doesn't, however,
<br>
mean that it's the most efficient design that we could come up with if
<br>
we could manipulate the elements of neurochemistry ourselves.
