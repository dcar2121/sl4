</em><br>
<p>Quite plausibly.  The question would be, however, &quot;In what chunk complexity do 
<br>
problems exist?&quot; (tying it back into the thread topic).  If problems of 
<br>
complexity 5 are the highest that exist, then a limit of you only being able 
<br>
to simultaneously process 5 chunks would not limit the problems whose 
<br>
solution you could understand (though it *might* slow down the 
<br>
comprehension).  If, however, there were a problem that required 
<br>
simultaneously dealing with 6 or 7 chunks, then you couldn't understand it no 
<br>
matter how long you tried. 
<br>
<p>Now the proof of the four color theorum isn't, itself, proof of such 
<br>
complexity.  It could be that it's the sheer length of the proof that defeats 
<br>
us.  Do note, however, that symbolic logic is so structured that one only 
<br>
considers two chunks at any one time.  I.e., formal logic methods are either 
<br>
of the form x = f(y) or of the form x = f(y, z).  The required number of 
<br>
parameters is the inherent chunk complexity.   If it has been shown that 
<br>
every function can be reduced to a form that is not more complex than those, 
<br>
then chunk complexity isn't a limitation.  I believe that it's been shown 
<br>
that boolean functions can always be so decomposed...though I can't remember 
<br>
*why* I believe this, but not all functions are boolean.  (OTOH, computer 
<br>
programming is a good indication that boolean functions can, at least, be a 
<br>
good model for all other functions.)
<br>
<p>I think that I've just argued that one can always exchange chunk complexity 
<br>
for serial complexity.  And serial complexity can be handled by external 
<br>
libraries.  Given that my (vague) arguments are correct, then the thread 
<br>
proposal is correct (though &quot;... Just a Bit Slow&quot; seems like an 
<br>
understatement.
<br>
<p>The key question is CAN x = f (y, z, w) always be rewritten as x = g (y, h(z, 
<br>
w) )?  Not can it be done in a reasonably efficient way, but can it always be 
<br>
done at all.  And then can this be generalized to arbitrarily higher 
<br>
dimensionality.  If those are both correct, then the hypothesis is correct, 
<br>
and my initial reaction was incorrect.
