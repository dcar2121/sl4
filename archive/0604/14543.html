It looks as though Seidensticker isn't an idiot or a sensationalist.
<br>
Although of course he wants to sell his new book.  :)

<br>
Much of what he says in this interview resonates with me, as I also
<br>
have little time for the people who constantly chase after the latest
<br>
'must-have' gadget, phone, dvd, game, etc.

<p>Quotes:
<br>
<p>What's wrong with new technologies?
<br>
<p>The biggest problem is the hidden cost. When you buy a computer, you
<br>
are not actually buying just the computer—you are purchasing
<br>
computerization. I just bought a laptop, and I'll probably get rid of
<br>
it in two years. So, I spend about $500 per year on laptops. But the
<br>
actual cost of having the laptop is about 10 times that. We often
<br>
forget the other costs: software, updating software, learning to use
<br>
the new software, self-support, peer support. We spend about $300
<br>
billion per year just for time spent tweaking, adjusting, and learning
<br>
to use our computers.
<br>
------------------------
<br>
<p>Is this an age of unprecedented technology growth?
<br>
<p>Technology is changing. But it has been changing for centuries, and we
<br>
often misperceive that our change is faster than previous periods. For
<br>
example, in the 40 years that preceded the building of the Empire
<br>
State Building, the record skyscraper height increased by a factor of
<br>
4. In the next 40 years, that factor didn't increase at all. We saw an
<br>
explosive growth in the field of civic engineering. Then that growth
<br>
faded into a period of maturity for construction of dams, skyscrapers,
<br>
and telephone grids. We saw a similar explosion with the Internet, but
<br>
that too is fading into the background and will be replaced by
<br>
something else.
