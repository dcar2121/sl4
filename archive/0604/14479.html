No, Aj is correct.  When our brain matter is destroyed, we die.  The continuity Aj is referring to is not the discontinuity that occurs five minutes after I drink a cup of coffee, vs the sleepy state I'm in before I drink it.  Both pre and post caffeine, I'm still the same individual in this context.  The continuity Aj was referring to breaking was that which occurs when the matter/energy of our brains is not comprising a person after we die.  Dave, there is continuity of self.  It is not 100%, but it is pretty close.  That is because one *evolutionary advantage* is the laying down of accurate memories for the benefit of one's future self to access.  We get to abstarctly time-travel forwards and backwards in time without leaving the present.  Yay, continuity.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In my Opinion Aj, uploading for immortality is the biggest farce I've seen seriously discussed in these circles.  I also believe any upload (obviously creating a separate individual with a separate identity) must exhibit similiar chemical and electromagnetic behaviours to what we observe occuring in animal nervous systems, for it to possess consciousness.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Every morning when you wake up, you are a new person with memories of your 
<br>
old life, believing yourself to be the same. Why then, this illusion of 
<br>
continuity, of I-ness, of a &quot;soul&quot;? Because in civilization, it was a 
<br>
tremendous evolutionary advantage be willing to endure some hardship or 
<br>
discomfort today for the sake of your future self. Thus we evolved an ego.
