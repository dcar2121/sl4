<p>
To give just a hint of how these distinctions manifest themselves in a
<br>
fleshed-out AGI design, in Novamente:
<br>
<p>1) items in all memory units are associated with various importance
<br>
indices, e.g. &quot;short term importance&quot;, &quot;medium term importance&quot;, &quot;long
<br>
term importance&quot; -- and these indices are continuous-valued not
<br>
discrete
<br>
<p>2) in additional to the main memory unit, there is also a specialized
<br>
unit of the memory devoted only to items with very high short or
<br>
medium term importance  [but note that a memory, if represented as a
<br>
distributed pattern across many elementary knowledge-items, may
<br>
sometimes be present in this specialized unit but only to a lesser
<br>
degree than in the main memory unit]
<br>
<p>3) there are units of the memory corresponding to particular
<br>
&quot;interaction channels&quot;, containing memory items recently useful for
<br>
dealing with that interaction channel (this covers perception/action
<br>
specific STM)
<br>
<p>4) in all units of the memory, there are caches that enable rapid
<br>
access to recently accessed items [another kind of &quot;STM&quot;, one could
<br>
say]
<br>
<p>We have not tried to imitate the way the human brain handles the
<br>
STM/LTM distinction (which no one really understands) but have tried
<br>
to handle it in a rational and workable manner.

<em>&gt; &gt; If you think that

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a) you are flat wrong, and making an assertion refuted by experimetns
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; already,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; b) you are not defining STM in the same way as is standard in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cognitive psychology currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I assume that b) is probably the case...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, this may be fine: perhaps, for example, your definition of STM may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correspond better to brain structure than the standard definition. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; area of STM/working-memory/whatever-you-want-to-call-it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subject of plenty of debate in contemporary cog psych.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But I would be curious for you to clarify exactly what your definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Please note, it is not obvious that a mind needs to have a rigid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; STM/LTM distinction.  Novamente does not exactly have such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distinction, though it has a couple different distinctions that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; somewhat related to this one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is b), of course, but I don't think the literature is as clear cut as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you suggest:  the presence of a large number of &quot;partially-activated&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts is what I have in mind, and although people do not normally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refer to this as STM, the distinctions that *they* make between STM and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever place these partial activations are situated is not so clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They would like it to be LTM, but partialy activated, and I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (repeatedly) chalenged them to be clear about the whys and wherefores of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that way of looking at it, without much success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am stretching the concept of STM, but I am doing so in a way that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive psychologists would not say is wrong, just open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation.  They do not often want to get into a discussion about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the distinction I am making here, because it is difficult for them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of experiments to clarify the distinction, but if I take a &lt;let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build a system that actually works&quot;&gt; perspective, I find that this issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes up immediately, whether or not they can address it experimentally.
