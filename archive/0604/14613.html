<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ricardo is spot on.  There has been extensive work done analyzing what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a goal is, what types of goals humans and nonhumans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems-in-general have or might have or should have, intentionality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation, and self-deception about goals.  The usual suspects --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology, computer science, economics, et al. -- are all involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For one to attempt to discuss goals seriously without having read up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this background material is an instance of a general sort of error
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most commonly made by those who have never studied any particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field in depth, and hence don't grok that for almost every interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic, and actually many uninteresting topics, much has already been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; written that they *must* become familiar with before anyone who *is*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledgable in the area will listen to anything they have to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and, perhaps more importantly, they must become familiar with it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid reinventing wheels, re-committing known mistakes, and otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; churning away without contributing to any real progress in the field).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's good that some people are recognizing that people have a tendency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward armchair theorizing without getting specific, technical, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise utile via a more formal, precise approach.  But to suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way out of this is to reinvent definitions and ontologies related
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 'goals', void of prior work, is ... no better? ... no, it's better,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's progress... but it's not better enough to have shrugged off the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;complete waste of time&quot; crown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If methodologies, in addition to subject matter, were to have 'shock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels', this one would be decidedly 0.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That said, let me reiterate that I am entirely supportive of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intention (&quot;1&quot; in your list); it's the &quot;2&quot; in play that needs an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upgrade.
</em><br>
<p>I have read quite a few of the different categories that you mention, 
<br>
and I have an ongoing task to pull these together into a form that can 
<br>
be used to design real systems, .... but much of the literature comes 
<br>
with heavy ontological baggage that makes it very difficult to *use* 
<br>
that previous work to build a working motivational system.
<br>
<p>&quot;Difficult&quot; is a polite way of putting it.  The less polite way is that 
<br>
the literature is a joke.  I have read it, and I am not reinventing the 
<br>
wheel, I am inventing a wheel that actually makes sense and does not 
<br>
involve assumptions that are ridiculous.
<br>
<p>(Want an example?  Go to the literature and find a proposed 
<br>
goal/motivational system that does *not* presuppose that the cognitive 
<br>
system already has a sophisticated, semi-adult semantic representation 
<br>
of the world, grounded in some way.  You need to find a system that 
<br>
avoids this assumption if you are going to hope to build a neonate 
<br>
cognitive system that is able to learn its own concepts, because the 
<br>
neonate will need a motivational system if it is to function, but it 
<br>
doesn't have the adult semantic representations so it has nothing 
<br>
sensible to put on its goal stack.  There are various ways one might 
<br>
circumvent this problem, but most of them involve methods for defining 
<br>
motivations independently of the cognitive system, and setting up a way 
<br>
to let the one link into the other during development.  How many papers 
<br>
in the literature discussing this explicit and crucial issue?  Zero. 
<br>
How many that allude to it in a particular context, where someone is 
<br>
already making many assumptions about how the cognitive system works, 
<br>
most of which are no longer accepted...?  Well, there are some such 
<br>
papers because I occasionally come across them, but their solutions are 
<br>
virtually useless in the general case.)
<br>
<p>(A P.S. on that example:  I tried to confine it in one paragraph, but I 
<br>
hope we can take it as read that I know it has more depth to it).
<br>
<p>Someone once accused me of being negligent because I refused to learn 
<br>
all the gory details of what was going in modern behaviorist research 
<br>
before dismissing it.  I disagreed then, and I say the same thing now 
<br>
(and I have Eliezer on my side here, since he once used exactly the same 
<br>
argument ;-)):  I can know enough about what is going on in a field to 
<br>
know that the majority of it is such a waste of time that I would be 
<br>
better off reinventing [sic] it from scratch.
<br>
<p>My previous post was just a way of getting the discussion going and 
<br>
provoking some thoughts from other people.  I might have given the 
<br>
impression that I was making this stuff up on the spur of the moment, 
<br>
and although I can understand how someone might see it that way, it is 
<br>
not true.  I guess my choice of words did not help:  &quot;So let's begin to 
<br>
construct a better definition of what's happening here......&quot; was not 
<br>
meant to be a serious beginning, more a rhetorical device.
