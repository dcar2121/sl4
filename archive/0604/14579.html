</em><br>
<p>I think this is the critical point (no pun intended) in this argument.
<br>
&nbsp;We should distinguish between 2 types of Singularity.
<br>
<p>The classic Singularity, as popularized by Vinge and now Kurzweil (I
<br>
think Ben G. said that Von Neumann used the term in the same way?), is
<br>
that the Singularity is a divide by zero on the timeline, the place at
<br>
which you can't calculate the summed change because your calculations
<br>
go to infinity.  This relies on exponential curves.
<br>
<p>The Singularity that Ben is talking about is linked to specific
<br>
technologies.  As anticipated by several people on this list, it is
<br>
linked most specifically to AI.  The notion is that once we reach
<br>
smarter-than-human AI, it will bootstrap itself, making exponential
<br>
gains, so that within a matter of days life as we know it could
<br>
disappear.
<br>
<p>I don't think this is inevitable, because I think AI will gradually
<br>
accumulate domains in which it is smarter than humans, rather than
<br>
crossing the border all at once.  Nonetheless this &quot;all at once&quot;
<br>
notion is what we need a new name for.  It is distinct from the
<br>
classic Singularity in several ways:
<br>
<p>- It doesn't depend on whether technological change is increasing or
<br>
decreasing at the time it happens.
<br>
- It doesn't provide any acclimatization period during which people
<br>
get used to the exponential curve.
<br>
- It doesn't provide any warning.
<br>
<p>It isn't a smooth curve.  On the timeline, it's more like a wall. 
<br>
Technological change may increase or decrease; it really doesn't
<br>
matter - whatever rate of change humans achieve won't prepare them for
<br>
the day Humanity hits the Wall.
