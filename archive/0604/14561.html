As I see it the PC and the Internet , which are obviously not two distinct
<br>
things, are nothing more than the current state of the evolution of
<br>
technologically mediated human language and logic. This technology is only
<br>
one more technology, yet it is also a greater technology that has been made
<br>
possible by the technology that came before it through a process of memetic
<br>
natural selection (AKA science). Do we say that this technology is greater
<br>
than the invention of writing or the steam engine? Although the Internet (to
<br>
include the entire global telecommunications infrastructure) would not be
<br>
possible without all of the world-changing technologies that came before it,
<br>
it is still the greatest technology. It is the exponential rise in power of
<br>
machines that mediate human language that facilitate the exponential rise in
<br>
power of all other technologies. In this sense all technologies prior to the
<br>
Internet were nothing more than faint adumbration of the Globalizing
<br>
technologies of the present which now promise to advance at speeds that have
<br>
never before even been imagined. And that is why the Internet is a &quot;big
<br>
deal&quot;. Those who are engaged in linear thinking need to awake from their
<br>
dogmatic slumber. The Internet portends AGI and technological singularity
<br>
which raises questions that make people very uncomfortable. So anyone
<br>
selling a book that assuages that basic fear and tries to explain away the
<br>
current state of technology as just like any other era of technology is, in
<br>
my opinion, doing a disservice.
