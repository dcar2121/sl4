<p>&nbsp;[Meanwhile, a SETS could be maintaining the mega systems of earth  
<br>
&nbsp;such as electric grids, nuclear power plants, weather systems,
<br>
transportation
<br>
systems, etc., plus actively advance all sciences, such as food  
<br>
science, medical science, the space exploration sciences, etc.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, it would not because the decision on what to use its abilities  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for would be left in the hands of the monkeys in your ideal outcome.
</em><br>
<p>[The human values involved in these decisions are simple, constant, and
<br>
uncontroversial.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have been paying attention as the current US administration  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undercuts and largely ignores the input of science haven't you?   The  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human determination of relevant priorities and goals is extremely  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous.   Nothing is more controversial than when the facts are  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in agreement with the desires of the alpha monkeys.
</em><br>
<p>The SETS tasks I have listed above are simple settled values, except for
<br>
the decision of more or less. If we had a SETS today it could get started
<br>
without controversy or backlash - whose human values is it offending?  As
<br>
far as more or less, I can't imagine for example a US TS being built, and
<br>
then the US &quot;monkeys&quot; sitting back and letting the TS be the controlling
<br>
ordainer of how their money is spent. It will ADVISE them on the benefits
<br>
and drawbacks of more or less, but not even the US &quot;monkeys&quot; are going to
<br>
give it the decision-making final word on how their money is spent, no
<br>
matter if its a SETS or a VPTS with values programs it wants to spend our
<br>
money on. I simply don't see the US people EVER, IN ANY WAY, agreeing to
<br>
this, or worse yet, being forced into things by a VPTS. 
<br>
<p>Thus I can only conclude that it will always be a democracy-driven
<br>
government decision, or as you put it, it will always be in the &quot;hands of
<br>
the monkeys.&quot; How much more dangerous will it be with a pet VPTS for the
<br>
&quot;angry young men&quot; or &quot;monkeys&quot; to play with? I must conclude at this time
<br>
that it would probably be catastrophic, and so I stand by my support of a
<br>
SETS over a VPTS, as the safer of these two paradigms.
