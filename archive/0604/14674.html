<p>
Danni and Mikko,
<br>
<p>With the greatest of respect to you both, I have to say that you are not 
<br>
addressing the point that I made.
<br>
<p>Printing, PCs and the rest are just optimizations of human potential: 
<br>
yes, fantastic in the context of the first 500,000 years of our species, 
<br>
but all previous invention was done by human brains, and the impact on 
<br>
human brain creativity and productivity has been *relatively* (and I use 
<br>
the word with precision here) small compared to what would happen if the 
<br>
creative process were transferred to new kinds of minds that operated at 
<br>
speeds much greater than our own.
<br>
<p>For example:  suppose we could build minds that simply worked at a 
<br>
million times the speed of our own (not necessary smarter, just faster). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That would mean that one of these minds could achieve everything that 
<br>
Einstein did in his entire career in about 10 minutes.  A billion times 
<br>
faster machine could do all of that in half a minute.
<br>
<p>Or, looking at it a different way, if someone had managed to complete a 
<br>
superintelligent AGI on, say, January 1st 1670, just after Newton 
<br>
discovered the laws of motion, ALL of the scientific progress that has 
<br>
happened between then and now would have been finished by January 2nd 
<br>
(assuming that we conservatively restrict the self-improvement potential 
<br>
to a factor one billion).
<br>
<p>I'm sorry, but newfangled gadgets and superduper user interfaces are not 
<br>
(without AGI) ever going to improve our efficiency so much that humans 
<br>
will be able to do that.
<br>
<p>(And one could not argue that some kind of non-AGI &quot;brain accelerator&quot; 
<br>
might give us that, because if we understood brains well enough to build 
<br>
such a thing, we would be able to build an AGI).
<br>
<p>When it becomes possible, for the first time, to build something that 
<br>
generates new knowledge in such a way that it is not limited by the 
<br>
speed of the human brain, then you're just not in Kansas any more.
<br>
<p>There is one other point that connects with this:  the improvements we 
<br>
have seen so far might be approaching a human-brain-limited point 
<br>
anyway.  What that means is that it doesn't matter what all those lovely 
<br>
exponential curves from previous technologies are saying, we might be 
<br>
approaching a plateau right now (AGI excepted, of course).

<em>&gt;&gt; Now *that* is not business as usual.  For the first

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That is what the Singularity is all about, and why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it makes no sense to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; say that new technology is not such a big deal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In their aggregate impact, the invention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-to-many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teaching and one-to-many copying have been very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the former, I mean teaching in schools like Plato's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Academy, then re-developed in cathedral schools and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universities in the Middle Ages.  This is in contrast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the apprenticeship system where knowledge was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distributed linearly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the latter, I mean first block printing, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movable type printing, versus manuscript copying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both developments made the transfer of knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponentially faster.  Since they started from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very small base, it has taken centuries to build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up literacy and large libraries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The internet/web/google/word processing, etc. type
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tools I estimate has made me twice as productive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the kind of knowledge work I do, relative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the advent of desktop PCs, but that improvement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has come in a couple of decades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the spread of literacy and university-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; education to more countries in the past 20 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's arguable whether the PC-based improvements are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dominant effect yet, but at some point it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, in the physical realm, manufacturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productivity has doubled in 13 years in the US:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we're well on our way to a fully-automated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; production environment, shortly to be followed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automated transportation and retail delivery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (think shelf-stocking robots and automated french
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fry and hamburger machines).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are all those low-skilled people going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing in that environment?
