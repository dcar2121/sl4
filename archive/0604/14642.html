</em><br>
<p>I would guess that that is in fact what human brains do already - a
<br>
very large proportion of our computational power is spent deciding
<br>
what to pay attention to.  Evolution isn't complexity-bound; it's
<br>
energy-bound.  Complex algorithms that are energy efficient are
<br>
likely.
<br>
<p>Given the fact that humans have very large long-term memory stores
<br>
relative to what they can hold in &quot;working memory&quot; at one time, the
<br>
limitation on working memory is not brain volume.  The limitation is
<br>
so small that I would guess it is either that
<br>
<p>- the method of activating a memory is such that activation of one
<br>
memory interferes with activating others - very likely, given what we
<br>
know of neural networks
<br>
<p>- the computational complexity, as well as the number of
<br>
interconnections, needed to deal with the 5 or so chunks in working
<br>
memory requires on the same order of neurons as merely storing the
<br>
billions(?) of other chunks in long-term memory - also likely
