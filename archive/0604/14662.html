My read on overly optimistic vs. overly pessimistic failed predictions is
<br>
just the opposite of yours.  IMO, the list of optimistic failures (moon
<br>
bases, etc.) is much longer than the pessimistic failures (DeForest missing
<br>
the impact of TV).  But perhaps we should just agree to disagree here.
<br>
<p>You mention an upcoming paradigm shift.  Can you compare this future
<br>
paradigm shift to ones we've had in the past?  Is it like the &quot;Hey, we can
<br>
mechanize just about *anything*!&quot; during the Industrial Revolution or &quot;Hey,
<br>
electricity can bring power to *lots* of cool appliances!&quot; after
<br>
electricity?  Or is it much bigger than these?
<br>
<p>As to your last questions: sure, the Discovery Engine would be a really,
<br>
really big deal.  &quot;Extraordinary&quot; would be too small a word to describe it.
<br>
I think we're in agreement here.  The disagreement is when.  Since we're not
<br>
there yet, we don't know what potholes (or canyons) lie on the road.  If the
<br>
medium-term future is like the past 200 years (that is, lots of change, but
<br>
not an accelerating amount of change), I think the Discovery Engine will be
<br>
like the mechanical rabbit that greyhounds chase in a race.  
<br>
<p>But, I must admit, the status quo can change.  The Industrial Revolution
<br>
proved that -- it ushered in change in a big way.

Subject: Re: Anti-singularity spam.
<br>
<p><p>Bob,
<br>
<p>Just a couple of thoughts.
<br>
<p>1)  You make reference to previous technology, and to technology curves, but
<br>
I (unlike people like Kurzweil) place very little credence in those curves,
<br>
and on the previous history of predictions.  You cite &quot;the long history of
<br>
failed technology predictions,&quot; but as I am sure you are aware, for every
<br>
book that lists the failed predictions there are dozens of books that
<br>
catalog the _negative_ predictions that turned out to be too pessimistic:
<br>
Arthur C Clarke's estimate for the first moon landing, the Wright brothers'
<br>
pessimism a few months before they succeeded, and (my personal favorite):
<br>
Lee DeForest getting prosecuted for fraud because he said that radio
<br>
transmission across the Atlantic would soon be possible..... and then later
<br>
in life, himself dismissing television as virtually impossible.
<br>
<p>2)  To me, as someone working in the field, the failure of SHRDLU and Deep
<br>
Blue to lead straight to AI is of no importance whatsoever.  You
<br>
ask:  &quot;Who could look at [SHRDLU] and think that general natural language
<br>
interaction with computers was not around the corner?&quot; and I
<br>
say:  are you serious?  I admit that as an early student (c. 1980) I was
<br>
impressed by SHRDLU, but it took only a couple of years' work in the area to
<br>
reach the point where I realized this was a dead end, and all the other
<br>
cognitive scientists around me said the same thing in personal discussion.
<br>
<p>Given what I know of the field, I think that what we are waiting for is a
<br>
paradigm shift:  a change in the way we think about the problem, after which
<br>
it will suddenly seem surprising and comical that we all thought it was so
<br>
very difficult.  I think this could have happened already, back in the
<br>
mid-1980s.  I think it could happen tomorrow (literally). 
<br>
My best guess (just because I like the fun of guessing and being right :-),
<br>
not because I am fond of exact predictions) is that the breakthrough will
<br>
come in the next five years or so.
<br>
<p><p><p>Overall, you couch your reply in interestingly evasive language.  You try to
<br>
imagine the event I described as happening, at best, a lot further away in
<br>
the future than we think...... but you avoid saying whether, *when* it
<br>
actually occurs, it would be qualitatively different from all previous
<br>
technology, for the precise reasons I gave.
<br>
<p>If I pressed you on this point, would you not agree that since this
<br>
technology would change the fundamental nature of the technology generation
<br>
process in the most extraordinary way, it would be completely different from
<br>
all that came before it?

it wasn't.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, you could respond that we may haggle over *when* we will 
</em><br>

</em><br>
Possibly.
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see innovation taking a huge step with the Industrial Revolution.  
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; change before roughly 1800, and fairly constant and fairly large rate

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bob,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for the thoughtful response.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On some of your points I agree with (too much hype about stuff that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turns out to be vapornology), but there is a core point that I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are missing, that seems to undermine your main thesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All previous technologies provided us with something that did not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially change the nature of the discovery process itself.  A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better steam shovel could never cause any individual creative genius 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to suddenly acquire the ability to invent things at ten, a hundred, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thousand times the rate that she was inventing things before the steam
</em><br>
shovel came along.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, someone might say that this is what PCs and the internet are so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at:  they amplify our intelligence in such a way that a given inventor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really could become brighter, more productive, etc.  ...... but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually I would still be on your side and argue against such a claim, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I think the enhancement (or amplification) is fairly marginal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BUT, now imagine that I succeed in building the combination of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware and software that I call a &quot;Discovery Engine&quot;:  a machine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is smart enough to understand the world by itself and invent new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology and make new discoveries (call it an &quot;AI&quot; if you like:  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like to make a distinction here, but that is not too important to the
</em><br>
present point).
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that discovery engine were to be built tomorrow, it would be &quot;used&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to build faster versions of itself, and those would be used to build 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster versions of themselves, and so on in the familiar pattern that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the core thesis of the Singularity idea.  Within a short time, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have systems that produced new inventions at a rate that would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be thousands or millions of times faster than unaided human minds can
</em><br>
achieve.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A thousand times speedup would involve things like:  Einstein wakes up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one morning with no knowledge of physics, then he does some reading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thinking, and by breakfast the next morning he has invented 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special and general relativity.  Or, a million discovery engines start 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working together on the problem of nanotechnology, and a year later 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they deliver a complete system for re-engineering the human body to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make it immune to disease and effectively immortal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now *that* is not business as usual.  For the first time, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology changes the generator of new technology.  Never happened 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before.  Not just more of the same, but a whole new ball game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is what the Singularity is all about, and why it makes no sense 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say that new technology is not such a big deal.
