<p>
I suggest that there will only be one AGI in the same way an ET would refer
<br>
to the first human they encounter as being representative of Humanity.
<br>
<p>1.  Any AGI that follows the first will be viewed as so similar to the first
<br>
as to be indistinguishable.
<br>
2.  Any self-directed AGI would likely be able to recognize another as a
<br>
resource in the same way that other humans are limited resources or that the
<br>
Internet is a resource.  Assuming the interconnect between two AGI is
<br>
high-bandwidth and low latency, there is no reason why our communication
<br>
with either one of them would not immediately aggregate the knowledge base
<br>
of both or them.  This aggregation would either happen as a result of our
<br>
own double-checking, or they would &quot;compare notes&quot; with each other in an
<br>
effort to evaluate answer fitness.
<br>
<p>If the AGI is based on a distributed architecture such that any sub-system
<br>
is an &quot;expert&quot; at a limited range of knowledge, with the collective whole
<br>
being &quot;the AGI&quot; - then conversing with a single sub-system is an unfair
<br>
measure of the whole in the way that analyzing a single neuron is an unfair
<br>
measure of the function of our entire brain.
<br>
<p>Sorry that until this sentence I did not mention &quot;Goal System&quot; or an
<br>
acronymic buzzword  :)
