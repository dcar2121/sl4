<em>&gt; This sounds to me like you have made my point, because as you say  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value decisions will be &quot;made by highly limited intelligences.&quot; For  
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; will
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me a VPTS will only simply amplify the positions of their

<em>&gt; originating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country. And some day there will be a Chinese TS, Iranian TS, North  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Korean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TS, etc. each I can only imagine pushing their own breed of  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political systems. Electric is thicker then water. So what has been  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gained?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If it sounds like I made you point then I am afraid you completely  
<br>
missed mine.  If we are continuing to fight one another for very  
<br>
human motivations with progressively more advanced technology useable  
<br>
by ever smaller groups then humanity is doomed.  If we attempt to  
<br>
make wise decisions without greater intelligence and control over our  
<br>
EP then we will screw up in more and more disastrous ways, eventually  
<br>
catastrophically.  Game over.  No utopia. No retries.
<br>
<p>Why would we choose not to escape the limits of our evolved  
<br>
psychology and physiology to sufficient degree to at least have a  
<br>
chance of surviving and thriving?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Meanwhile, a SETS could be maintaining the mega systems of earth  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electric grids, nuclear power plants, weather systems, transportation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems, etc., plus actively advance all sciences, such as food  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical science, the space exploration sciences, etc.
</em><br>
<p>No, it would not because the decision on what to use its abilities  
<br>
for would be left in the hands of the monkeys in your ideal outcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The human values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in these decisions are simple, constant, and uncontroversial.
</em><br>
<p>You have been paying attention as the current US administration  
<br>
undercuts and largely ignores the input of science haven't you?   The  
<br>
human determination of relevant priorities and goals is extremely  
<br>
dangerous.   Nothing is more controversial than when the facts are  
<br>
not in agreement with the desires of the alpha monkeys.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is all I mean by a technological systems paradise. And I still have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that a SETS could get us there SAFER, quicker, and easier  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never-ending arguing international VPTSs.
</em><br>
<p><p>Without serious upgrades and or overrides of current human  
<br>
limitations and proclivities you will not get to any kind of paradise  
<br>
or to a future that still has humans in it at even today's level.
