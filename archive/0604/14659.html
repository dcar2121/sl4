</em><br>
<em>&gt; To give just a hint of how these distinctions manifest themselves in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fleshed-out AGI design, in Novamente:
</em><br>
<p>Dr. Goertzel,
<br>
<p>As a fellow designer, I must say wow, you are well on your way. The more
<br>
posts of yours I read here about Novemente, the more impressed I am with
<br>
your development of machine intelligence.
<br>
<p>Without reference to the analogy, perhaps you would be interested in a
<br>
phone conversation I had with Professor Searle yesterday. Here was the
<br>
heart of it -  
<br>
<p>WL: A syntactical machine can never be conscious. Correct? 
<br>
<p>PS: Yes. 
<br>
<p>WL: And semantical machines that have a semantic understanding of their I/O
<br>
are conscious. Correct? 
<br>
<p>PS: Yes. And that's the question. How do you get this semantic
<br>
understanding. 
<br>
<p>WL: Exactly! That's the key point. And my prototype of my invention is
<br>
doing just that.
<br>
<p>PS: Then send it to me. (*In a stern tone that implied 'I will believe it
<br>
when I see it.'*) 
<br>
<p>Irregardless of whether this is true, I feel curious to ask you, though you
<br>
may not want to discuss such details, simply put: Has Novamente crossed the
<br>
great divide between syntactical, simulatory Classical Machines, and
<br>
Post-Classical strong AI conscious machines?  In other words, does it have
<br>
a semantical understanding of its language inputs and outputs, or is it an
<br>
extremely clever / ingenious syntactical simulation of intelligence? Either
<br>
way, congratulations! It is solid evidence that machine intelligence is
<br>
close at hand ...
