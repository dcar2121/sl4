</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<p>Strangely enough, I was in an elevator with Searle a couple of weeks 
<br>
ago, in Tucson.
<br>
<p>I told him he should come to my poster at the (Consciousness) conference 
<br>
were attending, because I was going to present a complete solution of 
<br>
the hard problem of consciousness, and it would be a computational 
<br>
solution.  He grumped that he didn't know what the problem was, and then 
<br>
tried to detour away from me (we had left the elevator by that point) 
<br>
and nearly collided with a table in his haste to escape.
<br>
<p>And he never turned up to my poster!  Poor guy was probably too timid.
<br>
<p>:-) :-) :-)
