<p>Yes - what do you mean &quot;it will turn out somewhat higher once you take

in all the nuances, it always does&quot;?  I don't understand that

statement at all.  It seems to me that you can't say &quot;it always does&quot;

when there is only one phenomenon, not a class of them, under study.

<p>Maybe I am wrong, but as far as neural processing is concerned, I am curious wehther or not it is a class of phenomenona. People talk about other things, and I dont' mean Penroses work, I mean memory in the RNA or something happening in synapses, these things. Maybe it is a class. I should hope it would be only one phenomena that would be very easy and convenient for us. Lots of processing power and very clever algorithms without any weird hardware complications or &quot;tricks&quot;, but I dont know if tricks have been ruled out or not, though most people seem not to believe in them. I hope there are no tricks.
