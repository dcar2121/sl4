</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It's actually even worse (more extreme) than that...sometimes, e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; when my allergies are acting up, I cannot understand thoughts that I

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a variable, and it must allow a certain depth of recursion or stack or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; something.  Somedays I can't understand things that I couldn't on other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If what you say is true (and I have no opinion, though it sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plausible)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, I think I have an opinion. It seems like, on problems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are too complex for us to understand, we can actually make slow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress on them. But each additional piece of information required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the problem requires an exponential increase in the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to understand it. Because information can be made to &quot;shrink&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that we can fit more of it in our working memory. This is a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function of all learning, and it applies to specific problems. It just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; takes repeated exposure to the relevant ideas for them to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habitual, more easily brought to mind, and more easily worked with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So on an issue you're not very familiar with, you might see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charles saw, that you can grasp it in its entirety when you're feeling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially insightful, but that you're not practiced enough with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts to bring them all to mind when you're feeling a bit slow. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with additional familiarization, you'll be able to bring those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts to mind even at a diminished capacity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alternatively, it could be that at some times one's capacity for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational abstract thought is very diminished, but it turns out we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't really use that part of our minds as much as we think, so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only notice it when we try to think about complicated problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, we use habitual neural pathways, and our unconscious mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a lot more than we often realize.

What you describe is chunking, and chunking is definitely necessary.  In fact 
<br>
&quot;proper chunking&quot; is probably one of the hard problems.  What I'm asserting, 
<br>
however, is that chunking isn't sufficient.  For problems at the edge of your 
<br>
ability to solve, you may not be able to chunk them.  If, somehow, you 
<br>
acquire a pre-chunked description (e.g., you solve the problem on a good day) 
<br>
then you may still be able to use the pre-computed chunking on other days, 
<br>
but for problems of a certain inherent complexity, this isn't possible.  This 
<br>
doesn't mean that the problem isn't soluble.  It means it's too 
<br>
recursively(?) deep to hold in active memory, even when it's been chunked.  I 
<br>
can imagine that &quot;external memory&quot; (pencil and paper to pick a familiar 
<br>
example) can provide this temporary external storage that allows one to work 
<br>
on problems too complex to solve directly...but this has limitations in 
<br>
speed, portability, etc.  And in devising reproduceable and recognizable 
<br>
symbols.  Eventually, working beyond our capacity to understand, we arrive at 
<br>
computers and things like the &quot;proof&quot; of the four color theorum.  Proof is in 
<br>
quotes here because NOBODY understands it.  People understand parts of it, 
<br>
and different people understand different parts, so we *may* have a complete 
<br>
coverage.  Perhaps humanity understands that proof, even though no single 
<br>
person does.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Four color theorum proof&quot; was the first example of a &quot;thing&quot; that we 
<br>
believed we knew to be true, but nobody COULD understand exactly WHY we 
<br>
believe it was true.  The standards for a &quot;mathematical proof&quot; changed 
<br>
tremendously with the publication of that proof, and it stands as a &quot;first 
<br>
example&quot; of things that we can't understand because our &quot;intelligence&quot; (i.e. 
<br>
stack depth, active memory size, what have you) is too weak.  Each step of 
<br>
the proof can be understood, but the thing as a whole cannot be.
