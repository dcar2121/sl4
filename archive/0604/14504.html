<p><p>On what grounds do you assert this?  You appear to be saying that  
<br>
neural synchronization processes have no equivalent description in  
<br>
computer science.  Apparently you know a lot more about both neuron  
<br>
behavior and computer science than the rest of us.
<br>
<p>Synchronization at its broadest abstraction has a pretty simple  
<br>
description and well understood mathematics.  What kind of  
<br>
&quot;synchronization&quot; is this that it is outside the scope of  
<br>
conventional mathematics and engineering?  Is it supernatural  
<br>
synchronization?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; There is no computer programming equivalent to the chemistry

</em><br>
<p><p>This statement makes little sense on a couple different levels.  The  
<br>
nature of the machinery is irrelevant to the software abstraction,  
<br>
except as an engineering detail.  Without having any knowledge of the  
<br>
computational fundamentals used by the brain, I can still comfortably  
<br>
say that a silicon equivalent can be implemented in the language of  
<br>
your choice.  Computation in its various forms is fungible.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Computers don't use chemistry, brains do.
</em><br>
<p><p>You seem to think this statement is making some sort of distinction  
<br>
that does not exist.  Chemistry is not magic nor does it have special  
<br>
extra-computational properties, and I have never seen a chemistry- 
<br>
free computer in any case.
<br>
<p><p>Clearly this topic has overwhelmed your imagination and  
<br>
understanding, because you are retreating to the position of ceding  
<br>
everything to the Big Mystery In The Sky and leaving it at that.  It  
<br>
was not constructive when neolithic people did it, and it is not  
<br>
constructive now.  Shock Level 4 indeed.
