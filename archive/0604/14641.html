<p>I agree.  Human short-term memory is small, and evolution tightly 
<br>
complexity-bounded in its algorithms, so why not compare each of 7 items 
<br>
to each of 6 other possible items?  (Since I'm not sure I buy that we're 
<br>
considering all possible sets.)  If you had 20 million items in 
<br>
short-term memory, you'd spend your processing power differently - you'd 
<br>
start asking hard questions about which comparisons were worth carrying 
<br>
out.  The concept of &quot;short-term memory workspace&quot; may disintegrate at 
<br>
such levels.  It may disintegrate much earlier, if you're smart enough 
<br>
to employ a more efficient algorithm than holding only 7 items in 
<br>
storage and comparing them to everything else.
<br>
<p>I think Justin Corwin may have been right when he suggested that humans 
<br>
are so incredibly inefficient, and chimpanzees so incredibly 
<br>
inefficient, that comparing the two provides no evidence whatsoever 
<br>
about the computational complexity of a well-designed intelligence.
