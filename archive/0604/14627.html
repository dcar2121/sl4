<p>
BillK provided some useful feedback.  Yes, it does come across like
<br>
idealistic college-age save the world thinking.  I need to work on
<br>
that, and consider whether it is even practical to convey properly in
<br>
email discussion format.  Yes, I'm idealistic, but that doesn't mean
<br>
I'm naïve.
<br>
<p>Fundamentally, I'm saying that with regard to morality, evolutionary
<br>
selection prevails (and there's nothing intrinsically nice about that)
<br>
and I'm also saying that we have reached a level of development where
<br>
subjective agents can actively and intentionally contribute to the
<br>
process.
<br>
<p>I am also saying that commonly accepted metaethical theories based on
<br>
such ideas as &quot;greatest happiness/good for the greatest number&quot; or
<br>
Kant's categorical imperative, or the Golden Rule, or even &quot;First, do
<br>
no harm&quot; are all incomplete and fail to include or account for
<br>
evolutionary aspects.
<br>
<p>Very recently, work has begun exploring along the lines of social
<br>
darwinism and evolutionary ethics, but it seems to me (and my own
<br>
studies are far from complete) that they are missing, or at least not
<br>
giving proper emphasis to, the essential dual components of morality
<br>
in that it requires both an expanding subjective element (values) and
<br>
an expanding objective element (what works.)
<br>
<p>When I say &quot;increasingly shared values that work over increasing scope
<br>
are increasingly seen as good&quot;, that's shorthand for saying that:
<br>
<p>*  Values are necessarily subjective, they require a &quot;Self&quot;.
<br>
*  Values are necessarily local, they evolve through a process of
<br>
selection within a competitive environment.
<br>
*  Values &quot;that work&quot; (in other words, persist and spread) are
<br>
necessarily considered good (within that local environment.)
<br>
*  Values that work over increasing scope (of interactees, type of
<br>
interactions, and time) are necessarily seen as increasingly good
<br>
(within that local, but expanding environment.)
<br>
<p>So, for example, when we consider the conflicting values of Islam
<br>
versus the west, there is interaction between the two systems, there
<br>
is competition, and there is a *tendency* for the values that work
<br>
best over increasing scope to persist and grow.  This can be seen as
<br>
competition at one level, and as cooperation and growth from a more
<br>
evolved level.  Yes, there will most certainly be losers at one level,
<br>
but the tendency is toward a more effective system overall (for any
<br>
given environment.)
<br>
<p>On a very practical level, it concerns me when I see intelligent and
<br>
inquiring minds suggesting faith in concepts such as stagnant or
<br>
static happiness, moral decision-making based on some narrow, isolated
<br>
or extrapolated model of human values, democratic thinking that
<br>
assumes every agent's ideas have equal &quot;value&quot; without regard to
<br>
fitness, libertarian thinking that assumes that effective action can
<br>
be truly independent, and so on.
<br>
<p>For increasingly effective decision-making, leading to actions that
<br>
will be seen as increasingly good over increasing context, we need to
<br>
be increasingly aware of our subjective values and increasingly aware
<br>
of what increasingly objective principles apply to promoting our
<br>
evolving values into the future.  It's all about evolutionary growth,
<br>
but we've just reached the point where we can play an intentional role
<br>
in the process.
<br>
<p>[If someone can suggest how to factor out the &quot;increasingly's&quot; without
<br>
losing the meaning of growth, I would like to know it.]
<br>
<p>We are now at the point where we have the technology to achieve
<br>
broader and more detailed awareness, based on human values, but
<br>
surpassing the capabilities of any individual human.
<br>
<p>- Jef
