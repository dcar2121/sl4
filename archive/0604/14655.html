Richard:
<br>
<p>Your Discovery Engine is certainly an interesting idea.  Maybe you're right
<br>
and it'll come to pass.  However, think of the long road that AI has
<br>
traveled.  I'm sure many on this list know of SHRDLU (1970), Terry
<br>
Winograd's natural language project.  It was a very simple graphical
<br>
interface, but you interacted with it with real English (Wikipedia has a
<br>
summary and sample dialog: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU</a>).  As an
<br>
impressionable college student shortly afterwards, this was pretty amazing
<br>
stuff.  Who could look at this and think that general natural language
<br>
interaction with computers was not around the corner?  And yet, it wasn't.
<br>
36 years later, it's still a dream.
<br>
<p>Deep Blue beat the world chess champion in 1997, but that had been &quot;10 years
<br>
away&quot; for close to 50 years.
<br>
<p>Of course, you could respond that we may haggle over *when* we will create
<br>
this amazing technology, but the *if* is no longer a question.  Possibly.
<br>
But the when could still be quite far into the future.  History has examples
<br>
where inventors overreached -- Babbage's Analytic Engine or Da Vinci's
<br>
submarine, for example.  It's hard to envision the sound barrier (that is,
<br>
unexpected and really hard) types of problems that we'll discover on this
<br>
road.
<br>
<p>I see innovation taking a huge step with the Industrial Revolution.  Lots of
<br>
things changed at that time.  Instead of an exponentially-rising Technology
<br>
Change curve through time, I see the graph as a step function -- fairly
<br>
constant and fairly small rate of change before roughly 1800, and fairly
<br>
constant and fairly large rate of change after roughly 1830 or so.  If I
<br>
could translate your thoughts into my worldview, you may be envisioning yet
<br>
another big step up perhaps 50 years in the future.  (I'm just thinking out
<br>
loud here, so I could be misrepresenting you.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Given the long history of failed technology predictions (and the bolder, the
<br>
more likely to fail), I remain skeptical.  But I applaud the efforts of
<br>
those working to make it happen.
<br>

Subject: Re: Anti-singularity spam.
<br>
<p><p>Bob,
<br>
<p>Thanks for the thoughtful response.
<br>
<p>On some of your points I agree with (too much hype about stuff that turns
<br>
out to be vapornology), but there is a core point that I think you are
<br>
missing, that seems to undermine your main thesis.
<br>
<p>All previous technologies provided us with something that did not
<br>
substantially change the nature of the discovery process itself.  A better
<br>
steam shovel could never cause any individual creative genius to suddenly
<br>
acquire the ability to invent things at ten, a hundred, or a thousand times
<br>
the rate that she was inventing things before the steam shovel came along.
<br>
<p>Now, someone might say that this is what PCs and the internet are so good
<br>
at:  they amplify our intelligence in such a way that a given inventor
<br>
really could become brighter, more productive, etc.  ...... but actually I
<br>
would still be on your side and argue against such a claim, because I think
<br>
the enhancement (or amplification) is fairly marginal.
<br>
<p>BUT, now imagine that I succeed in building the combination of hardware and
<br>
software that I call a &quot;Discovery Engine&quot;:  a machine that is smart enough
<br>
to understand the world by itself and invent new technology and make new
<br>
discoveries (call it an &quot;AI&quot; if you like:  I like to make a distinction
<br>
here, but that is not too important to the present point).
<br>
<p>If that discovery engine were to be built tomorrow, it would be &quot;used&quot; 
<br>
to build faster versions of itself, and those would be used to build faster
<br>
versions of themselves, and so on in the familiar pattern that is the core
<br>
thesis of the Singularity idea.  Within a short time, we would have systems
<br>
that produced new inventions at a rate that would be thousands or millions
<br>
of times faster than unaided human minds can achieve.
<br>
<p>A thousand times speedup would involve things like:  Einstein wakes up one
<br>
morning with no knowledge of physics, then he does some reading and
<br>
thinking, and by breakfast the next morning he has invented special and
<br>
general relativity.  Or, a million discovery engines start working together
<br>
on the problem of nanotechnology, and a year later they deliver a complete
<br>
system for re-engineering the human body to make it immune to disease and
<br>
effectively immortal.
<br>
<p>Now *that* is not business as usual.  For the first time, the technology
<br>
changes the generator of new technology.  Never happened before.  Not just
<br>
more of the same, but a whole new ball game.
<br>
<p>That is what the Singularity is all about, and why it makes no sense to say
<br>
that new technology is not such a big deal.
<br>
