I read the first 70 pages or so, prior to it's mention on this lis.  Decided 
<br>
it was a waste of time.
<br>
Acceleration skepticism is worth while, but this book was simply not well 
<br>
thought out, credible, or well written.
<br>
The Singularity is Near is full of poor reasoning, and clear thought would 
<br>
be served by a book of better reasoned skepticism and analysis, but such a 
<br>
book hasn't been published yet.  I keep track of the field well enough that 
<br>
I'd know.  The closest thing is the excellent &quot;Human Accomplishment: 800 BC 
<br>
to 1950 AD&quot;.
<br>
Phil Goetz could probably write an intellectually honest and competently 
<br>
argued version of &quot;Future Hype&quot; if he chose to, and it might contribute 
<br>
signficantly to the quality of low SL3 discussion.  I'm not at all convinced 
<br>
that well reasoned arguments can sell enough, or even attract enough 
<br>
attention from high status people, to make them worth the effort of writing.
<br>
<p>Anyway, none of this discussion is SL4.  Popular conceptions of the 
<br>
&quot;singularity&quot;, grounded on trend extrapolation for either poorly designed 
<br>
metrics like &quot;change&quot; or narrow metrics like &quot;transistors per dollar&quot; are 
<br>
squarely SL3 because they inspire a belief in discontinuous change without 
<br>
any real understanding of the reasons for discontinuous change or it's 
<br>
likely nature/dynamics.  At SL4 people don't believe in &quot;the singularity&quot; 
<br>
because they have extrapolated the past, but because they see in rough 
<br>
outline how it can be brought about.  They don't believe it will happen in 
<br>
2037 because that's when it's due, they believe that it will happen when 
<br>
someone makes it happen, if anyone ever does.  At SL4 &quot;the singularity&quot; 
<br>
isn't seen as a technological trend, like Moore's law or more powerful car 
<br>
engines, it's seen as a specific class of technology, like &quot;heavier than air 
<br>
flying machines&quot;.  We see how the laws of physics and information allow for 
<br>
such things, and how contemporary technology is sufficient to allow credible 
<br>
attempts, and how near future technologies, which are predicted 
<br>
substantially as the outcomes of trend projection (but trend projection 
<br>
stepping forward another decade or at most two decades on trends that have 
<br>
proven themselves for many decades) should make it slightly easier to make 
<br>
credible attempts to bring about singularity.
