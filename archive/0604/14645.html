</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Justin Corwin may have been right when he suggested that humans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are so incredibly inefficient, and chimpanzees so incredibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficient, that comparing the two provides no evidence whatsoever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the computational complexity of a well-designed intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Short term memory does not have 7 items in it.
<br>
<p>When cognitive scientists talk about the magic number 7 they are 
<br>
referring to the largest number of *unrelated* items that we seem 
<br>
capable of keeping in mind at one time.
<br>
<p>And the idea that the 7 limit is there because the brain is somehow 
<br>
having trouble keeping up with the task of making &quot;comparisons&quot; among 
<br>
the 7 items, a pretty simplistic approach to cognitive modelling.
