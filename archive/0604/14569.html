</em><br>
<p><p>That is a very European perspective of the market (not to be  
<br>
construed as a criticism of Europeans, just an observation having  
<br>
read quite a number of economics writings from current top European  
<br>
economic academics).  Much of that money may have been spent  
<br>
frivolously and stupidly, but it does not just disappear either.  In  
<br>
a market heavily chummed with capital and low transaction viscosity,  
<br>
an extraordinary amount of innovation happens feeding on the detritus  
<br>
of poor investments.  Whether or not investors lost hundreds of  
<br>
billions of dollars on stupid investments is almost immaterial to the  
<br>
argument here.  That frenzy created an ecology that allowed a  
<br>
plethora of good technologies to develop and survive by feeding on  
<br>
the capital chum even if they were not the direct targets of major  
<br>
investment.
<br>
<p>A bit of folk wisdom about the Silicon Valley business cycle (which  
<br>
is ~10 years long) is that a large percentage of the really solid and  
<br>
successful startups are formed during the bust rather than the boom.   
<br>
Those companies are light on direct capital investment, but are  
<br>
frequently so successful because they are scavengers that feed on the  
<br>
cornucopia of technology carcasses from the last bust, picking and  
<br>
choosing the bits they want from trash that no one is interested in  
<br>
-- a very powerful form of indirect capital investment that favors  
<br>
the smart and bold.  The carnage of the business cycle looks very  
<br>
bloody and is unappealing to many people because of that, but that  
<br>
death and decay feeds a lot of other less noticeable innovators that  
<br>
frequently are under even stronger evolutionary pressures.
<br>
<p>A nice orderly market with a boringly regular pace may seem more  
<br>
efficient, but in reality it tends to kill huge swaths of innovation  
<br>
ecology that need the carnage to survive.  A portion of that &quot;wasted&quot;  
<br>
capital ends up in the hands of innovators in various forms that  
<br>
would have been unlikely to get direct capital in any case.  With  
<br>
reference to my comment above, many European economists decry the  
<br>
wastefulness of the investment carnage that regularly occurs in  
<br>
places like Silicon Valley for most of the same reasons you cite, but  
<br>
fail to recognize that the &quot;waste&quot; itself is relative and a very  
<br>
important kind of investment that drives innovation and lowers  
<br>
barriers to entry for new ideas.
