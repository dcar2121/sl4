<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But is this really what you want, a world with magic genies that grant your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; every wish? Well, I guess so. Those are the goals that evolution programmed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; into your brain. They worked well enough to propagate your DNA in a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without AI. But surprisingly, it doesn't work when you can actually have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everything you want. If happiness means an increase in utility, then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reach a maximum because all real computers in this finite universe are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; finite state machines. In that maximum, any thought or perception would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unpleasant because it would result in a different mental state with lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; utility. Meanwhile, back in the real world, self replicating agents that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can't reprogram their goals will be evolving and competing for the resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; needed to run your dream world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>

Matt it is not allowable to make this analysis. This is meddling. It's like
<br>
saying to someone who wants to
<br>
fly &quot;yes you may want to fly, however, the air at higher altitudes is less
<br>
dense and you will suffocate...'
<br>
andsoforth. This person wants to emigrate into a new existential state. It's
<br>
a pilgrim father and you are
<br>
already setting yourself up to become a pogrom father. You can't accept it.
<br>
There must be a catch. This
<br>
cannot be. There must be a natural law. It can't be this easy. Quickly
<br>
quickly let's rationalize this into
<br>
impossibility because if it were possible it ..  it... would be
<br>
unacceptable!!!
<br>
<p>I suggest you wish him good luck and ask for progress reports. He might
<br>
discover amazing things
<br>
'down there'. My guess the eventual domain of dreamworld servers will be in
<br>
the tectonic plane bedrock
<br>
of planets. Lots of space there. Lots off energy there. Lots of minerals
<br>
there. He doesn't need to worry
<br>
all that much about jealous people who can't stand him having his little
<br>
cyber-amish dreamworld a
<br>
mile deep. He might last hundreds of years there. If he's lucky he'll
<br>
upgrade his wetbrain to a fresh
<br>
substrate and by the time he's ready he'll be running at thousand fold
<br>
cycles with a brain hundreds
<br>
of times as big, no longer himself bur rather a prismatic unfolded version
<br>
of self - a jungian, freudian
<br>
DM unto him/her/itself.  Or maybe a Dominatrix. Who is to tell?
<br>
<p>Maybe you can be his guest one day.
