<em>&gt; Matt it is not allowable to make this analysis. This is meddling. 
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say he couldn't do it. I believe that if people want to foolishly kill 
<br>
themselves, then they should have that right.
<br>
<p>I mean, this isn't hard. I have a program running a copy of your mind, an 
<br>
upload, if you will. It/you lives in a simulated paradise where all of your 
<br>
wishes are granted. Go ahead and shoot yourself to complete the upload. What's 
<br>
the matter? I have printouts to prove you are happy beyond your wildest dreams.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But is this really what you want, a world with magic genies that grant your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every wish? Well, I guess so. Those are the goals that evolution programmed into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your brain. They worked well enough to propagate your DNA in a world without AI. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But  surprisingly, it doesn't work when you can actually have everything you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;want. If happiness means an increase in utility, then you reach a maximum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because all real computers in this finite universe are finite state machines. In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that maximum, any thought or perception would be unpleasant because it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;result in a different mental state with lower utility. Meanwhile, back in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real world, self replicating agents that can't reprogram their goals will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolving and competing for the resources needed to run your dream world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Matt it is not allowable to make this analysis. This is meddling. It's like 
<br>
saying to someone who wants to
<br>
fly &quot;yes you may want to fly, however, the air at higher altitudes is less dense 
<br>
and you will suffocate...'
<br>
andsoforth. This person wants to emigrate into a new existential state. It's a 
<br>
pilgrim father and you are
<br>
already setting yourself up to become a pogrom father. You can't accept it. 
<br>
There must be a catch. This
<br>
cannot be. There must be a natural law. It can't be this easy. Quickly quickly 
<br>
let's rationalize this into
<br>
impossibility because if it were possible it ..  it... would be unacceptable!!!
<br>
<p>I suggest you wish him good luck and ask for progress reports. He might discover 
<br>
amazing things 
<br>
<p>'down there'. My guess the eventual domain of dreamworld servers will be in the 
<br>
tectonic plane bedrock
<br>
of planets. Lots of space there. Lots off energy there. Lots of minerals there. 
<br>
He doesn't need to worry 
<br>
<p>all that much about jealous people who can't stand him having his little 
<br>
cyber-amish dreamworld a 
<br>
<p>mile deep. He might last hundreds of years there. If he's lucky he'll upgrade 
<br>
his wetbrain to a fresh
<br>
substrate and by the time he's ready he'll be running at thousand fold cycles 
<br>
with a brain hundreds
<br>
of times as big, no longer himself bur rather a prismatic unfolded version of 
<br>
self - a jungian, freudian
<br>
DM unto him/her/itself.  Or maybe a Dominatrix. Who is to tell?
<br>
<p>Maybe you can be his guest one day.
