Well, again, I think you're being overly pessimistic here. From what I
<br>
<em>&gt; know of quantum computing, it works really really well for a narrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of problems (looking at Wikipedia's list of &quot;factoring, discrete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logarithm, and quantum physics simulations&quot; seems about right). Now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if Penrose is right, the third problem set would be useful, but I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see a great boost to AI programs being given by the first two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, to me it looks like AI is going to include great gobs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of classical AI and computing.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think (and this is where it gets really confusing) that since Penrose's
<br>
reasoning is that the godel incompleateness theorem means that the brain
<br>
must be capble of non algorithmic reasoning, the &quot;factoring, discrete
<br>
logarithm, and quantum physics simulations&quot;, being algorithmic, are not
<br>
sufficent, and his idear is that this non algorithmic thingy is when the
<br>
wave function collapses.
<br>
So if he is right, the brain is a long way from classical AI.
<br>
I need to go read more on this. But the good thing about this is that unlike
<br>
a lot of philosophy about the mind, this should at least be experimentally
<br>
verifiable.
<br>
<p>...It's humor, mon. You're supposed to laugh. Admittedly, it's fairly
<br>
<em>&gt; geeky and turn of the century humor, but still fairly normal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Do they want to be attacked? If not, it's a good argument against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; collective volition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps they really enjoy it. The point is that from our limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective it is hard to tell: I remember being a child and being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disgusted by the mere suggestion of kissing.
</em><br>
<p><p>I realise it's humor, but it's in the middle of somthing serious - and I'm
<br>
sure some of them would enjoy it, but I think the odds are against every
<br>
single Japanese schoolgirl wanting to be attacked.
<br>
<p>Oh, and if the world does end up getting turned into a hentai anime, if it's
<br>
ok with everyone could I be a purple-haired lesbian with some kinda
<br>
superpowers? (and I am serious)
<br>
<p>I'm not following how game theory would help here. If anything, I'd
<br>
<em>&gt; think that multiple uploads would be even worse - the pressures for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preemptive strikes/defections would be overpowering: suppose one were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an upload and decided to go slow since there is no need to rush to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the capabilities to take out all the other uploads. Isn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious that such a strategy would play right into the hands of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few bad apples, who could so rush and then obliterate the others? So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the Friendly ones would be forced to rush into transcendence or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever just to thwart the possible unFriendly ones. And if two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managed to acheive the same levels before they turned on each other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the side effects could range anywhere from unnoticeable to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existential risk.
</em><br>
<p><p>I was having a conversation elsewhere with somone who argued that uploads
<br>
would lead to an arms race which would eventually consume the entire
<br>
universe and lead to a vastly accelerated heat-death of the univerce
<br>
(assuming that no way is found to reverse entropy).
<br>
This is likely if there was no strong stable treaty/govenment which would
<br>
prevent conflict/arms races. Multiple uploads would be nessary for this
<br>
stability: with two uploads all your arguments above are valid, whereas with
<br>
1000 uploads a premptive strike may or may not be enough to defeat all 999
<br>
other uploads. As we don't know what form posthuman warfare would take it's
<br>
hard to know how effective a premptive strike would be, and thus how many
<br>
uploads are nessasary for game theory to guarente stability.
<br>
<p>I suppose the question is which is more practical: a stable government of
<br>
posthumans or FAI.
<br>
<p>This largly revolves round which techs come first. I think uploads might
<br>
come before FAI, but with the computing power for uploads it should be
<br>
possible to brute force UFAI. And somone probbly will. DNI could come long
<br>
before any of the above.
<br>
<p><p>Finally, does everyone here agree with collective volition as oppsed to
<br>
individual volition?
