This is about inventors, &quot;crackpot inventors&quot; and inventions.  It has little
<br>
to do with recent events on the mailing list, except perhaps by abstraction.

</em><br>
<p>Well, the archetypal case of an Australian automotive invention getting
<br>
through several testing layers, only to flop, is the Orbital Engine.  Ford
<br>
etc sunk well over $50 million into it, only to show that it was ahead of
<br>
what was available in 1972, but by 1980s, was obsolete.
<br>
<p>Ralph Sarich, its inventor is, however, definitely NOT a &quot;crackpot&quot; in the
<br>
relevant sense.  Aggressive, cunning, highly driven... he's not a &quot;normal
<br>
guy&quot;, but he's very well qualified as an Engineer.  Opinion on him
<br>
personally is still reasonably contentious.
<br>
<p>Despite the losses on the testing, and huge accompanied paper losses,
<br>
Orbital Engine Company is still around, and has a strong reputation.
<br>
<p>Similar but different is Arthur E Bishop, who, although thoroughly
<br>
qualified, is a true tinkerer.  He designed the variable ratio rack &amp; peanut
<br>
steering system that was on something like 25% of cars worldwide at one
<br>
stage.  <a href="http://www.aebishop.com/steer_tec_rack.htm">http://www.aebishop.com/steer_tec_rack.htm</a>
<br>
Bishop Steering went through some rough patches early on (well before my
<br>
time).   Arthur is now going around promoting this monorail
<br>
system&lt;<a href="http://www.austrans.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=99&amp;Itemid=113">http://www.austrans.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=99&amp;Itemid=113</a>ýØ/ý<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Actual crackpots:  There was a guy from Sydney a short while back with an
<br>
idea for a crankshaft with a kink in it /articulation thingy.  He had some
<br>
very convincing calculations and software models- enough to impress a number
<br>
of   CSIRO &lt;http:///&gt; engineers, and enough for them to get him
<br>
a 3-way appointment with BMW... at the appointment, he was so defensive
<br>
about his invention (&quot;the problem with the old system&quot;) and so insulting to
<br>
the OEMs (&quot;the problem with you manufacturers&quot;) that the BMW engineers said
<br>
&quot;stuff it - can't be arsed&quot;.  The iconic crackpot element is that he was so
<br>
defensive about all this stuff, despite sending unsolicited details to the
<br>
CSIRO...
<br>
<p>There was a group who had some ideas about getting high power, high octane
<br>
fuel derived from gum leaves a while back.  All theoretically sound.  They
<br>
approached Ford, who kept saying &quot;show us&quot;... they would come back with a
<br>
different rig that demonstrated /an aspect/ of the theory...
<br>
<p>There was something about valve lifters and performance enhancement a few
<br>
years ago, but I can't remember the details...
<br>
<p>Then there was a recent debacle, with which I had direct contact.  A
<br>
tinkerer, totally unqualified, came up with a theory about heated fuel
<br>
injection.  He developed an aftermarket modification that allegedly improved
<br>
fuel economy.  Drive cycle tests indicated that there might be something to
<br>
it.  He was able to get funding from various channels and even had
<br>
Australia's top automotive-accessories retailer onboard.  The inventor
<br>
decided that it would be better to shun the industry-standardised testing,
<br>
and instead went for on-road testing.  Altohugh he managed to get
<br>
testimonials that certain drivers had experienced a 20% fuel-economy
<br>
benefit, such testimonials are worthless to the industry.  *(I think there
<br>
are /just/ enough people out there who understand that the plural of
<br>
anecdote is &quot;anecdotes&quot;, to keep everything from falling apart).* Anyway,
<br>
that company has gone belly-under, and I hear that one of the investors is
<br>
now trying to get the rights to pursue the testing regime that I had
<br>
proposed to them at least two years ago...

<em>&gt; I admit that I'm skeptical of this assertion.  If crazy people - not
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the so-called &quot;sane&quot; people are doing something wrong and probably
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have oft seen gold mistaken for copper, and read of such cases in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books; but I have yet to see a flower grow from genuine gravel.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying you /need/ crazies to come up with good ideas.  I'm saying
<br>
that crazies can make worthwhile contributions.
<br>
<p>Analogy:  A similar principle was recently mentioned on Extropy-Chat: that
<br>
autism-spectrum types have strong leanings towards the sciences.
<br>
<p>Is it the case that the sciences are full of autistic people?  Not from my
<br>
experience.  Probably a higher percentage than in other fields.  But it is
<br>
true that whilst autism-y tendencies can have huge disadvantages in some
<br>
areas, they aren't a problem in others.  Such leanings may make it easier to
<br>
deal with pertinent scientific issues, so there may be some sciency
<br>
advantages.
<br>
<p>Likewise with tinkerers- there seems to be a &quot;syndrome&quot; that could
<br>
potentially have physical causes that leads some kids to have a strong
<br>
predisposition to take apart toasters, microwaves, cars, etc.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;All of the people I've discussed in this post are perfectly lucid.  They
<br>
are all entirely &quot;sane&quot;.  But, in speaking to them, they each appear
<br>
distinctly &quot;abnormal&quot;.  The tinkerers have a /systematic/ abnormality.
<br>
Their deviation from the human norm _is all about_ seeing the world in a
<br>
different way.
<br>
<p>If people-who-see-the-world-differently are clever and lucky, their
<br>
&quot;different view of the world&quot; will allow them to create/do something that
<br>
can demonstrate their ideas.   If they're left trying to describe their
<br>
viewpoint, they're in trouble, because for &quot;success&quot;, they have to convey
<br>
their different view in a way that is palatable to the normal view,
<br>
which is rather awkward.
<br>
<p>When somebody tries to describe how they see the world differently, the
<br>
natural low-success rate can lead to  frustration.  Frustration leads to
<br>
habitual anger and hang-ups, and underlying anger associated with an issue
<br>
can lead to a decrease in communication quality.
<br>
<p>How is this an issue?
<br>
<p>One of the areas that attracts inventive attention is
<br>
turbine-design/efficiency.  Some of the &quot;solutions&quot; are perpetual motion
<br>
machines (PMM), but some things that look like PMMs are really just clever
<br>
designs.
<br>
<p>Take a look at Energetech's reversing turbine design.  (main site: www.*
<br>
energetech*.com.au/ seems to be down) When I first saw it, I immediately
<br>
thought &quot;warning! Free Energy!&quot; but it's _not_ a PMM.  I can imagine that
<br>
many people would have blocked their ears before the prototype was built...
