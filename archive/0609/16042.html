<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ratio of speed to memory for digital computers is much slower than for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a human brain (which it is at present, and always has been). Therefore early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploads have much slower thought processes than humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An upload requires somewhere from a roomful to a buildingful of computers;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can't run over a wide area cluster, the bandwidth is far too slow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore it's sessile and highly dependent on the biological humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintaining the equipment; it can't so much as sneeze without permission.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Wouldn't this apply equally to AIs?
<br>
<p>Uploads don't gain intelligence at a substantial rate, other than the way
<br>
<em>&gt; biological humans do, because in addition to the enormous difficulty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gaining intelligence in general, the human brain even digitized contains no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; user serviceable parts.
</em><br>
<p><p>The brain shows an ability to repair itself and grow, an upload should also
<br>
be able to.
<br>
<p>Uploads don't gain intelligence at all, other than the way biological humans
<br>
<em>&gt; do; they're legally forbidden write access to their substrate in the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way humans are forbidden mind-altering drugs (and unlike drugs, upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware isn't a vest pocket commodity).
</em><br>
<p><p>I would think it more  likely that uploads are either illegal  or  not
<br>
recognised by the law as alive.
<br>
<p>I'm not proposing to argue about whether the above _will_ happen, since the
<br>
<em>&gt; technology still doesn't exist outside our imaginations, so it's really just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a case of which stories one finds more plausible. I am simply pointing out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is no evidence for the &quot;upload to ascension&quot; idea, and indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history shows that new technologies always have limitations and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disadvantages that prevent them from being as dominant as their more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimistic advocates had hoped.
</em><br>
<p><p>Fair enough, but there are many technologies that are more dominant then
<br>
people thought as well.
<br>
<p><p>It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to
<br>
achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such
<br>
statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years.
<br>
