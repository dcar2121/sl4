I took a few minutes to google Richard
<br>
Loosemore's credentials, as best I could. He
<br>
spoke at the AGIRI Workshop this May, and was
<br>
Director of Research at an outfit called
<br>
Starbridge Systems. Now, for all I can tell from
<br>
over here, the Workshop was an open mic session,
<br>
and Starbridge Systems only had three employees
<br>
(look at me, I was once Production Manager at
<br>
Woods Hole Weekly, but when the staff will all
<br>
fit in an elevator, you can give yourselves
<br>
titles like General, Baron, and Lord High  if you
<br>
please). Point is, though, I have never read
<br>
Judgement Under Uncertainty, though I suppose I
<br>
ought, and if Loosemore is a BS artist, he's a BS
<br>
artist with some working papers and at a level
<br>
above my expertise in this field. In most matters
<br>
my personal BS detector is about state of the
<br>
art, but in SL4 it is at its redline most of the
<br>
time. I accept this.
<br>
<p>While I'm agnostic about whether Loosemore lied
<br>
or exaggerated concerning his cog sci
<br>
credentials, I will mention the obvious fact that
<br>
careers and reputations in science have been
<br>
destroyed by getting caught in a lie, and that is
<br>
as it should be. If anything, it should happen
<br>
more, and in more fields. If politicians,
<br>
lawyers, CEO's and priests all had to go about
<br>
their business with wireless polygraph equipment
<br>
on their clothing at all times, in constant fear
<br>
of becoming unemployable known liars, there'd be
<br>
far less 'evil' in the world. If we can strip a
<br>
bicyclist of his medal for failing urine tests,
<br>
how can we countenance the incredibly suicidal
<br>
practice of letting detectable liars make
<br>
decisions about life, death, war and extinction?
<br>
<p>In this matter I give Eliezer the benefit of
<br>
every doubt, because when I do understand him, I
<br>
find his reasoning elegant enough to remind me of
<br>
Pythagoras. Of all the brilliant AI researchers
<br>
who might have conceived the urgent primacy of
<br>
Friendliness as a core principle rather than an
<br>
add-on, it was Eliezer Yudkowsky who actually
<br>
thought of it. If that was the only good idea
<br>
Eliezer ever had, it would still put him ahead of
<br>
such shining intellects as Bill Joy, whose
<br>
thinking runs a bit like this: &quot;The future
<br>
doesn't need us; oh, bother, we're all screwed! I
<br>
think I'll build a fifty million dollar yacht.&quot;
