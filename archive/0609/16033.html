Welcome to posting, Norman.
<br>
<p>I can't speak on behalf of the Institute, but there is a fair bit of info
<br>
that they've put out - it's just not all obvious how to access it.  Their
<br>
current approach seems to be something like: mostly theory, then some
<br>
community advocacy, then more theory, then some practical stuff.
<br>
<p>Michael Wilson seems to be chief instigator of practical stuff, but sure as
<br>
hell don't quote me on that.
<br>
<p>Also, from my experience, talking about flying saucers /per se/ won't get
<br>
you banned.  If it should happen that some UFOs etc are related to
<br>
extraterrestrials, that could be relevant to the singularity.  However, keep
<br>
in mind that this is a scientifically minded community, with some hard-core
<br>
sceptics.  Therefore, any statements relevant to flying saucers must adhere
<br>
to scientific and sceptical concerns.
<br>
<p>For instance, if someone makes a comment about the irrelevance of SETI
<br>
because any old civilisation &quot;would&quot; do X, it would be reasonable to
<br>
introduce competing hypotheses that extraterrestrials may chose to interract
<br>
in different ways, eg: via flying saucer observation, and that there may be
<br>
reason to believe in a non-zero probability of some UFO experiences
<br>
supporting such hypotheses.
<br>
<p>I'm not too fussed.  I believe that anyone who says they don't believe in
<br>
UFOs needs to re-check the definition.  I sure as hell don't assign a
<br>
significant probability to the hypothesis that UFOs are related to
<br>
extraterrestrial activities.
<br>
<p>Belief in the ability of teacups and saucers to fly if you suspend them on a
<br>
moving airstream, although hardly SL4-relevant, would not likely be an
<br>
issue, either.
<br>
<p>Cheers
