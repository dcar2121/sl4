<em>&gt; Hey everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I hear that there is turmoil in this list recinatly with people getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kicked off for critisizing FAI. Which makes this an interesting time for me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to join especially as I think FAI might be a bad way to approach things, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the following reasons (I realise they have probably been raised before):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1) I think Roger Penrose's idear that the mind relys somehow on quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects could be correct, and if they are this makes an AI on a classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer impractical.
</em><br>
<p>Well, so what? If consciousness is purely impossible without quantum
<br>
effects, and consciousness really is the simplest way of producing all
<br>
the observable consequences we attribute to intelligence and
<br>
consciousness, then we can simply make a quantum computer. Progress is
<br>
steady and sure in that domain these days anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  2) Assuming AI on a classical computer is possible, do you actually know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what ethics to give the AI? Utilitarianism would end with humanity being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turned to computronium, not in the sence of being uploaded but in the sence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of being replaced with somthing happier.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's act utilitarianism you're thinking of there, not rule or
<br>
any of the more exotic variants. Eliezer's latest thinking is
<br>
apparently on the lines of his
<br>
<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/friendly/extrapolated-volition.html">http://www.intelligence.org/friendly/extrapolated-volition.html</a> essay;
<br>
it's worth reading.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  3) Assuming you have the ethical theory sorted, it seems to me (not that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know much about this) that programming seed AI might be quite easy with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brute force, but programming FAI is increadbly hard.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah. That's one of SIAI's arguments for funding them instead of
<br>
regular seed AI projects - better to get FAI first and then regular AI
<br>
can come later when FAI presumably will be able to ameliorate the
<br>
effects of a rogue seed AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  4) Even if FAI is the best idear, why singinst and not univercity AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaserch?
</em><br>
<p>See above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Instead, I think brain-computer interfacing might be a better idear. AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts should not give the AI direct control over anything, and the AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be asked how to bootstrap humans. A big off button would also be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good idear.
</em><br>
<p>Your second line is a suggestion for AI boxing. See
<br>
<a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0207/4935.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0207/4935.html</a> and <a href="http://sl4.org/wiki/AI_Jail">http://sl4.org/wiki/AI_Jail</a>
<br>
Long story short, not giving the AI direct control over anything would
<br>
probably only work in the early stages and so would be of minimal use.
<br>
Ditto for the big off button.
<br>
Uploading brains doesn't seem to be a popular suggestion on this list
<br>
either, since their reasoning goes that humans are not the stablest
<br>
and sanest mentalities you can get, and would probably become
<br>
unfriendly in an upload.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I could say more about myself, but I might as well do the questionaire
</em><br>
