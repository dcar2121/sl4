<em>&gt; Also, from my experience, talking about flying saucers /per se/ won't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you banned.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, good... in that case, I'll take this opportunity to point out a
<br>
study my father did years ago,
<br>
<p><a href="http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/UFO.htm">http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/UFO.htm</a>
<br>
<p>in which it is found that people who claim to have been abducted by
<br>
UFO's also have statistically uncommon likelihood of claiming to have
<br>
seen ghosts, to have had out-of-body experiences, etc.
<br>
<p>Of course, this doesn't PROVE that UFO abduction is a psychological
<br>
delusion ... after all, it could be that the aliens particularly enjoy
<br>
abducting hallucination-prone people, so as to give themselves a more
<br>
effective cover story ;-)
<br>
<p>The most amusing thing about this study was that it got my dad's
<br>
picture in the National Enquirer once, with the headline &quot;TOP
<br>
UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS REVEAL 8 MILLION AMERICANS MAY HAVE BEEN
<br>
ABDUCTED BY UFO'S&quot; ... a misleading but not false headline.  He was
<br>
pleased to be called a top research professor, though the National
<br>
Enquirer is not the most reputable source for such claims.  But the
<br>
Enquirer article itself completely ignored the main finding of their
<br>
research, just focusing on the fact that a lot of people reported UFO
<br>
abduction.  Basically the Enquirer article represented the research as
<br>
saying exactly the opposite of what it did.
<br>
<p>I do find it fascinating the degree to which various people who claim
<br>
UFO abduction fairly consistently claim to see aliens with the same
<br>
shape of head, and other common characteristics.  But this is not so
<br>
different from the tendency of everyone who takes hallucinogenic drugs
<br>
to see the same sorts of visual patterns -- such as spirals, tunnels,
<br>
etc.
<br>
