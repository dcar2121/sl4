<p>
I'm in the middle of reading &quot;Guns, Germs &amp; Steel&quot;, and thought it
<br>
might be worth pointing out a theory the author uses to postulate a
<br>
higher-than-average IQ amongst New Guineans than amongst the general
<br>
western population, even though they are seen as some of the most
<br>
primitive peoples alive today in terms of economic development.
<br>
<p>Essentially the #1 cause of death in pre-colonial New Guinea was
<br>
murder. Murder, unlike disease, is a directed and specifically
<br>
targeted act that can, with some difficulty, be avoided. I guess the
<br>
theory goes that the smarter you are the more likely you are going to
<br>
either a) flee b) engage in pre-conflict diplomacy c) be more valuable
<br>
to potential murderers alive than dead d) redirect existential
<br>
murderous urges elsewhere.
<br>
<p>Basic summation: the smarter you are the more likely you are to be
<br>
avoid murder; therefore the higher the rate of murder in a given
<br>
population the higher ongoing natural selection of smarter people.
<br>
(the Bayes experts here can pull this apart as they see fit)
<br>
<p>And I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that given the rather
<br>
long historical (and current) prevalence of anti-semitism and directed
<br>
acts of murder against Jews (of which Ashkenazim constitute 80%,
<br>
according to Wikipedia; to me this makes the two concepts seemingly
<br>
interchangable, and when not, seemingly a bit disparaging to the
<br>
Sephardic) this may well have alot to do with any genetic factor that
<br>
contributes to their undoubted record of achievement (and hotness!
<br>
Jamie Lee Curtis... dayam).
<br>
<p>But it's worth pointing out both to the fanboys and naysayers that you
<br>
wouldn't wish for the kind of natural selection the Ashkenazi Jews
<br>
have experienced.
<br>
<p>And I guess to the Ashkemazim on the list I'd offer a sincere apology
<br>
on behalf of my fellow of-non-hebrew-decent fellows past-and-present;
<br>
the ongoing prevalance of anti-semitism in various cultures is a
<br>
disgusting and seemingly inexplicable stain upon said groups.
<br>
<p>I'd also like to offer thanks for the ongoing invaluable contributions
<br>
and for not holing up in your shells like the Amish :-)
