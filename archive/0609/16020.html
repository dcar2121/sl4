[various things snipped and agreed with]

<p>I'm not following how game theory would help here. If anything, I'd
<br>
<em>&gt; think that multiple uploads would be even worse - the pressures for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preemptive strikes/defections would be overpowering: suppose one were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an upload and decided to go slow since there is no need to rush to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the capabilities to take out all the other uploads. Isn't it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious that such a strategy would play right into the hands of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few bad apples, who could so rush and then obliterate the others? So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the Friendly ones would be forced to rush into transcendence or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever just to thwart the possible unFriendly ones.
</em><br>
<p><p>It's worth bearing in mind that the idea of uploads having or quickly
<br>
acquiring vast power isn't based on evidence, only on our own psychology;
<br>
our Cro-Magnon brains are programmed to jump up and down at the hint of
<br>
special powers for person A relative to person B - this includes me of
<br>
course, I think it's a cool idea. But consider the following scenarios:
<br>
<p>The ratio of speed to memory for digital computers is much slower than for a
<br>
human brain (which it is at present, and always has been). Therefore early
<br>
uploads have much slower thought processes than humans.
<br>
<p>An upload requires somewhere from a roomful to a buildingful of computers;
<br>
it can't run over a wide area cluster, the bandwidth is far too slow.
<br>
Therefore it's sessile and highly dependent on the biological humans
<br>
maintaining the equipment; it can't so much as sneeze without permission.
<br>
<p>Uploads don't gain intelligence at a substantial rate, other than the way
<br>
biological humans do, because in addition to the enormous difficulty of
<br>
gaining intelligence in general, the human brain even digitized contains no
<br>
user serviceable parts.
<br>
<p>Uploads don't gain intelligence at all, other than the way biological humans
<br>
do; they're legally forbidden write access to their substrate in the same
<br>
way humans are forbidden mind-altering drugs (and unlike drugs, upload
<br>
hardware isn't a vest pocket commodity).
<br>
<p>I'm not proposing to argue about whether the above _will_ happen, since the
<br>
technology still doesn't exist outside our imaginations, so it's really just
<br>
a case of which stories one finds more plausible. I am simply pointing out
<br>
that there is no evidence for the &quot;upload to ascension&quot; idea, and indeed
<br>
history shows that new technologies always have limitations and
<br>
disadvantages that prevent them from being as dominant as their more
<br>
optimistic advocates had hoped.
