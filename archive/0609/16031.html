A very good point.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>However, Friendly AI, probably should not (have to) figure out what people
<br>
want, but perhaps to only help create an environment to will allow people to
<br>
flourish. Having said that, I have strong reservation about the possibility
<br>
of Friendly AI (some old notes:

Subject: Questions/Problems regarding CEV
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>A fourth, and major, source of spread:
<br>
<p>If you ask people what they want, they'll tell you, but they give totally
<br>
different answers depending on how they're asked. This is not because they
<br>
don't know their own minds, but because they're making it up as they go
<br>
along. Their desires are real; they're just generated in response to the
<br>
question. CEV does not define how people would be asked, and there is no
<br>
easy solution to this. To figure out how people would want to be asked, you
<br>
have to ask them how they'd want to be asked, etc. 
<br>
<p>Secretly probing their brains doesn't work either, because the information
<br>
simply isn't there. You can determine that they want sex, they want a raise,
<br>
they want to go home, and they want a cookie, but to try to extrapolate
<br>
these desires into a universal optimization process is insanity. It's like
<br>
interpreting a kindergarten scribble as the blueprint for a house. The only
<br>
way to get the necessary level of detail from the kindergartner is to ask
<br>
them to invent it, and what they invent depends on how you ask them. 
<br>
<p>There are innumerable other details of the extrapolation which are
<br>
undefined, and the resulting dynamic hinges on their definition. Do you plan
<br>
to define them? If so, how, and what outcome are you trying to achieve? If
<br>
not, how do you expect a scribble of a procedure to extrapolate a scribble
<br>
of human desires into anything approaching a coherent plan? 
<br>
<p>My strong suspicion is that you do plan to define them, and to define them
<br>
such as to aim for a specific target, but that you are making that target up
<br>
as you go along, as you are operating from a scribble yourself. 
<br>
<p><p>(I've donated $800 some dollars, so theoretically I'm allowed to talk about
<br>
this.)
