<p>A more useful comment/response: the fact that what you just said
<br>
sounds easier to you than &quot;the AI should be nice to people&quot; is *an
<br>
illusion*.  It's an artifact of your having a very complex brain
<br>
optimized for certain social interactions; you imagine that all
<br>
other minds will have similar complexity.
<br>
<p>An example/exercise:
<br>
<p>Try to seriously think about *EVERYTHING* you need to know to go
<br>
from &quot;I need to get this piano out of my second story apartment, and
<br>
I don't care what happens to it&quot; to &quot;I should look down carefully
<br>
before I throw the thing out the window&quot;.
<br>
<p>Some of these things:
<br>
<p>* humans are fragile and hard to repair
<br>
** what &quot;repair&quot; means
<br>
** why a human would want to repair injury
<br>
** why other humans would want to repair injury to an innocent injured bystander
<br>
** what &quot;innocent&quot; means: why certain injuries are morally justified and others aren't
<br>
* humans care about being hurt
<br>
** what &quot;caring&quot; means
<br>
** understanding that others have values that might need to be respected
<br>
** why humans care about being hurt: what pain means, what death means
<br>
* a falling piano will do severe damage to a human
<br>
** what &quot;falling&quot; means
<br>
** how gravity works
<br>
** how mass and speed interact to create force
<br>
* humans are likely to be in the street below, and even if it isn't likely the risk of severe injury mandates that I check
<br>
<p>There are many, many more; that's off the top of my head.
<br>
<p>If you dry to drill to first principles on *every* aspect of that,
<br>
it's a staggering amount of information.
<br>
<p>And not just information, *knowledge*.  And wisdom, really.
<br>
<p>Because not only do you need to know all these things, they all need
<br>
to connect to each other.  &quot;I need to get rid of this piano&quot; needs
<br>
to lead to &quot;this apartment has a window&quot; to &quot;I can throw things out
<br>
of the window&quot; to &quot;I wonder if anyone's down there?&quot; to &quot;this might
<br>
hurt somebody, I'd better check&quot;.
<br>
<p>This is a *STAGGERING* amount of knowledge and wisdom.  Now multiply
<br>
that by everything that has to be understood to *obey any possible
<br>
command*, let alone obey even a significant fraction of any
<br>
significant legal code.
<br>
<p>If it can maintain all of that through recursive self improvement,
<br>
the AI is so wise you might as well just say &quot;be nice to humans&quot; and
<br>
call it good; you've already done all the hard work.
