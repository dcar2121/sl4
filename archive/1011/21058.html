<p>
Max Tegmark's theory (&quot;All structures that exist mathematically exist also
<br>
physically&quot;) is summarized at:
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Level_IV:_Ultimate_Ensemble">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Level_IV:_Ultimate_Ensemble</a>
<br>
<p>I have my reasons for thinking its true, but since many of you already think
<br>
Tegmark is right, and since it would be too long to explain why I think it,
<br>
everything I write below will assume it. That will be the only assumption.
<br>
<p>If that theory is true (which the rest of this writing will assume), then the
<br>
universe equals Chaitin's Constant, equals all of math, and has a Kolmogorov
<br>
Complexity of 0. The Kolmogorov Complexity of nothing (nonexistance) is also 0.
<br>
The universe simultaneously equals everything and nothing. Because nothing is
<br>
subset of of every other subset (in an analog way), the universe is a subset of
<br>
every part of itself, therefore the universe is a fractal. Its also a fractal in
<br>
the way that a Turing Machine can emulate an other Turing Machine to any depth.
<br>
<p>An other way to say that is a multiverse of Turing Machines where each bit is
<br>
viewed as a sphere which changes depending on other spheres in the ways
<br>
described by quantum physics. Each quantum particle/wave/etc or combinations of
<br>
them are such a sphere. There can be deep indirect connections between any 2
<br>
bits, as we know from how software normally works.
<br>
<p>There are many Chaitin's Constants, but I mean the kind for programs up to
<br>
infinity bits. The way I'm using it, the specific language of those bits will be
<br>
left as an abstraction. Because of the unsolvability of the halting-problem,
<br>
Chaitin's Constant is uncomputable. Multiverse branching happens because
<br>
Chaitin's Constant is uncomputable. It can't choose so it does both.
<br>
<p>Because the universe is symmetric in every way (Kolmogorov Complexity 0), and
<br>
what we call reality is mostly not symmetric, what we call reality must be a
<br>
subset of something that is symmetric which could be combined with other subsets
<br>
to total a symmetric whole.
<br>
<p>Because Kolmogorov Complexity 0 is the only property of the universe, there has
<br>
to be something about it that results in nonsymmetric parts being self aware
<br>
individually. The way Turing Machines work, many parts of the data have little
<br>
or no interaction with other data, so if such data calculated a mind, it might
<br>
think it is an individual and think its subset of the data is how the whole
<br>
Turing Machine works. Everywhere that data is copied or interacts with other
<br>
data in the Turing Machine, the statistical patterns it observed tend to be
<br>
accurate. It calls them &quot;laws of physics&quot;.
<br>
<p>Its not just 1 Turing Machine. Its an infinite multiverse of Turing Machines,
<br>
together forming some view of Chaitin's Constant. That smoothes the statistical
<br>
patterns. Data can flow between them and be in many at the same time.
<br>
<p>It doesn't fit exactly, but the Buddhists describe the universe similarly,
<br>
called Indra's Net:
<br>
&quot;Imagine a multidimensional spider's web in the early morning covered with dew
<br>
drops. And every dew drop contains the reflection of all the other dew drops.
<br>
And, in each reflected dew drop, the reflections of all the other dew drops in
<br>
that reflection. And so ad infinitum. That is the Buddhist conception of the
<br>
universe in an image.&quot; --Alan Watts
<br>
<p>I've described the universe in a few ways. Now I'll explain how to use those
<br>
statistical patterns.
<br>
<p>We know there are statistical patterns at least as complex as life forming from
<br>
quantum particles, because thats what happens here. The laws of physics are also
<br>
patterns. Space, time, mass, and energy are patterns that physics statistically
<br>
controls. Remember that we're assuming the universe equals all of math
<br>
(Kolmogorov Complexity 0) so that requires all such patterns be made of the same
<br>
stuff and have a peer-to-peer relationship instead of x created y created z.
<br>
Statistically x can appear to create y, but there can be no absolute law in the
<br>
universe that says it has to always happen that way. The only absolute law
<br>
(which we are assuming in this text) is the Kolmogorov Complexity of the
<br>
universe is 0 (universe equals all of math). If there was an other absolute law,
<br>
then the Kolmogorov Complexity would have to be higher to define it.
<br>
<p>Quantum physics is a branch of statistics and some of its equations appear to be
<br>
closely related to bayesian networks, but I'm not an expert. If that is true or
<br>
not, bayesian networks are still a powerful statistics tool that scales up to
<br>
any number of statistical events you can store in the computer. It finds the
<br>
chances of any set of events when given the chances of other events. If no other
<br>
information is available about those events, then a bayesian network, when run
<br>
enough cycles to find a good network shape, always approaches the correct answer
<br>
with an accuracy higher than Humans can think. Humans normally win at such
<br>
statistics tests only because they do not put all the relevant information into
<br>
the bayesian network, because they have so many subconscious thoughts that they
<br>
do not know how to put into the computer. For pure math things like quantum
<br>
physics, bayesian networks, combined with various ways of inputting and
<br>
outputting the timing and context of events, will find many statistical
<br>
patterns.
<br>
<p>Quantum physics research has focused too much on small size and short times. It
<br>
should be expanded to look for large statistical patterns that are the effects
<br>
of such small events.
<br>
<p>Since the universe is a multiverse of an infinite number of Turing Machines and
<br>
quantum physics is the sphere view of those bits, we can use the statistical
<br>
properties of Turing Machines in to predict physics.
<br>
<p>Usually Turing Machines generate mostly random appearing data but theres also
<br>
some weak patterns in it that can be detected by a Bayesian Network applied to
<br>
those bits.
<br>
<p>Whatever patterns occur in the bits of those infinite number of Turing Machines
<br>
(the universe) are the only patterns in the universe, therefore physics and all
<br>
events are made of such patterns.
<br>
<p>Such patterns occur in statistical clustering ways. If that was not true, what
<br>
we call reality would fly apart instantly.
<br>
<p>The patterns in our brains are mostly built on top of the patterns called
<br>
physics, but statistical clustering of the other patterns will form between
<br>
people who tend to think the same things, and statistical clustering will happen
<br>
between people who drive on the same road often, and the same for all other
<br>
patterns. They all tend to stick together, like gravity for patterns. I don't
<br>
know enough physics to say if normal gravity is such statistical clustering or
<br>
if it is a pattern built on top of it at some depth.
<br>
<p>In the context of an infinite multiverse of Turing Machines, splitting off a
<br>
variation of the multiverse to do calculations is trivial. It happens in every
<br>
quantum physics experiment. The hard part is getting them to get far enough
<br>
apart that they don't statistically cluster back together (collapse the
<br>
wavefunction). When I say statistical clustering of patterns, I mean it in a
<br>
fuzzy way, so there are continuous paths between collapsing a wavefunction and
<br>
being a separate multiverse. Together, all such things total to a symmetric
<br>
universe, a Kolmogorov Complexity of 0.
<br>
<p>Up to now, this has been very theoretical, but it logically follows from Max
<br>
Tegmark's theory (&quot;All structures that exist mathematically exist also
<br>
physically&quot;) if its true. Here's an example to support the &quot;gravity for
<br>
patterns&quot; theory. Its a video I recorded in 2002 after practicing mental
<br>
experiments for 5 months. I can't do this any time I want to, and not nearly
<br>
this much any more, but the important thing is this is a result of patterns in
<br>
my brain. I thought it to make it happen:
<br>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ww8rI0BG9k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ww8rI0BG9k</a> There have always been people who had
<br>
strange mental abilities. Some were called witches and burned at the stake. Some
<br>
made it up. If the Kolmogorov Complexity of the universe is 0, then such mental
<br>
abilities are caused by statistical clustering of patterns at the same level
<br>
where the laws of physics formed as patterns. Its not magic. Its just something
<br>
thats hard to access and hard to learn.
<br>
<p>Brains learn those quantum patterns and adjust their thinking a little as if
<br>
communication through neurons and axons and through those patterns was a normal
<br>
part of the brain. You can disagree on the amount that will happen, but it
<br>
logically follows from the universe being math that it would happen some amount.
<br>
Empirically (as you can see in the video), it happens a measurable amount.
<br>
<p>I've explained why telepathy and other unusual mental abilities should be
<br>
expected if the universe equals math. My personal experience with it is not
<br>
needed to understand that, but it will help some people understand physics
<br>
better.
<br>
<p>One of my long-term plans is to build a software that uses subtle psychology in
<br>
its audio, video, and mouse movement interactions with each user, to
<br>
statistically synchronize the subconscious minds of many people through the
<br>
internet. It will detect very small patterns in their psychology (like the
<br>
physics patterns in brains described above), consider previous interactions with
<br>
that person and how the patterns synchronized with other people's patterns
<br>
across the internet, and adjust the subtle psychology (accessed through mouse,
<br>
audio, video, etc) instantly (many times per second) to statistically cause many
<br>
peoples' thought patterns to flow together. For example, if it changes some
<br>
realtime music (like in Audivolv) on 2 peoples' computers and causes both of
<br>
them to move their mouse in the same directions at the same times, without those
<br>
people knowing why they move their mouse that way, then the thoughts are
<br>
synchronized some. That's not enough. When its working, disconnect the internet
<br>
communications between the 2 softwares, and see how long those 2 people continue
<br>
moving their mouse the same as each other (by reconnecting and comparing data
<br>
after the experiment). It can be done faster by simply keeping those 2 software
<br>
processes separate instead of disconnecting the internet connection. Either way,
<br>
the effect is those 2 people would learn to read each other's minds. Telepathy.
<br>
In my experience, it feels like mind over matter is done the same way as
<br>
telepathy, and the matter is just somebody else's brain. Its a very small
<br>
physical force even after months of practice, but I expect if its done more
<br>
accurately using Bayesian Networks and some preprocessing on the inputs and
<br>
outputs for timing, then it could be learned to a much higher skill level, and
<br>
we could build machines to do it too.
<br>
<p>It can be done in machines by using the timing of network events as quantum data
<br>
(Did it come at an even or odd millisecond in this multiverse?) and sending Lisp
<br>
code in the network packets to build up random Lisp software at each computer in
<br>
the network. The Lisp software will observe the data coming in, keep a very
<br>
small state, and choose what data goes out. When it aligns with other
<br>
multiverses which have the same data and state at each node, the pasts and
<br>
futures from that multiverse will be the statistical influcence that allows this
<br>
to be used, in a very weak way, as a statistical alpha-point computer, which I
<br>
think is the same thing as telepathy but in a more digital way. Brains are more
<br>
analog so it works better. About my name here: the lispunit part means any
<br>
subset of the multiverse. In this case, its the part I'm currently experiencing.
<br>
<p>After that is working, people would start to use it and it would spread quickly
<br>
until everyone on Earth who wanted to learn telepathy and other mental abilities
<br>
would learn to do it through the artificial intelligence network (Human AI Net)
<br>
which I am planning. In my experience, it will have no effect on those who do
<br>
not want to participate, but I expect that if enough people tried at the same
<br>
time to access the thoughts of one who did not want to participate, it would
<br>
work. I see society changing quickly in the last few years toward acting more
<br>
like 1 system instead of 7 billion individuals. I see power shifting away from
<br>
cental authorities and becoming more peer-to-peer (not just in computers, but in
<br>
everything). But I also expect that a small fraction of those with a lot of
<br>
power will refuse to let society change in those ways, and I expect they would
<br>
use their power to destroy things and cause more global problems near the time
<br>
such gradual changes in society would obsolete them. If we had enough people who
<br>
could read minds, then those few people could not dodge accountability and hide
<br>
behind government secrets. They would have to become less aggressive, unless it
<br>
was really necessary, with such telepaths observing. For the purpose of avoiding
<br>
World War 3, and to advance the way the Human species can communicate, we should
<br>
create such bayesian psychology software to create a global telepathy network
<br>
(which usually you can choose to join or not at any time, or any gradual level
<br>
between).
<br>
<p>After its up and running, you don't need the computers to keep it running, but
<br>
they can be used to connect it to the internet through other kinds of artificial
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>SL3 is defined as &quot;Nanotechnology, human-equivalent AI, minor intelligence
<br>
enhancement, uploading, total body revision, intergalactic exploration.
<br>
Extropians and transhumanists.&quot;
<br>
SL4 is defined as &quot;The Singularity, Jupiter Brains, Powers, complete mental
<br>
revision, ultraintelligence, posthumanity, Alpha-Point computing, Apotheosis,
<br>
the total evaporation of &quot;life as we know it.&quot;  Singularitarians and not much
<br>
else.&quot;
<br>
The global telepathy network is a type of &quot;powers&quot; (even though we know how they
<br>
work) and is somewhere between a Turing Machine and &quot;Alpha-Point computing&quot;
<br>
(multiverse recursions). Its only a small amount alpha-point because it only
<br>
uses such multiverse recursions statistically. It doesn't get the return value
<br>
or influence them much. The global telepathy network would be categorized as an
<br>
SL4 event, regardless of how weak it is, because its the type of event instead
<br>
of the magnitude. I expect we will learn to use it in stronger ways eventually.
<br>
<p>It will work because the Kolmogorov Complexity of the universe is 0, or as Max
<br>
Tegmark says it: &quot;All structures that exist mathematically exist also
<br>
physically.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/humanainet">http://sourceforge.net/projects/humanainet</a> (Human AI Net) will be an
<br>
Artificial General Intelligence (and a Friendly AI unless the core AI parts are
<br>
designed wrong). The global telepathy network will only be a plugin for it. I
<br>
separated the mad-science parts from the easier to understand parts. Do any of
<br>
you mad-scientists want to help with any of this?
