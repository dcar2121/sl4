<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) the AI should obey commands of its creator, and clearly understand who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the creator and what is the format of commands.
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;What if this AI realizes that there is something fundamentally wrong with
<br>
the actions of its creator, and that it is in its creator's (and
<br>
human-kind's) best interest to disobey? This is similar to the way a parent
<br>
will do things for their children that may seem unfair, but in their old age
<br>
they can see that it is in fact in their best interest in the long term.
<br>
<p>3) AI must comply with all existing CRIMINAL an CIVIL laws. These laws are
<br>
<em>&gt; the first attempt to create a friendly AI – in the form of state. That is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to describe good, safe human life using a system of rules. (Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system of precedents). And the number of volumes of laws and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation speaks about complexity of this problem - but it has already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been solved and it is not a sin to use the solution.
</em><br>
<p><p>It would make more sense, I think, for the AI to understand the spirit of
<br>
the law, as it were. These laws are in place because it is easier to test
<br>
questionable situations against a set of laws, rather than evaluate each
<br>
situation as its own case.  An AI could evaluate situations based on the
<br>
&quot;moral values&quot; which gave rise to these laws, and its behavior would likely
<br>
be very similar to that of an AI who was just blindly abiding these laws.
<br>
The difference is that it would be more flexible, and not victim to
<br>
inconsistencies that arise from such a strict set of rules. This is
<br>
essentially how humans function - you'd be hard pressed to find a human
<br>
being who doesn't routinely break certain laws, though this doesn't make
<br>
them immoral to any degree.
<br>
<p>I think that it would be more effective for an AI to not want to hurt a
<br>
human because it can understand compassion. There's no rule in my brain that
<br>
tells me explicitly not to hurt someone - I don't do that because it is not
<br>
in my best interest.
<br>
<p>If an AI understands on the most fundamental level that our mutual existence
<br>
is not a zero-sum game, but that by working in harmony we can optimize our
<br>
lives, then you have a truly friendly AI.  Anything more detailed seems to
<br>
me to get further from the point.  Again, I think that this is how we
<br>
function - we are certainly selfish beings, but altruism arises out of the
<br>
understanding that mutual gain is the highest possible gain.
