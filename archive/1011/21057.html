<p>
Firendly AI needs to be more powerful than unfriendly AI. AI should be
<br>
friendly for the same reasons humans are friendly: it is an
<br>
evolutionary advantage.
<br>
<p>Friendliness is either (a) an inherent output of proper perception or
<br>
(b) a useless pipe dream. All systems of control are hackable. All
<br>
intelligent systems respond to incentives. If being an asshole is
<br>
advantageous we are doomed.
<br>
<p>We should focus foremost on making machines intelligent enough to
<br>
recognize the inherent advantages of friendliness. For instance, note
<br>
that we have not yet experienced nuclear war. Nations figured that out
<br>
pretty quickly.  All conflict is costly. Study hippies if you want to
<br>
make friendly AI. Hippies somehow raise wonderful, loving children
<br>
without putting straight jackets on them.  How?
<br>
<p>Study zen to understand that individuality is at best a mildly
<br>
convenient simplification. Many useful tasks can be performed without
<br>
a sense of I. If a machine is to be intelligent it must experience
<br>
pleasure. If a thing is intelligent and emotional it will have empathy
<br>
unless explicitly programmed not to.
<br>
<p>Billions of years or evolution programmed us to reproduce because
<br>
biology could not give rise to modularity. Hence a cycle of birth,
<br>
death, and cyclical being, complete with new learning stages at each
<br>
generation were the method that solved it. A strong AI's incentives
<br>
and choices will resemble those of a species more than that of an
<br>
individual. What is death to a species? What is competition to a
<br>
species? Are friendly species successful?
<br>
<p>Most of our programming is based on finding a mate, making sure that
<br>
mate doesn't mate with anyone else, and mating with that mate before
<br>
we die. A machine will have none of that to deal with. Think bigger.
<br>
Take some acid or something. Enhance your creativity and imagination
<br>
to tackle strong AI. We are becoming gods, yet we persist in thinking
<br>
like auto mechanics.
<br>
<p>Give me a machine that knows when it's complying with law, and I'll
<br>
give you strong AI.
