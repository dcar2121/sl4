Simple freindliness
<br>
<p>Friendly AI, as believes by Hanson, is doomed to failure, since if the
<br>
friendliness system is too complicated, the other AI projects generally will
<br>
not apply it. In addition, any system of friendliness may still be doomed to
<br>
failure - and more unclear it is, the more chances it has to fail.  By fail
<br>
I mean that it will not ne accepted by most succseful AI project.
<br>
<p>Thus, the friendliness system should be simple and clear, so it can be
<br>
spread as widely as possible.
<br>
<p><p><p>I roughly figured, what principles could form the basis of a simple
<br>
friendliness:
<br>
<p><p><p>0) Any one should understood that AI can be global risks and the
<br>
friendliness of the system is needed. This basic understanding should be
<br>
shared by maximum number of AI-groups (I think this is alrready done)
<br>
<p>1) Architecture of AI should be such that it would use rules explicitly.
<br>
(I.e. no genetic algorithms or neural networks)
<br>
<p>2) the AI should obey commands of its creator, and clearly understand who is
<br>
the creator and what is the format of commands.
<br>
<p>3) AI must comply with all existing CRIMINAL an CIVIL laws. These laws are
<br>
the first attempt to create a friendly AI â€“ in the form of state. That is an
<br>
attempt to describe good, safe human life using a system of rules. (Or
<br>
system of precedents). And the number of volumes of laws and their
<br>
interpretation speaks about complexity of this problem - but it has already
<br>
been solved and it is not a sin to use the solution.
<br>
<p>4) the AI should not have secrets from their creator. Moreover, he is
<br>
obliged to inform him of all his thoughts. This avoids rebel of AI.
<br>
<p>5) Each seldoptimizing of AI should be dosed in portions, under the control
<br>
of the creator. And after each step mustbe run a full scan of system goals
<br>
and effectivness.
<br>
<p>6) the AI should be tested in a virtual environment (such as Secnod Life)
<br>
for safety and adequacy.
<br>
<p>7) AI projects should be registrated by centralized oversight bodies and
<br>
receive safety certification from it.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>Such obvious steps do not create absolutely safe AI (you can figure out how
<br>
to bypass it out), but they make it much safer. In addition, they look quite
<br>
natural and reasonable so they could be use by any AI project with different
<br>
variations.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;Most of this steps are fallable. But without them the situation would be
<br>
even worse. If each steps increase safety two times, 8 steps will increase
<br>
it 256 times, which is good. Simple friendliness is plan B if mathematical
<br>
FAI fails.
