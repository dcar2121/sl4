Hi Brad. I more or less agree with what you say, but the main points I
<br>
am trying to make are:
<br>
1 - I walk with a magic device in my pocket, which lets me communicate
<br>
within seconds with nearly everyone in the western world. I have a
<br>
magic box in my living room which lets me see live events on the other
<br>
side of the planet. Today Google is launching a new Internet (another
<br>
magic thing) communication system to let people work together at a
<br>
speed unconceivable a few years ago. Women wear ties and we cannot
<br>
smoke in public places... my grandfather would have called _this_ a
<br>
singularity. Yet we cope with all these things, and our kids don't
<br>
even notoce them. Unknowable, yes: for us, today. Our grandchildren
<br>
will swim in accelerating change like fish in the water.
<br>
2 - Of course progress will not be clean and fast, but troobled and
<br>
messy. A stone falls an acceleated fall... until its movement is
<br>
slowed to linear by the friction of the air.
<br>
3 - So I don't make a religion of Singularity... but I like it anyway.

<em>&gt;  What you write is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly interesting to read. However, I cannot help but point out that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely failing to perceive the concept of the word singularity. To say ‘technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity’ is tantamount to saying ‘drug’. It is totally generic and general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the vast implications we face. I agree with you that there will not be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological singularity. There will be multiple singularities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You spend a great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal of effort speaking about the AI and FAI aspects of singularity as if this addresses the entire issue. Computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gain in information processing speed, information processing amount and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information processing complexity at quite predictable rates. The human mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does none of these things very well. Placed on a graph beside each other a day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will come when AI reaches human levels and then the next day we will see it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceed them. This is not speculation.  An
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI singularity cannot not occur unless the human species fails to bring it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about by not surviving long enough to achieve it or by some social means like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technophobia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  This is how you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focused on the singularity but this is not the only way that a technological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity might occur. In a nanotechnological singularity mankind might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolve rather rapidly. Microscopic machines might filter through our DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminating any disease at first, then improving upon what we have.  Homosapien might jump into a pool only to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately transformed into homoaquaticus to better suit the environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Physical immortality could be achieved within this scenario as well as global devastation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via our beloved grey goo scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  There are mind-machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interface versions of the singularity and biotechnological singularities which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be conceived. Any aspect or facet of technology has implied known and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknowable potential singularities. Within the definition of ‘singularity’ must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include the unknowable. Our minds cannot presently fathom what might occur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just like a black hole in outer space. So when you say that you do not believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the singularity: You really are missing the point altogether.
