&nbsp;&nbsp;What you write is
highly interesting to read. However, I cannot help but point out that you are
entirely failing to perceive the concept of the word singularity. To say ‘technological
singularity’ is tantamount to saying ‘drug’. It is totally generic and general
to the vast implications we face. I agree with you that there will not be a
technological singularity. There will be multiple singularities.
  You spend a great
deal of effort speaking about the AI and FAI aspects of singularity as if this addresses the entire issue. Computers
gain in information processing speed, information processing amount and
information processing complexity at quite predictable rates. The human mind
does none of these things very well. Placed on a graph beside each other a day
will come when AI reaches human levels and then the next day we will see it
exceed them. This is not speculation.  An
AI singularity cannot not occur unless the human species fails to bring it
about by not surviving long enough to achieve it or by some social means like
technophobia. 
  This is how you have
focused on the singularity but this is not the only way that a technological
singularity might occur. In a nanotechnological singularity mankind might
evolve rather rapidly. Microscopic machines might filter through our DNA
eliminating any disease at first, then improving upon what we have.  Homosapien might jump into a pool only to be
immediately transformed into homoaquaticus to better suit the environment.
Physical immortality could be achieved within this scenario as well as global devastation
via our beloved grey goo scenario.
  There are mind-machine
interface versions of the singularity and biotechnological singularities which
could be conceived. Any aspect or facet of technology has implied known and
unknowable potential singularities. Within the definition of ‘singularity’ must
include the unknowable. Our minds cannot presently fathom what might occur.
Just like a black hole in outer space. So when you say that you do not believe
in the singularity: You really are missing the point altogether.
