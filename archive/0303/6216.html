<p>
On measurement here, I do agree the problem is fuzzy, but isn't it akin
<br>
to deciding where, say, the forest ends and the meadow begins?  We do
<br>
know when were deep in the forest.  We also pretty much find it easy to
<br>
pick up when we out in the meadow away from the forest, but there's that
<br>
fuzzy area where there's less trees than in the deepest forest, but it's
<br>
not all meadow.
<br>
<p>But I've always thought a singularity would be a discontinuity.  Of
<br>
course, on one scale, it might seem a smooth transition, but on the
<br>
usually scale we're used to measuring [technological] change -- days,
<br>
months, years, decades -- it will seem almost like a quantum jump to a
<br>
new state.  (Of course, in a way, technological and other social changes
<br>
are, on some level, grainy.  A new invention released today was no here
<br>
yesterday and now becomes part of our technological landscape.)
<br>
<p>As for Michael Anissimov's question on definitions:  I haven't the
<br>
foggiest, though I'd be interested in hearing his and other people's.
<br>
Perhaps in the flux of definitions, some progress can be had.:)
<br>
<p>That's my two cents!
