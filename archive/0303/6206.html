<p>Of course we don't *know* *what* genetically altered super-humans would
<br>
bother to do, so perhaps it does pay to be cautious. But Paul's typo rather
<br>
nicely captures what's wrong with Bill McKibben's book and others like it:
<br>
they're all examples of sic-fi, the fiction of the unaltered prior, the
<br>
literally repeated error. (`Sic', as you will doubtless know, is shorthand
<br>
for `what he said'.) `Sic-fi' combines neatly (and horrifyingly) the twin
<br>
errors of supposing that what has been ought ethically and aesthetically
<br>
always continue to be, except that due to `fallen man' whatever awful
<br>
things happened in the past will be repeated, but on an awfuller scale. 
<br>
<p>In a talk at a Smithsonian Seminar at the Library of Congress in 1999, the
<br>
Canadian sf writer Robert Sawyer mentioned a TV program where he'd defended
<br>
the uses of science and technology against the complaints of a social
<br>
services worker. &quot;...her clincher argument was this--I  swear to God, I'm
<br>
not making this up: &quot;We should be careful about devoting too much time to
<br>
science. The people who lived in Atlantis were obsessed with science, and
<br>
that led to their downfall&quot;' (FOUNDATION, Autumn 2000).
<br>
<p>Sic fi, semper fi, sick fic. What we need, of course, is sic fix.
