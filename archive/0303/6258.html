<p>That is not &quot;rescue&quot;.  That is the same tragedies on fast-forward.  It
<br>
would not seem to be helpful in any way.

<p>There is a very simple test that can detect a Friendly SI in your
<br>
vicinity.  Hold out your hand and say:  &quot;I want a banana.&quot;  If you don't
<br>
get a banana, there are no Friendly SIs capable of helping you.  Note that
<br>
you should be careful not to conduct this test in the presence of a human
<br>
altruist if there is a banana nearby, as the &quot;banana test&quot; will then
<br>
produce a false positive.
<br>
<p>There is a vast amount of rationalized literature attempting to defend
<br>
various religions from the obvious and perfectly straightforward
<br>
conclusion that any moral God would intervene to stop the tragedies of our
<br>
world.  These speculations percolate into the consciousness of many
<br>
vaguely spiritual people and predispose them to rationalize elaborate
<br>
reasons for a Friendly SI allowing medieval torture chambers, or for that
<br>
matter modern torture chambers.  I think such explanations are simply
<br>
bull; they are blatantly rationalized, blatantly inconsistent arguments
<br>
concocted to explain an assumption which is simply false.  No, it is *not*
<br>
moral for a Friendly SI, or any kind of moral God, to let people suffer
<br>
and die.  There simply aren't any Friendly SIs here, and we have
<br>
absolutely no legitimate reason to dream up these elaborate explanations
<br>
for why suffering is good.
<br>
<p>Furthermore I think such explanations are harmful to the moral growth of
<br>
those who embrace them, despite the good intentions of the rationalizers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is not moral to let people suffer and die.  And you should not
<br>
start dreaming up reasons why it is, or you'll end up twisting yourself
<br>
into less than you could be.  Letting people suffer is wrong, and if you
<br>
start rationalizing arguments into your moral system to make it okay,
<br>
you'll end up with a warped morality.  You have no *reason* to start
<br>
inventing reasons why suffering is good, and every reason to oppose
<br>
suffering wherever you find it.  And if you find yourself tempted to
<br>
construct vague excuses, I suggest you find some nice photos of dead
<br>
children in the latest world conflict (there's always one somewhere), and
<br>
look at those photos while you think; you may find that it helps you to
<br>
clear your mind.
