<p>This clearly does not live up to our notion of Singularity.  If it did 
<br>
I think a Singularity happened in 1992 when I first got on the 
<br>
Internet.  Another one happened when the glory of Google came into my 
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>Clearly we can think about the past, so there are no 
<br>
retro-Singularities.  Even if you may find it difficult, we have 
<br>
records and accounts with which we can reconstruct how it was.  Even 
<br>
into prehistory we can determine enough about what the world was like 
<br>
(i.e. not too too different from todays world:  everyone still ate, 
<br>
slept, and fucked) that it's not impossible to imagine what it would be 
<br>
like.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;are we living in a post Singularity world?&quot;, no because someone 
<br>
actually imagined many of the things we take for granted today.  True, 
<br>
it wasn't all one person, nor did any one person or group of people 
<br>
develop an accurate prediction of what the future would be like, but 
<br>
they had some general idea of the things to come.
<br>
<p>A Singularity is where what happens afterwards you cannot predict with 
<br>
any degree of certainty.  If you can assign a probability greater that 
<br>
is significantly different from 0 to a possible future scenario, it's 
<br>
not a Singularity (or it is and you're just fooling yourself).
<br>
<p>This should be addressed somewhere in the archives on in an FAQ or bit 
<br>
of documentation somewhere Online (but I can't recall if it's actually 
<br>
in the archives or not, so I'm now putting it in the archives if it's 
<br>
not already).
