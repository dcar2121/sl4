Robin posted his essay
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.digitalkingdom.org/~rlpowell/rants/simulation_errors.html">http://www.digitalkingdom.org/~rlpowell/rants/simulation_errors.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Here are some of my reactions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I simply think that an intelligence with the capacity to keep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of billions of other intelligences in its head (and collate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and manage those states and the states of those intelligences'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments and so on and so on) would be many, many times more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated than all of the intelligences it is managing combined. 
</em><br>
<p>This is certainly a very good point, and must affect anyone's
<br>
estimate of *when* such a simulation will be possible.
<br>
<p>The most difficult point of the paper, and an admittedly difficult
<br>
point of Nick Bostrom's thesis, is attempting to gather some idea
<br>
of the amount of compute power necessary.  I believe that Nick
<br>
said that one would have to simulate down to the level of atoms,
<br>
and you are saying that it must go beyond that.
<br>
<p>I don't think so at all, but rather than make a detailed argument,
<br>
I'll just present an analogy.  Apparently to the human eye an
<br>
entire scene before it is laid out with the same detail: out
<br>
of the corner of your eye, for example, it appears to you that
<br>
the world's information is being conveyed to you in the same
<br>
density as it is at the point you're directly staring.  But
<br>
it's well known to students of vision that this is an illusion:
<br>
when a computer is used to badly blur every point of one's vision
<br>
except the very most central portion one is looking at at a certain
<br>
instant, one is not conscious of any difference.
<br>
<p>In just the same way, suppose that you *are* living in a simulation.
<br>
Just on what are you basing your intuition concerning the accuracy of
<br>
the simulation so far?  Only on your memories, and they're obviously
<br>
under the control of this hyper-intelligent program.  From this and
<br>
similar arguments it follows that the actual compute power necessary
<br>
to render your current experience has been greatly exaggerated.
<br>
<p>Moral Issues
<br>
------------
<br>
<p>In a not unrelated way, the same thing applies to one's notions of
<br>
exactly how much pain was caused by the Mongol invasion of China,
<br>
because when it really comes down to it, you can testify about no
<br>
one's pain but your own.  Suppose that someone you love, however,
<br>
is badly mangled in an automobile accident, and apparently undergoes
<br>
great suffering.  Note that at any particular moment you are
<br>
actually communicating with this individual, most of the testimony
<br>
as to the person's suffering has to do with the individual's memories
<br>
of that suffering.  Perhaps the only actual suffering that ever occurs
<br>
happens only at the precise moments when you are engaging certain
<br>
of this loved one's faculties, and that at other times, only the
<br>
*memories* of suffering are being added.
<br>
<p>(This is part of the larger point that heretofore in human history,
<br>
memory accumulation and experience have been inseparable.  But in
<br>
the near future, as was depicted in the movie Total Recall, this
<br>
need no longer be the case.  One can have memories of events
<br>
without actually undergoing the corresponding experiences, and one
<br>
can have experiences without accumulating memories!  I won't digress
<br>
here on the difference between portrayals and emulations, but the
<br>
moral issues, of course, concern only emulations.  I.e., we must
<br>
assume that a number of real human beings actually experienced
<br>
charging into China on small ponies.)
<br>
<p>Therefore not only is this* possibly a near pain-free emulation, but
<br>
I'm surprised that theologians haven't used a form of the above
<br>
argument to enable them to suppose that God did after all create
<br>
the best of all possible worlds, vindicating Dr. Pangloss.
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin
<br>
<p>*The tricky word &quot;this&quot; is a multiple valued pointer, refering
<br>
both to simulations and to originals in the multiverse; here I
<br>
mean to distinguish, perhaps with an outside observer's help,
<br>
one particular simulation.
