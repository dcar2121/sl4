Take a step back and listen to how you formed these sentences:
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Christian Szegedy&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:szegedy@or.uni-bonn.de?Subject=Re:%20Has%20the%20Singularity%20already%20happened?">szegedy@or.uni-bonn.de</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm,  &quot;Change&quot; is not a physical  quantity that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be measured.
</em><br>
<p>Huh? If you can't measure or recognize the (physical) state of something at
<br>
two different points in time, how can you detect change?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Of course, you could say that even today nobody can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become an expert without paper, pen, books and internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is also a form of augmentation. (I don't think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true (you can even be a great  computer scientist without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using computers at all), but we can assume it.)
</em><br>
<p>I most definately will not assume it. In fact when I was getting my CS
<br>
degree one of my lecturers was horrified by the fact that most of us did not
<br>
have personal computers and only used them when we had to do assignments in
<br>
the lab every so often. However, I do know a MENSA level genius who wrote a
<br>
large software system, got thrown in jail for murder, and now maintains his
<br>
legacy code (VMS, BASIC) using paper and pencil and dictation over the phone
<br>
to a secretary. The key here is that if you're going to do either
<br>
programming or science on a computer system, you need some sort of access to
<br>
a computer. Otherwise, you may consider me an Olympic athlete, even if it is
<br>
only in my own mind.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is somewhat arbitrary and not well defined, (using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a computer display could also be viewed as a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;neural augmentation&quot;) but perhaps it is still clearer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than any other definitions so far.
</em><br>
<p>I think that there are a lot better definitions if you actually look for
<br>
them (and participation in discussions like this is a good source of
<br>
answers). But don't ever assume that because you see something as nebulous
<br>
and indefinable doesn't make it so.
<br>
<p><p>The point of my response here is that I was concerned about the assumptions
<br>
you made. It's almost as if you're trying to claim that you have some sort
<br>
of cleverness so as to make absolute statements like &quot;change cannot be
<br>
measured&quot; and &quot;augmentation is arbitrarily defined&quot;. I think you have shown
<br>
a couple of your limiting beliefs and stated them as facts, which in turn
<br>
affects how you (and possibly others) think about the topic of discussion.
<br>
Human augmentation and the Singularity cannot be discussed with limiting
<br>
beliefs such as this.
<br>
<p>cheers,
