Hmmm,  &quot;Change&quot; is not a physical  quantity that can
<br>
be measured.  I don't think that this had any essence.
<br>
<p>For me the most objective definition of singularity would be
<br>
that it is the time when no nonaugmented human mind can
<br>
master expertise in any technological field.  By expertise
<br>
I mean *state of the art* (let us say, above the average)
<br>
ability and knowledge in some field.
<br>
A weak point is the definition of &quot;unaugmented&quot;.  
<br>
Of course, you could say that even today nobody can
<br>
become an expert without paper, pen, books and internet
<br>
which is also a form of augmentation. (I don't think it's
<br>
true (you can even be a great  computer scientist without
<br>
using computers at all), but we can assume it.) Therefore,
<br>
I would draw the line at augmentation at &quot;hardware&quot; level:
<br>
i.e. at neuronal or genetic level augmentation.
<br>
This is somewhat arbitrary and not well defined, (using
<br>
a computer display could also be viewed as a form of
<br>
&quot;neural augmentation&quot;) but perhaps it is still clearer
<br>
than any other definitions so far.
<br>
<p>To put it simply: &quot;Singularity happens when the
<br>
old fashioned human hardware becomes obsolete&quot;.
