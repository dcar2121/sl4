</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>OK, what is the measurement unit of the &quot;Change&quot;? :)
<br>
I refereed to the &quot;change&quot; in Danis posting (therefore the
<br>
quoting).  He used &quot;change&quot; in  some &quot;Things are not that
<br>
they used to be&quot; sense. I don't think it makes much sense
<br>
to put numbers before such an unspecified subjective
<br>
concept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Of course, you could say that even today nobody can
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I most definately will not assume it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I share your view on it (as I already explicitely stated). I just
<br>
assumed it as a kind of worst case assumption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The point of my response here is that I was concerned about the assumptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you made. It's almost as if you're trying to claim that you have some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of cleverness so as to make absolute statements like &quot;change cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;measured&quot; and &quot;augmentation is arbitrarily defined&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No, my point was: some kind of unpecified &quot;Change&quot; is not measurable
<br>
while &quot;augmented human&quot; is a much better (although not completely well)
<br>
defined concept.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I jut made clear what I really mean under &quot;neuronally or genetically
<br>
augmented&quot; in order to justify my definition of Singularity.  
<br>
I wrote that I did not want to consider traditional augmentation
<br>
and therefore pinned down that Singularity did not happend according
<br>
to my definition even (perhaps, I don't think so) it could have
<br>
happened  (according to my definition) if I had allowed
<br>
traditional augmentations. (Therefore, I simply explicitely excluded it.)
<br>
<p>Intellectual honesty lead me to admit that even this (I think
<br>
failry objective) definition is a bit blurred, but I think it is still
<br>
usable.
<br>
<p>It seems that you completely missed my points because of
<br>
a completely superficial reading of my posting.
