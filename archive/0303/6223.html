I think if you attempt this argument at a surface layer it will be 
<br>
difficult... better to dig deeper into specific trends such as computing 
<br>
power, and try to determine specifically why they will or won't continue 
<br>
trending. With computing power you can trace its progress through at 
<br>
least 4 or 5 different technologies/paradigms, from mechanical relays to 
<br>
transistors to microchips. Each time a particular technique for 
<br>
computing maxed out, a new way came along.
<br>
<p>We are running into an interesting spot currently where chip 
<br>
manufacturing is running into a bit of a wall economically. The problem 
<br>
is a combination of the fact that it costs more and more money for 
<br>
companies to switch to each new advanced lithography process, while at 
<br>
the same time transistor tech in general has gotten good enough that 
<br>
many classes of devices work perfectly well using older manufacturing 
<br>
processes (in many cases they actually may work _worse_ if translated to 
<br>
the new processes due to increased current leakage and other reasons). 
<br>
So the effect for instance at foundry companies like Taiwan Semi is that 
<br>
there are fewer and fewer customers interested in paying for more and 
<br>
more advanced processes due to both the cost and the lack of need. I 
<br>
can't post it due to copyright issues, but this was described with some 
<br>
nice graphs in the Dec 02 Gilder Tech Report. They call the idea the 
<br>
&quot;value transistor&quot; - each particular computing device has a particular 
<br>
litho process that its price/performance peaks on.
<br>
<p>So is Moore's Law going kaput soon due to economics? At the moment I 
<br>
don't think so. Other, more leading edge, areas of computing aside from 
<br>
foundries, from supercomputing to PC CPUs still seem to have enough need 
<br>
for the upcoming litho processes that we should continue onwards down 
<br>
past 90nm without any worries. Then later on in this decade there will 
<br>
likely begin to be some serious alternate manufacturing processes (there 
<br>
are many ways under development and research currently) that will either 
<br>
take us into a new phase past &quot;microchips&quot; or will at least make the 
<br>
economics and performance of new chip processes dramatically more 
<br>
appealing. There is a legitimate worry that software needs will not keep 
<br>
pace and that demand for higher performance graphics and &quot;PCs&quot; will die 
<br>
off, but I think gaming and other advanced uses will save the day. (I'm 
<br>
looking forward to see what that 1 teraflop PlayStation 3 will be able 
<br>
to do :-) Supercomputers are iffy too, but I think there will be enough 
<br>
government and other demand to keep them advancing at least through this 
<br>
decade.
