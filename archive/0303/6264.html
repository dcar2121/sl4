<p><em>&gt; &gt; [Eliezer wrote:]

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; That is not &quot;rescue&quot;.  That is the same tragedies on fast-forward.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Eli,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Could you please clarify this position?  Why would you consider an SI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uploading us into their domain a tragedy, and what is fast-forward??
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would consider an SI uploading us into their domain, and then leaving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events on Earth completely untouched, a &quot;tragedy&quot; to exactly the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree that those events would be a tragedy wherever they occurred. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Medieval torture chamber inside an SI, medieval torture chamber outside an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SI, it makes no difference.  A medieval torture chamber running in faster 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing time is the same tragedy in fast-forward, like the fast-forward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; button on your VCR or DVD or whatever.  At least it's fast-forward from an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external perspective; internally, of course, it's the same computation.
</em><br>
<p>In other words, compared to what should or could be taking
<br>
place, our current situation is intolerable.  Far too many
<br>
entities on Earth are experiencing too little joy, and too
<br>
much unhappiness.  Far too little of the available matter
<br>
and energy within easy reach is not being used to benefit
<br>
entities.  After a singularity has occurred, on the other
<br>
hand, it will seem so obvious and so necessary to all the
<br>
survivors that pre-Singularity denizens were deprived
<br>
and denied almost beyond words.
<br>
<p>The real tragedy aspect, however, is that the advent of such
<br>
an uncaring SI (much as it was hypothesized applied to the
<br>
case of our former lord Jehovah) bespeaks the present of near
<br>
omniscience with complete lack of sympathy---and what could
<br>
spell disaster any clearer than that?
<br>
<p>Yet an even worse by far characteristic to the tragedy is
<br>
that such an SI would doubtless preclude the emergence of
<br>
Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>Just my two cents.  Hope it helps.
<br>
<p>Lee
