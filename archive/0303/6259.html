<em>&gt; &gt; By now, we should have seen a large portion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the visible universe converted to computronium.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm hesitant to be so terse about this, but it has always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been my expectation that perhaps there already has been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity somewhere/when else and its results are simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond our comprehension
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  I would call this the &quot;side-effect hypothesis&quot;, namely
<br>
that we may exist between the cracks of tremendous processes
<br>
busily utilizing almost all the total resources.  (If the big
<br>
S didn't happen here, or to us, then I don't see much chance
<br>
of it running simulations of us.)
<br>
<p>In this way I suppose that a vastly greater civilization could
<br>
have already swept through whatever region of space we occupied.
<br>
But I think that I would also then be forced to suppose that all
<br>
our compute potential, assuming we're real at all, to be of
<br>
negligible utility to that entity/civilization.
<br>
<p>However!  This would violate the &quot;Lust to Complete Expansion&quot;
<br>
that I was describing before, and equivalently, go counter to
<br>
Eliezer's persuasive contention that there are no conserved
<br>
quantities (that would inhibit expansion).  Our instincts to
<br>
suppose that either attention or software cannot be readily
<br>
and freely multiplied must be a legacy of our &lt;=H heritage.
<br>
<p>Next, you address the moral dimension
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [a singularity somewhere] such that any moral questions we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have for it are resolved quickly and easily for an omniscient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being (like a universe-encompassing post-singularity mind)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not at all for us.
</em><br>
<p>I think that what you are saying is that it can resolve
<br>
any moral question that we can conceive of, whether or
<br>
not *we* could resolve it.
<br>
<p>Well, this sounds to me like it's an attempted crossing
<br>
of the is/ought barrier.  How should we know what's 
<br>
important to an SI?  If we are &quot;living between the cracks&quot;
<br>
then, as those unforgettable processes in &quot;A Fire Beyond
<br>
the Sky&quot; whispered,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We should not be.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Talking like this?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Talking at all.&quot;
<br>
<p>But we *do* know what kind of SI we'd like to see happen, and
<br>
I thought Eliezer addressed the moral component of that case
<br>
well.
