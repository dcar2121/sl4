The following is from Christian Colquhoun.
<br>
<p>********************************
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm helping to throw a fund raiser! Please consider this as a
<br>
formal declaration of Assistance Requested. Some of you already know
<br>
about the party and have expressed interest in helping, but it certainly
<br>
never hurts to have more talented people involved. If you can't assist,
<br>
then count this as a first invite to come and have fun for a good cause.
<br>
SAVE THE DATE!
<br>
Without further delay, The Institute for Accelerating Change presents:
<br>
<p>Unite the Future!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the future to you? Cyber? Gene-Enhanced? Transhuman? Do
<br>
you see a future of peril and darkness?  Something like Bladerunner or
<br>
maybe Mad Max? Possibly Gibsonesque? Maybe an Infocalypse? Or do you see
<br>
a future of promise and light? A happy, Technotopia with smart and
<br>
cuddly machines?? A lovely, bright, beautiful,
<br>
be-anything-you-want-to-be-kind-of-future?  Maybe a bit of this and a
<br>
byte of that??
<br>
Come to the party, support the cause, express your vision of the future,
<br>
share your imagination, 
<br>
and unite with others in a very fun, very friendly atmosphere.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When: May 17, 2003 Doors opening at 7:30 pm
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where: Applied Effects, 11505 W. Jefferson Blvd, Culver City, CA
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why: This is a fund raiser for The Institute for Accelerating
<br>
Change. Proceeds collected will be going toward our first annual
<br>
Accelerating Change Conference &lt;<a href="http://www.accelerating.org/">http://www.accelerating.org/</a>&gt;  at
<br>
Stanford University on July 17-18th.  Already we have many notable
<br>
speakers committed, including: Walter Truett Anderson
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.pacificnews.org/contributors/anderson/">http://www.pacificnews.org/contributors/anderson/</a>&gt; , James Crawford

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Institute for Accelerating Change is a new Los Angeles-based
<br>
nonprofit.  Our purpose is to help people better realize the
<br>
implications of accelerating technological change.  We do this through
<br>
our websites, conferences, newsletters, gatherings, reading groups,
<br>
media projects, and our sense of community.  We have adopted this
<br>
purpose because increasing the overall understanding of accelerating
<br>
change improves the quality of choices that individuals make, and, in
<br>
turn, the quality of choices that we make as a community.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe the Institute's work will help humanity realize a
<br>
future of ever increasing promise.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who: All inquiries, offers to help, and pretty much anything
<br>
else regarding this event should be directed to Christian Colquhoun
<br>
&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:mechfx@earthlink.net?Subject=FW:%20A%20party%20in%20the%20works!">mechfx@earthlink.net</a>&gt;  or Regina Pancake at Applied Effects (see
<br>
above address, phone and fax number).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What: This party will have a dance floor, Cyber fashion show,
<br>
DJ's, bands, entertainment, dancers, Bar, and Lightshow.  Much, much
<br>
more is in the works and to be announced!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cost: We are still working out how much the entrance fee will
<br>
be, but we think it'll be in the 15 - 25 dollar range depending on the
<br>
entertainment provided. It's going to be a good show, and it is a fund
<br>
raiser!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the opening email eliciting and soliciting ideas for the
<br>
party. If you have a vision of the future that you feel needs to be
<br>
seen, then let's talk and find a way to make it fit. I'm looking for all
<br>
sorts of ideas and assistance.  Those who have helped in the past are
<br>
most welcome to do what you do or have done before. And we're always
<br>
looking for new people to join the team.  Let me know!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large donations that allow us to make this event as fun and big
<br>
as possible will be acknowledged immediately and in numerous ways. If
<br>
you have something or want to donate, let's talk about it!
<br>
We have a bunch of fun to arrange! Come and help make this a shared
<br>
vision!
<br>
<p>Thanks for your time.... More to follow soon.
<br>
<p>Join us and Unite the Future!
