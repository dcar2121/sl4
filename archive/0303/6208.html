<p>Hehe, who would've thought someone could extrapolate so much on one little

typo? Good point though. ^_^

<p>Yes, I meant that McKibben saying we're standing at a critical threshold is
<br>
false since we've already passed it, and only a massively global catastrophe
<br>
such as a nanowar, nuclear war, a massive meteor colliding with the Earth et
<br>
cetra, can stop it. No amount of legislature any country can pass, any book
<br>
someone may write, or any number of paranoid Luddites crying out for
<br>
attention while living in shacks in the forest sending poor secretaries
<br>
mail-bombs can stop it from happening, the best they can do is merely delay
<br>
it by a few years.
<br>
<p>Maybe instead of using the term &quot;genetically altered super-humans,&quot; I
<br>
should've said &quot;biologically altered super-humans.&quot; I agree with you; humans
<br>
will be enhanced and augmented by technology to the point at which it is
<br>
questionable to call them humans anymore, but it is more likely this will
<br>
happen through uploading, or integrating nanocomputers into the human body
<br>
some how, not through merely rewriting the human genome (which is what I
<br>
meant originally; I should've worded it better). Does anyone on the list
<br>
(who has read the book or is more familiar with McKibben's arguments) know
<br>
if McKibben talks at all about uploading / human-machine computers, or just
<br>
biological engineering?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Perhaps his book should have been titled: &quot;Caution: Staying Humane in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Engineered Age&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That I like.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I had to give myself a pat on the back after that one :-)
