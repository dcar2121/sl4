As someone who does historical re-enactments for
<br>
a hobby, and whose character is living in 1253 AD,
<br>
I've studied life in that time period.  Aside
<br>
from much stronger religious and superstitious
<br>
belief, people back then were not very different
<br>
from us.  They had to live within the confines
<br>
of much lower technology and material goods, but
<br>
they still got married and raised families,
<br>
went shopping, etc.  One big difference would
<br>
be the lack of an idea of progress, since changes
<br>
were small within an average lifespan back then.
