</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (We cannot see, of course, the approaching wave front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an advancing civilization until it's almost on our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doorstep---which could happen, though, at any moment.)
</em><br>
<p>Furthermore:  Even if the cognitive or technological embodiment of the 
<br>
superintelligence is such that it contains at least one conserved 
<br>
&quot;characteristic&quot;, necessarily involved in any attempt to expand or send 
<br>
out agents, such that any &quot;effort&quot; in that characteristic directed at 
<br>
collapsarity yields greater returns than the same effort directed at 
<br>
expanding to harvest mass, where it is not possible to take both actions 
<br>
simultaneously...
<br>
<p>Then, even so, any *Friendly* SI would still send agents outward to rescue 
<br>
civilizations in distress, unless the moral return on *that* action was 
<br>
also less than the same effort (with respect to the conserved 
<br>
characteristic) directed at collapsarity.  Which is hard to see, though I 
<br>
suppose it might be possible.
<br>
<p>We can generalize the collapsarity explanation of the Fermi Paradox as 
<br>
follows:  Any SI (within range of us) has at least one characteristic with 
<br>
conserved effort or focus of attention, such that even the infinitesimal 
<br>
effort required to spawn physically reproducing computronium-eaters or 
<br>
civilization-rescuers, *always* yields greater computational or moral 
<br>
benefits when directed in some other incredibly fruitful direction.  Note 
<br>
that this direction need not be collapsarity.
<br>
<p>An additional requirement of this explanation is that SIs born out of the 
<br>
same physical space *never ever* compete, for *anything*.  Otherwise it 
<br>
makes sense to send out external probes just to prevent hostile SIs from 
<br>
being born.
<br>
<p>I am highly skeptical.  And I'm even more skeptical when it comes to that 
<br>
theory as an attempt to explain the silence of Friendly SIs.  I'm 
<br>
currently leaning toward the idea that intelligent life really is *just 
<br>
that rare* - nothing in our past light cone.
