Hello everyone,
<br>
<p>I was wondering if any of the list members had a chance to look at the
<br>
following book, and if so what did they make of it? How should
<br>
singularitarians respond to the concerns of individuals like Mr McKibben?
<br>
Are such concerns legitimate?
<br>
<p>Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age
<br>
by Bill McKibben
<br>
Hardcover: 288 pages
<br>
Publisher: Times Books; 1st edition (April 2003)
<br>
ISBN: 0805070966
<br>
<p>Book Description
<br>
<em>&gt;From the bestselling author of The End of Nature comes a passionate plea to
</em><br>
limit the technologies that could change the very definition of who we are.
<br>
We are on the verge of crossing the line from born to made, from created to
<br>
built. Sometime in the next few years, a scientist will reprogram a human
<br>
egg or sperm cell, spawning a genetic change that could be passed down into
<br>
eternity. We are sleepwalking toward the future, argues Bill McKibben, and
<br>
it’s time to open our eyes.In The End of Nature, nearly fifteen years ago,
<br>
McKibben demonstrated that humanity had begun to irrevocably alter—and
<br>
endanger—our environment on a global scale. Now he turns his eye to an array
<br>
of technologies that could change our relationship not with the rest of
<br>
nature but with ourselves. He explores the frontiers of genetic engineering,
<br>
robotics, and nanotechnology—all of which we are approaching with
<br>
astonishing speed—and shows that each threatens to take us past a point of
<br>
no return. We now stand at a critical threshold, poised between the human
<br>
past and a post-human future. Ultimately, McKibben offers a celebration of
<br>
what it means to be human, and a warning that we risk the loss of all
<br>
meaning if we step across the threshold. His wise and eloquent book argues
<br>
that we cannot forever grow in reach and power—that we must at last learn
<br>
how to say, “Enough.”
