Paul had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As intelligence increases tetrationally, it also seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothetically possible that at some point, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only a short while after the singularity, its ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to miniaturize and compactify volumetrically could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerate faster than its needs to expand materially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and volumetrically. So rather than an increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of mass succumbing to computronium conversion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the opposite occurs - an intelligence 'collapsar' in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which the mass used decreases as intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases, resulting in a singularity (in the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of the word).  Further the speed up of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence increase could accelerate so fast, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an effective infinite amount of computation is done in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zero time.
</em><br>
<p>and, in response, I wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My only problem with this is the exclusivity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you seem to apply.  Just because the nanotech or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever at coordinates (x, y, z) gets real smart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real fast and collapses in just the way you say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can simultaneously spawn off a slightly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primitive (i.e. smaller) version of itself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; location (x+dx, y, z) which repeats the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see any reason why such a process would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *forego* converting adjacent material just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its primary interest is &quot;downwards not outwards&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I should add that this adage &quot;downwards not outwards&quot;
<br>
was discussed by a friend and myself over 20 years
<br>
ago.  We were working in silicon valley and could
<br>
see where the ultimate in miniaturization might be
<br>
taking us.  We shoulda published that!
<br>
<p>But the adage is mistaken.  It should be &quot;downwards
<br>
*AND* outwards&quot;.  The impulse towards exclusivity is
<br>
related to our notions of identity, and that it's
<br>
not possible to do more than one thing at the same
<br>
time.  Extended contemplation of the identity paradox
<br>
leads me, along with many others, to insist firmly
<br>
that just because one is here doing one thing does not
<br>
in any way preclude one from being elsewhere doing
<br>
something else.
<br>
<p>(We are familiar with being at two different times
<br>
in the same place, but haven't yet been prepared
<br>
by evolution to accept an equally logical possibility:
<br>
that of being in two different places at the same time!)
<br>
<p>Therefore I propose that your (and John Smart's) idea
<br>
cannot really be a solution to the Fermi Paradox.  For
<br>
there is nothing stopping advanced processes from
<br>
percolation in space simultaneous with concentration
<br>
in space.  By now, we should have seen a large portion
<br>
of the visible universe converted to computronium.
<br>
Since we haven't, we must assume that nobody's out
<br>
there, at least where we can see them in spacetime.
<br>
(We cannot see, of course, the approaching wave front
<br>
of an advancing civilization until it's almost on our
<br>
doorstep---which could happen, though, at any moment.)
