</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This clearly does not live up to our notion of Singularity.  If it

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think a Singularity happened in 1992 when I first got on the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
I actually saw someone call the Internet the Singularity
<br>
(forgot who).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Clearly we can think about the past, so there are no 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. not too too different from todays world:  everyone still ate, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slept, and fucked) that it's not impossible to imagine what it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
I agree. Just because I do not personally know how to make a spear,
<br>
does not mean that the Paleolithic world is incomprehensible to me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for &quot;are we living in a post Singularity world?&quot;, no because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually imagined many of the things we take for granted today.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it wasn't all one person, nor did any one person or group of people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop an accurate prediction of what the future would be like, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they had some general idea of the things to come.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
But doesn't that *always* have to be the case, to some degree?
<br>
If no one can imagine the technologies of the Singularity
<br>
before the Singularity occurs, then no one will be able to
<br>
implement those technologies and bring the Singularity about.
<br>
The Singularity could not happen until it has already happened,
<br>
so it will never get here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A Singularity is where what happens afterwards you cannot predict 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any degree of certainty.  If you can assign a probability greater 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is significantly different from 0 to a possible future scenario, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a Singularity (or it is and you're just fooling yourself).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
When have we been able to predict the future with any degree of
<br>
accuracy, much less certainty? Judging by the tract
<br>
record of science fiction, futurology, etc., it is almost impossible
<br>
to make predictions that are not prone to the giggle factor after
<br>
several decades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This should be addressed somewhere in the archives on in an FAQ or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of documentation somewhere Online (but I can't recall if it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the archives or not, so I'm now putting it in the archives if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not already).
</em><br>

</em><br>
Thank you.
