<p>As long as we do not know that what follows is actually better

and viable we have quite ample reason to cling to what is proven

to more or less work and allows us to continue having such

conversations.

<p>There is no reason global nanotechnology need be pernicious 
<br>
unless you intended the above to parse as &quot;global nanotechnology 
<br>
war OR nuclear war&quot;.  Personally I see no reason why genetically 
<br>
altered super-humans would be the next step.  I can think of 
<br>
several positive next steps that do not require this and that 
<br>
leave us very much alive and happy.  I think it more likely that 
<br>
humans would, depending on the steepness of takeoff, either be 
<br>
augmented by wearable/ubiquitous/implanted computers or 
<br>
uploaded.  I think the genetic modification way is too pokey and 
<br>
will become increasingly irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What he should be arguing is that we should proceed into these

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps his book should have been titled: &quot;Caution: Staying Humane in an
</em><br>

</em><br>
