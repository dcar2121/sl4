<p>
Firstly, I haven't read this book (yet), or any of McKibben's books, but his
<br>
basic argument (outlined in the paragraph below) is not new. McKibben (and
<br>
others which share his thoughts on the matter) seem to believe that the
<br>
current form man is in, or that the current form that nature is in (or was
<br>
before humans polluted it), is the ideal form. So what if we reengineer
<br>
ourselves and manufacturer humans so that they are conceived in incubating
<br>
machines rather than a woman's womb? It wouldn't be &quot;natural,&quot; but it would
<br>
solve many problems (women wouldn't need to go through the pain of child
<br>
birth, carry a child around in them for 9 months, deal with their period
<br>
every month, have to worry about protection during sex, we'd have no need
<br>
for abortion clinics (or abortion clinic protestors who hypocritically kill
<br>
abortion doctors to save lives), etc.) Heck, we wouldn't even need genders
<br>
anymore. This is precisely what they're so afraid of, genetic engineering
<br>
means that there will no longer be women (or men, for that matter), races,
<br>
ethnicities, midgets, birth defects, etc. These gender, racial, ethnical,
<br>
and hierarchical categorizations have been so inherent in everyday life that
<br>
they have trouble imagining life without it.
<br>
<p>They're still thinking in terms of the old Nazi Eugenics, where Hitler
<br>
attempted to create a &quot;master race,&quot; (which, for some reason or another,
<br>
white skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes are the most desirable combination of
<br>
genes) by killing off (or sterilizing) everyone else. A genetically altered
<br>
race of super-humans wouldn't bother to enslave all the rest of the human
<br>
race as bad pop culture sic-fi seems to dictate, if for no other reason than
<br>
he s/he no reason to do so (after all, if we've reached a super-human level
<br>
of technological sophistication, presumably a machine can do any job better
<br>
than a regular old human can). The old humans aren't in need of
<br>
extermination, they just need a body and mind upgrade (something which
<br>
didn't exist in Hitler's time), but not against their will (since many
<br>
religious people will no doubt cling to their &quot;God given bodies&quot; for some
<br>
reason or another). I don't see how anyone can believe that all the genes
<br>
natural selection and the process of evolution strapped us with are somehow
<br>
better than the ones which we can (and will) devise.
<br>
<p>This change will of course, destroy our societies as we know them, and
<br>
probably most of the natural world along with them. But so what? Were they
<br>
REALLY so great to begin with that we should cling to them insistently? When
<br>
new and superior species arise they are bound to displace the older and
<br>
inferior animal species, often leading to the old species' extinction (the
<br>
rise of man is marked most notably by many species disappearing mysteriously
<br>
off the face of the Earth, namely Saber Tooth Tigers and Wholly Mammoths). I
<br>
could just see someone with McKibben's same paradigm, if they somehow
<br>
existed back when early life-forms were first evolving on the Earth, saying
<br>
&quot;Quick! Hand me the antibacterial soap! We must stop these bacteria from
<br>
defiling our precious Earth!&quot;, or perhaps later on &quot;We must stop those evil
<br>
plants from polluting our wonderful atmosphere with their noxious oxygen!&quot;
<br>
<p>Fortunately however we don't HAVE TO follow the way nature works and kill
<br>
all of the &quot;inferior&quot; humans, we're sophisticated enough so that we can
<br>
respect the wishes of other sentient beings wanting to stay the way they are
<br>
(if not out of ignorance), but that does not mean we cannot ascend. I
<br>
believed we crossed the threshold of no return a century ago, barring that a
<br>
global nanotechnology / nuclear war doesn't break out in the next few
<br>
decades, I see no way anyone could stop genetically altered super-humans
<br>
from arising. What he should be arguing is that we should proceed into these
<br>
dangerous new waters with more caution than humans haphazardly had in their
<br>
progress in the early 20th century. We need to think through our invention's
<br>
long term effects and proceed with more caution, not stop all together and
<br>
start moving backwards.
<br>
<p>Perhaps his book should have been titled: &quot;Caution: Staying Humane in an
<br>
Engineered Age&quot;

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Hello everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was wondering if any of the list members had a chance to look at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following book, and if so what did they make of it? How should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularitarians respond to the concerns of individuals like Mr McKibben?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are such concerns legitimate?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Bill McKibben
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hardcover: 288 pages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Publisher: Times Books; 1st edition (April 2003)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ISBN: 0805070966
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Book Description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From the bestselling author of The End of Nature comes a passionate plea
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; limit the technologies that could change the very definition of who we
</em><br>
are.
<br>
<em>&gt; We are on the verge of crossing the line from born to made, from created
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; built. Sometime in the next few years, a scientist will reprogram a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egg or sperm cell, spawning a genetic change that could be passed down
</em><br>
into
<br>
<em>&gt; eternity. We are sleepwalking toward the future, argues Bill McKibben, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it’s time to open our eyes.In The End of Nature, nearly fifteen years ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; McKibben demonstrated that humanity had begun to irrevocably alter—and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endanger—our environment on a global scale. Now he turns his eye to an
</em><br>
array
<br>
<em>&gt; of technologies that could change our relationship not with the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature but with ourselves. He explores the frontiers of genetic
</em><br>
engineering,
<br>
<em>&gt; robotics, and nanotechnology—all of which we are approaching with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; astonishing speed—and shows that each threatens to take us past a point of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no return. We now stand at a critical threshold, poised between the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past and a post-human future. Ultimately, McKibben offers a celebration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it means to be human, and a warning that we risk the loss of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning if we step across the threshold. His wise and eloquent book argues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we cannot forever grow in reach and power—that we must at last learn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to say, “Enough.”
