Hi everyone,
<br>
<p>SIAI's online newsletter, the Singularity Institute Quarterly, is coming
<br>
along nicely and will be released in the last week of April.  If you would
<br>
like to make submissions, please send them to trans_humanism@msn.com.  The
<br>
submission deadline for everything is *April 16* (Wednesday).  Submissions
<br>
can be on the following (if you'd like to submit something not listed,
<br>
please do so, but within reason):
<br>
<p>************************************
<br>
<p>(Submissions should be Singularity-aware [this isn't necessary for all
<br>
spirituality and humor material])
<br>
<p>1. Co-Editorials
<br>
They need to be Singularity-aware and written well-enough to be publishable
<br>
without a lot of editing.  So far, two people have accepted to write one.
<br>
It would definitely be great to have a few more.  ('Feel free to email me if
<br>
you'd like to discuss; if not, that's fine.)
<br>
<p>2. Singularity Institute news and/or Singularity news
<br>
Please submit any news that I may not know about or may accidentally miss.
<br>
<p>3. Singularity quotes and/or other quotes
<br>
Quotes should be appropriately referenced.  If a quote isn't explicitly
<br>
Singularity-related, please tell me the category for it (e.g., leadership,
<br>
compassion).
<br>
<p>4. Articles, papers, books, websites, interviews, multimedia, films, humor,
<br>
comprehensive resources, spirituality/well-being, merchandise
<br>
It would be extremely helpful if a small synopsis about your submission is
<br>
included.  This will help guide my writing, and thus me save *a lot* of
<br>
time.  (Thanks sincerely in advance.)
<br>
<p>************************************
<br>
<p>I can't promise that everything submitted will be useable, but I will try to
<br>
include as much as possible.  (If it doesn't go into the first issue, it may
<br>
be used for the second one.)
<br>
<p>I'll be emailing some of you individually about submissions in the
<br>
near-future.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Anand
