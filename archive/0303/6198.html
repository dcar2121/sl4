Then consider that the world of a medieval monk might be incomprehensible to
<br>
us. If I was dropped into Europe, 1200 AD, I'd probably have quite a tough
<br>
time dealing with society. I might have a better time of it if I studied my
<br>
history and learned Latin, but if I didn't have that history, it'd be
<br>
foreign to me.
<br>
<p>Maybe the Singularity is the world at time T, incomprehensible to anybody
<br>
T-X and T+X except for short periods of time + and - T. Unless the
<br>
Singularity is a purely technological event, but I don't think it is. I
<br>
think I wouldn't have any trouble at all with AD1200 technology, but
<br>
everything else would be a barrier.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if I really have a point here.

Subject: Has the Singularity already happened?

<em>&gt; Perhaps the Singularity means that a the world at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time T is incomprehensible to any person of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; T-X, but not incomprehensible to a person at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shorter time before T. For example, our world would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be incomprehensible to a medieval monk, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a 1950 sci-fi fan. The world of 2100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be understandable to you or me now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but people of 2050 might (with effort) wrap their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads around it. Maybe the world of that medieval monk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be incomprehensible to a Cro-Magnon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sound reasonable?
