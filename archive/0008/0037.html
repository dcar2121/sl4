&gt; My friend, long-time cryonicist and theorist of physical immortality Mike<BR>

&gt; All_.&nbsp; Link to,<BR>

Thanks for the reference.&nbsp; I have begun reading it.&nbsp; The author makes<BR>
two fundamentally questionable and untestable assumptions apparently<BR>
central to his work.&nbsp; The first is the assumption of &quot;Unboundedness&quot; by<BR>
which he apparently manys something closely akin to the Many Worlds<BR>
hypothesis but more personalized.&nbsp; As I understand it he believes that<BR>
all possible reality happenings do happen in some universe including<BR>
alternate versions of you and I. At the least this hypothesis is utterly<BR>
untestable without the ability to visit these alternate universes.&nbsp; It<BR>
does not follow that even given infinite time and infinite extent that<BR>
all possible permutations of all events will occur because the number of<BR>
events, much less their permutations is a higher order infinity (as I<BR>
see it anyway) than the infinity of universes and time.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
The author's second fundamental premise is the premise of<BR>
Interchangeability is a premise that things that are similar enough<BR>
(expressed clumsily by me) are in all interesting aspects identical. In<BR>
particular the author seems to use this and the first hypothesis to say<BR>
that the individual resurrection/recreation of each of us is<BR>
inevitable.&nbsp; But surely this does not follow. For me to be fully<BR>
resurrected would require not only recreating this same DNA patterned<BR>
human being but also somehow keeping and reloading the same knowledge<BR>
and memories.&nbsp; Scientifically you may be able to create a perfect clone<BR>
of me ages hence but unless you have managed to capture and store my<BR>
memories and fundamental knowledge patterns that future being will in no<BR>
real sense be &quot;me&quot;.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
The author tries to distinquish his believe from what he labels<BR>
supernaturalism.&nbsp; Yet these beliefs are to me as incredible as any I've<BR>
seen in any mystical texts.&nbsp; If you are going to believe the above then<BR>
why not believe that the nano (or femto) - technology based superbeing<BR>
already has come to exist in some place/time/universe and having<BR>
transcended all time/universe barriers therefore already exists<BR>
everywhere including right here. If this was so perhaps some of those we<BR>
have called mystics actually manage to tie into a bit of this<BR>
super-being.&nbsp; Such a hypothesis is not much more incredible than the<BR>
above and is similarly difficult if not impossible to test (without the<BR>
cooperation of said being anyway).&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
More thoughts later...<BR>
