&gt; <BR>
&gt; If the jobs can be done more economically and efficiently by automation<BR>
&gt; and AIs in a particular area then what motivation do I as employer have<BR>
&gt; to hire less efficient and highly problematic humans instead?&nbsp; If enough<BR>
&gt; jobs go in this direction then humans will become increasingly<BR>
&gt; unemployable.&nbsp; Unless you believe this is ok if that is the way it is<BR>
&gt; and it is ok that these people starve if they can't find work, then<BR>
&gt; something, somehow needs to be done about it. Now, I come from a pure<BR>
&gt; libertarian and even objectivist background. Saying these things rankles<BR>
&gt; against a lot of my own former pet beliefs.&nbsp; But I don't see any holes<BR>
&gt; in the logic sufficient to make the problem just go away.<BR>
<BR>
That's great, but you totally forgot to answer my question.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;Government subsidies backed by<BR>
&gt; &gt; a massive tax and spend program? I'm sorry, but the world (at least pre-<BR>
&gt; &gt; Singularity) is not perfect. If someone can't learn what they need to<BR>
&gt; &gt; learn to get a &quot;good&quot; job in the new economy, then they are going to<BR>
&gt; &gt; have to take whatever work they can get.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The way we currently do economics I would agree that this sort of<BR>
&gt; program doesn't work very well.&nbsp; But the entire basis for our current<BR>
&gt; economics, scarcity, is fast disappearing as we go forward toward<BR>
&gt; singularity.&nbsp; So I think there is room to rewrite the fundamental<BR>
&gt; equations and to design something that isn't just the same as some label<BR>
&gt; we have already suffered with.<BR>
<BR>
Ok, still no answer or specifics. If you really don't have an answer on<BR>
how to handle the theoretical increasing unemployment, then just say so.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical event. What would be your solution to the hypothetical problem?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Figure out as quickly as possible how to ensure all have a workable<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard of living including the prime necessities and room to grow from<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there regardless of whether we have a standard paying job for all of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; those people.&nbsp; As we get closer to nanotech and as technology advances<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; May I suggest you move to Sweden? I hear they have a 50%+ tax rate for<BR>
&gt; &gt; the productive individuals, and the highest percentge of leeches (oops,<BR>
&gt; &gt; I mean &quot;people without a standard paying job&quot;) in the world.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; It is easy to throw out this sort of response.&nbsp; It is more difficult to<BR>
&gt; think about how to address the problem, if indeed there is one.<BR>
<BR>
I'm waiting for your ideas...<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we become better able to produce all the necessities and many of the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wants for everyone with increasingly less human labor involved.&nbsp; I don't<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think I need to quote studies for that point to be pretty obvious.&nbsp; If<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Well it isn't obvious to me why penalizing (through higher taxes) the people<BR>
&gt; &gt; who actually go through the trouble to learn how to work in the new economy<BR>
&gt; &gt; in order to support the losers is such a good idea.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I never once said that higher taxes are the way to address the problem.<BR>
&gt; I don't think they are.&nbsp; I don't know, honestly, what the answer is or<BR>
&gt; looks like.&nbsp; But I think it is high time we started to think quite<BR>
&gt; seriously about whether the current economic model is reasonable to<BR>
&gt; carry forward or if we should design something new to meet the<BR>
&gt; increasingly quite different economic context.<BR>
<BR>
Well I have absolutely failed to convince you that we don't need to worry.<BR>
So let's go into the theoretical direction of an unemployment problem,<BR>
and let's assume it is so bad that it affects progress towards Singularity<BR>
significantly. If none of us has ideas on how to handle that scenario, then<BR>
what are we left to discuss?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that is so then it is logical that we find ways to distribute these<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; goods and services that are less dependent on the recipients being<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; employed producing them.&nbsp; As we go forward we should be able to acheive<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; greater human freedom rather than following the same &quot;wage-slave&quot; model<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that developed in a very different past than the present, much less the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; near future.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; That sounds nice, but can specifically describe your future scenario<BR>
&gt; &gt; showing me how all this is going to work?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; P.S. you do realize that your average person who can't get a job tends to<BR>
&gt; &gt; get depressed and unhappy? They want something to do, and if watching TV<BR>
&gt; &gt; is all they have, they tend to head off sometimes into self-destructive<BR>
&gt; &gt; behaviors. If we rush to put 50% of our workforce out of work just &quot;because<BR>
&gt; &gt; we can&quot; and we &quot;want to increase happiness&quot;, we may the exact opposite<BR>
&gt; &gt; effect for many people.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; If, just as a for instance I don't know how to get to, if every person<BR>
&gt; had a decent living wage and all the physical necessities taken care of<BR>
&gt; (a la cheap nano-tech matter assemblers for instance), then every person<BR>
&gt; can be quite busily employed - doing exactly what they themselves find<BR>
&gt; most meaningful and interesting regardless of whether they are getting a<BR>
&gt; conventional paycheck for it.&nbsp; Personally I would have a hell of a lot<BR>
&gt; more to do than watching TV if I no longer had to work for someone else<BR>
&gt; for a living.&nbsp; I have more things to do and explore and work on than I<BR>
&gt; could finish in a hundred lifetimes of such 'pointless empty leisure'.<BR>
<BR>
It just doesn't make sense to me- ok let's take an extreme case to make<BR>
my point: let's say some guy has a dream: to fly airplanes. You can give<BR>
him his standard dole, but that isn't going to do anything in the least<BR>
to get him anywhere near his dream. So I simply don't buy your claim that<BR>
by giving everyone a bit of cash each month they are all going to be<BR>
perfectly happy. I will hold to my claim that the more people on the dole,<BR>
the more general unhappiness you will have.<BR>
<BR>
The only time you will achieve what you really want is when everyone who<BR>
wants to is uploaded into an environment that truly allows people to be<BR>
able to accomplish whatever they can think of. It simply is not going to<BR>
happen on this planet in our current state of affairs.<BR>
<BR>
Going on that fact, along with the fact that 150k+ people are dying each<BR>
day we sit around twiddling our thumbs, it makes the most sense from my<BR>
perspective to focus all our energies on getting to the Singularity ASAP.<BR>
I am only interested in this unemployment issue so far as it might affect<BR>
that goal.<BR>
