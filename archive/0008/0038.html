Al Gore during his acceptance speech tonight sent me a couple of unintended <BR>
messages as he contributed his share to the Democrats' parade of victimized <BR>
Americans.<BR>
<BR>
Around 19:10 PST he pointed out an elderly woman in the audience whose only <BR>
income came from Social Security, and who had to spend half of this income <BR>
on medications while the evil pharmaceutical companies are allegedly making <BR>
&quot;record profits.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Two things:<BR>
<BR>
One, this woman didn't plan her life very well. (In fact, she reminds me of <BR>
my grandparents, who I could tell even as a child were improvident and thus <BR>
POOR in their old age.)&nbsp; Nothing kept her from saving and investing in <BR>
equities or in real estate or in SOMETHING during her working life so that <BR>
she would have an independent wealth base and a stream of investment income <BR>
in addition to Social Security.&nbsp; Gore could have used an anonymous example <BR>
of that sort to emphasize the importance of assuming responsiblity for one's <BR>
well-being in retirement, though that would of course go against the state <BR>
patronage-seeking philosophy of his party.<BR>
<BR>
Two, the lesson for us younger people seems to be that we should buy shares <BR>
in these pharmaceutical companies now so that we can get their profitability <BR>
working in our favor as we build up the wealth base necessary to pay for the <BR>
radically more effective nanotech-, genomics- and stem cell-based <BR>
medications and therapies in the coming decades.&nbsp; Unless, that is, Gore wins <BR>
the election and does something to screw the pharmaceutical companies out of <BR>
the rewards for the considerable entrepreneurial risks they are taking.<BR>
<BR>
Trans-millennially yours,<BR>
