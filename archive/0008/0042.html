&gt; &gt; &gt; have been replaced or are simply not needed for production?&nbsp; I rather<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doubt it.&nbsp; The higher incomes of the upper middleclass are being eaten<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; up in competition for prime real estate and high pressure sales of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; consumer goods &quot;to keep the economy going&quot;.&nbsp; I very much doubt any but<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the quite rich have much money for hiring fulltime servants at a living<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wage.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Well correct me if I'm wrong, but you live in or near Silicon Valley,<BR>
&gt; &gt; right? Your perspective on the pricing of real estate and other things<BR>
&gt; &gt; might be a little warped :-)<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; That is irrelevant to this discussion.&nbsp; In very short order, if most of<BR>
&gt; our ideas/notions are correct, most places will make Silicon Valley look<BR>
&gt; like a sleepy backwater.&nbsp; Silicon Valley like effects are right now<BR>
&gt; beginning to hit many areas of the country.&nbsp; If you check the average<BR>
&gt; buying power of most of the middle class right through all but the top<BR>
&gt; of upper middle class, you will see that very little unemployment slack<BR>
&gt; will/can be taken up by hiring servants.&nbsp; And of course there is the<BR>
&gt; small truth that most people are not cut out to be servants.<BR>
<BR>
Not cut out for it? I don't buy that; I myself worked in some service-<BR>
type jobs when I was a teen. Anyone can work those jobs if they can't<BR>
find anything else to do. And as for costs for the middle class, I don't<BR>
buy that either. If you want to quote me something showing they have less<BR>
spendable income I would like to see it. As far as most people in this<BR>
country are concerned, this is the best they've ever had it. I myself<BR>
live in Atlanta which also is experiencing a real estate and population<BR>
boom, but we have the option here of growing out into the suburbs. I<BR>
would argue that such places as San Francisco and NYC are artificially<BR>
limited by geography, and therefore have no way for the middle class to<BR>
survive there long term.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, we'll see about all this as time<BR>
&gt; &gt; goes by. The middle class may not get back to the level of service they<BR>
&gt; &gt; enjoyed in the 1800s, but they already make enough money to use many of<BR>
&gt; &gt; the new services that are becoming available. They may not have full<BR>
&gt; &gt; time servants, but they will still provide more and more jobs in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; service areas.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Not enough by far.&nbsp; This is not the 1800s and trying to use that as a<BR>
<BR>
I didn't say it was the 1800s<BR>
<BR>
&gt; fit or even suggestive analogy is pointless.&nbsp; At some point and perhaps<BR>
&gt; already we must deal with the problem of human beings who are<BR>
&gt; unemployable and unneeded in the hyper-technological economy.&nbsp; That is,<BR>
&gt; we must if we care about human beings at all and are actually able to do<BR>
&gt; anything about the problem.&nbsp; We can, of course, assume this happens only<BR>
&gt; to Them and will not happen to Us as we are so bright and well-fortuned<BR>
&gt; and so on.&nbsp; But that is a very self-centered attitude that fully<BR>
&gt; justifies and can expect quite a bit of backlash.&nbsp; It also paints a<BR>
<BR>
Well I think you should break your response into two different subjects<BR>
when you respond. One for discussing whether or not we actually will<BR>
have an unemployment problem, and the other for what to do about such a<BR>
theoretical event. What would be your solution to the hypothetical problem?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; pretty dismal picture for what we can expect from the hyper-intelligent<BR>
&gt; AIs if they come on the scene if we assume that such an attitude is the<BR>
&gt; most logical and intelligent way of dealing with such problems.&nbsp; By the<BR>
&gt; same logic they will simply ignore us and use most/all of their<BR>
&gt; resources only for themselves.&nbsp; The result will be our extinction.<BR>
<BR>
Well you just made this up, and I'm not sure why. If we have hyper-<BR>
intelligent AIs then this whole argument is moot- that would be post-<BR>
Singularity and we really can't say for sure what it would be like.<BR>
Let's stay on the two topics.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just don't buy the argument that new tech will cause a massive rise in<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unemployment-<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why not?&nbsp; It is quite logical that over time more and more jobs can be<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; done more economically by automation and AIs.&nbsp; As this happens people<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will not be employed in those positions.&nbsp; As the AIs probably will have<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; no need of lackeys the slack will certainly not be taken up that way.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Again I say that the people displaced will be able to find jobs in other<BR>
&gt; &gt; areas. I also don't see that many jobs being displaced as you might think.<BR>
&gt; &gt; Companies here with large factory forces (think car makers for instance)<BR>
&gt; &gt; will probably never fully automate their production. As for AI, it will<BR>
&gt; &gt; likely stay pretty limited in its application- it will not be capable of<BR>
&gt; &gt; human-level thinking until very near the Singularity. Can you point out<BR>
&gt; &gt; some specific types of jobs that will simply go *poof* and displace millions<BR>
&gt; &gt; of workers?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Your contention is simply an assertion and one that is increasingly<BR>
&gt; unlikely as the technological basis of all economic activity becomes<BR>
&gt; increasingly advanced and automated.&nbsp; In the not unimaginable near<BR>
<BR>
Really? So far your contention is also an assertion, and based on our<BR>
experience of the last 100 years (which I also consider to be part of<BR>
the run-up to Singularity) you would be wrong. So by Occam's Razor can<BR>
we also guess that I may be right, and that our economic progress and<BR>
low unemployment rate will continue? You on the other hand sound like<BR>
some of the people around 1900 who were so worried about the age of<BR>
machinery. (to be blunt)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; future un-augmented human beings will not even be able to compete in the<BR>
&gt; intellectual white-collar areas of the market.&nbsp; With what are the<BR>
&gt; unemployed and unemployable to obtain such augmentation?&nbsp; In some areas<BR>
<BR>
Umm, well you do you live in the Valley, you should know that the companies<BR>
there will do pretty much anything to get employees. In fact today we<BR>
already have companies like Ford and Delta giving away computers to their<BR>
employees. I think it is obvious that future companies will give their<BR>
employees whatever tech and augmentation is required. So bzzt on your<BR>
suggestion that tech will put info workers out of work.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; of intellectual work you don't even need human level AI to replace human<BR>
&gt; workers.&nbsp; You simply need computers designed/programmed for focusing<BR>
&gt; deeply on the delimited problem at hand to the extent they are superior<BR>
&gt; in cost/benefit to the humans who formerly performed that function.<BR>
<BR>
Can you be more specific as to exactly what jobs here you are referring to?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Car companies in the states at least are blocked from full automation by<BR>
&gt; unions.&nbsp; But this situation is quite temporary.&nbsp; Much of the<BR>
&gt; manufacturing jobs in the US already have either been automated or are<BR>
&gt; now filled where the labor pool is cheaper.<BR>
<BR>
Unlikely, since car companies and by extension their parts suppliers have<BR>
a vested interest in producing &quot;made in america&quot; cars. Even foreign car<BR>
companies like Honda, Mercedes, and BMW produce cars here in order to<BR>
get that distinction.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I asked you to point out where all these millions and millions of<BR>
jobs you claim will disappear will happen, so far I don't see it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in fact our current unemployment is at record lows- 4%.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Our current official unemployment is at a record low.&nbsp; Although a lot of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unemployed people are not counted in coming up with that number.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Who cares if it is totally accurate, but to my knowledge it has been<BR>
&gt; &gt; calculated the same way forever, or at least a long time; and during that<BR>
&gt; &gt; time it is now at an all time low.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Who cares?&nbsp; Anyone that cares to really mark the trends and cares about<BR>
&gt; the human beings being left by the wayside and cares what that may<BR>
&gt; portent.&nbsp;&nbsp; How the numbers are calculated, afaik, has been changed many<BR>
&gt; times since the sixties.&nbsp; Pointing to this one indicator still does<BR>
&gt; nothing to address what looks to me like an inescapable problem as we go<BR>
&gt; forward.<BR>
<BR>
Sure it does, it shows that at least since the last time the indicator<BR>
was changed, our unemployment is at a record low. Any yet by your reasoning<BR>
we should already be deeply into unemployment issues since our infotech<BR>
revolution has been going on for over 30 years. When exactly do you see the<BR>
big jobs collapse occuring?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Did<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you read the sci-fi book The Diamond Age? Our society might move towards<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some kind of neo-victorian mode before the Singularity wraps things up.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And what will this wrapping up be like in your view?&nbsp; Do you think human<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; displacement will only occur during full-bore singularity or will some<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of it take place along the way to getting there?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Oh, when I say wrapping up I mean the Singularity itself- i.e. technology<BR>
&gt; &gt; suddenly (probably due to a real AI finally waking up) begins changing at<BR>
&gt; &gt; a near infinite speed, and within a very short time life as we know it is<BR>
&gt; &gt; over with (unless you want to stay in a human body on this planet, in that<BR>
&gt; &gt; case I'm sure the AI will let you do that). Read Diaspora by Greg Egan if<BR>
&gt; &gt; you haven't- I'm taking about an Introdus.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I have read most of those books.&nbsp; But my question is, how will we treat<BR>
<BR>
Did you read Diaspora?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; one another, what is the proper way to treat one another morally, as we<BR>
&gt; become more and more advanced?&nbsp; Is there a way of making sure as many as<BR>
&gt; possible win?&nbsp; Is that way global capitalism, or current mixtures, or<BR>
<BR>
Yes, by accelerating the Singularity (but hey, I'm biased :-)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; something yet to be found and implemented? Is it actually critical to<BR>
&gt; our success in reaching the singularity and to the maximum efficiency of<BR>
<BR>
I think this subject is important because yes it is important in terms<BR>
of reaching the Singularity that we maintain at a minimum our rate of<BR>
tech development and society stability.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; any post-singularity society of whatever types of intelligences that all<BR>
&gt; individualities are cared for enough to maximize their abilities and<BR>
&gt; outputs (sort of a la STNG)?&nbsp; Or do we believe that endless competition<BR>
&gt; (which seems to me to be more of a scarcity game) is the only or most<BR>
&gt; intelligent play that we can/should expect going toward (and hopefully<BR>
&gt; through) the Singularity?<BR>
<BR>
No, we (I mean SIAI here) believe that there should be some amount of<BR>
resources guaranteed to everyone post-Singularity. Things should start<BR>
out equal. If you look over at the archives of the FoRK list (www.xent.com)<BR>
there was a debate between Eliezer and some other people on just this<BR>
subject a couple of days ago.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; Lastly let me lay out my timeline, I place the Singularity no later than<BR>
&gt; &gt; 2020. From now till then I don't see massive unemployment, due to the fact<BR>
&gt; &gt; that service jobs and technology jobs will continue to increase, and the<BR>
&gt; &gt; only automation will continue to be in areas where there are no strong<BR>
&gt; &gt; unions, and jobs are simple enough to be done by dumb machines.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; You can't get there from here.&nbsp; There must be ever increasing machine<BR>
&gt; intelligence and automation all along the path if we are to reach 2020.<BR>
<BR>
I disagree, the only thing that we (SIAI again) need to get our Singularity<BR>
done is a certain base level of computational power (which we will probably<BR>
have no later than 2010, and which does not require any form of AI to<BR>
develop), and the programmers and other scientists to develop the code<BR>
to run on it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; One or two advances in computational density without advances in<BR>
&gt; software and other areas (for instance) will not get us there.&nbsp; It is a<BR>
&gt; continuous curve (more or less) up to that point.&nbsp; The above doesn't<BR>
&gt; seem to acknowledge points that I believe are inevitable along the way.<BR>
&gt; We will see many service jobs (I think Moravec mentioned fast food<BR>
&gt; workers once) disappear along the way.&nbsp; We will see levels of home<BR>
&gt; automation and new products that make personal servants much less<BR>
&gt; likely.&nbsp; We will see the unions cracked open (already happening) as they<BR>
&gt; become increasingly a drag on hyper-production.&nbsp; The machines will and<BR>
&gt; must become ever increasingly less dumb if we are ever to arrive at<BR>
&gt; singularity.<BR>
<BR>
I think you're right that the curve will continue heading up (even though<BR>
we don't need all of it), but on the other hand I still don't buy your<BR>
argument of an unemployment disaster. Who is going to design, build, sell,<BR>
install, and maintain all these wonderful new toys? The more toys we<BR>
invent, the more jobs there will be created. Even if some services do<BR>
eventually lose jobs, I don't see the collapse you are predicting. I'll<BR>
have to go see if I can find any kind of academic works to back up my<BR>
assertion, or perhaps someone on the list has something to say.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;As the<BR>
&gt; &gt; citizens of the world get gradually richer, demand for these services and<BR>
&gt; &gt; luxury products will continue to rise, creating jobs in service and artisan<BR>
&gt; &gt; areas. Etc. etc.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; If we continue with the current model then fewer and fewer people will<BR>
&gt; get rich enough relatively to hire the others and fewer of them will<BR>
<BR>
Whaaa? We have more millionaires here in the US than at any other time.<BR>
All I see is more and more people making more and more money.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; need/want human beings to perform tasks that can be more efficiently<BR>
&gt; handled by automation.&nbsp; The residue of things that only humans can do<BR>
&gt; will shrink over time.&nbsp; I see no way current competition based (and<BR>
<BR>
It will very slowly shrink, I would predict along the same lines as the<BR>
Singularity itself proceeds.. there will be a slow growth in the types<BR>
of things not done by humans, until just before the Singularity at which<BR>
point many things will no longer need to be done by humans (although they<BR>
still might want to do them!). But just because some tasks continue to<BR>
be automated does not imply an unemployment disaster. Think about how<BR>
many tasks have already been automated since 1900, yet we have no problem<BR>
finding jobs for practically everyone?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; actually scarcity based) economic models can continue to run going<BR>
&gt; forward without displacing and disowning more and more people.&nbsp; I would<BR>
&gt; very much like to see it differently.<BR>
<BR>
Well we see an example of this here with MP3s/Napster/etc. It remains to<BR>
be completely resolved, but most people seem to think that the artists<BR>
will still be able to make a living even after the scarcity of the data<BR>
distribution is gone. The issue comes down to human creativity I guess-<BR>
/that/ will still be scarce until such time as we have full strong AI,<BR>
and at that point we will have the Singularity.<BR>
