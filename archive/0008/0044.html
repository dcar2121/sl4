&gt; &gt; &gt; That is irrelevant to this discussion.&nbsp; In very short order, if most of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our ideas/notions are correct, most places will make Silicon Valley look<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a sleepy backwater.&nbsp; Silicon Valley like effects are right now<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning to hit many areas of the country.&nbsp; If you check the average<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; buying power of most of the middle class right through all but the top<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of upper middle class, you will see that very little unemployment slack<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will/can be taken up by hiring servants.&nbsp; And of course there is the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; small truth that most people are not cut out to be servants.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Not cut out for it? I don't buy that; I myself worked in some service-<BR>
&gt; &gt; type jobs when I was a teen. Anyone can work those jobs if they can't<BR>
&gt; &gt; find anything else to do.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I disagree on two counts.&nbsp; One, we should be able to employ our growing<BR>
&gt; wealth and abilities to enable people to do what most suits them and<BR>
&gt; most optimizes their personalities and talents, not simply whatever<BR>
&gt; someone will pay for.&nbsp; People were meant to be a bit more than salary<BR>
<BR>
&quot;meant&quot;? Are you implying some kind of creator?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; whores imho.&nbsp; I don't think it serves us well to not optimize for each<BR>
&gt; person contributing what they do best regardless of whether we have a<BR>
&gt; job open for it that pays in the conventional sense or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; What you<BR>
&gt; would/could put up with as a teen and what a highly trained but<BR>
&gt; currently unemployable physicist can/should put up with are very<BR>
&gt; different.<BR>
<BR>
Sounds like what the communists wanted/promised. It sure isn't ultra-<BR>
capitalism as I know it. How exactly would the jobs be provided for the<BR>
&quot;worthy&quot; if no one wants to hire them? Government subsidies backed by<BR>
a massive tax and spend program? I'm sorry, but the world (at least pre-<BR>
Singularity) is not perfect. If someone can't learn what they need to<BR>
learn to get a &quot;good&quot; job in the new economy, then they are going to<BR>
have to take whatever work they can get.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Second, I disagree that everyone can do well whatever they decide to do.<BR>
<BR>
Where did I say that? All I said was that they could do it- not that they<BR>
would love it, or be excellent at it.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;And as for costs for the middle class, I don't<BR>
&gt; &gt; buy that either. If you want to quote me something showing they have less<BR>
&gt; &gt; spendable income I would like to see it. As far as most people in this<BR>
&gt; &gt; country are concerned, this is the best they've ever had it. I myself<BR>
&gt; &gt; live in Atlanta which also is experiencing a real estate and population<BR>
&gt; &gt; boom, but we have the option here of growing out into the suburbs. I<BR>
&gt; &gt; would argue that such places as San Francisco and NYC are artificially<BR>
&gt; &gt; limited by geography, and therefore have no way for the middle class to<BR>
&gt; &gt; survive there long term.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I don't have quotes at hand for you of the actual lower buying power in<BR>
&gt; some critical areas like housing that the middleclass has today.&nbsp; Those<BR>
&gt; studies exist.&nbsp; I simply don't have the time to look them up right now.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a brief blurb about burgeoning middle class buying power in asia:<BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/story/76.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/story/76.html</a><BR>
<BR>
Here is a blurb supporting the idea that the middle class is getting<BR>
shafted in the new economy- productivity gains are not leading to massive<BR>
increases in pay:<BR>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.epinet.org/webfeatures/viewpoints/laborday%2099.html">http://www.epinet.org/webfeatures/viewpoints/laborday%2099.html</a><BR>
<BR>
I will buy that argument, but note it does show that they did experience<BR>
SOME (albeit small) growth in wages over the last 10 years. Also note that<BR>
inflation in general has been abnormally low during that period. At any<BR>
rate I don't know why we are discussing buying power since it is off-<BR>
topic. We should be talking about unemployment, not the excellent efficiency<BR>
of our current economy.<BR>
<BR>
Finally keep in mind as I said, quite a lot of people in the last 10 years<BR>
escaped the middle class to go higher. Just because the middle class is<BR>
getting shafted doesn't mean that a lot of them are getting rich.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, we'll see about all this as time<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goes by. The middle class may not get back to the level of service they<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoyed in the 1800s, but they already make enough money to use many of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the new services that are becoming available. They may not have full<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time servants, but they will still provide more and more jobs in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; service areas.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not enough by far.&nbsp; This is not the 1800s and trying to use that as a<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I didn't say it was the 1800s<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; No, you simply used it to mark your point.&nbsp; It isn't very good for that<BR>
&gt; purpose.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fit or even suggestive analogy is pointless.&nbsp; At some point and perhaps<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; already we must deal with the problem of human beings who are<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unemployable and unneeded in the hyper-technological economy.&nbsp; That is,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we must if we care about human beings at all and are actually able to do<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything about the problem.&nbsp; We can, of course, assume this happens only<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to Them and will not happen to Us as we are so bright and well-fortuned<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and so on.&nbsp; But that is a very self-centered attitude that fully<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; justifies and can expect quite a bit of backlash.&nbsp; It also paints a<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Well I think you should break your response into two different subjects<BR>
&gt; &gt; when you respond. One for discussing whether or not we actually will<BR>
&gt; &gt; have an unemployment problem, and the other for what to do about such a<BR>
&gt; &gt; theoretical event. What would be your solution to the hypothetical problem?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Figure out as quickly as possible how to ensure all have a workable<BR>
&gt; standard of living including the prime necessities and room to grow from<BR>
&gt; there regardless of whether we have a standard paying job for all of<BR>
&gt; those people.&nbsp; As we get closer to nanotech and as technology advances<BR>
<BR>
May I suggest you move to Sweden? I hear they have a 50%+ tax rate for<BR>
the productive individuals, and the highest percentge of leeches (oops,<BR>
I mean &quot;people without a standard paying job&quot;) in the world.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; we become better able to produce all the necessities and many of the<BR>
&gt; wants for everyone with increasingly less human labor involved.&nbsp; I don't<BR>
&gt; think I need to quote studies for that point to be pretty obvious.&nbsp; If<BR>
<BR>
Well it isn't obvious to me why penalizing (through higher taxes) the people<BR>
who actually go through the trouble to learn how to work in the new economy<BR>
in order to support the losers is such a good idea.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; that is so then it is logical that we find ways to distribute these<BR>
&gt; goods and services that are less dependent on the recipients being<BR>
&gt; employed producing them.&nbsp; As we go forward we should be able to acheive<BR>
&gt; greater human freedom rather than following the same &quot;wage-slave&quot; model<BR>
&gt; that developed in a very different past than the present, much less the<BR>
&gt; near future.<BR>
<BR>
That sounds nice, but can specifically describe your future scenario<BR>
showing me how all this is going to work?<BR>
<BR>
P.S. you do realize that your average person who can't get a job tends to<BR>
get depressed and unhappy? They want something to do, and if watching TV<BR>
is all they have, they tend to head off sometimes into self-destructive<BR>
behaviors. If we rush to put 50% of our workforce out of work just &quot;because<BR>
we can&quot; and we &quot;want to increase happiness&quot;, we may the exact opposite<BR>
effect for many people.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pretty dismal picture for what we can expect from the hyper-intelligent<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; AIs if they come on the scene if we assume that such an attitude is the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most logical and intelligent way of dealing with such problems.&nbsp; By the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; same logic they will simply ignore us and use most/all of their<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resources only for themselves.&nbsp; The result will be our extinction.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Well you just made this up, and I'm not sure why. If we have hyper-<BR>
&gt; &gt; intelligent AIs then this whole argument is moot- that would be post-<BR>
&gt; &gt; Singularity and we really can't say for sure what it would be like.<BR>
&gt; &gt; Let's stay on the two topics.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; No.&nbsp; I did not make it up.&nbsp; It has been said on this list that those who<BR>
&gt; aren't making it are to blame for their condition and that anyone who<BR>
&gt; wants to make it can.&nbsp; It has been suggested that people can slot<BR>
&gt; themselves into whatever jobs are paying money and that thus there is no<BR>
&gt; problem.&nbsp; If the AIs take this attitude and have no real use for us at<BR>
&gt; all or a use that is distasteful and wasteful of human abilities and<BR>
&gt; lives then we will not have a very happy ending to our long rise from<BR>
&gt; the cave.&nbsp; It is not just one or two topics. These issues are quite<BR>
&gt; throughly inter-related and entangled.<BR>
<BR>
Well now you are heading off into a completely unrelated third subject:<BR>
will AIs eat us all. I am having trouble keeping this conversation going<BR>
if we are going to keep branching. I again suggest when you reply that<BR>
you create multiple new subject lines each addressing your points:<BR>
<BR>
 AIs may eat us all<BR>
<BR>
 As singularity approaches it will create massive unemployment<BR>
<BR>
 Suggestions on how to handle theoretical singularity-caused unemployment<BR>
<BR>
Not only will that make this all easier to read, you might get some other<BR>
people jumping in on specific topics.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; The argument is not moot because, hopefully, we can manage to get to the<BR>
&gt; singularity with some confidence and buy-in that we are actually headed<BR>
&gt; for an improved reality rather than simply our demise.&nbsp; Not many people<BR>
&gt; are going to buy in on a hyper technological pig-in-the-poke that might<BR>
&gt; produce heaven on earth and then again it might wipe earth and all of us<BR>
&gt; out of existence before it really figures out what it is and what it<BR>
&gt; wants.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can't figure out what our right relationship is to other<BR>
&gt; human beings then it is pretty unlikely we can expect AIs to figure it<BR>
&gt; out or especially to come to a relationship with us that we can expect<BR>
&gt; to be at all benevolent.<BR>
<BR>
Well the fact is, unless the government comes and arrests us all I don't<BR>
see the people being able to stop our research. We (SIAI here) have spent<BR>
a great deal of time thinking over the alternatives such as:<BR>
<BR>
 let's wait for nanotech (planet wipe-out more likely due to human error or<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; terrorism)<BR>
<BR>
 let's wait for uploading (first human uploads probably take over the planet)<BR>
<BR>
 let's take the Bill Joy approach and stop (very very bad, 150k people dying<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; every day we don't reach the Singularity! slow down is bad news)<BR>
<BR>
and come to the conclusion that creating a Singularity ASAP is the best<BR>
possible choice. It's true that we can't fully cover all the risks in<BR>
developing a real, intelligence-enhancing AI mainly because we aren't smart<BR>
enough to know what a super-intelligence will do! On the other hand I think<BR>
you've watched The Matrix too many times- a SI AI will likely have little<BR>
to no use for us humans, just as we have no real use for ants. It may go<BR>
jetting off into the universe and not do didly squat for us. We HOPE it<BR>
will give something back in return for creating it.<BR>
<BR>
However using humans -&gt; ants as an analogy to SI AI -&gt; humans is a bad<BR>
example I have to stop using. A SI AI will be aware that we are intelligent,<BR>
and would not even consider treating us like we treat ants. It would not<BR>
consider eating us or our planet unless it was completely insane- and that<BR>
is a factor that is completely under our control as we design, build, and<BR>
hopefully test the seed AI.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your contention is simply an assertion and one that is increasingly<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unlikely as the technological basis of all economic activity becomes<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; increasingly advanced and automated.&nbsp; In the not unimaginable near<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Really? So far your contention is also an assertion, and based on our<BR>
&gt; &gt; experience of the last 100 years (which I also consider to be part of<BR>
&gt; &gt; the run-up to Singularity) you would be wrong. So by Occam's Razor can<BR>
&gt; &gt; we also guess that I may be right, and that our economic progress and<BR>
&gt; &gt; low unemployment rate will continue? You on the other hand sound like<BR>
&gt; &gt; some of the people around 1900 who were so worried about the age of<BR>
&gt; &gt; machinery. (to be blunt)<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Yes, but I've tried (as you have) to back up the contention with<BR>
&gt; reasonable argument that you have not addressed adequately imho.&nbsp;&nbsp; We<BR>
<BR>
I have pointed out above that over the last 100+ years things have only<BR>
gotten better employment-wise as tech has developed. You have not pointed<BR>
out a single fact showing an increase in unemployment now, or showing why<BR>
we will have an unemployment problem in the future.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; are not facing something that looks like the last 100 years that much<BR>
&gt; unless you condense that amount of change at least 10-fold (this year).<BR>
<BR>
Ok, but on the other hand if you agree with me that the last 10 years<BR>
during which our economy has done so well was also not like the previous<BR>
90 years, then my argument holds. You have not given any proof that the<BR>
workers in our country will not be able to deal with increasing rates<BR>
of change. In fact many of them seem to thrive on it!<BR>
<BR>
Not only that, but if you do make the claim that there is a certain level<BR>
of rate of change that workers can't deal with, then I can use that to<BR>
say that the runup to Singularity will level off at that rate until we<BR>
develop enhanced intelligence. i.e. the economy will self-regulate itself<BR>
to sustain only the maximum rate of change that the workers can deal with.<BR>
So what are you worrying about?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; Even to take that example, how many different economic forces and<BR>
&gt; dislocations of workers and economies have occurred in that time?&nbsp; Do<BR>
&gt; you notice that this post-industrial problem was first identified in the<BR>
&gt; 1950s (by Galbraith I believe)?&nbsp; Did you not notice that the US and most<BR>
&gt; western countries introduced massive welfare programs to attempt to take<BR>
&gt; up some of the slack of people not just naturally being reasonably ok<BR>
&gt; due to working in the economy?<BR>
<BR>
Sure I noticed- I also noticed an article I read in the paper a couple of<BR>
weeks back that pointed out we are now at record lows in many states<BR>
regarding the number of people on said welfare. I just don't see the<BR>
doomsday you are pointing at for all these workers.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Occam's razor is not applicable in your above argument.&nbsp; Your theories<BR>
&gt; are not simpler and even if they are that is not an argument that they<BR>
&gt; are more correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; Insulting me by implying I am a Luddite is<BR>
&gt; especially foolish.&nbsp; I am quite the opposite.&nbsp; But I refuse to assume<BR>
&gt; just because we are exhibiting higher technology that that will<BR>
&gt; automatically result in a better world.&nbsp; Do not confuse an attempt to<BR>
&gt; envision how to get from here to there with the least pain and the best<BR>
&gt; result with a claim that we shouldn't go there at all.<BR>
<BR>
Ok, but I don't see your version of the interim meaning of life. I don't<BR>
see your masterplan. Is it on a webpage somewhere? What do you think<BR>
exactly is the best plan to use over the next 10 to 20 years pre-Singularity?<BR>
Lay it all out for us in detail.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; future un-augmented human beings will not even be able to compete in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; intellectual white-collar areas of the market.&nbsp; With what are the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unemployed and unemployable to obtain such augmentation?&nbsp; In some areas<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Umm, well you do you live in the Valley, you should know that the companies<BR>
&gt; &gt; there will do pretty much anything to get employees. In fact today we<BR>
&gt; &gt; already have companies like Ford and Delta giving away computers to their<BR>
&gt; &gt; employees. I think it is obvious that future companies will give their<BR>
&gt; &gt; employees whatever tech and augmentation is required. So bzzt on your<BR>
&gt; &gt; suggestion that tech will put info workers out of work.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; That does not follow.&nbsp; Please keep rude noises to yourself.<BR>
<BR>
That was not a response. Do you have a real response to my claim that the<BR>
companies will keep their employees upgraded with whatever they need to<BR>
work?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of intellectual work you don't even need human level AI to replace human<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; workers.&nbsp; You simply need computers designed/programmed for focusing<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply on the delimited problem at hand to the extent they are superior<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in cost/benefit to the humans who formerly performed that function.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Can you be more specific as to exactly what jobs here you are referring to?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Specifics are not terribly relevant when attempting to point out the<BR>
&gt; obvious.<BR>
<BR>
Another no-response. How can we have a debate without specifics? Just one<BR>
or two is all I ask.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Car companies in the states at least are blocked from full automation by<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unions.&nbsp; But this situation is quite temporary.&nbsp; Much of the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; manufacturing jobs in the US already have either been automated or are<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; now filled where the labor pool is cheaper.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Unlikely, since car companies and by extension their parts suppliers have<BR>
&gt; &gt; a vested interest in producing &quot;made in america&quot; cars. Even foreign car<BR>
&gt; &gt; companies like Honda, Mercedes, and BMW produce cars here in order to<BR>
&gt; &gt; get that distinction.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think you missed a lot of recent history.&nbsp; &quot;Made in America&quot; is no<BR>
&gt; longer considered a good thing when it comes to cars.&nbsp; It hasn't been<BR>
&gt; for some time.<BR>
<BR>
Well I was pointing out recent history: foreign car makers very recently<BR>
(last 3 years for BMW/Mercedes) opening new factories here in the US. And<BR>
I have a hard time coming up with news articles pointing out large factory<BR>
closures by the Big 3 automakers in the US. You whole argument is based on<BR>
things you forsee happening in the future, but there doesn't seem to be<BR>
much you can point at to back it all up.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Who cares?&nbsp; Anyone that cares to really mark the trends and cares about<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the human beings being left by the wayside and cares what that may<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; portent.&nbsp;&nbsp; How the numbers are calculated, afaik, has been changed many<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; times since the sixties.&nbsp; Pointing to this one indicator still does<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to address what looks to me like an inescapable problem as we go<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forward.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Sure it does, it shows that at least since the last time the indicator<BR>
&gt; &gt; was changed, our unemployment is at a record low. Any yet by your reasoning<BR>
&gt; &gt; we should already be deeply into unemployment issues since our infotech<BR>
&gt; &gt; revolution has been going on for over 30 years. When exactly do you see the<BR>
&gt; &gt; big jobs collapse occuring?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Are you ignoring how many people are on the dole here and in the other<BR>
&gt; Western nations?<BR>
<BR>
I just pointed out above that welfare recipients in many states are now<BR>
near all time lows. I can dig the actual articles up on this if you want?<BR>
As for other western nations (I guess you mean Europe) that is not<BR>
comparable to the US. The mess they have is their own political/social<BR>
making, and not due to technology. In fact, their lack of use of the<BR>
Internet and other technologies is holding them back!<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Did<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you read the sci-fi book The Diamond Age? Our society might move towards<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some kind of neo-victorian mode before the Singularity wraps things up.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what will this wrapping up be like in your view?&nbsp; Do you think human<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; displacement will only occur during full-bore singularity or will some<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of it take place along the way to getting there?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, when I say wrapping up I mean the Singularity itself- i.e. technology<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suddenly (probably due to a real AI finally waking up) begins changing at<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a near infinite speed, and within a very short time life as we know it is<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; over with (unless you want to stay in a human body on this planet, in that<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case I'm sure the AI will let you do that). Read Diaspora by Greg Egan if<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you haven't- I'm taking about an Introdus.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have read most of those books.&nbsp; But my question is, how will we treat<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Did you read Diaspora?<BR>
<BR>
Another no response. I take that as a no.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one another, what is the proper way to treat one another morally, as we<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; become more and more advanced?&nbsp; Is there a way of making sure as many as<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; possible win?&nbsp; Is that way global capitalism, or current mixtures, or<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Yes, by accelerating the Singularity (but hey, I'm biased :-)<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something yet to be found and implemented? Is it actually critical to<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our success in reaching the singularity and to the maximum efficiency of<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I think this subject is important because yes it is important in terms<BR>
&gt; &gt; of reaching the Singularity that we maintain at a minimum our rate of<BR>
&gt; &gt; tech development and society stability.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Where will this stability come from if I am even moderately right and<BR>
&gt; more and more people feel disenfranchised from the society and more and<BR>
&gt; more uneasy with where it is going?&nbsp; You need buy-in as you go as much<BR>
&gt; as possible.&nbsp; Do you think that a society where half the population<BR>
&gt; believe in bogey-men (angels, demons, young earth and so on) and where<BR>
&gt; the average college graduate reads only one book after graduation in<BR>
&gt; their entire life is stable?&nbsp; Especially at a time of accelerating<BR>
&gt; technological change?&nbsp; Dunno.&nbsp; It looks to me like we aren't doing such<BR>
&gt; a bang-up job in a lot of areas that we can just congratulate ourselves<BR>
&gt; and call for more of the same.<BR>
<BR>
Well yes, if your employment-collapse theory happens that would BAD. We<BR>
are discussing that above, so I won't go into it here. What I will point<BR>
out, is that assuming our employment level remains ok, I don't see why<BR>
we will have a huge backlash pre-Singularity. Remember I talking by 2020<BR>
here. In that time span, there are two main scenarios I guess to consider:<BR>
no uber-nanotech, or real nanotech. Assuming no major nanotech-in-our-<BR>
daily-lives-ala-Diamond-Age then I don't think much will change for the<BR>
average person. They will have ever-faster computers, improvements in<BR>
their lifestyle/span due to biotech advances, and plenty of new toys to<BR>
keep them entertained. But there will not be any major life-changing<BR>
things going on. Things like the Singularity will seem to be far-out<BR>
schemes that likely won't be taken that seriously until near the very<BR>
end of the pre-Singularity era. In a world with nanotech it is a very<BR>
different story- that is really hard to guess what it might look like.<BR>
It might be tightly regulated so that it kind of slowly filters into<BR>
the lives of people. Or depending on how easy it is to do, it might<BR>
become very widespread like computers are today, allowing any joe<BR>
schmo to create stuff in vis basement. Scary thought.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming a no nanotech-everywhere scenario, what do think will people<BR>
find so shocking about the next 10-20 years?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; any post-singularity society of whatever types of intelligences that all<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; individualities are cared for enough to maximize their abilities and<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; outputs (sort of a la STNG)?&nbsp; Or do we believe that endless competition<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (which seems to me to be more of a scarcity game) is the only or most<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent play that we can/should expect going toward (and hopefully<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; through) the Singularity?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; No, we (I mean SIAI here) believe that there should be some amount of<BR>
&gt; &gt; resources guaranteed to everyone post-Singularity. Things should start<BR>
&gt; &gt; out equal. If you look over at the archives of the FoRK list (www.xent.com)<BR>
&gt; &gt; there was a debate between Eliezer and some other people on just this<BR>
&gt; &gt; subject a couple of days ago.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; OK.&nbsp; Something we at least in part agree on. :-)&nbsp; Although I think it<BR>
&gt; goes beyond simply starting out with equal resources if you wish to get<BR>
&gt; the maximum good from each being that they are capable of producing.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly let me lay out my timeline, I place the Singularity no later than<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2020. From now till then I don't see massive unemployment, due to the fact<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that service jobs and technology jobs will continue to increase, and the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only automation will continue to be in areas where there are no strong<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unions, and jobs are simple enough to be done by dumb machines.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You can't get there from here.&nbsp; There must be ever increasing machine<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligence and automation all along the path if we are to reach 2020.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I disagree, the only thing that we (SIAI again) need to get our Singularity<BR>
&gt; &gt; done is a certain base level of computational power (which we will probably<BR>
&gt; &gt; have no later than 2010, and which does not require any form of AI to<BR>
&gt; &gt; develop), and the programmers and other scientists to develop the code<BR>
&gt; &gt; to run on it.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; We wil&nbsp; have several years of increasing technology and its<BR>
&gt; ramifications on society to go through to get there.&nbsp; I don't think your<BR>
&gt; agreement or lack of same changes that.&nbsp; This software needed will not<BR>
&gt; spring full-grown out of nowhere any more than the computational power<BR>
&gt; will.<BR>
<BR>
We are working on the necessary software. That will come from us. The<BR>
hardware is the most important unknown for us, but it simply looks more<BR>
promising every day. We might have the needed horsepower as soon as the<BR>
late 00's.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One or two advances in computational density without advances in<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; software and other areas (for instance) will not get us there.&nbsp; It is a<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous curve (more or less) up to that point.&nbsp; The above doesn't<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to acknowledge points that I believe are inevitable along the way.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We will see many service jobs (I think Moravec mentioned fast food<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; workers once) disappear along the way.&nbsp; We will see levels of home<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; automation and new products that make personal servants much less<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; likely.&nbsp; We will see the unions cracked open (already happening) as they<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; become increasingly a drag on hyper-production.&nbsp; The machines will and<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; must become ever increasingly less dumb if we are ever to arrive at<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; singularity.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I think you're right that the curve will continue heading up (even though<BR>
&gt; &gt; we don't need all of it), but on the other hand I still don't buy your<BR>
&gt; &gt; argument of an unemployment disaster. Who is going to design, build, sell,<BR>
&gt; &gt; install, and maintain all these wonderful new toys? The more toys we<BR>
&gt; &gt; invent, the more jobs there will be created. Even if some services do<BR>
&gt; &gt; eventually lose jobs, I don't see the collapse you are predicting. I'll<BR>
&gt; &gt; have to go see if I can find any kind of academic works to back up my<BR>
&gt; &gt; assertion, or perhaps someone on the list has something to say.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; There will of course be engineers, scientists, marketing folk and so on<BR>
&gt; involved in producing and exploiting the coming advances.&nbsp; That<BR>
&gt; certainly does not say that everyone will be employed in the needed<BR>
&gt; capacities.&nbsp; I did not predict a collapse actually.&nbsp; I just predict a<BR>
&gt; growing problem that it is important for us to address well.<BR>
<BR>
Ahh ok, my bad. But if it is just a slowly growing issue over the next<BR>
couple of decades I am not too worried about it. Our government will<BR>
simply put them on the dole, end of story. No big worries there. We are<BR>
only worried about massive things that might slow down the development<BR>
of the needed computing hardware.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;As the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; citizens of the world get gradually richer, demand for these services and<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; luxury products will continue to rise, creating jobs in service and artisan<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; areas. Etc. etc.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If we continue with the current model then fewer and fewer people will<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get rich enough relatively to hire the others and fewer of them will<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Whaaa? We have more millionaires here in the US than at any other time.<BR>
&gt; &gt; All I see is more and more people making more and more money.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; We have more millionaires and the actual buying power of a million<BR>
&gt; dollars in considerably less than it was at mid century or even a few<BR>
&gt; decades ago.&nbsp; You can have wheelbarrows full of money and still have a<BR>
&gt; very lopsided distribution of wealth where only a few can hire that many<BR>
&gt; others (as you suggested would occur).<BR>
<BR>
Well in fact last I heard, the service side of our economy is still I<BR>
think the most rapidly growing in terms of number of jobs created.<BR>
All the middle class won't have their own servants, but they will continue<BR>
contributing to this increase in service jobs IMO.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; In some types of real wealth we are much better off.&nbsp; There are many<BR>
&gt; types of wealth now common (information technology based mostly) that<BR>
&gt; could not be had at any price before.&nbsp; But the effect of these great<BR>
&gt; liberators has not been as much liberation of human throught and<BR>
&gt; creativity as it should have been.<BR>
<BR>
Well we will just have to see how the whole intellectual property/Napster<BR>
thing works out won't we? I think you are a little early to say that<BR>
tech killed creativity.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; need/want human beings to perform tasks that can be more efficiently<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; handled by automation.&nbsp; The residue of things that only humans can do<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will shrink over time.&nbsp; I see no way current competition based (and<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; It will very slowly shrink, I would predict along the same lines as the<BR>
&gt; &gt; Singularity itself proceeds.. there will be a slow growth in the types<BR>
&gt; &gt; of things not done by humans, until just before the Singularity at which<BR>
&gt; &gt; point many things will no longer need to be done by humans (although they<BR>
&gt; &gt; still might want to do them!). But just because some tasks continue to<BR>
&gt; &gt; be automated does not imply an unemployment disaster. Think about how<BR>
&gt; &gt; many tasks have already been automated since 1900, yet we have no problem<BR>
&gt; &gt; finding jobs for practically everyone?<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Count the millions on the dole and also count the umemployment<BR>
&gt; statistics in other industrialized countries before you say we have &quot;no<BR>
&gt; problem finding jobs for practically everyone&quot;.&nbsp; When you add it up I<BR>
&gt; think you will see we have a large problem finding jobs for something<BR>
&gt; closer to 18% of the adult population than to the official 4% unemployed<BR>
&gt; in the US.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless as I reiterate: the unemployment number is at an all-time<BR>
low, the other countries problems are their own creations, and in many<BR>
areas of the world such as Asia there is a huge creation of new higher<BR>
paying jobs.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; actually scarcity based) economic models can continue to run going<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forward without displacing and disowning more and more people.&nbsp; I would<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; very much like to see it differently.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Well we see an example of this here with MP3s/Napster/etc. It remains to<BR>
&gt; &gt; be completely resolved, but most people seem to think that the artists<BR>
&gt; &gt; will still be able to make a living even after the scarcity of the data<BR>
&gt; &gt; distribution is gone. The issue comes down to human creativity I guess-<BR>
&gt; &gt; /that/ will still be scarce until such time as we have full strong AI,<BR>
&gt; &gt; and at that point we will have the Singularity.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Not exactly what I was getting at but you bring up an interesting<BR>
&gt; point.&nbsp; That point being that information is increasingly the basis of<BR>
&gt; our wealth making abilities.&nbsp; And information wants/needs to flow<BR>
&gt; relatively unimpeded if it is going to reach its maximum value as<BR>
&gt; information.&nbsp; We see this increasingly in the Open Source software<BR>
&gt; world.&nbsp; Software, many argue, is best developed and maintained when it<BR>
&gt; is open rather than when it is owned by particular entities and kept<BR>
&gt; closed in its particulars (information).&nbsp; Nanotech will be based on some<BR>
&gt; core technology (assemblers) but will largely be able to produce<BR>
&gt; miraculous results based on information concerning how to build various<BR>
&gt; desired things and more information flowing between nanobots, foglets<BR>
&gt; and so on.&nbsp; Old model business entities based on controlling/owning<BR>
&gt; resources get in the way when the resource is information.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this<BR>
&gt; takes us into an entirely new layer of the onion.<BR>
<BR>
Hehe, yes a fourth potential subject line! Who can say how this will<BR>
develop exactly.<BR>
