&gt; I would say it is unlikely in my opinion that some kind of huge level of<BR>
&gt; unemployment, high enough to significantly slow down the Singularity, is<BR>
&gt; going to happen in the next 10 years. Say 5% chance IMO. Past 2010 my<BR>
&gt; estimate would increase, but I can't give you a percentage. But even at<BR>
&gt; 5%, that is worth chatting about.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
<BR>
fair enough.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm waiting for your ideas...<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Why? So you can rip them apart?&nbsp; I would first like to know that you see<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Do you have something against peer review? :-)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
No.&nbsp; But I do have some sensitivity to times when I don't feel like I'm<BR>
being heard or reasonably fully responded to before the objections<BR>
start.&nbsp; But in these last few messages, I am no longer worthy about that<BR>
being the case here as much.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; the possible problem.&nbsp; Post singularity I can see where a free in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; sense of beer economy for most of today's commodities could work just<BR>
&gt; &gt; fine.&nbsp; Pre-singularity I do not see so clearly at all.&nbsp; Frankly I think<BR>
&gt; &gt; we need to start retraining ourselves that massive consumerism and ever<BR>
&gt; &gt; escalating economic competition is not the way to get to a more<BR>
&gt; &gt; harmonious and ultimately richer future.&nbsp; But I don't know yet how that<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Why not? It has led us this far.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Why not?&nbsp; Do you actually think that competition for the sake of<BR>
competition (which made some sense in a more scarcity based world)<BR>
especially augmented severely will actually lead to relatively<BR>
harmonious conditions?&nbsp; Do you think that existing power centers<BR>
(governments of sizes and shapes, corporations, wealthy groups and<BR>
individuals)&nbsp; should grab up augmentation tools and higher technologies<BR>
in order to become ever more powerful and eventually to make their power<BR>
incontestable?&nbsp; Do you think the current practices of corporate<BR>
espionage, strategic lawsuits, patenting of everything imaginable, lack<BR>
of consumer responsibility, adherence to only or primarily the current<BR>
bottom line, lack of environmental or extra-company consciousness and so<BR>
on will lead more toward peace and a good life for most people as the<BR>
technology increases the ability to exercise these characteristics,<BR>
particularly if the technology is largely owned by this class of<BR>
players?&nbsp; Do you think this sort of setup is conducive to the full<BR>
benefits of nanotech and AI being acheived?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't see how.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
&gt; &gt; comes out to individual, group and national decisions and policies.&nbsp; I<BR>
&gt; &gt; think we need to evolve solutions rather than be in a great hurry to<BR>
&gt; &gt; simply jump on one from the past or a barely cobbled together modern<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Ever heard the expression &quot;don't fix what isn't broken&quot; ? But I digress,<BR>
&gt; I do want to at least discuss the possibilities.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
For those who refuse to look, it ain't broken.&nbsp; Go live on the streets<BR>
for a while and then tell me that all the people there are simply<BR>
worthless bums and that the system is just fine.&nbsp; As good as many things<BR>
are in the current system there are also problems.&nbsp; Some of them are<BR>
systemic.&nbsp; Pouring ever more energy into a system with such systemic<BR>
flaws without addressing them will result in breakdown.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; one.&nbsp; The first step is simply noting where the current system is likely<BR>
&gt; &gt; to have serious deficits that we would very much like to improve upon<BR>
&gt; &gt; without losing benefits of the current system as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; I<BR>
&gt; &gt; certainly agree this will be a neat trick.&nbsp; I am not enough of an<BR>
&gt; &gt; economic theorist to put out what I see a reasonable whole solution.&nbsp; I<BR>
&gt; &gt; am not sure anyone can.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Have you read the writings of Robin Hanson. He is an economist who has<BR>
&gt; studied (as much as anyone at this point I think) the possible effects of<BR>
&gt; nanotech and other advanced tech on society. Nanotech and AI being your<BR>
&gt; bogeymen, I think you should check this out:<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Nanotech and AI are NOT bogeymen to me.&nbsp; Failure to consider the shape<BR>
of the world and the shape we would want it to be as we can more power<BR>
to form it is the bogeyman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nanotech and AI are a major (to say the<BR>
least) infusion of energy and power and knowledge into the system.&nbsp; To<BR>
suppose that the system we have that largely evolved to fit existing<BR>
conditions is appropriate when those conditions change utterly<BR>
regardless of the fact that the context making the system works is fast<BR>
disappearing is folly. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks for the links!&nbsp; I will check some of them out before I post again<BR>
on this subject.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; Reading his stuff, it appears that first off: nanotech without strong AI<BR>
&gt; leads to a gradual improvement of manufacturing, but not some kind of<BR>
&gt; instant overnight &quot;everything is free, and we can do anything&quot; scenario.<BR>
&gt; It still will take a lot of brainpower to design these nano things.<BR>
&gt; Secondly, if AI research does make progress and some commercial products<BR>
&gt; start making inroads, his research shows that it actually will increase<BR>
&gt; wages and jobs up to a certain point (where we get strong AI/Singularity).<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
You cannot have nanotech on any major scale without enabling strong AI. <BR>
It is doubtful if you can get full nanotech without strong AI. They are<BR>
fairly entertwined.&nbsp; It does take a lot of brainpower.&nbsp; Enough that the<BR>
need is another factor driving us fast toward strong AI.&nbsp; Because it<BR>
takes more than brain power and a few CAD tools.&nbsp; It takes true<BR>
intelligent decision making at speeds and quantities not acheivable by<BR>
less than strong AI. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; In the world posited the nanotech can quite easily whip up an airplane<BR>
&gt; &gt; for this fellow at little/no cost.&nbsp; Material things simply need not have<BR>
&gt; &gt; any associated price tag once the technology is sufficiently advanced<BR>
&gt; &gt; and the proper design patterns for the things desired are known and<BR>
&gt; &gt; their development costs amortized.&nbsp; This is an important point.&nbsp; So your<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well I think there is more to it than that. The guy has to pay at a minimum<BR>
&gt; for the material the plane is made of, and the energy required to create it.<BR>
&gt; Plus delivery costs to wherever he lives, insurance most likely, fuel costs,<BR>
&gt; maintenance, hangar space, training lessons, etc. Flying a plane will still<BR>
&gt; not be anywhere near free. Let's face it that nanotech alone is not going<BR>
&gt; to make for a perfect world.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
If the plane is made of common elements freely available (diamonid plane<BR>
would be really cool) then there is no real material cost.&nbsp; Depending on<BR>
the type of plane and its energy needs you may have a point on the cost<BR>
of fuel.&nbsp; Although even conventional fuels (and we could do a lot better<BR>
assuming nanotech) would be a great deal cheaper to produce than today. <BR>
Delivery costs?&nbsp; Depends on whether it is built on site or not. <BR>
Insurance?&nbsp; Against what?&nbsp; The possibility of unrecoverable injury are a<BR>
lot less with full nano-medicine.&nbsp; Maintenance?&nbsp; Self-maintaining. <BR>
Hangar space?&nbsp; Depending on the level of nano-magic it might quitely<BR>
dissamble between uses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Training you probably have a point on unless<BR>
by that time we download many types of instruction fairly directly<BR>
except when we just think it is more fun to do it the &quot;old-fashioned<BR>
way&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
I never said it would make a perfect world, just that we could get an<BR>
awful lot closer to such with this kind of resources available IF we<BR>
envision what kind of world we want to produce and use these increasing<BR>
abilities to move in that direction.&nbsp; Personally, if the only choice was<BR>
to have a hyper-powered version of the same stuff we have today I<BR>
wouldn't be very up for this at all.&nbsp; I could even see it as a curse.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; dreams and enjoyment are only limited by your imagination, creativity,<BR>
&gt; &gt; dedication and that of any others you can interest in your venture.&nbsp; It<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; This doesn't sound any different than what we have today. Nanotech is not<BR>
&gt; going to make it much cheaper for the average Internet startup as far as<BR>
&gt; I can see. It isn't going to make it cheaper for them to advertise or create<BR>
&gt; a brand, or to pay their programmers and other human capital, etc. etc.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
What makes you think you would need to do a conventional internet<BR>
startup to put together a team of people interested in an idea and in<BR>
making it real and useful to a bunch of people?&nbsp; Who the heck needs to<BR>
create a brand?&nbsp; That is behavior needed when you are trying to beat out<BR>
other companies by forming consumer loyalty.&nbsp; It is a mug's game.&nbsp; The<BR>
only loyalty I want is one based on merit of the ideas and their<BR>
implementation.&nbsp; Who needs to pay programmers in a world where you don't<BR>
have to be paid to have your needs and many of your wants met?&nbsp; Thinking<BR>
of &quot;human capital&quot; or any need to think of people as &quot;capital&quot; is one of<BR>
the things I believe we can do better than.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
We are already seeing the beginning of this in some of the open source<BR>
projects.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; is like pure capitalism in that people voluntarily form associations<BR>
&gt; &gt; that they perceive to be in their interests.&nbsp; It is just that the<BR>
&gt; &gt; interests don't have anything really to do with money necessarily or<BR>
&gt; &gt; with &quot;making a living&quot;.&nbsp; They have to do with the joy of creation and of<BR>
&gt; &gt; exploring and of building teams and such.&nbsp; Values that some who are<BR>
&gt; &gt; already independently wealthy know about today.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I just find the whole &quot;everyone stops working because of nanotech&quot; scenario<BR>
&gt; unbelievable. So what if nanotech can whip me up basic goods- it isn't going<BR>
&gt; to help when I want to buy some land for a house, or have custom designs<BR>
&gt; for said house, or provide the cash I need for going to a sporting event<BR>
&gt; or other live event, etc. etc. Sorry, but in a world of nanotech you will<BR>
&gt; still be working 9 to 5.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
They don't stop working.&nbsp; They stop working &quot;for a living&quot; and start<BR>
working to make the things that truly move them real.&nbsp; Who says the<BR>
sporting or live event will cost any cash?&nbsp; Maybe the players do it<BR>
simply because they love it.&nbsp; You can work nine to five &quot;for a living&quot;<BR>
if you want to.&nbsp; I will not.&nbsp; I will work far more than that but I will<BR>
work for joy of what I am doing.&nbsp; I've done more than my share of the<BR>
other kind.&nbsp; It sucks.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Whatever.. but I think I have pointed out well enough that nanotech alone<BR>
&gt; is not going to provide a very big chunk of your dream world. Because you<BR>
&gt; need the human creativity to really do most of the work in the new economy.<BR>
&gt; Therefore you really need strong AI to give you the freedom you want. Agree?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
No.&nbsp; It is a great deal more than just &quot;whatever&quot;.&nbsp; That is pretty<BR>
dismissive of the points I raised.&nbsp; Nanotech leads straight to AI and<BR>
vice versa.&nbsp; It isn't very reasonable imo to fission them apart that<BR>
much.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
You need human creativity.&nbsp; Sure!&nbsp; I agree!&nbsp; You need it far too much to<BR>
squander it in competitive systems like we do today.&nbsp; Systems where the<BR>
wheel is reinvented over and over again because each competitive group<BR>
wants to &quot;own&quot; as much of what it depends on as possible and because<BR>
there are large legal, economic and secrecy hurdles to reusing what has<BR>
already been done elsewhere.&nbsp; This has especially been the case in<BR>
software.&nbsp; After 20 years in the business I think I ought to know. <BR>
Software talent is much too rare, too needed and too critical to waste<BR>
in such pointless duplication or by tieing the algorithms and techniques<BR>
produced to single companies for decades at a time with patents.&nbsp; If we<BR>
don't go to a fully open source model in software soon which means in<BR>
effect that we largely stop putting a price on the software, then I do<BR>
not believe the software - which is much further behind in the race to<BR>
singularity than hardware - will ever come together sufficiently to<BR>
power Singularity level change.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Another manifestation of this issue is the question of the flow of<BR>
information being rich enough and fast enough with as little friction as<BR>
possible in order for the thought and planning and creativity leading to<BR>
Singularity to occur. We are seeing battles there because the old models<BR>
of owning and controlling information are not terribly compatible with<BR>
modern means of storing and moving and sharing information or with the<BR>
modern need and appetitite for information and for the ability to use,<BR>
modify and transform it freely.&nbsp; And information is fast becoming the<BR>
center, the real wealth, of our economy.&nbsp; But you say we don't need<BR>
change and that the old models are good enough still?&nbsp; How?<BR>
<BR>
I, personally, would like to have enough of my living costs taken care<BR>
of to devote full-time to writing software to more directly fuel the<BR>
singularity. But, like most of us, I am caught up &quot;making a living&quot; and<BR>
there aren't that many ways to do that and be writing AI code or even<BR>
tools to rocket-assist software development itself.&nbsp; I have managed to<BR>
position myself to where I design and lead efforts to produce software<BR>
that I think at least cleans up some areas of the software mess and I<BR>
get paid pretty well to do so.&nbsp; But these specialties of mine aren't as<BR>
much in the area I think is most important to get us most quickly to<BR>
singularity-tracked software.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; If we head for Singularity full-bore and gather various powers and<BR>
&gt; &gt; abilities along the way and do not change some of our habitual ways of<BR>
&gt; &gt; thinking, then I am afraid we are headed for wars and conflicts that<BR>
&gt; &gt; will make everything that has come before look tame in comparison.&nbsp; If<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Exactly- which is why we hope to complete our AI before nanotech or<BR>
&gt; uploading become available! It's just too dangerous to give SL1 humans<BR>
&gt; access to such technologies.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Hey!&nbsp; Something I pretty well agree with you on.&nbsp; But I don't think you<BR>
can get to that kind of AI without largely freeing information and<BR>
software from current economic constraints. <BR>
<BR>
Hmmm.&nbsp; So this response of yours makes it clear that you do see things<BR>
wrong with the current system and the attitudes present.&nbsp; I'm a little<BR>
confused.&nbsp; I'm not sure what you think is and &quot;isn't broken&quot;.&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp; <BR>
&gt; &gt; we can't persuade a critical mass that the results of Singularity and<BR>
&gt; &gt; the steps getting there are to their and their children's benefit then<BR>
&gt; &gt; we can expect huge pushback to the point of armed conflict.&nbsp; If the same<BR>
&gt; &gt; provincial and hyper-competitive attitudes go forward we can expect use<BR>
&gt; &gt; of these technological advances for forms of espionage, warfare and<BR>
&gt; &gt; control of other people quite a bit more dire than what we have already<BR>
&gt; &gt; seen.&nbsp; So no, I don't always think that just heading for the Singularity<BR>
&gt; &gt; fullbore alone will save us.&nbsp; On the other claw, it often appears to me<BR>
&gt; &gt; that our ability to reason and work through such conundrums is much too<BR>
&gt; &gt; limited without massive augmentation of our abilities which are part of<BR>
&gt; &gt; what leads us full-bore to Singularity.&nbsp; One can only hope we grow our<BR>
&gt; &gt; hearts and consciousness at a sufficient speed not to abuse our<BR>
&gt; &gt; increasingly powerful minds (natural and artificial) and the other<BR>
&gt; &gt; technologies coming on line too catastrophically.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well it sounds like you might agree with us after all- doesn't it make<BR>
&gt; the most sense to just sneak up on people with a full Singularity before<BR>
&gt; they realize it, and before nanotech and uploading? After the Singularity,<BR>
&gt; assuming all goes well, all of these issues will be moot and everyone<BR>
&gt; can choose to live how they like (again I suggest reading Diaspora).<BR>
<BR>
Well, I have mixed feelings.&nbsp; I certainly deeply understand the<BR>
impulse.&nbsp; But it is an impulse to play God.&nbsp; Not that there is anything<BR>
necessarily so wrong with that that we shouldn't.&nbsp; Someone has to take<BR>
the next step - especially one this HUGE.&nbsp; But the responsibility is<BR>
awesome indeed.&nbsp; And if we mistep the consequences are dire almost<BR>
beyond imagining.&nbsp; I'm certainly not saying we shouldn't go for it.&nbsp; But<BR>
we should think long and hard about how we want to proceed, how best to<BR>
get there with the least pain, and how to exercise what small amount of<BR>
control we have to insure (to the extent we can) the truly fabulous<BR>
results we hope for.&nbsp; I think we can make it to the unbounded future. <BR>
But putting our heads down and charging forward determinedly is not<BR>
sufficient by itself.<BR>
