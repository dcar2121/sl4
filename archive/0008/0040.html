&gt; <BR>
&gt; Al Gore during his acceptance speech tonight sent me a couple of unintended<BR>
&gt; messages as he contributed his share to the Democrats' parade of victimized<BR>
&gt; Americans.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Around 19:10 PST he pointed out an elderly woman in the audience whose only<BR>
&gt; income came from Social Security, and who had to spend half of this income<BR>
&gt; on medications while the evil pharmaceutical companies are allegedly making<BR>
&gt; &quot;record profits.&quot;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Two things:<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; One, this woman didn't plan her life very well. (In fact, she reminds me of<BR>
&gt; my grandparents, who I could tell even as a child were improvident and thus<BR>
&gt; POOR in their old age.)&nbsp; Nothing kept her from saving and investing in<BR>
&gt; equities or in real estate or in SOMETHING during her working life so that<BR>
&gt; she would have an independent wealth base and a stream of investment income<BR>
&gt; in addition to Social Security.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
How in the hell do you know this?&nbsp; Do you know the details of this<BR>
woman's life?&nbsp; Do you know for a fact that she had not only enough for<BR>
herself and any children she may of raised but a bit of bonus that could<BR>
be invested and had the knowledge to invest it?&nbsp; I very seriously doubt<BR>
it.&nbsp; Or are you one of those people who belief that there is no such<BR>
thing as an honest, intelligent and careful person that reaches some set<BR>
of adversity greater than their ability to plan and meet them?&nbsp; Are you<BR>
sure that we are not entering a time where the pace of technological<BR>
change is greater than the speed at which many people can retool their<BR>
skills?&nbsp; Or for that matter a time that is truly postindustrial in that<BR>
much of the population is not needed in fulltime paid position in order<BR>
to meet the needs and wants of all of us?&nbsp; If we are in or about to<BR>
enter such times then we darn well better learn to take care of people<BR>
without assuming they are stupid and/or lazy if they end up without<BR>
their own private means of suppport.&nbsp; The person who you give respect<BR>
and a healthy life to may be someone you love, it may even be yourself<BR>
not to far down the line.&nbsp; Think about it.<BR>
<BR>
Or are the riches of the approaching singularity only for the fleetest<BR>
of foot and the meanest SOBs in the pack?<BR>
