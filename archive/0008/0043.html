&gt; &gt; That is irrelevant to this discussion.&nbsp; In very short order, if most of<BR>
&gt; &gt; our ideas/notions are correct, most places will make Silicon Valley look<BR>
&gt; &gt; like a sleepy backwater.&nbsp; Silicon Valley like effects are right now<BR>
&gt; &gt; beginning to hit many areas of the country.&nbsp; If you check the average<BR>
&gt; &gt; buying power of most of the middle class right through all but the top<BR>
&gt; &gt; of upper middle class, you will see that very little unemployment slack<BR>
&gt; &gt; will/can be taken up by hiring servants.&nbsp; And of course there is the<BR>
&gt; &gt; small truth that most people are not cut out to be servants.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Not cut out for it? I don't buy that; I myself worked in some service-<BR>
&gt; type jobs when I was a teen. Anyone can work those jobs if they can't<BR>
&gt; find anything else to do. <BR>
<BR>
I disagree on two counts.&nbsp; One, we should be able to employ our growing<BR>
wealth and abilities to enable people to do what most suits them and<BR>
most optimizes their personalities and talents, not simply whatever<BR>
someone will pay for.&nbsp; People were meant to be a bit more than salary<BR>
whores imho.&nbsp; I don't think it serves us well to not optimize for each<BR>
person contributing what they do best regardless of whether we have a<BR>
job open for it that pays in the conventional sense or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; What you<BR>
would/could put up with as a teen and what a highly trained but<BR>
currently unemployable physicist can/should put up with are very<BR>
different.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Second, I disagree that everyone can do well whatever they decide to do.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;And as for costs for the middle class, I don't<BR>
&gt; buy that either. If you want to quote me something showing they have less<BR>
&gt; spendable income I would like to see it. As far as most people in this<BR>
&gt; country are concerned, this is the best they've ever had it. I myself<BR>
&gt; live in Atlanta which also is experiencing a real estate and population<BR>
&gt; boom, but we have the option here of growing out into the suburbs. I<BR>
&gt; would argue that such places as San Francisco and NYC are artificially<BR>
&gt; limited by geography, and therefore have no way for the middle class to<BR>
&gt; survive there long term.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I don't have quotes at hand for you of the actual lower buying power in<BR>
some critical areas like housing that the middleclass has today.&nbsp; Those<BR>
studies exist.&nbsp; I simply don't have the time to look them up right now.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, we'll see about all this as time<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; goes by. The middle class may not get back to the level of service they<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoyed in the 1800s, but they already make enough money to use many of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the new services that are becoming available. They may not have full<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time servants, but they will still provide more and more jobs in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; service areas.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Not enough by far.&nbsp; This is not the 1800s and trying to use that as a<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I didn't say it was the 1800s<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
No, you simply used it to mark your point.&nbsp; It isn't very good for that<BR>
purpose.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; fit or even suggestive analogy is pointless.&nbsp; At some point and perhaps<BR>
&gt; &gt; already we must deal with the problem of human beings who are<BR>
&gt; &gt; unemployable and unneeded in the hyper-technological economy.&nbsp; That is,<BR>
&gt; &gt; we must if we care about human beings at all and are actually able to do<BR>
&gt; &gt; anything about the problem.&nbsp; We can, of course, assume this happens only<BR>
&gt; &gt; to Them and will not happen to Us as we are so bright and well-fortuned<BR>
&gt; &gt; and so on.&nbsp; But that is a very self-centered attitude that fully<BR>
&gt; &gt; justifies and can expect quite a bit of backlash.&nbsp; It also paints a<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well I think you should break your response into two different subjects<BR>
&gt; when you respond. One for discussing whether or not we actually will<BR>
&gt; have an unemployment problem, and the other for what to do about such a<BR>
&gt; theoretical event. What would be your solution to the hypothetical problem?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Figure out as quickly as possible how to ensure all have a workable<BR>
standard of living including the prime necessities and room to grow from<BR>
there regardless of whether we have a standard paying job for all of<BR>
those people.&nbsp; As we get closer to nanotech and as technology advances<BR>
we become better able to produce all the necessities and many of the<BR>
wants for everyone with increasingly less human labor involved.&nbsp; I don't<BR>
think I need to quote studies for that point to be pretty obvious.&nbsp; If<BR>
that is so then it is logical that we find ways to distribute these<BR>
goods and services that are less dependent on the recipients being<BR>
employed producing them.&nbsp; As we go forward we should be able to acheive<BR>
greater human freedom rather than following the same &quot;wage-slave&quot; model<BR>
that developed in a very different past than the present, much less the<BR>
near future.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; pretty dismal picture for what we can expect from the hyper-intelligent<BR>
&gt; &gt; AIs if they come on the scene if we assume that such an attitude is the<BR>
&gt; &gt; most logical and intelligent way of dealing with such problems.&nbsp; By the<BR>
&gt; &gt; same logic they will simply ignore us and use most/all of their<BR>
&gt; &gt; resources only for themselves.&nbsp; The result will be our extinction.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well you just made this up, and I'm not sure why. If we have hyper-<BR>
&gt; intelligent AIs then this whole argument is moot- that would be post-<BR>
&gt; Singularity and we really can't say for sure what it would be like.<BR>
&gt; Let's stay on the two topics.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
No.&nbsp; I did not make it up.&nbsp; It has been said on this list that those who<BR>
aren't making it are to blame for their condition and that anyone who<BR>
wants to make it can.&nbsp; It has been suggested that people can slot<BR>
themselves into whatever jobs are paying money and that thus there is no<BR>
problem.&nbsp; If the AIs take this attitude and have no real use for us at<BR>
all or a use that is distasteful and wasteful of human abilities and<BR>
lives then we will not have a very happy ending to our long rise from<BR>
the cave.&nbsp; It is not just one or two topics. These issues are quite<BR>
throughly inter-related and entangled. <BR>
<BR>
The argument is not moot because, hopefully, we can manage to get to the<BR>
singularity with some confidence and buy-in that we are actually headed<BR>
for an improved reality rather than simply our demise.&nbsp; Not many people<BR>
are going to buy in on a hyper technological pig-in-the-poke that might<BR>
produce heaven on earth and then again it might wipe earth and all of us<BR>
out of existence before it really figures out what it is and what it<BR>
wants.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can't figure out what our right relationship is to other<BR>
human beings then it is pretty unlikely we can expect AIs to figure it<BR>
out or especially to come to a relationship with us that we can expect<BR>
to be at all benevolent.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; Your contention is simply an assertion and one that is increasingly<BR>
&gt; &gt; unlikely as the technological basis of all economic activity becomes<BR>
&gt; &gt; increasingly advanced and automated.&nbsp; In the not unimaginable near<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Really? So far your contention is also an assertion, and based on our<BR>
&gt; experience of the last 100 years (which I also consider to be part of<BR>
&gt; the run-up to Singularity) you would be wrong. So by Occam's Razor can<BR>
&gt; we also guess that I may be right, and that our economic progress and<BR>
&gt; low unemployment rate will continue? You on the other hand sound like<BR>
&gt; some of the people around 1900 who were so worried about the age of<BR>
&gt; machinery. (to be blunt)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, but I've tried (as you have) to back up the contention with<BR>
reasonable argument that you have not addressed adequately imho.&nbsp;&nbsp; We<BR>
are not facing something that looks like the last 100 years that much<BR>
unless you condense that amount of change at least 10-fold (this year). <BR>
Even to take that example, how many different economic forces and<BR>
dislocations of workers and economies have occurred in that time?&nbsp; Do<BR>
you notice that this post-industrial problem was first identified in the<BR>
1950s (by Galbraith I believe)?&nbsp; Did you not notice that the US and most<BR>
western countries introduced massive welfare programs to attempt to take<BR>
up some of the slack of people not just naturally being reasonably ok<BR>
due to working in the economy?&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Occam's razor is not applicable in your above argument.&nbsp; Your theories<BR>
are not simpler and even if they are that is not an argument that they<BR>
are more correct.&nbsp;&nbsp; Insulting me by implying I am a Luddite is<BR>
especially foolish.&nbsp; I am quite the opposite.&nbsp; But I refuse to assume<BR>
just because we are exhibiting higher technology that that will<BR>
automatically result in a better world.&nbsp; Do not confuse an attempt to<BR>
envision how to get from here to there with the least pain and the best<BR>
result with a claim that we shouldn't go there at all.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; future un-augmented human beings will not even be able to compete in the<BR>
&gt; &gt; intellectual white-collar areas of the market.&nbsp; With what are the<BR>
&gt; &gt; unemployed and unemployable to obtain such augmentation?&nbsp; In some areas<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Umm, well you do you live in the Valley, you should know that the companies<BR>
&gt; there will do pretty much anything to get employees. In fact today we<BR>
&gt; already have companies like Ford and Delta giving away computers to their<BR>
&gt; employees. I think it is obvious that future companies will give their<BR>
&gt; employees whatever tech and augmentation is required. So bzzt on your<BR>
&gt; suggestion that tech will put info workers out of work.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
That does not follow.&nbsp; Please keep rude noises to yourself.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; of intellectual work you don't even need human level AI to replace human<BR>
&gt; &gt; workers.&nbsp; You simply need computers designed/programmed for focusing<BR>
&gt; &gt; deeply on the delimited problem at hand to the extent they are superior<BR>
&gt; &gt; in cost/benefit to the humans who formerly performed that function.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Can you be more specific as to exactly what jobs here you are referring to?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Specifics are not terribly relevant when attempting to point out the<BR>
obvious.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Car companies in the states at least are blocked from full automation by<BR>
&gt; &gt; unions.&nbsp; But this situation is quite temporary.&nbsp; Much of the<BR>
&gt; &gt; manufacturing jobs in the US already have either been automated or are<BR>
&gt; &gt; now filled where the labor pool is cheaper.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Unlikely, since car companies and by extension their parts suppliers have<BR>
&gt; a vested interest in producing &quot;made in america&quot; cars. Even foreign car<BR>
&gt; companies like Honda, Mercedes, and BMW produce cars here in order to<BR>
&gt; get that distinction.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I think you missed a lot of recent history.&nbsp; &quot;Made in America&quot; is no<BR>
longer considered a good thing when it comes to cars.&nbsp; It hasn't been<BR>
for some time.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Who cares?&nbsp; Anyone that cares to really mark the trends and cares about<BR>
&gt; &gt; the human beings being left by the wayside and cares what that may<BR>
&gt; &gt; portent.&nbsp;&nbsp; How the numbers are calculated, afaik, has been changed many<BR>
&gt; &gt; times since the sixties.&nbsp; Pointing to this one indicator still does<BR>
&gt; &gt; nothing to address what looks to me like an inescapable problem as we go<BR>
&gt; &gt; forward.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Sure it does, it shows that at least since the last time the indicator<BR>
&gt; was changed, our unemployment is at a record low. Any yet by your reasoning<BR>
&gt; we should already be deeply into unemployment issues since our infotech<BR>
&gt; revolution has been going on for over 30 years. When exactly do you see the<BR>
&gt; big jobs collapse occuring?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Are you ignoring how many people are on the dole here and in the other<BR>
Western nations?&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Did<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you read the sci-fi book The Diamond Age? Our society might move towards<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some kind of neo-victorian mode before the Singularity wraps things up.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And what will this wrapping up be like in your view?&nbsp; Do you think human<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; displacement will only occur during full-bore singularity or will some<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of it take place along the way to getting there?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, when I say wrapping up I mean the Singularity itself- i.e. technology<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; suddenly (probably due to a real AI finally waking up) begins changing at<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a near infinite speed, and within a very short time life as we know it is<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; over with (unless you want to stay in a human body on this planet, in that<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; case I'm sure the AI will let you do that). Read Diaspora by Greg Egan if<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you haven't- I'm taking about an Introdus.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I have read most of those books.&nbsp; But my question is, how will we treat<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Did you read Diaspora?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; one another, what is the proper way to treat one another morally, as we<BR>
&gt; &gt; become more and more advanced?&nbsp; Is there a way of making sure as many as<BR>
&gt; &gt; possible win?&nbsp; Is that way global capitalism, or current mixtures, or<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Yes, by accelerating the Singularity (but hey, I'm biased :-)<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; something yet to be found and implemented? Is it actually critical to<BR>
&gt; &gt; our success in reaching the singularity and to the maximum efficiency of<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think this subject is important because yes it is important in terms<BR>
&gt; of reaching the Singularity that we maintain at a minimum our rate of<BR>
&gt; tech development and society stability.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Where will this stability come from if I am even moderately right and<BR>
more and more people feel disenfranchised from the society and more and<BR>
more uneasy with where it is going?&nbsp; You need buy-in as you go as much<BR>
as possible.&nbsp; Do you think that a society where half the population<BR>
believe in bogey-men (angels, demons, young earth and so on) and where<BR>
the average college graduate reads only one book after graduation in<BR>
their entire life is stable?&nbsp; Especially at a time of accelerating<BR>
technological change?&nbsp; Dunno.&nbsp; It looks to me like we aren't doing such<BR>
a bang-up job in a lot of areas that we can just congratulate ourselves<BR>
and call for more of the same.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; any post-singularity society of whatever types of intelligences that all<BR>
&gt; &gt; individualities are cared for enough to maximize their abilities and<BR>
&gt; &gt; outputs (sort of a la STNG)?&nbsp; Or do we believe that endless competition<BR>
&gt; &gt; (which seems to me to be more of a scarcity game) is the only or most<BR>
&gt; &gt; intelligent play that we can/should expect going toward (and hopefully<BR>
&gt; &gt; through) the Singularity?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; No, we (I mean SIAI here) believe that there should be some amount of<BR>
&gt; resources guaranteed to everyone post-Singularity. Things should start<BR>
&gt; out equal. If you look over at the archives of the FoRK list (www.xent.com)<BR>
&gt; there was a debate between Eliezer and some other people on just this<BR>
&gt; subject a couple of days ago.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
OK.&nbsp; Something we at least in part agree on. :-)&nbsp; Although I think it<BR>
goes beyond simply starting out with equal resources if you wish to get<BR>
the maximum good from each being that they are capable of producing.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly let me lay out my timeline, I place the Singularity no later than<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2020. From now till then I don't see massive unemployment, due to the fact<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that service jobs and technology jobs will continue to increase, and the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only automation will continue to be in areas where there are no strong<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unions, and jobs are simple enough to be done by dumb machines.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; You can't get there from here.&nbsp; There must be ever increasing machine<BR>
&gt; &gt; intelligence and automation all along the path if we are to reach 2020.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I disagree, the only thing that we (SIAI again) need to get our Singularity<BR>
&gt; done is a certain base level of computational power (which we will probably<BR>
&gt; have no later than 2010, and which does not require any form of AI to<BR>
&gt; develop), and the programmers and other scientists to develop the code<BR>
&gt; to run on it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
We wil&nbsp; have several years of increasing technology and its<BR>
ramifications on society to go through to get there.&nbsp; I don't think your<BR>
agreement or lack of same changes that.&nbsp; This software needed will not<BR>
spring full-grown out of nowhere any more than the computational power<BR>
will.<BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; One or two advances in computational density without advances in<BR>
&gt; &gt; software and other areas (for instance) will not get us there.&nbsp; It is a<BR>
&gt; &gt; continuous curve (more or less) up to that point.&nbsp; The above doesn't<BR>
&gt; &gt; seem to acknowledge points that I believe are inevitable along the way.<BR>
&gt; &gt; We will see many service jobs (I think Moravec mentioned fast food<BR>
&gt; &gt; workers once) disappear along the way.&nbsp; We will see levels of home<BR>
&gt; &gt; automation and new products that make personal servants much less<BR>
&gt; &gt; likely.&nbsp; We will see the unions cracked open (already happening) as they<BR>
&gt; &gt; become increasingly a drag on hyper-production.&nbsp; The machines will and<BR>
&gt; &gt; must become ever increasingly less dumb if we are ever to arrive at<BR>
&gt; &gt; singularity.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think you're right that the curve will continue heading up (even though<BR>
&gt; we don't need all of it), but on the other hand I still don't buy your<BR>
&gt; argument of an unemployment disaster. Who is going to design, build, sell,<BR>
&gt; install, and maintain all these wonderful new toys? The more toys we<BR>
&gt; invent, the more jobs there will be created. Even if some services do<BR>
&gt; eventually lose jobs, I don't see the collapse you are predicting. I'll<BR>
&gt; have to go see if I can find any kind of academic works to back up my<BR>
&gt; assertion, or perhaps someone on the list has something to say.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
There will of course be engineers, scientists, marketing folk and so on<BR>
involved in producing and exploiting the coming advances.&nbsp; That<BR>
certainly does not say that everyone will be employed in the needed<BR>
capacities.&nbsp; I did not predict a collapse actually.&nbsp; I just predict a<BR>
growing problem that it is important for us to address well.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;As the<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; citizens of the world get gradually richer, demand for these services and<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; luxury products will continue to rise, creating jobs in service and artisan<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; areas. Etc. etc.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; If we continue with the current model then fewer and fewer people will<BR>
&gt; &gt; get rich enough relatively to hire the others and fewer of them will<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Whaaa? We have more millionaires here in the US than at any other time.<BR>
&gt; All I see is more and more people making more and more money.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
We have more millionaires and the actual buying power of a million<BR>
dollars in considerably less than it was at mid century or even a few<BR>
decades ago.&nbsp; You can have wheelbarrows full of money and still have a<BR>
very lopsided distribution of wealth where only a few can hire that many<BR>
others (as you suggested would occur).<BR>
<BR>
In some types of real wealth we are much better off.&nbsp; There are many<BR>
types of wealth now common (information technology based mostly) that<BR>
could not be had at any price before.&nbsp; But the effect of these great<BR>
liberators has not been as much liberation of human throught and<BR>
creativity as it should have been.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; need/want human beings to perform tasks that can be more efficiently<BR>
&gt; &gt; handled by automation.&nbsp; The residue of things that only humans can do<BR>
&gt; &gt; will shrink over time.&nbsp; I see no way current competition based (and<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; It will very slowly shrink, I would predict along the same lines as the<BR>
&gt; Singularity itself proceeds.. there will be a slow growth in the types<BR>
&gt; of things not done by humans, until just before the Singularity at which<BR>
&gt; point many things will no longer need to be done by humans (although they<BR>
&gt; still might want to do them!). But just because some tasks continue to<BR>
&gt; be automated does not imply an unemployment disaster. Think about how<BR>
&gt; many tasks have already been automated since 1900, yet we have no problem<BR>
&gt; finding jobs for practically everyone?<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Count the millions on the dole and also count the umemployment<BR>
statistics in other industrialized countries before you say we have &quot;no<BR>
problem finding jobs for practically everyone&quot;.&nbsp; When you add it up I<BR>
think you will see we have a large problem finding jobs for something<BR>
closer to 18% of the adult population than to the official 4% unemployed<BR>
in the US.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
&gt; &gt; actually scarcity based) economic models can continue to run going<BR>
&gt; &gt; forward without displacing and disowning more and more people.&nbsp; I would<BR>
&gt; &gt; very much like to see it differently.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well we see an example of this here with MP3s/Napster/etc. It remains to<BR>
&gt; be completely resolved, but most people seem to think that the artists<BR>
&gt; will still be able to make a living even after the scarcity of the data<BR>
&gt; distribution is gone. The issue comes down to human creativity I guess-<BR>
&gt; /that/ will still be scarce until such time as we have full strong AI,<BR>
&gt; and at that point we will have the Singularity.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
<BR>
Not exactly what I was getting at but you bring up an interesting<BR>
point.&nbsp; That point being that information is increasingly the basis of<BR>
our wealth making abilities.&nbsp; And information wants/needs to flow<BR>
relatively unimpeded if it is going to reach its maximum value as<BR>
information.&nbsp; We see this increasingly in the Open Source software<BR>
world.&nbsp; Software, many argue, is best developed and maintained when it<BR>
is open rather than when it is owned by particular entities and kept<BR>
closed in its particulars (information).&nbsp; Nanotech will be based on some<BR>
core technology (assemblers) but will largely be able to produce<BR>
miraculous results based on information concerning how to build various<BR>
desired things and more information flowing between nanobots, foglets<BR>
and so on.&nbsp; Old model business entities based on controlling/owning<BR>
resources get in the way when the resource is information.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this<BR>
takes us into an entirely new layer of the onion.&nbsp; <BR>
