&gt; &gt; &gt; The way we currently do economics I would agree that this sort of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; program doesn't work very well.&nbsp; But the entire basis for our current<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; economics, scarcity, is fast disappearing as we go forward toward<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; singularity.&nbsp; So I think there is room to rewrite the fundamental<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; equations and to design something that isn't just the same as some label<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we have already suffered with.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Ok, still no answer or specifics. If you really don't have an answer on<BR>
&gt; &gt; how to handle the theoretical increasing unemployment, then just say so.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I think I have said so.&nbsp; Do I at least have your agreement that this is<BR>
&gt; a potential problem and one to be expected at some point in our<BR>
&gt; progress?<BR>
<BR>
I would say it is unlikely in my opinion that some kind of huge level of<BR>
unemployment, high enough to significantly slow down the Singularity, is<BR>
going to happen in the next 10 years. Say 5% chance IMO. Past 2010 my<BR>
estimate would increase, but I can't give you a percentage. But even at<BR>
5%, that is worth chatting about.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; May I suggest you move to Sweden? I hear they have a 50%+ tax rate for<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the productive individuals, and the highest percentge of leeches (oops,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I mean &quot;people without a standard paying job&quot;) in the world.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is easy to throw out this sort of response.&nbsp; It is more difficult to<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think about how to address the problem, if indeed there is one.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; I'm waiting for your ideas...<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Why? So you can rip them apart?&nbsp; I would first like to know that you see<BR>
<BR>
Do you have something against peer review? :-)<BR>
<BR>
&gt; the possible problem.&nbsp; Post singularity I can see where a free in the<BR>
&gt; sense of beer economy for most of today's commodities could work just<BR>
&gt; fine.&nbsp; Pre-singularity I do not see so clearly at all.&nbsp; Frankly I think<BR>
&gt; we need to start retraining ourselves that massive consumerism and ever<BR>
&gt; escalating economic competition is not the way to get to a more<BR>
&gt; harmonious and ultimately richer future.&nbsp; But I don't know yet how that<BR>
<BR>
Why not? It has led us this far.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; comes out to individual, group and national decisions and policies.&nbsp; I<BR>
&gt; think we need to evolve solutions rather than be in a great hurry to<BR>
&gt; simply jump on one from the past or a barely cobbled together modern<BR>
<BR>
Ever heard the expression &quot;don't fix what isn't broken&quot; ? But I digress,<BR>
I do want to at least discuss the possibilities.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; one.&nbsp; The first step is simply noting where the current system is likely<BR>
&gt; to have serious deficits that we would very much like to improve upon<BR>
&gt; without losing benefits of the current system as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; I<BR>
&gt; certainly agree this will be a neat trick.&nbsp; I am not enough of an<BR>
&gt; economic theorist to put out what I see a reasonable whole solution.&nbsp; I<BR>
&gt; am not sure anyone can.<BR>
<BR>
Have you read the writings of Robin Hanson. He is an economist who has<BR>
studied (as much as anyone at this point I think) the possible effects of<BR>
nanotech and other advanced tech on society. Nanotech and AI being your<BR>
bogeymen, I think you should check this out:<BR>

Reading his stuff, it appears that first off: nanotech without strong AI<BR>
leads to a gradual improvement of manufacturing, but not some kind of<BR>
instant overnight &quot;everything is free, and we can do anything&quot; scenario.<BR>
It still will take a lot of brainpower to design these nano things.<BR>
Secondly, if AI research does make progress and some commercial products<BR>
start making inroads, his research shows that it actually will increase<BR>
wages and jobs up to a certain point (where we get strong AI/Singularity).<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If, just as a for instance I don't know how to get to, if every person<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had a decent living wage and all the physical necessities taken care of<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (a la cheap nano-tech matter assemblers for instance), then every person<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be quite busily employed - doing exactly what they themselves find<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; most meaningful and interesting regardless of whether they are getting a<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; conventional paycheck for it.&nbsp; Personally I would have a hell of a lot<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more to do than watching TV if I no longer had to work for someone else<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for a living.&nbsp; I have more things to do and explore and work on than I<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could finish in a hundred lifetimes of such 'pointless empty leisure'.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; It just doesn't make sense to me- ok let's take an extreme case to make<BR>
&gt; &gt; my point: let's say some guy has a dream: to fly airplanes. You can give<BR>
&gt; &gt; him his standard dole, but that isn't going to do anything in the least<BR>
&gt; &gt; to get him anywhere near his dream. So I simply don't buy your claim that<BR>
&gt; &gt; by giving everyone a bit of cash each month they are all going to be<BR>
&gt; &gt; perfectly happy. I will hold to my claim that the more people on the dole,<BR>
&gt; &gt; the more general unhappiness you will have.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; In the world posited the nanotech can quite easily whip up an airplane<BR>
&gt; for this fellow at little/no cost.&nbsp; Material things simply need not have<BR>
&gt; any associated price tag once the technology is sufficiently advanced<BR>
&gt; and the proper design patterns for the things desired are known and<BR>
&gt; their development costs amortized.&nbsp; This is an important point.&nbsp; So your<BR>
<BR>
Well I think there is more to it than that. The guy has to pay at a minimum<BR>
for the material the plane is made of, and the energy required to create it.<BR>
Plus delivery costs to wherever he lives, insurance most likely, fuel costs,<BR>
maintenance, hangar space, training lessons, etc. Flying a plane will still<BR>
not be anywhere near free. Let's face it that nanotech alone is not going<BR>
to make for a perfect world.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; dreams and enjoyment are only limited by your imagination, creativity,<BR>
&gt; dedication and that of any others you can interest in your venture.&nbsp; It<BR>
<BR>
This doesn't sound any different than what we have today. Nanotech is not<BR>
going to make it much cheaper for the average Internet startup as far as<BR>
I can see. It isn't going to make it cheaper for them to advertise or create<BR>
a brand, or to pay their programmers and other human capital, etc. etc.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; is like pure capitalism in that people voluntarily form associations<BR>
&gt; that they perceive to be in their interests.&nbsp; It is just that the<BR>
&gt; interests don't have anything really to do with money necessarily or<BR>
&gt; with &quot;making a living&quot;.&nbsp; They have to do with the joy of creation and of<BR>
&gt; exploring and of building teams and such.&nbsp; Values that some who are<BR>
&gt; already independently wealthy know about today.<BR>
<BR>
I just find the whole &quot;everyone stops working because of nanotech&quot; scenario<BR>
unbelievable. So what if nanotech can whip me up basic goods- it isn't going<BR>
to help when I want to buy some land for a house, or have custom designs<BR>
for said house, or provide the cash I need for going to a sporting event<BR>
or other live event, etc. etc. Sorry, but in a world of nanotech you will<BR>
still be working 9 to 5.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; The only time you will achieve what you really want is when everyone who<BR>
&gt; &gt; wants to is uploaded into an environment that truly allows people to be<BR>
&gt; &gt; able to accomplish whatever they can think of. It simply is not going to<BR>
&gt; &gt; happen on this planet in our current state of affairs.<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; But the world you posited, post-nanotech, is very much NOT our current<BR>
&gt; state of affairs.&nbsp; That is the point.&nbsp; It is too easy to try to put new<BR>
&gt; wine in the same old bottles.&nbsp; The base state changes radically.&nbsp; In a<BR>
&gt; sufficiently advanced post-nano world it will be increasingly difficult<BR>
&gt; to distinquish between the freedom and limits in a full VR and those<BR>
&gt; available in the &quot;real&quot; world.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Even without going that far, even with some physical resources still<BR>
&gt; relatively scarce but vastly more wealth and leisure in the system,<BR>
&gt; people can still voluntarily pool their resources for projects they wish<BR>
&gt; to take on that are larger than the resources commanded by an<BR>
&gt; individual.&nbsp; Is that a type of monetary system? Sure.&nbsp; But with people<BR>
&gt; much freer than they are today to gather some amount of money over and<BR>
&gt; above their needs and wants without having to have a fulltime &quot;job&quot; to<BR>
&gt; do so.<BR>
<BR>
Whatever.. but I think I have pointed out well enough that nanotech alone<BR>
is not going to provide a very big chunk of your dream world. Because you<BR>
need the human creativity to really do most of the work in the new economy.<BR>
Therefore you really need strong AI to give you the freedom you want. Agree?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; Going on that fact, along with the fact that 150k+ people are dying each<BR>
&gt; &gt; day we sit around twiddling our thumbs, it makes the most sense from my<BR>
&gt; &gt; perspective to focus all our energies on getting to the Singularity ASAP.<BR>
&gt; &gt; I am only interested in this unemployment issue so far as it might affect<BR>
&gt; &gt; that goal.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; If we head for Singularity full-bore and gather various powers and<BR>
&gt; abilities along the way and do not change some of our habitual ways of<BR>
&gt; thinking, then I am afraid we are headed for wars and conflicts that<BR>
&gt; will make everything that has come before look tame in comparison.&nbsp; If<BR>
<BR>
Exactly- which is why we hope to complete our AI before nanotech or<BR>
uploading become available! It's just too dangerous to give SL1 humans<BR>
access to such technologies.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; we can't persuade a critical mass that the results of Singularity and<BR>
&gt; the steps getting there are to their and their children's benefit then<BR>
&gt; we can expect huge pushback to the point of armed conflict.&nbsp; If the same<BR>
&gt; provincial and hyper-competitive attitudes go forward we can expect use<BR>
&gt; of these technological advances for forms of espionage, warfare and<BR>
&gt; control of other people quite a bit more dire than what we have already<BR>
&gt; seen.&nbsp; So no, I don't always think that just heading for the Singularity<BR>
&gt; fullbore alone will save us.&nbsp; On the other claw, it often appears to me<BR>
&gt; that our ability to reason and work through such conundrums is much too<BR>
&gt; limited without massive augmentation of our abilities which are part of<BR>
&gt; what leads us full-bore to Singularity.&nbsp; One can only hope we grow our<BR>
&gt; hearts and consciousness at a sufficient speed not to abuse our<BR>
&gt; increasingly powerful minds (natural and artificial) and the other<BR>
&gt; technologies coming on line too catastrophically.<BR>
<BR>
Well it sounds like you might agree with us after all- doesn't it make<BR>
the most sense to just sneak up on people with a full Singularity before<BR>
they realize it, and before nanotech and uploading? After the Singularity,<BR>
assuming all goes well, all of these issues will be moot and everyone<BR>
can choose to live how they like (again I suggest reading Diaspora).<BR>
