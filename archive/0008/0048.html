&gt; That's great, but you totally forgot to answer my question.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; The way we currently do economics I would agree that this sort of<BR>
&gt; &gt; program doesn't work very well.&nbsp; But the entire basis for our current<BR>
&gt; &gt; economics, scarcity, is fast disappearing as we go forward toward<BR>
&gt; &gt; singularity.&nbsp; So I think there is room to rewrite the fundamental<BR>
&gt; &gt; equations and to design something that isn't just the same as some label<BR>
&gt; &gt; we have already suffered with.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Ok, still no answer or specifics. If you really don't have an answer on<BR>
&gt; how to handle the theoretical increasing unemployment, then just say so.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
<BR>
I think I have said so.&nbsp; Do I at least have your agreement that this is<BR>
a potential problem and one to be expected at some point in our<BR>
progress?<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; May I suggest you move to Sweden? I hear they have a 50%+ tax rate for<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the productive individuals, and the highest percentge of leeches (oops,<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean &quot;people without a standard paying job&quot;) in the world.<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; It is easy to throw out this sort of response.&nbsp; It is more difficult to<BR>
&gt; &gt; think about how to address the problem, if indeed there is one.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; I'm waiting for your ideas...<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
Why? So you can rip them apart?&nbsp; I would first like to know that you see<BR>
the possible problem.&nbsp; Post singularity I can see where a free in the<BR>
sense of beer economy for most of today's commodities could work just<BR>
fine.&nbsp; Pre-singularity I do not see so clearly at all.&nbsp; Frankly I think<BR>
we need to start retraining ourselves that massive consumerism and ever<BR>
escalating economic competition is not the way to get to a more<BR>
harmonious and ultimately richer future.&nbsp; But I don't know yet how that<BR>
comes out to individual, group and national decisions and policies.&nbsp; I<BR>
think we need to evolve solutions rather than be in a great hurry to<BR>
simply jump on one from the past or a barely cobbled together modern<BR>
one.&nbsp; The first step is simply noting where the current system is likely<BR>
to have serious deficits that we would very much like to improve upon<BR>
without losing benefits of the current system as much as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; I<BR>
certainly agree this will be a neat trick.&nbsp; I am not enough of an<BR>
economic theorist to put out what I see a reasonable whole solution.&nbsp; I<BR>
am not sure anyone can.<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; I never once said that higher taxes are the way to address the problem.<BR>
&gt; &gt; I don't think they are.&nbsp; I don't know, honestly, what the answer is or<BR>
&gt; &gt; looks like.&nbsp; But I think it is high time we started to think quite<BR>
&gt; &gt; seriously about whether the current economic model is reasonable to<BR>
&gt; &gt; carry forward or if we should design something new to meet the<BR>
&gt; &gt; increasingly quite different economic context.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well I have absolutely failed to convince you that we don't need to worry.<BR>
&gt; So let's go into the theoretical direction of an unemployment problem,<BR>
&gt; and let's assume it is so bad that it affects progress towards Singularity<BR>
&gt; significantly. If none of us has ideas on how to handle that scenario, then<BR>
&gt; what are we left to discuss?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; If, just as a for instance I don't know how to get to, if every person<BR>
&gt; &gt; had a decent living wage and all the physical necessities taken care of<BR>
&gt; &gt; (a la cheap nano-tech matter assemblers for instance), then every person<BR>
&gt; &gt; can be quite busily employed - doing exactly what they themselves find<BR>
&gt; &gt; most meaningful and interesting regardless of whether they are getting a<BR>
&gt; &gt; conventional paycheck for it.&nbsp; Personally I would have a hell of a lot<BR>
&gt; &gt; more to do than watching TV if I no longer had to work for someone else<BR>
&gt; &gt; for a living.&nbsp; I have more things to do and explore and work on than I<BR>
&gt; &gt; could finish in a hundred lifetimes of such 'pointless empty leisure'.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; It just doesn't make sense to me- ok let's take an extreme case to make<BR>
&gt; my point: let's say some guy has a dream: to fly airplanes. You can give<BR>
&gt; him his standard dole, but that isn't going to do anything in the least<BR>
&gt; to get him anywhere near his dream. So I simply don't buy your claim that<BR>
&gt; by giving everyone a bit of cash each month they are all going to be<BR>
&gt; perfectly happy. I will hold to my claim that the more people on the dole,<BR>
&gt; the more general unhappiness you will have.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
In the world posited the nanotech can quite easily whip up an airplane<BR>
for this fellow at little/no cost.&nbsp; Material things simply need not have<BR>
any associated price tag once the technology is sufficiently advanced<BR>
and the proper design patterns for the things desired are known and<BR>
their development costs amortized.&nbsp; This is an important point.&nbsp; So your<BR>
dreams and enjoyment are only limited by your imagination, creativity,<BR>
dedication and that of any others you can interest in your venture.&nbsp; It<BR>
is like pure capitalism in that people voluntarily form associations<BR>
that they perceive to be in their interests.&nbsp; It is just that the<BR>
interests don't have anything really to do with money necessarily or<BR>
with &quot;making a living&quot;.&nbsp; They have to do with the joy of creation and of<BR>
exploring and of building teams and such.&nbsp; Values that some who are<BR>
already independently wealthy know about today.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
 <BR>
&gt; The only time you will achieve what you really want is when everyone who<BR>
&gt; wants to is uploaded into an environment that truly allows people to be<BR>
&gt; able to accomplish whatever they can think of. It simply is not going to<BR>
&gt; happen on this planet in our current state of affairs.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
But the world you posited, post-nanotech, is very much NOT our current<BR>
state of affairs.&nbsp; That is the point.&nbsp; It is too easy to try to put new<BR>
wine in the same old bottles.&nbsp; The base state changes radically.&nbsp; In a<BR>
sufficiently advanced post-nano world it will be increasingly difficult<BR>
to distinquish between the freedom and limits in a full VR and those<BR>
available in the &quot;real&quot; world.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
Even without going that far, even with some physical resources still<BR>
relatively scarce but vastly more wealth and leisure in the system,<BR>
people can still voluntarily pool their resources for projects they wish<BR>
to take on that are larger than the resources commanded by an<BR>
individual.&nbsp; Is that a type of monetary system? Sure.&nbsp; But with people<BR>
much freer than they are today to gather some amount of money over and<BR>
above their needs and wants without having to have a fulltime &quot;job&quot; to<BR>
do so. <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; Going on that fact, along with the fact that 150k+ people are dying each<BR>
&gt; day we sit around twiddling our thumbs, it makes the most sense from my<BR>
&gt; perspective to focus all our energies on getting to the Singularity ASAP.<BR>
&gt; I am only interested in this unemployment issue so far as it might affect<BR>
&gt; that goal.<BR>
<BR>
If we head for Singularity full-bore and gather various powers and<BR>
abilities along the way and do not change some of our habitual ways of<BR>
thinking, then I am afraid we are headed for wars and conflicts that<BR>
will make everything that has come before look tame in comparison.&nbsp; If<BR>
we can't persuade a critical mass that the results of Singularity and<BR>
the steps getting there are to their and their children's benefit then<BR>
we can expect huge pushback to the point of armed conflict.&nbsp; If the same<BR>
provincial and hyper-competitive attitudes go forward we can expect use<BR>
of these technological advances for forms of espionage, warfare and<BR>
control of other people quite a bit more dire than what we have already<BR>
seen.&nbsp; So no, I don't always think that just heading for the Singularity<BR>
fullbore alone will save us.&nbsp; On the other claw, it often appears to me<BR>
that our ability to reason and work through such conundrums is much too<BR>
limited without massive augmentation of our abilities which are part of<BR>
what leads us full-bore to Singularity.&nbsp; One can only hope we grow our<BR>
hearts and consciousness at a sufficient speed not to abuse our<BR>
increasingly powerful minds (natural and artificial) and the other<BR>
technologies coming on line too catastrophically.&nbsp; <BR>
