&gt; &gt; I disagree on two counts.&nbsp; One, we should be able to employ our growing<BR>
&gt; &gt; wealth and abilities to enable people to do what most suits them and<BR>
&gt; &gt; most optimizes their personalities and talents, not simply whatever<BR>
&gt; &gt; someone will pay for.&nbsp; People were meant to be a bit more than salary<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &quot;meant&quot;? Are you implying some kind of creator?<BR>
<BR>
No, I am implying simple human dignity.&nbsp; Do you have a problem with that<BR>
concept?&nbsp; Do you believe that the market always functions so properly<BR>
that everyone with good skill that are beneficial to have in use will<BR>
find a paying job using those skills?&nbsp; It hasn't been true too many<BR>
times unfortunately.&nbsp; Or do you not find it tragic when physicists are<BR>
out pumping gas or flipping burgers for a living?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; &gt; whores imho.&nbsp; I don't think it serves us well to not optimize for each<BR>
&gt; &gt; person contributing what they do best regardless of whether we have a<BR>
&gt; &gt; job open for it that pays in the conventional sense or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; What you<BR>
&gt; &gt; would/could put up with as a teen and what a highly trained but<BR>
&gt; &gt; currently unemployable physicist can/should put up with are very<BR>
&gt; &gt; different.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Sounds like what the communists wanted/promised. <BR>
<BR>
Where the heck did that come from?&nbsp; I am attempting to express something<BR>
I see as a problem and you paste a label on it and seem to miss the<BR>
essence of the issue and go off battling with your label instead.&nbsp; The<BR>
communists were not all wet in everything they thought a worthwhile<BR>
goal.&nbsp; Their methods were pretty-much all wet as was a lot of the<BR>
original theory.&nbsp; But some of the things they wanted to improve are in<BR>
fact things that it would be good to improve if at all possible.<BR>
<BR>
&gt;It sure isn't ultra-<BR>
&gt; capitalism as I know it. <BR>
<BR>
And this &quot;ultra-capitalism&quot; is supposed to be a really good thing?&nbsp; Are<BR>
you sure?&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&gt;How exactly would the jobs be provided for the<BR>
&gt; &quot;worthy&quot; if no one wants to hire them? <BR>
<BR>
If the jobs can be done more economically and efficiently by automation<BR>
and AIs in a particular area then what motivation do I as employer have<BR>
to hire less efficient and highly problematic humans instead?&nbsp; If enough<BR>
jobs go in this direction then humans will become increasingly<BR>
unemployable.&nbsp; Unless you believe this is ok if that is the way it is<BR>
and it is ok that these people starve if they can't find work, then<BR>
something, somehow needs to be done about it. Now, I come from a pure<BR>
libertarian and even objectivist background. Saying these things rankles<BR>
against a lot of my own former pet beliefs.&nbsp; But I don't see any holes<BR>
in the logic sufficient to make the problem just go away.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&gt;Government subsidies backed by<BR>
&gt; a massive tax and spend program? I'm sorry, but the world (at least pre-<BR>
&gt; Singularity) is not perfect. If someone can't learn what they need to<BR>
&gt; learn to get a &quot;good&quot; job in the new economy, then they are going to<BR>
&gt; have to take whatever work they can get.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
The way we currently do economics I would agree that this sort of<BR>
program doesn't work very well.&nbsp; But the entire basis for our current<BR>
economics, scarcity, is fast disappearing as we go forward toward<BR>
singularity.&nbsp; So I think there is room to rewrite the fundamental<BR>
equations and to design something that isn't just the same as some label<BR>
we have already suffered with. <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Second, I disagree that everyone can do well whatever they decide to do.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Where did I say that? All I said was that they could do it- not that they<BR>
&gt; would love it, or be excellent at it.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
If the don't do it well and are not happy and most of all are not using<BR>
their best talents then the society, all of us, are a little bit poorer<BR>
than we could be if these folks full talent was online.<BR>
<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical event. What would be your solution to the hypothetical problem?<BR>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt;<BR>
&gt; &gt; Figure out as quickly as possible how to ensure all have a workable<BR>
&gt; &gt; standard of living including the prime necessities and room to grow from<BR>
&gt; &gt; there regardless of whether we have a standard paying job for all of<BR>
&gt; &gt; those people.&nbsp; As we get closer to nanotech and as technology advances<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; May I suggest you move to Sweden? I hear they have a 50%+ tax rate for<BR>
&gt; the productive individuals, and the highest percentge of leeches (oops,<BR>
&gt; I mean &quot;people without a standard paying job&quot;) in the world.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
It is easy to throw out this sort of response.&nbsp; It is more difficult to<BR>
think about how to address the problem, if indeed there is one.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; we become better able to produce all the necessities and many of the<BR>
&gt; &gt; wants for everyone with increasingly less human labor involved.&nbsp; I don't<BR>
&gt; &gt; think I need to quote studies for that point to be pretty obvious.&nbsp; If<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; Well it isn't obvious to me why penalizing (through higher taxes) the people<BR>
&gt; who actually go through the trouble to learn how to work in the new economy<BR>
&gt; in order to support the losers is such a good idea.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
I never once said that higher taxes are the way to address the problem. <BR>
I don't think they are.&nbsp; I don't know, honestly, what the answer is or<BR>
looks like.&nbsp; But I think it is high time we started to think quite<BR>
seriously about whether the current economic model is reasonable to<BR>
carry forward or if we should design something new to meet the<BR>
increasingly quite different economic context.&nbsp; <BR>
 <BR>
&gt; &gt; that is so then it is logical that we find ways to distribute these<BR>
&gt; &gt; goods and services that are less dependent on the recipients being<BR>
&gt; &gt; employed producing them.&nbsp; As we go forward we should be able to acheive<BR>
&gt; &gt; greater human freedom rather than following the same &quot;wage-slave&quot; model<BR>
&gt; &gt; that developed in a very different past than the present, much less the<BR>
&gt; &gt; near future.<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; That sounds nice, but can specifically describe your future scenario<BR>
&gt; showing me how all this is going to work?<BR>
&gt; <BR>
&gt; P.S. you do realize that your average person who can't get a job tends to<BR>
&gt; get depressed and unhappy? They want something to do, and if watching TV<BR>
&gt; is all they have, they tend to head off sometimes into self-destructive<BR>
&gt; behaviors. If we rush to put 50% of our workforce out of work just &quot;because<BR>
&gt; we can&quot; and we &quot;want to increase happiness&quot;, we may the exact opposite<BR>
&gt; effect for many people.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
<BR>
If, just as a for instance I don't know how to get to, if every person<BR>
had a decent living wage and all the physical necessities taken care of<BR>
(a la cheap nano-tech matter assemblers for instance), then every person<BR>
can be quite busily employed - doing exactly what they themselves find<BR>
most meaningful and interesting regardless of whether they are getting a<BR>
conventional paycheck for it.&nbsp; Personally I would have a hell of a lot<BR>
more to do than watching TV if I no longer had to work for someone else<BR>
for a living.&nbsp; I have more things to do and explore and work on than I<BR>
could finish in a hundred lifetimes of such 'pointless empty leisure'.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
I have to be up very early tomorrow so I'll address more things later.<BR>
