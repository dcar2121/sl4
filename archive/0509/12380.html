<em>&gt; &gt; If we succeed, we should have an &quot;artificial child&quot; of a sort that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communicate using complex if not humanlike English and that can solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; commonsense reasoning problems, posed in the context of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level of an average 10-year-old.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you make of the AAII group's 'animal-level cognition first'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifesto? Do you already have this, or do you think it's irrelevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or skippable (my position is that it's the wrong way of approaching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the generation of a relevant competence set)?
</em><br>
<p>I think it is a reasonable approach in principle, but, that there is a huge
<br>
risk of making a design that is &quot;overfit&quot; to the problem of animal-level
<br>
cognition.
<br>
<p>In other words, just because some biological animal minds (not most!) seem
<br>
to be tweakable/extensible to yield human-level intelligence, it doesn't
<br>
follow that all animal-level minds will be thus tweakable/extensible...
<br>
<p>And I think that the vast majority of minds that can achieve animal-level
<br>
intelligence will NOT be tweakable/extensible into human-level
<br>
intelligences...
<br>
<p>So, I only like the animal-level-first approach IF the
<br>
animal-level-cognition
<br>
work is carried out within a framework that is clearly theoretically
<br>
extensible
<br>
to human-level intelligence.
<br>
<p>Based on the limited information I have about their work I am not
<br>
so confident that the A2I2 approach fulfills this criterion, but my
<br>
knowledge of their work is of course limited...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I believe there is a strong argument that the step from this kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of artificial child to a superhuman AI is not as big as the step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from right here, right now to the artificial child.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That argument depends on the opacity of the design. Using more brute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force and emergence lowers the design complexity bar for producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AGI, at the cost of making self-improvement much harder due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the difficultly or total lack of deliberative self-modification (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incidentally making it a UFAI and hence an extincion event).
</em><br>
<p>It's true that one could design an artificial child in such a way that
<br>
it would be difficult for this child to become progressively more and
<br>
more intelligent and sophisticated.
<br>
<p>However, within the Novamente framework, a lot of thought has already
<br>
been put into how this latter transition would take place, so I don't
<br>
think this kind of &quot;overfitting to the artificial child&quot; level will
<br>
occur.  The Novamente design should allow for a child-level Novamente
<br>
system to gradually decrease its opacity level as it improves its
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>Given the specifics of Novamente, I am extremely confident that IF
<br>
we can achieve an artificial child, then we can go far beyond that
<br>
level....  There is more uncertainty in achieving the artificial
<br>
child in the first place...
