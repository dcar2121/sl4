<p>I have only quoted Eliezer's response, here, but I could have picked out 
<br>
at least a dozen other examples....
<br>
<p>Your car, alas, is also not a Complex System.  I mean, this was supposed 
<br>
to be a joke, right: you didn't really think it was a complex system?  I 
<br>
assume you are still thinking about a serious reply ... one that doesn't 
<br>
involve any confusion about what a Complex system or a Chaotic system 
<br>
really is?
<br>
<p>Is there anyone else on the list who has the energy and knowledge to 
<br>
write out a clear but concise description of the differences between 
<br>
Complex Systems, Chaotic systems and plain old 'complicated' systems 
<br>
(aka 'complex systems' with a small 'c')?   Something that we could all 
<br>
use as a reference point in this discussion, rather than as a bone of 
<br>
contention?
<br>
<p>I would do this myself (and I will if no one steps forward), but I seem 
<br>
to be a lightning rod for spurious attacks, so it might be better if 
<br>
someone else volunteered. :-)
