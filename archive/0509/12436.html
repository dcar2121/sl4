<br>
<p>A good, short summary of criteria for viral ideas, from somebody quite
<br>
well-known the internet marketing field. How do we score in these criteria,
<br>
specially in the curret, hyperdense cultural field?
<br>
<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/what_makes_an_i.html">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/09/what_makes_an_i.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes an idea viral?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an idea to spread, it needs to be sent and received.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one &quot;sends&quot; an idea unless:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. they understand it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. they want it to spread
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. they believe that spreading it will enhance their power (reputation,
<br>
income,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friendships) or their peace of mind
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. the effort necessary to send the idea is less than the benefits
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one &quot;gets&quot; an idea unless:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. the first impression demands further investigation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. they already understand the foundation ideas necessary to get the new
<br>
idea
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. they trust or respect the sender enough to invest the time
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This explains why online ideas spread so fast but why they're often
<br>
shallow. Nietzsche is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard to understand and risky to spread, so it moves slowly among people
<br>
willing to invest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time. Numa Numa, on the other hand, spread like a toxic waste spill
<br>
because it was so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent, reasonably funny and easy to share.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that ideas never spread because they are important to the
<br>
originator.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice too that a key dynamic in the spread of the idea is the capsule
<br>
that contains it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it's easy to swallow, tempting and complete, it's a lot more likely
<br>
to get a good
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that doesn't mean that there's no role for mystery or ideas that
<br>
unfold over time. In
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact, the unmeasurable variable here is style. Howard Dean's ideas
<br>
spread at the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning--not because of the economic ramifications of his immigration
<br>
policy, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the factors above. The way they were presented fit into the
<br>
worldview of those
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that spread them.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key element in the spread of ideas is their visual element. iPods and
<br>
visual styles
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spread faster in the real world than ephemeral concepts. Pictures and
<br>
short jokes spread
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faster online because the investment necessary to figure out if they're
<br>
worth spreading
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is so tiny.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of course, plenty of bad ideas spread. Panic, for instance, is a
<br>
superbad idea at all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times, but it spreads faster than most. That's because spreading an idea
<br>
is rarely a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughtful, voluntary act. Instead, it is near the core of who we are,
<br>
and we often do it
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without thinking much about the implications.
