<p>This is at odds with both my experience of software engineering and
<br>
more importantly my model of what is necessary and sufficient for
<br>
seed AI. In particular you appear to be using 'large commercial
<br>
software engineering project' as the basis for your model of
<br>
'successful AGI development project', wheras I would now say that 
<br>
while AGI development requires software engineering expertise it
<br>
doesn't conform to the software engineering project model. Assuming
<br>
that you hold this opinion for the same reasons that I used to hold
<br>
it, I doubt we're going to come to any agreement on this point.

<p>Frankly I wish that were true, as it would remove one-man projects
<br>
from consideration as existential risks, but unfortunately while
<br>
the probability of a single person doing everything is low it is
<br>
still nontrivial when aggregated over all lone researchers.
<br>
Clearly some people on this list (who are actually trying to build
<br>
AGIs on their own) would assign a rather higher probability to
<br>
this than I would. Again the discrepancy here is caused by a
<br>
yawning gulf between our models of what kinds of seed AI could
<br>
be built, and I don't expect a useful debate on this point when
<br>
there is no consensus on the prerequisite assumptions.
