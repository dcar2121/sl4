<em>&gt; I will now describe it briefly...
</em><br>
<p>Although this isn't what I meant (I'd call this 'development
<br>
methodology'), it is an interesting area.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For the next phase of the Novamente project it is as follows.  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connecting Novamente to a 3D simulation world called AGI-SIM, where it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controls a little agent that moves around and sees and does stuff. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have then identifies a series of progressively more and more complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasks for Novamente to carry out in this environment, based loosely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Piaget's theory of cognitive development.
</em><br>
<p>I am doing something broadly similar myself with my prototype (which
<br>
isn't intended to be the basis for an AGI, merely to demonstrate the
<br>
viability of some SIAI-relevant theory). However at present I am focusing
<br>
on inductive-deductive tasks rather than planning and control tasks, and
<br>
as such I don't have the same level of embodiment nor complete
<br>
consistency of I/O modalities across tasks. So far I have been working
<br>
with 2D environments only.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, our methodology for the next phase is simply to try to get Novamente to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry out these tasks, one by one, in roughly the order we've articulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on Piaget.
</em><br>
<p>I'm ordering by logical difficulty rather than by similarity to human
<br>
cognitive development, since I'm looking primarily at tractability of
<br>
various kinds of complex but fairly transparent hypothesis generation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If we succeed, we should have an &quot;artificial child&quot; of a sort that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate using complex if not humanlike English and that can solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commonsense reasoning problems, posed in the context of its world, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of an average 10-year-old.
</em><br>
<p>What do you make of the AAII group's 'animal-level cognition first'
<br>
manifesto? Do you already have this, or do you think it's irrelevant
<br>
or skippable (my position is that it's the wrong way of approaching
<br>
the generation of a relevant competence set)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe there is a strong argument that the step from this kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of artificial child to a superhuman AI is not as big as the step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from right here, right now to the artificial child.
</em><br>
<p>That argument depends on the opacity of the design. Using more brute
<br>
force and emergence lowers the design complexity bar for producing
<br>
an AGI, at the cost of making self-improvement much harder due to
<br>
the difficultly or total lack of deliberative self-modification (and
<br>
incidentally making it a UFAI and hence an extincion event).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The big error to ward off in this kind of approach is overfitting: one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't want to make a system that fulfills the exact goals one has laid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out by somehow &quot;cheating&quot; and being able to do essentially nothing but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfill those goals.
</em><br>
<p>Now I can just enter the relevant hypotheses to solve the problem
<br>
directly, and then progressively switch to less and less direct
<br>
specification in a kind of constraint generalisation. Overfitting isn't
<br>
(generally) a problem when you know how the 'fitting' mechanisms will
<br>
perform and can see immediately how closely the generated model and
<br>
planning metamodel matches the world and task. Though again direct
<br>
comparison is a bit unfair as I'm not working on AGI proper; right now
<br>
I couldn't directly oppose a claim that your system is a better
<br>
compromise between generality and tractability.
