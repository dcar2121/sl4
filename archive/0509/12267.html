<p>If all attractors were bad, that might be true. I am claiming
<br>
that many of the attractor in the cognitive structure space are
<br>
also local or global optima in reasoning performance, and that
<br>
we should aim to start already in such an attractor (one that
<br>
stably implements Friendliness). There may well still be a role
<br>
for the kind of pattern recognition that one uses to categorise
<br>
'emergent' behaviour in internal performance optimisation, but
<br>
this is an issue of optimising content (specifically, metadata
<br>
on content), not optimising structure. I'm not going to try
<br>
and prove that claim at this time, but I reserve the right to
<br>
poke holes in any attempts to disprove it, and to make the point
<br>
that if it /can/ be done, then it /should/ be done (because
<br>
reliable Friendliness is the ultimate goal).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; trying to use raw probability theory for high level cognition would

</em><br>
<p>Thousands of researchers seem to be convinced that classic symbolic
<br>
AI /is/ the way to AGI. While this might be 'crazy' in the absolute
<br>
sense, I would consider it the unfortunate result of the misleading
<br>
intuitive notions built into human introspection, and thus I wouldn't
<br>
say that they're any less sane than the average human. Of course you
<br>
may just be being colloquial. Regardless, it would certainly be
<br>
'short-sighted', 'silly' and possibly 'ignorant'.

</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with that assertion either. I suspect that the majority
<br>
of the design space will self-modify towards stable rather than
<br>
cyclical attractors, particularly those attractors which are good
<br>
approximations of true normative reasoning, but this relies on personal
<br>
assumptions which I have not proved and is beside the point. The actual
<br>
point is that it's as silly for me to make an outright claim that 'no
<br>
emergent design will ever survive self-modification' as it is for
<br>
Loosemore to claim that 'no Bayesian design will ever survive self
<br>
modification'.
