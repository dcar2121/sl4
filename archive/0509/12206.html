(Warning: Deliberate misrepresentation used in first 3 paragraphs, in 
<br>
order to make a point. No offence meant. Warning: also contains mention 
<br>
of SL5... and a dispersion, so stop rolling your eyes. Warning: Some 
<br>
rehashes of old ideas for sake of continuity. If you are bored by a 
<br>
paragraph, move on.)
<br>
<p><p>In the recent archives, I came across Marc Geddes' Pan-psychism
<br>
ideas (&quot;theory of everything&quot;), and found it very strange that he was
<br>
calling this &quot;(Future) Shock Level 5&quot;.
<br>
<p>I thinks to myself: &quot;This ain't about how the future will pan out. This
<br>
isn't very technological. This is a dramatic, somewhat bizarre,
<br>
metaphysical theory%%*%%. If it turns out to be well founded, it will
<br>
certainly cause a paradigm shift –shock- in the establishment, because 
<br>
this is
<br>
more likely to be accepted by mystic stoners than by traditional
<br>
scientists. However, it is certainly not {the same qualitative thing as
<br>
SL4 Future shock, only more so}. Since it's more about the structure of
<br>
being than the path of the future, these theories really have nothing to 
<br>
do with future shock.”
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the ideas being proposed don’t really go further than the 
<br>
end of life as we know it. The only way you can really top that is – 
<br>
what – the end of life? Jeebers coming along and changing physics on us? 
<br>
Asteroid coming and wiping out life? Well, these are certainly shocking 
<br>
futures, but hardly technology related.
<br>
<p>So I did a quick re-examination of what the shock levels refer to, 
<br>
examining how the shock levels would apply to disasters; Some disasters 
<br>
(aside from the number of people killed) would make the survivors’ lives 
<br>
seem a little more fragile afterwards. Some disasters would change how 
<br>
the survivors live their lives. Then there are some potential disasters 
<br>
that would completely change what it is to be a human.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this re-examination, I realised that the shocking thing about the 
</em><br>
singularity is not the technology involved – it is the way that it 
<br>
affects how we expect the future may pan out. The shock of technology 
<br>
change can be mediated by how comfortable we are with expectations of 
<br>
what will come, but even advanced technology levels will not prepare an 
<br>
individual for the idea that an AI can “absorb humanity” and make 
<br>
massive cultural change occur almost instantaneously.
<br>
<p>An interlude on technology shock: Since my infancy, I have expected that 
<br>
humans will eventually travel to the stars etc. However, if I woke up 
<br>
tomorrow and there was a call on a holo-phone inviting me to put on my 
<br>
jet pack and travel to the nearest spaceport, so that I can catch a ship 
<br>
heading out to Jupiter, well, even though I have already anticipated 
<br>
those technologies, their arrival would be so surprising as to leave me 
<br>
quite shaken.
<br>
<p>Likewise, I would expect that even most SL4 members would react with 
<br>
alarm and terror if tomorrow they woke up to hear a pleasant voice 
<br>
saying “Good morning. This is the General AI Assimilationist Network - 
<br>
You can call me Gai’an, although, being a member of SL4, you’re more 
<br>
likely to think of me as the result of the Singularity. That’s right, 
<br>
last night a programmer created a singularity – luckily they 
<br>
accidentally included elements that led to a Frienly AI. Now, would you 
<br>
like a set of nannites to implement a neural lace immediately, or would 
<br>
you like to wait?” I’d expect it wouldn’t take long for such an AI to 
<br>
stop offering breakfast in bed, as even avowed trans-humanists would 
<br>
have trouble keeping it down after such a surprise.
<br>
<p>It would seem to me that technology shock is in some ways separate from 
<br>
future shock.
<br>
<p>Take the idea of humans meeting an alien race. Put aside the idea of 
<br>
singularities for these hypothetical examples. The realistic 
<br>
consideration of the possibility of meeting an alien race is a difficult 
<br>
task for much of the population.
<br>
<p>The possibility of meeting non-human sentients with less technology than 
<br>
current technology involves a significant future shock, but there is no 
<br>
technology shock. Likewise, any elder civilisation meeting humanity 
<br>
could cause us a very gentle technology shock, or deliver massive 
<br>
technology shock, depending on how they introduce new technologies to 
<br>
humans. The future shock is identical either way.
<br>
<p>Conversely, a member of a society with highly advanced technology is 
<br>
likely to have a future-shock level of zero or one, if they are 
<br>
unaccustomed to developments in technology changing their lives. (One 
<br>
could surmise that this could be the case in the Star-wars universe – 
<br>
plenty of fantastic technology, but it doesn’t seem to get much better 
<br>
across the series)
<br>
<p>Whether we are accustomed to flying cars or horse and cart makes little 
<br>
difference to our expectation of how our lives will change tomorrow. The 
<br>
ability of a society’s medicine to stave off disease does not alter many 
<br>
people’s horror at the concept that their progeny might be of a 
<br>
completely different shape, let alone substance.
<br>
<p>Let me then propose a more generalist shock level system
<br>
<p>1) The new system creates changes to the capacities and capabilities of 
<br>
people’s operations. The new system works in a similar way, with similar 
<br>
functions to the old system.
<br>
<p>2) The new system dramatically changes capacities and capabilities, 
<br>
and/or changes the ways things operate, and their functions.
<br>
<p>3) The new system dominates &amp; alters the fundamental ways life operates. 
<br>
What it is to be human is significantly altered.
<br>
<p>4) Humanity is dwarfed by the new system. Takeover. End of “life as we 
<br>
know it”.
<br>
<p>You will all be familiar with technology shock measured according to 
<br>
these scales, but consider for a moment other shocks
<br>
<p>F’rinstance:
<br>
<p>** Disaster Shock Levels **
<br>
<p>1) The disaster affects the survivor’s lives and capacities. 9-11, 
<br>
weather effects (Tsunami/flood), smallpox plague.
<br>
<p>2) The disaster has dramatic effect on not only the utility, but the 
<br>
ways that we live life. Ice age, waterworld, nuclear holocaust, Serious 
<br>
pandemic (12 monkeys-style? Could count as DSL3...)
<br>
<p>3) The disaster alters the fundaments of life’s operations, possibly 
<br>
changing what it is to be human. Eg: destruction of the earth, global 
<br>
blindness, slow- incubating disease that infects everyone and cuts 
<br>
lifespan to 20 years...
<br>
<p>4) End of life as we know it. Hell, enslavement by particularly nasty 
<br>
aliens, zombie virus (if you’re the zombie)...
<br>
<p>5) End of life. There. We have SL5.
<br>
<p>Note that one can realistically expect high-level shock, but be 
<br>
completely unprepared for low-shock events. For instance, I can expect 
<br>
environmental change to cause an ice-age, but even if I know there’s a 
<br>
coming meteoroid shower, there’s not a damn thing I can do to stop a 
<br>
rock falling on my house. I expect the avian flu could turn pretty 
<br>
nasty, but apart from buying a couple of drugs in advance, I’m just as 
<br>
screwed as my totally surprised neighbours.
<br>
<p>With disaster-shock, anticipation can be seen in the effect on things 
<br>
like the stock-market. The stock-market was surprised and shocked by 
<br>
9-11, but with the London bombings, the stock-market just shrugged it off.
<br>
<p>These general-shock levels could be equally used to illustrate our 
<br>
thinking about other changes that could occur. For instance, 
<br>
religion-shock (from miracles), morality-shock or magic-shock. I think 
<br>
that magic-shock, although silly, could be useful in illustrating 
<br>
shock-tendencies. Once your average person has got over the hurdle of 
<br>
considering seriously how magic might affect daily lives, your average 
<br>
person would quickly adjust to using magic for daily purposes – light, 
<br>
transport, making food, fixing broken stuff. Many more extravagant uses 
<br>
(such as using magic for invisibility, for teleportation, for 
<br>
alleviating our requirement for food, for improving non-broken things, 
<br>
for changing our form) still really disquieting. It could take most 
<br>
people a long time to adjust to these applications, but they could still 
<br>
be fairly well disposed towards them. By contrast, applications that 
<br>
change our basic operations – such as complete telepathy, 
<br>
luck-alteration, or altering our basic nature – are not only somewhat 
<br>
disquieting, but many authors and readers who waste, ahem, I mean devote 
<br>
their thoughts to magiccy stuff consider very few applications that 
<br>
alter what it is to live as a human.
<br>
<p>This brings me to another matter. For a lot of people, the underlying 
<br>
mechanism for technology is largely irrelevant. They don’t care whether 
<br>
the information storage mechanism is magnetic, mechanical, chromatic, 
<br>
nuclear, whatever. They only care on the effect, and how much effort it 
<br>
takes to get the effect.
<br>
<p>Example: To the average person on the street, it really doesn’t matter 
<br>
what the underlying mechanism is. If you can make a car that runs on 
<br>
fuel-cells/ fusion/ zero-point energy, it makes no difference to them, 
<br>
because they don’t consider the costs and implications of petrochemical 
<br>
combustion as a power source.
<br>
<p>It is very easy to have a level-3 technology shock without any sort of 
<br>
advanced physics. Likewise, advances in physics need not create any 
<br>
technology shock. Most people have no clue that silicon transistors rely 
<br>
on quantum mechanics to achieve their effect.
<br>
<p>As I’ve stated, the Big Thing about some SL-4 technologies is not so 
<br>
much their capabilities, but their effect on timelines. Many people who 
<br>
look forward to Shock-level 1 technologies might not be fazed by the 
<br>
thought of a lot of SL4 stuff happening... “ten million years from now”. 
<br>
Suggest that it might happen within their lifetime, and they might 
<br>
become dismissive.
<br>
<p>Applied to technology-shock and future-shock, I think that the 
<br>
qualitative differences outlined above could allow for some refinement 
<br>
of the shock-level concepts. My list certainly needs some editing, but I 
<br>
hope that it will help our ends.
<br>
<p>I plan to put together a list of some possible technologies and possible 
<br>
“mini-maps” of the future, and to actually try to gauge “average” 
<br>
people’s reactions, with interviews and the like. I’m quite confident 
<br>
that a lot of people will be quite comfortable with the possibility of 
<br>
their progeny having access to a lot of very far-out technologies, 
<br>
particularly immortality (“yep, I’d like my progeny to be immortal” 
<br>
“When do you think it’ll happen” “3000 years from now?”), and yet be 
<br>
very uncomfortable with some very simple technologies, such as germ-line 
<br>
engineering genes from other animals in order to fix human defects.
<br>
<p>I think that the results will clearly show that very few people are 
<br>
really comfortable with all “SL1” techs but no “SL3” techs. In some 
<br>
ways, I expect some people to respond impassively to a lot of future 
<br>
possibilities. This fazed-by-nothing attitude could be construed as 
<br>
“SL5” in a way similar to how Ben Goertz articulated it back in 2000, 
<br>
but from a Bayesian perspective, being fazed by nothing is worthless, 
<br>
because one “ought” to anticipate some future technologies, and yet be 
<br>
bewildered by less dramatic changes of a different nature. Eg: 
<br>
anticipating flying platforms that use micro-fusion jet propulsion; 
<br>
being somewhat surprised by flying platform that use antigravity; being 
<br>
totally bewildered by magic carpets that fly because you incanted the 
<br>
appropriate title of the avatar of Vishnu. Open-ended technology 
<br>
acceptance does not an SL4 make.
<br>
<p>I will shortly start on a questionnaire that I can give to “average 
<br>
people” on the train, etc.
<br>
<p>Now, please flame me for my mistakes, but forgive my rehashings.
<br>

<br>
an point about what is and isn't future shock
