<p>You have me hoist by my own petard there.  :-)
<br>
<p>My first thought is that they are a bit of a peculiar case of a CAS, 
<br>
almost too simple to be intersting.  For example, when you set off a 
<br>
cellular automaton like Conway's Life, you have give it some initial 
<br>
data or it sits there, lifeless.  Then, we observe regularities in the 
<br>
course of many, many runs with different data.  (Wolfram did this a 
<br>
great deal, if I recall correctly).  But the regularities we observe are 
<br>
of a fairly simple nature.
<br>
<p>I would almost say that CA are a class of CAS by themselves.
<br>
<p>And to be sure, there are all sorts of other things that show emergent 
<br>
behavior without the adaptive component (the sand piles beloved of Per Bak).
<br>
<p>So I would revise my position:  yes, you can get different kinds of 
<br>
complexity occurring under a range of conditions, even when there is not 
<br>
adaptation.  But some of those emergent regularities are fairly minor, 
<br>
and I was overlooking them.  For example, Hofstadter tells the story of 
<br>
the multiuser computer system that became horribly slow after a critical 
<br>
number of users logged on, but was fine below that number (somebody 
<br>
suggested curing the problem by swapping all occurrences of the critical 
<br>
number, inside the OS, with a number ten times as big).  That critical 
<br>
number was an emergent (or at least a non-localized) property of the 
<br>
system, but from my point of view that kind of emergence is small 
<br>
potatoes, so I was neglecting it.
