<p>In my work as a software engineer, I've become convinced
<br>
there really isn't such a thing as software engineering.
<br>
<p>That is, in normal engineering we know exactly how the
<br>
different components are supposed to fit together, but
<br>
when building software we always need to invent ways of
<br>
putting things together and cannot often rely on known
<br>
methods.
<br>
<p>Going to Mars is mostly an engineering problem, creating
<br>
the seed AI needed for the Singularity is hard science,
<br>
with many untested theories and unanswered questions.
<br>
<p>Because of this (and the fact that software development
<br>
almost never finishes on schedule) I think it is quite
<br>
possible that people will live on Mars before we have
<br>
created the Singularity.
