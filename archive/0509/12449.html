<em>&gt;You know where this would really be effective? If you held a symposium on

<p>Some of us are running as fast as we can. I suspect I posted this link only 
<br>
to the extropian list and not here:

<p>The idea is out there; arguably, it's *the* idea in print sf right now...
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.analogsf.com/0511/reflib_11.shtml">http://www.analogsf.com/0511/reflib_11.shtml</a> :
<br>
<p>&lt; Charles Stross does love the cornucopian vision of the future promised by 
<br>
the nanotechnology enthusiasts and their dreams of assemblers, utility fog, 
<br>
programmable matter, artificial intelligence, mental uploads and downloads, 
<br>
and the Great Singularity or Spike looming in the perhaps-not-too-distant 
<br>
future. The basic idea is a shift from an economy of scarcity (today’s 
<br>
economy) to one of abundance. How will we make a living? No problem, for 
<br>
living and a great many trimmings besides are free. How do we find value 
<br>
for our lives? That will take some discovering, but some people have 
<br>
already begun to search...
<br>
<p>Those of us who read SF have heard of nanotechnology, artificial 
<br>
intelligence, robots, silicon adjuncts to the brain that let people control 
<br>
prosthetic limbs or machinery, mental up- and downloads, memory boosters, 
<br>
life extension, post-humans, transhumanism, and the Singularity or Spike. 
<br>
If we also read the science news (Technology Review, Scientific American, 
<br>
New Scientist, and the like), we know that much of what we are accustomed 
<br>
to seeing in fiction exists in embryo already. It’s in the lab, or even in 
<br>
commercial prototype. But it’s not in a store near you­yet!
<br>
<p>Most of the rest of the world hasn’t a clue, for the stuff that fascinates 
<br>
us tends not to get into the daily news until it is a lot closer to the 
<br>
store. These are the people who will pick up journalist and futurist Joel 
<br>
Garreau’s
