I concur it would not be entirely wise (or feasible) to broadcast singularity 
<br>
memes at a thoroughly mainstream level. If we did, however, I would expect the 
<br>
backlash to level out against a groundswell of grassroots support within five 
<br>
years. So if Garreau's or Kurzweil's books, or other communicative efforts, 
<br>
were to penetrate CNN discussion groups in the near future, we could expect 
<br>
that by 2010 a lot of people who hear of the Singularity in highschool and 
<br>
college will be very conscientous of it as they chose their career paths. It 
<br>
would be interesting to conjecture the odds of the Bush administration 
<br>
commisioning a government agency devoted to banning singularity tech.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important thing to consider is that vestiges of transhumanism and 
<br>
Singularity awareness have been scattered throughout popular culture since at 
<br>
least the ninteen sixties. 2001: A Space Odyssey introduced the idea of man 
<br>
using technology to make an evolutionary leap while post-modernism 
<br>
subsequently spread the notion that the &quot;human condition&quot; is really a 
<br>
configuration of data which evolves with our technology. Generation X grew up 
<br>
in the wake of these memes, while generation Y literally spent much of their 
<br>
youth playing videogames or being inundated with hyperreal MTV marketing. 
<br>
Theres a big expanse between running through the streets shouting of 
<br>
techno-apocalypse and sublty moving peoples minds with thoughtful yet 
<br>
entertaining Singularity themed media. The cool thing about pop culture as a 
<br>
venue is that the narrow minded people who are most likely to backlash tend to 
<br>
be filtered out a priori.

<p><em>&gt;===== Original Message From &quot;Stuart, Ian&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Ian.Stuart@woolpert.com?Subject=RE:%20What%20Makes%20An%20Idea%20Viral?%20(Seth%20Godin)">Ian.Stuart@woolpert.com</a>&gt; =====
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Why would we want to evangelize for singularity-related memes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Do we know whether increase social exposure to these ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;would hasten or delay singularity tech?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have to agree. Widespread dispersal of the singularity meme would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;denounced by some, feared by most (think Rapture and end times and see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the statistics for the number of people in the U.S. who think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evolution should be REPLACED by creationism in science classes),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accepted by few, understood by a handful, and actively pursued by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;number I could probably count to in a matter of minutes. I think that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in this particular case, the harm of stirring up the masses in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;random direction far outweighs the good of attracting the few who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;most benefit the cause of bringing about a Friendly Singularity. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fact, I would be very interested to see a breakout of shock level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;populations by country or region and see how the reactions played out in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relation to shock level saturation. For instance, I would venture that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in highly tech-oriented areas of the U.S. (Los Angeles, New York,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Silicon Valley, etc. . .) the reaction would fall primarily towards the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;acceptance/understanding end of the spectrum, whilst here in rural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Kentucky, shock panic and mass hysteria would ensue once the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;populace grasped that the world as they know it is about to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drastically which, knowing the general mindset of my neighbors, is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ONLY conceivable outcome without a serious re-education campaign. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other words, it may be possible to start with today's children and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prepare a majority of them for the concept of a singularity by the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they are 18, but based on the projections that I keep seeing bandied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about, this may not be complete by the time full blown singularity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;upon us.
