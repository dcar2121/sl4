<p>
Richard,
<br>
<p>To an extent I feel you're attacking a straw man in these long emails.
<br>
<p>Basically no one on this list (Stephen Reed of Cycorp may be an
<br>
exception, but I'm not even sure about that, because I'd hesitate to
<br>
identify his own views with those of Doug Lenat) advocates the GOFAI
<br>
approach that denies the importance of symbol grounding.  I think
<br>
all the AI folks on this list agree with you that symbol grounding
<br>
is an important problem and that GOFAI sucks.  We may not agree with
<br>
you (or each other) on the best solution to the symbol grounding
<br>
problem, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The boot, I submit, is on the other foot.  The rest of the community is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking the non-complex AGI folks [apologies for the awkward term:  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sure what to call people who eschew complexity, except perhaps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Old Guard] why *we* should go along with what looks like their blind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith in being able to build a fully capable, grounded AGI without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resorting to complexity.
</em><br>
<p>The boot is on both feet ;-)
<br>
<p>Personally I am happy to entertain ANYONE's viable-sounding, reasonably
<br>
specific ideas about how to make an AGI, whether they involve complexity
<br>
or not.
<br>
<p>I am less interested in generalities about what kind of system an AGI
<br>
should or could be.  Because I don't think we know enough to make
<br>
such generalizations reliably, at this point.
<br>
<p>I think there may be many kinds of possible AGI's, with
<br>
varying degrees of reliance on complex dynamics and emergent
<br>
phenomena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In closing, let me say that I look very negative when presenting this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument, even though I actually do have concrete suggestions for what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should do instead.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I am more curious to hear them than to hear philosophizing about the
<br>
power of complexity ;)
<br>
<p>I have nothing against philosophizing about complexity -- there is a
<br>
chapter on complexity in the philosophy-of-mind-book I'm nearly done
<br>
writing -- but I've heard and done a lot of it already...
<br>
<p>? Right
<br>
<em>&gt; now, my goal is to suggest that here we have an issue of truly enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; importance, and that we should first of all accept that it really is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue, then go on to talk about what can be done about it.  But I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to get to first base first and get people to agree that there is an issue.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that symbol grounding is a key problem in AI, that complexity is
<br>
a key aspect of human intelligence and MAY (or may not) be a necessary
<br>
aspect of AI under limited resources.
<br>
<p>You seem more confident that complexity is a necessary aspect of AI
<br>
but I'm not convinced by your arguments...
<br>
<p>-- Ben
