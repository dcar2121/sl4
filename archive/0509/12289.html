I addressed this in my own follow up which you may or may not have 
<br>
noticed. I wasn't suggesting you could use quantum mechanics to 
<br>
communicate instantly, but rather that you could operate on data over 
<br>
here which is entangled with some data over there being operated on by 
<br>
another process, and know that the two different locations were 
<br>
proceeding from a consistent starting point.
<br>
<p>I might be wrong, but I thought this would bring an advantage, because 
<br>
you could &quot;know&quot; something about the other system, even though it is far 
<br>
away. For example, you could measure your local qubits, and from that 
<br>
know on what basis the distant processing is proceeding on. I don't know 
<br>
whether that's really useful or not, but it might help.
<br>
<p>But I agree that it's a weak point I made, it's certainly not a silver 
<br>
bullet to the problem, just something I was speculating about being 
<br>
useful. Perhaps best left unsaid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If a brain was so large that one region could only produce output that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;would affect another region &quot;tomorrow&quot;, it would be difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;imagine a resulting consciousness which experienced a consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;history, but was able to experience &quot;moments&quot; lasting less than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;time taken to achieve consistency between brain areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One of the basic mechanisms of distributed computing is having every locale
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a consistent view of history, even if it is on a different point of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;timeline than other locales in some absolute context.  The mark of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generally effective distributed processing system is that if you turned off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all external input there is a very high probability that it would eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;settle into a globally consistent state.  It is worth pointing out that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;databases like Oracle or PostgreSQL do exactly this as well to guarantee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correctness on single processors with high-concurrency (virtual parallelism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and an extremely high probability of correctness.  The modern Multi-Version
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Concurrency Control (MVCC) family of algorithms is a distributed processing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;algorithm designed to approximately guarantee eventual global consistency
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even in single address spaces, never mind networked systems.  And in fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;databases do give every user a consistent tidy view of the database, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;often two different users will have different inconsistent views that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nonetheless internally consistent for each user.  As is in evidence, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually works out very well in practice despite the fact that different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;views in the system are operating on different points in the database's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For many purposes, significant synchronization latencies will not impact the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct functioning or consistency of the overall system as viewed from any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given point in the system.  However, synchronization latencies will impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the overall throughput and intelligence of the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Interesting ... What about the system's awareness of itself? Just from 
<br>
introspection, it doesn't seem like my consciousness is seated in 
<br>
anything more locationally precise than &quot;my brain&quot;. Bits of my brain 
<br>
variously inform my consciousness to a greater or lesser extent, but I'm 
<br>
not sure that's what you are talking about.
<br>
<p>If a brain were so large that a globally consistent self-awareness were 
<br>
not possible, what might happen? Either the self-awareness would 
<br>
&quot;ignore&quot; inconsistencies -- i.e. wouldn't notice things that happened in 
<br>
smaller time-frames than the time it takes to settle into a reasonably 
<br>
consistent stage, or the self-awareness wouldn't be global 
<br>
self-awareness, or there would be multiple consciousnesses emerging from 
<br>
the same brain.
<br>
<p>I really like your discussion about setting to a globally consistent 
<br>
state, and the example of a very complex database. In your example, you 
<br>
talk about locally consistent views of the database. To continue the 
<br>
analogy with a brain, what do these locally consistent views represent?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
