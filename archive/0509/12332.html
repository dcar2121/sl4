Michael,
<br>
<p>I assumed that most people on this list would not be trapped into any of 
<br>
the routine misunderstandings that you mention:  I certainly wasn't.
<br>
<p>My argument hinged on the significance of the word &quot;may&quot; in your 
<br>
statement &quot;... AIs may implement logical inference as a low-level 
<br>
mechanism ...&quot;.
<br>
<p>In my post on the relevance of complex systems, I set out the reasons 
<br>
why it is extremely questionable to assume that anyone can build a valid 
<br>
AGI by starting with the observation of logical reasoning at the 
<br>
extremely high level the we know it, then using this as the basis for 
<br>
the lowest level mechanisms of an AGI.
<br>
<p>So far, I there has not been one coherent response to the central point 
<br>
that I made in that post and my subsequent follow up.  Most responders, 
<br>
and especially yourself and Eliezer, used &quot;complex system&quot; to refer to 
<br>
things that were not, in fact complex systems at all, thus rendering 
<br>
their comments irrelevant.

<em>&gt; Something is seriously broken if you think that probability theory is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind one as sophisticated as genetics. On the contrary, probability

</em><br>
<em>&gt; human applying probability theory /is/ fabulously complex, but this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need not be true for an AI, as I will detail below;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Real thinking systems, in practice, obviously cope with the task of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure that you have a clear idea of how advocates of rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition are proposing that mechanisms be layered. I have often shot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down armchair critics of AI for confusing the fact that humans implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical inference as a high level, symbolic process (supported by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounded concepts and all sorts of complex lower-level mechanisms),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while AIs may implement logical inference as a low-level mechanism (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed, all AIs on current hardware are ultimately based on boolean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic). I'm not certain, but it looks like you're making the same kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of mistake; an AI can support 'irrational'/'fuzzy'/'intuitive' sorts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition as a layer above a logical substrate, and then possibly even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another layer of high-level logical inference above that. Your criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would apply if probability theory was being used the way humans use it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a layer above concepts, grounding etc, or the way that GOFAI might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use it, i.e. on its own without any of the other necessary complexity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is inapplicable as a criticism of Bayes as the underlying basis
</em><br>

</em><br>
