Hi Jeff,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ben replied, &quot;Yes, an observation of a non-black raven TOGETHER WITH
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SPECIAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE SITUATION can yield evidence toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothesis that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravens are black.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But in the absence of explicitly stated special assumptions, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a non-black non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all ravens are black.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only assumption required is that our sample space is finite.
</em><br>
<p>This isn't true.
<br>
<p>Suppose you have a population of 10 birds of different colors, and no other
<br>
knowledge about the population.
<br>
<p>If you sample one of the birds and find that it's a purple goose, why does
<br>
this count as information that all the RAVENS in the population are black?
<br>
<p>This would be true only if there were additional information of some sort...
<br>
<p>For instance, if it's believed that geese are generally similar to ravens,
<br>
then a purple goose provides a limited amount of speculative evidence that
<br>
purple ravens exist; and, given a finite population, this is speculative
<br>
evidence against the existence of black ravens ... it decrements the
<br>
estimated probability of ravens being black.
<br>
<p>But, this inference requires an additional assumption, it's not implicit in
<br>
the original problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can modify Eli's earlier example to demonstrate:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given a set of M ravens and N non-ravens, we randomly sample a raven
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and find that it is black. As the number of times we repeat this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases, it becomes asymptotically certain that all ravens are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black, as compared to the hypothesis that a positive non-zero integer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of ravens are non-black. Taking the limit as the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravens goes to infinity, the evidence provided by sampling a raven and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding it is black for [all ravens are black] approaches zero.
</em><br>
<p>All this is correct, of course.  But it has nothing to do with Hempel's
<br>
paradox of confirmation...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Considering you don't take this as a proper criticism of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; informal/colloquial assertion that [observing a black raven should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for the claim that all ravens are black], it cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deployed in defense of your claim that [observing a non-black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravens are black]. It does provide evidence, and it should. Hempel's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravens peck no holes in Bayesian philosophy of science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hempel's paradox is not a paradox at all; it was a confusion based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lack of knowledge on the part of humans. The evidential situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed was counterintuitive, yes. But that's just yet another reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for researchers to stop letting their intuitions overrule the math (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, as the case may be).
</em><br>
<p>All math and science paradoxes are paradoxical only in the context of overly
<br>
limiting formal or conceptual systems.
<br>
<p>For instance, Epiminides' paradox (&quot;This sentence is false&quot;) is problematic
<br>
in some formal systems but is fine in G. Spencer-Brown's &quot;imaginary logic&quot;
<br>
or in logic based on Aczel-style non-foundational set theory.
<br>
<p>Hempel's paradox is problematic in some formal models of evidence and not
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>I agree that &quot;Bayesian philosophy of science&quot; deals with Hempel's ravens in
<br>
an internally consistent way, but not that it deals with them in a
<br>
conceptually adequate way.
<br>
<p>-- Ben
