<p>It's my understanding that fusion weapons, which
<br>
get almost all their power from the
<br>
deuterium/tritium hydrogen isotopes, go 'stale'
<br>
as these isotopes decay after decades of storage.
<br>
This is one of the things that keep places like
<br>
Hanford open, to make more deuterium/tritium.
<br>
Presumably the same applies to the uranium or
<br>
plutonium which serves to start the fusion,
<br>
though it may take longer (IANAphysicist).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Get off the nuclear weapons fixation already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It is a relatively minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threat to your survival -- you are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be killed by a nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; virus than a nuke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How bad does a virus need to be to have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same effect on the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy as a nuclear exchange?
</em><br>
<p>I have long believed that one of the factors
<br>
preventing a nuclear exchange in the Cold War was
<br>
that, far from being 'unthinkable,' it was
<br>
actually very thinkable, very easy to envision.
<br>
Your city goes boom, everything is toast. Other
<br>
things, just as dangerous in a much slower time
<br>
scale, don't get people's attention, because
<br>
there's no sudden boom. For instance, there's an
<br>
alien sea plant taking over the Mediterranean,
<br>
and fish can't eat it.
<br>

<br>
<p>As for the economic effects of a nuclear
<br>
exchange, there are aspects that are unique to a
<br>
nuke attack, especially the electromagnetic
<br>
pulse. That alone (even if the people and
<br>
buildings were unharmed) would be very disruptive
<br>
in such a technologically dependent society as
<br>
ours. Multiply Katrina by a hundred cities, and
<br>
you have  an indication.
