What is the difference between something that is &quot;an unpredictable emergent 
<br>
phenomena&quot; and something that is &quot;random&quot;
<br>
<p>Either one can be a part of a &quot;complex system&quot; -- and could also be part of 
<br>
any &quot;complex emergent system&quot; or a &quot;dynamic complex emergent system&quot;. It 
<br>
seems to me that the only difference between the two arguments is that one 
<br>
is saying that in order for intelligence to be tractable some random 
<br>
variable must be used.
<br>
<p>To say that Friendliness is mathematically unlikely to be verified only 
<br>
means that there is &quot;some random variable&quot; which can either cause the 
<br>
intelligent system to be Friendly or not- and that it is unlikely that we 
<br>
can determine the Friendliness of the system because there is randomness in 
<br>
the system. If there is no randomness in the system, then 
<br>
Friendliness-verification isn't a question of probability, but of motivation 
<br>
to actually verify it.
<br>
<p>I think it's a valid argument to say that randomness is necessary for 
<br>
tractability (although randomness would definitely be sub-optimal as 
<br>
compared to determinism), however I think it would be presumptous to say 
<br>
that intelligence requires randomness just because intelligent systems are 
<br>
really complex and confusing.
<br>
<p>complex != random
<br>
emergent + complex != random
<br>
emergent + complex + dynamic != random
<br>
<p>actually, ONLY:
<br>
random = random

<em>&gt;Subject: Is complex emergence necessary for intelligence under limited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resources?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Mon, 19 Sep 2005 10:54:21 -0400
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Richard,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The answers that others offer to your questions are, pretty much:  no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you cannot really avoid complex systems, and mathematical verification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of their friendliness is the very last thing you would be able to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The main defining characteristic of complex systems is that such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mathematical verification is out of reach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is no question that human mind/brain is a complex system which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieves its intelligence via emergence, self-organization, strange
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attractors, terminal attractors, and all that great stuff....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And there is little question that emergence-based intelligence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intrinsically very difficult to predict and control with a high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;degree of reliability, thus rendering verified Friendliness an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unlikely outcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, these observations don't tell you much about whether it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible to use digital computers to create an intelligence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DOESN'T rely critically on the emergent phenomena typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;associated with biological complex dynamical systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Semi-similarly, the human mind/brain probably uses complex emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phenomena to add 2+2 and get 4, but, a calculator doesn't, and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculator does a better job of arithmetic anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One may argue that flexible, creative intelligence is fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different than arithmetic, and is not achievable within limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computational resources except via complex, unpredictable emergent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dynamics.  In fact I strongly SUSPECT this is true, but I haven't SHOWN
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that it's true in a convincing way, and I'm not 100% convinced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you have a strong argument why this contention is true, I'd be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very eager to hear it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other hand, some others seems pretty sure that the opposite is true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and that it IS possible to achieve powerful intelligence under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limited resources without requiring unpredictable emergent phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, I haven't seen any strong arguments in this direction either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
