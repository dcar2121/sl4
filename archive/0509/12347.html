</em><br>
<p>This isn't what I'm proposing and I don't think it's what Ben is
<br>
proposing either. I am proposing that the 'symbol engine' is implemented
<br>
and processed using the 'logic engine' (though I haven't 'symbols' in
<br>
the fuzzy sense for some time; the term is misleading); they are not
<br>
seperate, the 'logic engine' doesn't need to 'access' the 'symbol engine'
<br>
because it is running the 'symbol engine', and the 'symbol engine'
<br>
doesn't have to go through hoops to 'access' the logic engine because
<br>
the relevant logical operations are available as cognitive primitives.
<br>
I do not have a good understanding of Ben's design, but I get the
<br>
impression that though he does have seperate logical inference and
<br>
'emergence-promoting' (e.g. GAs) mechanisms, they do not constitute
<br>
well-seperated modules, but instead form the basis of agents in something
<br>
like an extremely distributed, adaptive topology blackboard architecture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If that basic-substrate logic engine were to interact with the symbols 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created by the symbol engine, how would it do it?
</em><br>
<p>Were you to do this, the 'basic-substrate' logic engine would act like
<br>
a 'logic modality'. Logical systems would be imagery in the 'logic
<br>
modality', and logical operations would be opaque imagery transforms.
<br>
In a system with such a crufty 'symbol engine', presumably this would
<br>
be a relatively efficient way to apply brute-force logical deductive
<br>
power. For an AI with a logic modality, complex 100-step proofs may
<br>
seem as obvious once the axioms are defined as the question of whether
<br>
a tennis ball will fit through a donut is to a human with a visual
<br>
modality. An integrated design can achieve the effects of a 'logic
<br>
modality' via reflection, if it needs to at all.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Let's overlook the deficiencies of connectionism (aka Neural Nets) for a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment and push my previous example a little further.
</em><br>
<p>Your description appears to match that of the 'hybrid systems' subfield
<br>
of AI, which in a well-meaning but misguided attempt at synthesis
<br>
advocates combing symbolic and connectionist approaches as the answer
<br>
to AI's problems. This mostly means the crude gluing together of a
<br>
production system 'central cognition' engine and NN input/output
<br>
processors, though there has been some more interesting work done on
<br>
systems that use two-way NN/rule-set conversion and which combine NNs
<br>
and production systems in an agent network. Regardless, it still doesn't
<br>
work and is based on the fundamentally flawed approach of gluing things
<br>
together without understanding why the component techniques didn't
<br>
work on their own, how the combination will rectify the flaws, or indeed
<br>
in most cases the end-to-end functional mechanisms the overall system is
<br>
supposed to implement.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; This would be difficult or impossible, because there is no way for you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to impose a new symbol on the symbol engine; the symbols emerge, so to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a new one you have to set up the right pattern of connections
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across a big chunk of network, you can't just write another symbol to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory the way you would in a conventional system.
</em><br>
<p>This is actually less difficult than you might think. I find it highly
<br>
amusing that while connectionists are aweing themselves with the opacity
<br>
and inscrutability of their own networks, as if that was an /advantage/,
<br>
other researchers are demonstrating how NNs operate as function
<br>
approximators and how compact symbolic rule sets can be mined from
<br>
trained NNs (admittadly at some information loss, but connectionists
<br>
don't expect reliability anyway), or rule sets turned into NNs. More
<br>
sophisticated reccurent, spiking, dynamic-toplogy or otherwise
<br>
unconventional connectionist systems pose more of a challenge, but in
<br>
general connectionist networks are far less opaque to appropriate
<br>
data-mining algorithms than they appear to unaided human perception.
<br>
While still not useful for (well-designed) AGI, this field does at least
<br>
offer tools that may one day be useful for understanding human wetware,
<br>
as well as puncturing some of the connectionist mystique.
