Hi Eli,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The problem is that what is logically correct is that an observation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a non-black non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that all ravens are black.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E.T. Jaynes would have exploded on that one.  Jaynes is dead, so I guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll have to handle this one myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your statement is certainly not logically correct.  I can easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate situations in which observing a non-black non-raven can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate evidence favoring the hypothesis &quot;All ravens are black&quot; over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its alternatives.  For example, the set of objects includes 7 ravens and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 non-raven.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, an observation of a non-black raven TOGETHER WITH SPECIAL ASSUMPTIONS
<br>
ABOUT THE SITUATION can yield evidence toward the hypothesis that all
<br>
ravens are black.
<br>
<p>But in the absence of explicitly stated special assumptions, an observation
<br>
of a non-black non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis
<br>
that all ravens are black.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More importantly, your statement is mathematical nonsense.
</em><br>
<p>My statement was not mathematics, but conceptually, I believe it was
<br>
correct -- except for the omitted emendation
<br>
&quot;in the absence of explicitly stated special assumptions.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   There is simply no such thing as evidence which favors a hypothesis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is only evidence which favors a hypothesis over other hypotheses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   This follows directly from the definition of &quot;evidence&quot; as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likelihood ratio.  A ratio needs a numerator and a denominator.
</em><br>
<p>I am not defining &quot;evidence&quot; in the same way that you are.  According to
<br>
my semantics of evidence, it IS possible to have evidence which simply
<br>
favors an hypothesis.
<br>
<p>&quot;Evidence&quot; is a philosophical term which can be formally grounded in many
<br>
different ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Considering how many different ways standard probability theory has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven to be the unique method of reasoning that obeys consistency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms XYZ, it is a simpler hypothesis that you are wrong about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation providing ZERO evidence.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think probability theory is incorrect, and I think Cox's proof
<br>
and its successsors are quite impressive demonstrations of the general
<br>
utility of probability theory.
<br>
<p>However, Cox's axioms are about single-number measures of uncertainty,
<br>
and don't say anything about the possible need for two or more numbers
<br>
to quantify uncertainty (e.g. the utility of using a second number
<br>
besides probability to quantify the amount of evidence).
<br>
<p>They also don't tell you anything about how to integrate probability
<br>
theory with the logic of variables, how to deal with intension vs.
<br>
extension, etc. etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However, what frustrates me about the quote you cite, and your attitude,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is that you seem to be denying that probability theory as standardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deployed is conceptually and logically erroneous in this case -- albeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the magnitude of its error is generally small.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, Ben, I do deny that standard probability theory is &quot;conceptually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and logically erroneous&quot; in this quite straightforward case.  At this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point you really should read Jaynes, who uses (correctly formulated and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied) probability theory to knock down one alleged &quot;paradox&quot; after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another.
</em><br>
<p>Heyyy -- I read Jaynes when you were in diapers, sonny boy ;_) ...
<br>
<p>and then I reread him (and read his more recent stuff) about 5 years back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is your own theory which is the approximation that makes small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; errors.  You omit from consideration the small amounts of evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided by sampling a random object or a random non-black object and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding that it is not a nonblack raven.
</em><br>
<p>Sampling a random object and finding it is not a nonblack raven provides
<br>
NO evidence that all ravens are black -- not unless one is operating in
<br>
a situation where special assumptions and conditions apply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uh... didn't someone, I think Frank Ramsey but possibly Stalnaker, prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it was *impossible* to transform P(B|A) into P(A -&gt; B), using any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connective -&gt; that was true or false in any given possible world?  Or am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I misunderstanding what you're trying to do here?
</em><br>
<p>It is impossible to make that transformation in a *certain and infallible*
<br>
way, but it can be done in an approximative way using second-order
<br>
probabilities.
<br>
<p>This leads into some math that is discussed in our in-process book on
<br>
PTL (the Novamente-design book has now been sent to a publisher for
<br>
consideration; the PTL book will follow in 6 months or so....)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, you don't make it clear how Novamente decides p(
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is_black(x) | is_raven(x) ), which is the whole problem at hand.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the simplest way is to count the percentage of the ravens that you
<br>
see that are black.
<br>
<p>Of course, there are subtleties if ravens can be part black, but those
<br>
are simple to handle.
<br>
<p>Then there is the role of inference in dealing with indirect evidence,
<br>
of course... which is too long a story for this email.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; randomly sample a small group and find a couple of black ravens, then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after this, when I repeatedly sample non-black objects from the small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group and none of them are ravens, or even if I randomly sample objects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they are not nonblack ravens, then even without observing more black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravens, my p(black|raven) should go on increasing.
</em><br>
<p>If you randomly sample a bunch of objects and they are purple microphones,
<br>
this
<br>
should NOT increase your estimate of P(black|raven) -- not unless you have
<br>
some special assumptions about the group from which all these objects
<br>
are drawn.  [Or unless you're willing to do some speculative
<br>
intensional-to-extensional
<br>
inference and assume that because ravens and microphones are both Earthly
<br>
objects that share some properties, there is a nonzero chance they share
<br>
coloration as well....  In this vein, if you sample a bunch of objects and
<br>
they're purple geese, then this
<br>
could sensibly decrease your estimate of P(black|raven) by a significant
<br>
amount, since geese
<br>
are similar to ravens and so there is some justification to think that
<br>
they might have some similarity in coloration pattern.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The definition of evidence in PTL makes clear that the only evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that counts for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; P( is_black(x) | is_raven(x) )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the set of x for which is_raven(x) has a nonzero truth value,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and therefore Hempel's paradox does not exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that PTL ignores relevant evidence, then.
</em><br>
<p>No, it ignores IRRELEVANT evidence in &quot;direct evaluation&quot; of truth values.
<br>
<p>In inference (e.g. guessing that because some geese are purple, and both
<br>
geese
<br>
and ravens are birds, then some ravens may be purple too) PTL can use
<br>
evidence besides x for which is_raven(x) has a nonzero truth value.  But
<br>
this
<br>
is explicitly recognized as speculative inference that may be erroneous....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for Hempel's paradox not existing, as far as I can tell, you haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressed it at all.  Exactly the same definition would show that P(
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is_not_raven(x) | is_not_black(x) ) only uses as evidence the set of x
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for which is_not_black(x) has nonzero truth value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PTL's estimate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    ForAll x { is_raven(x) ==&gt; is_black(x) }
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to be identical to its estimate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    ForAll x { is_not_black(x) ==&gt; is_not_raven(x) }
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and if it's not, that's Hempel's Paradox square in the face.
</em><br>
<p>Well, clearly
<br>
<p>P(black|raven)
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>P(~raven|~black)
<br>
<p>have different truth values, in general.  So, based on a given finite body
<br>
of
<br>
evidence, the truth value estimate for
<br>
<p>ForAll x, raven(x) ==&gt; black(x)
<br>
<p>will NOT be the same as the truth value estimate for
<br>
<p>ForAll x, ~black(x) ==&gt; ~raven(x)
<br>
<p>But this doesn't mean that PTL succumbs to Hempel's Paradox, quite the
<br>
contrary.
<br>
<p>It means that in PTL, just because two predicates A and B are equivalent
<br>
according to crisp logic, this doesn't necessarily  mean that evidence for A
<br>
counts as evidence for B and vice versa.
<br>
<p>(Raven ==&gt; black) is equivalent to (~black ==&gt; ~raven) in crisp logic, but
<br>
in
<br>
PTL's probabilistic logic, these two need not have identical truth values,
<br>
because they are associated with different bodies of &quot;direct evidence.&quot;
<br>
<p>In philosophical terms, PTL rejects the &quot;principle of equivalence&quot; in its
<br>
full generality.  To get Hempel's paradox via the principle of equivalence
<br>
we
<br>
need to infer
<br>
<p>raven ==&gt; black
<br>
thus
<br>
black OR ~raven
<br>
thus
<br>
~~black OR ~raven
<br>
thus
<br>
~black ==&gt; ~raven
<br>
<p>The equivalence works in the case of crisp truth values, but it doesn't
<br>
work in the case of uncertain truth values, because
<br>
<p>* for raven ==&gt; black, only ravens count as part of the total evidence,
<br>
whereas
<br>
<p>* for ~black ==&gt; ~raven, only nonblack things count as part of the total
<br>
evidence
<br>
<p>* for (black OR ~raven), the total evidence is the whole relevant universe
<br>
(or specifically, all entities whose blackness or ravenness is evaluable)
<br>
<p>This has to do with the difference between term logic and predicate logic
<br>
... in term logic, uncertain truth values need not be preserved via
<br>
crisp-logical equivalence transformations.  Rather, each logical equivalence
<br>
transformation has a specific uncertain-truth-value &quot;inference rule&quot;
<br>
associated with it.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this dialogue is fun, but it's going to get way too long and
<br>
intractable because to substantiate everything I'm talking about here in
<br>
detail would require me to give a lot of PTL math, which is basically the
<br>
point of the in-process PTL book...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;I shall now demonstrate the folly of adulterating Bayes with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lesser wares.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Suppose that I know that, in a certain sample, there is at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;black raven, and at least one blue teapot, and some number of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;ravens of unknown color.  I now observe an item from the group that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;produced by the following sampling method:  Someone looks over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;group, and if there are no non-black ravens, he tosses out a blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;teapot.  If there are non-black ravens, he tosses out a black raven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Now observing a black raven definitely shows that not all ravens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;are black.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;How would Novamente's &quot;augmented&quot; probability theory handle that case, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;wonder?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given the constraints you've introduced, the only way Novamente has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; handle this problem is to use &quot;higher-order inference&quot;, which means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to explicitly represent the definition of the problem in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; variables and quantifiers, in a manner similar to predicate logic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Standard Bayes doesn't need to resort to higher-order logic to solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this problem.  It just says what our expectations are, given various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypotheses, same as in any other case.
</em><br>
<p>True, this case may be dealt with more simply in the standard probabilistic
<br>
framework than in PTL.  But it's still quite fast and easy for PTL, no
<br>
problem at all....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The difference is that, unlike standard predicate logic, Novamente has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; formulas for managing uncertain truth values attached to quantified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; logical formulae.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I could write out the details of this example in Novamente formalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and may do so later as it's a moderately amusing exercise, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have time at the moment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds overcomplicated... not good for efficiency.
</em><br>
<p>Well, all the PTL truth value formulas are quite simple.  Dealing with
<br>
quantified
<br>
logical formulae can be complicated or simple depending on what you're
<br>
doing.
<br>
<p>The only inefficient part of PTL is inference control -- adaptively pruning
<br>
the &quot;search tree&quot; of possible inferences.  This is supposed to be solved via
<br>
applying PTL to attention allocation and assignment of credit, in the
<br>
Novamente
<br>
design, but we haven't tested this aspect yet.
<br>
<p>We have tuned PTL and Novamente's knowledge representation to give compact
<br>
representations for human commonsense knowledge, and short inference trails
<br>
for human commonsense inferences.  The idea is that problems that are easy
<br>
for ordinary humans should be easy for it....  How well we've succeeded
<br>
at this, time will tell ;-)
