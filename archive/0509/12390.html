<p>
Richard,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answers that others offer to your questions are, pretty much:  no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you cannot really avoid complex systems, and mathematical verification 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their friendliness is the very last thing you would be able to do. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The main defining characteristic of complex systems is that such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical verification is out of reach.
</em><br>
<p>There is no question that human mind/brain is a complex system which 
<br>
achieves its intelligence via emergence, self-organization, strange
<br>
attractors, terminal attractors, and all that great stuff....
<br>
<p>And there is little question that emergence-based intelligence is
<br>
intrinsically very difficult to predict and control with a high
<br>
degree of reliability, thus rendering verified Friendliness an
<br>
unlikely outcome.
<br>
<p>However, these observations don't tell you much about whether it's
<br>
possible to use digital computers to create an intelligence that
<br>
DOESN'T rely critically on the emergent phenomena typically 
<br>
associated with biological complex dynamical systems.
<br>
<p>Semi-similarly, the human mind/brain probably uses complex emergent
<br>
phenomena to add 2+2 and get 4, but, a calculator doesn't, and a
<br>
calculator does a better job of arithmetic anyway.
<br>
<p>One may argue that flexible, creative intelligence is fundamentally 
<br>
different than arithmetic, and is not achievable within limited
<br>
computational resources except via complex, unpredictable emergent
<br>
dynamics.  In fact I strongly SUSPECT this is true, but I haven't SHOWN
<br>
that it's true in a convincing way, and I'm not 100% convinced
<br>
it's true.
<br>
<p>If you have a strong argument why this contention is true, I'd be
<br>
very eager to hear it.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, some others seems pretty sure that the opposite is true,
<br>
and that it IS possible to achieve powerful intelligence under
<br>
limited resources without requiring unpredictable emergent phenomena.
<br>
<p>However, I haven't seen any strong arguments in this direction either.
<br>
<p>-- Ben Goertzel
