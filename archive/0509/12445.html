<p>
Here in LA, CA; My boss, Peter Voss has a discussion group, named
<br>
after the restaurant it meets in, a nice Japanese place called Kifune.
<br>
<p>Kifune has run, off and on for quite a few years. It's been
<br>
languishing lately because things are so busy at a2i2. The schedule
<br>
has been a little inconsistent, and so attendance has suffered as
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>So I am taking over the scheduling and arranging of things, although
<br>
Peter will still be attending and presiding.
<br>
<p>Kifune has several nice aspects. First, it's a close, personal
<br>
environment, where things can be discussed in a casual manner with
<br>
people who are interested in the topic of conversation(the food isn't
<br>
bad either). Second, even in reduced attendance, it attracts people
<br>
from varied fields and professions, like chemical and rocket
<br>
engineers, neurobiologists, and professional nurses, this can lead to
<br>
very interesting discussions, where wildly 'out of context' experience
<br>
can lead to new ideas.
<br>
<p>We have a topic for each meeting, as well as a list of news items and
<br>
interesting tidbits for people to bring context and commentary on if
<br>
they wish. See the announcement for this Sunday here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kifune/message/116">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/kifune/message/116</a>
<br>
<p>I'm going to try to move to a format where each topic has an assigned
<br>
primary speaker, who will present material, and bring people up to a
<br>
level of understanding where they can discuss the issue intelligently.
<br>
<p>I'll be the first speaker, and we'll be discussing chaos and
<br>
complexity as it relates to prediction.
<br>
<p>So, three things. If you live in LA or will be in the area on Sunday,
<br>
October 2nd, Consider dropping by. Even if chaos and prediction aren't
<br>
your favorite topics, we discuss many things and we'd like to hear
<br>
from you. You can email me for directions and introductions, or just
<br>
ask for Peter's party at the door.
<br>
<p>If you would like to present a topic for discussion in a casual
<br>
environment, whether it be current events in science and futurism,
<br>
your pet ideas for transhumanist endeavors, or a bold new way to
<br>
singularity, send me an email, and we can discuss you presenting at a
<br>
future Kifune. Depending on attendance and interest, I'll be setting a
<br>
future schedule. I'm expecting to have one once a month, preference
<br>
for sunday.
<br>
<p>And last, the Salmon is really magic at Kifune. Peter's been going for
<br>
more than ten years and ordering the same thing.
