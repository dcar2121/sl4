Eliezer has said he thinks that his approach can capture the
<br>
subtleties of human intelligence. I'm inclined to believe that his
<br>
approach can capture the subtleties of human deduction, and some
<br>
amount of inference, but I have a question :
<br>
<p>How about the conceptual framework? aka Cognitive schema, noema. How
<br>
is it that human breaks the world into logical objects? Sometimes it's
<br>
done in an aristotelian way -- necessary and sufficient conditions,
<br>
the principle of conflict. By understanding phenomena as made up of
<br>
inter-relating objects, and then working out those objects are on the
<br>
basis of whether a candidate object has internal conflict, you can
<br>
break the world up into objects.
<br>
<p>For example, the coke can and my desk, considered as a single
<br>
candidate object, exhibits conflict in that I can move the coke can
<br>
away from the desk. Thus it is better to think of them as two objects.
<br>
<p>It seems like the human mind performs some kind of ad hoc reduction of
<br>
phenomena into objects. These objects, plus our set of beliefs about
<br>
relationships (such as beliefs about the relatedness of two particular
<br>
objects, or kinds of relation like above, below, or relatedness per
<br>
se) make up our tools for reasoning.
<br>
<p>How is it that an Eliezer approach (Bayes plus whatever else he cares
<br>
to include) can do this phenomenological reduction?
<br>
<p>How do our ideas about the phenomena we observe carry into logic
<br>
itself? It seems like logical structure is a priori true, but it seems
<br>
at least possible that some things like this are just the result of
<br>
observation. Anyway, I don't know exactly where all of this is headed,
<br>
but I think there's something interesting in there.
<br>
<p>If you start with a bad noema, then no matter how good your abilities
<br>
to refine rules of relationship are, then you cannot succeed. If you
<br>
have a bad information representation, then you may fail to capture
<br>
truth. How would you go about performing generalisation under a
<br>
Bayesian system?
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
