</em><br>
<p>In the CIA Factbook, you'll find many countries whose
<br>
populations are over 99% Catholic, and many countries
<br>
whose populations are over 99% Muslim.  Take as given
<br>
that both Catholics and Muslims would assert that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1) choosing the correct religion is the most
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important thing you can do in life, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) the other religion is wrong.
<br>
<p>Suppose that
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) (actually a clearly false supposition, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps an acceptable approximation) People in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both countries are able to get enough information on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both religions to make equally good decisions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2) These populations are representative of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human reasoning abilities in general.
<br>
<p>Since we don't know the correct decision, one can
<br>
show through tedious reasoning that the largest
<br>
number of rational reasoners is possible if we suppose
<br>
that the evidence for Catholicism and Islam is
<br>
equally good, and that no other choices exist,
<br>
so that half of all rational reasoners make the
<br>
mistaken choice that is the majority choice in
<br>
their culture.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
This shows that a maximum of 2% of humans are,
<br>
to a bare minimum extent, rational.
<br>
<p>One could object that, if the evidence for Catholicism and
<br>
Islam really is equally good, a rational person would
<br>
choose whichever of them is dominant in their culture and
<br>
hence most convenient for them.  This is actually a pretty
<br>
good argument against what I just said.  Rats.
<br>
<p>People have done studies showing that the height of
<br>
Presidential candidates accounts for X% of the variance
<br>
across elections, their region of origin accounts for Y%,
<br>
their attractiveness accounts for W%,
<br>
their religion accounts for Z%, and so on.  I'd be very
<br>
curious to see someone sum these up, and see what
<br>
percentage of the variance remains to be accounted for
<br>
by, among other things, the issues.
