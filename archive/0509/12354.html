<p>Yeah, that is basically correct, via the mapping between PTL's
<br>
truth values and Walley's interval probabilities (which are derived
<br>
based on reasoning about betting, as it happens...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, I can still arrange
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing power, even if your approximation doesn't give absurd answers.
</em><br>
<p>That is also correct, and is quite unproblematic from an AGI perspective,
<br>
since given finite resources we are not trying to make an all-knowing
<br>
AGI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what you *needed* to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do was sit bolt upright and say &quot;Wait, something's wrong with my math!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as soon as you thought PTL gave an answer substantially different from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Bayesian one.  This would have saved some time, even if you didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know whether you'd messed up the Bayesian math, the PTL math, or both.
</em><br>
<p>Well, actually, it wasn't my MATH that was wrong per se, it was the way I
<br>
was feeding the information about the conceptual problem into the math
<br>
formalism...
<br>
<p>What I was thinking was that the mapping of the conceptual
<br>
Hempel paradox into PTL math somehow led to a different formalization than
<br>
the
<br>
mapping of the Hempel paradox into conventional probabilistic math.  In
<br>
that case, the answers could have been different because the formalizations
<br>
of the question were somehow different.
<br>
<p>But anyway, this turned out not to be the case...
<br>
<p>The discussion improved my understanding of PTL a little ... and
<br>
gave me another nice, simple example for the PTL book...
<br>
<p>Basically, the &quot;different formalization of the Hempel paradox&quot; I was
<br>
using turned out to be a formalization that assumed the knowledge of the
<br>
reasoner was restricted to a &quot;local context&quot; consisting only of his own
<br>
recent observations.  But this local context didn't take into account
<br>
extra assumptions like &quot;there is at least one raven&quot; and therefore
<br>
wasn't really the right one to assume the reasoner was using.  PTL can
<br>
do reasoning using various different contexts; restricting the context
<br>
can improve efficiency at cost of decreasing accuracy.  In this
<br>
particular case restricting the context as I was doing wouldn't
<br>
decrease accuracy much but it would make it miss the small effect
<br>
noted in the Bayesian analysis of Hempel's paradox.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find a case where you think PTL gives a different result from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability theory, and you see nothing alarming about this, but instead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude offhandedly that probability theory must be wrong, you will end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up not noticing when you divide by zero.
</em><br>
<p>Well, truth be told, I end up not noticing when I divide by zero all
<br>
the time ;)
<br>
<p>Generally speaking, I tend to have a pretty high error rate but also a
<br>
pretty high rate of generation of interesting and high-quality ideas ...
<br>
and I'm ultimately careful enough to check my ideas and remove errors ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem is that you're regarding Bayesian probability theory as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational library, a tool for solving problems.  It's not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probability theory is the underlying mathematics of the thing you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to do.
</em><br>
<p>Probability theory is PART OF the underlying mathematics of intelligence,
<br>
it's not a complete mathematics of intelligence...
<br>
<p>And, it does of course provide a set of tools for solving problems.
<br>
<p>It also provides a &quot;way of thinking&quot; which is valuable in solving many
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>My statement about the limitations of probabilistic thinking as regards
<br>
AGI was not intended to mean that there are aspects of AGI to which
<br>
probability theory is inapplicable.  Rather, it was intended to mean
<br>
that there are crucial aspects of AGI for which the probabilistic way
<br>
of thinking is not all that overwhelmingly useful, and for which other
<br>
quite different ways of thinking are much more useful (even though
<br>
these other ways of thinking are ultimately *consistent* with probability
<br>
theory).
