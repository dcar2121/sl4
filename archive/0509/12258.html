<em>&gt; Well, my issue with a purely probabilistic approach is that it doesn't

</em><br>
<p>This is certainly a valid concern, but I wouldn't consider it a
<br>
criticism of probability theory as such. Probability theory operates
<br>
on atomic statements, and trying to use raw probability theory for
<br>
high level cognition would be as silly as GOFAI symbolic reasoning
<br>
on detail-free tokens. 'Concepts' are elements or regularities at a
<br>
considerably higher level of organisational, and much more
<br>
constructive detail would be required to discuss them.
<br>
<p>I certainly wouldn't claim that that probability theory is sufficient
<br>
for intelligence. It's true that I haven't specified what additional
<br>
complexity should be layered on top to get up to the level where one
<br>
can reasonably talk about 'concepts', nor have I addressed many
<br>
questions of tractability. But I think progress can be made on the
<br>
questions of whether probability theory is a valid place to start,
<br>
and whether behaviour /above/ the concept level can also be Bayesian,
<br>
without such detail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what about hypothesis formation? The space of possible hypotheses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very large.  Most of AI is devoted to search techniques for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; searching hypothesis space, and these techniques suck in an AGI context.
</em><br>
<p>Again, very important question, wish I could discuss it more. But for
<br>
the purposes of this argument the question is whether any useful
<br>
mechanism of hypothesis search would inevitably introduce 'Complexity'
<br>
that would render the system thoroughly impossible to predict. I am
<br>
not aware of any such mechanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have never seen an adequate concept/hypothesis formation method
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's based solely on probabilistic concepts. Do you have one that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd care to discuss?
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately I'm going to have to ask for a rain check on that. I'd
<br>
enjoy discussing this area with you, but this isn't the time or the
<br>
place. That said these are definitely the questions that people
<br>
/should/ be asking, and I would've been considerably more impressed
<br>
with the original poster if he'd actually managed to identify them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Distributed systems, as commonly used in large-scale infrastructure
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the Connection Machine, in terms of algorithm design and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis....
</em><br>
<p>Agree, but similar MIMD techniques are common in high-performance
<br>
scientific computing. The connection machine was a fascinating,
<br>
pioneering project which went to completely new places (I for one
<br>
would love to to have worked at Thinking Machines), but twenty years
<br>
later those areas are starting to get quite familiar.
