<em>&gt; At the risk of being whipped by the list-sniper again...   In 1984 the TTAPS

</em><br>
<p><p>You are less likely to be whipped for posting somewhat off-topic than you
<br>
are for posting something arguably off-topic that is also nonsense to any
<br>
person with a modicum of Google skills.  You just provided an example:
<br>
<p><p>- The &quot;nuclear winter&quot; study you cite has been discredited for a number of
<br>
reasons, but the important part is that it greatly over-stated the cooling
<br>
effect and very badly modeled atmosphere physics to the point of being
<br>
useless.
<br>
<p>- The US has ~1500 MT of nuclear weapons.  The Russians have a fair bit
<br>
more.  Most of these are airburst weapons, with the greatly reduced
<br>
environmental impact implied.  This is a relatively small aggregate yield in
<br>
comparison to many things.
<br>
<p>- There are a few volcanic explosions every century with yields that exceed
<br>
the combined nuclear capability of the US and Russia, putting fantastic
<br>
quantities of junk in the atmosphere.  Novarupta in 1912 (what, you've never
<br>
heard of it?) exceeded the combined yield of all nuclear arsenals, and
<br>
launched vast quantities of aerosols and particulates into the stratosphere,
<br>
yet a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; scenario never materialized.
<br>
<p>- In studies of the climate effects of massive volcanic explosions that
<br>
launch cubic miles of aerosols and particulates into the stratosphere, the
<br>
only ones on record that had a significant short-term cooling effect had
<br>
yields that exceed nuclear arsenals by an order of magnitude, and in those
<br>
cases the significant effects were not global.
<br>
<p><p><p>In other words, your position is pretty damn shaky.  I don't see how a
<br>
reasonable person could look at the relevant facts in aggregate and assert
<br>
that a catastrophic nuclear winter would occur simply by using the nuclear
<br>
capability of the world.  Nature has far more destructive potential than we
<br>
do, and uses it regularly.
<br>
<p>Get off the nuclear weapons fixation already.  It is a relatively minor
<br>
threat to your survival -- you are far more likely to be killed by a nasty
<br>
virus than a nuke.
<br>
