</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMO this is *not* a fine answer, it's a dodge of the issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that what is logically correct is that an observation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a non-black non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all ravens are black.
</em><br>
<p>E.T. Jaynes would have exploded on that one.  Jaynes is dead, so I guess 
<br>
I'll have to handle this one myself.
<br>
<p>Your statement is certainly not logically correct.  I can easily 
<br>
generate situations in which observing a non-black non-raven can 
<br>
generate evidence favoring the hypothesis &quot;All ravens are black&quot; over 
<br>
its alternatives.  For example, the set of objects includes 7 ravens and 
<br>
1 non-raven.  We randomly sample a non-black object and find that it is 
<br>
not a raven.  If we carry out this operation a sufficient number of 
<br>
times, each time finding a red lampshade, it becomes asymptotically 
<br>
certain that all ravens are black, as compared to the hypothesis that 1 
<br>
raven is nonblack, 2 ravens are nonblack, etc.  This is a standard 
<br>
Bayesian analysis for finite sets and I do not think you would care to 
<br>
dispute it.  Taking the limit as the ratio of non-black non-ravens to 
<br>
ravens goes to infinity, the evidence provided by sampling a nonblack 
<br>
object and finding that it is not a raven approaches zero.
<br>
<p>If we randomly sample a non-raven (note that this is different from 
<br>
randomly sampling an object, or randomly sampling a non-black object) 
<br>
then this evidence should have equal likelihood ratios for most 
<br>
hypotheses about ravens, providing our hypotheses about ravens are 
<br>
independent of our hypotheses about other objects.  Perhaps these two 
<br>
background assumptions (ravens independent of other objects, random 
<br>
sampling of a non-raven) are what you had in mind when you stated that 
<br>
seeing a non-black non-raven should provide NO evidence in favor of the 
<br>
assertion that all ravens are black.  (Note that as the ratio of 
<br>
nonravens to ravens goes to infinity, sampling a random object 
<br>
asymptotically approaches sampling a non-raven.)
<br>
<p>More importantly, your statement is mathematical nonsense.  Whether 
<br>
observing a non-black non-raven increases the collective probability 
<br>
mass assigned to hypotheses which include the statement &quot;All ravens are 
<br>
black&quot;, will in general depend on which other hypotheses are competing. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is simply no such thing as evidence which favors a hypothesis. 
<br>
There is only evidence which favors a hypothesis over other hypotheses. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This follows directly from the definition of &quot;evidence&quot; as a 
<br>
likelihood ratio.  A ratio needs a numerator and a denominator.
<br>
<p>Another way of looking at it:  Probability mass can neither be created 
<br>
nor destroyed, it always has to sum to 1.  If the probability mass of 
<br>
one hypothesis increases, it has to come from other hypotheses.  This 
<br>
redistribution, however you carry it out, makes an implicit statement 
<br>
about likelihood ratios.  Denying this just ensures that your apparent 
<br>
likelihood ratios make no sense.  It is like people who try to deny that 
<br>
they assign prior probabilities, and hence end up assigning absurd prior 
<br>
probabilities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If probability theory as standardly deployed states that an observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a non-black non-raven provides a NON-ZERO amount of evidence toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hypothesis that all ravens are black, then this shows there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something wrong with probability theory as standardly deployed.
</em><br>
<p>Considering how many different ways standard probability theory has been 
<br>
proven to be the unique method of reasoning that obeys consistency 
<br>
axioms XYZ, it is a simpler hypothesis that you are wrong about the 
<br>
observation providing ZERO evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, what frustrates me about the quote you cite, and your attitude,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that you seem to be denying that probability theory as standardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deployed is conceptually and logically erroneous in this case -- albeit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the magnitude of its error is generally small.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Ben, I do deny that standard probability theory is &quot;conceptually 
<br>
and logically erroneous&quot; in this quite straightforward case.  At this 
<br>
point you really should read Jaynes, who uses (correctly formulated and 
<br>
applied) probability theory to knock down one alleged &quot;paradox&quot; after 
<br>
another.  (Quite often, the paradox has to do with assuming infinities 
<br>
directly in the math, rather than passing to the limit of finite cases.)
<br>
<p>It is your own theory which is the approximation that makes small 
<br>
errors.  You omit from consideration the small amounts of evidence 
<br>
provided by sampling a random object or a random non-black object and 
<br>
finding that it is not a nonblack raven.
<br>
<p>I, too, expect that an efficient AI will omit these small amounts of 
<br>
evidence, because the evidence is too small to be worth the time cost of 
<br>
updating, or the memory cost of representing probabilities to that 
<br>
precision.  But the evidence is still there in theory, and becomes 
<br>
highly relevant in practice for small sets of objects.  That's why I use 
<br>
the illustration of small sets to overcome the instinctive human 
<br>
tendency to *approximate* the evidence as zero.
<br>
<p>You have started thinking that planets really do move in epicycles 
<br>
instead of ellipses.  &quot;NO evidence&quot; is the tractable approximation.  &quot;A 
<br>
very small amount of evidence&quot; is the mathematically correct answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your followup comments are intelligent and well-thought-out, but, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't really solve the problems with the attempted solution given in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the paragraph you cite above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the Hempel problem is handled more artfully in Novamente.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In PTL, we can estimate the truth value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ForAll x { is_raven(x) ==&gt; is_black(x) }
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a transform of the truth value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P( is_black(x) | is_raven(x) )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [the simplest rule for this is, e.g. s^N estimates the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the former statement where s is an estimate of the probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the latter statement and N defines the amount of (explicit or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implicit) evidence used  to arrive at s].
</em><br>
<p>Uh... didn't someone, I think Frank Ramsey but possibly Stalnaker, prove 
<br>
that it was *impossible* to transform P(B|A) into P(A -&gt; B), using any 
<br>
connective -&gt; that was true or false in any given possible world?  Or am 
<br>
I misunderstanding what you're trying to do here?
<br>
<p>Furthermore, you don't make it clear how Novamente decides p( 
<br>
is_black(x) | is_raven(x) ), which is the whole problem at hand.  If I 
<br>
randomly sample a small group and find a couple of black ravens, then, 
<br>
after this, when I repeatedly sample non-black objects from the small 
<br>
group and none of them are ravens, or even if I randomly sample objects 
<br>
and they are not nonblack ravens, then even without observing more black 
<br>
ravens, my p(black|raven) should go on increasing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The definition of evidence in PTL makes clear that the only evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that counts for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P( is_black(x) | is_raven(x) )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the set of x for which is_raven(x) has a nonzero truth value,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and therefore Hempel's paradox does not exist.
</em><br>
<p>It seems that PTL ignores relevant evidence, then.
<br>
<p>As for Hempel's paradox not existing, as far as I can tell, you haven't 
<br>
addressed it at all.  Exactly the same definition would show that P( 
<br>
is_not_raven(x) | is_not_black(x) ) only uses as evidence the set of x 
<br>
for which is_not_black(x) has nonzero truth value.
<br>
<p>PTL's estimate for
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ForAll x { is_raven(x) ==&gt; is_black(x) }
<br>
<p>ought to be identical to its estimate for
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ForAll x { is_not_black(x) ==&gt; is_not_raven(x) }
<br>
<p>and if it's not, that's Hempel's Paradox square in the face.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I shall now demonstrate the folly of adulterating Bayes with lesser wares.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Suppose that I know that, in a certain sample, there is at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;black raven, and at least one blue teapot, and some number of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ravens of unknown color.  I now observe an item from the group that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;produced by the following sampling method:  Someone looks over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;group, and if there are no non-black ravens, he tosses out a blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;teapot.  If there are non-black ravens, he tosses out a black raven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Now observing a black raven definitely shows that not all ravens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are black.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;How would Novamente's &quot;augmented&quot; probability theory handle that case, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;wonder?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the constraints you've introduced, the only way Novamente has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle this problem is to use &quot;higher-order inference&quot;, which means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to explicitly represent the definition of the problem in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variables and quantifiers, in a manner similar to predicate logic.
</em><br>
<p>Standard Bayes doesn't need to resort to higher-order logic to solve 
<br>
this problem.  It just says what our expectations are, given various 
<br>
hypotheses, same as in any other case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The difference is that, unlike standard predicate logic, Novamente has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulas for managing uncertain truth values attached to quantified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical formulae.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could write out the details of this example in Novamente formalism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and may do so later as it's a moderately amusing exercise, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have time at the moment.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds overcomplicated... not good for efficiency.
