<p>You have done exactly what I begged people not to do:  completely failed to
<br>
understand the argument as a whole, and instead misconstrued (and worse,
<br>
misrepresented) individual arguments.   So long as you refer to the CAS
<br>
argument as &quot;proud ignorance,&quot; or keep demanding that I give you &quot;one good,
<br>
solid, predictive equation applying to cognitive systems that stems from
<br>
CAS,&quot; or draw false analogies with Carnot Engines (which describe the
<br>
*non-Complex* aspects of thermodynamics), you only demonstrate that my core
<br>
point has still not been understood.
<br>
<p><p>Here is why I introduced the Ptolemaic Epicycles analogy, spelled out in
<br>
the simplest possible language:  the Ptolemaic crowd could have issued the
<br>
same pointless challenge that you are trying to issue, viz: &quot;Name three
<br>
subtleties, heck, name one subtlety, and see what I make of it.&quot;   You have
<br>
said yourself that you are going to meet the challenge, if need be, by
<br>
calling upon the resources of infinite computing power.  The Ptolemaists
<br>
would have declared, in exactly the same way, that they were going to
<br>
respond to any challenge by using an infinite number of nested epicycles.
<br>
<p>In fact, it is worth noting that the first people to challenge Ptolemy
<br>
actually had a very hard time of it.  Here is a quote from John D. Fix,
<br>
Astronomy (2nd Ed. updated, page 58):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[Copernicus still assumed circular motions, not ellipses, so...]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To account for variations in the speed with which the planets
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Sun moved among the stars, he had to use epicycles.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Copernicus hoped that the advantages of his theory compared 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with that of Ptolemy would be overwhelmingly obvious to other 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;astronomers.  This was not the case, however.  The heliocentric 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theory was not immediately accepted by other astronomers.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of the  heliocentric solar system noted that the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;astronomical evidence was completely neutral.  There were no 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;observations that could be explained by Copernicus but not by 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ptolemy.  Copernicus claimed that his theory was simpler and 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;more elegant than the geocentric one.  Yet after Copernicus had 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;added epicycles that he needed to account precisely for motions 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the planets, his model had as many circles (or more) than 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;geocentric models.&quot;
<br>
<p>Copernicus claimed that his model possessed elegance and simplicity.  I am
<br>
doing something similar, but you have to understand exactly what is the
<br>
nature of my attack, and not think it is something else.
<br>
<p>I do NOT claim that there are some specific situations that the Bayesian
<br>
approach, implemented on an infinitely large computer, cannot handle.  It
<br>
should have been obvious that that was not what I meant by &quot;subtleties&quot;, so
<br>
you completely misrepresent me by demanding that I name one of them. If I
<br>
were to make such a dumb claim, or if I were to respond to your challenge,
<br>
it would be like Copernicus and one of his challengers getting into an
<br>
argument about the exact parameters of the orbit of Mercury.
<br>
<p>No, the attack I am making is that there are an array of subtle faults that
<br>
the Bayesian approach cannot get out of *unless* it makes recourse to e.g.
<br>
infinite computing power, or postulates that a Bayesian AGI would have a
<br>
certain freakish characteristic (outlined below).  This argument is at the
<br>
paradigm level.
<br>
<p>So, one of those subtleties is that the Complex Systems folks are out there
<br>
saying, in effect:
<br>
<p>******* Quote from a hypothetical CAS theorist *******
<br>
<p>&quot;Wait:  have you tried to put together a complete Bayesian system that
<br>
understands and reasons about the world, *and* which can acquire its own
<br>
knowledge, ground its own concepts and interact with the world?  The reason
<br>
we ask is that we have studied vast numbers of systems that are adaptive,
<br>
and we have noticed a trend:  their global behavior tends to be very
<br>
different from their local mechanisms.  (Indeed, the global seems to be
<br>
impossible to derive from the local.)  The way this applies to your
<br>
specific case is that you want your AGI system to have certain global
<br>
features (like the ability to understand the world, learn new knowledge,
<br>
etc.) but you are trying to build it using local mechanisms that look very
<br>
much like something that you are hoping to get at the global level (the
<br>
system as a whole is supposed to have a global reasoning capacity that is
<br>
Bayesian in character).  If you succeed in doing this - having Bayesian
<br>
global behavior *and* Bayesian local mechanisms - then the folks in the CAS
<br>
community will want to know about it, because you will have produced a
<br>
system that is utterly unique:  it will have the same behavior at both
<br>
global and local level.  In all our experience, we have never seen such a
<br>
thing:  complex systems just don't do that!
<br>
<p>&quot;P.S.  Please don't send us any more proofs or demonstrations or arguments
<br>
that your strict Bayesian core ideas have no Complexity in them;  that they
<br>
are just like some conventional, complicated computer program of the sort
<br>
that exist today.  It might well be true that your core Bayesian ideas are
<br>
that predictable, but that means nothing until you say exactly how a real
<br>
computing system (not some fantasy with infinite computing power!) would
<br>
implement a full AGI, one that also includes enough apparatus to establish
<br>
a mapping from internal representation to external referents as a result of
<br>
its learning system and its particular sensorimotor system.  It is
<br>
precisely in this extended system that all the Complexity is likely to be,
<br>
because it is here that the system has its most reflexive, adaptive
<br>
components, and whenever we have watched people insert those kinds of
<br>
adaptive mechanisms in a system, it either becomes (a) chaotic, (b) dead,
<br>
or (c) complex.
<br>
<p>&quot;P.P.S.  If you don't accept that an extended version of your Bayesian AGI,
<br>
in the sense just described, would actually need any Complex Adaptive
<br>
low-level mechanisms in the extended portion, then show us such a system 
<br>
that actually works.  Show us some really juicy, believable creation of
<br>
new, more and more abstract &quot;concepts&quot; by the system, in domains of
<br>
knowledge far removed from its original programming, where those concepts
<br>
arise from interaction with a non-trivial environment ... and do all of
<br>
this without inserting any code that would render it liable to get Complex.
<br>
&nbsp;Don't just claim that it will work, show it actually happening in a real
<br>
system.  Don't just claim that it is obvious that you could do it:  prove it.&quot;
<br>
<p>******* end hypothetical quote *******
<br>
<p>Here, then, is the Complex Systems equivalent of the &quot;simple and elegant&quot;
<br>
appeal that Copernicus made:  Your fully implemented Bayesian AGI, if it
<br>
could be built, would be a Complex System (in the technical sense), but it
<br>
would also have a direct relationship between its global behavior and its
<br>
local mechanisms, and there is a massive body of evidence that such a
<br>
system would be an utter freak of a complex system.  We don't believe in
<br>
freaks: Occam's Razor, plain and simple.  If you believe, today, that you
<br>
can build such a freakish thing, you are going on blind faith.
<br>
<p>This argument is at the paradigm level.  It is not that there is some
<br>
specific system or equation, devised by someone working down at Santa Fe,
<br>
that can beat out your Bayesian formalism, it's that everything going on at
<br>
Santa Fe indicates that the paradigm on which the Bayesian approach rests
<br>
is flawed because of a &quot;religious&quot; belief that a Bayesian AGI would be
<br>
exempt from the observed characteristics of all other compex systems.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>*Afterword*
<br>
<p>Am I trying to say that an AGI cannot be built at all?  NO!  I believe
<br>
there are other approaches that will let us do it, but I refuse to be drawn
<br>
into that discussion until such time as the above argument is actually
<br>
understood.  There are some very interesting and deep discussions that we
<br>
could all be having about what to do next under such circumstances (I want
<br>
to have those discussions!), but I have to communicate the above argument
<br>
fully, and get it out of the way, before there is any hope of going on to
<br>
the next step.
<br>
<p>If anyone does want to take it further, fine, but this is the last time I
<br>
try to explain this basic stuff.  I am going to ignore any posts at that
<br>
level from now on.
