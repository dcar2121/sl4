I'm not going to jump into this exchange, but I had to shoot down
<br>
some obvious silliness;
<br>
<p><a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Relevance%20of%20Complex%20Systems%20[was:%20Re:%20Retrenchment]">rpwl@lightlink.com</a> wrote:

</em><br>
<p>You are confusing computing power and description length. Eliezer is
<br>
talking about a simple theory using unbounded (not infinite) computing
<br>
power. You are talking about a theory with unbounded complexity, which
<br>
would be impossible to /state/ rather than just impossible to evaluate.
<br>
While Eliezer's tendency to ignore tractability can be annoying, he has
<br>
a point; the universe itself (including your prized complex systems)
<br>
seems to favour short descriptions and computationally inefficient 
<br>
implementations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, the attack I am making is that there are an array of subtle faults
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Bayesian approach cannot get out of
</em><br>
<p>Which you have yet to describe, or rather have tried and failed to
<br>
describe one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ******* Quote from a hypothetical CAS theorist *******
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you succeed in doing this - having Bayesian global behavior *and*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian local mechanisms - then the folks in the CAS community will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to know about it, because you will have produced a  system that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is utterly unique:  it will have the same behavior at both global and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local level. In all our experience, we have never seen such a thing:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex systems just don't do that!
</em><br>
<p>So, you've never heard of fractals then? The idea of patterns of
<br>
structure and behaviour repeating again and again at different levels
<br>
of organisation is utterly novel to you? No wait, you admit that there
<br>
are 'recurring general behaviours' in complex systems, and you admitt
<br>
that complex systems can be nested, so you are just being
<br>
self-contradictory. A Bayesian AGI probably won't meet your definition
<br>
of Complexity anyway, being engineered to maintain hard constraints
<br>
and specific behavioural attractors, but that's almost beside the point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might well be true that your core Bayesian ideas are that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictable, but that means nothing until you say exactly how a real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing system (not some fantasy with infinite computing power!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would implement a full AGI,
</em><br>
<p>Here at last I have some sympathy for your position. It's true, neither
<br>
Eliezer nor I have specified how to actually build a tractable Bayesian
<br>
AGI. But then, you haven't specified how to build anything at all,
<br>
tractable or otherwise. As I see it the onus is on you to specify
<br>
something first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you don't accept that an extended version of your Bayesian AGI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the sense just described, would actually need any Complex Adaptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-level mechanisms in the extended portion, then show us such a system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that actually works.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously we're working on that. In the mean time, you can't demonstrate
<br>
a Bayesian system that shows 'Complex adaptive' behaviour. Ignoring the
<br>
possibility that Bayes just doesn't scale at all, how are you managing
<br>
to claim a predictive accuracy better than indiference as to the outcome?
<br>
<p>Indeed I can quite easily state that no causally chaotic system is
<br>
stable under self-modification, and that all such systems will rapidly
<br>
disintigrate or fall into a causally clean attractor on gaining the
<br>
ability to self-modify. If you don't accept that an AGI based on 'Complex 
<br>
Adaptive' low-level mechanisms will inevitably fall into a 'non-Complex'
<br>
attractor, then show us such a system that actually works. In the mean
<br>
time I can declare victory with the same apparent level of success that
<br>
you can.
