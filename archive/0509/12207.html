</em><br>
<em>&gt; with innovative theories, but a complex final design of a nontrivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of our world. Things are much too complicated for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially software design, wherein the interactions (even inside a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely unexpected to the designer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suppose it just seems very unrealistic to imagine that all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant complexity could be solved, designed, communicated to drones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or done personally, all by one person in any kind of reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time-scale, if it were possible at all. AI in particular is not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an architectural and theoretical problem, but many many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation, engineering, and &quot;mere&quot; software design issues.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely.
<br>
<p>Given the current state of hardware/software tech, it is not feasible
<br>
for one person to put together a seed AI.
<br>
<p>And it's not feasible to envision seed AI as cleanly dividing into an
<br>
&quot;AI layer&quot; and an &quot;implementation layer&quot;, with the maverick genius
<br>
doing the former and his drones filling in the latter. 
<br>
<p>At the present time, there needs to be a fair bit of feedback between 
<br>
these two layers of any wannabe-AGI system, even if they are *reasonably*
<br>
well separated.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, this may not be the case in another 15 years, once
<br>
hardware and software have advanced considerably.  
<br>
<p>So what I would say is: If some small team of individuals doesn't create
<br>
AGI in the next 5-20 years, then perhaps some lone maverick will do it
<br>
20-40 years from now, once technology has developed far enough to support
<br>
lone-maverick activities in this area.
<br>
<p>The reason we don't see lone mavericks building significant, large,
<br>
real-world systems is that there are a lot of people in the world, and
<br>
teams generally emerge to do the job before the underlying support tech
<br>
reaches the point to enable individual-maverick activity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To load examples a bit, I could hold up Google, ostensibly a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovative idea by two graduate students. But upon closer inspection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actual reality of google is the interaction of much more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that. Sergey and Larry did not design the cluster architecture it runs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, nor the Google File System which contains their database, nor the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MapReduce implementation that underlies their fast response time.
</em><br>
<p>Correct.
<br>
<p>Now, in 30 years, implementing Google may be a one-man job, because all
<br>
these support technologies will be commoditized.  But there are many
<br>
enterprising humans, so many valuable things get done when they're still
<br>
at the &quot;needs a team to do it&quot; stage, in terms of the availability of
<br>
underlying support technologies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quite aside from the time aspect, a single person is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too prone to conceptual mistakes and self induced theory blocks. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimistic as I am about mental plasticity, I don't' think any one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person can really solve all the problems that are theoretically within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their intelligence and ability. People get stuck, or lack inclination,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or prefer to focus on more interesting problems, or simply run out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovative ideas.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is a far weaker point.
<br>
<p>While what you say is statistically true, there may always be exceptions 
<br>
to this sort of rule....
<br>
<p>I am much more in sympathy with your prior comments about 
<br>
<p>a) the sheer mass 
<br>
of details involved in a large-scale engineering project making use of 
<br>
immature technologies
<br>
<p>b) the difficulty of separating the purely-scientific from engineering-
<br>
oriented aspects of a complex engineering project
