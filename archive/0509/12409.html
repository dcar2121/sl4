<em>&gt; &gt; 12. Finally, my objection to claims about the value of Complexity theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were summed up by one critic's comment that &quot;Wolfram's 'A New Kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Science' would have been fine if it had been called 'Fun With Graph
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Paper'&quot;. The field has produced a vast amount of hype, a small amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of interesting maths and very few useful predictive theories in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; domains. Its proponents are quick to claim that their ideas apply to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; virtually everything, when in practice they seem to have been actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful in rather few cases. This opinion is based on coverage in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; science press and would be easy to change via evidence, but to date
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no-one has responded to Eliezer's challenge with real examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complexity theory doing something useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I asked for Complexity math applicable to *cognition* in humans or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere, which produces specific predictions better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximum-entropy distributions over the same phenomena.
</em><br>
<p>That is a different request from just asking for &quot;examples of complexity
<br>
theory doing something useful&quot;, indeed.
<br>
<p>Complexity theory has done a lot of useful things, but I'm not sure that
<br>
it's done anything useful for the scientific analysis of data regarding
<br>
human cognition.
<br>
<p>There has been interesting work regarding the complex dynamics of human
<br>
*perception*, e.g. Walter Freeman's work on olfaction in rabbits.
<br>
<p>And there is e.g. Paul Rapp's interesting work on the nonlinear dynamics of
<br>
EEG's in humans as correlated with various psychiatric conditions.
<br>
<p>But none of this is about cognition.  The truth is that complex systems
<br>
theory is basically about DYNAMICS, and we lack really rich time series data
<br>
regarding human cognition.  Until we have data of this form, complexity
<br>
theory will not tell us much about human cognition.
<br>
<p>I am quite confident that the brain is a nonlinear dynamical system, and
<br>
that complexity-science concepts will be useful for understanding how this
<br>
nonlinear dynamical system gives rise to human cognition.  However, to
<br>
validate this would require richer neural time series data than we now
<br>
possess.
<br>
<p>Whether one can make AI's that are not well analyzed in terms of complex
<br>
dynamical systems theory is a totally different question.
