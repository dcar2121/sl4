<p>
The Cyc Project is the largest pure-AI effort, and although most of this 
<br>
audience disagrees with our assumptions, approach and accomplishments, I 
<br>
would like to share some of our development model in the hope of informing 
<br>
skeptics.
<br>
<p>Starting as a sponsored research project at MCC, Austin in the mid-1980's, 
<br>
Cycorp has been staffed at approximately 50 persons since I joined the 
<br>
company in 1999.  We migrated early to open source tools with the notable 
<br>
exception of using Allegro Lisp from Franz, which enabled us to move 
<br>
cleanly from Symbolics Lisp machines to whitebox Linux workstations (about 
<br>
80 in house, one per worker and the rest in server pools or 
<br>
administration).  By 1999 the programming team (about one-half of the 
<br>
workers) built our own lisp runtime in portable GNU C.  This investment 
<br>
was substantial but allows us to deploy Cyc without the Allegro runtime.  
<br>
In the last three years, our client applications have migrated from HTML 
<br>
to Java.  We had reached the limits of what Javascript could do for the user 
<br>
interfaces.
<br>
<p>We use Bugzilla to manage our detailed tasks, and use Cyc itself for 
<br>
project management. Our tasks are oriented around the particular needs 
<br>
of our various sponsored research projects, but our management tries hard 
<br>
to align our tasks to enhance our core capability and make progress 
<br>
towards our AI goal.  
<br>
<p>Here are some of the specialties up to this point:
<br>
<p>1. Operating systems level programming expertise to maintain 
<br>
our runtime infrastructure, and translate from lisp into efficient C for 
<br>
deployment.
<br>
<p>2. Lisp programmers for server-side development including object store, 
<br>
inference modules, database integration and natural language parsing.
<br>
<p>3. Java programmers for client-side development including GUI's and 
<br>
enterprise/semantic-web integration.
<br>
<p>4. Inference programmers who know about deductive, inductive and abductive 
<br>
inference and know how to efficiently support inference in the Cyc 
<br>
knowledge base.
<br>
<p>5. Linguists (also programmers) whose specialties include natural language 
<br>
lexicon, parsing and generation.  We also use third party and open source 
<br>
NL tools.
<br>
<p>6. Philosophers who know how to represent commonsense objects and their 
<br>
relationships in Cyc's predicate calculus language CycL.  They know how to 
<br>
formulate facts and rules to get commonsense questions to answer.
<br>
<p>7. Managers who are familiar with artificial intelligence in general, who 
<br>
have detailed knowledge about the needs of our sponsors, and who can herd 
<br>
the rest of us like cats to get projects delivered as contracted.
<br>
<p>8. Proposal writers.  Among our managers we have some skilled at writing 
<br>
winning proposals.  I attribute our success to our sponsors' satisfaction 
<br>
with our performance and deliverables from previous projects.
<br>
<p>9. System administrators who can keep state-of-practice Linux boxes 
<br>
operating smoothly, with a shared filesystem and secure network.
<br>
<p>10. Human resources, finance, general administration and so forth that one 
<br>
would expect from a company our size.  We are quite proud that our 
<br>
overhead rates are very low compared to other government contractors.
<br>
<p>In summary, before 1999 I too had hoped that a single motivated person 
<br>
could combine the best published research of others, together with open 
<br>
source software components to construct an AGI.  Now that I've been at 
<br>
Cycorp for these six years I believe that a large integrated team will be 
<br>
required because specialized knowledge is key.  Any one area of 
<br>
specialization could entrap the sole inventor.  It's for this reason that 
<br>
published AI research is so specialized.
<br>
<p>Hope this is helpful.
<br>
<p>Cheers.
<br>
