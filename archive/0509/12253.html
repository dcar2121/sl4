<p><p>What, specifically, is so difficult about parallel programming that is not
<br>
thoroughly discussed in transaction theory?  Yes, it is more complicated,
<br>
but not prohibitively so.  As I stated in the same email, most of the
<br>
complication is in trying to design languages/compilers that can usefully
<br>
hide it -- a very different issue.  Actually writing massively parallel
<br>
system architectures to some set of constraints is not rocket science if it
<br>
is possible at all (and I have had to explain to suits more than once that
<br>
some things they wanted were not just difficult but theoretically
<br>
impossible).  Maybe my lack of wide-eyed wonder is that while I do not do
<br>
much 'parallel programming' (whatever that means), I've been designing
<br>
massively parallel systems architectures with many different types of
<br>
constraints for years.  There is no magic left in it for me.
<br>
<p>Yes, I am dismissing the assertion that parallel programming is some kind of
<br>
arcane massively complex art because it is not.  The tools may suck and many
<br>
people may not have much experience with it, but that is not the same as
<br>
being massively complex.  The principles are fairly simple and the
<br>
engineering from those principles is straight forward.
<br>
<p>And massive parallelism is rapidly becoming a standard required feature of
<br>
large-scale infrastructure systems.  It would be hard to design these types
<br>
of systems and NOT be intimately familiar with the theoretical details of
<br>
massive parallelism.
