<p>
If you test a hypothesis in a way which *could* falsify it, and *fail* 
<br>
to falsify it, then your confidence in the hypothesis should increase. 
<br>
The amount by which your confidence should increase should depend on 
<br>
how likely it was that you would falsify your hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Suppose we have a bag full of objects, which can be ravens or 
<br>
not-ravens, and black or not-black. We can reach into the bag with 
<br>
manipulators which can select an object based on whether it's a raven 
<br>
or not, or whether it's black or not, but not both.
<br>
<p>We hypothesize that all ravens in the bag are black. We can falsify 
<br>
this hypothesis by finding a not-black raven. There are two possible 
<br>
experiments we can perform: we can pull out a raven and see if it's 
<br>
not-black, or we can pull out a not-black object and see if it's a 
<br>
raven. Without knowing the relative numbers of ravens to not-black 
<br>
objects, these two searches have an equal chance of finding a not-black 
<br>
raven. Every time we fail to falsify our hypothesis, our confidence in 
<br>
the hypothesis increases. If we find a black object when searching 
<br>
through ravens, our confidence increases because we have failed to 
<br>
falsify the hypothesis. If we find a not-raven when searching through 
<br>
not-black objects, our confidence increases because we have failed to 
<br>
falsify the hypothesis.
<br>
<p>How much our confidence increases for either of the two searches 
<br>
depends on how many of the objects we thought were ravens, and how many 
<br>
of the objects we thought were not-black. If we think that there are 
<br>
many fewer objects which are ravens than objects which are not-black, 
<br>
then our confidence will increase faster by searching through the 
<br>
ravens (alternate pov: the same number of searches gets us closer to an 
<br>
exhaustive search faster checking the few ravens than checking the many 
<br>
not-black objects), but our confidence will still increase a smaller 
<br>
amount searching through the not-black objects. Even a single result of 
<br>
a not-raven found when searching the not-black objects (even a purple 
<br>
goose) increases our confidence, because we tested the hypothesis in a 
<br>
way which could have falsified it, but got a result which didn't.
<br>
<p>If the number of not-black objects in the bag goes to infinity while 
<br>
the number of ravens in the bag stays finite, then the amount our 
<br>
confidence in our hypothesis should increase goes to zero when 
<br>
searching not-black objects for a raven, because it becomes 
<br>
increasingly unlikely that we'll be able to falsify our hypothesis by 
<br>
finding one of the finite number of ravens among the infinite number of 
<br>
not-black objects.
