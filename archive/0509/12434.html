<em>&gt; Any virus bad enough that physical human-to-human interaction and travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dwindles will put a significant damper on the economy.  One of the nice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things about nuclear weapons is that the real damage is pretty localized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Look at what SARS did to the Asian economies in a matter of weeks, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was an insignificant virus in the big scheme of things.  Something nasty and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global, like a particularly bad influenza variant, could hinder the free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flow of goods and services on a spectacular scale.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>All of this discussion seems to be missing the most important point 
<br>
about a viral pandemic:  it won't just &quot;hinder the free flow of goods 
<br>
and services on a spectacular scale&quot; it would cause so much disruption 
<br>
that rampant, uncontrollable civil strife would break out ... and that 
<br>
factor, by itself, could easily send us back to the Dark Ages.
<br>
<p>The most graphic summary of these issues is probably not Jared Diamond's 
<br>
recent effort, but a gorgeously illustrated children's book called &quot;A 
<br>
Street Through Time&quot;.  Do take a look at it next time you're in the 
<br>
bookstore.  Look at the page with the Roman street, c. 100 A.D.  Dwell 
<br>
for a moment on the plumbing, the fabulous stone buildings, murals on 
<br>
the walls, central heating, shops, etc.  Then look at the next picture, 
<br>
and the next, and the next, for about another 1,600 years.
<br>
<p>If there was ever a reason to stop pissing into the wind with the AGI 
<br>
stuff and get down to business, that little kids' book pretty much sums 
<br>
it up.
