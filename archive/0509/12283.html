<p><p>Last I checked, quantum theory does not allow information to move faster
<br>
than the speed of light.  Being able to absolutely guarantee synchronicity
<br>
between any two points in space at any specific moment in time is the
<br>
computer scientist's wet dream.  That we pretend we can do such things does
<br>
not mean that we actually can.  All we can really do is reduce the
<br>
probability of an incorrect state with clever tricks, like error
<br>
detection/correction that can handle a subset of possible failures.
<br>
<p>IIRC, the inability to guarantee correctness of state was discussed in GEB
<br>
albeit obliquely.

<p><p><em>&gt; If a brain was so large that one region could only produce output that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine a resulting consciousness which experienced a consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history, but was able to experience &quot;moments&quot; lasting less than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time taken to achieve consistency between brain areas.
</em><br>
<p><p>One of the basic mechanisms of distributed computing is having every locale
<br>
have a consistent view of history, even if it is on a different point of the
<br>
timeline than other locales in some absolute context.  The mark of a
<br>
generally effective distributed processing system is that if you turned off
<br>
all external input there is a very high probability that it would eventually
<br>
settle into a globally consistent state.  It is worth pointing out that
<br>
databases like Oracle or PostgreSQL do exactly this as well to guarantee
<br>
correctness on single processors with high-concurrency (virtual parallelism)
<br>
and an extremely high probability of correctness.  The modern Multi-Version
<br>
Concurrency Control (MVCC) family of algorithms is a distributed processing
<br>
algorithm designed to approximately guarantee eventual global consistency
<br>
even in single address spaces, never mind networked systems.  And in fact,
<br>
databases do give every user a consistent tidy view of the database, but
<br>
often two different users will have different inconsistent views that are
<br>
nonetheless internally consistent for each user.  As is in evidence, this
<br>
usually works out very well in practice despite the fact that different
<br>
views in the system are operating on different points in the database's
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>For many purposes, significant synchronization latencies will not impact the
<br>
correct functioning or consistency of the overall system as viewed from any
<br>
given point in the system.  However, synchronization latencies will impact
<br>
the overall throughput and intelligence of the system.
