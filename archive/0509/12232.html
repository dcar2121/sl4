Eli:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  I bet that if you name three subtleties, I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; describe how Bayes plus expected utility plus Solomonoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (= AIXI) would do it given infinite computing power.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, but who cares what can be done using infinite computing power?
<br>
<p>The question is whether probabilistic inference plus an Occam's Razor
<br>
assumption is a good approach to achieving intelligence given *very finite*
<br>
computing power, which is what our seed AI's will most likely actually
<br>
have...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First off, you didn't answer my challenge.  Name three subtleties, heck,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name one subtlety, and see what I make of it.
</em><br>
<p>I am curious how you propose to handle Hempel's paradox of confirmation
<br>
using probabilistic semantics alone.
<br>
<p>In PTL (Novamente's probabilistic inference component) we handle this sort
<br>
of thing via augmenting probability theory with other mathematics.
<br>
<p>There are many solutions to this problem, but I'm curious which one you
<br>
advocate...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Give me one good, solid, predictive equation applying to cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems that stems from CAS.
</em><br>
<p>Well, Wolfram's division of cellular automata into
<br>
<p>-- stable
<br>
-- periodic
<br>
-- chaotic
<br>
-- complex
<br>
<p>led to the notion of &quot;complexity at the edge of chaos&quot;, which is the idea
<br>
that in the &quot;parameter space&quot; of CA's, complex CA's are generally found in
<br>
the region of parameter space between the region corresponding to periodic
<br>
CA's and the region corresponding to complex CA's.  This rule often seems to
<br>
hold for other complex systems besides CA's as well.
<br>
<p>This observation is predictive in the sense that, if one knows a bunch of
<br>
systems of a certain type (e.g. CA's) and knows their parameters as well as
<br>
their dynamical category, then when one is given a new example system, one
<br>
can guess the dynamical category of the new example system with an accuracy
<br>
much better than random.
<br>
<p>Another example is Michel Baranger's principle of Maximum Entropy
<br>
Production, which states that in many complex systems, dynamics occurs in
<br>
such a way as to maximize the rate of entropy production.  Note that this
<br>
goes beyond the second law of thermodynamics, and is NOT universal.
<br>
Baranger showed that it occurred in a simple model system (the Benard cell)
<br>
and gave some math showing why it will often hold.  I recently read an
<br>
article in Nature which did not cite Baranger but which proposed his same
<br>
principle and showed that it applied to climate change in many cases.  This
<br>
is predictive because it allows one to predict that, given a complex system
<br>
one knows little about, the odds are decent that it will approximately
<br>
follow a path of near maximum entropy production rate.
<br>
<p>Neither of these is a definite, hard and fast, universal rule -- they are
<br>
probabilistic generalizations that seem to hold across &quot;most&quot; complex
<br>
systems.  If one is given a complex system to study, and isn't given much
<br>
data about it, these principles definitely allow one to make crude judgments
<br>
about that system -- &quot;better than random.&quot;  But they are no substitute for
<br>
detailed analysis of particular systems, they only provide general guidance.
<br>
<p>This may not be the kind of science that you want for AGI design or FAI
<br>
theory, but it's still real science and it's interesting.  I think there are
<br>
probably ideas in complexity science that are useful for pointing the way to
<br>
more specific and rigorous conclusions about specific classes of AGI
<br>
systems.
<br>
