</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joel
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that's a proper description of what chaotic is. Chaos
<br>
doesn't mean &quot;without rules&quot;, but rather it means that the behaviour
<br>
of the system is obviously derivable from the rules. The states are
<br>
chaotic in that it would be exceedingly difficult to predict from
<br>
knowledge of the initial conditions of the system what the precise
<br>
state of the system would be sometimes in the future. The
<br>
predictability of a car comes not from a bottom-up understanding of
<br>
all interacting components, but rather from grokking what the stable
<br>
patterns are.
<br>
<p>Chaos theory, insofar as I qualitatively understand it, is all about
<br>
that kind of behaviour. It is not just a blanket claim that &quot;you can't
<br>
understand complex things&quot;, but rather that the right way of thinking
<br>
about complex systems is in terms of stable and unstable patterns, etc.
<br>
<p>Whether a car really is a complex system or not, I agree, is a pretty
<br>
flimsy kind of claim, because its' components are too predicable. But
<br>
certainly thinking about a car's details -- such as which piston will
<br>
fire at time X, what the oil level will be etc etc is the kind of
<br>
specific claim that chaos theory says is impossible. Saying that the
<br>
pistons fire to drive the main shaft is the kind of &quot;pattern&quot;
<br>
behaviour that chaos theory talks about. It's difficult to address the
<br>
fine details, and easy to analyse the super-behaviour of the systems.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
