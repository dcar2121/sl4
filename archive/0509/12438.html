<em>&gt; &quot;Singularity&quot; sounds insane to most people and hence fails on point a), and

<em>&gt; Oh, well.

<p>I'm not so sure about all this now. I'm starting to lean toward the idea that 
<br>
the Singularity will become essentially required reading for anyone in business, 
<br>
technology, science, etc. It seems unavoidable as time progresses... there are 
<br>
too many smart people pushing the idea now already to avoid it.
<br>
<p>An example that I was surprised to see recently is that last Friday night John 
<br>
Mauldin started covering the Singularity/TSIN in his free investing email 
<br>
newsletter. He's got well over a million subscribers last I heard, and since he 
<br>
sent that newsletter the book jumped up into the top 25 books at Amazon and has 
<br>
pretty much stayed there. 5 years ago it was hard for me to imagine that a book 
<br>
purely about the Singularity would be in the top 25 Amazon books, but now we're 
<br>
here... where will it be in another 5 years?
<br>
<p>If you want to temporarily sign up for that newsletter and see the back issue 
<br>
you can go to <a href="http://www.2000wave.com/">http://www.2000wave.com/</a> - after giving them your email (or a fake 
<br>
email) you will see TSIN is the top subject right now. He's going to keep 
<br>
covering this in his next 1 or 2 newsletters as well because he thinks it's very 
<br>
important.
<br>
<p>I think this is the beginning of spreading the meme throughout the mainstream 
<br>
investment and business world's thinkers. It will still take years even though 
<br>
ideas spread quickly nowadays, but by the end of the decade I expect it may be 
<br>
accepted or at least known by most. It will also be interesting to see if 
<br>
additional Singularity gurus pop up over the next few years in addition to 
<br>
Kurzweil and other known personalities.
