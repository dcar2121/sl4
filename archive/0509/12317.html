<p><em>&gt; Wei Dai, you are correct.  Mathematical reasoning is not usually regarded

</em><br>

<p>I'm aware of &quot;impossible possible worlds&quot;, but as far as I can tell, there 
<br>
hasn't been much work done in that direction beyond setting up some 
<br>
formalism. It doesn't seem to offer any insight into how informal 
<br>
mathematical reasoning actually works (i.e., how we come to believe some 
<br>
unproved mathematical conjectures but not others).
<br>
<p>Another direction, taken by Marcus Hutter's AIXI-tl and Schmidhuber's Godel 
<br>
Machine, is to essentially hard wire difficult-to-prove/unprovable 
<br>
mathematical conjectures into the AI as unchangeable assumptions. This may 
<br>
not be obvious at first glance so I'll explain. The way those AIs work is to 
<br>
start with an initial policy (handcrafted program for making decisions) and 
<br>
then systematically search for provable improvements to the policy. The 
<br>
initial policy necessarily makes implicit or explicit assumptions about the 
<br>
truth value of mathematical conjectures. Such an assumption can't be changed 
<br>
unless it can be proved to be false, otherwise it's impossible to prove that 
<br>
changing it won't lower expected utility.
<br>
<p>I'm curious what others think about how important this problem is. I know 
<br>
that in my own field of cryptography, heavy use is made of informal 
<br>
mathematical reasoning, since it has not be possible to invent ciphers that 
<br>
can be proven to be computationally hard to break (this would require P!=NP 
<br>
at a minimum). Likewise in cryptanalysis, many important algorithms can not 
<br>
be proven to be correct and/or only have heuristic running times.
<br>
<p>One might argue that the problem isn't important, because an AI with much 
<br>
greater computational resources than we do will be able to easily prove or 
<br>
disprove any mathematical conjectures that might be practically relevant. 
<br>
But it's not obvious this will be the case. Gregory Chaitin has argued that 
<br>
many interesting or natural mathematical questions may be independent of the 
<br>
usual axioms (see <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/unm2.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/unm2.html</a>). He 
<br>
advocates that mathematics should be &quot;quasi-empirical&quot; and done more like 
<br>
physics. I think this is already the case to a great extent, especially in 
<br>
applied math, but we don't seem to know how to formalize the process so an 
<br>
AI can also do this.
