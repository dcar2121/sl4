<em>&gt;  Ben, I don't think you have a strong grasp on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian probability theory &quot;as traditionally deployed&quot; - at the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least you need more practice applying it to example problems before you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop a decent feel for it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, Eli, I don't think you have a strong grasp on my psyche or my
<br>
knowledge of mathematics ;-)
<br>
<p>I was the 7-year-old kid who could do all sorts of advanced algebra but
<br>
still vexed his teachers by sometimes making dumb careless mistakes in
<br>
addition problems!
<br>
<p>But anyway, your set of misconceptions about my personal strengths and
<br>
weaknesses is not a very generally interesting topic, so I don't think I
<br>
will pursue it on this list...
<br>
<p>Let me just say this: I have pursuing a pretty interesting train of thought
<br>
about the nature of evidence, and I'm pretty confident it will lead to
<br>
something interesting and valuable in the end.  However, this interesting
<br>
train of thought seems to have led me to some incorrect ways of analyzing
<br>
situations (which contradict my own PTL probability-math formalism, in
<br>
fact), as an interim effect....  Ah well.  Anyway if this germinal,
<br>
at this point still flaky way of thinking about evidence turns up anything
<br>
demonstrably valuable, I'll let you know...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also don't think it's fair to characterize Fitelson's paper as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticism arguing that &quot;traditional&quot; Bayesian analysis relies on hidden,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unacceptable assumptions.  There are many published works on Hempel's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradox by authors trying to work within the Bayesian tradition.  Those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have seen tend to do a decent job of stating their assumptions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; albeit not with the rigor shown by the best Bayesians such as Jaynes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fitelson is not criticizing those analyses, he is strengthening a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain result by weakening its assumptions.  The part where Fitelson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tries to characterize the standard assumption as overly strong, is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much criticism of traditionally deployed Bayesian probability theory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Fitelson trying to show that his new result is interesting.
</em><br>
<p>The big challenge in that little corner of research seems to have been
<br>
making
<br>
the assumptions weak enough that the mathematical formalization of the
<br>
problem can fairly be considered as matching the intuitive statement of
<br>
the problem.  According to my own judgment (and I realize this is
<br>
a subjective thing) the earlier  papers I read didn't meet this criterion
<br>
very well, but Fitelson's paper basically does, which is interesting to me.
<br>
<p>I only surveyed the literature haphazardly though...
<br>
<p>--Ben
