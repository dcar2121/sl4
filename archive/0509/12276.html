</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I was loose with my language. They are, in principle, able to
<br>
be predicted, viz they are deterministic. It is the deviation and
<br>
error which makes them difficult to actually predict.
<br>
<p>Chaos theory, I thought, was predominantly related to the emergent
<br>
patterns, organisation, attractors and repulsors which are
<br>
identifiable in many (most?) chaotic systems. I read a book on this
<br>
topic, which (as I am a bear of little brain) was right at my level
<br>
being primarily qualitative with a smattering of maths.
<br>
<p>It was using examples of state change in systems, the patterns of
<br>
variables making a random walk, etc etc to describe real systems at
<br>
the level of patterns and tendencies.
<br>
<p>I really thought that Chaos theory was not about &quot;giving up&quot; on making
<br>
predictions, but rather a description of the kinds of claims that we
<br>
can make about deterministic but practically indeterminable systems.
<br>
<p>As applied to something like AI, for example, or neural network
<br>
propagation, or idea propagation, or the presence of any particular
<br>
population or identifiable set within a possibility space, this is
<br>
basically referring to the patterns that we can expect to find. It is
<br>
less concerned with how to move from detail to complete prediction,
<br>
and rather offers us a set of tools for analysing things at a higher
<br>
level.
<br>
<p>For example, if we designed an AI, which was implemented as a complex
<br>
system, we could expect to see features within that AI, some of which
<br>
will be robust, some which will be fragile etc. We should expect to
<br>
see state changes whereby there are critical points at which change
<br>
will propagate very rapidly throughout the entire system, even though
<br>
it was previously stable.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
