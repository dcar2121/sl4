<em>&gt; &gt; IMO assigment of credit is a good example of an AI problem that no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one has figured out how to parallelize effectively yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Traditional AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approaches to assignment of credit such as Q-learning, Holland's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classifiers, or Baum's Hayek are elegantly parallel in nature, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; highly ineffective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you give some reason why you say this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is important.
</em><br>
<p>That these methods are highly ineffective is well-known.  None of them
<br>
really works, which is why none has been used as the foundation of any
<br>
reasonably functional narrow AI system let alone AGI system.
<br>
<p>The hypothesis that centralized techniques can work better is the
<br>
controversial one, and I haven't yet proved it.
<br>
<p>The basic concept is that assignment of credit should be treated as a
<br>
data-mining problem.  Keep a centralized record of all activities within a
<br>
system, including goal achievement.  Then mine this record to learn patterns
<br>
of activity that are predictive of goal achievement, and do inference on the
<br>
mined patterns to guess better patterns than the data-mining algorithm is
<br>
able to find.  The details regard what sort of data mining and reasoning
<br>
algorithms to use, and what sort of data structure to use for the
<br>
centralized record; the Novamente design contains specifics in this regard.
<br>
<p>Basically, parallel, self-organizing assignment of credit algorithms are
<br>
trying to do this kind of data mining, but they're doing a bad job even
<br>
compared to traditional data mining algorithms, because they are trying to
<br>
do it via funky massively parallel self-organizing methods that don't work
<br>
and IMO make the problem seem harder than it really is.
<br>
<p>The brain may well use some funky massively parallel self-organizing method,
<br>
but it has a lot of neurons to waste ;-)
