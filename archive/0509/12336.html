<em>&gt; Ben, just to be clear on this, do you mean that, under PTL, and under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own view of probability, sampling a random non-black object, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding that it is not a raven, should count as no evidence in favor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proposition that all ravens are black?  Given, we shall say, that at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one raven exists, and that the *ratio* of ravens to nonravens is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater than zero.  And again to be clear, by &quot;evidence&quot; I am trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get at the Bayesian concept of evidence:  After sampling a random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonblack object and finding it to not be a raven, would you/PTL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase, or not increase, the odds at which you would be willing to bet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;All ravens are black&quot; is true of the sample space?
</em><br>
<p>Eli,
<br>
<p>First a general contextualizing statement: I am pretty confident in the PTL
<br>
mathematics, but less so in my interpretation and application of that
<br>
mathematics &quot;by hand.&quot;  PTL is new and the art of applying it to various
<br>
situations is still a young one.
<br>
<p>Now, to answer your question.  My current thinking is that, given only the
<br>
information you've provided, I WOULD increase the odds, just like you would.
<br>
In other words, it seems on reflection that the PTL approach is more
<br>
consistent with the standard Bayesian approach than I'd thought, but that in
<br>
my prior e-mail I was not applying the PTL math carefully enough.
<br>
<p>In fact, this seems to be a case where the Novamente PTL implementation
<br>
would come up with a different answer than I originally did, via applying
<br>
the rules in a way that took into account all information ;-)  Maybe we'll
<br>
try the experiment, it wouldn't be hard to feed in the data...
<br>
<p>Specifically, in my reply to Jeff Medina, I was not taking into account his
<br>
&quot;special assumption&quot; that at least one raven exists in the assumed-finite
<br>
sample space.
<br>
<p>The PTL &quot;amount of evidence&quot; inference equation I gave in my prior email is
<br>
<p>N_raven = N_(non-black) P(raven|non-black)
<br>
<p>What I said there was
<br>
<p>****
<br>
So if we've observed 499 non-black entities and none of them are ravens
<br>
(they're all purple geese, or orange orgasmotrons, or whatever), then we
<br>
have
<br>
<p>N_(non-black) = 499
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>P(raven|non-black) = 0
<br>
<p>thus an inferred
<br>
<p>N_raven = 0
<br>
<p>So, the amount of evidence about P(non-black|raven) [or P(black|raven)]
<br>
obtained from P(non-raven|black) is zero.
<br>
****
<br>
<p>However, if we assume that there is at least one raven in the finite sample
<br>
space, then it now seems to me this is not correct.  Under this assumption,
<br>
we have a situation where one of the two possibilities hold:
<br>
<p>-- we have not yet looked at all the non-black items in the sample space,
<br>
and so there are some non-black items where it's still unknown whether
<br>
they're ravens or not.  But since we know there is at least one raven and
<br>
have no prior certain knowledge that this raven is black, then our estimate
<br>
of P(raven|non-black) should be &gt; 0 based on our total knowledge.
<br>
<p>-- we have looked at all the non-black items in the sample space (because
<br>
there was as it happened only one), and have observed that there are no
<br>
non-black items there.  But in this case there must be a black raven, since
<br>
there is a raven, and so in this branch we know P(raven|non-black)&gt;0
<br>
<p>Thus in either of these branches P(raven|non-black) &gt; 0, and
<br>
<p>N_raven &gt; 0
<br>
<p>according to the PTL evidence formula, unlike what I said before.
<br>
<p>So, in conclusion, according to PTL applied correctly, we may say:
<br>
<p>&quot;The observation of a nonblack nonraven in a population known to be finite
<br>
and *known to contain at least one raven* may be considered as a small
<br>
amount of evidence in favor of the existence of a black raven in that
<br>
population.&quot;
<br>
<p>Without the assumption that the population is known to contain at least one
<br>
raven, then the argument I've given above fails.
<br>
<p>However, it can be made to succeed if one adds various other special
<br>
assumptions, of course.  For instance, if one assumes that P(raven) &gt;0 and
<br>
that raven-ness and blackness are independent, then a variant of the above
<br>
argument obviously works.
<br>
<p>I don't, at the moment, see any way to make the above argument work without
<br>
making SOME special assumption in addition to the finiteness of the
<br>
population.  This is consistent with my original statement about Hempel's
<br>
paradox, but I erred by overlooking the way the introduction of the one
<br>
black raven changes the situation, from a PTL perspective.
<br>
<p>Anyway, this has been an interesting thread.  In fact it's pleasing for me
<br>
to see that PTL's evidence algebra is agreeable with traditionally-applied
<br>
probability theory in this instance.  (However, I do sorta wish I could get
<br>
myself to think harder before replying to emails on technical topics ;-)
<br>
