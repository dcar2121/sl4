<p>How do you know that current tools are terribly inadequate or that

incredibly sophisticated tools are required if you are incapable of even

specifying the engineering problem they need to solve?
<br>
<p>Now, it may yet turn out that some uber-tool is required that we have not
<br>
thought of, but until you specify the problem you are going to use the tools
<br>
to solve you won't be able to prove it nor make useful progress on
<br>
developing a helpful tool.  I am personally doubtful that such a tool is
<br>
missing.  If it can't be done with a C compiler (not that you necessarily
<br>
would want to), it can't be done at all.  Most of what is missing in the
<br>
software world is nice integration and the implementation convenience of &quot;do
<br>
what I mean, not what I say&quot;, which largely amounts to a sugary frosting
<br>
layer on the computer science cake.
