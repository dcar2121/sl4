<em>&gt; So, in conclusion, according to PTL applied correctly, we may say:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The observation of a nonblack nonraven in a population known to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be finite and *known to contain at least one raven* may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered as a small amount of evidence in favor of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of a black raven in that population.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without the assumption that the population is known to contain at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one raven, then the argument I've given above fails.  
</em><br>
<p>Or maybe not... actually, now that I think about it again, it seems
<br>
that if one doesn't assume the one raven in the population,
<br>
but merely assumes a fractional raven (i.e. a &gt;0 probability of
<br>
there being a raven) then the argument may still hold.
<br>
<p>But anyway, to get back to where this thread started
<br>
<p>-- As it turns out standard probabilistic semantics and PTL say
<br>
basically the same thing about Hempel's paradox, though they
<br>
express it in different ways.  This is interesting to me,
<br>
though in the big picture not surprising.  PTL was created in
<br>
order to formula probabilistic ideas in a way convenient for
<br>
AGI, not to contradict probability theory.  
<br>
<p>-- My issue with probability theory as a foundation for AI has
<br>
to do with its inability to deal with some issues in a
<br>
computationally efficient way, without the addition of a 
<br>
significant amount of additional concepts.  The main
<br>
examples I have in mind here are attention allocation in
<br>
a complex cognitive system, assignment of credit, concept
<br>
creation, and the learning of schemata for the control
<br>
of inference trajectories.  These things certainly can be done
<br>
in a way that's *consistent* with probability theory, but,
<br>
seem to require the addition of a lot of structures and
<br>
dynamics that are not suggested by probability theory.
<br>
<p>-- Where complex systems dynamics (as Loosemore was mentioning)
<br>
come in, in the Novamente design, is in dealing with some of
<br>
these things that are not efficiently dealt with by probability
<br>
theory alone.  In all these cases, the role of non-probability-theory
<br>
mechanisms may be placed into the category of &quot;hypothesis 
<br>
generation&quot;, if one wants to use a Bayesian-type terminology...
<br>
<p>-- So, then, my contention is that in complex AI systems, complex
<br>
emergent dynamics are very useful for hypothesis generation; and 
<br>
the hypotheses generated via these mechanisms can then be fed into
<br>
probabilistic inference mechanisms
<br>
<p>-- Finally, my contention is that the brain largely works this way,
<br>
even though it's not explicitly thought of in such a way.  The brain
<br>
works this way because Hebbian learning is essentially an imprecise
<br>
and distributed way of doing some simple forms of probabilistic
<br>
inference.
