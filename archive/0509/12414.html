<p>
Not to be picky or anything, but people are starting to use the phrase 
<br>
&quot;complexity theory&quot; as if it were synonymous with &quot;complex systems&quot;.
<br>
<p>My understanding is that &quot;complexity theory&quot; already has a strongly 
<br>
entrenched usage:  it refers to the calculation of algorithmic complexity.
<br>
<p>Okay, so I just checked the Wikipedia, and apparently there is now 
<br>
ambiguity in the usage (don't you just hate it when the language starts 
<br>
to shift around underneath you?).
<br>
<p>It would help though, to stick to the standard, since in our context 
<br>
both meanings could be relevant, and someone coming fresh to this 
<br>
discussion is sooner or later going to be completely confused about what 
<br>
we are talking about.
<br>
<p>[I won't even *begin* to discuss the fact that when people say 
<br>
&quot;complexity theory&quot; and yet mean &quot;complex systems&quot; they *then* often 
<br>
proceed to talk about chaos theory instead.  Sigh :-) ]
<br>
<p>Complexity theory (from Wikipedia)
<br>
<p>&quot;Complexity theory can refer to more than one thing:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Computational complexity theory: a field in theoretical computer 
<br>
science and mathematics dealing with the resources required during 
<br>
computation to solve a given problem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The theoretical treatment of descriptive complexity (or 
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity) of a string is studied in algorithmic information 
<br>
theory by identifying the length of the shortest binary program which 
<br>
can output that string.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Systems theory (or systemics or general systems theory): an 
<br>
interdisciplinary field including engineering, biology and philosophy 
<br>
that incorporates science to study large systems
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Complexity theory is sometimes used as a broad term addressing 
<br>
the study of complex systems, including subjects such as chaos theory, 
<br>
artificial life, and genetic algorithms.&quot;
