</em><br>
<em>&gt; go off with the estimated yield.
</em><br>
<p><p>Both of these estimates are inflated in any case -- what either the US or
<br>
the Russians could actually deliver would be substantially less.  As you
<br>
mention, it is widely believed that a substantial fraction of the Russian
<br>
nuclear force is non-operable due to lack of maintenance and general decay.
<br>
They have gobs of fissile material, but it would probably have to be
<br>
recycled in many cases to perform as intended.  A lot of the Russian fissile
<br>
material is sitting around rotting, since they do not have money to either
<br>
destroy it or keep it fresh.  The US has been actively destroying nuclear
<br>
weapons and recycling the material or converting it into reactor fuel.
<br>
<p>The aggregate yield numbers that are commonly used were guesstimated by
<br>
people and organizations with an ideological interest in making the arsenals
<br>
seem as large as possible.  Neither country publishes precise data, and the
<br>
disarmament negotiations were based on third-party data for what both
<br>
countries had.  IIRC, the US has already achieved the goals of the nuclear
<br>
disarmament terms it agreed to, but Russia is behind on its obligation and
<br>
its nuclear disarmament is being funded primarily by the US government.
<br>
<p><p>Rather than producing more deployed nuclear weapons, the US has been
<br>
recycling the fissile material from decommissioned nukes into tiny plutonium
<br>
triggers which are put into storage (which are normally counted as a nuclear
<br>
weapon for accounting purposes).  If the US wanted to make a nuclear weapon,
<br>
they install the trigger on an otherwise inert thermonuclear device.  The
<br>
yield of a plutonium trigger is on the scale of a large conventional
<br>
explosion, making the broader nuclear arsenal much safer and cleaner since
<br>
most of the &quot;nuclear weapons&quot; in the US arsenal are inert with the triggers
<br>
stored elsewhere and in a fashion that an accidental nuclear event won't
<br>
cause major damage.  Very similar to how detonators are kept separate from
<br>
high explosives to minimize the damage possible in an accident and to allow
<br>
much more flexibility in the actual usage.
<br>
<p>For this reason, in a surprise attack scenario only a fraction of the US
<br>
nuclear arsenal could be deployed, as many of the nukes the US nominally
<br>
possesses are trigger assemblies that have not been installed and could not
<br>
be with only a few minutes notice.  On the upside, the US has been reducing
<br>
the amount of plutonium it keeps around to the bare minimum required to
<br>
function as triggers, which reduces several types of risk.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Get off the nuclear weapons fixation already.  It is a relatively minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; threat to your survival -- you are far more likely to be killed by a nasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; virus than a nuke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How bad does a virus need to be to have the same effect on the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy as a nuclear exchange?
</em><br>
<p><p>Any virus bad enough that physical human-to-human interaction and travel
<br>
dwindles will put a significant damper on the economy.  One of the nice
<br>
things about nuclear weapons is that the real damage is pretty localized.
<br>
Look at what SARS did to the Asian economies in a matter of weeks, and that
<br>
was an insignificant virus in the big scheme of things.  Something nasty and
<br>
global, like a particularly bad influenza variant, could hinder the free
<br>
flow of goods and services on a spectacular scale.
