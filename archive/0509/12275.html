<em>&gt; &gt; My conjecture is that any useful mechanism of hypothesis search inserted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically into the inference mechanism involved in attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allocation /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inference control, is going to introduce complex dynamics that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; render the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system extremely difficult to predict.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That depends on *what* you're trying to predict.  Let's say you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; searching the inference space of axiomatic derivations in ZF set theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   No matter what kind of bizarre probabilistic searches you use to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control your inferences, if the space is of legitimate derivations, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can remain confident that the result is a legitimate proof.  This is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prediction that matters, even if you can't predict how exactly the proof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will work.
</em><br>
<p>True enough.
<br>
<p>And one obvious question is then whether the Friendliness or otherwise of
<br>
the system is tractable to predict...
<br>
<p>Your point about the predictability of provability is correct, but
<br>
provability is weak as an analogue to Friendliness.
<br>
<p>Because, in the case of an AI system of which crisp logic is a subset,
<br>
provability is wired into the AI system; whereas it's not at all clear how
<br>
to wire something as nebulous as Friendliness into the axioms of an AI
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>In this context, one point (which you have clearly already figured out, but
<br>
others on the list may not have) is:
<br>
<p>* If Friendliness is an emergent property of the AI system (which is the
<br>
case with human friendliness, almost surely), then it is going to be
<br>
susceptible to the type of unpredictability I've mentioned above (and other
<br>
types too I would suppose)
<br>
<p>* If Friendliness is somehow wired into the logic of the AI system at the
<br>
most fundamental level, so that each step of the system contains a
<br>
Friendliness-check, then it may be possible to make Friendliness predictable
<br>
in roughly the sense that provability is in your analogy
<br>
<p><p>Another point, which you may or may not agree with, is:
<br>
<p>* If Friendliness is to be achieved within feasible computational resources
<br>
(it will need to be emergent to at least a large extent, though not
<br>
necessarily completely)
<br>
<p>So, my intuition is that
<br>
<p>-- to be feasible, Friendliness must be emergent
<br>
-- to be predictable, Friendliness must be wired into the system logic
<br>
<p>The problem of Friendly AI engineering then becomes one of creating a system
<br>
with Friendliness wired into the logic, but with a design tailored to cause
<br>
Friendliness to emerge.  The coordination between the wired-in Friendliness
<br>
and the emergent Friendliness has got to allow the provability of
<br>
probabilistic theorems about the emergent Friendliness.  Is this possible?
<br>
I really don't know...
<br>
<p>There are deeper things to say in this vein, but then the conversation would
<br>
get a lot more technical and the emails would take a lot longer to write.
<br>
