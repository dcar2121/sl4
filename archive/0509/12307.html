Eli,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Googling on Hempel + Bayes turns up some standard responses, for example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Hempel first pointed out that we typically expect the hypothesis that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all ravens are black to be confirmed to some degree by the observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a black raven, but not by the observation of a non-black, non-raven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let H be the hypothesis that all ravens are black. Let E1 describe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation of a non-black, non-raven. Let E2 describe the observation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a black raven. Bayesian Confirmation Theory actually holds that both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; E1 and E2 may provide some confirmation for H. Recall that E1 supports H
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just in case Pi(E1/H)/Pi(E1) &gt; 1. It is plausible to think that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratio is ever so slightly greater than one. On the other hand, E2 would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to provide much greater confirmation to H, because, in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, it would be expected that Pi(E2/H)/Pi(E2) &gt;&gt; Pi(E1/H)/Pi(E1).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A fine answer so far as it goes, though really it is only half the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution.
</em><br>
<p>IMO this is *not* a fine answer, it's a dodge of the issue.
<br>
<p>The problem is that what is logically correct is that an observation of
<br>
a non-black non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis
<br>
that all ravens are black.
<br>
<p>If probability theory as standardly deployed states that an observation
<br>
of a non-black non-raven provides a NON-ZERO amount of evidence toward
<br>
the hypothesis that all ravens are black, then this shows there is
<br>
something wrong with probability theory as standardly deployed.
<br>
<p>Of cousre, an approach that yields small errors may still be valuable
<br>
for practical AI purposes.
<br>
<p>However, what frustrates me about the quote you cite, and your attitude,
<br>
is that you seem to be denying that probability theory as standardly
<br>
deployed is conceptually and logically erroneous in this case -- albeit
<br>
the magnitude of its error is generally small.
<br>
<p>Your followup comments are intelligent and well-thought-out, but, they
<br>
don't really solve the problems with the attempted solution given in
<br>
the paragraph you cite above.
<br>
<p>I believe the Hempel problem is handled more artfully in Novamente.
<br>
<p>In PTL, we can estimate the truth value of
<br>
<p>ForAll x { is_raven(x) ==&gt; is_black(x) }
<br>
<p>as a transform of the truth value of
<br>
<p>P( is_black(x) | is_raven(x) )
<br>
<p>[the simplest rule for this is, e.g. s^N estimates the probability
<br>
of the former statement where s is an estimate of the probability
<br>
of the latter statement and N defines the amount of (explicit or
<br>
implicit) evidence used  to arrive at s].
<br>
<p>The definition of evidence in PTL makes clear that the only evidence
<br>
that counts for
<br>
<p>P( is_black(x) | is_raven(x) )
<br>
<p>is the set of x for which is_raven(x) has a nonzero truth value,
<br>
and therefore Hempel's paradox does not exist.
<br>
<p>The key point is that PTL explicitly defines the concept of evidence
<br>
and keeps track of the evidence in favor of each statement.  Evidence
<br>
is defined as something separate from probability, though related
<br>
to probability.  Basically, the evidence in favor of an assertion is
<br>
the &quot;number of observations&quot; made to estimate the probability of
<br>
the assertion.
<br>
<p>I realize these comments are only evocative rather than convincing,
<br>
which is pretty much inevitable given the constraints of expression
<br>
in a brief and semi-technical email.
<br>
<p>Pei Wang and I have recently written and submitted for publication
<br>
a paper arguing that, to be adequate, an uncertain logic system must
<br>
use at least two numbers to quantify truth value.  Examples of
<br>
uncertain logic systems using two numbers to quantify truth values
<br>
are:
<br>
<p>* Novamente's PTL framework
<br>
<p>* Pei Wang's NARS framework (which I have some serious issues with)
<br>
<p>* Walley's theory of interval probabilities (which I haven't explored
<br>
that fully, though it has some nice algebraic similarities to PTL
<br>
and NARS)
<br>
<p>I continue to believe that a purely probabilistic approach is not
<br>
adequate, but that if one augments probability theory by considering
<br>
truth values with more than one component (e.g. a &quot;weight of evidence&quot;
<br>
as well as a probability), then things work out more adequately
<br>
(though one still needs to introduce a bunch of heuristic approximations
<br>
to tractably handle real-world inferencing).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I shall now demonstrate the folly of adulterating Bayes with lesser wares.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that I know that, in a certain sample, there is at least one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; black raven, and at least one blue teapot, and some number of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ravens of unknown color.  I now observe an item from the group that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produced by the following sampling method:  Someone looks over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group, and if there are no non-black ravens, he tosses out a blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teapot.  If there are non-black ravens, he tosses out a black raven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now observing a black raven definitely shows that not all ravens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are black.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would Novamente's &quot;augmented&quot; probability theory handle that case, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder?
</em><br>
<p>Given the constraints you've introduced, the only way Novamente has to
<br>
handle this problem is to use &quot;higher-order inference&quot;, which means
<br>
to explicitly represent the definition of the problem in terms of
<br>
variables and quantifiers, in a manner similar to predicate logic.
<br>
<p>The difference is that, unlike standard predicate logic, Novamente has
<br>
formulas for managing uncertain truth values attached to quantified
<br>
logical formulae.
<br>
<p>I could write out the details of this example in Novamente formalism,
<br>
and may do so later as it's a moderately amusing exercise, but I don't
<br>
have time at the moment.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G.
