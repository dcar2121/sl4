<p>Correct. When engineers design systems, they make extensive use of
<br>
state relationships that act as compression functions, mapping a
<br>
large range of input states onto a smaller range of output states
<br>
(strictly, they enforce specific sharp or near sharp set constraints
<br>
on the state of the cause/input and the state of the effect/output).
<br>
Imagine a buffer in digital electronics. There is an infinite range
<br>
of input potentials, but all the input states below the threshold
<br>
cause an output of 0, while all the outputs above the threshold
<br>
result in an output of 1. The buffer has compressed a huge range of
<br>
input states down to two, or if you want to account for the slight
<br>
variances in output it has enforced the constraints 'input state
<br>
member of above_threshold -&gt; output state member of on_states'
<br>
and 'input state member of below_threshold -&gt; output state member
<br>
of off_states'. Practically the constraint will always very
<br>
slightly fuzzy, because below_threshold and above_threshold will be
<br>
fuzzy sets that aren't quite disjoint. But because we know that
<br>
on_states is a very small subset of above_threshold, and that
<br>
off_states is a small sharp subset of below_threshold, and that
<br>
these two /are/ disjoint, we can string indefinite numbers of logic
<br>
gates together and reliably predict the final state of any
<br>
cycle-free network. Synapses are similar but less reliable.
<br>
<p>The end result is that we can design highly ordered systems (and
<br>
highly useful) systems by employing state space compression. These
<br>
systems can be combined by deductive reasoning into supersystems
<br>
that we can reliably predict will work before we actually build
<br>
them, wheras if we were working with chaos we'd wouldn't be able
<br>
to improve much on trial-and-error.
<br>
<p>Now the curious thing about AGIs are that they are the ultimate
<br>
in state compression functions. When Eliezer talks about
<br>
building a 'really powerful optimisation process', he is talking
<br>
about building a system that will (reliably) squeeze all the
<br>
probability mass in the PDF over possible future histories into
<br>
a small subset that the goal system defines as desireable. This
<br>
is the very definition of 'goal seeking process'; a process
<br>
which predictably tends to steer the state of the world into
<br>
desireable states, though the intermediate states and means it
<br>
uses to do that may not be so predictable.
<br>
<p>In a Bayesian AGI, absolutely everything happens because it is
<br>
suspected of helping to achieve some goal. This is what 'causally
<br>
clean' means, and it means that the kind of predictability that
<br>
applies to the AGI as a whole continues to apply on a more local
<br>
scale as you drill down into the components. An AGI which
<br>
generates actions by a less rigorous mechanism will probably not
<br>
show the same kind of predictability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When one tunes a car you adjust timing and other variables in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to get the emergent behaviour of a working car
</em><br>
<p>If a 'working car' is emergent behaviour, then the behaviour of
<br>
any system that is a collection of subcomponents is 'emergent'
<br>
(regardless of predictability), and the term becomes fairly useless.
