<p>
I've been reading and observing this discussion, and note that this may 
<br>
be the most fertile thread recently in terms of serious thought on all 
<br>
sides.  But the key point has been lost in the haze of warfare over 
<br>
implementation details and personal competencies.  No one has responded 
<br>
by demonstrating an encompassing understanding of the concept that was 
<br>
presented graciously and with the warning that apprehension of the big 
<br>
picture may be obscured by contests over the details.  No one has shown 
<br>
that they grasp the point being made within the context presented, and 
<br>
then, from that basis, that they might possibly point out what they see 
<br>
wrong with the concept.
<br>
<p>There is an arrogance and self-righteousness about this group that is 
<br>
ironic in its sincere desire to save all humankind.  The result is such 
<br>
that it misguidedly minimizes the search space in a manner very similar 
<br>
to the particular conceptual block which was intended to be illuminated 
<br>
in this thread.
<br>
<p>At a paradigmatic level, there is a conception of intelligence as the 
<br>
ability to affect desired change (desired from the POV of the agent) 
<br>
within a constrained and uncertain environment.  Any &quot;real&quot; and 
<br>
interesting environment is evolving in a complex (deterministic but 
<br>
unpredictable) way, and necessarily, the agent must be co-evolving if it 
<br>
is to survive.  (I am not referring to genetic evolution here, but 
<br>
rather the more fundamental ongoing process of synergetic growth, 
<br>
punctuated, occasional dead-ends, and all.)  My point (and I suspect it 
<br>
relates to the initial point of this thread) is that the very nature of 
<br>
creative intelligence within a co-evolving environment is such that the 
<br>
Self can not be invariant, and thus its goal(s) can not be invariant, if 
<br>
it is to persist and grow.
<br>
<p>No math here, and an imperfect linguistic representation, but a concept 
<br>
like many others that must remain in the realm of philosophy until our 
<br>
science of complex systems can make more explicit its (possible) 
<br>
applicability.  In the meantime, perhaps a concept worth considering 
<br>
since it may help us choose where to allocate our limited time and 
<br>
resources: attempting to create a single AI with the desirable but 
<br>
improbable property of Friendliness, or development of intelligence 
<br>
amplification technology across a broad base of humans already rooted in 
<br>
human morality but lacking the increased awareness to apply it 
<br>
effectively to our future.
