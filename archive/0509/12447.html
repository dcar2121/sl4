As I noted the other day on my site, John Tierney of the New York Times just 
<br>
wrote a piece called &quot;Human Beings 2.0&quot; and is discussing the book Radical 
<br>
Evolution on his online &quot;book club.&quot; You'll have to register with New York 
<br>
Times.Com (for free) and sign up for New York Times Select (free for two 
<br>
weeks and you can drop it) to read and send in your comments on these, but 
<br>
there they are.

<em>&gt; I'm not so sure about all this now. I'm starting to lean toward the idea 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Singularity will become essentially required reading for anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in business, technology, science, etc. It seems unavoidable as time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progresses... there are too many smart people pushing the idea now already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to avoid it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An example that I was surprised to see recently is that last Friday night 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Mauldin started covering the Singularity/TSIN in his free investing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email newsletter. He's got well over a million subscribers last I heard, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and since he sent that newsletter the book jumped up into the top 25 books 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at Amazon and has pretty much stayed there. 5 years ago it was hard for me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to imagine that a book purely about the Singularity would be in the top 25 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amazon books, but now we're here... where will it be in another 5 years?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to temporarily sign up for that newsletter and see the back 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue you can go to <a href="http://www.2000wave.com/">http://www.2000wave.com/</a> - after giving them your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; email (or a fake email) you will see TSIN is the top subject right now. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's going to keep covering this in his next 1 or 2 newsletters as well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because he thinks it's very important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is the beginning of spreading the meme throughout the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream investment and business world's thinkers. It will still take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years even though ideas spread quickly nowadays, but by the end of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade I expect it may be accepted or at least known by most. It will also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be interesting to see if additional Singularity gurus pop up over the next 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few years in addition to Kurzweil and other known personalities.
