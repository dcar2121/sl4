Hey Eli,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find your lack of faith disturbing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've got to sleep now, so this is a fine opportunity for aspiring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability theorists on SL4 to test their wings.  Props for anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points out flaws in Ben's reasoning before I write a response tomorrow.
</em><br>
<p>Well, my wife and I found the flaw in a brief conversation before we went to
<br>
sleep last night but I was really tired and I didn't feel like dealing with
<br>
the computer anymore ;)
<br>
<p>As she pointed out, the situation with states 2 and 4 in my little story
<br>
about the midget is a lot like the situation where you have two coins, one
<br>
with two heads and one regular coin with a head and a tail.  If you are told
<br>
that one has been tossed and the result was a head, then the odds are 2:1
<br>
that the the coin in question was the double-headed coin.  [The heads are
<br>
W's, the tail is a B]
<br>
<p>Duuuuhhh...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   These props are also available to Ben, but if he doesn't get it on his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own, and I have to write up the flaws myself, I want Ben to never again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim that Bayesian probability is quote wrong unquote.
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't every say something like &quot;probability theory is wrong&quot; -- it's a
<br>
branch of math and is correct assuming its axiom systems, just like any
<br>
other branch of math....  It's even a *very useful* branch of math which is
<br>
why Novamente is substantially based upon it....
<br>
<p>If you show me a particular theorem of probability theory I will always
<br>
agree it's right, assuming it's not above my algorithmic information to
<br>
verify it ;-)
<br>
<p>Issues of how to use probability theory to model some particular situation,
<br>
or whether it is the best tool to model some particular situation, are
<br>
different....  A way of using probability theory can be wrong even though
<br>
probability theory itself is not wrong.
<br>
<p>In this particular case (the Hempel paradox), the standard way of using
<br>
probability theory seems to be right ... but that doesn't mean everyone's
<br>
way of using probability theory will always be right....
<br>
<p>The real question about the Hempel paradox is not whether the probabilistic
<br>
analysis is mathematically correct, but whether the probabilistic notion of
<br>
&quot;evidence&quot; is the best one for formalizing the intuitive notion of evidence
<br>
underlying the Hempel paradox.  I had thought for a moment the answer was
<br>
&quot;no&quot;, but upon observing that my PTL notion of evidence (though formulated
<br>
differently) gives the same result as the standard probabilistic way of
<br>
thinking about evidence, I have had to reconsider.  This is interesting for
<br>
me, from a more general perspective, because it is causing me to revisit
<br>
various other aspects of PTL and observe the various connections between
<br>
them and more conventional ways of formulating things probabilistically....
<br>
My objective in designing PTL was to create a convenient way for applying
<br>
probability theory to AGI, and I think/hope it's succeeded in that, but I am
<br>
seeing that the PTL quest didn't lead quite as far from conventional ways of
<br>
probability theory as I was thinking....
<br>
<p>-- Ben
