Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Off-the-shelf distributed systems that you can put together for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modest cash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; today will spank the bejeezus out of a Thinking Machines CM-5 in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwidth, latency, and of course raw crunch.  Moore's law and all that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can replicate the model in your basement for not much money, given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good reason to.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course this is true.  And of course, this is not the most effective
<br>
way of using modern computing hardware.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, people designing MP-based MIMD infrastructure systems will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solving the same kinds of problems you were solving on a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Connection Machine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly since the MP fabric is actually more capable than those old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines.
</em><br>
<p>As it happens, the things I was doing with the CM-5 were fairly simple,
<br>
basically involving solving numerical analysis problems.  This was the 
<br>
case with most CM applications, the killer app was fluid dynamics 
<br>
simulation.
<br>
<p>However, the problems involved with implementing numerical analysis
<br>
algorithms OR infrastructure-type problems on an MIMD parallel substrate
<br>
are quite different from those involved with implementing AGI on an MIMD
<br>
parallel substrate.
<br>
<p>Having said that, I should add that it would not be hard at all to modify
<br>
the Novamente architecture for an MIMD substrate.  This would involve
<br>
many changes but most of them would be for the better.  In fact we've had
<br>
to bend over backward to make the Novamente math and concepts match up 
<br>
with the distributed-computing-over-a-small-network-of-von-Neumann-machines
<br>
hardware we have available.  The math and concepts would mostly match up
<br>
more simply with an MIMD parallel infrastructure.  Although an ideal
<br>
practical hardware infrastructure would have a mixture, with a large MIMD 
<br>
component as well as a very powerful traditional serial-computing 
<br>
component (because there are some parts of the design that don't 
<br>
parallelize as nicely as others).
<br>
<p>Specifically, hypothesis formation in Novamente is done via evolutionary
<br>
methods that are extremely easily and effectively parallelized.  On the 
<br>
other hand, for purposes of attention allocation and assignment of credit,
<br>
it's more effective to have centralized information-integration and
<br>
modeling (though parallelization is possible there is a moderately high
<br>
cost involved).
<br>
<p>IMO assigment of credit is a good example of an AI problem that no one
<br>
has figured out how to parallelize effectively yet.  Traditional AI
<br>
approaches to assignment of credit such as Q-learning, Holland's 
<br>
classifiers, or Baum's Hayek are elegantly parallel in nature, yet
<br>
highly ineffective.  In Novamente we have opted for a more centralized
<br>
and probabilistic solution, which I believe will prove much more
<br>
effective, though this aspect of the Novamente design remains mainly
<br>
unexplored in practice so far (our current work with Novamente requires
<br>
only very simple assignment of credit).  I don't know of any efficient
<br>
parallel algorithm for doing credit assignment in the context of 
<br>
adaptive learning of complex behaviors in a complex environment.  The
<br>
probabilistic approach we are using in Novamente contains some aspects
<br>
that are not all that easily parallelized, although I'm sure good
<br>
approaches to parallelization would present themselves if we had the
<br>
hardware demanding us to come up with such approaches...
