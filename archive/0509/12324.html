Hi Jeff,
<br>
<p>First,  a META comment: I'm not sure that this discussion of the philosophy
<br>
and algebra of uncertain inference is really within the purview of the SL4
<br>
list, is it?  It's a bit of a digression, though it is indirectly relevant
<br>
as it's pertinent to the foundations of AI engineering and rational
<br>
thinking...
<br>
<p>Having said that, I will now continue to make my point until one of the
<br>
powers that be requests me to stop ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ben replied:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Suppose you have a population of 10 birds of different colors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and no other knowledge about the population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; If you sample one of the birds and find that it's a purple goose,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; why does this count as information that all the RAVENS in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; population are black?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because it is evidence that [all non-black objects are non-ravens]. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we know at least one raven exists, and sampling a non-black object
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produces a non-raven on each of N sampling events, then with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasing N comes increasing certainty that no non-black object is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raven.
</em><br>
<p>I agree so far...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And [no non-black object is a raven] is, of course, logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and conceptually equivalent to [all ravens are black], given the tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extra assumption I left out earlier that at least one raven exists.
</em><br>
<p>This is the controversial part.
<br>
<p>To get from
<br>
<p>NOT(black) ==&gt; NOT(raven)
<br>
<p>to
<br>
<p>raven ==&gt; black
<br>
<p>requires a logical transformation that does not preserve &quot;amount of
<br>
evidence&quot;, at least not according to PTL's theory of evidence.  And when you
<br>
look at the algebra of evidence transformation that comes along with this
<br>
transformation, you find that in fact the amount of evidence about
<br>
raven==&gt;black ensuing from NOT(black) ==&gt; NOT(raven) comes out to zero...
<br>
<p><p>The key here is that in PTL &quot;amount of evidence&quot; is tabulated separately
<br>
from probability and comes with its own parallel inference rules.
<br>
<p>The probability of NOT(black) ==&gt; NOT(raven) should be calculated as
<br>
<p>P1 =
<br>
<p>P( NOT(black) AND NOT(raven) )
<br>
------------------------------
<br>
P(NOT(black))
<br>
<p>with total evidence
<br>
<p>N1 =total # of non-black things observed
<br>
<p>and positive evidence
<br>
<p>N1+ = total # of non-black non-ravens observed
<br>
<p>[I say &quot;observed&quot; because for the moment I'm only talking about direct
<br>
evaluation of truth values, not about inference.  These numbers may be
<br>
modified via speculative inferences of course.]
<br>
<p>whereas the probability of raven ==&gt; black should be calculated as
<br>
<p>P2 =
<br>
<p>P(raven AND black)
<br>
__________________
<br>
P(raven)
<br>
<p>with total evidence
<br>
<p>N2 = total # of ravens observed
<br>
<p>and positive evidence
<br>
<p>N2+ = total # of black ravens observed
<br>
<p>(note that these &quot;evidence counts&quot; are not probabilities.  They may be
<br>
scaled into probabilities of course, via dividing by the size of the assumed
<br>
universe or as we call it in PTL, the assumed context)
<br>
<p>Now, ignoring issues related to universal quantification for the sake of
<br>
making a simple point, what you're doing in your Bayesian perspective
<br>
basically reasoning such as
<br>
<p>P2=
<br>
P(black|raven) =
<br>
1 - P( NOT(black) | raven ) =
<br>
1 - P(raven| NOT(black)) P(NOT(black)) / P(raven) =
<br>
1 - [1- P(NOT(raven)| NOT(black))] P(NOT(black)) / P(raven) =
<br>
1 - [1- P1] P(NOT(black)) / P(raven)
<br>
<p>hence using P2 to derive P1.
<br>
<p>However, the problem is that Bayes rule (used to obtain the fourth line
<br>
above from the third) does not preserve &quot;amount of evidence&quot; in the way that
<br>
you seem to be assuming.
<br>
<p>Evidence about P(A|B) in general does not count as evidence about P(B|A).
<br>
One can derive an estimate of the probability of any one of these from an
<br>
estimate of the probability of the other.  But the amount of evidence on
<br>
which this estimate is based needs to be separately calculated, and may
<br>
sometimes be zero.
<br>
<p>In PTL, the evidence about P(A|B) is N_B, the number of B's observed by the
<br>
intelligent system in question
<br>
<p>The evidence about P(B|A) is N_A, the number of A's observed...
<br>
<p>While we can say
<br>
<p>P(B|A) = P(A|B) P(B) / P(A)    [Bayes rule]
<br>
<p>the corresponding rule for evidence amounts is
<br>
<p>N_A = N_B P(A|B)
<br>
<p>which in this case means e.g.
<br>
<p>N_raven = N_(non-black) P(raven|non-black)
<br>
<p>So if we've observed 499 non-black entities and none of them are ravens
<br>
(they're all purple geese, or orange orgasmotrons, or whatever), then we
<br>
have
<br>
<p>N_(non-black) = 499
<br>
<p>and
<br>
<p>P(raven|non-black) = 0
<br>
<p>thus an inferred
<br>
<p>N_raven = 0
<br>
<p>So, the amount of evidence about P(non-black|raven) [or P(black|raven)]
<br>
obtained from P(non-raven|black) is zero.
<br>
<p>Elegant, huh?  Hempel's paradox disappears when you move to two-component
<br>
truth values and tabulate evidence separately from probability.  It doesn't
<br>
just quasi-disappear like in standard Bayesian semantics, it *really*
<br>
disappears.
<br>
<p>[Note: I derived the idea of two-component truth values from Pei Wang's NARS
<br>
framework, but NARS is nonprobabilistic.  PTL is unique in its integration
<br>
of this sort of two-component truth value with probability theory.  However,
<br>
Walley's interval theory of probabilities also uses two component truth
<br>
values of a different sort, and I'm not sure how the Hempel paradox comes
<br>
out in Walley's theory.  Potentially, it could give the same sort of result
<br>
as PTL, which in Walley's terms would correspond to an interval truth value
<br>
spanning the whole interval [0,1], thus being completely uninformative.  I
<br>
mention Walley's approach mostly because it's more &quot;mainstream&quot; than PTL,
<br>
although it's less comprehensive as an approach to inference for AI.]
