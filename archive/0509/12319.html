Eli wrote: &quot;Your statement is certainly not logically correct.  I can
<br>
easily generate situations in which observing a non-black non-raven
<br>
can generate evidence favoring the hypothesis &quot;All ravens are black&quot;
<br>
over its alternatives.  For example, the set of objects includes 7
<br>
ravens and 1 non-raven.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ben replied, &quot;Yes, an observation of a non-black raven TOGETHER WITH
<br>
SPECIAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE SITUATION can yield evidence toward the
<br>
hypothesis that all
<br>
ravens are black.
<br>
But in the absence of explicitly stated special assumptions, an observation
<br>
of a non-black non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis
<br>
that all ravens are black.&quot;
<br>
<p>The only assumption required is that our sample space is finite.
<br>
Interestingly, this assumption is also required if sampling a raven
<br>
and finding it to be black is to count as evidence for [all ravens are
<br>
black].
<br>
<p>We can modify Eli's earlier example to demonstrate:
<br>
<p>Given a set of M ravens and N non-ravens, we randomly sample a raven
<br>
and find that it is black. As the number of times we repeat this
<br>
increases, it becomes asymptotically certain that all ravens are
<br>
black, as compared to the hypothesis that a positive non-zero integer
<br>
number of ravens are non-black. Taking the limit as the number of
<br>
ravens goes to infinity, the evidence provided by sampling a raven and
<br>
finding it is black for [all ravens are black] approaches zero.
<br>
<p>Considering you don't take this as a proper criticism of my
<br>
informal/colloquial assertion that [observing a black raven should be
<br>
evidence for the claim that all ravens are black], it cannot be
<br>
deployed in defense of your claim that [observing a non-black
<br>
non-raven should provide NO evidence toward the hypothesis that all
<br>
ravens are black]. It does provide evidence, and it should. Hempel's
<br>
ravens peck no holes in Bayesian philosophy of science.
<br>
<p>Hempel's paradox is not a paradox at all; it was a confusion based on
<br>
a lack of knowledge on the part of humans. The evidential situation
<br>
proposed was counterintuitive, yes. But that's just yet another reason
<br>
for researchers to stop letting their intuitions overrule the math (or
<br>
science, as the case may be).
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
