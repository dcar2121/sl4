</em><br>
<p>That reminds me.  Could anybody comment on &quot;The Origin of
<br>
Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot; by
<br>
Julian Jaynes?  Its basic proposition is that humans became
<br>
conscious only in the last 2 or 3 thousand years,
<br>
and religion was started by people hearing
<br>
&quot;voices in their head&quot; as they gained
<br>
consciousness, or before these different voices were
<br>
integrated into one conscious mind, or something like that.
<br>
<p>Sounds utterly nutty.  But the book has been famous
<br>
for decades, and I read a couple of chapters,
<br>
and there were a lot of interesting and insightful
<br>
observations, none of which I can recall at this moment.
<br>
<p>I don't believe I will become convinced of its main
<br>
thesis, but perhaps there's enough interesting ideas
<br>
in the book to read it.  Has anyone here read it?
<br>

<br>
<p>PS - My use of &quot;here&quot; to refer to an association that
<br>
has no spatial component is an example of why it isn't
<br>
meaningful to speak of a &quot;Bayesian approach to AI&quot;.
<br>
The hard problems of AI, like resolving that &quot;here&quot;,
<br>
have nothing to do with Bayesian inference.  Carrying
<br>
out Bayesian decision-making is trivial, compared to
<br>
the far less trivial process of producing the
<br>
set of possibilities and their probabilities.
<br>
But that's a subject for a different post.
