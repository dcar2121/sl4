I found Robert Steele's review of TSIN and his article referenced at the 
<br>
review's end to be very illuminating to the fundamental problem underlying 
<br>
research of singularity tech, public understanding and perhaps even the 
<br>
economics connecting the two: we need better interaction. In terms of software 
<br>
engineering this means better interaction between interior components, in 
<br>
terms of research this means better discourse between collegues, but in the 
<br>
larger sphere this means better interactivity between human beings and the 
<br>
technology we depend on. If information technology were both truly democratic 
<br>
and tailored to the needs of people on an individual basis this could 
<br>
facilitate the power of individuals to &quot;think their way to prosperity&quot;, as 
<br>
Steele puts it. It seems reasonable to conjecture that better interactivity 
<br>
means better quality of life, more solidarity and stronger economic 
<br>
performance, which means the garden variety existential risks like nuclear war 
<br>
become marginalized while funding for Seed AI projects becomes more accesible.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can we do as individuals to promote this nessecary shift in human 
<br>
affairs? Consider that Yudkowsky's FAI guidelines are largely concerned with 
<br>
the interaction between a Seed AI's structural components as well as the 
<br>
principles of interaction between a Seed AI programmer and a fledgling AGI. 
<br>
The Foresight Institute's guidlines for MTN research are concerned almost 
<br>
entirely with how the respective parties of government, researchers and 
<br>
corporations should interact to ensure no one party exceeds their bounds and 
<br>
instigates disaster. The promise of Novamente's design is largely in its 
<br>
underlying premise of teaching and nurturing an AGI through external 
<br>
(programmer) and internal (simulated exercise) interactions. I think the first 
<br>
step is to consider our various interests and endeavors in terms of who and 
<br>
how we interact in progress to our respective goals. I think a next step would 
<br>
be to consider the transformative value of an AI project which isn't intented 
<br>
immediately seize the grail of superintelligence, but which is designed to 
<br>
provide individuals with the information they need to act sensibly and in the 
<br>
best interests of the entire techno/species collective. Imagine the cliche of 
<br>
a Global Brain but without the loss of heterogenaity or the pressure to 
<br>
interface in any sort of bio-invasive manner.
