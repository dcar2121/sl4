<p>That is astonishing.  Everything - but everything - you say above 
<br>
applies to your own attitude to ideas you do not like.  When confronted 
<br>
with evidence of a problem that originated in the Complex Systems 
<br>
domain, you (a) claimed that it was incoherent (it was not:  many people 
<br>
other than you found it coherent and correct), (b) claimed it wasn't 
<br>
evidence (it was, by standards that many other scientists live with on a 
<br>
daily basis), then when you were faced with repeated demonstrations that 
<br>
you were not even comprehending the argument, you (c) attacked the field 
<br>
of Complex Systems as unworthy of study and (d) attacked the person 
<br>
delivering the argument as being clearly incompetent.
<br>
<p>Your analysis of the problems faced by human scientists trying to do 
<br>
good science in spite of their own egos is quite accurate, in some 
<br>
respects.  What is shameful is the way you blatantly fail to apply the 
<br>
analysis to your own behavior while at the same time being insufferably 
<br>
condescending towards others.
