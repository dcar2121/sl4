</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Duuuuhhh...
</em><br>
<p>That was one mistake, yes.
<br>
<p>Marcello caught the first one, but his algebra may have been hard for 
<br>
some to follow, so I now explain it intuitively.
<br>
<p>1)
<br>
<p>A mathematician tells you that he has two children.  You ask, &quot;Is one of 
<br>
your children a boy?&quot; and the mathematician answers &quot;Yes.&quot;  What is the 
<br>
probability that the other child is a girl?  Two-thirds.  Why?  Because 
<br>
the possible birth orders are BB, BG, GB, and GG, each equally probable. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first three the mathematician certainly answers &quot;Yes&quot; to your 
<br>
question, and for the fourth the mathematician certainly answers &quot;No&quot;. 
<br>
So since the likelihoods are equal for the first three probabilities, 
<br>
the mathematician's answer doesn't change your prior belief that the 
<br>
mathematician is twice as likely to have a girl and a boy as to have two 
<br>
boys.
<br>
<p>But suppose that you randomly sample a child, and the child is a boy. 
<br>
It is now equally likely that the other child is a boy, or that the 
<br>
child is a girl, because BB is twice as likely to produce a boy in a 
<br>
random sample as BG or GB.
<br>
<p>Still another way of looking at it is that you have incorrectly 
<br>
decomposed your uncertainty into atomic possible worlds.  Atomic 
<br>
possible worlds must slice reality as finely as possible, so an atomic 
<br>
possible world includes, as background state, the values of 'random' 
<br>
variables.  &quot;One white raven and one white nonraven&quot; is not an atomic 
<br>
possible world, but a set of possible worlds, because it fails to 
<br>
specify the value of an important random variable.  An *atomic* possible 
<br>
world, relative to your problem space, is &quot;One white raven and one white 
<br>
nonraven exist, and 'random' sampling will produce a white raven&quot;.  By 
<br>
the definition of random sampling, this possibility contains half the 
<br>
probability mass within the set of possible worlds &quot;One white raven and 
<br>
one white nonraven.&quot;  This atomic possible world is ruled out if random 
<br>
sampling of a white object produces a nonraven, and the probability mass 
<br>
collectively within the set &quot;One white raven and one white nonraven&quot; 
<br>
decreases accordingly.
<br>
<p>2)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;If the midget gives you a nonblack entity when asked, that means the bag must be in states 1, 2, 3 or 4.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The bag must be in states 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.
<br>
<p>3)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;So if the ratio is unchanged via the observation of a white nonraven, i.e. if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P_prior(black|raven) / P_prior(white|raven) =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P(black|raven &amp; I have chosen a random white entity and found it to be a nonraven) /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P(white|raven &amp; I have chosen a random white entity and found it to be a nonraven)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as we see from the fact that b_2/b_4 = a_2/a_4)&quot;
</em><br>
<p>??  This doesn't follow at all.  Previously, you would have to calculate 
<br>
your prior probability that a randomly sampled raven would be black or 
<br>
white by taking into account the probability mass in every one of your 
<br>
(sets of) possible worlds 1 through 7.  You cannot calculate your prior 
<br>
probability using worlds 2 and 4 alone.
<br>
<p>4)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;So there is no Hempel paradox in this case.  Here we are able to observe evidence increasing our estimate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P(non-raven|non-black)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without affecting our estimate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P(black|raven)&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Hempel's Paradox arises because the statements &quot;All ravens are black&quot; 
<br>
and &quot;All non-black objects are not ravens&quot; are logically equivalent, 
<br>
under the standard mathematical interpretation where &quot;All ravens are 
<br>
black&quot; is vacuously true if no ravens exist.
<br>
<p>However, it is not the case that p(black|raven) is always locked to 
<br>
p(~raven|~black).  Although you failed to construct such an example, it 
<br>
can be done.  For example, suppose there are ten objects: a black raven, 
<br>
a white raven, and eight nonblack nonravens.  Here p(black|raven) = 1/2 
<br>
and p(~raven|~black) = 8/9.  Now suppose a different set of ten objects: 
<br>
two black ravens, two white ravens, and six nonblack nonravens. 
<br>
p(black|raven) = 1/2, but p(~raven|~black) = 6/8 = 3/4.  Suppose I am 
<br>
not sure which of these two (sets of) possible worlds I am in, and I 
<br>
randomly sample a nonblack object and it is a nonraven.  This is 
<br>
evidence that I occupy the first world, so (after renormalization) 
<br>
probability mass shifts from the second (set of) possible worlds to the 
<br>
first.
<br>
<p>So sampling a random nonblack object which turns out to be a nonraven, 
<br>
increases p(~raven|~black) but leaves p(black|raven) constant, because, 
<br>
*unlike* the statements &quot;All ravens are black&quot; and &quot;All non-black 
<br>
objects are not ravens&quot;, the two conditional probabilities are not 
<br>
logically equivalent, nor do they always change in lockstep.
<br>
<p>At the start of your problem, you left the bounds of Hempel's 
<br>
confirmation paradox entirely.
<br>
<p>5)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;To see why we have increased our estimate of P(non-raven|non-black), we need to look at the three other possible states of the universe, ignored above:&quot;
</em><br>
<p>?? Why did you ignore them?
<br>
<p>6)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;P(black|raven)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is unchanged via the process of observing a random white entity and finding it to be a raven.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I think you mean &quot;non-raven&quot;, but anyway...
<br>
<p>In several of your possible cases, there are no nonblack objects.  In 
<br>
this case the statement &quot;All non-black objects are not ravens&quot; is 
<br>
vacuously true.  But the conditional probability p(~raven|~black) is 
<br>
undefined in standard Bayes, involving a literal division by zero - 
<br>
after which anything can happen, as in the classic proof that 1=2.  So 
<br>
if you are trying to see what happens to p(~raven|~black), you had 
<br>
better specify that at least one nonblack object exists.
<br>
<p>Actually, I also need to specify that at least one nonblack object is 
<br>
known to exist in every possible world; along with the requirement that, 
<br>
in at least one possible world containing nonblack ravens, the ratio of 
<br>
these nonblack ravens to all other nonblack objects does not approach 
<br>
zero; and the requirement that the proposition &quot;All ravens are black&quot; 
<br>
not initially have prior probability equal to zero; in order for my 
<br>
general conclusion to hold that randomly sampling a nonblack object and 
<br>
finding it to be a nonraven ALWAYS increases the probability assigned to 
<br>
the proposition &quot;All ravens are black.&quot;  (Assuming I haven't missed any 
<br>
other necessary assumptions.)
<br>
<p>If we allow for some possible worlds to contain no nonblack objects, 
<br>
then the procedure of randomly sampling a nonblack object has a third 
<br>
possibility besides &quot;Raven&quot; and &quot;Non-Raven&quot; which is &quot;Empty&quot;.  We then 
<br>
have to take into account the likelihoods assigned to this third 
<br>
possibility, which changes everything.  For example, states 1 and 5 
<br>
assign probability 1 to the result &quot;Empty&quot;.  If we assigned most of our 
<br>
prior probability mass to state 1 or state 5, then the sample coming up 
<br>
with a nonblack object at all, instead of &quot;Empty&quot;, could drastically 
<br>
decrease the total probability assigned to p(black|raven).
<br>
<p>7)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;There are seven distinguishable states for the interior of the bag, each of which one may assign a certain prior probability.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>But which prior probability?
<br>
<p>As seen above, the prior probabilities assigned to states 1-7, may 
<br>
drastically change the effect of sampling a nonblack object and finding 
<br>
it to be a nonraven.
<br>
<p>One of the major benefits of training in probability theory a la Jaynes 
<br>
is that you learn to stop sweeping critically necessary assumptions 
<br>
under the carpet of &quot;no information&quot;.  If you have no information, sir, 
<br>
do please tell us exactly what information you do not have.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wouldn't every say something like &quot;probability theory is wrong&quot; -- it's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branch of math and is correct assuming its axiom systems, just like any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other branch of math....  It's even a *very useful* branch of math which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why Novamente is substantially based upon it....
