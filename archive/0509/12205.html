Michael Wilson and some few others on the seedaiwannabees list were
<br>
discussing AI design, and I wanted to continue the discussion,
<br>
including the wider readership of SL4.
<br>
<p>The thread was started by Chris Paget who also appeared here not too
<br>
long ago, but the point was interested is below:
<br>
<p>Michael Wilson wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Single theorist, yes, in that I don't think the problem is solvable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without standing on the shoulders of giants /and/ paying close
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; attention to the past failures of geniuses and fools alike. However
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I am skeptical about the real value of a large implementation team.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; A software engineer I respected once said to me; 'really innovative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; software is almost always the product of a single mad genius', and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; he had a point. AGI is very difficult to understand, extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; difficult to explain and just doesn't modularise well such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people only need to understand the external interface of bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they're not working on. I have some experience of trying to design
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; an AGI collaboratively and it just doesn't work for nontrivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; designs, at least not now when the field is in its infancy. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yes, I have a reasonable amount of experience in commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; software engineering, leading and following.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I would not be surprised at all if the first AGI is effectively the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; product of 'one mad genius' architect, though that architect may
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have a team of implementers following their instructions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; designing non-core support systems.
</em><br>
<p>I would very much disagree with this point, and increasingly so as I
<br>
continue my studies of both AI, and other complex endeavors.
<br>
<p>Alan Kay is credited with the phrase, &quot;The best way to predict the
<br>
future is to invent it.&quot; and it is a popular concept, particularly
<br>
among the ambitious. Here in the transhumanist and singularitarian
<br>
community, it's a central one. If we are to steer the world away from
<br>
nasty places and situations, we must create the future, right?. We
<br>
even seem to have the biggest lever around, ultratechnologies, AI in
<br>
this case.
<br>
<p>Particularly in America, the concept of single revolutionaries and
<br>
their power to define through invention, influence, and idea, is very
<br>
common(MW is in the UK, but I'm being memetic here)
<br>
<p>But it is, insofar as I'm aware, a theory without any evidence. I
<br>
can't think of any one person who can seriously be credited not only
<br>
with innovative theories, but a complex final design of a nontrivial
<br>
part of our world. Things are much too complicated for that.
<br>
<p>Especially software design, wherein the interactions (even inside a
<br>
system that could be said to be designed by one person) are often
<br>
entirely unexpected to the designer.
<br>
<p>I suppose it just seems very unrealistic to imagine that all the
<br>
relevant complexity could be solved, designed, communicated to drones
<br>
or done personally, all by one person in any kind of reasonable
<br>
time-scale, if it were possible at all. AI in particular is not just
<br>
an architectural and theoretical problem, but many many
<br>
implementation, engineering, and &quot;mere&quot; software design issues.
<br>
<p>To load examples a bit, I could hold up Google, ostensibly a simple
<br>
innovative idea by two graduate students. But upon closer inspection,
<br>
the actual reality of google is the interaction of much more than
<br>
that. Sergey and Larry did not design the cluster architecture it runs
<br>
on, nor the Google File System which contains their database, nor the
<br>
MapReduce implementation that underlies their fast response time.
<br>
<p>It's true that they may have seen the *need* for these things, and
<br>
even spec'd them with the creators. But these systems shaped Google's
<br>
destiny in ways the founders did not plan or decide. It was their
<br>
database and cluster architecture which determined their ability to
<br>
maintain what was for a long time the largest page database on the
<br>
net, what allows them to serve so many different kinds of requests
<br>
quickly, to grow a commodity cluster to unreasonable sizes.
<br>
<p>AI is more integrated, more centrally planned, and necessarily more
<br>
interconnected than most software and engineering, but not so far that
<br>
I believe it necessary or possible for a single person to determine
<br>
enough attributes to really be called 'a single mad architect'.
<br>
<p>There are degrees, of course, and I certainly don't believe that an
<br>
entire Business Unit(a la Microsoft), or Research Center (a la PARC)
<br>
is required or advisable. But an undertaking the size of AI must
<br>
include more people doing significant work on what I would call core
<br>
functions. Quite aside from the time aspect, a single person is simply
<br>
too prone to conceptual mistakes and self induced theory blocks. As
<br>
optimistic as I am about mental plasticity, I don't' think any one
<br>
person can really solve all the problems that are theoretically within
<br>
their intelligence and ability. People get stuck, or lack inclination,
<br>
or prefer to focus on more interesting problems, or simply run out of
<br>
innovative ideas.
<br>
<p>AI, like any complex endeavor, will require a culture to support it's
<br>
exploration. How large of one (whether it could be contained in a
<br>
single company, for example) is an interesting question, but quite
<br>
separate from the disproof of the alluring vision of just doing it all
<br>
yourself.
