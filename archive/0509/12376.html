<em>&gt; OK Michael, so now you're going to argue that because I sometimes

</em><br>
<p>Not directly. Of course everyone makes mistakes, large and small, and
<br>
as long as they're caught and corrected it's not a problem. The question
<br>
is one of attitude. Most people react to evidence that they have made a
<br>
mistake by trying to downplay its significence. For scientists and
<br>
engineers this is most often a claim that they just got some trivial 
<br>
implementation detail wrong, and that their basic ideas are sound. This
<br>
isn't surprising; it's instinctual because it saves face and it's
<br>
superficially rational because it preserves the perceived investment of
<br>
time and energy in the 'big ideas'. Generously the person may be so
<br>
passionate about developing/realising their concepts that they don't
<br>
want to get sidetracked by fixing 'implementation bugs'; less generously
<br>
they may be blind to the progressive accumulation of individually minor
<br>
evidence that their theories are broken.
<br>
<p>In AI it is so easy to be subtly and irretrievably wrong, and there are
<br>
so many traps to fall into, I do not believe it is possible to be
<br>
successful without strongly checking this tendency. This is a question
<br>
of attitude, the way in which the problem is approached, not one of any
<br>
specific design choice. Unfortunately I don't think it's likely that
<br>
your project will produce an AGI Ben, not so much because of what little
<br>
I know about your design, but because your research methology does not
<br>
seem to be rigorous enough to consistently cut through the dross and
<br>
misunderstandings in search of the Right Thing. Unfortunately while your
<br>
actual design has changed, this meta-level approach appears to have
<br>
remained constant over the time that you have been publishing your ideas.
<br>
<p>I don't think that constitutes an insult, and I certainly don't take it
<br>
as such when people call my approach hopeless; no one has managed to
<br>
produce an AGI yet, so if that's your standard of competence then no one
<br>
is competent yet. I would think that your past successes in narrow AI
<br>
and publishing record easily establish a high level of competence
<br>
relative to other researchers as a whole, which is certainly more than
<br>
I or Eliezer have done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I could more easily argue that anyone who would design a programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language as misguided as Flare is incompetent to have anything to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with software...!
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer's actual mistake would not be designing a broken language, which
<br>
is something most people who take a class on compiler theory do. The
<br>
actual mistake would be seriously attempting to design a major language
<br>
without having much experience of major application development,
<br>
compiler development or indeed a wide range of existing languages. I
<br>
agree that back in 1999 Eliezer's weighting on raw intelligence versus
<br>
experience was broken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, I don't want this to turn into a flame war in which I waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my time posting a long list of every major conceptual error Eli or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other SIAI people have ever posted on this list.
</em><br>
<p>Please do continue to point out fresh ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There have certainly been plenty, as indicated by the frequency with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which Eli has shifted his perspective on important issues.
</em><br>
<p>No, this is a /good/ thing. Each perspective shift occured when Eliezer
<br>
realised that his model was conceptually flawed, threw it away and went
<br>
in search of another one. It takes courage and self-discipline to do
<br>
that; too many people would just keep trying to patch up their broken
<br>
model and consequently drift quietly into an isolated dead-end. Yes in
<br>
principle it would've been better to start from first principles, build
<br>
carefully and avoid the adoption of such flawed models in the first
<br>
place, but unfortunately humans just don't come equipped to do that out
<br>
of the box.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest we put these &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks aside and move on...
</em><br>
<p>I never intend to attack people, only ideas. Sometimes I misinterpret
<br>
people's ideas, use overly strong wording, or people just get too
<br>
attached to their ideas and take criticism of them personally. If this
<br>
is an instance of the first or second cases, I apologise. However I
<br>
draw your attention to the SL4 FAQ, which states that flamewars are
<br>
fine as long as they are intelligent and on-topic. Personally I'd
<br>
prefer an intelligent flamewar to a paucity of critical analysis.
