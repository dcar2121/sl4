<p>Ben, standard probability theory says no such thing.  You have to 
<br>
provide a number of additional assumptions before probability theory, 
<br>
the logic of science, makes any logical statements about the 
<br>
probabilities involved.  Observe a green lampshade one way, it means one 
<br>
thing, observe it with different prior information, it means something else.

<p><em>&gt; Instead, I made some careless and silly errors, both with the standard

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Ben, did I wish to justify your intuition, I would use the following 
<br>
reasonable-sounding assumptions.
<br>
<p>1)  Random sampling of objects (not random sampling of a non-black object).
<br>
<p>2)  No correlation between your belief in the color mixture of ravens 
<br>
and your belief in the number of ravens.  That is, whether some ravens 
<br>
are non-black does not, so far as you know, have anything to do with the 
<br>
total number of ravens of all colors, nor the proportion of non-ravens 
<br>
to ravens.  (For all you know there might be a correlation, but if so, 
<br>
you have no idea what direction it's in.)  I.e., if you think that half 
<br>
of all ravens are white, this doesn't change your estimation of how many 
<br>
ravens there are in the world.
<br>
<p>3)  The only thing you know about the result is that it was not a raven.
<br>
<p>Now if you observe an object randomly selected from the set of all 
<br>
objects, and you know only that it is not a raven, this says nothing 
<br>
about the color mix of ravens, because your color mix hypothesis classes 
<br>
all assign equal likelihood to your seeing a non-raven (of whatever color).
<br>
<p>But that's not what probability theory says, as such.
<br>
<p>Probability theory just says to further specify your assumptions.
<br>
<p>Probability theory has plenty of room to encompass structure of the sort 
<br>
Russell Wallace refers to, if you know more about the object than that 
<br>
it is not a raven.
<br>
<p>And if you randomly sample a non-black object, and the only thing you 
<br>
know about the result is that the result is not &quot;Raven&quot;, you are 
<br>
essentially stuck with this increasing the probability of the hypothesis 
<br>
&quot;All ravens are black&quot; under any reasonable prior assumptions.  If you 
<br>
sampled a nonblack object and it was a raven, the probability of &quot;All 
<br>
ravens are black&quot; would go (way) down.  So if you get the converse 
<br>
result of nonraven, the probability &quot;All ravens are black&quot; goes up. 
<br>
Unless you are a priori certain that the result will not be a raven 
<br>
because ravens are too rare.  p(A) = p(A|B)p(B) + p(A|~B)p(~B).  If 
<br>
p(A|B) &gt; p(A) then p(A|~B) &lt; p(A) if both probabilities are defined.
