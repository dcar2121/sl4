<p>I am &quot;now&quot; at that stage?  I was referring to 1992.
<br>
<p>I looked at Flare a few years back.  I was not impressed.

<p>You saw others that closely matched my description?  I think not.  At the
<br>
Supercomputing 2001 conference in Denver I gave a talk about this (in the
<br>
Exhibitor Forums, so it was not published) and then later discussed my
<br>
ideas in detail with the head of a government agency that was charged with
<br>
fostering innovation in this arena.  She was in the process of organizing
<br>
an invitation-only workshop on the subject of software development tools
<br>
for large, complex systems, and she reported that the ideas I had proposed
<br>
in my talk were unique.  Nobody else, she said, was coming at the problem
<br>
from the angle I had suggested.
<br>
<p>I did not describe the details in my last post, only the general approach.
<br>
&nbsp;Not enough for you to dismiss it as closely matching anything.
