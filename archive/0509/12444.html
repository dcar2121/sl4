<em>&gt;Why would we want to evangelize for singularity-related memes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do we know whether increase social exposure to these ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would hasten or delay singularity tech?
</em><br>
<p>I have to agree. Widespread dispersal of the singularity meme would be
<br>
denounced by some, feared by most (think Rapture and end times and see
<br>
the statistics for the number of people in the U.S. who think that
<br>
evolution should be REPLACED by creationism in science classes),
<br>
accepted by few, understood by a handful, and actively pursued by a
<br>
number I could probably count to in a matter of minutes. I think that,
<br>
in this particular case, the harm of stirring up the masses in some
<br>
random direction far outweighs the good of attracting the few who would
<br>
most benefit the cause of bringing about a Friendly Singularity. In
<br>
fact, I would be very interested to see a breakout of shock level
<br>
populations by country or region and see how the reactions played out in
<br>
relation to shock level saturation. For instance, I would venture that
<br>
in highly tech-oriented areas of the U.S. (Los Angeles, New York,
<br>
Silicon Valley, etc. . .) the reaction would fall primarily towards the
<br>
acceptance/understanding end of the spectrum, whilst here in rural
<br>
Kentucky, shock panic and mass hysteria would ensue once the general
<br>
populace grasped that the world as they know it is about to change
<br>
drastically which, knowing the general mindset of my neighbors, is the
<br>
ONLY conceivable outcome without a serious re-education campaign. In
<br>
other words, it may be possible to start with today's children and
<br>
prepare a majority of them for the concept of a singularity by the time
<br>
they are 18, but based on the projections that I keep seeing bandied
<br>
about, this may not be complete by the time full blown singularity is
<br>
upon us.
