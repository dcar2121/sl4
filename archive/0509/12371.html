<p>If a theory or researcher can't handle the basic, simplest cases

evidently this is not the case, and attempting to proceed without

rectifying the deficiency will result in the person in question

falling flat on their face, predictably and repeatadly. I did so

myself several times before realising the importance of explicitly

ensuring that the fundamentals of reasoning are present and correct.

<p>Eliezer wasn't criticising your general mathematical ability, which I'm
<br>
sure is excellent. Considered in isolation, probability theory is quite
<br>
simple algebra. However /applying/ probability theory to any real or
<br>
imagined problems is a formalisation/grounding problem, which requires
<br>
specific expertise that isn't strictly maths. It's particularly difficult
<br>
because until you've had a lot of practice your standard (broken) human
<br>
intuitions will fight you and try to induce you to make mistakes in the
<br>
grounding and hence the maths. Beginners have a nasty tendency to jump to
<br>
unsupported conclusions in probability theory, because their intuition
<br>
is telling them (incorrectly) that 'X implies Y' and they translate Y
<br>
into the corresponding equation without checking the derrivation. I
<br>
would hesitate to call you a beginner at applying probability theory,
<br>
but you did make quite a hash of the problem we just discussed; it may
<br>
be that your reluctance to apply rigour to your arguments is causing
<br>
you to shoot yourself in the foot. I didn't used to like rigour either,
<br>
because it slows things down and dampens those wild flights of invention
<br>
and intuition that seem so satisfying, but then I realised that I was
<br>
rationalising mental laziness and that the rigour is essential because
<br>
the mistakes are cumulative. You seem to be complacent with making 'small
<br>
mistakes' here and there because you believe that it's better to
<br>
concentrate on getting the 'big idea' right, but I think that in AGI
<br>
those kind of small mistakes are indicative of reasoning flaws that have
<br>
a /cummulative/ affect on the probability of building something that
<br>
works. Which is to say, it doesn't take many 'small mistakes' before your
<br>
success probability goes to effectively zero. I suppose the point is that
<br>
the philosophical and psychological legacy surrounding AI can make it
<br>
seem like social science or even art, but it turns out that it's actually
<br>
more like physics; AGI demands conceptual and mathematical rigour.
