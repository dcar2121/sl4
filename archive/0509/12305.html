<em>&gt; Ben - It isn't well-known to me.  Can you tell me a reference to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read so I can understand why you're saying this?  My impression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that the average engineer would say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinforcement learning or temporal-differernce learning are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best means of credit assignment, and the average AI researcher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would say the bucket brigade or a truth-maintenance and belief-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revision system are the best means, all of which are parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That systems implementing the bucket brigade aren't intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean that the bucket brigade doesn't work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Phil
</em><br>
<p>Some of the fundamental conceptual flaws with the bucket brigade algorithm
<br>
are well dealt with in Eric Baum's work, see his papers on
<br>
artificial economies of agents at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.whatisthought.com/eric.html#economies">http://www.whatisthought.com/eric.html#economies</a>
<br>
<p>I don't really remember which ideas are contained in which papers,
<br>
but
<br>
<p>&quot;Manifesto for an Evolutionary Economics of Intelligence&quot;
<br>
<p>is probably a good start.
<br>
<p>And also I suppose he mentions this material 
<br>
in &quot;What is Thought?&quot; though
<br>
he doesn't give full technical detail there.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, however, Baum's solutions to the problems he points
<br>
out with the bucket brigade don't really work well either.  They
<br>
do solve problems the bucket brigade can't, as he demonstrates via
<br>
his Blocks World examples, but they fall apart on larger examples
<br>
(perhaps due to lack of scalability and tunability rather than for
<br>
fundamental mathematical reasons ... but even so...).
<br>
<p>One of the Novamente team reimplemented Baum's Hayek system for
<br>
reinforcement learning and replicated some of Baum's results but
<br>
not others, and found the system extremely slow and very sensitive
<br>
to its parameters....
<br>
<p>So far as I know Baum is not putting too much of his energy into
<br>
the ongoing development of Hayek, which would seem to indicate he
<br>
has also recognized its severe limitations, though he hasn't
<br>
explicitly acknowledged them in print.
<br>
