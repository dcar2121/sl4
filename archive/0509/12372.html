Wow!!!   Yes, that is exactly it, Jef!!   That is an extremely keen
<br>
observation of your part, demonstrating a lot of insight to my world-view
<br>
(flawed as it may or may not be ;-)
<br>
<p>My current suspicion is that if one formulates Hempel's Paradox in terms of
<br>
&quot;experience based semantics&quot; rather than &quot;objectivity based semantics&quot; then
<br>
one find there is no paradox, and one finds that observations of nonblack
<br>
nonravens don't count as evidence of black ravens.
<br>
<p>However, I don't have time today to try and make this idea rigorous, so I
<br>
had decided to keep the idea to myself for the moment.  But you sucked it
<br>
out of me ;-)
<br>
<p>The idea would then be that
<br>
<p>-- from an objective perspective, the standard probabilistic formulation of
<br>
the Hempel situation is the best one and the &quot;paradox&quot; (i.e. the
<br>
counterintuitive conclusion) holds
<br>
<p>-- from a subjective perspective, a different formulation of the Hempel
<br>
situation is the best one and the &quot;paradox&quot; (the counterintuitive
<br>
conclusion) does not hold
<br>
<p>However, I didn't yet finish checking over my drafty subjectivist
<br>
formulation of the Hempel situation, and so I'm not going to post anything
<br>
substantive on it now, for fear of posting more silly mistakes.  I'll wait
<br>
till my current bout of overwork finishes up and then check the idea
<br>
carefully and see if it works...
<br>

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben -
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been watching the last few days' discussion and wondering how closely
<br>
this relates to your position that subjective experience is primary relative
<br>
to the &quot;objective&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect both of these positions of yours may have some basis in common.

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one more thing...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started out this whole silly thread by saying that:
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; &gt; If probability theory as standardly deployed states that an
</em><br>
observation
<br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; of a non-black non-raven provides a NON-ZERO amount of evidence
</em><br>
toward
<br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; the hypothesis that all ravens are black, then this shows there is
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; something wrong with probability theory as standardly deployed.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; Of cousre, an approach that yields small errors may still be
</em><br>
valuable
<br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; for practical AI purposes.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; However, what frustrates me about the quote you cite, and your
</em><br>
attitude,
<br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; is that you seem to be denying that probability theory as standardly
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; deployed is conceptually and logically erroneous in this case --
</em><br>
albeit
<br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; the magnitude of its error is generally small.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I admit that in my followup discussions, after making this statement,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I manifestly failed to demonstrate its truth...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I made some careless and silly errors, both with the standard
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formulation of probability theory and with my own PTL formulation.  I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apologize for this -- I'm not usually quite *that* error-prone even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when badly overworked, but what can I say, it happens from time to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time....
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after all that, I *still* hold the same intuition that I had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;originally.  And this is with the probabilistic arguments regarding the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hempel paradox quite fresh in my mind and quite fully understood both
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conceptually and arithmetically.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't doubt the math of probability theory, but I still have a nagging
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intuitive suspicion that the way the math is being applied to this
<br>
situation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not conceptually right.  Furthermore, I still have the same suspicion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that this conceptual wrongness is related to other problematic issues
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with standard AI deployments of probability theory such as Bayes nets.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be traveling for most of the next two weeks, so don't expect any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brilliant insights or stupid errors from me in this regard in the
<br>
immediate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;future -- but I suspect we haven't heard the last of this issue.
