<p>
Greetings, fellow singularitarians.
<br>
<p>I’m known as Ollie, with the surnames Lamb (patrilinear) vel NcLean 
<br>
(matrilinear). I’m known by those handles, or Neomorphy, which derives 
<br>
from the Greek for “new shape”. I’m currently writing a thesis (to 
<br>
become a PhD dissertation) on our perception of time, and how and why we 
<br>
experience it as “moving”. I get money from automotive research, 
<br>
particularly fuel efficiency and emissions.
<br>
<p>My relevant areas of personal interest are: the nature of Consciousness, 
<br>
Time (its nature and our experience of it) and Morality (meta-ethics). 
<br>
Epistemology and philosophy of science are also among my intellectual 
<br>
strong points.
<br>
<p>I have particular interests in the techy areas of iterative geometry and 
<br>
physical substances (eg: nanotubes). I have absolutely no interest in 
<br>
most computer tech issues such as OS, comp-language issues etc.
<br>
<p>My interest in ethics and time have caused me to become an ardent 
<br>
environmentalist. I consider environmentalism to be largely concerned 
<br>
with the distribution of resources between time periods.
<br>
<p>I’m also an amateur musician.
<br>
<p>I’m a hardcore sceptic, so I only use the term “belief” as shorthand, 
<br>
but I hold the following “beliefs” relevant to this forum:
<br>
<p>* Consciousness is not identical to intelligence
<br>
<p>* Consciousness as a characteristic has not only recently been acquired 
<br>
by humanity. Consciousness extends to a number of organisms, not all of 
<br>
whom regularly utilise language.
<br>
<p>* Human consciousness is not at all like software
<br>
<p>* This may be anthropomorphising, but I suspect that Consciousness is 
<br>
much better “serviced” by a high degree of parallelism. Intelligence, 
<br>
however has no such “correlation”.
<br>
<p>* I also don’t believe in materialism/ physicalism. I’m not a dualist 
<br>
(or an idealist, for that matter), but I wouldn’t disagree with certain 
<br>
versions of Platonism.
<br>
<p>I see no need to bug the whole group about any of these, however, I’ll 
<br>
be happy to elaborate if anyone asks.
<br>
<p>===
<br>
<p>As is customary for newbies, a quick rundown of why I’m joining / have 
<br>
recently decided to act towards the singularity: I’ve long believed that 
<br>
persons will end up predominantly non-human (rudis), and that a key to 
<br>
this progression will be the ability of intelligences to design better 
<br>
intelligences. However, early disappointments with the failure of 
<br>
history to live up to the exponential predictions of optimistic 
<br>
futurists led to misgivings about the dramatic take-off of non-human 
<br>
intelligences. However, recent stumblings across FAI developments (esp. 
<br>
the SIAI) convinced me of just important it is to get the singularity 
<br>
right, first time. Though not a programmer, my own investigations into 
<br>
consciousness could be of some relevance. Hence signing up.
<br>
<p>Looking forward to being a helpful (if quiet) part of SL4. Now I’ve got 
<br>
a lot of catch-up reading to do.
<br>
<p>Ollie
