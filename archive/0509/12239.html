<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are many solutions to this problem, but I'm curious which one you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocate...
</em><br>
<p>Like I said, this challenge was meant for Loosemore alone; I don't have 
<br>
enough time to respond if everyone piles on...
<br>
<p>Googling on Hempel + Bayes turns up some standard responses, for example 
<br>
in <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-bayesian/</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Hempel first pointed out that we typically expect the hypothesis that 
<br>
all ravens are black to be confirmed to some degree by the observation 
<br>
of a black raven, but not by the observation of a non-black, non-raven. 
<br>
Let H be the hypothesis that all ravens are black. Let E1 describe the 
<br>
observation of a non-black, non-raven. Let E2 describe the observation 
<br>
of a black raven. Bayesian Confirmation Theory actually holds that both 
<br>
E1 and E2 may provide some confirmation for H. Recall that E1 supports H 
<br>
just in case Pi(E1/H)/Pi(E1) &gt; 1. It is plausible to think that this 
<br>
ratio is ever so slightly greater than one. On the other hand, E2 would 
<br>
seem to provide much greater confirmation to H, because, in this 
<br>
example, it would be expected that Pi(E2/H)/Pi(E2) &gt;&gt; Pi(E1/H)/Pi(E1).&quot;
<br>
<p>A fine answer so far as it goes, though really it is only half the 
<br>
solution.  The two main points to bear in mind are that, first, a 
<br>
hypothesis tells us which experiences to anticipate, not which facts to 
<br>
believe.  Second, evidence never confirms or disconfirms a hypothesis by 
<br>
itself, it only confirms or disconfirms one hypothesis relative to an 
<br>
alternative hypothesis.  So I need to know what the alternative 
<br>
hypothesis is to &quot;All ravens are black&quot;, and I need to know what 
<br>
probability both hypotheses assign to seeing a red lampshade given the 
<br>
local sampling method.  Then I'll tell you whether a red lampshade 
<br>
confirms &quot;All ravens are black&quot; over the alternative hypothesis.
<br>
<p>In the usual scenario, we suppose that objects are sampled randomly from 
<br>
the set of all objects.  &quot;All ravens are black&quot; does not tell us with 
<br>
what probability we ought to observe a raven.  It does not even imply 
<br>
that any ravens exist at all.  The strength of a hypothesis is what it 
<br>
tells us *not* to expect.  &quot;All ravens are black&quot; only excludes a very 
<br>
tiny amount of probability mass, the possibility that we will observe a 
<br>
raven-shaped object whose color is not black.  Since, a priori, the 
<br>
chance of seeing a raven-shaped object was 1/2 to the Kolmogorov 
<br>
complexity of &quot;raven-shaped&quot;, the hypothesis excludes only a tiny realm 
<br>
of possibilities, and therefore only slightly concentrates its force 
<br>
into other possibilities relative to the hypothesis of maximum entropy. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore seeing a red lampshade is only infinitesimal evidence in 
<br>
favor of the hypothesis that all ravens are black, as compared to the 
<br>
null hypothesis.  If, on the other hand, we have already seen at least 
<br>
one raven, then this confirms other hypotheses which assign a 
<br>
substantial probability to seeing more raven-shaped objects.  And when 
<br>
we do see another raven, its color will confirm subclasses of these 
<br>
hypotheses which say &quot;All ravens are black&quot;, over alternative hypotheses 
<br>
that permit ravens to be more colors.
<br>
<p>Since &quot;All ravens are black&quot; and &quot;All ravens are white&quot; exclude around 
<br>
the same amount of probability mass from the maxentropy distribution 
<br>
(thereby concentrating it into other possibilities), seeing a red 
<br>
lampshade does not confirm one hypothesis over the over, and 
<br>
infinitesimally confirms both over the null hypothesis.
<br>
<p>But it really depends on the hypotheses that seem likely a priori, and 
<br>
even more so on the sampling method.  Suppose there are only two highly 
<br>
probable hypotheses under consideration.  The first hypothesis, that in 
<br>
a group all the ravens are black and one-third of the lampshades are 
<br>
red.  The second hypothesis, that in a group not all ravens are black 
<br>
and one-ninth of the lampshades are red.  If the two hypotheses have 
<br>
equal prior odds, seeing a red lampshade randomly sampled from the 
<br>
subgroup of lampshades, makes it three times as probable that all ravens 
<br>
are black as that not all ravens are black.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; In PTL (Novamente's probabilistic inference component) we handle
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this sort of thing via augmenting probability theory with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; other mathematics.
</em><br>
<p>I shall now demonstrate the folly of adulterating Bayes with lesser wares.
<br>
<p>Suppose that I know that, in a certain sample, there is at least one 
<br>
black raven, and at least one blue teapot, and some number of other 
<br>
ravens of unknown color.  I now observe an item from the group that is 
<br>
produced by the following sampling method:  Someone looks over the 
<br>
group, and if there are no non-black ravens, he tosses out a blue 
<br>
teapot.  If there are non-black ravens, he tosses out a black raven. 
<br>
Now observing a black raven definitely shows that not all ravens are black.
<br>
<p>How would Novamente's &quot;augmented&quot; probability theory handle that case, I 
<br>
wonder?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm">http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm</a>:
<br>
<p>&quot;Hempel's paradoxes are a straightforward consequence of the following 
<br>
apparently harmless principles:
<br>
<p>1. the statement (x)(Rx --&gt; Bx) is supported by the statement (Ra &amp; Ba)
<br>
2. if P1 and P2 are logically equivalent statements and O1 confirms P1, 
<br>
then O1 also supports P2.&quot;
<br>
<p>As the above example demonstrates, to a Bayesian, the idea that &quot;All 
<br>
ravens are black&quot; is supported by observing a black raven, is in general 
<br>
false.  Though it may oft be true in the particular that observing a 
<br>
black raven confirms subclasses of hypotheses which hold &quot;All ravens are 
<br>
black&quot; over their alternatives.
