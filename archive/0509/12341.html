Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where the real difficulty arises is how to generate and refine the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elementary symbols that the logical reasoning component works on.  If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other system did that, and was then smoothly integrated with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical part, no problem.  It's the grounding of those symbols that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sticking point.
</em><br>
<p>What's interesting is that, when you formalize logic in the right way,
<br>
then the boundary between logical reasoning and low-level perception/
<br>
action processing becomes rather fuzzy.  
<br>
<p>Symbol grounding can be done (for example) via Hebbian-learning-type 
<br>
and evolutionary-programming-type learning over memories of 
<br>
perceptions and actions -- and these are methods that can be
<br>
tied in very closely with probabilistic reasoning.
<br>
<p>In an AI system, logic and symbol grounding can be bound together more
<br>
tightly than in the human mind, to the benefit of both processes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I feel that the &quot;other&quot; part is going to be massive, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs a lot more thought than it gets. 
</em><br>
<p>IMO, symbol grounding can be carried out via a combination of
<br>
<p>-- Hebbian-type learning (which can be formalized as a species
<br>
of probabilistic reasoning)
<br>
<p>-- Evolutionary learning (which can be carried out via probabilistic
<br>
methods like the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm or its variants,
<br>
and is a rough analogue to Neural Darwinist type learning in the brain)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To put that another way, I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are many AI formalisms that look great on paper but which, when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented, leave all the really important stuff hidden in the mind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the programmer (who invented, preprocessed and then interpreted the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symbols that were fed to the formalism).  This is of course the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounding problem itself:  recognized and appreciated by many, but still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening today.
</em><br>
<p>No argument there...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lastly, you say:  &quot;However, I suggest that in an AGI system, logical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning may exist BOTH as a low-level wired-in subsystem AND as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-level emergent phenomenon, and that these two aspects of logic in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AGI system may be coordinated closely together.&quot;  If it really did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, it would (as I understand it) be quite a surprise (to put it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mildly) ... CAS systems do not as a rule show that kind of weird 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflection, as I said in my earlier posts.  I suppose we could call this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self-similar&quot; behavior (emergence of a copy of the low level mechanisms 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the highest level emergent behavior), and my understanding is that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this has either never been observed or it only happens under peculiar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that such systems do not seem to exist in nature, nor have they
<br>
been engineered yet.
<br>
<p>But that is no reason not to design and build one!
<br>
<p>Complex Adaptive Systems do not as a rule show this kind of phenomenon,
<br>
yet they are also not as a rule superhumanly intelligent ;-)
<br>
