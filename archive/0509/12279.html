<p><p>To the extent it is practical, that is.  Sometimes, just decoupling

artificial dependencies does not buy much.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Distributing serial algorithms so that there is no central

<p><p>The real trick for humans when designing these types of things is realizing

that determinism is an illusion and that absolutes do not reasonably exist.
<br>
It is not so obvious when talking nano- or femto-second latencies, but when
<br>
the communication latencies creep into the high nanosecond or microsecond
<br>
range the lie becomes hard to disguise convincingly on current hardware.  I
<br>
can't remember how many times I've had to explain that you cannot have
<br>
geographically distributed ACID transactions that are highly reliable *and*
<br>
scalable.  But then, I've also had to explain more than once why it is not
<br>
possible to guarantee 10ms RTT latency in a transcontinental fiber network
<br>
to people who should know better.  It is good to see that the education
<br>
system is doing its usual fine job. :-)
<br>
<p>Letting go of the idea of global state, embracing the idea that time is
<br>
local and relative in the transaction graph, and accepting that one can only
<br>
speak of correctness in terms of probability is difficult for computer
<br>
scientists used to thinking in terms of absolutes and strict determinism.
<br>
<p>While it is not too difficult to design a geographically distributed system
<br>
that is genuinely decentralized with a high probability of being in a
<br>
correct (though not synchronous) state at any point in the system, the
<br>
difficult part is defending the system from intentional attacks against the
<br>
inherent weak points of such designs without the system becoming too heavy.
<br>
This latter issue often tilts real implementations toward locality and
<br>
centralization even if the decentralization model is perfectly acceptable in
<br>
a theoretical transaction theory kind of sense.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Conceiving of algorithms that are parallel, asynchronous,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and error-tolerant from the beginning, and have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptually equivalent serial algorithm, is very hard.
</em><br>
<p><p>Heh -- &quot;very hard&quot;.  Understatement of the year...
