</em><br>
<p><p>I don't, but:
<br>
<p>- I've never seen a rigorous specification of the problem from you. Maybe it
<br>
is a secret, since rigorous specification is a big chunk of implementing a
<br>
solution.
<br>
<p>- Even if you did not want to disclose a rigorous specification of the
<br>
problem, you have not provided any rigorous specification of this
<br>
purportedly necessary software tool.
<br>
<p><p>In short, as far as I can tell the only support for your notion that some
<br>
brand new type of software development something or other is required to
<br>
solve AI is nothing more than your intuition.  Intuition is what got us the
<br>
last half century of fabulously successful AI designs, so color me
<br>
unimpressed in the absence of evidence of something interesting or new.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Prior to starting that AI Ph.D. I had worked long and hard on Inmos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transputers (do you know what they were?  massively parallel hardware with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a novel parallel programming language integrated in the chip design), so my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments about the difficulty level were based on real world experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massively parallel systems.
</em><br>
<p><p>Parallel == Serial == Parallel.  It is not special, just complicated, and
<br>
fairly vanilla large systems design knowledge these days.  It is complex,
<br>
but not *that* complex.  I deal with this every day.
<br>
<p>The complexity of software development on such systems is extremely
<br>
dependent on the nature of the algorithm space one is implementing on them.
<br>
The nature of the trade-offs and problems of parallel systems design are
<br>
fairly well characterized and known.  There are enough dimensions to the
<br>
design choices for these things that compilers/languages have a hard time
<br>
implementing them automatically across the entire space of program
<br>
possibilities.  Which is only a problem to the extent that you have to worry
<br>
about those design aspects yourself, in the same way that a lack of garbage
<br>
collection means you have to worry about memory management.  Also a
<br>
trade-off; the automagic implementations of such things invariably suck for
<br>
some application spaces such that you need to disable them and do it
<br>
yourself anyway.
<br>
<p>Programming languages have a hard time specifying parallelism behavior
<br>
because the scope of behaviors is context sensitive and orthogonal to the
<br>
code flow itself.  There is no way to elegantly specify all possible graphs
<br>
and constraints in a simple ASCII syntax, and so assumptions are buried in
<br>
the compiler/interpreter.  Which is why every parallel programming language
<br>
I am aware of that hides the complexity is broken for some type of
<br>
parallelism.  This is probably the major reason parallel languages like
<br>
Erlang are stuck in niches; unless your software only requires the types of
<br>
parallelism supported by the language, the language is basically broken for
<br>
parallelism.  And many real-world software applications are mixed bags of
<br>
parallelism.
<br>
<p><p>But again, this is nothing more than a tool and therefore mostly unimportant
<br>
to the larger problem of AI.  Every type of parallelism needed can be
<br>
implemented in C by a savvy programmer if it is possible at all.  A nuisance
<br>
sure, but not a major roadblock.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers,
<br>
