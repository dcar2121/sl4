</em><br>
<p>Actually, it looks like Fitelson is saying pretty much the same thing I 
<br>
said in my first reply:  Say explicitly your background assumptions 
<br>
about sampling and prior probabilities, because the results will 
<br>
strongly depend on them.  Fitelson also analyzes the dependency on 
<br>
background assumptions in essentially the same way - albeit at greater 
<br>
depth and lesser breadth.
<br>
<p>The main part of Fitelson's paper focuses narrowly on one challenge: 
<br>
weakening the assumptions necessary to show that a non-black non-raven 
<br>
is *much weaker* evidence favoring &quot;All ravens are black&quot; than is a 
<br>
black raven, assuming both evidences are favorable.  I read the paper 
<br>
quickly, but it looks to me like I discussed a wider range of conditions 
<br>
and dependencies in my own, fast, nonrigorous presentation.  That is, 
<br>
the main part of Fitelson's paper is a rigorous, narrow analysis of one 
<br>
of many issues I briefly mentioned.
<br>
<p>Where Fitelson and I discuss similar relations between background 
<br>
assumptions and results, Fitelson's conclusions seem to agree with mine. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I don't see any place where I departed from the practice of good 
<br>
Bayesians in my first reply to your question - I elaborated on the 
<br>
traditional Bayesian analysis along the same lines Fitelson does.  And 
<br>
you did criticize my own reply to you, not only probability theory &quot;as 
<br>
traditionally deployed&quot;.  Ben, I don't think you have a strong grasp on 
<br>
Bayesian probability theory &quot;as traditionally deployed&quot; - at the very 
<br>
least you need more practice applying it to example problems before you 
<br>
develop a decent feel for it.
<br>
<p>I also don't think it's fair to characterize Fitelson's paper as a 
<br>
criticism arguing that &quot;traditional&quot; Bayesian analysis relies on hidden, 
<br>
unacceptable assumptions.  There are many published works on Hempel's 
<br>
paradox by authors trying to work within the Bayesian tradition.  Those 
<br>
that I have seen tend to do a decent job of stating their assumptions, 
<br>
albeit not with the rigor shown by the best Bayesians such as Jaynes. 
<br>
Fitelson is not criticizing those analyses, he is strengthening a 
<br>
certain result by weakening its assumptions.  The part where Fitelson 
<br>
tries to characterize the standard assumption as overly strong, is not 
<br>
so much criticism of traditionally deployed Bayesian probability theory, 
<br>
as Fitelson trying to show that his new result is interesting.
