Michael Wilson:
<br>
<em>&gt; Unfortunately I don't think it's likely that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your project will produce an AGI Ben, not so much because of what little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know about your design, but because your research methology does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be rigorous enough to consistently cut through the dross and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misunderstandings in search of the Right Thing. Unfortunately while your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual design has changed, this meta-level approach appears to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remained constant over the time that you have been publishing your ideas.
</em><br>
<p>Ah... what I see here is an opportunity to turn an annoying conversation
<br>
into a potentially more interesting one!
<br>
<p>What is my research methodology for my AI project, going forward?  I will
<br>
now describe it briefly...
<br>
<p>For the next phase of the Novamente project it is as follows.  We are
<br>
connecting Novamente to a 3D simulation world called AGI-SIM, where it
<br>
controls a little agent that moves around and sees and does stuff.  We have
<br>
then identifies a series of progressively more and more complex tasks for
<br>
Novamente to carry out in this environment, based loosely on Piaget's theory
<br>
of cognitive development.
<br>
<p>So, our methodology for the next phase is simply to try to get Novamente to
<br>
carry out these tasks, one by one, in roughly the order we've articulated
<br>
based on Piaget.
<br>
<p>If we succeed, we should have an &quot;artificial child&quot; of a sort that can
<br>
communicate using complex if not humanlike English and that can solve
<br>
commonsense reasoning problems, posed in the context of its world, on the
<br>
level of an average 10-year-old.
<br>
<p>I believe there is a strong argument that the step from this kind of
<br>
artificial child to a superhuman AI is not as big as the step from right
<br>
here, right now to the artificial child.
<br>
<p>The big error to ward off in this kind of approach is overfitting: one
<br>
doesn't want to make a system that fulfills the exact goals one has laid out
<br>
by somehow &quot;cheating&quot; and being able to do essentially nothing but fulfill
<br>
those goals.  However, I think the risk of that in this case is low because
<br>
the system we're using, Novamente, was designed with much more general aims
<br>
in mind, and the key algorithms in it have already been used in other
<br>
applications such as data mining and rule-based language processing.
<br>
<p>This next-phase methodology may well prove that what we've done in the last
<br>
phase -- build a first working version of the Novamente core, and then
<br>
engineer and partially tune the cognitive modules of the Novamente system --
<br>
is completely inadequate.  It may prove that PTL (probabilistic term logic,
<br>
my own twist on probability theory) sucks and should be replaced by
<br>
something more standard; or, it may suggest that explicit probabilistic
<br>
reasoning is a bad idea for AI and one should instead try neural net type
<br>
approaches that lead to probabilistic reasoning type behavior on an emergent
<br>
level.  It may show that the Novamente algorithms seem basically sensible
<br>
but will need 1000 times more processing power than is feasibly achievable
<br>
right now.
<br>
<p>Or, it may prove that the Novamente design is well-founded, but just needs a
<br>
few tweaks and modifications to pass through the learning stages....
<br>
