<em>&gt; In my work as a software engineer, I've become convinced

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, in normal engineering we know exactly how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different components are supposed to fit together, but
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; methods.
</em><br>
<p><p>Software engineering has the same tools in implementation with its broad
<br>
collection of idioms and algorithms.  There is a very important difference
<br>
between how software designs are implemented and other types of engineering
<br>
are implemented, but you missed the mark.
<br>
<p>All other types of engineering have this concept in implementation called
<br>
&quot;fudge factor&quot;, while software implementation does not.  An engineering
<br>
implementation that functions with no more than a 10% deviation from the
<br>
design expectation is considered essentially perfect.  To make sure that a
<br>
design performs within its envelope, you can &quot;over-engineer&quot; conventional
<br>
engineering designs for an extra margin of safety.
<br>
<p>In software implementation, everything can be and must be flawless in
<br>
implementation or the implementation is broken.  There are aspects of
<br>
software design that are probabilistic, such as transaction models, but even
<br>
those must be reduce the failure rate to the minimum level reasonably
<br>
possible given conventionally designed hardware.  In normal engineering,
<br>
multiple point failures do not cause catastrophic failures and frequently
<br>
degrade gracefully.  In software engineering a single bit-flip error in a
<br>
million lines of code can crash the system.
<br>
<p>Conventional software is axiomatic in construction, while conventional
<br>
engineering is non-axiomatic.  That is why software is brittle and normal
<br>
engineering is robust under adverse circumstances.
