<p>The probability theory that is currently conventional, sometimes called 
<br>
&quot;Bayesian&quot;, got that way for a reason.  There were some very fundamental 
<br>
proofs that you *had to* do it this way in order to be consistent.
<br>
<p>If Novamente has betting odds where it will buy gambles priced under 
<br>
those odds and sell gambles priced above those odds, and those odds 
<br>
disobey the laws of conventional probability theory in their relations 
<br>
to one another, dutch book may be made against Novamente - I can arrange 
<br>
a set of bets which Novamente will individually accept and which lead to 
<br>
a guaranteed loss regardless of the real state of the world. If PTL's 
<br>
two numbers lead it to bracket probabilities by two numbers, as in 
<br>
Dempster-Shafer theory, so that Novamente will buy gambles priced under 
<br>
one number and will sell gambles priced above a higher number, then 
<br>
dutch book may not be made against Novamente so long as every bracket 
<br>
contains the Bayesian value.  Perhaps it is faster to compute 
<br>
probabilities in this way.  (Perhaps not.)  However, I can still arrange 
<br>
a set of gambles which Novamente will refuse and which would be a 
<br>
deductively guaranteed gain, unless all lower and upper brackets 
<br>
coincide with the exact Bayesian price.  That's the cost of saving on 
<br>
computing power, even if your approximation doesn't give absurd answers.
<br>
<p>Then there are all the theorems which prove that reasoning consistent in 
<br>
various ways - such as the final probability (betting odds) being the 
<br>
same, regardless of the order in which the evidence is taken into 
<br>
account - must be Bayesian.  Et cetera.  Et cetera.
<br>
<p>If you haven't read the particular work of Jaynes, &quot;Probability Theory: 
<br>
The Logic of Science&quot;, read it, especially chapters 2 and 15.  Or maybe 
<br>
Jaynes isn't the remedy that's right for you.  But what you *needed* to 
<br>
do was sit bolt upright and say &quot;Wait, something's wrong with my math!&quot; 
<br>
as soon as you thought PTL gave an answer substantially different from 
<br>
the Bayesian one.  This would have saved some time, even if you didn't 
<br>
know whether you'd messed up the Bayesian math, the PTL math, or both. 
<br>
I recently saved Michael Wilson some time by looking at a complex 
<br>
formula he'd derived, which he'd sent back to me to see if there was a 
<br>
more efficient way to do it.  I looked at the formula and said, &quot;This 
<br>
has to be doing *something* wrong,&quot; because Bayesian probability theory 
<br>
said he couldn't compute the end result from his premises.  It turned 
<br>
out he was, literally, dividing by zero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- My issue with probability theory as a foundation for AI has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with its inability to deal with some issues in a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a way that's *consistent* with probability theory, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to require the addition of a lot of structures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamics that are not suggested by probability theory.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that you're regarding Bayesian probability theory as a 
<br>
computational library, a tool for solving problems.  It's not. 
<br>
Probability theory is the underlying mathematics of the thing you're 
<br>
trying to do.  It's how you recognize intuitively when your 
<br>
approximation delivers an absurd result.  If you can compute things out 
<br>
by brute force probability theory, fine; if not, then approximate using 
<br>
a different algorithm - but don't lose sight of the privileged status of 
<br>
probability theory.  Probability theory is not a computer program. 
<br>
Probability theory is not a fast algorithm for AI.  It's your sanity 
<br>
check.  It's your casting-out-nines.  It's how to spot an absurd end 
<br>
result, and go back and check your approximation line by line against 
<br>
the equivalent Bayesian derivation, until you find the line where you 
<br>
divided by zero.  Probability theory tells you the price (in foregone 
<br>
gains) of saving on computing power, and says what your approximation 
<br>
has to do to avoid guaranteed losses.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't have gotten on your case if you'd said, &quot;Novamente 
<br>
approximates the evidence as zero to save on computing power, though the 
<br>
Bayesian probability is infinitesimally positive.&quot;  It's the part where 
<br>
you said Bayesian probability theory was *wrong* where I got out the tar 
<br>
and feathers and started heaping firewood around the stake in the town 
<br>
square.  PTL doesn't pull enough weight, and intuition doesn't pull 
<br>
enough weight, to contradict a theory that's only got three million 
<br>
published proofs of its unique consistency.  That sort of thing makes me 
<br>
think that you don't respect probability theory, bro, and if I let 
<br>
people go around dissing Bayes, soon Bayes won't get no respect.  If you 
<br>
find a case where you think PTL gives a different result from 
<br>
probability theory, and you see nothing alarming about this, but instead 
<br>
conclude offhandedly that probability theory must be wrong, you will end 
<br>
up not noticing when you divide by zero.
