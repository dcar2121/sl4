[Uh oh, you mentioned the C-word :-) ]
<br>
<p>My take on Julian Jaynes is that he, like many other people, was deeply 
<br>
confused about whether he meant 'Consciousness' [The Hard Problem] or 
<br>
'Consciousness' [Whether I am able think about my own thoughts], or ... 
<br>
etc. etc  .... all the way down the line to 'Consciousness' [Gates in 
<br>
the brain stem are either on or off, determining whether or not I am in 
<br>
a coma].
<br>
<p>Then, on top of this confusion, he speculates about how consciousness 
<br>
may have arisen suddenly and had some causal effects on the human 
<br>
thinking mechanism ... and he is equally unclear about what the latter 
<br>
is and how the causal effect could have acted between the two.
<br>
<p>This is roughly equivalent to a lay person trying to talk about a 
<br>
'computer' without distinguishing between the design of a program, a 
<br>
particular copy of the code of a program, the operating system or the 
<br>
electronics.  And then writing a whole book about it.
<br>
<p>Sigh.
<br>
<p>Having said that, I have been jealous of that glorious title for years. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't it just roll off the tongue in a way that makes it seem like 
<br>
it must be a _great_ book?!  Damn his eyes.

<em>&gt; That reminds me.  Could anybody comment on &quot;The Origin of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Julian Jaynes?  Its basic proposition is that humans became

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;voices in their head&quot; as they gained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, or before these different voices were

<em>&gt; integrated into one conscious mind, or something like that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds utterly nutty.  But the book has been famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for decades, and I read a couple of chapters,
</em><br>

<em>&gt; I don't believe I will become convinced of its main

<em>&gt; PS - My use of &quot;here&quot; to refer to an association that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has no spatial component is an example of why it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful to speak of a &quot;Bayesian approach to AI&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The hard problems of AI, like resolving that &quot;here&quot;,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; out Bayesian decision-making is trivial, compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the far less trivial process of producing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of possibilities and their probabilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that's a subject for a different post.
