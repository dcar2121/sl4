<p>Something is seriously broken if you think that probability theory is
<br>
'fabulously complex' compared to nearly any causal explanation, never
<br>
mind one as sophisticated as genetics. On the contrary, probability
<br>
theory is extremely simple; the only reason humans find it hard is
<br>
because it can be highly counter-intuitive. The total process of a
<br>
human applying probability theory /is/ fabulously complex, but this
<br>
need not be true for an AI, as I will detail below;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Real thinking systems, in practice, obviously cope with the task of

</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that you have a clear idea of how advocates of rational
<br>
cognition are proposing that mechanisms be layered. I have often shot
<br>
down armchair critics of AI for confusing the fact that humans implement
<br>
logical inference as a high level, symbolic process (supported by
<br>
grounded concepts and all sorts of complex lower-level mechanisms),
<br>
while AIs may implement logical inference as a low-level mechanism (and
<br>
indeed, all AIs on current hardware are ultimately based on boolean
<br>
logic). I'm not certain, but it looks like you're making the same kind
<br>
of mistake; an AI can support 'irrational'/'fuzzy'/'intuitive' sorts of
<br>
cognition as a layer above a logical substrate, and then possibly even
<br>
another layer of high-level logical inference above that. Your criticism
<br>
would apply if probability theory was being used the way humans use it,
<br>
as a layer above concepts, grounding etc, or the way that GOFAI might
<br>
use it, i.e. on its own without any of the other necessary complexity,
<br>
but it is inapplicable as a criticism of Bayes as the underlying basis
<br>
for cognition. You are correct that rationally based cognition has not
<br>
been shown to be tractable, but I addressed that in an earlier reply.
