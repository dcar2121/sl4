<p>I'm not sure I can reconcile these two opinions. If you think it's
<br>
feasible to use some sort of logical reasoning, (whether rational
<br>
probability analysis or something else,) as part of the basic
<br>
substrate of a generally intelligent system, and given that any
<br>
successful AI project would necessarily result with a system that
<br>
*does* exhibit logical reasoning at a high level, how could you find
<br>
it unlikely that a system would combine both features? I probably
<br>
misunderstand you.
<br>
<p>Oh, and do fractal patterns not emerge in many complex systems? (Curious.)
