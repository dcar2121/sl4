I want to add my voice in support of what Justin and Ben are saying 
<br>
here, and add another thought.
<br>
<p>I was in the middle of my Ph.D. thesis (in AI/Psychology) in 1992 when I 
<br>
finally realised that the systems I wanted to build *could not* be built 
<br>
without incredibly sophisticated tools.  I stopped work and switched 
<br>
careers to become a software engineer for a while, with the aim of 
<br>
finding out just what kind of tools would be needed.
<br>
<p>I am now firmly convinced that not only can one or two people not 
<br>
succeeed in the task of building an AGI, but that a team of N people 
<br>
where N &gt; 0 cannot do it, unless there is a serious revolution in the 
<br>
art of software tool building.
<br>
<p>The revolution I have in mind (and I can hear the groans starting even 
<br>
as I write these words) involves the introduction of serious amounts of 
<br>
&quot;psychology of programming&quot; into the field of tool building.  I use 
<br>
scare quotes around that phrase because I specifically do not mean the 
<br>
kind of psychology of programming that exists at the moment.  Quite 
<br>
simply, the way that programmers (and all others involved) approach the 
<br>
task of building large systems is based on ideas that were appropriate 
<br>
for small single-processor systems, and completely inappropriate for 
<br>
massively parallel systems.  No account I taken of the specific fatcs 
<br>
about the limitations of human minds, and until someone realises that 
<br>
the path to large system building runs through a preliminary period of 
<br>
revolutionary tool building, no progress is going to be made.
<br>
<p>I say all this mindful of the fact that there are some radical projects 
<br>
going on at the moment.  I have looked at these, and from what I see, 
<br>
the teams, though briliant, do not know anything about psychology.  I 
<br>
have no reason to be optimistic about those efforts.

<em>&gt;&gt;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;can't think of any one person who can seriously be credited not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with innovative theories, but a complex final design of a nontrivial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;part of our world. Things are much too complicated for that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Especially software design, wherein the interactions (even inside a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;system that could be said to be designed by one person) are often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;entirely unexpected to the designer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I suppose it just seems very unrealistic to imagine that all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;relevant complexity could be solved, designed, communicated to drones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or done personally, all by one person in any kind of reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;time-scale, if it were possible at all. AI in particular is not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;an architectural and theoretical problem, but many many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;implementation, engineering, and &quot;mere&quot; software design issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree completely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the current state of hardware/software tech, it is not feasible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for one person to put together a seed AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it's not feasible to envision seed AI as cleanly dividing into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;AI layer&quot; and an &quot;implementation layer&quot;, with the maverick genius
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing the former and his drones filling in the latter. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the present time, there needs to be a fair bit of feedback between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these two layers of any wannabe-AGI system, even if they are *reasonably*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well separated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the other hand, this may not be the case in another 15 years, once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware and software have advanced considerably.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what I would say is: If some small team of individuals doesn't create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI in the next 5-20 years, then perhaps some lone maverick will do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20-40 years from now, once technology has developed far enough to support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lone-maverick activities in this area.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason we don't see lone mavericks building significant, large,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real-world systems is that there are a lot of people in the world, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teams generally emerge to do the job before the underlying support tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaches the point to enable individual-maverick activity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;To load examples a bit, I could hold up Google, ostensibly a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;innovative idea by two graduate students. But upon closer inspection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the actual reality of google is the interaction of much more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that. Sergey and Larry did not design the cluster architecture it runs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on, nor the Google File System which contains their database, nor the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;MapReduce implementation that underlies their fast response time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, in 30 years, implementing Google may be a one-man job, because all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these support technologies will be commoditized.  But there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enterprising humans, so many valuable things get done when they're still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the &quot;needs a team to do it&quot; stage, in terms of the availability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying support technologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Quite aside from the time aspect, a single person is simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;too prone to conceptual mistakes and self induced theory blocks. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;optimistic as I am about mental plasticity, I don't' think any one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;person can really solve all the problems that are theoretically within
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;their intelligence and ability. People get stuck, or lack inclination,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;or prefer to focus on more interesting problems, or simply run out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;innovative ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is a far weaker point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While what you say is statistically true, there may always be exceptions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this sort of rule....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am much more in sympathy with your prior comments about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) the sheer mass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of details involved in a large-scale engineering project making use of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immature technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) the difficulty of separating the purely-scientific from engineering-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oriented aspects of a complex engineering project
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
