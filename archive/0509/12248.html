<p>What!!?  I was talking about my thesis.  On this list, I have never 
<br>
introduced any discussion of my thesis system.  You told me, in your 
<br>
original comment, that I never wrote a rigorous specification of the 
<br>
system i was trying construct in my thesis .... a topic that I had never 
<br>
introduced, that you could not possibly have known about, and that was 
<br>
not relevant to the discussion.

<p><p><em>&gt; - Even if you did not want to disclose a rigorous specification of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, as far as I can tell the only support for your notion that some

<em>&gt; last half century of fabulously successful AI designs, so color me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unimpressed in the absence of evidence of something interesting or new.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Prior to starting that AI Ph.D. I had worked long and hard on Inmos
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Transputers (do you know what they were?  massively parallel hardware with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a novel parallel programming language integrated in the chip design), so my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;comments about the difficulty level were based on real world experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;massively parallel systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Parallel == Serial == Parallel.  It is not special, just complicated, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly vanilla large systems design knowledge these days.  It is complex,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not *that* complex.  I deal with this every day.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, spare me!!  I'm sorry, but this is complete BS.  If you deal with 
<br>
massively parallel programming every day, and you think it is no harder 
<br>
than anything else, then you have never seen it in your life.
<br>
<p>Not for a long time have I seen such a ridiculously naive dismissal of 
<br>
the problems of parallel programming.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The complexity of software development on such systems is extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependent on the nature of the algorithm space one is implementing on them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The nature of the trade-offs and problems of parallel systems design are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly well characterized and known.  There are enough dimensions to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design choices for these things that compilers/languages have a hard time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementing them automatically across the entire space of program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities.  Which is only a problem to the extent that you have to worry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about those design aspects yourself, in the same way that a lack of garbage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection means you have to worry about memory management.  Also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade-off; the automagic implementations of such things invariably suck for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some application spaces such that you need to disable them and do it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Programming languages have a hard time specifying parallelism behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the scope of behaviors is context sensitive and orthogonal to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code flow itself.  There is no way to elegantly specify all possible graphs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and constraints in a simple ASCII syntax, and so assumptions are buried in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the compiler/interpreter.  Which is why every parallel programming language
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am aware of that hides the complexity is broken for some type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallelism.  This is probably the major reason parallel languages like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Erlang are stuck in niches; unless your software only requires the types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallelism supported by the language, the language is basically broken for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallelism.  And many real-world software applications are mixed bags of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallelism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But again, this is nothing more than a tool and therefore mostly unimportant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the larger problem of AI.  Every type of parallelism needed can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented in C by a savvy programmer if it is possible at all.  A nuisance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure, but not a major roadblock.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
