To me, this distinction is far from clear, but this must be my fault.
<br>
My main problem is that you mix the conditions imposed on the substrate 
<br>
with that on the
<br>
abstract structure.  I believe that no principial distinction is needed 
<br>
between different
<br>
(but reasonably rich) substrates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A mathematical formalization of the different varieties of self-modification
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be possible, but I'm not going to undertake that project today.  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;next month!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It sounds very exciting, provided it is true...
<br>
<p>Perhaps you found my scepsis on the mathematical formulation arrogant. 
<br>
Let me explain it
<br>
a bit more thuroughly: Let me assume that yuo have two computational 
<br>
system. In order
<br>
to compare them, you will have to investigate the differences between 
<br>
them. There are
<br>
two types of differences:
<br>
<p>A) Is something achiaveable in one system which is not in the other?
<br>
<p>B) Is something more effectively achievable in one system than in the other.
<br>
<p>Normally you can rule out differences of type A), since almost all 
<br>
reasonably complex
<br>
systems are universal Turing machines. That is, almost all substrates 
<br>
are equivalent,
<br>
therefore  the only question is the efficiency overhead compared one to 
<br>
the other.
<br>
<p>In order to discuss the efficiency, you have to select some (class of) 
<br>
tasks and analyze the
<br>
efficiency of performing that particular (class of) task using both of them.
<br>
<p>The first reason of my scepsis is that giving lower bound on the running 
<br>
time of some
<br>
task within some system is a very hard, let us say almost impossible 
<br>
task for most systems
<br>
and most tasks.
<br>
<p>In order to tell the difference between the type 1) , type 2) , type 3) 
<br>
modifications, you have to
<br>
1) Select (and accurately describe!) some relevant tasks.
<br>
2) Create some measures for the efficiency of their implementation.
<br>
3) Show some differency between their efficiency in the different 
<br>
implementations.
<br>
<p>I am not a real expert in complexity theory, but I can tell that it is 
<br>
quite unprobable that you have
<br>
significant results in the above three points without generating so much 
<br>
hype in the complexity
<br>
theorist community that I would not know about it.
<br>
<p>Best regards, Christian
