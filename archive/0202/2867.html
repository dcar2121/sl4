<br>
<p><em>&gt; How to explain the Singularity depends on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; background of the person you are talking to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the simplest level (&quot;man on the street&quot;) I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe it as:
</em><br>
<p><p>Isn't &quot;man on the street&quot; equivalent to SL0? Depends on which street you
<br>
find the man of course. I would think that the fact that anyone decides to
<br>
join this SL4 list is aware of the Shock Level's that Elizier has coined.
<br>
<a href="http://sysopmind.com/sing/shocklevels.html">http://sysopmind.com/sing/shocklevels.html</a>
<br>
<p>We have to use our judgment to determine what Shock Level we're dealing with
<br>
here, and exactly how much shock we want to introduce into the conversation.
<br>
<em>&gt;From the Future Shock Level essay:
</em><br>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
The use of this measure is that it's hard to introduce anyone to an idea
<br>
more than one Shock Level above - and Shock Levels measure what you accept
<br>
calmly, not what you know about.  There are very few SL4s, and I was not one
<br>
of them (too enthusiastic) when I wrote &quot;Staring Into the Singularity&quot; 1.0.
<br>
If somebody is still worried about virtual reality (low end of SL1), you can
<br>
safely try explaining medical immortality (low-end SL2), but not
<br>
nanotechnology (SL3) or uploading (high SL3).  They might believe you, but
<br>
they will be frightened - shocked.
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Since The Singularity is an SL4 category topic, you may want to simply avoid
<br>
talking about it to SL2 and below. Unless you are an extremely good
<br>
communicator and can talk a person through one or two shock levels without
<br>
sounding like a loony to them, I wouldn't even attempt to try and explain.
<br>
<p><p>SL0 Grandma: What's this Singularity stuff you're reading here? Are you
<br>
joining a cult? Lord have mercy! I'm calling the pastor for an intervention
<br>
...
<br>
SL4 Singularitarian: No Gran, don't be silly. It's just some stuff from my
<br>
friends I have that are into science. It's a technical term, stuff to do
<br>
with computers.
<br>
SL0 Grandma: Damn computers, all they do is screw up! You know, in my day
<br>
...
<br>
SL4 Singularitarian: Uh, you know I'm a computer programmer. Take it from me
<br>
they're handy. How else will you email me without one?
<br>
SL0 Grandma: I'm so proud of you, boy. You're so smart being able to help me
<br>
with this new-fangled stuff. I could never do it without you. Come here and
<br>
gimme a kiss ...
<br>
SL4 Singularitarian: Yes Gran. Got any more of those special cookies? I'll
<br>
miss you when you're gone.
<br>
