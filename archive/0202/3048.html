<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>There seem to be a lot of new people on this list lately, so I reckon it's
<br>
an appropriate time to bring up an old topic again.
<br>
<p>My Novamente AI project (successor to the Webmind AI Engine project carried
<br>
out at Webmind Inc.) could use some new team members.  I am not terribly
<br>
optimistic about finding any, but, I reckon it's worth another try.  &quot;Never
<br>
venture, never win&quot; as Sir Edmund Hilary said.
<br>
<p>We are implementing what we believe will, when complete, be a &quot;Real AI&quot;, and
<br>
a seed AI capable of initiating a hard takeoff.  We have a fairly complete
<br>
mathematical design for the system (in the form of a 300-page book
<br>
manuscript, not published), and we have detailed software designs for many
<br>
components.  Right now about 20% or so of the system is implemented.  The
<br>
implementation is in C++ (mostly C) and runs only on the Linux platform at
<br>
the moment (making it more portable won't be a huge task, but we have no
<br>
immediate plans to do so; there are plenty of more urgent matters).  Right
<br>
now it doesn't do a lot of Real-AI-ish things, though it can do some
<br>
interesting kinds of data mining, and there is a lot of valuable
<br>
infrastructure in place.
<br>
<p>The design is strongly inspired by the Webmind AI Engine, but is also
<br>
substantially different in several important ways, including the approach to
<br>
low-level scheduling and memory management, and some high-level issues like
<br>
the way procedural and declarative knowledge are interrelated.
<br>
<p>The Webmind AI Engine was being developed by a team of at maximum 45 people
<br>
(scientists, developers and testers), over a period of 3 years.  Webmind
<br>
Inc. dissolved in early April 2001 for financial reasons.
<br>
<p>The current Novamente team consists of 8 people: two of us here in
<br>
Albuquerque (though I may be moving soon), one in New York, and the rest in
<br>
Brazil.  We are dividing our time between Novamente work aimed at creating
<br>
Real AI, and Novamente work aimed at making practical datamining products
<br>
from the system.  (We are dreamers, but we also need to eat during the
<br>
pre-Singularity period.)
<br>
<p>I understand that &quot;having a complete design for a real AI&quot; is a big claim.
<br>
There are others on this list (e.g. Eliezer, Peter Voss, Shane Legg) who are
<br>
moving in roughly the same direction as we are, and whose thinking I respect
<br>
considerably.  However, I think that the Novamente project is considerably
<br>
further along than their projects are.  Whether we are further along in the
<br>
*right direction* is of course a matter of opinion, until the final success
<br>
or failure of our project is empirically determined.  At present, no one
<br>
outside our project really has the knowledge to assess our design.  Even
<br>
those who were involved with the Webmind AI Engine do not, because we have
<br>
made tremendous conceptual progress in the last year, based on rethinking
<br>
our approach from scratch in the light of the lessons we learned at Webmind
<br>
Inc.
<br>
<p>We currently do not have funding adequate to pay new team members salaries.
<br>
We do anticipate getting funded in the future, and when this happens, people
<br>
who have been working during the unfunded period will be first in line for
<br>
paying positions.
<br>
New team members will be compensated via shares in Novamente LLC, a
<br>
for-profit firm that owns the Novamente codebase (and is not currently
<br>
making any significant profit ;)
<br>
<p>This is not an open-source project.  There are two reasons for this:
<br>
<p>1) We believe our prospects for achieving significant funding again are
<br>
greater if the source is kept proprietary, as business funding sources are
<br>
generally (and often rightly, from a business perspective) nervous about the
<br>
open-source approach.
<br>
<p>2) We believe that managing an open-source project of this nature would
<br>
require a *lot* of time and effort, and we don't have the spare bandwidth
<br>
right now.
<br>
<p>We could quite likely be convinced to open up the project by a sufficient
<br>
infusion of dollars!
<br>
<p>This is not an easy project for a new person to get involved with.  So far,
<br>
during the last year, several have tried, and one person has partly
<br>
succeeded.  The difficulties with getting involved seem to be:
<br>
<p>a) the concepts involved are very difficult, and unfamiliar;
<br>
<p>b) it is hard for anyone to carry on work of this kind on a part-time basis,
<br>
but without pay, few can afford to help out on a full-time basis;
<br>
<p>c) the current team is very tightly-knit, having worked together for 4 years
<br>
already, and we communicate very concisely and efficiently amongst
<br>
ourselves, which means that in spite of our best efforts it can be hard for
<br>
a new person to &quot;break in.&quot;
<br>
<p>Who do we need, at this stage?  There are four categories of individual who
<br>
could be useful to us.
<br>
<p>1) Excellent C/C++ programmers, familiar with the Linux environment or eager
<br>
to learn.  Strong knowledge of data structures and algorithms is required;
<br>
we do many nasty things with trees, hashtables, etc. and our own
<br>
experience-refined variations on the standard data structures.  Knowledge of
<br>
OO design patterns is highly desirable, even though the  majority of the
<br>
codebase is straight C.  The willingness to adhere to a standard coding
<br>
style is important, as is an understanding of when it is and isn't necessary
<br>
to comment a line of code.  Also, the ability to write a comprehensible
<br>
design document describing a complex piece of code (articulate broken
<br>
English is fine; the majority of the team has English as a second language).
<br>
<p>2) We could use another mathematician in the project.  The kinds of math
<br>
involved are, for instance: combinatory logic, nonlinear dynamics, and
<br>
probability theory.  We have a lot of fairly complex mathematical structures
<br>
defined, and there are some moderately thorny technical math problems to do
<br>
with them, which we have deferred considering until they *absolutely have to
<br>
be solved*.  We do have the expertise to handle all this stuff, but we're
<br>
all over-busy (to make an understatement).
<br>
This is not &quot;pure&quot; mathematics however; working on the math problems we have
<br>
requires a good sense for practical software efficiency of algorithms, and
<br>
the ability to combine formal work with simulations and Mathematica-type
<br>
algebra crunching.
<br>
<p>3) We could use someone experienced with programming language
<br>
implementation, particularly in the functional programming domain.  We have
<br>
designed a programming language called Sasha, which needs to be implemented.
<br>
The idea is not to implement Novamente in Sasha (not for a few years at
<br>
least), but to use Sasha to specify complex internal Novamente structures,
<br>
and to represent complex learned internal Novamente structures.
<br>
<p>4) We could use a cognitive science expert with a broad scope of knowledge
<br>
and a sympathy for complex, self-organizing-systems type thinking.  We have
<br>
a very comprehensive design worked out, which synthesizes ideas from
<br>
computer science, experimental and introspective psychology, mathematics,
<br>
neuroscience, and assorted other disciplines.  We could use someone who has
<br>
the time and inclination to absorb this whole design and think about it as a
<br>
whole, and come up with creative criticisms, additions, modifications, etc.
<br>
In order to &quot;get&quot; what we're doing, you'll need to have a decent knowledge
<br>
of computer programming as well as some mathematical knowledge (some of the
<br>
interesting *conceptual* aspects of the design are really only graspable in
<br>
terms of equations, not words), as well as a thorough and diverse knowledge
<br>
of cognitive science.
<br>
<p>Excellent e-mail communication skills are required in all cases, as this is
<br>
a globally distributed team.  We do not have any fancy global knowledge
<br>
management system.  We use CVS and e-mail.
<br>
<p>This kind of work takes a lot of time.  If you have, say, 5 hours a week
<br>
available, you probably can't be useful to us.  On the other hand, 10-15
<br>
hours a week is probably meaningful, assuming you're an efficient worker.
<br>
One thing I've observed is that most people overestimate the amount of free
<br>
time they're willing to devote to a project such as this.  Another thing
<br>
I've observed is that most people can MAKE a substantial amount of time for
<br>
a project such as this if they want to badly enough.
<br>
<p>Anyway, if there's someone on this list who fits into one of the above 4
<br>
categories, and is interested in helping us create real AI over the next few
<br>
years, please e-mail me privately and let me know.  <a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=Re:%20New%20Novamente%20team%20members%20sought...">ben@goertzel.org</a> .
<br>
<p>The Webmind Inc. AI team was too big, I can see in retrospect.  We don't
<br>
need a 45-man squadron.  However, we could use another 5-10 excellent
<br>
people; this could make the difference between it taking us 3-5 years to
<br>
finish implementing and testing the system (with the current team and our
<br>
current division of labor between real AI work and datamining work) and 1-2
<br>
years.
<br>
<p>If you are interested in joining our team but do *not* fit into one of the
<br>
above 4 categories, then I'm certainly open to chatting with you about what
<br>
we're doing, but unfortunately I don't have any concrete work for you at
<br>
present.  The most useful thing you could do for us would be to spend some
<br>
time gaining expertise in one of the 4 areas mentioned above.  I have made
<br>
some efforts to involve people lacking the appropriate skill set in the
<br>
project, with predictable lack of success.  Enthusiasm and brilliance are
<br>
important, but not adequate in themselves for jumping into the middle of a
<br>
project like this one.
<br>
<p>If you are interested and qualified, the way it will work is as follows.
<br>
First, you will have to sign a nondisclosure document to be allowed access
<br>
to the design documentation.  Then we'll give you some stuff to read, which
<br>
realistically will take a couple months, as there is a lot there.  Then we
<br>
will give you a small project to do, to get a sense of your abilities and
<br>
the pragmatics of working with you.  If this initial project is succesful,
<br>
then you'll be accepted as a full member of the team, given CVS access and
<br>
put on our glorious internal e-mail lists, and so forth.  I hope this
<br>
&quot;initiation process&quot; does not sound too arrogant; the purpose of it is
<br>
protect us from spending too much of our time working with intelligent,
<br>
interested people who don't actually possess the combination of time and
<br>
skill required to help with the project.
<br>
<p>Thanks for reading this far!!!
<br>
<p>Yours,
<br>
Ben Goertzel
