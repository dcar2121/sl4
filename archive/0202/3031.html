Of course an algorithm would be very far fetched, but it I think the 
<br>
following much much simpler
<br>
theoretical problems are also out of reach:
<br>
<p>a) Show two self-modificating systems which are provably different. I 
<br>
mean by different that
<br>
one of them can perform some tasks more effectively than the other.
<br>
<p>It seems to be still hopeless, so it would be great if you could:
<br>
<p>b) Give precise mathematical definition of two systems, and some 
<br>
evidence (not proof) that the
<br>
one system is significantly more efficient in some way than the other. 
<br>
(Part of the problem
<br>
is of course to define some efficiency measure which has some slight 
<br>
correspondence with real-word
<br>
efficience. Normally, one considers two algorithms equally efficient if 
<br>
the running time is within a
<br>
constant factor of the running time of the other, and vica versa. This 
<br>
distinction is of course
<br>
too fine for most cases, but sometimes the constants involved are soo 
<br>
huge, that you can't say
<br>
anything about the real time performance.)
<br>
<p>While reading your three different types of self modificating systems, 
<br>
my first thought was:
<br>
are they different at all? Does not allow the first type of self 
<br>
modification the same degree of
<br>
flexibility and the effectiveness for all learning tasks? Of course you 
<br>
are allowed to be 1000000000
<br>
(or whatever) times slower (simulations always have overhead...), but if 
<br>
you never get slower,
<br>
&nbsp;then the two types are not at all distinct from a theoretical point of 
<br>
view.  In this case your
<br>
three cases are not at all different from the mathematical point of 
<br>
view.  To be more concrete:
<br>
does not lead the learning process of type 1) to a higher level learning 
<br>
(i.e. to an improvement
<br>
in the learning process itself), if  your system is large enough? There 
<br>
are good chances that you could
<br>
simulate learning systems of type 2) by sufficiently complicated systems 
<br>
of type 1). Of course
<br>
I can't support this intuition, because you have not even clearly 
<br>
defined the difference between
<br>
type 1) ,2) and 3) systems. Even a precise mathematical definition would 
<br>
be of great value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Indeed, the mathematical formalization I have in mind will involve some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very-hard-to-compute quantities, and hence will be of value only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a) conceptually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I would not neglect the conceptual value. I think you could happily 
<br>
write down your thoughts
<br>
if you had the slightest evidence the the different types of self 
<br>
modifications you proposed are
<br>
basically different.
<br>
<p>Of course I can't blame you. Developing ground breaking theories is 
<br>
hard, the chances of
<br>
success are uncalculable and it costs lot of time. At this stage of the 
<br>
development, the time may
<br>
be better invested in practical (engineering) work.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, having the basic definitions and at least a basic 
<br>
mathematical formulation
<br>
can be of great deal of help in guiding the practical process, and for 
<br>
an effective communication
<br>
on the subject.
<br>
<p>Normally I am quite irritated by people stating that they could  
<br>
formulate something mathematically,
<br>
and use this as an argument. It is nornally used when running out of 
<br>
real arguments.
<br>
<p>I am not against working using mostly intuition, In most of my time, I 
<br>
also work on producing efficient
<br>
but hard to prove solutions for huge problems, so I know the gap between 
<br>
the theoretical
<br>
and practial world, but I also love mathematics, so my first commandment is:
<br>
&nbsp;Do not take the name of Mathematics in vain!
<br>
<p>Best  regards, Christian
