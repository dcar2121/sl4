</em><br>
<p>Yes the &quot;story of Mel&quot; is a classic; but not terrably relevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Everyone knows that Real Programmers write in machine code or assembly, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their code is self modifying and is tightly coupled with the hardware 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maybe the OS.
</em><br>
<p>This idea of &quot;realness&quot; is a macho thing which has no relevance to
<br>
actual computer programming... Its like saying &quot;Real drivers drive
<br>
stick&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Modern programmers use higher-level languages such as C, LISP, etc. and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rely on the compiler to optimize the code. Modern operating systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (including MSDOS?) have a memory manager to protect the code section of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a process from being modified.
</em><br>
<p>DOS will let you get away with anything while also providing services
<br>
for guest-oses as well as reasonably modern software... =)
<br>
<p>If you look at concurrent systems you see that you must eliminate
<br>
self-modifying code because process B might attempt to run code that has
<br>
been incompletely modified by process A. Additionally, modern processors
<br>
cache data so agressively that a tightly self-modifying program will not
<br>
function correctly as the instruction cache is never synchronized with
<br>
the data cache... 
<br>
<p>The obvious way around this is to implement a system that allows the
<br>
program to generate new code at runtime, this is then linked in to the
<br>
program binary by the OS in a safe way... Other high-level concepts,
<br>
such as &quot;functionals&quot; and &quot;macros&quot;, provide ways of generating code on
<br>
an as-needed basis. 
<br>
<p>When a code segment is nolonger needed, it is reclaimed by the OS or
<br>
compiler...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When creating a seed AI, is it still wise to use a component-based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture with an OS that provides memory protection?
</em><br>
<p>Well... the CPU provides memory protection, the OS manages it.
<br>
Alternatively, protection could be provided through the compiler with an
<br>
unprotected CPU, the OS performing the same function...
<br>
<p>If you could show me how component based software is written in LiNuKs,
<br>
I would be glad to evaluate it for you... But as far as I know, you
<br>
can't. 
<br>
<p>Windows seems to be better in a number of ways demonstrating that it is
<br>
not the memory protection but rather how the OS utilizes it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is top-down programming going to give a seed AI any advantage over a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bottom-up implementation?
</em><br>
<p>Please give an example of each....
<br>
Top-Down/Bottom-up generally refer to problem analysis techniques rather
<br>
than what the finished software looks like. 
<br>
<p>If you look at current implementation approaches you will probably
<br>
classify them as bottom-up... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what if we don't understand it, so long as a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do and they don't all die at the same time, why shouldn't we get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the latest PC or supercomputer, start hacking in self-modifying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assembly for the first generation of seed AI?
</em><br>
<p>Not a bad idea!
<br>
If you are referring to the previous calculations of $43mil, we wouldn't
<br>
want to buy that machine even if we could afford it... 
<br>
<p>In a few months I expect AMD CPUs with 333mhz (DDR) Front side busses... 
<br>
We will be able to assemble a development box with that technology for
<br>
around $1000. This would be the best choice for an ameture developer...
<br>
<p>However, it is my beleif that one could make useful progress on AI with
<br>
just paper-and-pencil, and sucessfully demonstrate theories on an
<br>
antiquated 486. 
<br>
<p>My biggest problem is that I don't have an OS that I would consider even
<br>
remotely suitable for work in AI. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not an easy task I know, but we have hardware emulators or virtual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine software to help debug the seed during development.
</em><br>
<p>*shrug*... 
<br>
The hardware isn't the problem, nor is there any evidence that it is... 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I know there are many correlations between self-modifying code and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological DNA programming,
</em><br>
<p>=\
<br>
The DNA builds your brain then mostly shuts down....
<br>
It contains a meta code for intelligence. It doesn't program your mind
<br>
rather it specifies neurological features which behave in desirable
<br>
ways... 
<br>
<p>While an effort to reverse-engineer the brain through DNA may prove
<br>
fruitful and useful, it is still wrong to say that DNA plays an active
<br>
role in your intelligence or that it is self-modifying... Asside from
<br>
mutations replication, your DNA is fixed at birth and only self-modifies
<br>
in a random fassion during meiosis. 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the changes in neural structure that take place througout
<br>
your life should be thought of in terms of training and adaptation
<br>
rather than self-modification which implies a higher level of
<br>
direction...
