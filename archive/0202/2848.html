<p><em>&gt; Sometimes, though, I'm put in situations where I

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?&quot; question that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to answer.  Does anyone have good suggestions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on how to do this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>How to explain the Singularity depends on the 
<br>
background of the person you are talking to.
<br>
<p>At the simplest level (&quot;man on the street&quot;) I 
<br>
describe it as:
<br>
<p>Throughout mankind's history, technology has been
<br>
accelerating.  Better technology has allowed 
<br>
populations to grow.  More people have more brains
<br>
to invent new things faster.  Even today, most
<br>
of the world is still uneducated.  As more countries
<br>
get developed, the number of educated people will
<br>
continue to increase, even though population
<br>
growth is starting to slow down. So technology
<br>
will probably continue to accelerate in the near
<br>
term.  In the longer term, one of several things
<br>
can happen:
<br>
<p>(1) We will hit limits set by the laws of the
<br>
universe, at which point technology will settle
<br>
down.  Examples: wireless communications already
<br>
happens at the speed of light, and the strongest
<br>
possible material (carbon nanotubes) has been
<br>
discovered.
<br>
<p>(2) We will discover ways around the current laws
<br>
of the universe, and technology will continue to
<br>
accelerate to infinity.
<br>
<p>In either case, there will be a time of fastest
<br>
technology gowth.  In case (1) it will be just
<br>
before you slam into the universal limits, in
<br>
case (2) it's when you accelerate off to infinite
<br>
technology.  The time of fastest growth happens
<br>
once in human history, so it is a singular event,
<br>
hence the name 'Singularity'.
<br>
<p>Various projections made by researchers place the
<br>
likely time of the Singularity sometime in the first
<br>
half of the 21st century.  Because the level of 
<br>
technology will be so much higher than we have now,
<br>
it will be as hard for us to imagine what it will
<br>
be like as for a cave man to imagine New York City.
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>Note the above description doesn't include any
<br>
mention of AI.  That's because AI is only one area
<br>
that can go exponential.  Factory automation is
<br>
starting to provide massive productivity gains
<br>
in many fields.  When you get to the point that
<br>
factories can build copies of themselves, in theory
<br>
the cost of all types of 'stuff' will start behave
<br>
the way computers do now.  If your listener can
<br>
understand your initial explanation, then you can
<br>
go on to add the effects of computers:
<br>
<p>Computers are among the fastest growing technologies.
<br>
For what you would spend on one researcher 24 hours
<br>
a day, 365 days a year (i.e. 5 people) today you
<br>
can buy enough computers to do 6 trillion calculations
<br>
per second.  This is about 1/500th of what a human
<br>
brain performs.  Computers double in performance 
<br>
every 15 months or so.  Nine doublings, or about 11
<br>
years, will bring the computers even with the
<br>
humans.  So human researchers will have twice the
<br>
brains to work with (their own plus the computer).
<br>
So the pace of research should acclerate even more.
<br>
The next generations of computers will come faster
<br>
and faster, because the computers will have 2, 4, 8,
<br>
16, . . . times as much capability as a human.
<br>
This is just like the pace of technology advancing
<br>
faster now, when there are 6 billion people around,
<br>
than in the stone age, when there were only 6 million.
<br>
More brains... faster progress.
<br>
<p>Once you get to the point where computers greatly add
<br>
to the human brains, it will only take a few years
<br>
until you get to the limits of the universe or your
<br>
technology goes to infinity.  If computers themselves
<br>
don't hit a limit in improvement in the next 15 years,
<br>
we will get to that 'Singularity' time.
