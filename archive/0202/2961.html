<p>Well, Eliezer was the only one to get the &quot;treatment&quot; because his was the
<br>
only name to appear more than once in the main body of the text.  NYT usage
<br>
only applies Mr. on second and subsequent uses.
<br>
(Gordon Worley appears a second time, but only in the suggested readings
<br>
section, where I used first and last names for all.)
<br>
<p>Deferential?  Sure!  That FAQ is intended as a charter document for the
<br>
Church of the Singularity (Reformed), with &quot;Mr.&quot; Yudkowsky as our noble
<br>
founder, a la L. Ron Hubbard. . .  Just kidding, of course, although I
<br>
wouldn't mind the tax exempt status.
<br>
<p>I suppose it would be easy enough to drop all the Misters.  For some reason,
<br>
repeatedly referring to people by just one name has always seemed to me like
<br>
something best saved for athletes, musicians, and dead thinkers.  (Of
<br>
course, Mr. Yudkowsky would need to be martyred at some point to give a
<br>
Church of the Singularity any kind of credibility... )
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know, I know, it's an incredibly trivial point. But people will be
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>As an aspiring young writer I am flattered by your confidence, your Baron
<br>
Lord Esquireness.
