</em><br>
<em>&gt; At the very least, if you want to say that the Sysop does not have an

anthropomorphic power-corrupts
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Don't worry!  The Sysop is totally immune to the tendency to be corrupted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by power!&quot;  This does not reassure people.
</em><br>
<p><p>Maybe we disagree on what the purpose of an FAQ should be.  If my FAQ was
<br>
supposed to be taken as an attempt to convince everyone that a Sysop is a
<br>
wonderful idea, I have failed miserably.
<br>
<p>My goal was to have the reader go away thinking, &quot;When all is said and done,
<br>
the Sysop Scenario is just an interesting thought experiment.  But I do see
<br>
that there could be some pretty great things on the horizon.  Now I wonder
<br>
what the future is *really* going to be like. . .&quot;
<br>
<p>My goal was not thave the reader go away thinking, &quot;Eliezer and the
<br>
Singularitarians think they know exactly what is best for humanity and are
<br>
building a supercomputer that will force their opinion on everyone and
<br>
everything.&quot;  Unless every effort is made to dispel this myth, this will be
<br>
the default opinion of most people who catch wind of the Sysop Scenario.
<br>
(Please reassure me that this is not a myth!)
<br>
<p>I agree that it wouldn't hurt to beef up some of the answers by providing
<br>
more metaphors and links.  I intend to do this.  But I think it would be a
<br>
mistake to project the idea that CFAI proves a Sysop to be the very
<br>
embodiment of Friendliness.  I didn't think this was your position;  If it
<br>
is, I confess to having missed the whole point of CFAI.
