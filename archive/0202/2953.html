<em>&gt;&gt; I assume some will still be around to upload, and not necessarily to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; same Sysop you decide to visit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A &quot;Sysop&quot; is universal within human space [...]
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I've thought about this for the past week, and I'm no closer to liking it or
<br>
thinking it's a good idea.  I had a rambling reply, but I realized most of my
<br>
points were based on several assumptions, so I decided to just state them in
<br>
case they are easily dispelled. Except for the two+ minds thing (the resource
<br>
limits), I feel that these assumptions, along with Murphy's Law, will survive
<br>
into and through a singularity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- Unsolvable problems aside, even with near-infinite intelligence not
<br>
everything will be deduced ahead of time.  There will still be a lot of
<br>
exploring of the state-space of technology and its implementation.
<br>
&nbsp;- For some problems, two+ minds working together produce better/cleaner/
<br>
faster/more solutions than the two+ minds working alone. (This is based on my
<br>
assumption that at any one moment there is an upper limit on the number of
<br>
resources that can be constructively committed to a single mind.)
<br>
&nbsp;- Many problems can be solved quicker with directed experimentation, or even
<br>
exhaustive testing, than with the pure application of intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;- You can't always tell which problems are which ahead of time.
<br>
&nbsp;- Without 100% knowledge of the universe, there will be problems that can't be
<br>
solved, or even predicted through simulation.
<br>
&nbsp;- For any given intelligence level, there are good plans that will just fail,
<br>
for reasons you could not have foreseen.
<br>
&nbsp;- We might explore the wrong paths, and commit to things that fail.
<br>
&nbsp;- Some experiments and tests might be unpredictably disastrous or fatal.
<br>
&nbsp;- Sometimes action is required, whether a correct solution or knowledge is on
<br>
hand or not.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Arona Ndiaye&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; In the OpenSource world, securing a box or software is not that impossible.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;- Look at the latest CERT alert for SNMP, it's hit many many vendors, and
<br>
there are some heavy consequences possible.  According to one vendor, everyone
<br>
was vulnerable because they all integrated some common (open) code from one of
<br>
the earliest SNMP implementations. (No, I don't think an SI would fall for
<br>
this.  Even human intelligence shouldn't have.  Use it as a model of finding a
<br>
flaw in your foundations.) But:
<br>
&nbsp;- In general when I look at open source, I see a bunch of peers coming
<br>
together on their own, openly sharing ideas, with no strict (rigid) hierarchy
<br>
of control or management.  Experience and knowledge show and are usually
<br>
respected.  Peer review is important.  If you or your friends don't like
<br>
something or the direction things are going, you're free to go off and
<br>
implement your own ideas, toss them up, and see if they stand on their own.  If
<br>
it's better, people might adopt it.  Multiple ideas are active at once,
<br>
competing with each other.  You usually get more ideas out of the group than
<br>
you put in.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;With all of this in mind, the Sysop and singleton-AI look fragile.  A
<br>
commitment of everything to a single solution, where one failure could lead to
<br>
a total loss.
<br>
<p>From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; Incidentally, a Sysop is not universal &quot;by definition&quot; but because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descends from, or was constructed by, a singleton superintelligence with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local competitors [...]
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;For the reasons above I don't think that a Friendly AI would arrive at the
<br>
singleton Sysop scenario outlined in the FAQ and Eliezer's write up.  I'll
<br>
admit one ready exception - the Sysop could turn out to be the lesser of
<br>
several evils, at a time when &quot;action is required, whether a correct solution
<br>
or knowledge is on hand or not.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the FAQ:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In order to do its job the Sysop would probably have to be the most powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity in Sysop Space
</em><br>
....[on to a different topic]....
<br>
<em>&gt; unless its understanding of Friendliness were considerably different than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general ethical consensus of today
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Would the sysop be more powerful than any two entities combined? Any billion?
<br>
All of them?  Independent of the subject, if 95% of the Sysop's constituents
<br>
said &quot;Sysop, we think you and the other 5% are wrong&quot; would the Sysop back
<br>
down?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Egan never did quite explain why no polis ever made war on any other
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;If I were the author trying to retrofit an excuse, I would say that the same
<br>
failings that caused the people to turn inward and start ignoring the outer
<br>
universe also had the side effect of ending war-like conflicts.  They didn't
<br>
really care enough.  It took a person newly created by the sysop to break them
<br>
out of their inward spiral.
