The author of the article clearly has little idea what he is 
<br>
talking about.  So far, .NET has not made significant inroads 
<br>
into corporate computing.  J2EE has become a grab-bag of 
<br>
techniques with it central component pieces (EJB) quite painful 
<br>
to do real projects in.  Neither the JVM or the .NET equivalent 
<br>
are that powerful.  Both seriously constrain what can be done in 
<br>
languages built on top of them or compiling/translating down to 
<br>
them.  Constraints that have some good points from the point of 
<br>
view of safety, especially with &quot;average&quot; programmers, are also 
<br>
constraints that prevent doing some very elegant and useful 
<br>
things at all or without a lot of kludges or becoming 
<br>
significantly more productive and producing software more 
<br>
well-tuned and maintainable than what is generally produced today.
<br>
<p>I was not at all happy to see .Net does not support free 
<br>
functions, or mutiple inheritance, or run-time typing (directly) 
<br>
or other models of program execution than convential C-Java 
<br>
stack models or ...
<br>
<p>In short it casts into stone a lot of common current 
<br>
mass-prejudice that is far from any real software wisdom.
<br>
.
<br>
<p>As long as the software world runs on hype it will never begin 
<br>
to improve, much less begin to improve at anywhere near the rate 
<br>
of hardware. The world needs a new software panacea, a new 
<br>
software coporate bandwagon, like it needs a hole in the head.
<br>
<p>Object oriented technology is a great thing.  I've been deeply 
<br>
into it since the days when the only people that showed up for 
<br>
conferences were a bunch of university people and assorted 
<br>
long-haired visionaries.  BUT OO is not the best methodology for 
<br>
all types of software problems.  Both .Net and Java act as if it 
<br>
is.  This is a fundamental and unnecessary flaw.

<p><p>If the real language is seriously limited in some critical ways

<p><p>The idea of underlying base language and set of conventions to

time.  It is not something new.  There have been various

attempts that failed in the market in various ways.  Java has 
<br>
gotten farther than most (some 100 language implementations more 
<br>
or less have been made to rest on the the JVM). I salute 
<br>
actually having two of these base languages that are publicly 
<br>
acknowledged.  But unfortunately, both dumb down what can be 
<br>
done (and how naturally it can be done) in languages that sit on 
<br>
top of them quite significantly.  Both also limit the kind of 
<br>
tools than can be made to work directly at the base level by 
<br>
virtue of their designs.
