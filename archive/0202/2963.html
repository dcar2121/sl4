<p>
&nbsp;In retrospect, I could have replaced most of my last posting with
<br>
&quot;intelligence will always be fallible.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This is based on my assumption that at any one moment there is an upper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; limit on the number of resources that can be constructively committed to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; single mind.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is a mind?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't know.  How about: you can distinguish multiple minds from a single
<br>
mind because multiple minds can arrive at different conclusions regarding the
<br>
topics I posted earlier, and because different minds know different things.  A
<br>
single mind will have a single conclusion or no conclusion, but not several
<br>
disagreeing conclusions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ...a Sysop composed of differentiated and specialized [X], each self aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and continuously engaging in intense information exchange with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop-ian [X]
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I replaced a word with X, an unknown variable. If you set X to &quot;people posting
<br>
to a mailing list&quot; then you might be describing SL4.  Other values would
<br>
describe the US federal government, or a corporate structure, or the pieces of
<br>
my brain working together.  The Sysop I see in (read into?) the FAQ is one of
<br>
the more tightly coupled examples.  It reaches single conclusions on subjects,
<br>
and acts uniformly on those conclusions.  Not a problem if it has peers that
<br>
are allowed to arrive at other conclusions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a googlebyte-size Sysop, I find it hard to believe that ve would only have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one mind... so, a more likely outcome, in my opinion, would be a Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; composed of differentiated and specialized subprograms, each self aware and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuously engaging in intense information exchange with other Sysop-ian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subprograms and perhaps even a main brain.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I think a more likely scenario is autonomous agents working locally and
<br>
independently, to achieve some global effect. Like an ambulance and fire-truck
<br>
on every corner. This setup would not be able to solve some global problems
<br>
that span localities.  It does soothe some of my monkey-brain fears.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if we don't think SI's will get ontotechology, then there must be a mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit to how dense/large a computing/emulation centre is.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm thinking about knowledge propagation across a distance and time to
<br>
convergence, and the inability to know everything (that's going on), since you
<br>
can't be everywhere.  I don't see how onto-technology would change the fact
<br>
that your mind and mine are located in different places.
<br>
&nbsp;Maybe there won't be any size limits if it turns out that all actions a mind
<br>
has to respond to happen at speeds significantly less than thinking speeds and
<br>
knowledge propagation speeds.
