<p>Well, at least the situation is symmetrical.

<p><em>&gt; And I feel like there's nowhere else to go with

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.
</em><br>
<p>When I find myself in a situation like that, I generally try to break down
<br>
what is being argued into smaller pieces which are easier to clarify, or
<br>
argue about if that's what's necessary.  Breaking down a hard takeoff into
<br>
specific epochs, for example.  But as one breaks the discussion into smaller
<br>
pieces, it becomes harder and harder to construct a mathematical model,
<br>
because mathematical models are not computer models; an equation has a hard
<br>
time capturing if-then branches, discontinuous functions, self-reference,
<br>
complex systems with functionally distinct parts.  I can imagine developing
<br>
a computer model of a hard takeoff and then playing with the assumptions to
<br>
see which emergent behaviors tended to be robust across a wide range of
<br>
models.
<br>
<p>To put it another way, if &quot;intelligence&quot; is a single quantity, then you may
<br>
be able to try and model a hard takeoff in terms of y' = f(y).  But as soon
<br>
as you realize that computational subsystems sum to cognitive talents and
<br>
cognitive talents combine with domain expertise to yield domain competencies
<br>
and that domain competencies in programming then turn around to modify
<br>
computational subsystems; and that the programmers and the AI are
<br>
co-modifying the system; you then have to build the computer model first,
<br>
and see what behaviors it exhibits, and *then* try to describe those
<br>
behaviors with simpler equations - if you can find any.
<br>
<p>I've also been sorely tempted of late to build a computer model.  But I'd
<br>
build the model without trying to make it mathematically elegant.  I'd toss
<br>
in things such as functions that were linear in one place, exponential in
<br>
another place, then logarithmic for a stretch.  Why?  Because that's what
<br>
real life is likely to be like.  Behaviors that don't survive that kind of
<br>
noise are probably not strongly emergent enough to have a chance of telling
<br>
us something about the real world.
<br>
<p>I don't trust simple models of hard takeoffs.
<br>
<p>But, you can always read the debate between Max More and Ray Kurzweil on
<br>
kurzweilai.net if you're interested; Kurzweil mentions some discussion with
<br>
Moravec about formal models of hard takeoffs.  Though I think Moravec is
<br>
just using y' = f(y).
