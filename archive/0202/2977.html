_Transcension_ by Damien Broderick
<br>
(Science fiction novel, currently available in hardcover.)
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765303698/singinst">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0765303698/singinst</a>
<br>
<p>NON-SPOILER REVIEW:
<br>
<p>Okay, I'm not an unbiased reviewer:  The novel quotes one of my Extropians
<br>
posts as a section epigraph and has a small plug at the end for the
<br>
Singularity Institute.  Nonetheless, &quot;Transcension&quot; is good old-fashioned
<br>
entertaining SF, and comes as close to taking a poke at the Singularity as any
<br>
SF is likely to manage.
<br>
<p>&quot;Transcension&quot; goes on the bookshelf of that odd and distinct genre of
<br>
&quot;explicitly Singularity-aware science fiction&quot;.  On the metaphorical left end
<br>
of this shelf is apparently Singularity-aware SF that nonetheless manages to
<br>
somehow dance around the Singularity:  &quot;Excession&quot; by Iain M. Banks, &quot;War in
<br>
Heaven&quot; by David Zindell, &quot;Heaven's Reach&quot; by David Brin, &quot;Mother of Storms&quot;
<br>
by John Barnes.  On the right end of this shelf are the reigning monarchs, &quot;A
<br>
Fire Upon the Deep&quot; by Vernor Vinge and &quot;Permutation City&quot; by Greg Egan.  I
<br>
would basically rate &quot;Transcension&quot; as about two-thirds of the way toward the
<br>
right.  I hope that Damien Broderick goes on to write more Singularity
<br>
literature and knock Greg Egan off his perch to become the new Lord of Future
<br>
Shock (a planetwide post which in nonetheless always held by an Australian). 
<br>
But if not, &quot;Transcension&quot; is probably still as good as Singularity-aware SF
<br>
is likely to get, right up to the moment of the actual Singularity.
<br>
<p>Don't let my basic inability to deliver unmixed compliments get in the way of
<br>
the fact that this is a darned good book.  Other reviewers give five-star
<br>
reviews with flying neon banners, but no, I have to measure everything in
<br>
fractions of &quot;Permutation City&quot;.  Just remember that 0.67 PC is a heck of a
<br>
high rating.
<br>
<p>Amazon.com says that this is a 2-3 day book and that UPS shipping will take
<br>
3-7 days, but I ordered it on Wednesday and it was there on Thursday.  It
<br>
actually arrived before I got the email saying that it had shipped.  (And yes,
<br>
I checked, and this really was the specific book I had ordered and not a
<br>
coincidental gift from someone else.)  How things do accelerate, these days. 
<br>
I mention it because I think it's pretty funny, considering the book's subject
<br>
matter.
<br>
<p><p><p>SEMI-SPOILER MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
<br>
(caution: do not read if you are spoiler-allergic)
<br>
<p><p><p>Here's a statement that will come as absolutely no surprise to anyone who's
<br>
read this book:  I have issues with Aleph.  In fact, the first time I
<br>
encountered this entity, I said something along the lines of &quot;No, no, no, no,
<br>
no!&quot;, accompanied by repeatedly banging the palm of my hand against my
<br>
forehead.  Followed by:  &quot;Who is this 'Aleph' character?  None of my work,
<br>
I'll tell you that.&quot;  But hang on until the end of the novel.  It does get
<br>
better, although certain earlier events are never adequately explained.
<br>
<p>I also worry that, although the book is easily comprehensible to we jaded
<br>
transhumanist folk, it may leave substantial other sectors of the planet
<br>
totally confused.  The truth is, I have absolutely no idea how the average SF
<br>
fan is likely to react, or whether current SF critics are emitting rave
<br>
reviews or complete incomprehension.  But this audience, at least, should be
<br>
able to track the novel easily enough.
<br>
<p>I'd like to thank Damien for putting my epigraph in a novel where it sounds
<br>
wise rather than silly, and would also like to praise him for his totally
<br>
accurate one-line description of the Singularity Institute.
<br>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this novel is also more aware of certain advanced concepts
<br>
than any other Singularity literature.  There are certain points in the book
<br>
where you can hear the SL4 mailing list talking (though not necessarily me).
<br>
<p>If your model of the Singularity is such that today's humans end up making
<br>
individual decisions about whether to become transhuman, and you don't want to
<br>
fall in love with someone you'll have to leave behind, then buy a copy of
<br>
&quot;Transcension&quot; and loan it to the prospective loved one in question.  Of
<br>
course this may not be the best book to use as an *introduction* to the
<br>
Singularity, but once the basic concepts are there, it's a good way to raise
<br>
the issue.
<br>
<p>It should also be fun to loan this book to someone and then casually say,
<br>
&quot;Gee, don't you think it's odd that there's been so little progress in AI for
<br>
the last fifty years?&quot;
