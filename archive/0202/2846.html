</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;The consumption of power in convincing a human being to upload would be

</em><br>
<em>&gt;there*, and more ethical too.  So both the SI and we win.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
As Alan has already pointed out: you misunderstood my point: I meant the 
<br>
computational resources
<br>
used for simulating the human being. Good quality simulation is a costly 
<br>
thing... Even if you have
<br>
large amount of resources, you (the AI) will try to use them as 
<br>
efficient you can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&lt;&lt;Most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people let themselves convinced by people on the same level rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by more intelligent ones, let alone by machines. And even if a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;superintelligent AI would find very effective (but semantic wrong) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for uploading by analysing the human memetic flora and the flaws of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human thinking, would it be &quot;ethical&quot;to convince them that way?&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;~shock level deficency detected~
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This SI &quot;machine&quot;, as you put it, would be very, very far from our current 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conception from what a machine is.  This &quot;machine&quot; would be much more like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;God&quot; (not in the Christian sense) than any &quot;machine&quot; seen up to this point.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For example, it could take on the appearance of your long lost father or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lover, or give you a feeling of complete bliss when in its &quot;presence&quot;.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those are very anthropocentric examples.  A true SI would be &quot;more human than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human&quot;, in the godliest sense we can comphrehend.  Super empathic, super 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethical, super nice, just an all around great guy to be around!  =D   Is it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;ethical&quot; to bring in a starving homeless child from off the street and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clothe them and educate them, even if they are afraid of social interaction 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation (In case you couldn't guess.  It seems someone missed my earlier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analogy about human love being a fleck of gold and the Singularity being a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;block of gold the size of a house, amazingly.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you wish to continue arguing this point further then please mail me 
</em><br>

It will turn out in this century whether it was a &quot;shock level 
<br>
deficiency&quot; or the opposite of it.
<br>
I find the human-centric view-point most of you propose is basically 
<br>
flawed. The remark
<br>
&quot;let alone by machines&quot; was not intended to express my view-point or 
<br>
opinion but of those
<br>
people who are to be convinced (probably on a very low shock level, 
<br>
whatever SL means. :) ).
<br>
However, the mail was meant to be quite sarcastic, unfortunately, you 
<br>
have taken it too literally...
<br>
<p>To make my point more clear: would you care about convincing your pets 
<br>
to upload? First of
<br>
all, it does not make too much sense to upload a cat,  secondly, if you 
<br>
want to upload it, you will
<br>
simply do it and not convince it. But let's go further: if you uploaded 
<br>
your cat to do an interesting
<br>
experiment, would you start to upload all cats?
<br>
<p>I don't want these questions to be answered, because the real questions 
<br>
will be much much
<br>
more complicated and far from being so binary than they seem to be today...
