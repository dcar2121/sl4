<p>
I take a fairly dim view of complaints about hardware, OS's and programming
<br>
languages not being suitable for AI.  Of course there is some validity to
<br>
the complaint, but it's often used as an excuse for lack of AI progress when
<br>
the real problem is lack of conceptual understanding.
<br>
<p>One view is:
<br>
&quot;If you say you  know how to make an AI, put up or shut up.  Write up the
<br>
design in equations.  Write it up in pseudocode.  Write it as a formal
<br>
program specification.  Show us an AI design that looks workable, show us
<br>
why it can't run efficiently on current hardware, OS's and programming
<br>
languages, show us in detail why you think it *would* work on some other
<br>
kind of hardware.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another contrasting view is:
<br>
&quot;No, I don't know exactly how to make an AI, but I have an intuition about
<br>
it, and I could flesh out this intuition into a detailed design IF I had the
<br>
right kind of hardware/OS/programming-language to experiment with.&quot;
<br>
<p>There is no doubt that if I had the right massively parallel hardware to
<br>
use, equipped with a suitable OS &amp; programming language and
<br>
debugging/testing framework, then the process of arriving at the Novamente
<br>
AI design would have been vastly faster.  On the other hand, if I had
<br>
started out the (Webmind, the predecessor to Novamente) project with a fully
<br>
detailed AI design, then I would have been able to figure out pretty well
<br>
from the start how to get it working on the hardware at hand (clusters of
<br>
SMP machines).
<br>
<p>As it is, we started out implementing Webmind by implementing a really
<br>
beautiful distributed agents framework, which was basically an &quot;AI OS&quot;
<br>
running on top of Java, suitable conceptually for implementing and
<br>
experimenting with our AI designs.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, in spite of a lot of clever ideas, we failed to make this AI
<br>
OS adequately efficient.  But experimenting with our AI ideas running on top
<br>
of it helped us to create a detailed mathematical AI design (Novamente).
<br>
Once we arrived at this, we saw how to implement our design on the
<br>
hardware/OS/prog-langs at hand.  Not elegantly but workably.  And that's
<br>
what we're doing now -- since April 2001 -- with a loooong way to go since
<br>
we only have small team and minimal $$ these days.
