Arg!  I can't believe I missed the chat!  I arrived home about 30 minutes 
<br>
after it dissolved, and asked a room full of idle people for a copy of the 
<br>
discussion, and Anand was *right about* to send it to me, then of course my 
<br>
comp freezes.  I come back in 5 minutes and Anand is gone, with the precious 
<br>
data I was fiending for.  So, *does anyone have a log file of chat*?  Please 
<br>
send.

<p>Two interesting URLs; www.sysopmind.com and www.kurzweilai.net.  It should 
<br>
take you a month or two to complete those.  I got a lot of value (and reason 
<br>
to be here, I believe) from those two sites.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose what annoyed people the most was my failure to accept

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From Eliezer's description of the &quot;SL4 Mailing List&quot;; &quot;a place for 
</em><br>
ultratech-savvy friends and enemies of the Singularity to fight it out&quot;.  I'm 
<br>
assuming ultratech-savvy means no spending of valuable time bickering about 
<br>
the feasability and desirability of uploading, for example, regardless of our 
<br>
differences on the issue.  Eliezer, can we get some clarification on what you 
<br>
mean by &quot;ultratech-savvy&quot;?  Which techs are ultra?
<br>
<p>And, a quick question to Singularitarian cryonicists, if any;
<br>
<p>If you believe in imminent existence of superintelligent drextech-wielding 
<br>
plunge-you-into-an-infinite-world-of-fun-and-growth type Sysop, why would you 
<br>
find it helpful or reasonable to freeze yourself upon death?  I find this 
<br>
anthropocentric, because I truely think that an SI could easily revive any 
<br>
human being it chose to, if it were an ethical/productive act, (which I 
<br>
believe it would be) and would not requiring a frozen lump of grey matter to 
<br>
do so, when it could just as easily extrapolate physical law backwards, or 
<br>
retrieve the light waves you gave off, or whatever advanced historianism 
<br>
methods it has.  When the Singularity starts to approach, progress in *every* 
<br>
valuable field will explode upwards radically, perhaps by an order of 
<br>
magnitude every minute or so eventually; this includes the field of 
<br>
historianism, and ethics, of course.  If advances in these two areas merit a 
<br>
Mass Resurrection (which I believe they will) then you won't have to worry 
<br>
about signing up for Alcor or whoever.  The impetus for a mass resurrection 
<br>
is that people will miss their loved ones and wish to have them back.  This 
<br>
brings &quot;ethical closure&quot; to a timeline.  Then, someone like me (or maybe an 
<br>
SI) will wish for *all* the bugs and bees and plants and animals and people 
<br>
THAT EVER LIVED to be revived.  I think the Sysop will not only have the 
<br>
capability but the desire to do this.  In this manner, we achieve &quot;time 
<br>
compression&quot; in which we can access any past era whatsoever whenever.  Cool, 
<br>
huh?
