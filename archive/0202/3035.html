<em>&gt; Normally I am quite irritated by people stating that they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulate something mathematically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and use this as an argument. It is nornally used when running out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real arguments.
</em><br>
<p>Christian, often the reason I turn to mathematical formalization is that I'm
<br>
frustrated with the ambiguity of natural language.  I say something in words
<br>
that, to me, clearly represents my intuition.  Then Eliezer (for instance)
<br>
slightly misinterprets it and rephrases it in a way that's (in my view)
<br>
almost but not quite right.  And I feel like there's nowhere else to go with
<br>
the discussion *except* into the domain of mathematics, because ordinary
<br>
language is not precise enough to make the distinctions that need to be
<br>
made.  Of course, one can do without special symbols, if one wants to
<br>
construct extremely complex sentences that effectively describe mathematical
<br>
structures and use specially defined terms, but that's not really preferable
<br>
to me.
<br>
<p>I was not trying to use a potential mathematical formulation as an argument.
<br>
Rather, it was an excuse for bowing out of an argument temporarily!  I felt
<br>
Eliezer's rephrasing did not fully capture the distinction I was making,
<br>
but, couldn't see how to fully explain my idea in ordinary language...
<br>
<p>The point in question was not a new one to me.  Pei Wang and I have been
<br>
discussing something similar.  He doesn't believe there is an important
<br>
distinction between the different levels of self-modification, and we've
<br>
been going back and forth on this a bit.
<br>
<p>I recently spent some time creating a (pragmatically useless so far)
<br>
mathematical definition of &quot;intelligence&quot;, building on the one I gave in
<br>
1993 in my book The Structure of Intelligence.  It is this that I would
<br>
build upon to formalize the notion of levels of self-modification.  The
<br>
foundation here is algorithmic information theory (which means that one is
<br>
dealing with uncomputable quantities, and quantities that are meaningful
<br>
only for arbitrarily large computer programs, or else relative to some
<br>
specific reference UTM).
<br>
<p>Anyway, all this back-and-forth dialogue is probably going to push me to
<br>
actually write up the formalization in question, at some point in the next
<br>
month or so.  Unless, as sometimes happens, the idea dissolves along the
<br>
path from my unconscious mind to the language of mathematics ;-D
