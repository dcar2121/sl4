<em>&gt; Mr. Yudkowsky asserts that it is possible to create software without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of the kinds of flaws exploited by hackers.  The truth today is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this level of security is difficult to produce, and even more difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to verify in the perpetual cat-and-mouse game between human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers and human hackers.
</em><br>
<p>Greetings to each and everyone and Happy Valentine's (early or late for some
<br>
of you but hey...)
<br>
<p><p>I couldn't miss that one.... aaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh !!!!!
<br>

<p>The kinds of flaws exploited by hackers ( y4 w3 0wn v - we rule, hum !!... I
<br>
mean hum... they rule ..)are **stupid** flaws which are design flaws in the
<br>
first place. In the OpenSource world, securing a box or software is not that
<br>
impossible. It just takes discipline, keeping aware of current issues and
<br>
constinuously improving security via patches, updates, redesigning (by hand)
<br>
parts of the OS and/or software. I doubt that a Superintelligence would
<br>
leave similar design flaws. Just because Microsoft sucks at Security and
<br>
leave all options by default as : &quot; Please, come in, would you like a cup of
<br>
tea maybe ?&quot; does not mean that security is an unnatainable goal. Most
<br>
computer users are absolute idiots who take a computer as a perfectly
<br>
working thing, like a car. The computer industry is barely 50 years old, it
<br>
still needs to mature. Reaching that maturity might take very little time
<br>
compared to let's say the automobile industry but it still needs to mature.
<br>
A lot of people have very little security problems and that is **regardless
<br>
of the OS being used**. I would say that 90% of security issues are **user
<br>
issues*, whereby the user has got no clue about an OS, computing practices,
<br>
very little (computing) common sense, general lack of knowledge about
<br>
computing in general. What do you expect ? My dad's a Psychologist and he
<br>
kicks ass in his discipline but he's utterly clueless when it comes to
<br>
programmming the video or anything realted to technology or computers...(or
<br>
was, not anymore) !!! Certain persons just **block** in front of the
<br>
computer, they go in *auto* mode where they stop thinking and just pray for
<br>
miracles. People need to learn an discover the tools they work with. Thanx
<br>
to Microsoft, people are not ready to do that with computers !!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;*Rant Mode OFF*&lt;&lt;&lt;

<p>Most kind regards,
<br>
<p><p>Arona,
