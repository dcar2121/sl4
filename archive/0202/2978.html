Hi All,
<br>
<p>After lurking on SL4 for about a month, here is my much delayed join post...
<br>
<p>I am 19 years old, and am in the last year of a B.Sc. degree in Computer 
<br>
Science at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.  Before that, I worked as 
<br>
a programmer for several Internet start-ups (all long departed).  When 
<br>
not programming, studying, or thinking about AI, I enjoy typical 
<br>
introverted computer geek activities such as classical music and science 
<br>
fiction.
<br>
<p>I first heard about the Singularity ~1.5 years ago though reading Vernor 
<br>
Vinge, and began to seriously pursue the implications about six months 
<br>
ago.  Since then, I have done a lot of singularity-oriented reading, 
<br>
including GISAI+CFAI, Kurzweil, and Vinge, as well as &quot;mainstream&quot; 
<br>
Cognitive Science, AI and Complex Systems research, such as Douglas 
<br>
Hofstadter, John Holland, David Marr, and (a very small part of) the
<br>
MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences (kudos to Eliezer for the 
<br>
most of the references in this area).
<br>
<p>On the practical side, if anyone has any interesting AI theories that 
<br>
they would like to try and implement and/or test, and are looking for 
<br>
programmers (for free non-profit, or for hire), please get in touch!  I 
<br>
am available part-time right now, and full-time from July.  I would also 
<br>
like to expand my grasp of theory, so if anyone has any books or website 
<br>
that are must-read (particularly intermediate-advanced accounts of 
<br>
theory/research), please also get in touch!
<br>
<p>In summary: I am very intelligent, learn new things quickly, have lots 
<br>
of useful skills, can work reasonably well with other people (including 
<br>
taking orders), and would really like to make a positive, hands-on 
<br>
contribution to the development of what promises to be the coolest 
<br>
software project ever.
<br>
<p>Towards the Singularity...
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Moshe Looks
