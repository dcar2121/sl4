<br>
<p>The Next Web
<br>
<p>Think the World Wide Web is a godsend? By 2005, Tim Berners-Lee aims to be
<br>
replacing it with the Semantic Web, which will understand human language
<br>
<p><p>Whatever else 1955 is remembered for, it boasts two notable birthdays. That
<br>
June, Timothy J. Berners-Lee popped into the world in London, and a few
<br>
months later, William H. Gates III opened his eyes in Seattle. Gates went on
<br>
to become the richest person on earth as head of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT ) Tim
<br>
Berners-Lee might be giving Gates a run for the money, but he passed up his
<br>
shot at fabulous wealth--intentionally--in 1990. That's when he decided not
<br>
to patent the technology used to create the most important software
<br>
innovation in the final decade of the 20th century: the World Wide Web.
<br>
Berners-Lee wanted to make the world a richer place, not amass personal
<br>
wealth. So he gave his brainchild to us all.
<br>
<p>Now, the idealistic father of the Web plans an even grander gift: a
<br>
next-generation Web that almost certainly will rank as the most important
<br>
software of this decade. Berners-Lee regards today's Web as a rebellious
<br>
adolescent that can never fulfill his original expectations. By 2005, he
<br>
hopes to begin replacing it with the Semantic Web--a smart network that will
<br>
finally understand human languages and make computers virtually as easy to
<br>
work with as other humans.
<br>
<p>This new project is a collaborative effort of hundreds of minds, with
<br>
Berners-Lee as maestro. The ultimate goal: to turn the Web into a gigantic
<br>
brain. Every computer connected to the Internet would have access to all the
<br>
knowledge that humankind has accumulated in science, business, and the arts
<br>
since we began painting the walls of caves 30,000 years ago. This racial
<br>
memory would be a constant source of inspiration for dreaming sublime
<br>
dreams, boosting human creativity, and solving previously intractable
<br>
problems. Online commerce chores and Web services would be handled by
<br>
software modules that snap together like toy Lego blocks. &quot;We expect the
<br>
Semantic Web to be as big a revolution as the original Web itself,&quot; says
<br>
Richard Hayes-Roth, Hewlett-Packard Co.'s (HWP ) chief technology officer
<br>
for software.
<br>
<p>To get there, though, Berners-Lee must navigate some very muddy waters.
<br>
Development of the Semantic Web is being funded mainly by the World Wide Web
<br>
Consortium (W3C), which he heads. Founded in 1994 and based at Massachusetts
<br>
Institute of Technology, the W3C is the guardian of Web technology and
<br>
standards. Its budget relies heavily on membership dues from more than 400
<br>
companies. And while making money may not be a primary motivator for
<br>
Berners-Lee, it's what business is all about. Conflicts, in short, were
<br>
inevitable--and not just centering around Berners-Lee. Indeed, mediating the
<br>
inevitable clashes among W3C's hundreds of companies, each with its own
<br>
agenda, will be the acid test of Berners-Lee's leadership.
<br>
<p>A particularly thorny issue cropped up last August. A W3C committee of 13
<br>
members, including IBM (IBM ) and Microsoft, proposed installing tollbooths
<br>
on the Information Highway by allowing patented software to be included in
<br>
W3C-approved standards. The committee reasoned that as online offerings grow
<br>
more sophisticated, the developers of software for handling advanced Web
<br>
services, such as supply-chain management and collaborative engineering,
<br>
should be permitted to collect royalties on their investments. But
<br>
Berners-Lee is philosophically opposed to standards that would impose fees,
<br>
and many other W3C members, such as the Free Software Foundation and the
<br>
Open Source Initiative, also denounced the notion. &quot;Things have calmed down
<br>
a bit,&quot; says Robert S. Sutor, IBM's director of e-business standards, and
<br>
the committee is now rethinking its stance. Berners-Lee says the mood has
<br>
now shifted &quot;strongly toward a royalty-free position.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, the W3C is taking heat on other fronts. Critics say the
<br>
organization is moving too slowly on developing standards to ensure that
<br>
different Web-service offerings can work together. Business sees major
<br>
revenue growth from better tools that can deal with complicated travel
<br>
arrangements, say, or deliver new entertainment options. But companies are
<br>
reluctant to invest in developing such software until big corporations are
<br>
on the same page. What good would it do, for example, to create a program
<br>
under Microsoft's Web-services initiative, dubbed .Net, if it couldn't link
<br>
up with a related program written in Java for Sun Microsystems Inc.'s
<br>
(SUNW ) counterpart? Or if a computer-aided design program at Boeing Corp.
<br>
were unable to talk to the company's engineering or manufacturing software?
<br>
<p>A W3C draft specification aimed at harmonizing Web services was published in
<br>
January, 2001, &quot;but the W3C then sat on its hands for a whole year&quot;
<br>
complains Uttam M. Narsu, an analyst at Giga Information Group. Not until
<br>
late January did the W3C organize several working groups to tackle standards
<br>
for Web services. &quot;My sense is that [W3C staffers] are too visionary,&quot; Narsu
<br>
says. &quot;They're devoting too much effort to the Semantic Web, believing it
<br>
will change the world yet again, and not enough effort to less sexy things
<br>
that are important to business in the near term.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Semantic Web is certainly sexy. As envisioned by Berners-Lee, it would
<br>
understand not only the meaning of words and concepts but also the logical
<br>
relationships among them. That has awesome potential. Most knowledge is
<br>
built on two pillars: semantics and mathematics. In number-crunching,
<br>
computers already outclass people. Machines that are equally adroit at
<br>
dealing with language and reason won't just help people uncover new
<br>
insights; they could blaze new trails on their own.
<br>
<p>Even with a fairly crude version of this future Web, mining online
<br>
repositories for nuggets of knowledge would no longer force people to wade
<br>
through screen after screen of extraneous data. Instead, computers would
<br>
dispatch intelligent agents, or software messengers, to explore Web sites by
<br>
the thousands and logically sift out just what's relevant. That alone would
<br>
provide a major boost in productivity at work and at home. But there's far
<br>
more.
<br>
<p>Software agents could also take on many routine business chores, such as
<br>
helping manufacturers find and negotiate with lowest-cost parts suppliers
<br>
and handling help-desk questions. The Semantic Web would also be a
<br>
bottomless trove of eureka insights. Most inventions and scientific
<br>
breakthroughs, including today's Web, spring from novel combinations of
<br>
existing knowledge. The Semantic Web would make it possible to evaluate more
<br>
combinations overnight than a person could juggle in a lifetime. &quot;A lot of
<br>
scientific research is now interdisciplinary, like global climate change,
<br>
and the scientists need to talk to each other,&quot; says Chaitanya Baru, a
<br>
data-mining expert at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. &quot;But they use
<br>
different jargon.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sure, scientists and other people can post ideas on the Web today for others
<br>
to read. But with machines doing the reading and translating jargon terms,
<br>
related ideas from millions of Web pages could be distilled and summarized.
<br>
That will lift the ability to assess and integrate information to new
<br>
heights.
<br>
<p>As a result, Berners-Lee envisions a new age of enlightenment. The Semantic
<br>
Web, he predicts, &quot;will help more people become more intuitive as well as
<br>
more analytical. It will foster global collaborations among people with
<br>
diverse cultural perspectives, so we have a better chance of finding the
<br>
right solutions to the really big issues--like the environment and climate
<br>
warming.&quot; In short, it will change the world even more than his original
<br>
creation.
<br>
<p>The capital-Q question is: Can he pull it off? There's no shortage of
<br>
doubters. Still, most people who know the reclusive Berners-Lee are
<br>
optimistic. &quot;Tim has a gift for seeing the future and making it happen,&quot;
<br>
says John R. Patrick, a retired IBM senior exec who helped found the W3C.
<br>
Eric E. Schmidt, formerly of Sun and now chairman of search-engine innovator
<br>
Google Inc., says Berners-Lee would be a shoo-in for a Nobel prize--if
<br>
Nobels were given in computer science. And Larry L. Smarr, director of the
<br>
California Institute of Telecommunications &amp; Information Technology at the
<br>
University of California at San Diego, predicts the Semantic Web will cast
<br>
Berners-Lee as &quot;an historic-level figure.&quot;
<br>
<p>What impresses those elder statesmen of computing is Berners-Lee's
<br>
leadership track record. For a somewhat shy software nerd, he has
<br>
demonstrated a surprising flair for diplomacy, combined with bulldog
<br>
tenacity. In the midst of the dot-com bust two years ago, Berners-Lee
<br>
persuaded the W3C's hard-nosed denizens of commerce to begin developing the
<br>
Semantic Web. And before that, in 1998, he persuaded them to approve
<br>
extensible markup language (XML), an important new Web lingo. &quot;Tim did a
<br>
great job shepherding XML through the W3C,&quot; notes Smarr.
<br>
<p>Indeed, the evolution of XML may be a useful foretaste of what's in store
<br>
for the Berners-Lee's new vision. In the late 1990s, this language was
<br>
constructed to help computers identify different types of data on the Web.
<br>
&quot;When we started work on XML, it was considered pretty esoteric,&quot; recalls
<br>
Sutor of IBM. &quot;But now it's the underpinnings of everything we're doing in
<br>
e-business.&quot; Ditto for hundreds of others, including the 300 companies
<br>
already using XML software from Open Applications Group Inc. OAGI predicts
<br>
that number will double this year.
<br>
<p>Berners-Lee worked tirelessly to win support for XML because it's a quantum
<br>
leap beyond today's witless hypertext markup language (HTML)--and it's the
<br>
cornerstone of the Semantic Web. HTML is the language that Berners-Lee
<br>
concocted while on a fellowship as a database engineer at the European
<br>
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva. But the language merely
<br>
specifies the appearance of a Web page: what colors go where, which type
<br>
sizes to use, and where to put graphic elements. To a Web browser, or most
<br>
other computer programs, these words and numbers are just squiggles of
<br>
gibberish. Without some kind of clue, computers parsing a Web page can't
<br>
determine if &quot;buy&quot; is a noun or a verb, or whether &quot;20031&quot; is a Zip Code, a
<br>
price, or the number of orders placed last month.
<br>
<p>In contrast, XML tags imbue the Web with meaning. Examples might be such
<br>
labels as , and for medical records. The &quot;name&quot; tag would have links to
<br>
relevant sections of online literature, also coded with XML, and
<br>
&quot;interaction&quot; would point to other drugs that interfere with the medication.
<br>
Then, when a doctor bats out a prescription on a computer, a software agent
<br>
could verify that the drug is appropriate for the diagnosis, check the
<br>
patient's records to see what other medicines the person is taking, and
<br>
determine whether any of them is likely to interfere with the new
<br>
prescription. A group of university and industrial researchers is already
<br>
working on such a scheme with the Veterans Administration and the National
<br>
Library of Medicine.
<br>
<p>Without Berners-Lee's dogged persistence, today's Web might never have
<br>
hatched at CERN. But he pulled it off, right under the disapproving noses of
<br>
senior management.
<br>
<p>To physicists around the world, CERN's huge atom-smashing collider, which
<br>
traces a 17-mile-long circle beneath the Swiss-French border, is a kind of
<br>
Alpine mecca. Part of Berners-Lee's job was to keep track of who was where,
<br>
doing what, and using which kind of computer. That was a major headache for
<br>
the young researcher, who admits to having a bad memory for names and faces.
<br>
Twice he proposed a pre-Web database that would store data on thousands of
<br>
researchers and help organize the results of their work into an
<br>
institutional memory. Both times his idea got spurned.
<br>
<p>Undeterred, Berners-Lee then went underground and cajoled a small band of
<br>
cohorts, including his Belgian-born supervisor, Robert Cailliau, to help
<br>
create the original Web on the sly. Even after the first prototype was done
<br>
and winning converts in the outside world, convincing CERN's staff of its
<br>
utility took several months, with Cailliau playing the role of Web salesman.
<br>
Berners-Lee praises the contributions of Cailliau and the other
<br>
co-conspirators in his 1999 book, Weaving the Web. &quot;Tim's a very modest
<br>
person, and he has been careful to credit the people who've worked with
<br>
him,&quot; says Vinton G. Cerf, senior vice-president at WorldCom Inc., who
<br>
helped spawn the Internet in the early 1970s as a medium for scientific
<br>
collaborations.
<br>
<p>Cailliau and Berners-Lee considered forming a startup to commercialize the
<br>
Web, but they quickly nixed the notion. That was 1990, a hectic year for
<br>
Berners-Lee. He got married, made the momentous decision not to patent the
<br>
Web software, and, on Christmas Day, switched on the world's first Web-site
<br>
server.
<br>
<p>Even though Berners-Lee has little time for anything other than software and
<br>
family, he does occasionally play the piano, &quot;but I'm terrible at it,&quot; he
<br>
confesses. He won't talk much about his private life, but he admits to
<br>
feeling a tug from the theater. While at CERN, he helped out backstage at
<br>
the Geneva English Drama Society and played bit parts, including Nana, the
<br>
dog in Peter Pan. That's where he met his future wife, Nancy Carlson, a
<br>
software analyst from Fairfield, Conn. She was working at the World Health
<br>
Organization and managing the little theater group in the evening.
<br>
<p>Today, Berners-Lee presides over a research octopus whose tentacles extend
<br>
to all five continents. The 60 staffers at W3C headquarters coordinate the
<br>
efforts of hundreds of researchers at 50 university and government
<br>
laboratories that are W3C members, plus two-score additional universities
<br>
around the world. For now, most of the actual work on the Semantic Web is
<br>
being done by academics because, Berners-Lee quips, &quot;only a few industry
<br>
people have been given a little leeway to go off and explore my crazy
<br>
ideas.&quot;
<br>
<p>Those ideas spring from a childhood fascination with computers--encouraged
<br>
by parents who both were mathematicians and computer-science pioneers.
<br>
Conway Berners-Lee and Mary Lee Woods met in the early 1950s while on the
<br>
team that developed the Ferranti Mark 1 computer. Their first son was
<br>
treated to breakfast discussions about programming and dinner-table talk of
<br>
abstract math and imaginary numbers. As a child, Tim built let's-pretend
<br>
computers from cardboard boxes and drew miniature pictures by connecting the
<br>
holes in the punched paper tape that was then used to load programs into
<br>
computers. At Oxford University's Queen's College, he studied physics,
<br>
graduating with honors in 1976. &quot;Physics was a compromise,&quot; he says, between
<br>
two loves--math and engineering.
<br>
<p>As Berners-Lee readily admits, all the components of the Web already existed
<br>
when he arrived at CERN. His main contribution was writing the software to
<br>
combine them cohesively. The Internet was commonly used to exchange
<br>
scientific reports, but there were no point-and-click links: You had to type
<br>
in arcane commands and addresses. There were hypertext programs with
<br>
clickable links, but each version was tailored for a specific breed of
<br>
computer--and often for a single location--each with its own peculiar
<br>
command-line entries.
<br>
<p>Berners-Lee tore down this Tower of Babel, making it a breeze to share
<br>
information. Uniform resource locators (URLs) established a common format
<br>
for Web-page addresses, and HTML ensured that Web pages always looked the
<br>
same. The new tools spread quickly among researchers, but the public didn't
<br>
pay much heed because the Web remained a slave to abstruse typed-in
<br>
commands.
<br>
<p>What launched the Web's explosive growth was the now-familiar browser,
<br>
pioneered by Netscape Communications Corp. Berners-Lee still chafes at
<br>
Netscape's one-way limitation. From the outset, he thought the Web should be
<br>
a two-way street, with browsers making it easy to create and annotate Web
<br>
pages. Removing this limitation is one of the goals of the Semantic Web.
<br>
<p>XML is a start--but only the tip of the iceberg. XML tags are essentially
<br>
just labels that point to a definition in a combination dictionary and
<br>
thesaurus. That's how a software agent can determine that two different tags
<br>
actually mean the same thing--say, and . When an agent needs further
<br>
details, there's an online encyclopedia, called an ontology. It lays out the
<br>
logical rules and relationships among XML terms.
<br>
<p>Merging these elements is where semantics gets sticky. Because we humans
<br>
assimilate language gradually, we end up unaware of how complicated things
<br>
are--until we try to construct a new digital grammar from scratch, with
<br>
numerous dialects for various industries. Devising software that can
<br>
comprehend words, concepts, and relationships has long been a major hangup
<br>
in artificial intelligence (AI) research. Adding a pervasive layer of
<br>
standardization will test the limits of human ingenuity--and patience.
<br>
<p>In the fast-paced Internet Age, the time needed to build consensus on the
<br>
smallest of these details could be the Semantic Web's chief obstacle, says
<br>
MCI's Cerf. He worries that standards could &quot;fall victim to business
<br>
maneuvering&quot; by the W3C's corporate members. The result might end up similar
<br>
to today's systems for electronic data interchange (EDI)--with a lot of
<br>
proprietary systems, each with its own lingo. On the other hand, partly
<br>
because the industry is acutely aware of EDI's problems and limitations,
<br>
executives are optimistic. &quot;It'll be a chicken-or-egg situation until a
<br>
killer app comes along--but I'm very confident that that will happen,&quot; says
<br>
W. Daniel Hillis, a supercomputer pioneer who now heads startup Applied
<br>
Minds Inc.
<br>
<p>Some academics are enthusiastic about the corporate involvement that
<br>
Berners-Lee has attracted. James A. Hendler, a computer scientist at the
<br>
University of Maryland, says he has worked on AI for 20 years and &quot;it has
<br>
been almost impossible to get the attention of business.&quot; But now, he says,
<br>
&quot;the advances we made in the 1990s are being readied for actual use with the
<br>
Semantic Web, out there in the real world.&quot;
<br>
<p>One other factor could give Berners-Lee's vision an enormous boost: The
<br>
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is pushing it.
<br>
This is the outfit that created the guts of the Internet three decades ago.
<br>
In 1998, it launched the DARPA Agent MarkUp Language (DAML)
<br>
program--initially managed by Hendler, who took a leave of absence from
<br>
Maryland. DARPA is now a W3C member, and DAML is being developed in concert
<br>
with XML.
<br>
<p>DARPA wants to develop agent-based systems for command-and-control jobs in
<br>
joint military operations, whether they be multiservice or multinational.
<br>
For example, an international team of 16 organizations--led by a spin-off of
<br>
Britain's Defense Ministry called QinetiQ Ltd.--is working on a &quot;coalition
<br>
of agents&quot; project. With DAML tags pointing to online databases, plus access
<br>
to satellite reconnaissance images, the agents would be aware of the
<br>
capabilities and locations of the many different weapons and logistics
<br>
systems deployed to such spots as Afghanistan. So they could provide
<br>
commanders with instant advice for coping with shifting conditions.
<br>
<p>DARPA is also funding research at MIT, headed by Berners-Lee but separate
<br>
from the W3C, aimed at creating new AI tools for tomorrow's Web. One result
<br>
would be Semantic Web logic language (Swell). Another goal is to marry the
<br>
Semantic Web with MIT's Oxygen project, which aims to make various digital
<br>
systems as easy to use as breathing, thanks to advanced machine-learning
<br>
tricks and new AI software. Cailliau, Berners-Lee's former boss at CERN,
<br>
figures the Web's inventor relishes this research. &quot;I think Tim does not
<br>
really like the role&quot; of leading a big outfit like the W3C, says Cailliau.
<br>
&quot;He is more comfortable with a small team [and] joining in the fun of
<br>
writing actual code.&quot;
<br>
<p>Berners-Lee admits that building consensus among the W3C's members can be
<br>
trying at times. But someone needs to keep development of the Semantic Web
<br>
on course toward enriching the world--and nobody is better qualified than
<br>
Tim.
