I just ask:  what do you mean by self-modification at all?
<br>
<p>An implementation has many levels: if you have a single executable which 
<br>
operates on some data
<br>
, then the source code is constant, but the data changes. If you change 
<br>
or recompile the executable,
<br>
then the operation system is constant. If you recompile the operation 
<br>
system, then
<br>
the instruction set of the processor remains constant. If you have an 
<br>
FPGA and restructure it
<br>
then the basis-structure of the FPGA is constant. If you reengineer your 
<br>
complete hardware, then
<br>
the laws of the physics stay constant. Of course finer distinctions are 
<br>
also possible.
<br>
<p>I guess,  you argued that the machine-code representation of the 
<br>
executable won't change in the
<br>
first phase of the development of AI. I agree, but I still think that an 
<br>
intelligent entity must have a high
<br>
degree of flexibility. So, the question is not really whether self 
<br>
modification is needed, but the type of self
<br>
modification needed. I also agree with Eugene that a somewhat 
<br>
intelligent AI must possess
<br>
a high degree of freedom (space for improvement,ability to 
<br>
learn,whatever you call it) and
<br>
roobustness on the same time. Balancing this two will probably be a very 
<br>
essential aspect
<br>
of constructing an AI. One of the most sensible tasks at all. (But I 
<br>
don't state that it is the only task.)
<br>
And this is, most probably, not a static issue: you can't say that some 
<br>
given balance is optimal for all AIs.
<br>
It is imaginable, that in the first phase you'll have to &quot;add&quot; more and 
<br>
more flexibility to your AI as
<br>
ve gets increasingly intelligent.  Perhaps you will have a lot of steps 
<br>
in increasing ver freedom,  without
<br>
allowing to modify ver machine code executable. The last steps in 
<br>
increasing ver freedom from a
<br>
constant executable to complete self-reengineering within the laws of 
<br>
physics, will take much less
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>It seems to be similar to the development of a child: first time he has 
<br>
no freedoms at all, because
<br>
he would harm himself, but you can give him more and more freedoms as he 
<br>
learns to survive them.
<br>
<p>Of course this is merely philosophy.  I just wanted to point out that we 
<br>
don't have possibility A,B and C,
<br>
but possibility a0.0, ... possibility a0.2332 ... possibility a1.0. 
<br>
(probably on a much higher dimensional scale.)
<br>
<p>Best regards, Christian
