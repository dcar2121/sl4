hi eugene etc.,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm of course disagreeing that general intelligence is codable by a team
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human programmers due to the usual complexity bareer,
</em><br>
<p>I have never understood your &quot;complexity barrier&quot; argument as anything but
<br>
an intuition.
<br>
<p>You're quite welcome to your pessimistic intuition on this point, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but for the sake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of argument: let's assume it's feasible. It seems that introspection and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self manipulation requires a very specific knowledge base -- compare, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance a human hacking human brain morphology box, or fiddling with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genome for the ion channels expressed in the CNS. This is nothing like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; navigating during a pub crawl, or building a robot. Very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge base.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that goal-directed self-modification is a specialized mental
<br>
function, similar (very roughly speaking) to, say, vision processing, or
<br>
mathematical reasoning, or social interaction.  However, also like these
<br>
other things, it will be achieved by a combination of general intelligence
<br>
processes with more specialized heuristics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It may also use various functions and applications of high-level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence as low level glue, which is an application closed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; humans, but that doesn't necessarily imply robust modification of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; low-level code base; it need only imply robust modification of any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the cognitive structures that would ordinarily be modified by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brainware system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you're modifying internal code, and are dumping that into low level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compilable result? You could cloak brittleness that way (assuming, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design for it), but you'd lose efficiency, and hence utilize the hardware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which is not much to start with, even a decade from now) very badly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losing orders of magnitude of performance that way.
</em><br>
<p>I think you are wrong about losing &quot;orders of magnitude&quot; of performance.
<br>
If you have any detailed calculations to back up this estimate, please
<br>
share them.
<br>
<p>My own experience, based on prototyping in this space for a while, is that
<br>
you will lose about order of magnitude of performance by doing self-
<br>
modification in a *properly optimized* high-level language rather than in a
<br>
low-level language like C++.
<br>
<p>Our first self-modification experiments in Novamente (our new AI system,
<br>
the Webmind successor) will not involve Novamente rewriting its C++ source,
<br>
but rather Novamente rewriting what we call &quot;schema&quot; that control its
<br>
cognitive functioning (which are equivalent to programs in our own
<br>
high-level
<br>
language, that we call Sasha (named after our departed collaborator Sasha
<br>
Chislenko)).
<br>
<p>In the first-draft Novamente schema module, executing a schema
<br>
will about 2 orders of mag. slower
<br>
than executing an analogous C++ program, but this is because the first-draft
<br>
schema module will not embody sophisticated schema optimization procedures.
<br>
We have a fairly detailed design for a second-version schema module that
<br>
we believe will narrow the performance gap to within 1 order of magnitude.
<br>
<p>Why accept a 1 order of magnitude slowdown?  Because we are *confronting*
<br>
the complexity barrier you  mention rather than hiding in fear from it.
<br>
Novamente is very complex, both in its design and in its emergent behaviors,
<br>
but we are working to keep it manageably complex.  In our judgment, having
<br>
the system modify schema (Sasha programs) rather than C++ source is a big
<br>
help
<br>
in keeping the complexity manageable.  And this added manageability is more
<br>
than
<br>
worth an order of magnitude slowdown.
<br>
<p>Eli and I are fashioning solutions (or trying!!) whereas you are pointing
<br>
out
<br>
potential problems.  There is nothing wrong with pointing out problems;
<br>
however,
<br>
it is a fact that both the nature of the problems and the potential
<br>
workarounds that
<br>
exist become far clearer once one starts working at solving the problems,
<br>
rather than
<br>
just talking about them.
<br>
