<em>&gt; Maybe we disagree on what the purpose of an FAQ should be.  If my FAQ was

</em><br>
<p>Hm.  I think your document is much better structured than Gordon's (sorry,
<br>
Gordon!) so mostly the objections don't apply as much to yours.  However,
<br>
I still remember one or two cases where I thought the explanation was too
<br>
sparse.  Specifically:
<br>
<p>&quot;A Sysop is, by definition, the least intrusive system that can protect
<br>
the freedoms of all within its care and, by extension, secure the future
<br>
of humanity.&quot;
<br>
<p>I worry that most people are going to read this and think &quot;Prove it&quot;.  The
<br>
problem is that &quot;by definition&quot; is often used in senses other than the
<br>
rationally proper one, so to send the right signal takes a stronger
<br>
phrasing, like:  &quot;A Sysop is supposed to be the least intrusive system
<br>
that can protect the freedoms of all within its care and, by extension,
<br>
secure the future of humanity.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree that it wouldn't hurt to beef up some of the answers by providing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more metaphors and links.  I intend to do this.  But I think it would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake to project the idea that CFAI proves a Sysop to be the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embodiment of Friendliness.  I didn't think this was your position;  If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, I confess to having missed the whole point of CFAI.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I was contrasting your version to Gordon's (sorry, Gordon!).
<br>
<p>The problem is that it's not quite clear that your document is meant to be
<br>
descriptive rather than persuasive.  It's a trick of the language, I
<br>
think.  When I look at a Q like &quot;Why would we need a special system to
<br>
ensure our individual and collective protection?&quot; it seems like the Q is
<br>
being asked by an individual who is skeptical of the Sysop Scenario,
<br>
rather than a person who wants to know more about what the Sysop Scenario
<br>
is; therefore, when I read the answer, I'm sort of looking at it as being
<br>
of the form &quot;This is why you need this special system&quot;, not &quot;This is why
<br>
some people think you need this special system.&quot;  The ubiquitous use of
<br>
&quot;We wouldn't, necessarily&quot; is a good start but doesn't quite dispel the
<br>
expectation.  What it really needs is an agnostic phrasing for the
<br>
questions, or an intro where it explicitly says &quot;I am not for or against
<br>
the Sysop scenario, just trying to describe it.&quot;
