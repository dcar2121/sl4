<em>&gt; Yes, I should have made it more clear.  I am suggesting that the Sysop

<p>That is impossible.  A Sysop is not a philosophy.  A Sysop is a physical
<br>
system that may or not exist at some point in our future.
<br>
<p>Our concept of the Sysop may be a tautology.  If any of our concepts have
<br>
the cognitive property of tautology than they must automatically be wrong,
<br>
or at the least must automatically possess no force as a rational
<br>
argument, with respect to the external referent of the Sysop.
<br>
<p>We aren't doing philosophical exploration for the sake of philosophical
<br>
exploration, we're taking current knowledge and projecting it forward. 
<br>
Arguing that something is demonstrated &quot;by definition&quot; in the Sysop
<br>
Scenario turns it all into a philosophical game; what matters are simply
<br>
those things that are likely to actually appear within our own future. 
<br>
This is not an attempt to determine what happens if some hypothetical
<br>
entity existed with an arbitrarily defined set of defined powers.  This is
<br>
an attempt to extrapolate events that may actually occur to humanity at
<br>
some point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but this makes sense and isn't really bad since, if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sysop is basically making it impossible to violate someone's volition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or whatever), then ve is setting up a system where ve is always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unhackable.  In short, the Sysop sets the rules, so it's very easy to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>1)  &quot;In short, the Sysop sets the rules&quot;
<br>
<p>2)  &quot;so&quot;
<br>
<p>3)  &quot;it's very easy to make sure&quot;
<br>
<p>4)  &quot;that not being hacked is in those rules&quot;
<br>
<p>and we have the objections:
<br>
<p>1)  The degree to which the Sysop sets the rules is precisely the point in
<br>
dispute;
<br>
<p>2)  The &quot;so&quot; is therefore arguing from the point of the dispute;
<br>
<p>3)  Whether it is &quot;easy&quot; to prevent high-level hacking given sovereignty
<br>
over low-level operations and superintelligence is again precisely the
<br>
point of dispute;
<br>
<p>4)  Whether it is possible to implement the high-level goal of &quot;not being
<br>
hacked&quot; in the low-level &quot;rules&quot; is again the dispute.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, as I mentioned, just because that's how it works in theory doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that attacks are impossible.
</em><br>
<p>It can't work that way &quot;in theory&quot; - who invented the theory?  What was
<br>
their justification for hypothesizing this as part of a real Sysop
<br>
Scenario?  At what point did someone, extrapolating forward from current
<br>
knowledge, say &quot;The Sysop sets the rules&quot;?  If you want to rely on &quot;The
<br>
Sysop sets the rules&quot; to argue something, your argument can't be any
<br>
stronger than the reasons behind the person saying &quot;The Sysop sets the
<br>
rules&quot;.  The first rule of competent philosophy is to never argue from
<br>
definitions.  If you want to determine whether the ability to &quot;set the
<br>
rules&quot; is strong enough to accomplish something, you look at the reasons
<br>
to think that a Sysop &quot;setting the rules&quot; is a possibility in the first
<br>
place, and this tells you what you can rationally say about the details
<br>
and specifics of these rules and the way they are set.
<br>
<p>We have some grounds to think that a superintelligence might be able to
<br>
get low-level control over all local material reality, because we can
<br>
visualize this as the result of nanotechnological competence by a
<br>
singleton SI.  When we say &quot;make the rules&quot;, what we really mean is
<br>
&quot;control reality on a low level&quot;.  We are now asking the question &quot;Does
<br>
the ability to control reality on a low level suffice for immunity to
<br>
perversion attacks?&quot;  You cannot generalize &quot;the ability to control
<br>
low-level reality&quot; into &quot;making the rules&quot;, and then argue from this
<br>
generalized definition that &quot;prevent perversion attacks&quot; is a subcategory
<br>
of &quot;making the rules&quot;.  *That* is just a philosophical bait-and-switch.
