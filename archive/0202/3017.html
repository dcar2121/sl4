seem that the both processes are quite dependent on who does the

division into subsystems and how well that person or those

really good systems require a really good system architect and

perhaps some good subsystem architects.  It also helps if there

are some reuse and simplification people/agents involved who

notice recurring patterns and connections to other projects that

may simplify or improve the project or suggest future

&quot;infrastructure&quot; projects giving more leverage to the person or

<p>What is difficult is to grow complexity without increasingly 
<br>
burdensome manual procedures (meeting and documentation blight). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some level of automation of high order could be very helpful

here.  A few things have been tried to date with fairly limited,

although helpful, results.

<em>&gt; As a result I predict that human software engineers coding an AI

<em>&gt;&gt;I agree that goal-directed self-modification is a specialized mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;function, similar (very roughly speaking) to, say, vision processing, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mathematical reasoning, or social interaction.  However, also like these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;other things, it will be achieved by a combination of general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;intelligence processes with more specialized heuristics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I correct to assume that we're talking about explicit codification of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge destilled from human experts? Is there any reason to suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we're going to do any better than Lenat &amp; Co? The record track so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not overwhelming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, there is also the problem that goal-directed modification 
<br>
of software is not very well developed even among human experts 
<br>
to date.  We can optimize some small-scale things rather well. 
<br>
We have some rules of thumb and ways of improving some rather 
<br>
formal software specifications and tests for certain types of 
<br>
goodness but not a great deal else.  A really good human 
<br>
software designer tweaks a system not just by formal rules but 
<br>
by some much softer and even artistic considerations also.  And 
<br>
the limits of such improvements as well as the cost are fairly 
<br>
well appreciated.  Actually though, most software can be 
<br>
improved by an order of magnitude (across a range of desirable 
<br>
traits, not just performance) without much specialized knowledge 
<br>
at all.  It usually isn't thus improved for reasons like the 
<br>
original software being a known quantity in terms of 
<br>
maintenance/bug fix/performance and unwillingness to take a 
<br>
chance (however small) on breakage, or more to the point, on 
<br>
proving that breakage did not occur.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Our first self-modification experiments in Novamente (our new AI system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the Webmind successor) will not involve Novamente rewriting its C++
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;source, but rather Novamente rewriting what we call &quot;schema&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;control its cognitive functioning (which are equivalent to programs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;our own high-level language, that we call Sasha (named after our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;departed collaborator Sasha Chislenko)).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You will let us know, how well self modification will do, will you? This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a genuinely interesting experiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In the first-draft Novamente schema module, executing a schema will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about 2 orders of mag. slower than executing an analogous C++ program,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;but this is because the first-draft schema module will not embody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;sophisticated schema optimization procedures. We have a fairly detailed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;design for a second-version schema module that we believe will narrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the performance gap to within 1 order of magnitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Why accept a 1 order of magnitude slowdown?  Because we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;*confronting* the complexity barrier you mention rather than hiding in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;fear from it. Novamente is very complex, both in its design and in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bootstrap requires *more* resources, not less of it. Nonchalance about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losing touch with bare metal in bootstrap design phase sounds very wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p><p>But the final optimization to bare metal or close to it is very 
<br>
different than higher language and conceptual optimizations.  It 
<br>
is also a more general job than a particular project type like 
<br>
AI.  It is important to properly divide effort.  Humans and 
<br>
possibly some layers of a self-modifying AI need to work with 
<br>
clean, powerful conceptual tools and procedures that give wings 
<br>
to thought, if you will, and ease understanding and maintenance. 
<br>
At a very differently level of optimization that is highly 
<br>
automated and can arguably only be done in bulk by computer, 
<br>
automization closer to the metal while preserving important (how 
<br>
to mark these?) invariants is done.  Both large scale 
<br>
inefficient but expressive work and eventual encoding into 
<br>
highly efficient executables is required.  But they should not 
<br>
be confused or conflated.  Doing so has killed many a project.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;emergent behaviors, but we are working to keep it manageably complex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;In our judgment, having the system modify schema (Sasha programs) rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;than C++ source is a big help in keeping the complexity manageable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And this added manageability is more than worth an order of magnitude
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;slowdown.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>YES.  The slowdown can be factored out at least in part at a 
<br>
later stage of the process.
