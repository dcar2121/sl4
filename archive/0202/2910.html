<p>My oh my, I thought that I could write `right' here not have this 
<br>
happen.  Oh well.
<br>
<p>By `right' I simply mean whatever is accepted as being beneficial 
<br>
behavior.  Human moral theories are mostly designed to maximize 
<br>
reproductive potential (selfish genes) and most humans consider 
<br>
increasing the chances of reproduction beneficial (at least the lower 
<br>
parts of their minds do, anyway).  But, look at moral theories and 
<br>
you'll see debris.  The people who wrote the moral theories were humans 
<br>
with biases and wrote them in such a way to benefit their own genes 
<br>
more.  This isn't always true, but is true in general.  There's a 
<br>
statistically significant number to make my case, anyway.  :-P
<br>
<p>An SI would have a different sense of what is beneficial behavior, but 
<br>
not by much.  I think it's a fair extrapolation that an SI would 
<br>
consider continued existence beneficial.  In addition, SIs are likely to 
<br>
think that it's beneficial to live comfortably.  Still, what is right to 
<br>
an SI is different than from humans.  Furthermore, right would hopefully 
<br>
be more objective as genetically programmed biases never even get 
<br>
started (in AIs) or are worked out as the upload transcends.  Right gets 
<br>
more right, so to say.
<br>
<p>I chose to write `right' because that's more accurate than `Friendly'.  
<br>
Friendliness is likely in the same spirit as what will be right for SIs, 
<br>
but not the same thing.  We should expect SIs to come up with a theory 
<br>
that's better than Friendliness pretty shortly.  Remember, all that 
<br>
Friendliness has to do is produce a fairly super intelligent AI that's 
<br>
safe so that we have a safe starting point for entering the 
<br>
Singularity.  I fully expect a better theory to be developed at some 
<br>
point by the SIs.  If Friendliness is still in use post Singularity, 
<br>
either Eliezer did an amazing job coming up with Friendliness or our 
<br>
Singularity has failed to reach its full potential.
