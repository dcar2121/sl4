<p>
I’ve been linked to the SL4 list now for about two months, and I’m only now
<br>
taking the time to do a joiner.  It’s been busy…sorry.
<br>
<p>My name is Tim Kyger.  I’m 46, fat, and increasingly dyspeptic.  One
<br>
stepdaughter, a dwarf, who has just started college.  One daughter, 5, with
<br>
ADHD, who has begun kindergarten.  One son, 2, who is busy tearing the house
<br>
down.  Myself, I have a rare genetic liver disease (Wilson’s) -- my claim to
<br>
some sort of uniqueness (one of only 1800 identified in the U.S., FWIW…)
<br>
Easily treated in my case, luckily; I am asymptomatic and always have been.
<br>
<p>I’ve been a space freak, for want of a better term, all my life; my earliest
<br>
memory is Sputnik.  I was born at Nellis AFB, Las Vegas, NV; someone has to
<br>
be.  &lt;grin&gt;  One of my earliest memories is of watching Echo 1 transit
<br>
overhead, laying on chaise lounges with my Dad and our-then next door
<br>
neighbor Mike Collins.
<br>
<p>My Dad had to tell me in early 1960 that the TV show “Men Into Space” was
<br>
*fiction,* and that we didn’t have any Moonbase.  I’ve been mad as hell
<br>
about it ever since.
<br>
<p>I did the usual stuff as a kid of that time and place did – I was a early
<br>
reader, reading books on space which lead to reading science fiction.  Made
<br>
the typical f/8 6in. Newtonian reflector as a kid while involved with the
<br>
Miami Valley Astronomical Society (we were now at Wright-Patterson AFB,
<br>
Dayton, OH).  Played with a PDP-11 in 1970 (paper tape!).  Got involved with
<br>
S.F. fandom in ’71 or so.  I left home when I turned 18 (escaping a very
<br>
weird family life), and moved to Phoenix, AZ; went to ASU, studying
<br>
aeronautical engineering.  Ended up being the Chair of the 36th World
<br>
Science Fiction Convention, Phoenix, 1978 – I was 22.  But I’d already by
<br>
that time figured out that I needed to grow up, and that I needed to leave
<br>
fandom behind.  I had found that I was interested in politics in the real
<br>
world and fandom, alas, is not the real world.  (I would maintain that it is
<br>
instead a very largish sheaf of simulators…)
<br>
<p>Moved to San Francisco and during the ‘80s worked in Silicon Valley as a
<br>
telecom engineer (I worked for Southern Pacific Communications before it
<br>
became Sprint, FWIW), or as a tech writer or editor, depending upon the
<br>
company involved, all the while also being very involved with the L5
<br>
Society, which I had joined in 1977.  Ran the 3rd L5 Society annual
<br>
convention (now the NSS’ “ISDC” – love those ETLAs…).  Worked for Phil Salin
<br>
and Gayle Pergamit for a few months ( long story); also ran into Chris
<br>
Peterson and Eric Drexler circa 1979 or so, and thus have been aware of
<br>
nanotech/mnt (whatever we’re going to be told to call it this month) from
<br>
almost the very beginning.
<br>
<p>I moved to Washington, D.C. April 1989 to work for Congressman Dana
<br>
Rohrabacher as his space staffer; I worked for Dana for six years.  My job
<br>
highlight there was to keep the DC-X program funded and going.  I then went
<br>
to the Senate to work as a space staffer/expert for the Senate Commerce
<br>
Committee’s Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space (that’s a small
<br>
subject area, eh?).  I worked there two years – right up until the new
<br>
Chair, John McCain, fired us all.  (Senator Pressler had lost his election,
<br>
and we had worked for Pressler.)  Pete Conrad hired me, and that’s the
<br>
company I work for now, Universal Space Network.  We’re a commercial TT&amp;C
<br>
provider.  You got a spacecraft that needs to talk to the ground, we’re the
<br>
phone company; you can buy our services by the “call” or by some other
<br>
agreed upon time period.  We do LEOPs, too (launch and early orbit
<br>
operations).
<br>
<p>I’ve been aware of the subject matter of mnt/nanotech/cryonics/etc. for
<br>
quite a while, since the mid ‘80s for most of it, but I’m not sure that I
<br>
got the full load of SL3/SL4 stuff until about 1998 or 1999-ish.  Where?
<br>
How?  I don’t really know.  I do know that when I read Greg Egan’s “The
<br>
Planck Dive”in (I think) 1999 that my reaction was, “Yow!  That all makes
<br>
*sense!*  (And yes, I don’t take Greg Egan’s work as gospel; he’s just a
<br>
writer trying to sell copy to put food on his table.  It was the general
<br>
trajectory of what he was talking about that I responded well to.)
<br>
<p>It wasn’t until recently that I finally read anything by Vinge, even though
<br>
the concept of the Singularity was something I have been familiar with since
<br>
the early ‘90s.  Memes get around.
<br>
<p>Anyway, here I am.  If I have something to say that will actually contribute
<br>
to the discussion I will.  Otherwise, I’ll read and ponder what you all have
<br>
to say.
