hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, merely expressing a well known truth about software engineering.. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only about software engineering, engineering in general. Minds are one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing: complex. Look at the hardware layer, it is that very obviously. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're getting increased evidence that these structures are indeed doing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot, are not very reducible. This is not an intuition, I can cite you a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few papers indicating that there's not much averaging going on. Each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incoming bit of info from the trenches makes me lose any residual optimism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is an intuitive assessement of a diverse, messy, inconclusive
<br>
and in-process body of scientific knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's a bareer to the complexity of a system you can build as a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person. Different persons have different ceilings, mine is quite low.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Teams do not really scale in that regard. A ceiling of a group is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dramatically higher than of a single individual, and the ceiling of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large group can be actually lower. This is basic software engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>The Novamente project right now involves 7 people, and our complexity
<br>
ceiling is *dramatically* higher than that of any one of us, because we
<br>
communicate very well together, and have different strengths and weaknesses
<br>
and inclinations.
<br>
<p>I think we could add about 5 more people to the group (assuming they were
<br>
draw from our existing pool of known-to-be-compatible people) before we
<br>
reached a point where effectiveness stopped increasing significantly with
<br>
each new person.
<br>
<p>The Webmind Inc. AI team definitely reached a point where each new person
<br>
added contributed only incrementally to total productivity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; General intelligence is not property of a simple system. Far from it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a result I predict that human software engineers coding an AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly (i.e. using not stochastic/noisy/evolutionary methods) are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to fall short of the goal.
</em><br>
<p>And as I said, you're welcome to your pessimistic intuition ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I agree that goal-directed self-modification is a specialized mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; function, similar (very roughly speaking) to, say, vision processing, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mathematical reasoning, or social interaction.  However, also like these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other things, it will be achieved by a combination of general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligence processes with more specialized heuristics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I correct to assume that we're talking about explicit codification of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge destilled from human experts? Is there any reason to suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we're going to do any better than Lenat &amp; Co? The record track so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not overwhelming.
</em><br>
<p>You are not correct in your assumption.
<br>
<p>I think that explicit codification will play at most a supporting role, not
<br>
a central role.
<br>
<p>As I've said before, I think the Mizar (www.mizar.org) corpus of
<br>
mathematical knowledge may play a valuable role at some point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Um, C++ can easily lose an order of magnitude of performance over C, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't know what you're doing. Not to mention tweaking the compiler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flags, and jiggle the code, trying to not run into performance killers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (longword align, for instance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We seem to mean very different systems, when speaking high-performance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The absence of high-performance computing types in AI is notable.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this barb may be appropriate when aimed at me, but not at my
<br>
Novamente-team colleagues who are doing most of the C++ programming.  They
<br>
are pretty damn good C programmers.  We are in fact not incurring much OO
<br>
overhead in our codebase right now; most of the code is straight ANSI C,
<br>
with object-orientation only used carefully and in ways that do not cause
<br>
significant performance penalties.
<br>
<p>In general, I think there are plenty of high-performance computing types in
<br>
traditional academic AI.  Look at the people who made Deep Thought, later
<br>
transformed into Deep Blue.  The problem in my view is a lack of &quot;general
<br>
intelligence&quot; types.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Um, implementing a runaway AI is certainly not my problem. I'm interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in modelling biological organisms, which does not involve such dangerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components. This is the wrong forum to discuss it, however.
</em><br>
<p>Biotechnology has many potential dangers associated with it as well.
<br>
Perhaps your work in particular does not, however.
<br>
