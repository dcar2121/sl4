<p>
I just read The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer at
<br>
<a href="http://www.jargon.8hz.com/jargon_49.html">http://www.jargon.8hz.com/jargon_49.html</a> . Everyone knows that Real
<br>
Programmers write in machine code or assembly, their code is self modifying
<br>
and is tightly coupled with the hardware and maybe the OS. Modern
<br>
programmers use higher-level languages such as C, LISP, etc. and rely on the
<br>
compiler to optimize the code. Modern operating systems (including MSDOS?)
<br>
have a memory manager to protect the code section of a process from being
<br>
modified.
<br>
<p>When creating a seed AI, is it still wise to use a component-based
<br>
architecture with an OS that provides memory protection? Is top-down
<br>
programming going to give a seed AI any advantage over a bottom-up
<br>
implementation? So what if we don't understand it, so long as a few people
<br>
do and they don't all die at the same time, why shouldn't we get the latest
<br>
PC or supercomputer, start hacking in self-modifying assembly for the first
<br>
generation of seed AI? Not an easy task I know, but we have hardware
<br>
emulators or virtual machine software to help debug the seed during
<br>
development.
<br>
<p>I know there are many correlations between self-modifying code and our
<br>
biological DNA programming, and I do faintly recall reading about it in the
<br>
canonical SAI/CFAI/xAI papers. From what I understand about WebMind, the
<br>
intelligence architecture was almost finished, then it was going to be
<br>
trained and re-create itself as version 2.0 at some stage. Instead of
<br>
re-writing itself completely (or even whole components at the component
<br>
level), why not continuously modify itself at a sub-component level?
<br>
<p>Even if we don't understand how it works now, we can eventually ask it to
<br>
decompile (or super-compile) itself into a human/programmer readable
<br>
language for our benefit.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
