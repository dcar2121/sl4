&nbsp;Responding to several emails on this subject. Sorry about the length.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From: &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=Re:%20Sysop%20hacking">ben@goertzel.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be fun to talk about, but this sort of post-Singularity stuff is *way*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond our capability to project or comprehend with any reasonable degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidence
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I'm more worried about the transition period.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Could someone hack into a Sysop?&quot; The only answer I have is &quot;No, because if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its design were so vulnerable a Friendly SI would never implement it.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;We're progressing straight to perfection, with no stops along the way?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that this is a valid answer, but such ontological responses are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very satisfying to the reader or the writer.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't see the people we're dealing with today (including the entire
<br>
spectrum from spammers and crackers through career criminals, mobsters and
<br>
terrorists) going away any time soon.  I assume some will still be around to
<br>
upload, and not necessarily to the same Sysop you decide to visit.  If only a
<br>
few hundred thousand upload (or duplicate themselves), and they continue to
<br>
work semi-cooperatively, who knows what they might accomplish as they advance
<br>
along their own progress spike?  Unless there's something inherently
<br>
enlightening and unifying about advancement?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I'm wondering is if anyone has any ideas about how a Sysop might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supremely well protected from hacking.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Only infinite resources would allow the Sysop to keep his computing base/
<br>
resources/software/hardware/AI code base up to date with the very latest tech.
<br>
There will be occasional lapses where the &quot;State of the Art&quot; and the &quot;State
<br>
you're living in&quot; aren't the same.  You only need to be cracked once.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My background isn't technical enough to give any real-life examples besides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;physical separation&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Physical separation increases knowledge propagation delays.  Unless you are
<br>
/the/a parallel/ source of all new knowledge?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could something as ubiquitous as a Sysop realistically do this?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I think planning for survivability will be more fruitful.  Was it Alan Grimes
<br>
that was talking about liberty?  Something he wrote exposed the thoughts I had
<br>
lurking.  We're not going to be able to give up our responsibilities and cares
<br>
to some super computer.  Each of us (or at least enough up to some threshold)
<br>
has to play a part, and contribute time, diligence, and resources to
<br>
maintaining our safety - always.  The Sysop I picture is just another tool I/we
<br>
use to get there - but it's not the &quot;there&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; it would be logical for the Sysop to physically distribute minds in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that a physical attack would require destroying the universe to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone out completely.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;A large part of information warfare deals just with getting read-access to
<br>
data, with or without the data holder knowing.  You don't have to manipulate or
<br>
destroy the data to create havoc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: &quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20Sysop%20hacking">sentience@pobox.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's also possible that given a superintelligent programmer there are just no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistakes left to exploit,
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Even with near-infinite intelligence, not everything will be deduced ahead of
<br>
time.  There will still be a lot of exploring of the state-space of technology
<br>
and its implementation.  What if you discover that for the last /10 seconds/1
<br>
Myear/ you've been merely climbing the mole-hill instead of the mountain?  In a
<br>
second you could be left in the dust.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From: Gordon Worley &lt;<a href="mailto:redbird@rbisland.cx?Subject=Re:%20Sysop%20hacking">redbird@rbisland.cx</a>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... This will not work, though, because if the Sysop is to do ver job ve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have to, in theory, protect SIs of greater intelligence as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those lower intelligence from those same attacks.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This plays on one of my fears - that either the Sysop is always significantly
<br>
greater than everyone else, or else everyone is somehow limited such that they
<br>
are always less than the Sysop.
<br>
&nbsp;Future Me: &quot;I think I'm onto a break-through in remote matter manipulation....&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;Sysop: That would allow anyone to reprogram me and compromise the system.
<br>
&quot;Your access to the research lab is terminated. Please return to the
<br>
playground.  Your emigration visa to the Hackers-R-US BBS is denied.  I've also
<br>
set your information export quota to zero Pbytes/sec. I'll let you know when
<br>
I've discovered a defense.  Until then, everyone's CPU allotment is cut to 10%
<br>
while I search.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Until I can find a solution, we are accelerating at MAX perpendicular to the
<br>
galactic plane, to minimize our intersection with hostile light-cones.&quot;
