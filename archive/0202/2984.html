</em><br>
<p><p>Uh, sorry, I find these comments rather a bit arrogant, irrespective of what I
<br>
think of Microsoft research, Flare specification, or this particular
<br>
journalist's opinion. If I was more technically knowledgable about the
<br>
development and history of C, C++, VB and Java, and the plethora of procedural,
<br>
object-oriented, declarative, functional, annotative, etc. high level languages,
<br>
I am positive that Flare wouldn't be that much of an innovation in software
<br>
development tools to be considered something worth plaguerizing by the evil
<br>
empire of Microsoft, Sun, IBM, or anyone else.
<br>
<p>IMHO, the only thing &quot;skinnable&quot; about Flare is that its eXtensibility comes
<br>
from the X in XML. There are other ways and other languages that have this
<br>
ability already. There are competitions for obscure programming languages, or
<br>
Rapid Application Development (RAD) environments, that could quite easily
<br>
conform to the goals of Flare. Let's not forget the IDE, so that developers can
<br>
model, write, test, debug, etc. in this supposedly useful language (Eclipse or
<br>
NetBeans plugins come immediately to mind if you want to start somewhere).
<br>
<p>The reason why software sucks is because the biggest crime in Software
<br>
Engineering, again IMHO, is everyone tries to re-implement the wheel time and
<br>
time again. The .net framework with its CLR and more predominantly J2EE with its
<br>
JVM just happen to be the latest development framework technologies that are
<br>
popular now. These frameworks allow developers to write better object-oriented
<br>
code, because developers find it easier to be oriented by programming complex
<br>
systems with objects, so to speak. Flare may be object-oriented too, but the
<br>
runtime environment is just as critical as the application code. Maybe Flare# or
<br>
JFlare has potential as a human programmable language, but Flare as I understand
<br>
it is very weak. If I am misunderstanding the scope of Flare and it does indeed
<br>
incorporate a runtime system, then I think it will still be a futile project if
<br>
you compare it to a project like Mono, the open source attempt at implementing
<br>
.NET framework, which is slowly but surely copying .NET, with I assume more
<br>
people working on it than Flare.
<br>
<p>Personally, I think .NET (and hence C#) has great potential to be even better
<br>
than the &quot;traditional&quot; J2EE and Java system. +1 for Microsoft for at least
<br>
submitting the C# language to a standards organization like the ECMA.
<br>
<p>I find it highly implausible that Microsoft would find features to steal from
<br>
Flare rather than the multitude of languages that have existed for a very long
<br>
time. Sincerely, good luck with Flare, but if I was in charge, I would be
<br>
focusing my efforts elsewhere.
<br>
<p>cheers,
