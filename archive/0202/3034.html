<p>I am afraid that his classes are not based on such
<br>
theoretical intuititon. If they would, perhapse  he would
<br>
have made more thoughts about whether they
<br>
are distinct at all - the first thoughts of a theorist.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My most important point of critics is that he
<br>
(subconsciously or not - I don't know) makes
<br>
the impression that he has some theoretical
<br>
justification for it. I am basically quite sceptical,
<br>
so I don't fall for it, but people having less
<br>
background knowledge, would take this implicit
<br>
message for granted.
<br>
<p>I may be wrong, but I would guess, that his statements
<br>
are rooted in a purely experimental base, They are
<br>
the manifestation of considerations put it into a plausible,
<br>
but very  special architecture completely disregarding
<br>
any theoretical background.
<br>
<p>I don't crititicize his work done as an &quot;experimental
<br>
mathematician.&quot;, I think, there are chances that one
<br>
constructs something great on minimal theoretical
<br>
knowledge. The cathedrals were built
<br>
without knowing the laws of statics, also.
