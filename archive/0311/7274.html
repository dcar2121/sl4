<p><p>The amount of parallelism we can manage depends greatly on the nature of
<br>
the parallelism.  Our hardware doesn't do it because our algorithm
<br>
models have limited use for it.  Again, most of our parallelism is the
<br>
low ROI kind, which gives limited economic incentive to bother with it.

</em><br>
<p><p>A point that is worth making (again), is that much of our mathematics
<br>
surrounding computational theory is premised, at one or more levels, on
<br>
the UTM model.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this, except
<br>
that as a model, UTMs are only useful in mathematics. Many computational
<br>
theorems that are inclusive of &quot;universal&quot; (i.e. infinite) machines look
<br>
different in important ways when constrained to the purely finite state
<br>
case from the ground up.  A lot of computational theory is fairly loose
<br>
and undefinitive precisely because it has to include the edge case of
<br>
infinite machines, something which does not exist for real engineering
<br>
purposes.
<br>
<p>I first noticed the importance of this a several years ago when I
<br>
inadvertently derived a useful theorem that didn't match an existing
<br>
equivalent theorem in a &quot;biblical&quot; math text.  The version I generated
<br>
was much more useful -- it made some additional assertions that the
<br>
&quot;standard&quot; version did not -- so I attempted to rectify it and see why
<br>
mine was different.  It turned out that the sole difference was that my
<br>
math was explicitly constrained to purely finite cases.  Not &quot;universal&quot;
<br>
in the mathematical sense, but universal for real-world purposes and
<br>
more useful as well.
<br>
<p>Since then, I have become very cognizant that a great many of the things
<br>
most people believe (culturally, socially, politically, scientifically)
<br>
are based on invalid assumptions (implicit infinities, mathematical edge
<br>
cases, etc) for application in the real world.  Noticing the
<br>
pervasiveness of these kinds of fallacies and unnoticed limitations even
<br>
among the &quot;enlightened&quot; thinkers has significantly altered my views on
<br>
many things over last few years.  I've had to re-reason many things.
