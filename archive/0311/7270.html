<p><em>&gt; We've done much more work on the parallel architectures path than

</em><br>
<p>Computer science is now quite firmly in an established discipline 
<br>
(read: rigor mortis) mode. 
<br>
Nevermind the founders, early adopters have been littering the obits,
<br>
and each subsequent generation seems to be bound on the task of
<br>
rediscovering the wheel, only as a polygon. No new language has
<br>
been able to transcend concepts pioneered in Lisp, the second oldest
<br>
language after Fortran. The (already fading) XML hype is just badly reinvented SEXPRs
<br>
in disguise. This is so pathetic, words fail me.
<br>
<p>It is a bit like a Cambrian explosion being over, don't you agree?
<br>
The crazy experimentation mode (and funds for R&amp;D) are over, and
<br>
the discipline has just stagnated. Is it just me, or doesn't CS
<br>
smell a lot like a crypt full of mummies? Perhaps it's time to
<br>
torch the place, and move on to something completely different.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Huge amounts of effort was expended on trying to produce new, parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradigms for computation to take advantage of massively parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware. Hundreds of radical new designs were worked on, with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorts of innovative ideas -- everything from moving to smart memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and dumb computation to data flow architectures to everything else you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can imagine.
</em><br>
<p>I remember. I was there, if only as an interested layman observer.
<br>
It is hard to remain optimistic on the backdrop of so many lost hopes.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The result of all of it was that you could produce some interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architectures for specific computational tasks, but producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that had general programming utility was damn hard. We just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know how to do it well.
</em><br>
<p>My point precisely. Our high-level architecture has a huge
<br>
perception/performance deficit as far as parallelism is concerned.
<br>
We can't do it, because we just can't. Can alternative entities (AIs, aliens)
<br>
debug 10^6 concurrent threads in the same manner as we can 2-3?
<br>
Is this at all possible, or is all massive parallelism unattainable
<br>
but by algorithms driven stochastically from the roots up? I wish we knew.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think the problem was hardware. I think the problem is that
</em><br>
<p>Initial bits were dumb. We were stuck with the notion &quot;smart central
<br>
processing unit&quot; vs &quot;dumb storage, a pile of bits&quot; even after we
<br>
got bits being represented in the same structures as logic gates.
<br>
It was a habitual bias we didn't even realize we had, because we're
<br>
so used to the human processor sequentially hacking away at the
<br>
dumb universe metaphor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; you can show that some cellular automaton is Turing Equivalent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massively parallel, but actually making it do useful work requires
</em><br>
<p>The Turing machine is a nice hardware for a sequential-mind gedanken
<br>
theorists, but as blueprint for a physical computer it sucks mossy
<br>
rocks. People still don't realize that in this universe a sequential
<br>
machine simply can't do most task by virtue of the universe being over,
<br>
not to mention current realtime requirements, which are on ms..us scale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; techniques we don't understand. By contrast, the Von Neumann style lent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself very easily to real world work.
</em><br>
<p>Becase we seem to see the world as a sequence of events. We can't
<br>
jump outside of our skins.
