<em>&gt; Nevermind the founders, early adopters have been littering the obits,

</em><br>
<p>Is it? I'm not sure why it would be otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the point of view of societal changes and applications, computers

are in their infancy. However, as a scientific and mathematical
<br>
discipline, we've fairly extensively explored the space. There
<br>
continue to be dark corners, but you can't expect to have a field like
<br>
this continue to be equally fertile for genuinely new ideas forever,
<br>
can you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a bit like a Cambrian explosion being over, don't you agree?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The crazy experimentation mode (and funds for R&amp;D) are over, and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; smell a lot like a crypt full of mummies? Perhaps it's time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torch the place, and move on to something completely different.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm personally doing that in so far as I'm much more interested
<br>
in other fields of study right now. It is a big universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Huge amounts of effort was expended on trying to produce new, parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; paradigms for computation to take advantage of massively parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hardware. Hundreds of radical new designs were worked on, with all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sorts of innovative ideas -- everything from moving to smart memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and dumb computation to data flow architectures to everything else you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can imagine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember. I was there, if only as an interested layman observer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is hard to remain optimistic on the backdrop of so many lost hopes.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why this is a cause either for optimism or pessimism. One
<br>
tries experiments, some work and some do not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The result of all of it was that you could produce some interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; architectures for specific computational tasks, but producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; something that had general programming utility was damn hard. We just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't know how to do it well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point precisely. Our high-level architecture has a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception/performance deficit as far as parallelism is concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can't do it, because we just can't. Can alternative entities (AIs, aliens)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debug 10^6 concurrent threads in the same manner as we can 2-3?
</em><br>
<p>I suspect that once we've gone transhuman and are no longer
<br>
constrained by our existing brain capacities, we'll be able to deal
<br>
with more complexity -- but remember, in certain areas like threading
<br>
some forms of complexity grow exponentially, and the utility of the
<br>
mechanisms is not as high as one might naively expect. It was only
<br>
about eight years ago that I understood that event driven systems are
<br>
much much cleaner, more efficient, and nicer to work with than
<br>
threaded systems....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is this at all possible, or is all massive parallelism unattainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but by algorithms driven stochastically from the roots up? I wish we knew.
</em><br>
<p>We'll find out eventually. ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I don't think the problem was hardware. I think the problem is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initial bits were dumb. We were stuck with the notion &quot;smart central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing unit&quot; vs &quot;dumb storage, a pile of bits&quot; even after we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got bits being represented in the same structures as logic gates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It was a habitual bias we didn't even realize we had, because we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so used to the human processor sequentially hacking away at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dumb universe metaphor.
</em><br>
<p>But people have tried playing with smart memories a lot during the
<br>
parallel processing research of the 80s, and they didn't get very far
<br>
with it. Various kinds of CAMs are in fact still in use -- most
<br>
routers are filled with content addressable memories -- but for the
<br>
most part the experiments ended with failures of various sorts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; techniques we don't understand. By contrast, the Von Neumann style lent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; itself very easily to real world work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Becase we seem to see the world as a sequence of events. We can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jump outside of our skins.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps part of it is human psychology, perhaps part of it is that it
<br>
is legitimately hard to design things that don't follow that
<br>
paradigm.
<br>
<p>Either way, though, I'm not going to call what we've done a
<br>
failure. Look around you. The very machine you're communicating with
<br>
-- and the vast global network it is attached to -- can hardly be
<br>
called a failure.
