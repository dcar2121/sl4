</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result to not ignore the physical layer.
</em><br>
<p>Since when is there any evidence that Moore's Law is
<br>
petering out? people have been claiming that for
<br>
fifteen years and chips continue to grow faster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; requires either specialized types of hardware, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely. 
</em><br>
<p>Since when does AI require specialized hardware? Fast
<br>
hardware, quite possibly, but specialized hardware?
<br>
Fast hardware can be obtained by linking slow hardware
<br>
together. Specialized hardware requires a redesign of
<br>
the chip. We might need the former, but why would we
<br>
need the latter?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thorough knowledge of the hardware it is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't talking about it in the sense of &quot;which chip
<br>
you are running it on&quot;. You need to know if it's on a
<br>
PC-type computer or a Mac-type computer, but there is
<br>
no need to program in binary or even assembly code,
<br>
which requires a lot of knowledge of the chip
<br>
architecture. High-level languages will work just as
<br>
well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; programmed on, there is no need to waste time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If both of your premises weren't wrong, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be agreeing with your conclusion. 
</em><br>
<p>Please explain how my premises are wrong. AI is
<br>
obviously harder and has more things on the line than
<br>
a conventional programming project, but why can't it
<br>
be done on regular hardware? And why can't it be done
<br>
in a high-level language that doesn't require a lot of
<br>
knowledge of the chip?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; discussing it. If it isn't broken, don't fix it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; don't spend valuable time discussing it. Quote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Staring into the Singularity- &quot;Ever since the late
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 90's, the Singularity has been only a problem of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm completely immune to quotes. As long as you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show me that hardware is not a problem, and more and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better hardware isn't a very powerful tool to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumvent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this software (the separation between software and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware is a yet another sterile meme of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we started this discussion with) you could be as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well quoting from Mao's Little Red Book.
</em><br>
<p>You can have to most powerful chip on the planet, but
<br>
you need software to run it on, and that's the tricky
<br>
part. You can get faster computers by stringing slower
<br>
computers together, but you can't get better programs
<br>
by stringing bad programs together. I agree that
<br>
better hardware makes the software problems easier,
<br>
but even incredibly simple scenarios like software
<br>
processes that were mutated by another
<br>
low-intelligence process and selected for their
<br>
ability to play chess require a good deal of software
<br>
design. And that scenario would probably end with an
<br>
AI that wants to demolish the solar system to make
<br>
more room for hardware to play chess better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; software.&quot; The hardware companies can handle the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem of making fast chips- but we need the code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, they can't. That's the whole point of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Johnny can't make fast chips, and if you want AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand why.
</em><br>
<p>Even if modern PCs are too slow for AI, you can use a
<br>
supercomputer or distributed computing (or lots of
<br>
PC's working parallelly in some warehouse.) And even
<br>
if that doesn't work, chips are getting faster.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; make the chips become a Friendly Seed AI. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where SIAI comes in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not feeling like joining the F issue before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware and the software part isn't addressed.
</em><br>
<p>Even Eurisko shouldn't have been done without a
<br>
coherent theory of Friendliness. When you're planning
<br>
on making a being that has the potential to blow up
<br>
the planet, you don't want to take any unnecessary
<br>
risks by something as easily remedied as putting the
<br>
AI before the Friendliness theory.
<br>

<em>&gt; Unless, of course, that's off-topic for this list.
