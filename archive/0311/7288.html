<em>&gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yesterday I was chatting with someone in private about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intel and how it has been involved with the militia (as did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IBM) and also about how they continually tried to exclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Japanese from participating in chip technologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This bothers me a lot because we need to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that technology is not separate from politics and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who think that this is irrelevant are probably beneficiaries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of such questionable dealings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which doesn't mean that I'm the final arbitar of what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right or wrong, but I think more discussion of this may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help, rather than letting innuedo trail off in random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directions and failing to communicate effectively.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also I asked a question about fault tolerance in P4
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which was purely technical. If we were to scale down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to molecular electronics operating in room temperature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault tolerance is quite essential.
</em><br>
<p>I read recently via slashdot an interview with a fellow at 
<br>
Intel who was mostly concerned with classifying
<br>
on board the different qualities of circuit. That future 
<br>
hasn't arrived so I suppose the P4 of today will throw 
<br>
errors and blue screens when encountering a failed transistor.
<br>
<p>I found it again for you here.

<br>
prostoalex writes &quot;The August issue of Intel Developer 
<br>
Update has an interview with Shekhar Borkar, Intel Fellow 
<br>
and Director of Circuit Research at Intel Corp. talking 
<br>
about the future of microprocessor design and what goes on 
<br>
inside Intel Labs. Borkar tells why we need even faster 
<br>
processors and how probability will make its way into future 
<br>
chip designs - &quot;It's like the shift from Newtonian mechanics 
<br>
to quantum mechanics. We will shift from the deterministic 
<br>
designs of today to probabilistic and statistical designs of 
<br>
the future.&quot;&quot;
<br>
<p>He goes on... &quot;Today, if you look at two transistors sitting 
<br>
side by side on the chip, they vary a little, but the 
<br>
difference is not significant. In the future, the 
<br>
transistors side by side will have a lot of variation. We 
<br>
are pushing the limits again, so it's all exponential. And 
<br>
there is another fundamental physical effect coming in. The 
<br>
transistors are becoming so small that the atoms and 
<br>
molecules that used to look like a continuum now look like 
<br>
discretes.
<br>
<p>As a result, we need to fundamentally change how we use 
<br>
these transistors. We have to design the circuit in such a 
<br>
way that it's tolerant of variations. It's like the shift 
<br>
from Newtonian mechanics to quantum mechanics. We will shift 
<br>
from the deterministic designs of today to probabilistic and 
<br>
statistical designs of the future.
<br>
<p>So we now say, &quot;If I do this in the design, the transistors 
<br>
and therefore the chip will perform in this way.&quot; In the 
<br>
future, we will say, &quot;If I design with this logic depth or 
<br>
this transistor size, I will increase the probability that a 
<br>
given chip will perform in this way.&quot; It's pretty wild. &quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Government' doesn't necessarily need to be a bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing. Capitalism is a form of meritocracy which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been quite successful in organizing large-scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic activities and division of labor. Unless we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find better ways to replace these things they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely to change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; YKY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
It bothers me that everybody gets ridiculed who looks for 
<br>
better ways. Just look at the exquisite world view of the 
<br>
slashdotters and their open source + nano technology utopia.
<br>
<p>Not that I think Marshall Brain is a future novelist but he 
<br>
uses the guise to get across a better way. You'll have to 
<br>
read all the way to chapter eight to get to the guts of his 
<br>
economic manifesto called &quot;The Australia Project&quot;. Here's 
<br>
his free online book called Manna, which I agree with 
<br>
because everything in my software will converge with his 
<br>
concept of the Vertabrane.
<br>
<p><a href="http://marshallbrain.com/manna8.htm">http://marshallbrain.com/manna8.htm</a> -
<br>
<p>[[my excerpt from Chapter 8]] ...  One thing I did think 
<br>
about more and more was the security of this whole system. 
<br>
Computers had been plagued with bugs and viruses since the 
<br>
beginning, but the Australia Project seemed to suffer from 
<br>
none of these problems. One day I asked Linda about it.
<br>
<p>&quot;What's to stop someone from taking over the system and 
<br>
turning us into an army of zombies?&quot; I asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm no engineer,&quot; Linda said, &quot;But here's the best 
<br>
explanation I've heard. Why can't someone take over your brain?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Why has no one ever been able to take over billions of 
<br>
human brains and create an army of zombies that way?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Well, it's inside of me. How would they take it over?&quot; I 
<br>
replied.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why can't they just upload a program into your brain, and 
<br>
that program takes over your brain and turns you into a 
<br>
zombie a minute later? Why does that never happen?&quot; She asked.
<br>
<p>&quot;Because there is no way to 'upload' a program into my 
<br>
brain. And my brain does not execute programs anyway. It is 
<br>
not a computer.&quot; I replied.
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; She said. &quot;[[I mostly agree]]Everything you learn 
<br>
comes in through your eyes and ears. It passes through your 
<br>
conscious mind one piece at a time, and your conscious mind 
<br>
evaluates it. Then your conscious mind 'executes' the things 
<br>
you learn consciously, thinking about each one. If someone 
<br>
were to try to teach you to cut off your own arm, your 
<br>
conscious mind would reject that as ridiculous when the 
<br>
lesson came in, and your brain would certainly never cause 
<br>
you to cut off your arm except in the most extreme 
<br>
situations. The Vertabrane system is operating in the same 
<br>
way. It is learning things, not running programs. It acts 
<br>
consciously rather than being 'programmed', and it has a far 
<br>
more rigid moral code than most human beings do. The 
<br>
Vertebrane system never blindly 'executes' a program, so it 
<br>
cannot be taken over. That's true of all of the robots here. 
<br>
The Australia Project would have collapsed long ago if this 
<br>
were just a bunch of computers blindly executing code that 
<br>
humans had written. That is how things were in the 
<br>
beginning, [[of]] course, but we advanced beyond it fairly 
<br>
quickly.&quot;
