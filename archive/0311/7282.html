Being new to the list and this is my first post, please 
<br>
don't tread on me. Most of your names are recognized from my 
<br>
experience seven years ago when I was on the extropy list. 
<br>
Let's just say that I've been busy developing my application.
<br>
<p>I read what Jaron Lanier had to say and was expecting to see 
<br>
the glaringly obvious but I was dumbfounded that it wasn't 
<br>
stated. So I will do it even though some of you will think 
<br>
I'm being tactless.
<br>
<p>My view is that Governments are like the little thing on top 
<br>
of the pressure cooker. The pressure in this discussion is 
<br>
none other than complexity and they let off steam in the 
<br>
form of chaos. In governmental terms this chaos is war
<br>
<p>My keyboard just jammed so I'll be brief. People like 
<br>
Stafford Beer knew of this chaos first hand and would have 
<br>
been closest to breaking through the complexity barrier. Who 
<br>
knows where we would have been today if his cybernetic 
<br>
revolution wasn't crushed by the CIA when they planned to 
<br>
murder Chile's Salvador Allende back in 1973. It is also my 
<br>
view that the mistakes were made hundreds of years earlier 
<br>
when Capitalism scarred human nature into this condition. 
<br>
Not Egyptian mathematics but Capitalism and the early 
<br>
Christian concepts of zero, and how the debit and credit 
<br>
system evolved into our present monetary systems,  is what 
<br>
did us in. Not respecting zero as the inverse of infinity is 
<br>
what stops us. In their naivety, what those computer 
<br>
pioneers didn't get right was how to cope with the frailty 
<br>
and fear inherent in human nature; - spam, FUD, etc.
<br>
<p>But cope I do until they will take this keyboard from me and 
<br>
then my mind will turn to mush.
