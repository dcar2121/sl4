<em>&gt;Being new to the list and this is my first post, please 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't tread on me. Most of your names are recognized from my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience seven years ago when I was on the extropy list. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let's just say that I've been busy developing my application.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I read what Jaron Lanier had to say and was expecting to see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the glaringly obvious but I was dumbfounded that it wasn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stated. So I will do it even though some of you will think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm being tactless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My view is that Governments are like the little thing on top 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the pressure cooker. The pressure in this discussion is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;none other than complexity and they let off steam in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;form of chaos. In governmental terms this chaos is war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My keyboard just jammed so I'll be brief. People like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stafford Beer knew of this chaos first hand and would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been closest to breaking through the complexity barrier. Who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knows where we would have been today if his cybernetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolution wasn't crushed by the CIA when they planned to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;murder Chile's Salvador Allende back in 1973. It is also my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view that the mistakes were made hundreds of years earlier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when Capitalism scarred human nature into this condition. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not Egyptian mathematics but Capitalism and the early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Christian concepts of zero, and how the debit and credit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system evolved into our present monetary systems,  is what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did us in. Not respecting zero as the inverse of infinity is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what stops us. In their naivety, what those computer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pioneers didn't get right was how to cope with the frailty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and fear inherent in human nature; - spam, FUD, etc.

<p>Hi,
<br>
<p>Yesterday I was chatting with someone in private about
<br>
Intel and how it has been involved with the militia (as did
<br>
IBM) and also about how they continually tried to exclude
<br>
the Japanese from participating in chip technologies.
<br>
This bothers me a lot because we need to understand
<br>
that technology is not separate from politics and those
<br>
who think that this is irrelevant are probably beneficiaries
<br>
of such questionable dealings.
<br>
<p>Which doesn't mean that I'm the final arbitar of what is
<br>
right or wrong, but I think more discussion of this may
<br>
help, rather than letting innuedo trail off in random
<br>
directions and failing to communicate effectively.
<br>
<p>Also I asked a question about fault tolerance in P4
<br>
which was purely technical. If we were to scale down
<br>
to molecular electronics operating in room temperature,
<br>
fault tolerance is quite essential.
<br>
<p>'Government' doesn't necessarily need to be a bad
<br>
thing. Capitalism is a form of meritocracy which has
<br>
been quite successful in organizing large-scale
<br>
economic activities and division of labor. Unless we
<br>
find better ways to replace these things they are
<br>
unlikely to change.
<br>
<p>YKY
