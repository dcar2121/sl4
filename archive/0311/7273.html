<p><p>A careful distinction has to be made here, and there is a shortage of

appropriate terminology.
<br>
<p>&quot;Parallel&quot; is a term generally used to denote partitioning a machine
<br>
(&quot;algorithm&quot;) into multiple machines of the same information theoretic
<br>
order. Since this is machine equivalent to &quot;serial&quot; and cheaply
<br>
reducible as such for all intents and purposes, I do not view this as an
<br>
important theoretical distinction, though it does have pragmatic
<br>
ramifications.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, &quot;parallel&quot; could be used to denote partitioning a machine
<br>
*by* information theoretic order.  This second type of parallelism is
<br>
not tractably reducible to the first type of parallelism (only in
<br>
mathematics-land is it reducible), nor does it lend itself well to the
<br>
type of computing hardware that we can build.
<br>
<p>No conception of this second kind of parallelism is possible in a
<br>
Shannon-esque model of computation, and algorithm spaces that scale well
<br>
using this second kind of parallelism can be extremely expensive using
<br>
an equivalent Shannon model. By the time reasonable conceptions of this
<br>
second kind of parallelism emerged in the post-Kolmogorov theoretical
<br>
environment, the fact that decades had already passed and that we still
<br>
can't build computational machinery that handles this natively for all
<br>
practical purposes has limited interest in it. One can simulate such
<br>
machinery on normal silicon but it is very memory expensive and exhibits
<br>
a lot of fine-grained parallelism.
<br>
<p>Computer science as taught today still uses a model of the machine that
<br>
is essentially Shannon-esque, and it is the only model that our
<br>
programming languages address well. (In an abstract machine model sense,
<br>
all languages are roughly equivalent; they are targeted to the same
<br>
implementation concept of a computational machine.)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is also interesting to observe how vogues come and go, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how evolutionary lemmings deserted the field in droves when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field stalled due to hardware limitations and inability to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one has to evolve evolvable systems first, as brittleware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't take kindly to have its bits mutated under its feet.
</em><br>
<p><p>Brittleness is related to the issue I mention above, and is a direct
<br>
consequence of using machines with purely axiomatic behaviors.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Have you had a chance to write up your views?
</em><br>
<p><p>I'm working on a reference website that covers a broad range of
<br>
theoretical and pragmatic issues related to these topics at large. 
<br>
Rather than hastily writing the same sloppy explanations for somewhat
<br>
complicated theoretical subjects for the nth time, I've been working on
<br>
well-written and well-organized body of work that covers these topics in
<br>
detail with lots of examples, cross-referencing, and elucidation. 
<br>
Mostly so that I can point people to a link instead of writing about
<br>
it.  I will post it to the appropriate places when I put it on the web.
