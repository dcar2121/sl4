<p>
I read the entirety of Pei Wang's NARS 3.0 thesis this weekend (all 181
<br>
pages of it); I've glanced over small bits and pieces in the past, but never
<br>
taken time to understand it in detail.  Ben (Goertzel) has stated more than
<br>
once that many of my ideas appear closely aligned with Pei's, something it I
<br>
can now state with certainty is more than just apparent, and many of the
<br>
theoretical similarities at that level explain why I've been in general
<br>
agreement with Pei on matters that almost no one else seemed to &quot;get&quot; (from
<br>
my perspective) in past discussions on the lists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a formal theory standpoint, I find NARS to be very, very good, among
</em><br>
the best I've ever read.  Most of my quibbles and questions occur for me at
<br>
the implementation and representation level, which is where my general
<br>
strengths are anyway.  For example, I am not entirely sold on the &quot;urgency&quot;
<br>
model.  It seems to me that such things can be dealt with implicitly in the
<br>
representation and implementation if the system is non-axiomatic.  I would
<br>
argue similar minor points elsewhere, but since implementation and
<br>
representation is only covered obliquely this is not a criticism of the
<br>
underlying theory.
<br>
<p>It is well worth the read (and quicker than the 181 pages implies) if you
<br>
haven't been exposed to this general model of AGI.  I would still assert
<br>
that representation (and by extension, implementation) is the other half of
<br>
the problem, but NARS is a pretty fine description of the first half even
<br>
with my quibbles.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
