<em>&gt; &gt; I think it makes considerable sense, but I suspect that if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I were to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; give my honest opinion of why speculation was more tolerated than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; concrete discussion of computer architecture I'd become persona non

<em>&gt; *Sigh*. Although I am the appointed List Sniper, the sniping I do

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Several red flags went up at once in the Jaron Lanier thread, and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became sufficiently annoyed to take action. Since several people have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brought up valid concerns over my judgment, I have reconsidered and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declare that the discussion of architectures is semi-tolerated again, 
</em><br>

<p>I'd like to pipe in here with a view that Lanier's rambling should not
<br>
be under-rated in content nor should it be under-rated from a semiotic
<br>
standpoint as lacking relevance to SL4 thinking.
<br>
<p>If you read papers on the progress of AI you find people like Rodney
<br>
Brooks saying that they are on the lookout for some youngster to come
<br>
along and set them all straight on what we cannot see. AI is in the very
<br>
strange position of being claimed a great success and a total failure at
<br>
the same time. The last thing they all talk about in summary papers is
<br>
how mysterious and hard subjective experience is and how unable we still
<br>
are to clearly state its relevance to intelligence. The mystery of the
<br>
quale. Oh my, computer science has discovered actual physical reality
<br>
and cognitive science!
<br>
<p>Next, neuroscience: summary papers outline the mystery of the quale,
<br>
walk empirical circles all about them and decry their own impotence in
<br>
uncovering their source. Stare down the microscope, make reems of fMRIs,
<br>
they see nothing but fermionic matter and it does this amazing thing
<br>
called 'the what it is like experience' and all they can recommend is
<br>
more and more connectionist ratsnests when connectionists themselves say
<br>
'something is missing'. Grossberg has produced a basically complete
<br>
connectionist outline of vision (occipital lobe neural topology). Put it
<br>
in silicon...will the silicon have a visual experience? No-one can say.
<br>
Why not?
<br>
<p>Philosophers walk the solution landscape and have now institutionalised
<br>
the quale as 'the hard problem'. Mysterians and panpsychists and
<br>
functionalists and any number of other Xists wander around the
<br>
intractibility of this mystery. The trail is several thousand years old.
<br>
Forests of trees have been slain documenting it. In &quot;Encyclopedia of
<br>
Cognitive Science&quot;, 2003 (A$2000.00 eeek!) we have Ned Blockage and the
<br>
&quot;no-one has even come close to a plausible theory for qualia&quot; cry
<br>
enshrined like a company policy. Mysterians like Colin McGinn declare
<br>
that we have a fundamental misconception about the nature of matter
<br>
(Galen Strawson's comments on him are worth a read too. And Dennett too
<br>
for that matter)
<br>
<p>Scientific method itself is at a well documented and much discussed
<br>
boundary condition where the thing doing all the observing in a
<br>
classical 3rd person observer culture several hundred years old is
<br>
focussed on itself and found wanting.
<br>
<p>The academic world and the whole evolution of philosophy of science has
<br>
contrived to draw our view of the universe into a particular place and
<br>
from that place the solution to the mystery (which is in the end what
<br>
Lanier is really talking about) is simply not visible.
<br>
<p>Lanier's proposal is, if I understand him correctly, just as wrong as
<br>
whatever he criticises. Lot's of parallel crap is just a whole bunch
<br>
more crap than serial crap. Parallel in 2D, 3D, 4D, crap is still crap.
<br>
A model of a thing is not a thing! When a 'thing' is split into Program,
<br>
Data and processor substrate and the only place that any remnant
<br>
ontology exists is in the mind of the programmer, that 'thing' is gone
<br>
from the universe.  I have written reams in support of this type of
<br>
argument against the era of the modellers, which started in earnest,
<br>
IMO, with Bertrand Russel early last century and must end. I believe
<br>
that the principle reason we are in the state we are in is the same
<br>
basic category as the &quot;why does a dog lick it's privates...because it
<br>
can&quot; joke. That's about as blunt as I can put it. We got our materials
<br>
science under control just enough to make piles of algorithm (state
<br>
machine) theory testable and we just kept going because we could and it
<br>
did wondrous things to industry. It's just not the path to intelligent
<br>
matter: this is the signs I see when I see Laniers and their ilk.
<br>
<p>The real value of what Lanier is saying is that he is &quot;poking the bear&quot;.
<br>
We need more people to gnaw away at conventional 'wizdom' and for it to
<br>
become more culturally tolerable to propose new ways of looking at
<br>
things. Not necessarily new things but simply the same things in new
<br>
ways. 
<br>
<p>There's another blockage as well. Einstein said &quot;If you haven't been a
<br>
wizkid by 30 you'll never do it, das ist kaput, jah?&quot; or something like
<br>
that. Sorry Albert. You get the idea. The stuff of Brooks' yearn
<br>
(above). Lanier describes a brief magic moment in comp sci where the
<br>
whole science could reside in one head. The last vestige of the age of
<br>
the generalists blinked out sometime in the mid 20th century. My point?
<br>
......
<br>
Einstein's magic novel thinking youngster, needed to solve the mystery
<br>
hiding amidst the divisions of 400 years of evolution of scientific
<br>
disciplines, needs to have more than just a foot in, say, 15 disciplines
<br>
.ie. The experience of a veteran. This is the recipe from hell for
<br>
hiding a solution.
<br>
<p>But wait there's more! These are the epistemological steak knives. I
<br>
believe we have evolved not to find the solution. This is something I
<br>
rarely find discussed. Our place in the universe is selected through the
<br>
brutish unthinking experimentalism of the natural world and we may be
<br>
optimally chosen for masking those aspects of the universe generating
<br>
our view of it. If it were a survival advantage for the processes of
<br>
subjective experience to be transparently obvious then it would be just
<br>
that. If it is a survival advantage to obscure the processes and simply
<br>
'be' it then that is what would happen. I believe we are in the latter
<br>
category. 
<br>
<p>So what's the point of it all? My personal view is that the whole idea
<br>
of a 'spike' and everything that this list holds dear is dependent on
<br>
the Laniers of the world and this type of thinking and it should be
<br>
welcomed and nurtured. Is SL4 part of the problem or part of the
<br>
solution? What if the type of computing theory and it's Moore's Law
<br>
driven hardware we have had fed to us for decades is the buggy whip
<br>
solution with a future that has no relevance to the utlimate outcome of
<br>
intelligent matter (this doesn't mean it's not useful! Just that it's
<br>
for a different marketplace).
<br>
<p>I find Lanier pretty unintelligible and tire of him being wheeled out as
<br>
an verbally effulgent wunderkind. Nevertheless I'll read what he says
<br>
and walk the path and ask for more because I need those sleepy people to
<br>
wake up. Dennett and other functionalist/representationalist folks want
<br>
to wish the problem away in spite of legions of contrary punditry. But
<br>
it won't be wished away and we need Lanier-like thinking to break the
<br>
impasse. We need to listen well and not simply dismiss like Dennett did
<br>
on edge.org
<br>
<p>Maybe I should post this to edge...if Steve Grand can blather on why
<br>
can't I? Hmmm. Invite only. Bugger.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>Colin Hales
