Methinks this question hits our  ambiguous, limited notions of 
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; very very hard.
<br>
<p>I'm afraid we don't yet have the conceptual vocabulary needed to comprehend 
<br>
or discuss the parallels between human minds and Gaia-mind.
<br>
<p>Which is not to say we shouldn't try, but we should be very aware of the 
<br>
probability of misleading ourselve by applying human concepts created for 
<br>
describing humans, beyond the scope on which their nuances have been 
<br>
tuned...
<br>
<p>To say &quot;the Gaia conscious being is purposefully working toward the 
<br>
Singularity&quot; may be to export a lot of the human concept of 
<br>
&quot;purposefulness&quot; to a radically non-human domain in a not very appropriate 
<br>
way.
<br>
<p>My own intuition is that, if Gaia is in some sense a mind, it doesn't have 
<br>
fuck-all to do with the encroaching tech Singularity.  I think it is a mind 
<br>
that acts on a very slow scale, and concerns itself with atmospheric 
<br>
chemistry and large-scale patterns of bacteria and plant life much more so 
<br>
than with us humans.   Of course, this is partly  just intuition, though 
<br>
one could also make a fairly rigorous conceptual argument in this 
<br>
direction, if one took the time, I suppose...

Dr. James Lovelock originally proposed the Gaia Hypothesis in 1970, and in
<br>
1979 in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;he published &quot;Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth&quot; wherein he states &quot; Do 
<br>
we
<br>
as a species constitute a Gaian nervous system and a brain which can
<br>
consciously anticipate environmental changes?&quot; [p147]   Most attention has
<br>
been given to the mechanics of the environmental biological feedback 
<br>
systems
<br>
that maintain favorable conditions for life on earth, and almost no
<br>
attention given to the possibility that the human species might be a self
<br>
conscious intelligent being of which we are merely neurons.  Language would
<br>
correspond to neurotransmitters, cultures to lobes, science and history 
<br>
it's
<br>
memory.  Why then isn't it obvious?  It's senses are different from ours,
<br>
and the whole scale problem.  Are your neurons aware of you, or you them?
<br>
What's this to do with the Singularity?  I have been looking for the cause
<br>
of the very consistent progress toward the Singularity despite changing
<br>
human individual circumstances.  This could be it.  If the Gaia conscious
<br>
being is purposefully working toward the Singularity for it's own reasons 
<br>
we
<br>
(individuals) could be in for a big surprise.  When it comes time for
<br>
transcendence who is going to transcend, the individual neurons or the 
<br>
whole
<br>
being?  Are we the ultimate connection machine?
