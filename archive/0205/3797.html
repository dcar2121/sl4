<em>&gt; &gt; human-supplied problems and human-supplied data which required

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would the AI still possess?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you clarify a bit in light of how Cyc handles term names?  In Cyc,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to allow easy renames, the term name is not the identity of the term, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is merely an attribute.  The Cyc term identity is a GUID (128-bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universally unique id) generated by the operating system upon term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation.
</em><br>
<p>In this case, the conceptual experiment I describe above would leave the
<br>
GUID constant and replacing the term name with a randomly generated string. 
<br>
Scrambling the GUIDs is not something that any mind could be expected to
<br>
tolerate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have considered an internal test, what we call the GENSYM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test, that follows your outline:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Take a term, replace its name with a GENSYM (sequentially numbered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningless string), and with its comment hidden, try to identify the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept.  We would also hide the English words that lexify the term.
</em><br>
<p>If you perform this test on only one term at a time, so that you're trying
<br>
to identify an unnamed concept by its relation to other English terms, then
<br>
this may uncover interesting ambiguities in the description language.  If
<br>
Cyc can do it successfully, I think that would show that a Cyc's-eye-view is
<br>
sufficient to say something important about how the strings that humans use
<br>
are related to each other, but it doesn't necessarily show, in itself, that
<br>
a Cyc's-eye-view includes the meaning behind the strings.  Of course, some
<br>
GOFAI philosophers are famous for insisting that the relations between words
<br>
constitute the whole of any one word's meaning, but as you know, I think
<br>
that the perceptual patterns invoked by words also have something to do with
<br>
it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we went beyond this test in Cyc, and replaced all the concept names
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with random strings, but kept the lexical information, then Cyc would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operate fine.  In that the Knowledge Entry and Query tools based on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lexicon would still function.  But if the lexical information were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removed, then you would be unable to easily work with Cyc, but would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to reconstruct a mental model of the concept hierarcy from the top down.
</em><br>
<p>The question is whether the concept hierarchy would be reconstructable at
<br>
all.  I think that if an AI has perceptual concepts, then you would be able
<br>
to rapidly identify individual words in those modalities that the AI
<br>
possessed through the usual method of showing the AI a picture, or running
<br>
the AI through an experience, and then seeing what concept the AI used to
<br>
label it.  I also think that being able to reconstruct a scrambled concept
<br>
net, in this way, is a necessary condition for saying that the AI possesses
<br>
knowledge about the concept behind the word, and not just knowledge about
<br>
how the word is likely to be used in proximity to other words.
<br>
<p>It's been a few years now since I read up on Cyc and CycL, but I remember
<br>
thinking at the time that the reflective portions of the ontology, and
<br>
perhaps things like &quot;verb&quot;, &quot;follows temporally&quot; and &quot;five&quot;, would probably
<br>
be the portions of the concept network that could be reconstructed following
<br>
a global scramble.  I think that from a Cyc's-eye-view, Cyc may know
<br>
something about the grammatical structure of English strings; it knows which
<br>
English strings are synonyms for English strings, and which English strings
<br>
are properties of English strings that describe categories, and which
<br>
English strings denote events that cause events denoted by other English
<br>
strings to occur, and so on, but it doesn't have any idea which events and
<br>
categories the English strings correspond to.
<br>
<p>Thus, I think that for AI in general and Cyc in particular, the global
<br>
scramble thought experiment does say something critical about which concepts
<br>
are anchored independently of their term names.  I will confess to being
<br>
something of a Cyc skeptic because I think that concepts which lack such
<br>
independent anchoring are not real knowledge.  If I had to pick an
<br>
incremental direction for Cyc (as opposed to a complete philosophical
<br>
revision), I think it would be focusing on those Cyc concepts that can be
<br>
grounded in the complex data of Cyc's internals - i.e., teaching Cyc
<br>
perceptual concepts for its own internals.
