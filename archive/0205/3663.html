<em>&gt;&quot;Flaming monkeys will fly out of my butt!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;This is madness!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I can see this is going to take a little more explaining.  Almost
<br>
every major advance in science and technology was discovered/developed near
<br>
simultaneously by more than one researcher, some of whom didn't even know
<br>
about the other's work.  Patent rights are very often awarded based on the
<br>
difference of a few days, sometimes even hours.  Nobel prizes are given to
<br>
multiple recipients frequently due to identical or closely related work by
<br>
independent researchers.  The advance of technology is very regular.  The
<br>
more independent teams working increases the regularity.  The more economic
<br>
potential increases the number of independent teams.  There are very many
<br>
teams working on this problem.  You look around and say, &quot;Where are they?&quot;
<br>
Working in secret, because everyone wants to be first.  Look at the cloning
<br>
of Dolly.  Every authority on biomedical research was surprised to learn
<br>
that the Roslin Institute had cloned Dolly.  They didn't know.  More basic
<br>
science in the fields of computer science, nanotechnology, and AI has come
<br>
out of IBM than any other single place in the world.  IBM has the resources
<br>
to have 50 Novamente projects going on in secret.  You think the Deep Blue
<br>
II beating Garry was a parlor trick?  I happen to be a chess master and I
<br>
can tell you that what happened there was amazing.  It is often sited the
<br>
billions of moves per second that DB was checking, as if it beat Garry by
<br>
pure brute force.  Garry went into that match knowing that you can't beat
<br>
Garry that way.  Garry threw a fit and accused the IBM team of cheating.
<br>
Why?  Because DB thought beyond the board, simulating Garry himself, and
<br>
used a psychological ploy to trick Garry into making a bad move and losing
<br>
the game.  There was much more going on in that program than chess.  And I
<br>
wouldn't count Bill Gates out either.  M$ has it's own AI research
<br>
department which they claim is doing GOFAI.  It probably is doing some of
<br>
that along with the real work.  Nor would I discount Japan, Australia, and
<br>
fifty universities around the world.  Underground AI is BIG BIG BIG!  I like
<br>
Kurzweil's charts because they are data points and not as subject to
<br>
conservativization.  But his formula is purposely biased to the future.  I
<br>
think he knows it's coming in 2005 but doesn't want anyone else to know.
<br>
His prediction of 2005 - 2030 is to make people think it is longer while
<br>
preserving his ability to not be proven wrong.  He wants to a let people
<br>
that would be in favor of the Singularity know that it is coming but he
<br>
doesn't want to alert the enemy how soon.  What would happen in January of
<br>
2005 if CNN, started broadcasting that experts predicted the Singularity in
<br>
four months?  Mass panic.
<br>
<p>Prediction: April 28, 2005.
<br>
<p>Mike.
