<p>
I'm only 35, but I had an aged 8'th grade math teacher who forced us to use
<br>
slide rules.
<br>
<p>He also gave me a D in math that year, because every day I handed my
<br>
homework paper in *folded in half* (it fit better in  my math book that
<br>
way).  He gave zero credit for homework that was folded in half.  I had a
<br>
99.9% test average but I got a D because I had a 0% for homework, although I
<br>
handed in the homework every day.  The reason I didn't have a 100% test
<br>
average is because I got the following question wrong:
<br>
<p>&quot;True or False:  2 = 2.0&quot;
<br>
<p>I said True, he thought False.  I knew what he wanted: he wanted false
<br>
because the accuracies were different.  However i was a young idealist and
<br>
preferred to champion the notion of Equality as I understood it.  I wrote an
<br>
explanation of my answer too, pointing out that equality meant invariance
<br>
under an appropriate set of operations and 2 and 2.0 were invariant under
<br>
pure-mathematical operations (I used less sophisticated language back then,
<br>
to be sure), but he didn't care, he marked me wrong anyway.
<br>
<p>It was at this point that I became 99.99% certain of what I had long
<br>
suspected: the US educational system is almost totally hopeless.
<br>
<p>I became even more convinced of that this semester while teaching an AI
<br>
class (4'th year undergrad, 1'st year grad).  Half the students could barely
<br>
program their way out of a paper bag.  They knew no mathematics and had no
<br>
interest in philosophy or psychology.  They enjoyed writing very simple game
<br>
programs.  I did teach the 4-5 decent students a little bit of interesting
<br>
stuff (Bayes nets, GA's, using GP's to evolve neural nets, etc.).  But the
<br>
main point that struck me was *how little genuine interest* most of the
<br>
class had in AI, or in *anything* apart from getting their degrees and
<br>
getting jobs administering Microsoft Access databases.
<br>
<p>Given an educational system full of teachers who squelch creative individual
<br>
thought, and students who don't want to think at all, it's no wonder we have
<br>
a society full of people who think AGI is a joke, or is 4000 years off...
<br>
<p>But of course it's the human brain that's created this educational
<br>
system....  It's to the credit of the brain that it's conceived the notion
<br>
of an &quot;educational system&quot; at all, of course, but stil...
