<p>Dwight Lodge is no longer with Cycorp. The VC opportunities and IPO market
<br>
are still bad for us.  But the government funding is steady and Darpa has
<br>
an appreciation now for ontologies and our role as a common domain
<br>
vocabulary. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the Cyc database will be a useful resource for an AGI someday, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I personally don't have much optimism that the AI approach being taken at

</em><br>
<p>[details snipped]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, one reaction you might have to this is &quot;Sure, I kind of agree 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction of 'crisp, concise propositions about named concepts' and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'logical inference with predicate logic &amp; bayesian probabilities'.   We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know we're far from a true AGI, but so is everybody else, and we think what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're doing now may be a good platform for future work in directions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to the ones you suggest.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Exactly this is my reaction: Sure I agree with your points, but our
<br>
current system is not supposed to be a true AGI...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If this is your reaction, then what I would like to see is a paper or book 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressing the &quot;grand Cyc vision&quot; -- i.e. what do you (or Lenat etc.) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; envision Cyc (the database and the AI system) looking like in, say, 5-20 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, when you have overcome limitations like the ones I've cited above 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and made a more fully fleshed out AI system?  Are there internal Cycorp 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documents addressing this sort of thing?
</em><br>
<p>I wish! Our system is so large, and our projects so pressing, that our day
<br>
to day focus is almost entirely incremental - just getting Cyc's
<br>
vocabulary more functional, and Cyc's deductive reasoning more
<br>
supportive.  Doug has a vision of what will happen, but it is more
<br>
opportunistic, postponing the details until Cyc knows enough to learn from
<br>
reading (for example).  Doug's view on Cyc's progress in five years are
<br>
published for the public in many popular articles which you can get from
<br>
Google.
<br>
<p>With the continuing reorganization of managers (all the staff wants to
<br>
work on AI - not manage others), we now have a small management team in
<br>
which the goal of creating an AI has begun to shape the features we
<br>
enhance or add. As I have pointed out, we have over 60 people (over
<br>
20 Ph.Ds) whose efforts I can somewhat influence.  OpenCyc is a mechanism
<br>
for others to contribute their own, possibly quite different ideas on how
<br>
to use/improve Cyc technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In terms of my own work, I think the Cyc DB could potentially be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting to feed into Novamente (my own AI system, which is more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrative in nature and less strictly focused on logic, although it does 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a probabilistic inference component; see www.realai.net for some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nontechnical info).   I suspect I could also learn something from the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've specialized Cyc's inference engines to deal with particular types of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, even though Novamente's inference engine does not use a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicate logic foundation.
</em><br>
<p>Looking forward to collaboration.
<br>
<p>Warm regards,
<br>
