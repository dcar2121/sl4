Ben, Eli
<br>
Hi.
<br>
<p>There are a couple others on this list with AGI or software projects in the 
<br>
works, but these are the two that I'm aware of, and have researched a bit.
<br>
<p>Now, the occasionally philosophic tussling between you two aside, you're 
<br>
both rather close to each other in Goals, difficulties and so on.
<br>
<p>So, my question is, what to do about money?
<br>
<p>I have very limited experience in this arena. I've funded one project, and 
<br>
had enough money to get it through initial stages, but the project itself 
<br>
flopped for different reasons. Plus, we got very lucky, getting funded the 
<br>
way we did. It nearly fell into our lap.
<br>
<p>But it seems that funding such projects should be first priority. Because 
<br>
money is power, and increased money leads to increased rate of development. 
<br>
So if you blitz, get word and so on into the VC community, and out to Angel 
<br>
investors, and stuff, and double your income, the net effect could be 
<br>
greater than if you spent all that time working on more &quot;AIish stuff&quot;. 
<br>
Because the influx of money gets you increased equipment, staff, and 
<br>
support. thus allowing you to work faster and better. (presumably)
<br>
<p>This is a rather recent thought of mine, so excuse the &quot;It's so obvious&quot; 
<br>
quality. It's why I'm spending more time improving my situation than on my 
<br>
projects right now. Because if I can bootstrap myself into a decent 
<br>
financial situation, I'll have more to work with. Previously, I've had 
<br>
something of a bohemian meme running around my head, saying &quot;money is bad, 
<br>
productive work is work spent on a idealogically pure perspective&quot;! The 
<br>
problem is that whoring around for money first allows you to achieve the 
<br>
actual goal faster, even if you lose the comfortable feeling of only working 
<br>
on Good things. And that's better.
<br>
<p>Presumably.
<br>

<br>
&quot;We can rebuild him, we have the technology, make him faster, stronger, 
<br>
better than before...&quot;
