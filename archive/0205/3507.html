&gt; What exactly is it that you object to. I know I don't write beautiful well
&gt; thought out compositions but this isn't an English class. I've always had
&gt; trouble in communicating, in fact I have a DX'd communications disorder;
&gt; Asperger's Syndrome. Personally I'd rather DO something to bring the
&gt; singularity about, rather then just write about it, and since I don't have
&gt; the knowledge to write AI software, what I can do is attempt to inform
&gt; people about what is going on.
&gt;
&gt; The biggest problem with this field is that it is fractured into hundreds of
&gt; different groups, each working on their own project, and not communicating,
&gt; except, seemingly, by well written papers in MLA format in academic
&gt; journals.  We don't need any more papers. We need plex. Lots of them. And
&gt; what people do write in &quot;standard&quot; format should be massively hyperlinked,
&gt; rather then forcing the reader to pore over any number of well written
&gt; lengthy paragraphs searching for what they really want to see.
&gt;
&gt;  I've been using theBrain for a while and I can tell you what a difference
&gt; it makes in terms of quick and easy access to information, and I think that
&gt; everyone who is working towards a common goal should have a common place to
&gt; facilitate advances. Think about what would happen if all those who worked
&gt; on AI software used nothing but the latest GUI based programs in their
&gt; development, instead of the standard Crappy Limited Interface (CLI), that so
&gt; many are using now.
