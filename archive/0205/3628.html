<p>
I'm not doing a complete commentary just yet, but one thing that jumped out
<br>
at me as new to our respective discussions was:
<br>
<p>&quot;One aspect of the dual network structure will be important for the
<br>
discussion of value systems to be presented here: generally, in a dual
<br>
network, the higher-up elements in the hierarchy are more abstract.&quot;
<br>
<p>This theme, as I understand it, is developed into the idea that an AI's
<br>
supergoals (&quot;basic values&quot;) will be very abstract, while its subgoals
<br>
(&quot;derived values&quot;) will be very concrete.
<br>
<p>Having read through the Novamente manuscript with all the little arrows
<br>
showing the dominance of simpler patterns over complex patterns, I think I
<br>
understand where Ben gets this intuition from, but I disagree; I think this
<br>
conflates event structure and category structure.  It's very traditional to
<br>
view category structure as a hierarchy with more abstract concepts at the
<br>
&quot;top&quot;, although whether this convention reflects real properties of the
<br>
system is debatable.  However, goals tend to center around neither very
<br>
abstract categories nor very concrete categories, but rather an intermediate
<br>
level called basic-level categories.  Basic-level categories have a wide
<br>
range of interesting properties; they tend to be the most abstract
<br>
categories for which you can still call up a specific mental image, the most
<br>
abstract categories such that you interact with all instances of the
<br>
category using the same motor routines, and so on.  Usually, the view is
<br>
that this convergence of easy visualization and sensorimotor support is what
<br>
makes &quot;basic-level&quot; categories useful enough to be ubiquitous subgoals.  I
<br>
would argue that we should consider a dual perspective in which (a) we tend
<br>
to choose basic-level subgoals because basic-level subgoals are easy to
<br>
think about and (b) we have evolved as organisms so that the most adaptively
<br>
useful regularities in event structure are basic-level categories relative
<br>
to our cognitive systems.
<br>
<p>So I would say that Friendliness content is (a) often quite easy to think
<br>
about as a basic-level category on our own terms, and that (b) even if
<br>
Friendliness content were not made up mostly of basic-level categories from
<br>
a human perspective, the AI might soon develop (both naturally, and with
<br>
programmer assistance) into a mind that saw the key concepts as basic-level
<br>
categories.  Even if this is not the case, I see no great difficulty in
<br>
stabilizing a Friendliness system where the central content is made up
<br>
mostly of highly abstract categories, so long as these abstract categories
<br>
are still subject to experiential feedback (even if it's as simple as the
<br>
programmer hitting a yes/no button) and so long as the abstract categories
<br>
are anchored by known relations to basic-level and concrete categories with
<br>
strong sensorimotor support.
