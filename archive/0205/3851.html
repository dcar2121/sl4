I think your premise is incorrect, though I agree that the amount of
<br>
hardware required is probably overstated. The flaw I see is that you are
<br>
assuming that all neural functions map to silicon with the roughly the
<br>
same efficiency.  This is almost certainly not the case. Audio and
<br>
visual processing are the same class of problem i.e. they are both very
<br>
similar types of signal processing functionality, and I would therefore
<br>
expect them to have roughly the same relative relationship to silicon in
<br>
terms of processing efficiency. Something like language functionality,
<br>
which does not appear to be terribly analogous to signal processing, may
<br>
have a substantially different relative processing efficiency for better
<br>
or worse.
<br>
<p>My intuition would be that signal processing type functionality is
<br>
actually one of the least efficient processes in the brain with relation
<br>
to its silicon counterpart, and would therefore stand to gain the most
<br>
by mapping it into silicon.

The experts have grossly over estimated the computational requirements

complete simulation of the human visual function.  And we have a good

idea of the neuroanatomy of these systems.  Simply take how much

hardware does it take to simulate these functions, how much of the brain

do these functions comprise, extrapolate how much hardware it takes to

simulate the whole brain.
