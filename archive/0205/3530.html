It's not really about a website itself becoming self aware. It's about
<br>
making those who use it aware. That is the whole point of IA. Friendliness
<br>
and morality would be designed into ultimately resulting Real AI's because
<br>
these principles would become a part of the collective intelligence of this
<br>
website, which would of course include the Singularity Institute and other
<br>
institutions like it. I just want to see all these different groups' effort
<br>
being channeled in the most effective way possible, in the most direct way
<br>
possible, toward the singularity. If Pflop level computers exist and IA
<br>
exists then I think that we can, and should, finally get off our collective
<br>
butts and make it happen as soon as possible.

Subject: Singularity Consortium Inquiry
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Hullo, I'm Michael Anissimov, a Singularitarian, and I saw your post to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SL4 list about a &quot;Singularity Consortium&quot; website.  It sounds like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an interesting idea, even a great one, except for one part.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably wouldn't want a website to &quot;take off and become self-aware&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without the human moral frame of reference.  Meaning, morality doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come from nowhere; it's a set of complex functional adapations that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all have in common as humans, and must be explicitly programmed in to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yield morality.  Before you go off trying to create sentience in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; website, I suggest you read Eliezer Yudkowsky's &quot;Creating Friendly AI&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe it's better not to approach this saying &quot;we are going to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big new website, get all the Real AI companies involved, get tons of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people involved, and initiate the Singularity&quot;.  Maybe it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better to say &quot;*I* (not &quot;we&quot;) am starting on a project to network
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing Singularitarians, spread the Singularity meme, and learn more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about AI in the process&quot;.  Keep in mind that Cyc is not an AI, it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even close to one.  Cyc is a knowledge base, a bunch of phrases that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans would notice when talking to other humans - it doesn't have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying cognitive complexity that humans use for general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence in the first place.  RealAI.net and Singinst.org are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only serious projects to create Real, self-improving, *Friendly* AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I think rather than going off in your own direction in a tangent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like how so many would-be Singularitarians are doing, such as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amygdala (sp) project, we should all focus on the big effort which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already there - what the Singularity Institute is doing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest calming down ever so slightly, reading the &quot;Singularitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Principles&quot;, read some of what Eliezer has wrote on Singularity-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiating AI, and then approach this project carefully and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculatedly.  We wouldn't *want* a website to obtain sentience.  But a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; website like the one you are proposing could do wonders for giving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarian community publicity, perhaps attract funding, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attract a lot of potential new Singularitarians.  In fact, if this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your goal, then I'd be happy to help you on developing your project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd appreciate if you'd respond with the present outline of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project, and whose attention you've attracted so far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yours in Singularity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Anissimov
