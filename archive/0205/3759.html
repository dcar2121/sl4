yo,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; a) code a prototype DGI AGI system yourself, to show off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess it's just *inherently implausible* that AGI is too large for one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person to build a prototype that does anything convincingly powerful...
</em><br>
<p>Hell no, my own AGI designs are complicated enuf that it would take me
<br>
*many* years to build a convincing prototype on my own....  Thus I never
<br>
took this route
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uh... no offense or anything, but I tend to view this entire line of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument as &quot;Ben tries to frame the problem so that all the funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically goes to Novamente.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Dude, there is a LOT of money in the world and Novamente cannot absorb a
<br>
very large percentage of it.
<br>
<p>You and I are very far from being in a zero sum game as regards research
<br>
funding
<br>
<p>I actually WANT you, and Peter, and others building AGI to get as much
<br>
funding as possible.  Sure, it's *conceivable* we could someday be in the
<br>
position of competing for the same funding source, but it's not the case
<br>
right now, and doesn't seem so likely to happen in the near future.
<br>
<p>As you know, I've tried to interest some funding sources in my circle in
<br>
SIAI, but without success.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll go on creating the DGI design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because that's on the direct critical path to AI; this is also one of many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that increases the probability of obtaining funding.
</em><br>
<p>Writing up your design in a clear and concrete way so that a
<br>
philanthropist's &quot;comp sci expert&quot; buddy can understand it, will definitely
<br>
increases the probability of your getting funding
<br>
<p>The same can be said for me: a clearer and more concrete writeup of my AGI
<br>
design will enhance my chances of getting pure research funding as opposed
<br>
to commercial application funding.  And as you saw from the Novamente
<br>
manuscript, I am definitely not there yet, my own exposition of my design
<br>
needs a lot of work...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; DGI is less than a design paper, but it is more than the philosophy paper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are trying to paint it as.  I'm not quite sure you understood the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-philosophy parts, though.  You may have thought I was talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical-ish emergent behaviors when I was talking about design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties with design consequences.
</em><br>
<p>In calling your paper philosophical, I was using the term &quot;philosophy&quot;
<br>
loosely.  In the same way as I'd call my book &quot;Chaotic Logic&quot; a
<br>
philosophical work even though there are significant scientific,
<br>
mathematical, and software design sections (some of them much more explicit
<br>
regarding software design than anything in the DGI paper).
<br>
<p>I think I may have a higher opinion of philosophy as it relates to AI, than
<br>
you do.  My calling something &quot;philosophy&quot; is not intended as derogatory in
<br>
any way...
<br>
<p>I understand the DGI paper, in parts, was talking about design properties
<br>
with potential design consequences -- but the design consequences were not
<br>
drawn out very clearly or explicitly.  The paper is already very long and I
<br>
don't think that concrete design consequences need to be in the paper, of
<br>
course.  But they definitely need to be spelled out more clearly if non-Eli
<br>
individuals are to understand them!
<br>
