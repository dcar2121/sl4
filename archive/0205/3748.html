<em>&gt; IF the complexity of an AGI needs to be &gt; T, THEN it makes sense to focus

</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain/mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<p>Human brains are currently implemented for a specific embodiment.  The
<br>
sensory I/O channels for that embodiment would have to be duplicated almost
<br>
exactly for the brain being simulated to be able to do/think anything, IMO.
<br>
<p>I have not seen anyone address this issue substantively... that is scary.
<br>
*I* would like to upload eventually, and thus avoid death, but I want to
<br>
upload into a device that provides at least the same quality sensory I/O as
<br>
I have in my current body.  The recreation of sensory modalities in a
<br>
non-biological substrate seems to be a solvable engineering problem, even
<br>
with today's level of scientific knowledge.  But connecting that new
<br>
hardware to the uploaded mind in a way that will make sense to that mind,
<br>
would seem like a much more difficult problem.  To do *that* right, would
<br>
require the human brain be simulated in advance of upload, and that the I/O
<br>
channels for all the senses be mapped from the wetware to the hardware.  In
<br>
order to do this, you are going to have to understand exactly how the
<br>
brain's mental processes work.  There is no short-cut available here.
<br>
Without this detailed mapping, the process of uploading will be horrific
<br>
beyond anyone's worst nightmare.
