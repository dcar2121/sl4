*Cough.*  Let's distinguish between Singularity fanfics (some of which I
<br>
confess to having written myself, such as the X17 pastiche) and SF stories
<br>
of sufficient quality that someone might conceivably think about publishing
<br>
them (of which I have written only two, perhaps three, over the course of my
<br>
lifetime so far).  There is a long, long, long stretch between the two.  The
<br>
saying is that you must write a million words to throw away before you
<br>
manage to write anything good.  I'm not quite through with my million words
<br>
yet.  Certainly if I've written a million words it's in nonfiction, not
<br>
fiction - I think I might be able to consistently write good fiction given a
<br>
few solid years of practice, but it doesn't look now like I'll ever be able
<br>
to get that practice done.
<br>
<p>Fiction or nonfiction, expect your first work to suck.  It is a universal
<br>
law.  I can't read the things I wrote in 1996, 1998, or occasionally even
<br>
2000 without my brain blowing a fuse and shutting down (and I did expect, at
<br>
the time, that this was how things would eventually work out).  Let's not
<br>
scare away the people who've *already* written their million words with our
<br>
dreadful fanfics... true, any professional author has probably gotten used
<br>
to it by now, but I also expect that it's still annoying.
<br>
<p>Not that SL4 is an inappropriate forum for fanfics or anything.  SL4 is an
<br>
OK place to post dreadful Singularity fanfics in the hopes of eventually
<br>
getting to readable Singularity fanfics.  I'm just saying we should
<br>
distinguish between &quot;Singularity fanfic&quot; and actual attempts at Singularity
<br>
fiction - i.e., stories having character, plot, development, resolution, and
<br>
all that literary stuff.
