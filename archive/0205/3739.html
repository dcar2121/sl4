Thanks for the reply, Ben, some thoughts below...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From: &quot;Ben Goertzel&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=RE:%20AI%20in%20&lt;what?&gt;">ben@goertzel.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Visio-spatial organization is useful but also limiting, and it is only one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;among very  many possible ways to structure thoughts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think Novamente *should* be given camera eyes someday.  However, I don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think this is *necessary*, just a convenience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Indeed, the directory structure is limited, more so than the visuospatial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world.  What if an AI modeled part of its concept hierarchy on structures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it saw in chem and bio databases?  A lot of interesting metaphors there....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How about weather satellite data from around the world?  There is a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more richness of data on the Net than Web pages and directories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I fear that you're anthropomorphizing to a large degree, assuming that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human perceptual-manipulative environment is somehow the best one...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe to an AI that grew up on the net, the spatially-limited perspective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an individual human would seem terrifyingly, painfully limited... even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;wonky&quot; as you say ;.&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, quite so. My worry is not that human spatial perception and 
<br>
organization is better/best. It's that the net kind of sucks. Now, dont' get 
<br>
me wrong, it's possible that a mindsystem with it as it's native environment 
<br>
might see emergent patterns and find this very enlightening and whatnot, but 
<br>
the Net is largely a repository of knowledge about the physical world. And 
<br>
without a way to relate this data, much of what it finds is going to be 
<br>
useless.
<br>
<p>So I worry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; NOW. Just what level of complexity in environment is needed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; AI to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it all the way to AGI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think we have any theory adequate to tell us that, it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determined via experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Of course we can't know that, I wasn't suggesting....
<br>
Okay, how about this. I was just wondering where the experiments should 
<br>
start, that's all. I'd be perfectly willing to build Novamente a robot body 
<br>
if I thought it was neccesary, but I'm not sure it is. But I think it can be 
<br>
shown in theory what kinds of feedback and opportunities an AI should have.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But I have an intuition that mental organization is dependent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and what tools the AI has to interpret that. So an AI that lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the Net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might never work at all, because of insufficient environmental feedback.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I agree, this is possible...
</em><br>
<p>Heh. this doesn't sound like you're internally saying 'plausible, too' while 
<br>
you write this.
<br>
My big worry is that the net, being largely made up of static images, won't 
<br>
be able to give the AI enough to work with.
<br>
<p>I'm drawn to the image Dossy made on Extropians, of his toddler playing with 
<br>
a door to figure out how door hinges work. All the AI gets is pictures of 
<br>
doors, except on local nets where it has permissions to play. That sounds 
<br>
really sucky to me. How will it learn if it can't act?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Or, as I suspect, it might work VERY DIFFERENTLY than humans because of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;VERY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;DIFFERENT environmental feedback!
</em><br>
<p>heh. Well, yeah.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I think that socialization requires more than a chat window; it requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interaction with other minds in a shared perceivable/manipulable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment
</em><br>
<p>Well. I wasn't saying it HAD to be a chat window, I was just saying that 
<br>
chat windows are an example of non-physical social interaction. Novamentes 
<br>
transferring direct mindstuff, and Eliezertrons passing flarespeke are both 
<br>
examples of non-physical socialization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So I think that it is pretty  much on a par with the other things you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mention
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I think it could be MORE important than the points I brought up. I just 
<br>
dont' see it as an aspect of explicit environmental design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not a critical point though!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ben
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now now ben, with the error tolerances we're dealing with, they all could be 
<br>
critical points!
