<p>Which technologies, specifically? Rate of change measured in what? There's

a succession in core technologies powering progress in a given period of

time, so your metric will necessarily either have limited applicability in

time, or be complex, including a list of technologies, quantities

expressed in same metric, impact factors, and the like.

<em>&gt; The pace of technology change has increased over human history, as has

<p>I agree with you in principle, but I disagree that you can force the
<br>
explanation into a monocausal framework, and into a metric as simple as
<br>
&quot;bits/s processing rate&quot;. This way lies bad science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; new ideas, and thus the pace of progress, would be simply proportional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the human population.  This is the simplest hypothesis.
</em><br>
<p>Rules similiar to economies of scale seem to indicate that the payoff is
<br>
overproportionally greater in larger populations. I presume you could
<br>
easily pull up hundreds of papers from a range of disciplines (mostly
<br>
economics, probably) from a Google session, including those with enough
<br>
real world data.
<br>
<p>I'm objecting to a reasoning based on pure armchair conjecture, while the
<br>
tools for production of significantly better models are literally at your
<br>
fingertips.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; In general, you can create a range of hypotheses or models in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rate of progress is a function of quantity of intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality of intelligence.  In the example above, it is assumed that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only quantity contributes.  In the second example from my previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post, only the quality factor was assumed to contribute.  I think in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality there is a contribution from both factors.  So to come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my projection, I took both extremes and averaged them.
</em><br>
<p>As long as there is no metrics, and no realworld data to fit your model
<br>
there's very little point in building models based no real-world
<br>
constraints.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 10^17 figure is the number of synapses in the brain (10^15) times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the average firing rate of the synapses (100 Hz).  The uncertainty is
</em><br>
<p>The assumptions here are that the synapse is the processing element, and
<br>
that the spike firing rate is identical to bitrate. Both are not safe
<br>
assumptions. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; whether there is a lot of redundancy in the brain's wiring or whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a synapse firing represents more than one bit of data, and also how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of the brain is used for running the rest of the body and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not be needed for pure thinking.
</em><br>
<p>What is &quot;pure thinking&quot; please? Why should &quot;pure thinking&quot; be relevant for 
<br>
real-world AI?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; While I don't know which hypothesis is correct, the interesting thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me is they lead to similar answers as to timeframe.
</em><br>
<p>That's not surprising, since your reasoning is based on an exponential 
<br>
progress model.
