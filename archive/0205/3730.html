<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I have thought a little about your intuition that an AGI needs to be 1-2
<br>
orders of magnitude more complex than Novamente.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that there is some threshold T so that the following holds.
<br>
<p>IF the complexity of an AGI needs to be &gt; T, THEN it makes sense to focus
<br>
efforts on human brain simulation (as advocated by Kurzweil, Eugene Leitl,
<br>
and many others), rather than on designing systems loosely inspired by the
<br>
human brain/mind.
<br>
<p>And, as far as I understand it, your DGI approach is more brainlike than
<br>
Novamente, but still &quot;loosely inspired by the human brain-mind&quot; rather than
<br>
being a cellular or molecular level simulation.
<br>
<p>What is T?
<br>
<p>My intuition is that T is around, roughly, 3-5 times the complexity of the
<br>
current Novamente design.  Beyond this level, the difficulties of
<br>
parameter-tuning and engineering and performance analysis are just going to
<br>
become WAY too great for any team of humans to handle.
<br>
<p>Novamente is now about 30K lines of C++, it will be somewhere between 100K -
<br>
300K when done.  The total complexity of the algorithms in it probably does
<br>
not exceed that of the algorithms in a complex program like an efficient C++
<br>
compiler.  (Compilers have all sorts of shit in them, graph-coloring
<br>
algorithms, conversions between different types of trees, etc. etc. etc.)
<br>
However, the algorithms in a compiler are hooked together in a rigid and
<br>
predictable way, whereas the algorithms in Novamente are adaptive and self-
<br>
and inter-referential, which means that the testing/tuning process for
<br>
Novamente is going to vastly exceed that of a compiler (as we discovered in
<br>
building and toying with Webmind!!).
<br>
<p>The human mind/brain contains a lot of specialized inference, perception and
<br>
action modules, dealing with things like spatial and temporal inference,
<br>
social reasoning, aspects of language processing, each sensory stream that
<br>
we have, etc. etc.
<br>
<p>If an AGI has to be engineered to contain *significantly qualitatively
<br>
different* code for each of these specialized functional mind-modules, then
<br>
I suggest that this AGI is going to be 10-20 times more complex than
<br>
Novamente, and hence over my intuitively posited T value.  In other words,
<br>
rather than build a system like this, which will have so many parameters it
<br>
will be un-tunable, we'd be better off to focus on brain scanning and
<br>
cellular brain simulation.  In my guesswork opinion...
<br>
<p>On the other hand, my hypothesis is that we can achieve these specialized
<br>
functions by appropriately modifying the parameters of a handful of
<br>
individually-narrowly-intelligent, intelligently interacting learning
<br>
algorithms.  If this is true then something of *borderline manageable
<br>
complexity* like Novamente (or, say, A2I2) can work, and we don't
<br>
necessarily need to follow the path of detailed human brain simulation.
<br>
<p>One may argue that each decade software and hardware tech get better,
<br>
enabling us to build more &amp; more complex software systems.  It is true.  But
<br>
we do run up against barriers of human psychology and limitations of human
<br>
communication.  Novamente is already WAY more complex in its inter-component
<br>
interactions than anything ever built... barring an intervining Singularity,
<br>
it'll be at least a decade, maybe a few, before software systems of this
<br>
complexity are routine in the sense that transaction systems and big OO
<br>
systems of other sorts are routine today.
<br>
