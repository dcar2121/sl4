</em><br>
<p>I likewise have been keeping track of hardware and Moore's law curve. But
<br>
for Cyc-style processing I use integer operations, not floating-point. Cyc
<br>
runs on a lisp runtime system that we wrote in portable C (gcc).  Very few
<br>
floating point operations are used; mainly our runtime is pointer chasing,
<br>
and type bit-stripping.  So I use SpecINT2000 benchmarks which are
<br>
available for many current and historical CPUs.  Then I set mips =
<br>
4*SpecINT2000 and plot mips on a log chart for CPU by year
<br>
introduced.  Hans Morovac has published his belief that the human brain
<br>
runs at 100 million mips. 
<br>
<p>Regarding disk storage, Cyc-style systems are memory bound and would
<br>
operate with modest shared network storage.  I would drop storage from the
<br>
unit cluster computation, because as you know a linux cluster does not
<br>
require disk storage for each node.  I would also drop the networking cost
<br>
from each unit because you can use a motherboard with an internal
<br>
NIC.  You can (if you wish) add in a fixed cost for racks, hubs and UPS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If optimistic estimates of the required computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power for human-level AI are correct at 100 TFlop/s,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it presently costs $31.9M to buy a human's worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of computers. 
</em><br>
<p>Here is my calculation assuming AMD Athlon 2000+, boot-up from
<br>
network, and omitting fixed costs (not a recommended system, just
<br>
low-price parts):
<br>
<p>Case:         $25 Generic Mid-ATX w/300W power supply
<br>
Motherboard + CPU + NIC:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$185 830LR, Athlon 2000+, onboard NIC
<br>
DRAM         $216 qty 2 PC2700 DDR
<br>
<p>total        $426/node
<br>
<p>$426 / 2896 mips per node = $.147 / mips per node
<br>
100 mil mips / 2896 mips per node = 34,530 nodes per 100 mil mips
<br>
$426 * 34,530 nodes = $14.7 mil per full time Human Equivalent Computing 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have estimated an 'economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crossover' of $3M for 100 TFlop/s when computers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become generally cheaper than humans.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on a computer being able to put in 5x as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many productive hours as an average human, a 5 year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payback time on the hardware, and $120K as the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost per year of a technical professional.  We are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore about 3.4 doublings in performance/$
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from economic crossover.  At current rates of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cost reduction, that would be reached in early 2004.
</em><br>
<p>$120K x 5 x 5 = $3 mil crossover.
<br>
<p>$14.7 mil is approximately five times your crossover, which by Moore's law
<br>
is about four years away (somewhat more than two halvings in cost for
<br>
similar performance), about the year 2006.
<br>
<p>In the near future the hardware extrapolation is upset by AMD's
<br>
introduction of the Opteron AMD32-64 architecture.  Kurzweil has argued
<br>
that Moore's law will accelerate and this may be evidence.  Cyc will use
<br>
the 64-bit architecture to contain much larger knowledge bases in RAM. By
<br>
this time next year, I expect a hypothetical Opteron single CPU cluster to
<br>
achieve Human Equivalent Computing with half the number of nodes,
<br>
approximately 17,000.  By 2006 (roughly) only 4,000 nodes would be
<br>
required, using more powerful CPUs projected to be available.  A cube 16
<br>
nodes per side would yield 4096 nodes to give you an idea of the physical
<br>
space requirement.  And because AMD Opterons are designed for N-way
<br>
multiprocessor implementations, one might imagine constructing a cluster
<br>
in which each node is a 4-way Opteron.  Thus 1000 nodes (containing the
<br>
4000 CPUs) would occupy a cube only 10 nodes per side.
<br>
<p>Note that Human Equivalent Computing is only a comparison between
<br>
benchmarked computer performance and theorized human brain computational
<br>
power - not any measure of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
