<em>&gt;  Giving several generic stepwise problem-solving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common representation is certainly not a trivial design problem, but it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still a design problem which is much easier than the functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decomposition of general intelligence into interdependent, internally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialized subsystems.
</em><br>
<p><p>As you know we have an approach to that, apparently one that you don't like.
<br>
We have a design involving a number of benfunctionally specialized &quot;units&quot;
<br>
each of which has its own  mix of MindAgents with special parameter values.
<br>
<p>My own feeling is that the &quot;functional specialization&quot; design problem is
<br>
actually a bit easier than the &quot;get various learning methods to work
<br>
together&quot; design problem.
<br>
<p>Again, different intuitions.  Time and experimentation will tell.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And my continuing project is to get you to disgorge these experiences, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just some of the highlights, in a sufficiently concrete form that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful to a next generation of cognitive scientists who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the lens of other theories.
</em><br>
<p>Well, right now, the Webmind AI Engine IP is owned by somebody else, so
<br>
there's no chance we're going to write up a bunch of stuff describing our
<br>
experiences with it.
<br>
<p>All in all, we're more inclined to spend our time working on the new system
<br>
than describing our experiences with the old.
<br>
<p>In not too long, we'll have new stories to tell about Novamente (rather than
<br>
Webmind), which we'll be quite eager to share with all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps my memory is tricking me, but I think that if you look through the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list archives of SL4, you will find that I have never once said, on SL4 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any other public forum, that Novamente was an AI-go-splat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debacle in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making, until after I'd read the Novamente manuscript.  Because my memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says that I was very careful not to say this until I'd posted a review of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your system and given you a chance to defend it.  Just FYI.
</em><br>
<p>You are correct, prior to reading the manuscript you expressed your
<br>
skepticism in a much more mild way.
<br>
<p>Since reading the manuscript however, you have expressed this opinion quite
<br>
a few times!!
<br>
<p>In my opinion, an adequate number of times that everyone knows your
<br>
opinion...
