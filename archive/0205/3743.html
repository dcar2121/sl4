<em>&gt; Well, quite so. My worry is not that human spatial perception and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organization is better/best. It's that the net kind of sucks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, dont' get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me wrong, it's possible that a mindsystem with it as it's native
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might see emergent patterns and find this very enlightening and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatnot, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Net is largely a repository of knowledge about the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without a way to relate this data, much of what it finds is going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I worry.
</em><br>
<p>I agree and I do share the worry, just to a lesser extent...
<br>
<p>My work with net data has spanned 3 areas: text analysis, bio db analysis,
<br>
and financial time series analysis...
<br>
<p>Intuitively, I get the feeling a lot of symbol grounding can be done in the
<br>
context of financial and bio db's.  The language used to discuss the data in
<br>
the db's can be grounded in the db's itself.  The feasibility of this is
<br>
suggested by projects like the Gene Ontology Project, which tries to
<br>
systematize the language used in describing bio db's ...
<br>
<p>One vision I have here is of a bunch of simpler Alife organisms -- internet
<br>
agent/animals -- interacting with each other and mining financial and bio
<br>
and weather and commercial data etc.  This digital biota becomes its own
<br>
little world; Novamente is to these little agents as humans are to other
<br>
animals....  And, it's not true that *all* this data is primarily grounded
<br>
in the physical world -- finance these days has as much to do with the net
<br>
as with the physical world for example....  Economic data as well...
<br>
<p>I want Novamente to have feelers into various part of the Net, plus camera
<br>
eyes and artificial ears.  It must understand music so I can jam with it ;&gt;
<br>
<p>In terms of Novamente, I don't think it's important that there be agreement
<br>
on what info. sources are necessary to what degree, not at the current stage
<br>
of the project.  It is more necessary in Eliezer's AI approach because he
<br>
grounds cognition so tightly in &quot;mental imagery.&quot;  I think cognitive
<br>
algorithmics is pretty much sensory-modality and actuator independent...
<br>
The *emergent dynamics* on gets in a mind are highly dependent upon
<br>
sensorimotor particulars, but the *ability of a codebase to give rise to
<br>
emergent mind dynamics* in my view depends on cognitive stuff rather than
<br>
sensorimotor particulars.  So I've chosen to focus on cognitive stuff for
<br>
starters...
<br>
<p>These certainly are deep and interesting issues and I wish I had more to say
<br>
about them than &quot;we'll see&quot; but I guess &quot;we'll see&quot; is my opinion  ;-&gt;
