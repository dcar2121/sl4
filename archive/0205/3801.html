<p><em>&gt; GOFAI philosophers are famous for insisting that the relations between words

<em>&gt; that the perceptual patterns invoked by words also have something to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Cyc operates from the assumption that meaning can be expressed
<br>
as relationships among concepts, insofar as passing tests of understanding
<br>
-- for example question answering.  
<br>
<p>We do draw a distinction between words and concepts, according to GOFCL
<br>
(Good Old Fashioned Computational Linguistics).  Words are elements of
<br>
natural language and concepts are the elements of the (Cyc) knowledge
<br>
base. 
<br>
<p>I suppose that given a sufficient model (or lots of instances) of what you
<br>
call perceptual patterns, I would try to determine a vocabulary to assert
<br>
relationships among the objects in the perception. Fuzzy terms could be
<br>
used to collapse the (overly precise) features from visual
<br>
perceptions.  So if the system were shown enough pictures of Apples,
<br>
then the assertions might of the form: &quot;Apples are approximately red in
<br>
color&quot; &quot;Apples are about 5 cm in diameter&quot;.  Given a KB containing such
<br>
assertions, and a vision system extracting those features, I believe that
<br>
Cyc could classify a new picture as an Apple picture or not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also think that being able to reconstruct a scrambled concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net, in this way, is a necessary condition for saying that the AI possesses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge about the concept behind the word, and not just knowledge about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the word is likely to be used in proximity to other words.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we will face a smaller problem of the same sort, when OpenCyc is
<br>
positioned as a Semantic Web Server.  How does one Cyc understand concepts
<br>
created by another peer Cyc?  We allow the term names to be created in the
<br>
natural language of the author.  Likewise comments may be in languages
<br>
other than English.  Term names and comments are opaque to Cyc's current
<br>
reasoning, so our plan is to perform analogical reasoning and
<br>
classification to fit new knowledge (semi) automatically into the Cyc
<br>
reference ontology.   [&quot;Chien&quot; is a small domestic animal that
<br>
barks.  Maybe it is the same thing as Cyc's reference Dog.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that from a Cyc's-eye-view, Cyc may know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something about the grammatical structure of English strings; it knows which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English strings are synonyms for English strings, and which English strings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are properties of English strings that describe categories, and which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English strings denote events that cause events denoted by other English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strings to occur, and so on, but it doesn't have any idea which events and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categories the English strings correspond to.
</em><br>
<p>As far as question answering is concerned, I would say there are many
<br>
cases in which Cyc's understanding of the concepts denoted by English
<br>
words is testable.  For example &quot;World War II&quot; denotes the term
<br>
c0fd5d2b-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270 which has the name WorldWarII. Cyc
<br>
knows (has the assertion): The Nuremberg Trials starts after the end
<br>
of World War II. In CycL: (startsAfterEndingOf NurembergTrials WorldWarII)
<br>
Cyc could be asked (in the CycL equivalent to) &quot;Did the Nurenburg Trials
<br>
occur before World War II?&quot; and respond &quot;No&quot; and give the justification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I had to pick an incremental direction for Cyc (as opposed to a complete philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revision), I think it would be focusing on those Cyc concepts that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounded in the complex data of Cyc's internals - i.e., teaching Cyc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptual concepts for its own internals.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, as that is a path to Seed AI.
