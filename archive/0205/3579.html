<p>
In reviewing Peter Voss's A2I2 I'm working with much less information than I
<br>
have for Ben Goertzel's Novamente.  My review of Novamente is based on
<br>
reading the Novamente manuscript and having extensive conversations with
<br>
Ben; my review of A2I2 is based on seeing part of a demo at the Foresight
<br>
Gathering before I had to leave for the airport (aaargh!), which hopefully
<br>
was enough to give me a glimpse of the underlying architecture, plus various
<br>
bits of surrounding information, a few small exchanges with Voss, and so on.
<br>
<p>Unlike Ben with Novamente, Peter Voss has not, as far as I know, expressed a
<br>
belief that A2I2's current architecture is adequate to general intelligence
<br>
or seed AI; Voss's philosophy of AI is that you start by building a mouse. 
<br>
Okay.  Not my personal approach but not an invalid approach either.  After
<br>
seeing the demo my reaction was again that A2I2 was simpler than I'd
<br>
expected, but that could just be because it was a demo.
<br>
<p>What I saw in the demo was an AI with a visual grid operating at multiple
<br>
scales of resolution, and a network of nodes in which each node represented
<br>
a visual pattern.  When A2I2 runs across a visual pattern it hasn't seen
<br>
before - a visual pattern below a defined threshold of similarity to any
<br>
existing nodes - it creates a new node.  Parts of A2I2 explicitly indicated
<br>
as being absent from the demo include A2I2's ability to issue motor actions
<br>
and a reinforcement system that links perceptions to actions.  (&quot;Visual
<br>
pattern&quot; and &quot;motor action&quot; means A2I2 is bouncing around in the visual
<br>
environment of a 2D microworld, not that it's a robot.)
<br>
<p>I guess my overall reaction is that this is fine as far as it goes, but I'm
<br>
not sure what Voss plans to do with it when it's finished.  Build a better
<br>
Norn?
