Join National Call-In to Support Therapeutic Cloning Research -- this
<br>
Wednesday, May 8   
<br>
<p>To everyone who has signed our petition to keep therapeutic cloning
<br>
research legal, 
<br>
Thank you for your support on this important issue.  We hope that you
<br>
will help us spread the word about Call Your Senators Day, Wednesday May
<br>
8th, to everyone you know.  This effort is being organized by the
<br>
Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR), an umbrella
<br>
group of nationally-recognized patient organizations, universities,
<br>
scientific societies, foundations, and individuals with life-threatening
<br>
illnesses. 
<br>
<p>With the Senate debate on therapeutic cloning research now only days
<br>
away, and Senator Hatch having announced his support of our position, we
<br>
have considerable political momentum.   But we cannot afford to let up
<br>
now.  Please join us on May 8 by calling your Senators to express your
<br>
support for therapeutic cloning research. 
<br>
<p>Best, 
<br>
<p>Raymond Barglow and Richard Arvedon 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research 
</em><br>
<p>Urgent!  Action Alert 
<br>
<p>MAY 8TH CALL YOUR SENATORS 
<br>
<p>Call the Capitol Switchboard at 202-224-3121 to be connected to the
<br>
offices of the Senators in your state.
<br>
<p>Thank you for all of your hard work, but we cannot stop now.  The Senate
<br>
will vote in the next few weeks on legislation that would ban somatic
<br>
cell nuclear transfer technology (SCNT, sometimes called therapeutic
<br>
cloning).  The Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR)
<br>
is coordinating a Call-Your-Senators Day, May 8th.  Please spread the
<br>
word and ask your colleagues, friends and family to call the Capitol
<br>
Switchboard at 202-224-3121, and ask to speak with your Senators'
<br>
office.  Tell them why you believe SCNT research must be allowed to
<br>
continue. 
<br>
<p>As you know, the Senate has already held hearings on S. 1899, a bill by
<br>
Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) that would
<br>
ban all cloning including SCNT; put researchers in prison; and deny
<br>
patients the benefit of any therapies developed from therapeutic cloning
<br>
outside the United States. 
<br>
<p>This week, Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Dianne
<br>
Feinstein (D-CA) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA) have joined together to
<br>
sponsor S. 2439, legislation that would ban reproductive cloning to
<br>
create children, but permit privately funded research involving SCNT.
<br>
This legislation is widely supported among scientific, medical, and
<br>
patient groups.  The Senate may vote on this bill as well. 
<br>
<p>WHAT SHOULD YOU DO? 
<br>
<p>Two Steps: 
<br>
<p>1.  Click &lt;<a href="http://www.camradvocacy.org/">http://www.camradvocacy.org/</a>&gt; to be taken to the website of
<br>
the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research.  This site will
<br>
provide background information on the current debate. 
<br>
<p>2.  Coordinate with your friends and family to call the Capitol
<br>
Switchboard, 202-224-3121, on May 8th and urge your Senators to SUPPORT
<br>
S. 2439, THE SPECTER/FEINSTEIN/HATCH/KENNEDY BILL AND OPPOSE S. 1899,
<br>
THE BROWNBACK/LANDRIEU BILL, which will criminalize potentially
<br>
life-saving medical research. 
<br>
<p>Make your support of SCNT known!!!!!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Message points for your call: 
<br>
<p>. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is not the science fiction you
<br>
see in movies, but rather a reasonable and appropriate way to alleviate
<br>
the horrors faced by patients suffering from deadly and painful
<br>
diseases. 
<br>
<p>. Cloning is widely used, vital medical tool that has allowed scientists
<br>
and researchers to develop powerful new drugs; produce insulin and
<br>
useful bacteria in the lab; track the origins of biological weapons;
<br>
catch criminals and free innocent people; and produce new plants and
<br>
livestock to help feed an undernourished world population. 
<br>
<p>. The nation's leading scientists, including two prestigious committees
<br>
of the National Academy of Sciences, agree that cloning to reproduce
<br>
humans should be illegal, but that SCNT (or therapeutic cloning) should
<br>
be permitted. 
<br>
<p>. SCNT is a research technique to develop cells that can be used to
<br>
treat or cure chronic and degenerative diseases and disorders.  The
<br>
process has nothing to do with sexual reproduction.  Its sole purpose is
<br>
research to meet unmet medical needs. 
<br>
<p>. By moving stem cell research forward, SCNT could bring new hope to the
<br>
nearly 100 million Americans who suffer from cancer, Alzheimer's,
<br>
diabetes, hepatitis, Parkinson's disease and other devastating
<br>
conditions for which treatments must still be found. 
<br>
<p>. SCNT allows a patient's own genetic material to be used to develop
<br>
advanced stem cell therapies. These therapies-including transplants and
<br>
transfusions-- would be tailored to match each patient's specific
<br>
medical condition and dramatically reduce the possibility of causing the
<br>
patient's immune system to attack and reject the therapy. 
<br>
<p>The Brownback bill would have devastating results. 
<br>
<p>It would: 
<br>
<p>. Ban SCNT, or therapeutic cloning, cutting-off hope to millions of
<br>
Americans with life-threatening diseases; 
<br>
<p>. Make it illegal for U.S. citizens to seek SCNT treatment abroad; 
<br>
<p>. Send a U.S. scientist to jail for developing SCNT therapies in a petri
<br>
dish; 
<br>
<p>. Make it illegal for U.S. scientists to import SCNT therapies that were
<br>
developed in other countries.
