What continues to amaze me is the solidity and definiteness of belief that 
<br>
some folks display, as regards future technological and social 
<br>
developments.
<br>
<p>It's inevitable that each of us should have some biases and believes (one 
<br>
guy thinks a hard takeoff will occur in N years, another in M years; one 
<br>
guy thinks the global brain will emerge without cranial jacks or radical 
<br>
genetic engineering, etc.).  But I think we should all take our OWN beliefs 
<br>
on such matters with a very large shaker of salt.
<br>
<p>Sure, one doesn't want to get so bogged down with doubt that one is unable 
<br>
to act productively!  But let's have a little respect for the pragmatic 
<br>
*unknowability* of what's to come...

<p><p><p><em>&gt; I do believe that an increase in intelligence in the world will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a major impact on what it means to be human. However I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not believe in the hard take off. So even if you get a transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI, unless it takes over the whole internet, I don't believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will go to super intelligence. Just my beliefs, to explain why I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am leaving. Here is my belief one last time, that AI's without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wills of their own interacting with humans controllers and each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other in a vast network of people will cause a meta-system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transition/super organism. Cross between web waking up and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence augmentation.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that the metasystem transition to an emergent superorganism is a
<br>
viable possibility.
<br>
<p>I also believe that the &quot;hard takeoff&quot; in which a self-modifying AI
<br>
bootstraps itself to superintelligence is a viable possibility.
<br>
<p>Currently, it seems to me that the *second* possibility is likely to become
<br>
real before the first.  And when the second possibility becomes real, then
<br>
the whole underpinnings of the first possibility become revised.
<br>
<p>However, it is certainly *rational* at this point to maintain that 
<br>
achieving
<br>
&quot;real AI&quot; will take so long that the &quot;emergent superorganism&quot; phenomenon
<br>
appears first.
<br>
<p>I know there are several others on this list besides myself who have some
<br>
sympathy for the &quot;emergent global brain&quot; idea.
