Strange.  You're the second one on this list to mention that they are
<br>
inflicted with a mild form of autism in the last couple weeks.
<br>
<p>[1] Carlo Wood said on April 1st: &quot;The diagnosis made when I was 20 was
<br>
that I had something &quot;related to autism&quot;, which pretty correct also in
<br>
regard to the fact that I experience &quot;reality&quot; in such a different way,
<br>
that others including the psychologist, never could comprehend it.&quot;
<br>
<p>The above sounds like Asperger's syndrome.
<br>
<p>[2] Max Comess said today: &quot; I've always had trouble in communicating,
<br>
in fact I have a DX'd communications disorder; Asperger's Syndrome.
<br>
Personally I'd rather DO something to bring the singularity about,
<br>
rather then just write about it, and since I don't have the knowledge to
<br>
write AI software, what I can do is attempt to inform people about what
<br>
is going on.&quot;
<br>
<p>Asperger's Syndrome is not really a communication disorder but a fairly
<br>
mild form of autism.  Those with Asperger's syndrome tend to exhibit
<br>
problems communicating because they fail to cognitively model the
<br>
intended recipient of the communication and thus therefore fail to
<br>
predict a potential negative response.
<br>
<p>Before this month I've really only run into one individual before with
<br>
this disorder -- a CTO at a company that I used to work for.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
