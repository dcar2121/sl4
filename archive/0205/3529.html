<p>
Will,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that a lot of what you say is true, when you think about it
<br>
in chronological terms. Unless someone develops a seed/emergent/Friendly AI
<br>
on their own, and it initiates a hard take off, I believe we will see what
<br>
you describe. In fact, I believe that this process is already beginning and
<br>
that we should do every thing in our power to help it along, thus my desire
<br>
for a Singularity consortium.
<br>
<p>However, I also believe that this process of intelligence amplification WILL
<br>
lead to a hard take off, because it will result in the creation of a seed
<br>
AI, either by emergence or design,  by the growing power that results from
<br>
combining many of the less intelligent &quot;unmotivated&quot; AI subsystems(e.g. cyc,
<br>
Newsblaster, etc) on massive distributed PFlop level nets, such as Altnet.
<br>
This process will either create an emergent AI, or it will allow the
<br>
developers who use this system to create true AI. The only question is HOW
<br>
QUICKLY will these elements combine, and I believe the answer will be
<br>
determined by how it is developed. Such systems can either be left to form
<br>
on their own, in a somewhat linear accretive fashion, or they can be
<br>
actively combined in a way that will create as many exponentially accretive
<br>
forward feedback processes as possible.  If we want the answer to be &quot;AS
<br>
SOON AS POSSIBLE.&quot;, we should favor the latter. This is why we need a
<br>
consortium.
<br>
<p>Exponential scenario:  Altnet as it could be.
<br>
<p>IF users are able to benefit directly from the increasing power of this
<br>
network, many more will join, faster, and it will become an accretive
<br>
accelerating process. If we want to grow this network and use it as a
<br>
platform to run IA, which will drive progress toward true AI, then it must
<br>
do several things:
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Provide incentives and benefits for users
<br>
in order to fuel growth of network. I cannot think of a more palpable and
<br>
immediate benefit to                                             joining
<br>
such a network then being able to use it's vast IA and AI resources.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Provide developers with a constantly
<br>
improving updated knowledge base that is run and managed by the very same IA
<br>
and AI software                                         they are
<br>
developing!!! This will create an &quot;intelligent platform&quot; upon which futher
<br>
advances can be developed. It's just serving the same
<br>
function as a say, a code library, but instead of being a passive database
<br>
of code, it's an active intelligent platform that is continually being
<br>
improved upon, and is constantly running, as a whole.... on a PFlop level
<br>
system.
<br>
<p>1 and 2 are essentially inseperable goals, because if we want to provide the
<br>
power to the network, we must provide a reason for people to supply that
<br>
power, and that reason is a powerful IA/AI system.
<br>
<p>In order to achieve 1 and 2, it almost goes without saying that this must be
<br>
a *dedicated* platform, devoting all of it's considerable
<br>
resources towards AI and IA. Essentially we have to take all these dumb AI
<br>
and IA programs that run relatively slow at a few GFlops on individual
<br>
computers, and combine them and run them at ~PFlops on one massive
<br>
distributed computer. Therefore the only way to make this thing work is to
<br>
make sure that these AI and IA apps actually have PFlops avialable to them,
<br>
thus a large portion, if not all, of this computer's resources must be
<br>
dedicated to running them.
<br>
<p>If these goals are implemented, then we should have a relatively powerful
<br>
and growing AI/IA system. Altnet is supposed to go online any day now, many
<br>
of these IA and AI subprograms already exist.... This can be implemented
<br>
NOW. If this system is created I believe that the Singularity will not be
<br>
long in coming, probably on the order of months.
<br>
<p><p><p>If, however; we succumb to our baser tribal instincts:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear Scenario: Altnet as currently envisioned.
<br>
<p>KaZaa generates plenty of new subscribers all the time, and probably many of
<br>
them will join Altnet. However Altnet will not generate much interest, nor
<br>
should it, if it is used only as outsourced computing resources so that
<br>
companies can save money. Altnet will not grow exponentially because *it*
<br>
will have no reason to. *Its* only purpose is to make money, and this is the
<br>
only incentive provided to the user.
<br>
<p>Therefore no outside projects. No selling to pharmas and biotechs! This has
<br>
to be determined right at the outset that the goal of Altnet is the
<br>
Singularity, not a quick profit for brilliantdigital. None of the magic can
<br>
happen if the PFlops aren't there to run the AI/IA.

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Anyway I think I don't have enough memes in common with this list to be
</em><br>
able to argue my points.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do believe that an increase in intelligence in the world will have a
</em><br>
major impact on what it means to be human. However I do not believe in the
<br>
hard take off. So even if you get a transhuman AI, unless it takes over the
<br>
whole internet, I don't believe it will go to super intelligence. Just my
<br>
beliefs, to explain why I am leaving. Here is my belief one last time, that
<br>
AI's without wills of their own interacting with humans controllers and each
<br>
other in a vast network of people will cause a meta-system transition/super
<br>
organism. Cross between web waking up and Intelligence augmentation.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good luck, I shall occaisionally look in the archives, and I get Kurweils
</em><br>
news letter, so undoubtably I will hear about the small breakthroughs you
<br>
make. If this movement makes the large breakthrough that you all hope for,
<br>
then the whole world will find out :)
<br>
