<em>&gt; The crossover point calculated was $3M given the original assumptions, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the $15M figure is for a 100 million mip cluster today.  I project that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2006, the cost for that performance will reach the economic crossover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point and be $3M.
</em><br>
<p>$3M was a figure Webmind could have afforded at its peak, and that Cycorp
<br>
could certainly afford, assuming a good enough reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding the marshalling of the required computional power I expect that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be most easily achieved via peer to peer over the net - a knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grid.  Given the expectation of beneficial results, computer owners could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; donate unused cycles.
</em><br>
<p>I used to be much more bullish on this option before I had a full AGI
<br>
design.
<br>
<p>According to the Novamente design (like the Webmind design before it),
<br>
though, the most intensive thought processing has really got to occur in a
<br>
pool of RAM on either one machine or a cluster of very tightly connected
<br>
machines (Ethernet, not cable modem or DSL).  Also, dealing with machines
<br>
that may go down at any time, or that may divert their processing power to
<br>
other things sporadically, is very expensive in terms of overhead (a lot of
<br>
monitoring is required, and a lot of redundancy).
<br>
<p>Thus, what we need for Novamente AGI is a large dedicated cluster or a
<br>
single ubercomputer.
<br>
<p>However, there are plenty of &quot;background thinking&quot; tasks that could
<br>
effectively be outsourced to a globally distributed P2P network of
<br>
relatively weak and unreliable machines.  We designed a very general
<br>
software framework called &quot;Webworld&quot; to support this, after surveying
<br>
existing frameworks for Internet distributed processing and finding them too
<br>
narrowly specialized.  Only a crude prototype of WebWorld was ever
<br>
implemented, though, and no one is working on that project at the moment (my
<br>
team is focusing our efforts more narrowly on core AGI and practical apps of
<br>
the in-progress codebase).
<br>
<p>I admit that this is a Novamente-centric perspective, and other AGI designs
<br>
could possibly use a P2P global network of home or office computers as their
<br>
primary computing substrate.  But I'll believe that when I hear a few
<br>
details about these hypothetical AGI designs ;&gt;
<br>
<p>Also, I understand that eventually we'll have fast Ethernet equivalent into
<br>
everybody's house, and at that point a globally distributed Novamente will
<br>
become more interesting.  But I'm not sure this is gonna advance as fast as
<br>
processor speed...
