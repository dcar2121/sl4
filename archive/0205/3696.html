<p>
It is far from impossible that the next big breakthrough in AI will be made
<br>
by some obscure team none of us has ever heard of.   I think it's unlikely
<br>
because I've made it my business to keep up on all published research that
<br>
has anything to do with AGI, and all significant industry efforts.  But of
<br>
course there could be someone at the University of Novosibirsk creating an
<br>
awesome AGI and publishing about it only in Russian, etc. etc.  there are
<br>
plenty of possibilities.
<br>
<p>One of the folks I met at IBM this week, Sam Adams (no relation to the
<br>
beverage ;) is working on a system very similar to Peter's A2I2 project.  He
<br>
is trying to create a reinforcement-learning based system (programmed in
<br>
smalltalk), that can build its own concepts from its perceptual experience
<br>
and direct its actions based on them.  He's first aiming to emulate
<br>
&quot;rat-like&quot; intelligence, working with a cognitive psychologist who studies
<br>
rat intelligence to design his tests.
<br>
<p>However, he prefers not to characterize his work as &quot;AI&quot;, calling it instead
<br>
&quot;building a system that learns human-like semantics from experience.&quot;   I
<br>
think it is perhaps not politic to call your work &quot;AI&quot; at most academic and
<br>
industry establishments right now.  This leads us to underestimate the
<br>
number of AGI projects going on, because there are plenty of people doing
<br>
work that is basically AGI oriented, but not inclined for various (often
<br>
career-oriented) reasons to explicitly characterize their work that way.
<br>
<p>The thing is that Sam's work is not well funded within IBM, it is very
<br>
important and interesting work but is pretty much a 1-man project with some
<br>
others giving advice.  There are loads of small-scale AGI efforts like this
<br>
in the world, and even I cannot keep track of them all in the limited time I
<br>
allocate to &quot;surveying the scene.&quot;  But it would be a lot harder for a
<br>
large-scale AGI effort to go by unnoticed.  My feeling is, at the point when
<br>
someone's small-scale AGI project (such as mine perhaps, altho mine is
<br>
larger scale than most!) achieves a big demonstrated success -- say, gets
<br>
halfway along the pathway to human-level AGI --  then everyone will know
<br>
about it....  So I don't think Singularity-launching-capable AGI is gonna
<br>
spring upon the world from an unknown source, because I think getting
<br>
halfway there is likely to attract a lot of attention....  Let's say Sam
<br>
Adams' project succeeded at getting to rat-level AGI.  Is IBM going to hush
<br>
this up?  Not at all likely, they would get WAY too much marketing pizzazz
<br>
from it, as they did from Deep Blue...
<br>
<p>As to why the Singularity is not better appreciated in mass society, that's
<br>
a whole other issue that I don't have time to chat about right now.
<br>
Obviously this is not the only example of &quot;mass blindness to the almost
<br>
obvious&quot; that we can find in human history or contemporary human society!!!

&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Re: Singularity Arrival Estimate - and other stories.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben, thanks for all the info.  I have no doubt that it is accurate.  As
<br>
for being half nuts or playing around, I do have a different view of reality
<br>
than most but I am quite rational.  I see ulterior motivations and
<br>
conspiracies everywhere I look.  And I am sometimes wrong.  I realize this,
<br>
so I tone it down some for this list.  I worry about ebola, tsunami, run
<br>
away green house, nano, intellecto, and of course the ants in my front yard
<br>
are plotting against me (got to get some more ant poison).  Still, I would
<br>
not be surprised to hear that the next big breakthrough in AI was made by
<br>
some team none of us had heard much about.  It strikes me as curious that if
<br>
we are not wackos, why are we so far outside the mainstream?  If the
<br>
Singularity is the biggest thing since sliced bread then why can't I find a
<br>
word about it on CNN.com?  The almost total lack of understanding by highly
<br>
intelligent societal and business leaders seems suspicious to me.  Maybe I s
<br>
hould send President Bush an e-mail, &quot;Hey George, how's the wife and kids?
<br>
By the way, THE END OF THE WORLD IS COMING!  Have you heard about the
<br>
Singularity?&quot;  Unfortunately, the last time I talked to him (May of 2001) I
<br>
hadn't heard about it yet myself.
