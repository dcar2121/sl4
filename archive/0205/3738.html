<em>&gt; Adequate for what? Generally, environment seems to lead to mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While the Net may have lots of data, it's a rather wonky world to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with bizarre rules. I would feel badly about an AI that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reflexively tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply a directory structure to concepts, the same way humans try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to organize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visual-spatially.
</em><br>
<p>Visio-spatial organization is useful but also limiting, and it is only one
<br>
among very  many possible ways to structure thoughts.
<br>
<p>I think Novamente *should* be given camera eyes someday.  However, I don't
<br>
think this is *necessary*, just a convenience.
<br>
<p>Indeed, the directory structure is limited, more so than the visuospatial
<br>
world.  What if an AI modeled part of its concept hierarchy on structures it
<br>
saw in chem and bio databases?  A lot of interesting metaphors there....
<br>
How about weather satellite data from around the world?  There is a lot more
<br>
richness of data on the Net than Web pages and directories.
<br>
<p>I fear that you're anthropomorphizing to a large degree, assuming that the
<br>
human perceptual-manipulative environment is somehow the best one...
<br>
<p>Maybe to an AI that grew up on the net, the spatially-limited perspective of
<br>
an individual human would seem terrifyingly, painfully limited... even
<br>
&quot;wonky&quot; as you say ;.&gt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I think you may be right. But my question is an eventual design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an initial one. I'm not arguing that environment needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; included, RIGHT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NOW. Just what level of complexity in environment is needed for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it all the way to AGI?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we have any theory adequate to tell us that, it must be
<br>
determined via experiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I have an intuition that mental organization is dependent on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what tools the AI has to interpret that. So an AI that lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might never work at all, because of insufficient environmental feedback.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, this is possible...
<br>
<p>Or, as I suspect, it might work VERY DIFFERENTLY than humans because of VERY
<br>
DIFFERENT environmental feedback!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, and about socialization. I agree Socialization is a huge part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. But it's not neccesarily a part of explicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment. I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk to people who aren't next to me. And there's no reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI can't use chat windows either. So I left such interaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploration of the subject because it can be dealt with without physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation.(or whatever the AI would call something it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relates to as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'real' object)
</em><br>
<p>I think that socialization requires more than a chat window; it requires
<br>
interaction with other minds in a shared perceivable/manipulable environment
<br>
<p>So I think that it is pretty  much on a par with the other things you
<br>
mention
<br>
<p>Not a critical point though!
