Hi all,
<br>
<p>I finally got around to reading some of Arthur T. Murray's stuff on the
<br>
Mentifex AI approach.
<br>
<p>I didn't look at the code (yet), I just read the docs on the site.
<br>
<p>If anyone is interested, these two are fairly clear and simple (esp. the
<br>
former)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/theory5.html">http://www.scn.org/~mentifex/theory5.html</a>
<br>
<p><a href="http://mentifex.virtualentity.com/theory4.html">http://mentifex.virtualentity.com/theory4.html</a>
<br>
<p>The &quot;Nolarbeit Theory Journal&quot; documents on the site, I found rather hard to
<br>
follow, although interesting in a literary and psychological sort of way.
<br>
<p>I like the simplified brain theory underlying the Mentifex system.  It is
<br>
really pretty similar to the brain theory I put forth in From Complexity to
<br>
Creativity (and earlier, in an article published in Complexity magazine):
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/books/complex/ch3.html">http://www.goertzel.org/books/complex/ch3.html</a>
<br>
<p>Had I known about the Mentifex work then, I would have cited it there....
<br>
Both theories use the hierarchical structure of the cortex, and connect it
<br>
to the dual-network-like structure of mind.  This stuff provides background
<br>
for my more recent work on hebbian logic -- hebbian logic is about reasoning
<br>
among neural clusters, and this is about how neural clusters work more
<br>
generally.
<br>
<p>However, my own AI work is not based on my theories about how the brain
<br>
works except in a very loose way.  Murray proposes an AI architecture based
<br>
more closely on his theory of the brain.
<br>
<p>He says a lot about how brain structure affects linguistic processing.  Here
<br>
I agree with most of his general conclusions about how linguistic structure
<br>
probably relates to brain structure and dynamics.  However, I doubt that
<br>
these general conclusions can be implemented simply in software.  I think
<br>
that the linguistic behaviors he discusses do come out of the brain
<br>
structures he mentions, but that there's a lot of detailed brain structure
<br>
and dynamics intervening between the two levels, which his software and
<br>
theory don't embody.  I could go into more details but don't have time right
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>In my view, although Arthur sometimes *presents* his ideas in a somewhat
<br>
kooky way (by the standards of the mainstream scientific community, and even
<br>
by the standards of this list), the ideas themselves are significantly
<br>
better than most of what passes for cognitive science and AI.  There is some
<br>
deep thinking there.  If anyone else but me is trying to survey all serious
<br>
thinking on AGI, Murray's two papers I cited above should be looked at for
<br>
sure.
<br>
