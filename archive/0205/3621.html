<!-- body="start" -->
<p>
A group of people are gathered around the base of an incredibly tall
<br>
mountain, thinking about how to get to the top.  Nearly all of them, except
<br>
a few dissenters, are convinced there's a spaceship on top of the mountain,
<br>
powered up and ready to take them to the stars.  The dissenters don't
<br>
believe in the spaceship, but think that ascending the mountain is a
<br>
valuable goal in itself.
<br>
<p>The path up is very hard and all sorts of new technologies are proposed to
<br>
help with the climbing.  Many people and groups have tried and failed to get
<br>
up, either dying along the way, or coming back down, defeated.  The whole
<br>
idea of climbing the  mountain has become a bit of a laughingstock among the
<br>
world at large -- and almost no one in the world at large believes in the
<br>
spaceship either.  No one has seen the spaceship directly but there are
<br>
solid logical reasons to believe it's there.
<br>
<p>X is a person who has been thinking about this mountain for about 20 years.
<br>
He led one expedition up, and they climbed about 4 years, but they ran out
<br>
of supplies and came back down.  X feels the path they were following was
<br>
almost right, but not quite; they veered off course about halfway up.  X
<br>
feels he could see the top from where he reached on his previous ascent,
<br>
though it was shrouded in mist.  X has gathered another team of climbers,
<br>
with new and better climbing technology, and is making another go at it.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Y has been thinking about the mountain for perhaps half as long,
<br>
or a little less.  Instead of leading expeditions up the mountain, however,
<br>
he prefers to sit at the base, and write treatises about the philosophy of
<br>
mountain climbing, climbing-equipment design, and the nature of the
<br>
spaceship at the top.  Each time someone attempts an ascent, he nods
<br>
knowingly and with an aura of wisdom beyond his years, &quot;You will fail to
<br>
reach the spaceship.  You have underestimated the difficulty of the task.
<br>
This is no mere ordinary mountain.  This is the mountain with the Great
<br>
Spaceship at the top!&quot;
<br>
<p>X says to Y: &quot;Yes, this is the mountain with the Great Spaceship at the top,
<br>
but nonetheless, it's just a mountain.  Climb up it yourself, you'll see.
<br>
Eventually it will yield to sufficiently persistent and intelligent climbing
<br>
techniques.&quot;
<br>
<p>Y says: &quot;You know nothing about this mountain.  Your measly experiences
<br>
trying to climb it count for nothing.&quot;
<br>
<p>X says: &quot;But we were pretty damn close... we could see the top up ahead ...
<br>
we were just blocked by this outcropping of boulders...&quot;
<br>
<p>Y says: &quot;You were nowhere near the top.  No one has ever come near the top.
<br>
It is vain to attempt to climb to the top without a vastly more
<br>
sophisticated and complicated array of climbing equipment, and a science of
<br>
climbing technique 100 times more complicated than yours.&quot;
<br>
<p>X says: &quot;Well, you could be right.  On the other hand, how do you know?
<br>
You've barely ever ventured beyond the foothills.&quot;
<br>
<p>Y says: &quot;Nor have you; you have just mistaken the upper foothills for the
<br>
real mountain.  And furthermore, it is an insult to me and to the mountain
<br>
and the spaceship that you are telling people you are heading for the
<br>
spaceship.  You are not heading for the spaceship any more than I am, by
<br>
simply sitting here and philosophizing.  Compared with the ultimate high
<br>
peak of the mountain, your toying around in the foothills is no progress at
<br>
all.  You might as well save yourself the effort and stay here sitting on
<br>
your butt, and focus on designing better climbing techniques and 100 times
<br>
more complicated equipment, so you can make a *real* climbing effort at some
<br>
point in the future!  Prematurely moving onto the climbing phase is nothing
<br>
to be proud of.&quot;
<br>
<p>X says: &quot;It's not an insult to anything to say we're heading for the
<br>
spaceship at the top of the mountain.  We are.  Maybe we won't get there,
<br>
but we're making an honest effort, and we don't think you understand the
<br>
real power of our climbing techniques and our special equipment.  They may
<br>
seem too simple to you, but our experience teaches us that there is power in
<br>
simplicity.  Overly complex techniques and equipment are really problematic
<br>
in ways you don't see yet because you've never tried to actually climb the
<br>
mountain in any serious way.  And we thought a long time about how to do it
<br>
before setting off climbing -- there was nothing hasty or premature about
<br>
it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Y says: &quot;If you have all this experience, why don't you share it.  Spend a
<br>
few years drawing us maps of the path you took.  Convince us that you really
<br>
got beyond the lower foothills.&quot;
<br>
<p>X says: &quot;Drawing maps takes a lot of time and effort, and the people who
<br>
built our equipment for us might well sue us if we drew overly detailed
<br>
maps....  And not many people would believe us one way or the other.  Hell,
<br>
most people don't believe in the spaceship, and most people believe the
<br>
mountain is intrinsically unscaleable.  We're going back up.  See ya!&quot;
<br>
<p>Y: &quot;You will fail!  You will fail!&quot;
<br>
<p>X: &quot;And you will continue to sit on your butt!!&quot;
<br>
<p>Y gets to the top.  He sees the spaceship.  But a moment before he gets to
<br>
it, the alien sitting in it revvs up the motor and flies away.
<br>
<p>Y shrugs.  He enjoyed the climb.  He and his team take out the parasails
<br>
they have in their backpacks and leap off the mountain, enjoying the ride of
<br>
their lives ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>The End -- or The Beginning --
