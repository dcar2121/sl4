<p>
I generally agree with Ben's response to Eli's review.
<br>
<p>Specifically, I agree that Real AI (including Seed AI) will require a
<br>
simpler, cleaner design rather than the kind of complexity that Eli seems to
<br>
call for. Really understanding what general intelligence is, and what its
<br>
essentials are, is the key to an effective implementation.
<br>
<p>Unlike Novamente, the a2i2 approach focuses on the basic cognitive
<br>
mechanisms that lead to high-level thought (including reasoning &amp; formal
<br>
logic). We firmly believe that dog-level ('general') intelligence is an
<br>
extremely significant step towards human-level AGI. In fact, we take this to
<br>
be the real hurdle. This view is based on significant research, and is more
<br>
than a vague intuition.
<br>
<p>Anyway - back to work....

<p><p>-----Original Message-----
<br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; My overall reaction is that Novamente is much, much simpler than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visualizing from Ben's descriptions;
</em><br>
<p>Actually we have been explicitly *striving* for simplicity.  Webmind was
<br>
more complex with  more functionally specialized parts.  I look at the
<br>
greater simplicity of Novamente as an advantage.  Of course, the design is
<br>
highly flexible so that we can create greater specialization if it's needed.
<br>
<p>This is a philosophical difference however.  You seem to believe that an AI
<br>
design has to be very complicated.  I think Novamente is still too
<br>
complicated, and that in a good design, a heck of a lot of the complexity of
<br>
mind should emerge rather than being part of the explicit design.   Of
<br>
course the design has to be made with the proper sorts of emergence
<br>
explicitly in mind, and one of the many shortcomings of the current
<br>
Novamente manuscript version is that it doesn't focus on this enough.
<br>
....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; However, from my perspective, Novamente has very *simple* behaviors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference, attention, generalization, and evolutionary programming.
</em><br>
<p>We have tried to simplify these basic cognitive processes as much as
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>The complexity of cognition is intended to emerge from the self-organizing
<br>
interaction of the right set of simple processes on a large set of
<br>
information.  NOT from complexity of the basic behaviors.
<br>
...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Novamente does not have the complexity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would render
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these problems tractable; the processes may intersect in a common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation but the processes themselves are generic.
</em><br>
<p>If by &quot;generic&quot; you mean that Novamente's basic cognitive processes are not
<br>
functionally specialized, you are correct.
<br>
<p>And I think this is as it should be.
<br>
...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if Novamente's current behaviors can give rise to full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognition at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher levels of organization, it would make Novamente a mind so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alien that it would make a human and a Friendly AI look like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cousins.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree, if Novamente becomes a mind it will be a very alien mind.  We
<br>
are not trying to emulate human intelligence, not at all.  Equal and
<br>
surpass, but not emulate.
<br>
<p>To emulate human intelligence on a digital computer, we need: a) way bigger
<br>
computers, b) way  more understanding of how the brain works.
<br>
<p>The only hope for the short run, in my view, is to seek to build a very
<br>
alien intelligence, one that exploits the unique power of digital computers
<br>
rather than trying to emulate the brain and its dynamics in any detail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels of Novamente were designed with the belief that these lower levels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in themselves, implemented cognition, not with the intent that these low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; levels should support higher levels of organization.
</em><br>
<p>This is completely untrue.  You were not there when we designed these
<br>
levels, so how on Earth can you make this presumption??
<br>
<p>I spent the 8 years before starting designing Webmind, writing books and
<br>
paper on self-organization and emergence in the mind.  (See especially
<br>
Chaotic Logic and From Complexity to Creativity)
<br>
<p>OF COURSE, I did not design the lower levels of the system without the
<br>
emergence of a higher level of structure and dynamics as a key goal.
<br>
<p>PV: Ditto
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the standards I would apply to real AI, Novamente is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecturally very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple and is built around a relative handful of generic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors; I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that Novamente as it stands can support Ben's stated goals of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general intelligence, seed AI, or even the existence of substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence on higher levels of organization.
</em><br>
<p>You are right: Novamente is architecturally relatively simple and is built
<br>
around a relative handful of generic behaviors.
<br>
<p>It is not all THAT simple of course: it will definitely be 100,000-200,000
<br>
lines of C++ code when finished, and it involves around 20 different mental
<br>
dynamics.  But it is a lot simpler than Eliezer would like.  And I think its
<br>
*relative* simplicity is a good thing.
<br>
<p>I suspect that an AI system with 200 more specialized mental dynamics,
<br>
rather than 20 generic ones, would be effectively impossible for a team of
<br>
humans to program, debug and test.  So: Eliezer, I think that IF you're
<br>
right about the level of complexity needed (which I doubt), THEN Kurzweil is
<br>
also right that the only viable approach to real AI is to emulate human
<br>
brain-biology in silico.  Because I think that implementing a system 10
<br>
times more complex than Novamente via software engineering rather than
<br>
brain-emulation is not going to be feasible.
