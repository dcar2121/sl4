A comment on the relation between A2I2 and Novamente.
<br>
<p>They are both founded on a &quot;self-organizing network&quot; design.  They are both
<br>
a bit more high-level and abstract than neural network models.  They are
<br>
both much simpler than Eliezer thinks an AGI should be, and they both rely
<br>
too much on self-organization and emergence to fit neatly and naturally into
<br>
Eliezer's &quot;Friendly goal system&quot; framework.
<br>
<p>However, Novamente tries to incorporate the best aspects of
<br>
semantic-net/logic based AI with the best aspects of neural net based AI,
<br>
whereas A2I2 is lower-level, and I view it *very loosely* more as &quot;trying to
<br>
get something a little more mind-ish and abstract the neural nettish
<br>
approach right&quot;.  Novamente has many more mind-dynamics going on; it's a lot
<br>
more complex than A2I2 (which I view as a bad thing, but I intuitively
<br>
believe this level of complexity is going to make the task of getting real
<br>
general intelligence to emerge a lot easier).
<br>
<p>My worry with A2I2 is that, after they build their digital doggie (or mouse,
<br>
or roach, or whatever -- obviously there is no exact animal correlate, it's
<br>
not that kind of project), *will their structures and dynamics scale* to the
<br>
next level, the level of a more general inteligence with abstract thinking
<br>
capabilities??
<br>
<p>Peter's intuition is that they will.  My intuition is that I'm not so sure,
<br>
but I think they may have a fighting chance.  They may, in my view, have a
<br>
lot of rethinking and new designing to do, to make the leap from a digital
<br>
sort-of-animal to something at all capable of abstract thought.
<br>
<p>All in all I think it's a really cool project with a lot of promise.  A hell
<br>
of a lot more exciting, and important, than typical AI research which is
<br>
aimed at solving some narrow problem.  A2I2 is making a system that will be
<br>
capable at least of simple animal-level &quot;experiential interactive learning&quot;.
<br>
And I hope they can push it further...

<em>&gt; Subject: Review of A2I2
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In reviewing Peter Voss's A2I2 I'm working with much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have for Ben Goertzel's Novamente.  My review of Novamente is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading the Novamente manuscript and having extensive conversations with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ben; my review of A2I2 is based on seeing part of a demo at the Foresight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gathering before I had to leave for the airport (aaargh!), which hopefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was enough to give me a glimpse of the underlying architecture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plus various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bits of surrounding information, a few small exchanges with Voss,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Unlike Ben with Novamente, Peter Voss has not, as far as I know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expressed a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief that A2I2's current architecture is adequate to general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or seed AI; Voss's philosophy of AI is that you start by building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mouse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay.  Not my personal approach but not an invalid approach either.  After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing the demo my reaction was again that A2I2 was simpler than I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected, but that could just be because it was a demo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I saw in the demo was an AI with a visual grid operating at multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scales of resolution, and a network of nodes in which each node
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a visual pattern.  When A2I2 runs across a visual pattern it hasn't seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before - a visual pattern below a defined threshold of similarity to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing nodes - it creates a new node.  Parts of A2I2 explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as being absent from the demo include A2I2's ability to issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motor actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a reinforcement system that links perceptions to actions.  (&quot;Visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern&quot; and &quot;motor action&quot; means A2I2 is bouncing around in the visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment of a 2D microworld, not that it's a robot.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess my overall reaction is that this is fine as far as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes, but I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sure what Voss plans to do with it when it's finished.  Build a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Norn?
</em><br>
