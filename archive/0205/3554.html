<em>&gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is my take on these things, which is not the same as Eliezer's of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As anyone who has worked with complex nonlinear dynamical systems knows,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicting the stability of a complex system from first principles is a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard problem.  There is a very high probability that our intuitions about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these things are going to be wrong.  All we are giving are heuristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments.  Heuristic arguments about weather systems and their stability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were quite popular, until in the 70's Lorenz's older work on chaotic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dynamics in weather systems became well-known.  Now that we know there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some chaos there, we still can't make detailed predictions of the stability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or other dynamical properties of given weather systems.  I suspect that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real study of stability and other dynamical properties of goal systems will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not begin until we have AI's of, say, chimp intelligence to experiment with.
</em><br>
<p>Is a complex nonlinear dynamical system really the right way to look at a
<br>
Friendly AI?  This is an intelligent being we're talking about, capable of
<br>
making choices.  The Singularity is not a complex nonlinear dynamical
<br>
process - it is alive; there is an intelligence, in fact a transhuman
<br>
intelligence, standing behind it and making choices.  You can't create
<br>
Friendly AI by blindly expecting it to be intelligent and alive; that
<br>
intelligence and aliveness is part of what you're creating, which means that
<br>
you need to understand &quot;intelligence&quot; and &quot;alive&quot; in terms other than our
<br>
simple percepts.  But you also can't create Friendly AI by thinking of it as
<br>
a complex nonlinear dynamical system.  If, when you've created Friendly AI
<br>
through your design understanding, someone with a surface understanding
<br>
looks at the system and says:  &quot;Oh, look, a self-modifying goal system that
<br>
follows a complex nonlinear dynamic,&quot; instead of &quot;Oh, look, a mind that
<br>
understands philosophy and is trying to improve itself,&quot; then you've screwed
<br>
up the job completely.
<br>
<p>If you see the process of a mind improving itself as randomly drifting, then
<br>
you won't be able to create Friendly AI because you won't be looking at the
<br>
forces that make it more than random drift.
<br>
<p>I'm really stuck in a horrible double bind when explaining Friendly AI.  On
<br>
one hand, to really understand Friendly AI requires standing outside of our
<br>
emotional attachment to the human architecture of morality, which means that
<br>
I shouldn't invoke moral arguments to explain Friendly AI - you can't *use*
<br>
moral arguments to create a Friendly AI unless you already *have* a Friendly
<br>
AI that listens to moral arguments.  To acquire understanding of Friendly AI
<br>
at a level sufficient to create it, you have to step outside of all
<br>
analogies - and by &quot;analogies&quot; I mean domain mappings in the
<br>
Lakoff-and-Johnson sense; you can't think about the Friendly AI by expecting
<br>
it to behave like something else of which you have had experience, because
<br>
in creating Friendly AI, you are transferring that which is necessary to the
<br>
behaviors you want to map.
<br>
<p>Lakoff and Johnson have a standard notation in which capital letters
<br>
indicate a metaphor; &quot;an angry human is A CONTAINER UNDER PRESSURE&quot;; &quot;time
<br>
is a CONSERVED RESOURCE&quot;.  This doesn't come across very well in email but
<br>
it's better than nothing.  Anyway...
<br>
<p>The intuitive analogic of &quot;creating Friendly AI is CREATING YOUR PERSONAL
<br>
PHILOSOPHY&quot; is much stronger and more useful than the metaphors &quot;creating
<br>
Friendly AI is COMMANDING A HUMAN&quot; or &quot;creating a Friendly AI is BUILDING A
<br>
TOOL WITH A DESIGN PURPOSE&quot;.  But to actually succeed in creating Friendly
<br>
AI you can't afford to use *any* of these metaphors, because they expect
<br>
behaviors that are not automatic.  And if you know what it is that creates
<br>
these behaviors, you shouldn't need analogies to understand them; you should
<br>
understand them on their own terms.  If the Friendly AI engineers do their
<br>
job, &quot;A Friendly AI reasoning about morality is AN IDEALIZED HUMAN REASONING
<br>
ABOUT MORALITY&quot; is a much better analogy than &quot;a Friendly AI reasoning about
<br>
morality is AN ALGORITHM PRODUCING AN OUTPUT&quot; or &quot;a Friendly AI reasoning
<br>
about morality is A NONLINEAR DYNAMIC SYSTEM&quot;.  But to actually *build*
<br>
Friendly AI, the only appropriate and useful metaphor is &quot;A Friendly AI
<br>
reasoning about morality is A FRIENDLY AI REASONING ABOUT MORALITY.&quot;
