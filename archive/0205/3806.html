the

are a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; great deal of narrow minded people in the government/military sector,
</em><br>
who
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And Eliezar responded
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that military officers - US military, at least - are that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evil. &gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;US military officers are not evil as a rule. When they are evil it's
<br>
generally a petty little sort of evil, the sort that enjoys humilating
<br>
others, turf-protection, and harassing the folks in their vicinity who
<br>
are insufficently cynical about what it all means. Most officers are
<br>
just people.. they have to fight traffic and buy diapers like everyone
<br>
else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If they misinterpreted a Singularity project as a threat to the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the world, then yes, they wouldn't take it well, as is only natural.
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that as long as you
<br>
&nbsp;1. stay in the continental US (i.e. Atlanta is a good town)
<br>
&nbsp;2. don't discuss selling seed AI to China or someone.
<br>
&nbsp;3. explain the Singularity as an extension of familar concepts rather than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something truly new under the sun, and stress the inherent pacifism of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the idea (which you seem to do well)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then I really can't see any US military officer creating more work for
<br>
themselves by interfering.  The instant reaction of any &quot;real&quot; officer would
<br>
be &quot;Could this Sysop thing possibly reduce my paperwork?&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that if the typical officer in the US military saw a real chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ending war forever, they would see this as a *very* good thing, not a
</em><br>
career
<br>
<em>&gt; threat.  To the extent that people are narrow-minded, they are likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miss out on the possibility of a real upheaval entirely, seeing the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue in terms of an ordinary technological revolution instead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of ending war forever is a laughable notion to serious Line
<br>
officers, however attractive the notion. They read too much Kipling
<br>
for the gods of the marketplace to be persuasive. Talk about
<br>
ending terrorism.. that might be more plausible to them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as missing the possibility of real upheaval.. yes, this is
<br>
well said Eli.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides...military officers are used to things happening slowly.
<br>
Large bureacracies are like this. My advice on this thread?
<br>
&nbsp;Be vaguely loyal and don't worry about the DoD unless you're
<br>
&nbsp;contemplating them as a funding scource.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficent unto the day are the hassles thereof.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
