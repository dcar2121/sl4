<em>&gt;Actually there ARE (at least a few) SL3 types on the list who are 
</em><br>
polite
<br>
<em>&gt;and understand the concept of not spitting in the sandbox everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else is playing in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I happen to be one of them.
</em><br>
<p>Perfectly acceptable, I'm sure everyone agrees with me on that...but 
<br>
any lower than SL3 should go read a bit first, in my opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Honestly, how many people on this list can seriously claim to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand the programming and cognitive science Eli and Ben throw 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around, at least well enough to know if they have even a remote chance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of success?
</em><br>
<p>Good point - I don't think any of us really do, that's why I wish Ben 
<br>
and Eli would help direct us into the right areas of study and thought 
<br>
to ever so slightly bridge the gap in knowledge between &quot;us and them&quot;.  
<br>
I've started reading what Eli recommended in his interview, I hope to 
<br>
read MITECS within the next year, but I really think the 
<br>
Singularitarian community as a whole would benefit if some people were 
<br>
tutored in the semi-technical aspects of AI, so they would have 
<br>
stronger arguments against Singularity naysayers.  But since Eli and 
<br>
Ben are very, very busy, the first group will have to start off by 
<br>
teaching themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Which is more important,finishing my education and entering a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lucrative profession (a fairly &quot;sure thing&quot; so to speak)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or entering a Ph.D. program in cogsci so I can really figure out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether Friendliness is a pile of semantic horseshit or a Truly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brilliant Idea?
</em><br>
<p>Which is more important, a human job making money in a human world 
<br>
buying human toys, or the Singularity?  Even if your model of choice is 
<br>
a slow takeoff, and long as you believe it will be possible to build an 
<br>
AI in the relatively near future (10ish years?), then your worldview 
<br>
should be quite different than that of the average technophile.  Just 
<br>
look at the numbers in Moore's Law - that's a damn powerful argument 
<br>
right there, in my opinion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Point being I don't claim to be a Singularitarian 
</em><br>
<p>You don't claim to be a Singularitarian in the &quot;Singularitarian 
<br>
Principles&quot; sense?  The Singularitarian Principles encompass a large 
<br>
field of potential adherents; you don't have to advocate an AI 
<br>
Singularity, or a hard takeoff, to be a Singularitarian in that sense.  
<br>
But of course, some of us have different standards for what we 
<br>
call &quot;SL4&quot; or &quot;Singularitarian&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Not to be a prick but &quot;memetic engineering&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and &quot;PR&quot; is a fine excuse not to work your ass off, at least for most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;folks.
</em><br>
<p>There's a horrible lack of material on the Singularity out there - we 
<br>
need more web pages, we need more papers, we need more interviews, we 
<br>
need more spreading of the meme(s), we need to greatly expand the 
<br>
current pool of Singularitarians, and do so intelligently and 
<br>
carefully.  These are huge, extremely important tasks for anyone who 
<br>
can't work on AI or move to Atlanta at the moment.  They are not easy, 
<br>
either.  What's more worthwhile, spending your time, on, say, watching 
<br>
a couple of hours of TV, or practicing your Singularity writing 
<br>
skills?  Which would humanity appreciate more?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I would expect you to be trying to understand CATAI at least well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough to try to catch Eli's mistakes.  But that isn't the sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traffic that permeates this &quot;SL 4&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I would expect everyone on this list to find the time to read CFAI, 
<br>
GISAI, and LOGI and *try* to understand them.  It really doesn't take 
<br>
that long to read them once, at least.  If everyone on this list did 
<br>
that, I would expect a lot more conversation about these papers, and 
<br>
frankly, it bothers me a lot that there isn't conversation already.  I 
<br>
want to keep making the point to people, Singularitarianism shouldn't 
<br>
just be a hobby, like how I think Extropianism is to a lot of people.   
<br>
A true Singularitarian not only understands the importance of the 
<br>
Singularity, but behaves accordingly.  This means spreading the meme.  
<br>
If everyone on this list with an hour of spare time per day started 
<br>
visiting a philosophy forum and diligently and carefully explained the 
<br>
concept of the Singularity to a few open-minded and intelligent people, 
<br>
we could double the pool of existing Singularitarians within 2 months, 
<br>
minimum, I'd wager.  One person can make a difference in the 
<br>
Singularity, *especially* at the stage of development that we're at 
<br>
now.  I'm not telling anyone to do anything they don't feel like doing, 
<br>
but just to be aware of the potential each of us has to truly make a 
<br>
difference in a way that few humans have ever before had an opportunity 
<br>
to make a difference.
