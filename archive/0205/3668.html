<p>
<em>&gt;  More basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science in the fields of computer science, nanotechnology, and AI has come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of IBM than any other single place in the world.  IBM has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have 50 Novamente projects going on in secret.
</em><br>
<p><p>I happen to be AT IBM right now, in Yorktown Heights.  I have been meeting
<br>
with a number of their computer scientists, in the context of a conference
<br>
on &quot;autonomic computing&quot;.
<br>
<p>The fact is, they laid off most of their AI staff in the mid-90's, keeping
<br>
only those who were willing to work on very narrow-focused AI projects.
<br>
They have a handful of staff working on AGI-related stuff, individually and
<br>
without an overall plan, with almost no funding ... most of them spending
<br>
half or more of their time on non-AGI stuff.
<br>
<p>The few staff they have working on AGI stuff, individually and in their
<br>
spare time, are not too happy with the situation.
<br>
<p>Sure, all these staff scientists could be lying to me, or could be unaware
<br>
of the top-secret AGI projects going on, but it's amazingly unlikely.  The
<br>
public record of their hirings and layoffs and quittings supports the story
<br>
told by their staff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You think the Deep Blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; II beating Garry was a parlor trick?  I happen to be a chess master and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can tell you that what happened there was amazing.  It is often sited the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billions of moves per second that DB was checking, as if it beat Garry by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pure brute force.  Garry went into that match knowing that you can't beat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Garry that way.  Garry threw a fit and accused the IBM team of cheating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?  Because DB thought beyond the board, simulating Garry himself, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used a psychological ploy to trick Garry into making a bad move and losing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the game.  There was much more going on in that program than chess.
</em><br>
<p>I know some of the people who worked on Deep Blue.  What you say is not at
<br>
all accurate.  Deep Blue used min-max search with alpha-beta pruning, and a
<br>
clever heuristic evaluation function created and tuned by some chess
<br>
experts, all implemented on specialized hardware.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't count Bill Gates out either.  M$ has it's own AI research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; department which they claim is doing GOFAI.  It probably is doing some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that along with the real work.  Nor would I discount Japan, Australia, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifty universities around the world.  Underground AI is BIG BIG
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BIG!
</em><br>
<p>You are simply dead WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!  M$ does not have a significant AGI
<br>
research program, and neither do any major US universities.  You can see
<br>
this, for example, by studying M$'s hiring patterns.  they have hired
<br>
extensively in areas like graphics and bayes nets but not AGI.  As for
<br>
universities, all uni research is funded by gov't grants, and the NSF and
<br>
other gov't programs have not funded AGI research significantly for decades.
<br>
<p>Australia has no significant AGI research, at any of their major
<br>
universities,not even the ANU.
<br>
<p>Japan's biggest AI effort is at ATR, but they reorganized a couple years
<br>
back.  Hugo de Garis moved to Belgium and Katsunori Shimohara's Human
<br>
Information Processing Lab was renamed and reorganized; advanced AI is on
<br>
the outs there, they're mostly into moderately-intelligent robotics...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kurzweil's charts because they are data points and not as subject to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservativization.  But his formula is purposely biased to the future.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think he knows it's coming in 2005 but doesn't want anyone else to know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His prediction of 2005 - 2030 is to make people think it is longer while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving his ability to not be proven wrong.  He wants to a let people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that would be in favor of the Singularity know that it is coming but he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't want to alert the enemy how soon.  What would happen in January of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2005 if CNN, started broadcasting that experts predicted the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; four months?  Mass panic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prediction: April 28, 2005.
</em><br>
<p>Not to be too blunt about it, but I think either you're half-nuts or you're
<br>
just playing around ;&gt;
<br>
<p>It's not your prediction in itself that makes me say this, it's the
<br>
dead-wrong reasoning underlying it.
<br>
<p>The pattern of top-secret AGI research that you cite simply does not exist.
<br>
if there are such top-secret programs they are not at M$, IBM or
<br>
universities, they would have to be deep within the NSA or CIA or
<br>
something... and there is no evidence to suggest this at all (e.g. no hiring
<br>
of AGI PhD's by such agencies).
<br>
<p>I think a Singularity by 2010 is *possible*.  If Novamente or A2I2 or
<br>
Mentifex or NARS or DGI some other AI project goes *really well*, this could
<br>
happen.   Not impossible, and I hope it happens.
<br>
<p>But given the current state and pace of development of the various known AGI
<br>
projects, and the incredible unlikelihood of advanced unknown projects of
<br>
this nature, 2005 is incredibly unlikely.
