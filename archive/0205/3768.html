</em><br>
<p>Based upon the &quot;Good Old Fashioned AI&quot; notion that a commonsense KB, and a
<br>
robust N-Order logical language is the foundation for an AI, Cycorp:
<br>
<p>1. is investing in strengthening its deductive inference engine, adding
<br>
user-friendly knowledge acquistion tools in the Darpa RKF project, 
<br>
<p>2. is extending Cyc's understanding of structured knowledge sources in the
<br>
Darpa DAML project and in another government SBIR grant.  
<br>
<p>3. in the Darpa EELD project we are providing the reference ontology
<br>
(vocabulary) that will enable collaborator's text information extraction
<br>
tools to discover relationships among entities in the counter-terrorism
<br>
domain.
<br>
<p>Our first product, Cyc-Secure, uses Cyc's planner to identify possible
<br>
ways an adversary can compromise a government or enterprise network. This
<br>
product is in use at a strategic military facility.
<br>
<p>Although the shortcomings of semantic nets are well described in Elizer's
<br>
writings, we are reviewing the entire Cyc ontology, starting at the top as
<br>
it gets released into OpenCyc.  We do make the distinction between
<br>
internal programming object and external referent.  We acknowledge that
<br>
the average of 10 assertions per term is very far short of what an AI
<br>
needs to know about a concept.
<br>
<p>What Cyc has:
<br>
<p>1. Over 100,000 terms arranged in a single rooted generalization hierarchy
<br>
permitting fast subsumption reasoning.
<br>
<p>2. Over 10,000 relationships arranged in generalization hierarchies,
<br>
permitting precise assertions of over 1 million facts in a hierarchy of
<br>
contexts.
<br>
<p>3. A robust N-order deductive inference engine that has sacrificed the
<br>
ability to get an answer for certain, for the full expressiveness of
<br>
N-order predicate calculus vocabulary.  That is, you can describe a set of
<br>
facts and rules to Cyc to answer questions, but Cyc may not be able to
<br>
answer your question.
<br>
<p>4. Full support for functional notation.  It is not necessary to name
<br>
every concept of interest.  CycL's functional notation allows composition
<br>
to refer to concepts, without explicit reification (naming).
<br>
<p>5. The GUI tools for Ontological Engineers (non-programming logic
<br>
experts) to manipulate and query the KB.
<br>
<p>6. A growing set of GUI tools for Subject Matter Experts (SME's) to
<br>
interact with Cyc via clarification dialog.
<br>
<p>7. A lexicon of 10,000 English Language terms linked to Cyc concepts,
<br>
allowing Cyc to parse some simple sentences, and to generate English
<br>
language sentences corresponding to each of its assertions.
<br>
<p>8. An embedded version of WordNet 1.6, the well-known lexical database.
<br>
<p>9. A robust blackboard for agent interaction.
<br>
<p>10. A planner adapted from the open-source UMBC SHOP planner.
<br>
<p><p>What Cyc does not (yet) have:
<br>
<p>1. Reinforcement learning.
<br>
<p>2. Goal directed behavior.
<br>
<p>3. Self-initiated tasks,
<br>
<p>4. Robust NL understanding.
<br>
<p>5. Fuzzy logic inference, although CycL can represent Fuzzy lexical terms.
<br>
<p>6. Self-modifying code.
<br>
<p>7. many other aspects of AI....
<br>
<p>Regarding Seed AI, Cycorp researchers (naturally) believe that the KB is
<br>
the key (so that some time in the future):
<br>
<p>1. Extend Cyc's vocabulary to represent its own behavior.
<br>
<p>2. Introduce Cyc behavior governed by KB content.
<br>
<p>3. Elaborate that behavior to create the Seed AI.
<br>
<p>All of the above will be included in OpenCyc for you to examine, review,
<br>
and extend.
<br>
<p>OpenCyc can inter-operate with other AI systems via its java api, and via
<br>
CycML - the serialization of CycL in XML.  OpenCyc is freely
<br>
distributable, and you could embed it within a AI software system of your
<br>
own design.
<br>
<p>One motivation for publishing OpenCyc is to encourage one reference
<br>
vocabulary for representing commonsense knowledge.  In this forum I am
<br>
especially interested in the vocabulary required to share knowledge among
<br>
the AI systems planned or under development.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
