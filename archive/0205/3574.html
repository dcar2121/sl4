<p><em>&gt;What is it that differentiates &quot;justice&quot; from &quot;revenge&quot; if not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justification of maintaining order in a community?
</em><br>
<p>Justice may have a role in the proper functioning of a society, but that's
<br>
not what I am referring to here.  I see justice as of value itself.  I want
<br>
to live in a universe that is not &quot;evil&quot;.  That leaves &quot;good&quot; or &quot;morally
<br>
balanced&quot;.  I quote these terms because I realize they are going to require
<br>
some explanation to separate them from their religious historical context.
<br>
I am not advocating any religious philosophy (I don't personally to any).  I
<br>
think these terms are more basic than any religion.  I think they are the
<br>
reason many people seek out religion.  I person directly feels these
<br>
concepts (not in a metaphysical sense) and looks for an explanation or a
<br>
framework to understand them.  Consequently many people are vulnerable to
<br>
deception by those who would use these concepts for their own purposes.
<br>
When you observe some action or activity that is good it makes you feel
<br>
good, and vice versa.  When you observe someone doing irreversible serious
<br>
harm to another not deserving it, you feel bad and want to make it right and
<br>
that will make you feel better.  But here is the important part:  The reason
<br>
you feel bad is you observe that the universe is out of balance.  There is a
<br>
stain of evil on it which must be removed for the universe to return to
<br>
balance.  Because you know that if it is not corrected and if more stains
<br>
accumulate that the universe will become an evil place.  And the more evil
<br>
it becomes the easier it is for evil actions to take place.  And of course,
<br>
the more evil actions the worse you feel.  It sounds kind of circular but
<br>
it's not an explanation, it's reality, and reality is often circular.  We
<br>
have all felt this.  Case in point:  we hear that someone has tortured and
<br>
murdered a young child,  we feel that the universe is out of balance and
<br>
needs to be made right.  The word for this is justice.  It's not for
<br>
society, not for the victims, not for us, it's for the universe.
<br>
<p>Why do I care if you don't share my ideas about justice?  Because you are
<br>
writing the code of the friendliness system of the first AI.  You are going
<br>
to be training it in friendliness, and testing it against your moral system.
<br>
Your moral character is of prime importance to all of us.  It is an issue.

<p><em>&gt;Does asking you not to hate really make me hateful?  Saying that I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harmfully wrong is one thing.  But that it makes me a bad person?  Do you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I find myself in the uncomfortable position of needing to apologize.  I
<br>
don't hate you.  I'm sorry if I gave that impression.  I admire you.  I
<br>
respect you.  I wish I were you (in the sense that I wish I had the freedom
<br>
from commitments to be able to dedicate my life to this noble cause.)
