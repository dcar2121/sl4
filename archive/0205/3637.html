<em>&gt; Meanwhile, Y has been thinking about the mountain for perhaps half as long,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; he prefers to sit at the base, and write treatises about the philosophy of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mountain climbing, climbing-equipment design, and the nature of the
</em><br>

<em>&gt; knowingly and with an aura of wisdom beyond his years, &quot;You will fail to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach the spaceship.  You have underestimated the difficulty of the task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is no mere ordinary mountain.  This is the mountain with the Great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spaceship at the top!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I am trying to gather an expedition, please note.  While waiting to collect
<br>
the funding for the expedition, I am doing as much advance work as possible
<br>
at the base to prepare for the ascent.  Occasionally someone comes up and
<br>
says cheerily:  &quot;What's with all this preparation?  Why haven't you gotten
<br>
started yet?  This mountain looks quite easy; you ought to be able to climb
<br>
it on your own.  Why, I'm setting out on this trip with nothing but a Kevlar
<br>
tent and a backpack of X-Men comics.&quot;  And *that* is the point when I launch
<br>
into my the-mountain-is-bigger-than-that speech.
<br>
<p>The total amount of time we have respectively been thinking about the
<br>
mountain is as irrelevant as our respective degrees of commitment; if you
<br>
think that your total time expended has resulted in a better theory, then
<br>
you should be able to win simply by defending the better theory without
<br>
needing to refer to time spent.
<br>
<p>If the people climbing the mountain have managed to cast a shadow over the
<br>
entire mountain-climbing field through repeated failures to reach the top
<br>
*after cheerily predicting* that the top was within reach, then not all
<br>
those who attempt to reach the top are performing a public service by doing
<br>
so.
<br>
<p>Finally, even without deconstructing the rest of the parable, you can flip
<br>
its moral lesson quite easily by assuming that the mountain *is* much larger
<br>
than Y thinks.  And historically this would appear to be the heuristic
<br>
lesson of AI.
