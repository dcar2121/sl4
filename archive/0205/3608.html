Hi folks,
<br>
<p>As many people here know, I've been working somewhat secretively on my own
<br>
AI framework which takes a fairly unique approach in a couple respects.  In
<br>
truth, it isn't so much that it is a secret so much as it is that I am too
<br>
lazy to write anything up. :-)  A number of people have been asking for more
<br>
meat, and so I am going to start posting stuff to the web.  I figure that
<br>
eventually I'll have enough stuff up that I won't have to answer questions,
<br>
just point to the web.
<br>
<p>Since the girlfriend is out of town and after 60 weeks of work at the office
<br>
I don't feel like writing code, I've started writing things up and cutting
<br>
and pasting from various sources.  Note that the location is temporary;
<br>
don't count on it being there in a year.
<br>
<p>So here is a somewhat meandering (and utterly improper) architecture
<br>
overview doc:
<br>
<p><a href="http://jamesr.best.vwh.net/ARCH.html">http://jamesr.best.vwh.net/ARCH.html</a>
<br>
<p>Hopefully the formatting is okay, as it is obnoxious MS output (though it
<br>
looks fine in both Nutscrape and IE). Someday I will re-hack it into a
<br>
proper web doc.  This will give people some additional stuff to chew on.  I
<br>
actually have several more pages of relevant stuff I wrote this weekend, but
<br>
none of it (including the one above) have been edited or organized, though
<br>
I'll probably redo it eventually.
<br>
<p>I'll also be putting up miscellaneous software libs and DSP plugs (for audio
<br>
processing) that I've written that the world could use, so there may be some
<br>
other neat (but unrelated stuff) up there soon.
<br>
<p><p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
