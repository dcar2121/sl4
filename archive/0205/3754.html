<em>&gt; I guess my basic thesis is:  &quot;If you don't know how to describe how it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emerges, what it does, why it's there, how it contributes to general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence - if you do not, in short, know fully what you are doing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why - you will not succeed.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Sure, there is some truth in this.  And I know how to describe a lot more
<br>
than I wrote in the manuscript I gave you, just as you know how to describe
<br>
a lot more than you have written down at all....
<br>
<p>But I think your statement is a big overstatement, which is a genuine
<br>
disagreement between us.  I do believe in emergence in a deeper sense than
<br>
you do.
<br>
<p>Time and experimentation will tell!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And, some of the others who read it -- who were more a priori
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sympathetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than you to my overall philosophy of mind -- seemed to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; themselves and have had a more positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assessment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; design than yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did fill in the gaps.
</em><br>
<p>yes, but you filled them in differently than others did ;)
<br>
<p>of course, that so many different ways of filling in the gaps are possible
<br>
is a weakness in the manuscript...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This makes me suspicious of a claim that a higher-level behavior emerges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically because over here it sure as heck looks like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small target in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design space.
</em><br>
<p>Well maybe your intuition just ain't good enough to design an AGI ;&gt;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  But I think it would take a concrete demonstration or at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least a fully visualized walkthrough to convince me that there is a free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lunch here.  Sure, there might be free lunches on some behaviors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but *all*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them?
</em><br>
<p>It is not the case that the Novamente design expects *all* higher-level
<br>
organizational structures &amp; dynamics to emerge for free, just some of them
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think this is enough to explain it.  Under DGI it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty clear why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have to go through chimpanzees in order to incrementally evolve human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence (and I spend time discussing it in the paper).
</em><br>
<p>Sure, and this is not a very original point, as you know...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente theory in which all higher levels of cognition emerge naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a small set of lower-level behaviors, there is no obvious (to me)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason why the Novamente behaviors would not be incrementally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolvable, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any obvious reason why spider brains would not incrementally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale to human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size and capabilities.  Is there a reason why the Novamente design - not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as it is now, but for all plausible variations thereoff - is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unevolvable?
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, there are some detailed parts of it that seem to me to probably be
<br>
unevolvable, for instance the combinatory-logic-based schema module.  Other
<br>
parts like attention allocation are probably easily evolvable...
