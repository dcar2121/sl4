</em><br>
<p>I'm certainly going to have to put in the work to explain the system I want
<br>
to build to the people who will be helping build it, and furthermore, to get
<br>
to that point, I need to show suggestive evidence that the theory of AI is
<br>
worth testing.  Of course, for me too, there comes a point where I feel that
<br>
a discussion has run out of steam and decide to let the disagreement stand -
<br>
usually at that point where the other person has stopped saying anything new
<br>
and is merely repeating arguments that I've already answered.  At other
<br>
times I just don't have the time to respond.  But I do think that, in
<br>
general, explaining AI theories, even very complex parts of AI theories, is
<br>
worthwhile.  Setting the goal of creating an academic consensus is an
<br>
impossible barrier, but that doesn't rule out all discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My terrifyingly advanced age was not the point of that statement.  My point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was entirely different: that I had been thinking a lot about *emergent mind*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before launching into detailed AI design, so that for me and my team, our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detailed work was implicitly understood in the context of all this prior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff on emergent mind.  A context that was not adequately drawn into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book, as I've said a lot of times already.
</em><br>
<p>And &quot;Levels of Organization&quot; is a small fraction of my thoughts about AI,
<br>
but having given someone &quot;Levels of Organization&quot;, if they ask a question
<br>
whose answer isn't in _Levels_, I would still try to answer it.  I think
<br>
that being able to precisely articulate your own intuitions is part of what
<br>
goes into building an AI; when my intuition says something, I usually know
<br>
why my intuition is saying it, and I answer with the reason behind the
<br>
intuition rather than asking people to take it on faith.  Of course, other
<br>
people may feel differently about how a discussion should be conducted, but
<br>
if I'm consciously choosing not to ask people to take my intuitions on
<br>
faith, then it needs to be recognized that we're arguing by different rules
<br>
- observers need to take into account that I have just as large a base of
<br>
hidden complexity as anyone, even if I don't point it out.  I guess I don't
<br>
really find &quot;I've thought about this for years&quot; to be an impressive argument
<br>
- I've thought about it for years too, and a lot of people have thought
<br>
about it for years and still failed, and I could conceivably be shown up by
<br>
someone who's only thought about it for a few months but is far smarter than
<br>
I am.  At most it's an enabling condition, but not really one that is
<br>
impressive in itself.  If you've spent years thinking about AI, then you
<br>
should have a strong theory and should be able to argue from the theory
<br>
itself rather than arguing from the extrinsic credibility of being an
<br>
expert.  This is especially important in AI, where the senior experts are,
<br>
when you think about it, people who've spent a lot of time *not* slaying the
<br>
AI dragon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In bio &amp; finance we got really awesome results in terms of being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognized fancier patterns than anyone else.
</em><br>
<p>What results?  Why are they awesome?  According to my already-given estimate
<br>
of the system, Novamente does have a genuine AI capability in the domain of
<br>
pattern recognition and may be able to achieve a genuine AI capability in
<br>
solving some goal-oriented problems in the patterns it can recognize, so
<br>
recognizing fancier patterns than anyone else is exactly what I *think*
<br>
Novamente ought to be able to do, but it would still help to have a specific
<br>
example of a novel pattern that Novamente recognized.  I could, after all,
<br>
be too optimistic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My estimate of the amount of manpower required to make an AI has gone DOWN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the last 3 years, not up.  It went up from 1997-2000, and has gone down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from late 2000 till now.  This is because of the design simplifications that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went into the move from Webmind to Novamente...
</em><br>
<p>My estimate of the manpower required for AI has also gone down as I learned
<br>
more powerful solutions, but my estimate *started out* in around 2025 as a
<br>
massive planetwide project.
