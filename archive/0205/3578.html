<em>&gt; &gt;What is it that differentiates &quot;justice&quot; from &quot;revenge&quot; if not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;justification of maintaining order in a community?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Justice may have a role in the proper functioning of a society, but that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not what I am referring to here.  I see justice as of value itself.  I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live in a universe that is not &quot;evil&quot;.  That leaves &quot;good&quot; or &quot;morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balanced&quot;.  I quote these terms because I realize they are going to require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some explanation to separate them from their religious historical context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not advocating any religious philosophy (I don't personally to any).  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think these terms are more basic than any religion.  I think they are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason many people seek out religion.  I person directly feels these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts (not in a metaphysical sense) and looks for an explanation or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; framework to understand them.  Consequently many people are vulnerable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deception by those who would use these concepts for their own purposes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you observe some action or activity that is good it makes you feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good, and vice versa.  When you observe someone doing irreversible serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm to another not deserving it, you feel bad and want to make it right and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will make you feel better.  But here is the important part:  The reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you feel bad is you observe that the universe is out of balance.  There is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stain of evil on it which must be removed for the universe to return to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balance.  Because you know that if it is not corrected and if more stains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulate that the universe will become an evil place.  And the more evil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it becomes the easier it is for evil actions to take place.  And of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more evil actions the worse you feel.  It sounds kind of circular but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not an explanation, it's reality, and reality is often circular.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have all felt this.  Case in point:  we hear that someone has tortured and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murdered a young child,  we feel that the universe is out of balance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs to be made right.  The word for this is justice.  It's not for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, not for the victims, not for us, it's for the universe.
</em><br>
<p>But the actions that you call &quot;justice&quot; and I call &quot;revenge&quot; are, under my
<br>
view, a further stain on the universe.  That justice in our contemporary
<br>
society - harming or killing people to halt them from committing a crime,
<br>
throwing others in jail and restricting their freedoms - does in fact
<br>
minimize the total amount of stain on the universe more than a complete lack
<br>
of justice is its sole philosophical justification.  That it is a necessary
<br>
evil does not make it any less evil.  The stain on the universe caused by
<br>
child abuse does not go away if you shoot the abuser.  The stain is a part
<br>
of the indelible past history of the universe; it is eternal.  Shooting the
<br>
child abuser adds another stain, albeit a lesser one.  The sole
<br>
justification for doing so is that you are supposedly, in this way, helping
<br>
to prevent further child abuse which would be an even greater stain on the
<br>
universe than the killing of a child abuser.
<br>
<p>And if the Singularity brings the adding of further stains to a shrieking
<br>
halt, then hurting a child abuser, if you could do it, would be a pure
<br>
negative-sum game.  Justice does not erase past stains on the universe; it
<br>
minimizes the number of new stains created.  Stripped of this justification,
<br>
justice is merely revenge.  Short of time travel nothing is ever going to
<br>
wipe out those past stains, and I really don't know the rules of morality
<br>
under time travel, so I don't know if even that would do it; but failing
<br>
time travel, the past history of the universe is an eternal crystal. 
<br>
Nothing can change it; nothing can balance it.  It may be hard to accept
<br>
that our actions are eternal and that nothing can ever give us a clean
<br>
slate; that we can outweigh our mistakes but not actually erase them; so
<br>
it's important to remember that good deeds, like evil deeds, also become
<br>
part of the indelible history of the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why do I care if you don't share my ideas about justice?  Because you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing the code of the friendliness system of the first AI.  You are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be training it in friendliness, and testing it against your moral system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your moral character is of prime importance to all of us.  It is an issue.
</em><br>
<p>I don't dispute that, as long as people realize that it's not the only
<br>
issue; to have an AI built by an earnest fool is an unnecessary risk but
<br>
there are still ways for an imperfect philosopher to build a better
<br>
philosopher.
