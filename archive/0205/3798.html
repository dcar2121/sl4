<br>
<p>If you stripped away all the English names from all AI content and replaced
<br>
them with randomly generated strings, so that the AI could no longer handle
<br>
human-supplied problems and human-supplied data which required
<br>
identification or invocation of concepts by English name, what capabilities
<br>
would the AI still possess?
<br>
<p>***
<br>
<p>Let me be sure I understand this one by exploring it in a Novamente context
<br>
<p>Your question is about what happens if, in Novamente, I do the following 
<br>
process:
<br>
<p>--&gt;  For all WordNodes and WordInstanceNodes in the system, replace the 
<br>
ListLink of CharacterNodes that is connected to the WordNode or 
<br>
WordInstanceNode by a ConcatContained Link, with a ListLink to a random 
<br>
sequence of CharacterNodes.  Do this in a way so that the WordInstanceNodes 
<br>
with MemberLinks to WordNode X all get the same random sequence of 
<br>
CharacterNodes
<br>
<p>The answer is:
<br>
<p>1) The links to the random sequences will be forgotten in time as they will 
<br>
prove useless, as will be the ListLInks of random char sequences and the 
<br>
bogus WN/WIN's
<br>
<p>2) In time, through exposure to human language again, new WordNodes will 
<br>
form representing actual linguistic groundings for the system's concepts
<br>
<p>However, process 2 may take a while.  This is less hard than first language 
<br>
learning because a linguistically-inspired concept structure has been left 
<br>
intact; it's basically like second-language learning of a language that has 
<br>
no phonological or typographical similarity to one's first language.
<br>
<p>So your question is designed to identify systems that are capable of 
<br>
language understanding based on programmed-in rules, but not of language 
<br>
learning, e.g. systems like the current version of Cyc, right?
<br>
<p>I clarify that my answer refers to the behavior we expects to see in a 
<br>
complete Novamente system, not the behavior one would see in the current 
<br>
Novamente system, which is far from having functional language learning 
<br>
capability yet.
