<p>
For me, one of the highlights of the Foresight Gathering was Christine
<br>
Peterson (President of Foresight) reminding everyone at the Foresight
<br>
Gathering of some important rules for how to avoid forming a clique.  And I
<br>
listened to her and thought to myself:  &quot;Chris Peterson had to put effort
<br>
into doing this.  It didn't just happen.&quot;  Any group of people who have
<br>
something in common, and who have their own mailing list, will naturally
<br>
tend to form a clique unless specific steps are taken to avoid it.  It's not
<br>
something that happens when we do something wrong; it's something that
<br>
happens by default.
<br>
<p>The only really long-term solution that I know of is studying up on
<br>
evolutionary psychology and learning to see yourself as a modified primate,
<br>
after which you start to recognize the emotions relating to tribalism and
<br>
group polarization dynamics.  Meanwhile, because the SL4 list isn't my own
<br>
private piece of territory, I expect there will always be people here who
<br>
disagree with me about evolutionary psychology, newcomers who haven't had
<br>
the chance or don't have the time to read up on ev-psych, and so on.  So
<br>
here's a list of some of the ways I recognize groupishness.
<br>
<p>1)  Individual actions are taken as being representative of the group.  This
<br>
hasn't happened on SL4 yet, but I've seen it happen on two occasions very
<br>
recently - once between the WTA and Extropy, and once between the Extropians
<br>
mailing list and the Church of Virus mailing list.  Or to be more precise,
<br>
once between James Hughes (WTA) and several Extropians, and once between
<br>
Eugene Leitl and Hermit (CoV).  Usually what happens is that someone from
<br>
Group A, speaking as an individual, says something bad about Group B, and
<br>
Group B takes this as an assault from Group A - or at least one individual
<br>
from Group B takes this as an assault from Group A.  The really nasty part
<br>
of this situation is that often Group A, instead of issuing a disclaimer and
<br>
trying to sort the issue out, reacts in kind to Group B - or rather, several
<br>
people from Group A react in kind to people from Group B.  This is how an
<br>
individual disagreement can escalate into a tribal war.  Very nasty.  In
<br>
both cases the issue was successfully sorted out, but only because several
<br>
people, including me, were there thinking:  &quot;Argh!  Group polarization
<br>
dynamics!&quot; and pounding the sand trying to get things sorted out, instead of
<br>
paying attention to the putative topic of dispute.
<br>
<p>2)  Writing for other group members is another symptom of cliqueishness -
<br>
this is another of the things Christine Peterson specifically highlighted. 
<br>
Writing for people who are already convinced accomplishes nothing - why
<br>
would anyone even try to do it?  Because it's easier and natural; it happens
<br>
by default unless someone tries to prevent it.  The only acceptable proposal
<br>
I've ever heard for &quot;writing for SL4 members&quot; was a putative project to
<br>
summarize some of the major threads in the archives.  Aside from that, there
<br>
are two kinds of writing; there's FAQs and other introductory literature
<br>
targeted at a mass audience, where assuming scientific literacy is the most
<br>
you can get away with; and there are very detailed explorations of a
<br>
specific topic where the intent is to say something new about the issue. 
<br>
What could possibly be the point of writing introductory material for an SL4
<br>
audience?
<br>
<p>3)  Every now someone on SL4 accuses us of groupthink or accuses me of being
<br>
the local guru.  Usually this person is also incapable of correct spelling
<br>
or structured thinking and gets kicked out for that reason; the ones who can
<br>
write a decent post stay and usually learn better after a while.  Of course
<br>
this doesn't just happen on SL4; I recently witnessed a very comical
<br>
incident wherein someone in a chat channel who was spamming the channel
<br>
insisted that he was being banned from chats because chat ops were all
<br>
power-mad dictators.  However, just because a lot of annoying people launch
<br>
throwaway accusations of this class doesn't mean that we can get careless to
<br>
the point of letting it become true.  If you find yourself looking at a bad
<br>
post and thinking &quot;Ew, how un-SL4,&quot; then that's probably groupthink. 
<br>
Remember that there are plenty of non-SL4s out there who are scientifically
<br>
literate, extremely versed in the SL3 or whatever futurism, who are
<br>
excellent writers who could dismember many SL4 posters in the blink of an
<br>
eye, and who will be completely welcome on this mailing list if they ever
<br>
choose to show up.  There are people who plain don't believe in the
<br>
Singularity who subscribe to SL4 and make perfectly good posts.  So if
<br>
you're looking at a bad post and thinking &quot;Ew, how un-SL4,&quot; then that's
<br>
groupthink.  The real problem probably isn't that the person's
<br>
technological-futurism assumptions are different than yours, but that they
<br>
made some other kind of mistake entirely.  Attributing a vague feeling of
<br>
&quot;That's wrong&quot; or &quot;That makes no sense&quot; to the poster being &quot;un-SL4&quot; is
<br>
groupishness.  Attacking the poster for being un-SL4 is definitely
<br>
groupishness.
<br>
<p>Will Pearson's problem is not that he is &quot;un-SL4&quot; or that he thinks
<br>
self-modifying goal systems inevitably drift - it's perfectly acceptable for
<br>
someone to show up and say, &quot;You know, I'm going to have to disagree with
<br>
the Friendliness advocates about this one; I think that self-modifying goal
<br>
systems are inevitably going to drift.&quot;  It's saying:  &quot;I have this
<br>
brilliant idea which you people have clearly never thought of: 
<br>
Self-modifying goal systems are going to drift,&quot; that marks the speaker as
<br>
someone who needs to read up a bit more in order to learn, not so much the
<br>
specific technical counter to this argument, but rather that the SL4 list is
<br>
of reasonable collective intelligence and may have thought of this objection
<br>
already.  &quot;People who've spent their lives as the smartest person in the
<br>
room&quot; syndrome.
<br>
<p>Mike-and-Donna (whichever of them they are) are perfectly welcome to
<br>
disagree about whether morality requires post-Singularity revenge on
<br>
pre-Singularity criminals.  You are welcome to be horrified by this (I am),
<br>
but in what specific way is it un-SL4?  Attributing this to un-SL4-ishness
<br>
seems to me like groupthink.
<br>
<p>Max Comess's previous crime was a series of one-line posts followed by the
<br>
spamming of people I'd like to talk to someday.  But since then he raised
<br>
the quality of his posts and I have no objection to the recent ones.  Why is
<br>
proposing a planetary soup of self-modifying heuristics stupid?  Back in
<br>
1999/2000 that was my actual proposed strategy for implementing the
<br>
Singularity!
<br>
<p>Well, that's pretty much what I wanted to say.  Hopefully anyone subscribed
<br>
to the mailing list or reading the archives will remember that being the
<br>
moderator is not the same as being the tribal chief, and that if other SL4
<br>
list members feel that groupishness is the best way to bond into a group
<br>
capable of achieving its goals, there isn't anything I can do about it
<br>
except try to persuade them otherwise.
