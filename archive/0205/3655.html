<em>&gt;Nice!
</em><br>
<p>Thanks!  To get any kind of positive feedback from a real writer is very
<br>
gratifying.

</em><br>
<p>I think calculating the exact moment of the Singularity should be fairly
<br>
straight forward.  Take a look at Kurzweil's charts for a general idea of
<br>
how to approach the problem.  But put all the charts on the same paper.  His
<br>
charts are not high enough resolution and he doesn't show the mathematical
<br>
extrapolations.  In order to improve the resolution you would need to
<br>
research the data for as many points as possible.  Get a very large piece of
<br>
paper and a very fine line set of colored pencils, so you could see the
<br>
individual lines.  Color code the different lines in order of importance.
<br>
Chart time across the bottom and whatever the appropriate scale for each
<br>
dataset up the side.  Use a computer to calculate the best fit curves and do
<br>
the extrapolations.  The Singularity is coming along with such precision and
<br>
regularity that it should be possible to pin point it down to a few days.
<br>
If I had the time I would do this myself I would, but I have a job to go to,
<br>
and a kid to raise.  If you read &quot;The Law of Accelerating Returns&quot;  by   Ray
<br>
Kurzweil.
<br>
Kurzweil's Singularity essay on his website with all his charts and
<br>
exponential growth formulas, the text explains that he has been purposely
<br>
conservative in all his estimates:
<br>
<p>Kurzweil writes:
<br>
<em>&gt;This is actually a conservative assumption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In general, innovations improve V (computer power) by a multiple,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not in an additive way.
</em><br>
<p>I think his charts and formulas overestimate the time to the Singularity
<br>
(2021).  My feeling is closer to 2005.
<br>
<p>Spudboy also writes:
<br>
<em>&gt;I wonder if intelligence, like the speed of light, has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;embedded limit?
</em><br>
<p>I think there has to be a limit.  Consider, 2 + 2 = 4, or the solar system
<br>
has nine planets, or the motor branch of the median nerve leaves the main
<br>
trunk at the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament to innervate the
<br>
thenar muscles.  If we both know these things can you know them better than
<br>
I do?  Assuming the universe is limited, once you know everything haven't
<br>
you hit the limit?

<em>&gt;Excellent new story!  I love your stories, hehe.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you!  I appreciate every comment.  I write these stories not so much
<br>
for people to throw flowers but rather to generate discussion of some of the
<br>
controversial points.  I was really disappointed on &quot;Four Years Later&quot; that
<br>
no one except Eliezer wrote &quot; hey dummy, that's not how it's going to
<br>
be...&quot;.  There was a lot to object to in that one.  I hope no one is worried
<br>
about hurting my feelings, they're titanium plated.

<br>
<em> &gt;You should write more,
</em><br>
<p>I wish I could.  I'm not a professional writer, but I love it.  I'm not a
<br>
very good writer, which isn't so much a matter of lack of knowledge or
<br>
skills but a lack of discipline.  I don't take the requisite time and effort
<br>
to add enough description and don't check everything before sending it out.
<br>
Every time I send one out, I wait for it to come back, then read it again
<br>
and find all kinds of mistakes and stuff I was thinking about putting in
<br>
that got forgotten.

<p>Michael Anissimov also wrote:
<br>
<em> &gt;May I throw up your latest one and publish it?
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  And you don't have to keep asking.  Anything I put on here is free to
<br>
do with whatever you want.  Although, it would be nice if you could send me
<br>
a link.  I recently tried to access your site and got a &quot;Forbidden&quot; message.

<p>Hmm... I have some stuff I wrote for &quot;Penthouse Letters&quot; which may not be
<br>
appropriate for this site.  The next story which is rolling around in my
<br>
head is about what can go wrong when uploading is implemented in a
<br>
McDonald's like retail format with an outlet in every town operated by
<br>
minimum wage teenagers with no special skills.
