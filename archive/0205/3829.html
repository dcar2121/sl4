<p>
One thing I should add.  His comments on AI and cognition, which are
<br>
speculative and not grounded at all directly in any of the numerous
<br>
computational experiments he reports in the book, lean much more in the A2I2
<br>
direction than the Novamente or DGI or Cyc directions.
<br>
<p>He forcibly states his intuition that
<br>
<p>a) cognition is a set of emergent behaviors that come out of very simple
<br>
rules
<br>
<p>b) CA-ish rules will be able to give rise to these emergent behaviors.
<br>
<p>(Note that NN models with local learning rules are easily castable in
<br>
&quot;CA-ish&quot; form ... especially NN's embedded in an ambient dimensional space,
<br>
e.g. a 3D space)
<br>
<p>I agree with his philosophical position but I think that, due to lack of
<br>
time spent pondering and analyzing the details of cognition and experiential
<br>
learning, he overestimates the simplicity of the rules underlying emergent
<br>
cognitive behavior (although I'm sure these rules can be made very very
<br>
simple compared to the emergent behaviors, I don't think they can be made as
<br>
simple as he does)

<em>&gt; Subject: A New Kind of Science
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I got the book yesterday.  I skimmed it and read a few chapters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully (Chapters 1 and 2, and the chapters on Physics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perception/Analysis).  Over the next few weeks I'll read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole thing carefully.  Now I just have a few preliminary observations:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) There seemed to be nothing in the book fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceptually new to me.  However, there is much in the book that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been conceptually treated only in various &quot;marginal&quot; places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than in the scientific mainstream.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) What he has done, from my point of view, is to go through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; LOT of ideas from the complex systems literature and place them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all within a common framework of cellular-automaton-ish systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Not all his dynamical systems are strictly CA's, but most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them are either CA's or very similar).  This allows a single book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discuss what otherwise would take 10 different books, each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involving a different notation and mathematical formalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) His physics approach is cool, but in my view no better (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse) than some other discrete physics approaches, such as Tony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smith's (even fringier) &quot;Vodou Physics&quot; model [There is a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cool stuff on Tony's website, see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/TShome.html">http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/TShome.html</a> ]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) His treatment of perception and analysis is conceptually fine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but very limited and does not even come close to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pragmatically useful for AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) His discussion of biological pattern-formation is a repeat, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat more elegant form, of a lot of old ideas from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems theory literature.  For instance, A. Lima de Faria's old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book &quot;Evolution without Selection&quot; makes the same conceptual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points (along with other more controversial ones) but without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numerous CA and quasi-CA examples.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it progress?  Yeah.  It's nice to have a common formalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (CA's and quasi-CA's) for dealing with all these diverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex-systems phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is it a new kind of science?  Maybe.  But it's not *that* new --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's &quot;complex systems science&quot; which has been gathering steam for a while.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MAYBE his CA-ish formalism will prove powerful enough to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex systems science into a &quot;real science&quot;, but this book does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not demonstrate that, because it doesn't really come to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dramatic and definitive scientific conclusions in any particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; branch of science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He admits that the truly revolutionary nature of his approach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will only be seen in 10-20 years.  Maybe so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that maybe the reason he doesn't agree that most of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *concepts* are old ones, is that he thinks he's gotten them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;right&quot;.  Whereas to me it just seems like he's said familiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things a little *differently*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The big problem is, given a complex system you want to build, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a complex phenomenon you want to analyze, how do you go about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructing a CA-ish model of it?  (By intuition based on other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples, is his method, it seems.)  And if the CA-ish model you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find just *qualitatively* but not exactly models the phenomenon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or realizes the behavior, how useful is it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finding a CA-ish model to *exactly* model a given collection of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data about a given system or set of systems, is a problem of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function learning approachable via GP-type methods, but he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't go there...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I certainly look forward to reading the book more fully, as there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is much to be learned from the details in the other chapters I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't yet read carefully I'm sure...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
