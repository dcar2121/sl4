<p>I have to disagree with this.  While it is true that 'idle' speculation has
<br>
little value, reasoned speculation such as that posted by Mike Deering and
<br>
Dani
<br>
Eder is often valuable in providing alternate perspectives to compare with
<br>
one's own.

Mike Deering: I agree with your enthusiastic assessment that &quot;Underground AI
is
BIG BIG BIG!&quot;, but I very much doubt that corporations like IBM$ and M$ are
developing anything other than GOFAI.  These are incredibly conservative
organizations, who would see zero benefit (more precisely, zero profit) in
creating a self-improving AI.  I strongly suspect that the groups making the
IBM$ and M$ R&amp;D decisions are sufficiently smart and well-informed enough to
realise that the very first real self-improving AI that has a hard (or even
a
soft) take off, will cause their corporate reason-for-existence to evaporate
like spilled ether.
As for Deep Blue being a parlour trick... not exactly... it was designed,
conceived and executed with one purpose in mind: to improve IBM's image in
order to create more profit.  (And, by the way, it worked!)
One last thing, Mike Deering: your short stories Kick Butt!  B^D
