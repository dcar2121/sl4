</em><br>
<p>Humanity has created many different systems of philosophy which are
<br>
incompatible with each other. It seems to me that the CFAI approach, if it
<br>
works at all, should work with any philosophy that is self consistent.
<br>
Therefore the question of which philosophy do you subscribe to seems a
<br>
relevent one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's an interesting question.  I would expect/hope resource conflicts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along these lines to be rare.  
</em><br>
<p>I disagree. There are 6 billion minds on Earth and presumably there will
<br>
be at least that many post-Singularity. All it would take for resource
<br>
conflicts to occur is for one mind to want use all matter in the solar
<br>
system to build a giant optical telescope, and another one to use all
<br>
matter to simulate an alternate universe. Why would you expect that 6
<br>
billion different sets of supergoals can all be achieved without
<br>
significant resource conflicts?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One take is that after the Singularity all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentient beings would get a quantity of &quot;mana&quot; and that mana could be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bid on whichever universal resources are conserved, after which all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conserved resources would be private property.  But that's just a guess.
</em><br>
<p>I guess that means you don't subscribe to communism, which says private
<br>
property is bad, or democracy, which says that as long as a majority
<br>
agrees, a tax can be imposed on everyone's property to serve some common
<br>
purpose.  So do you believe that private property is good in itself, or is
<br>
it good because it leads to good consequences?
<br>
<p>Don't you think it would be a good idea, before porting your philosophy 
<br>
into an AI, to examine your philosophy in detail and make sure that is 
<br>
really what you want to port?
