<p>
<em>&gt; It's very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traditional to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view category structure as a hierarchy with more abstract concepts at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;top&quot;, although whether this convention reflects real properties of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system is debatable.  However, goals tend to center around neither very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract categories nor very concrete categories, but rather an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intermediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level called basic-level categories.  Basic-level categories have a wide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range of interesting properties; they tend to be the most abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categories for which you can still call up a specific mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; image,
</em><br>
<p>Ah, we do disagree here.
<br>
<p>I think that some goals are definitely associated with more abstract
<br>
categories than the ones you call &quot;basic-level.&quot;
<br>
<p>*Compassion*, I feel, is an example.  I find it hard to get a concrete feel
<br>
or image for what compassion really means, in the deepest sense, yet it's
<br>
still a deep-seated goal of mind.
<br>
<p>Similar is the goal of *creativity*.  This is a very abstract goal, not
<br>
tangible or easily imaged.
<br>
<p>To me the most important and deepest goals are the ones that go *beyond* the
<br>
domain of the easily, tangible image-able.
<br>
<p>I guess I am revealing my quasi-mystical streak here... but of course
<br>
&quot;mysticism&quot; and the notion of &quot;higher goals&quot; is an important part of human
<br>
psychology and experience...
<br>
<p>And I think that much of what is screwed up about the HUMAN goal system is
<br>
that our high-level abstract goals are on an equal (or often lower) level to
<br>
very concrete goals like &quot;Get me sex!&quot; ,  &quot;Get me food!&quot;,  &quot;Keep me alive!&quot;
<br>
<p>One thing I didn't say in that article, but I now think I should have, is
<br>
that the human goal structure DOES violate the dual network structure in
<br>
many ways, AND that this is, in my view, a large part of the reason why
<br>
we're so bloody fucked up...
<br>
<p>However, we do NOT have very powerful self-modifying capabilities, which is
<br>
why we have persisted with a somewhat fucked-up goal structure for so
<br>
long...
<br>
<p>The thing is, our goal structure is largely atavistic.  When our goals of
<br>
sex, food and continued life emerged in our animal ancestors they were close
<br>
to the top of our internal dual networks.
<br>
<p>But, then we developed much more abstract upper levels in our internal dual
<br>
networks, yet our goal systems have only very partially and slowly adapted.
<br>
<p>A strongly self-modifying superhumanly intelligent AI is going to be able to
<br>
adapt itself a lot faster... so it will not last as long with a
<br>
non-dual-network-harmonious goal structure...
<br>
<p>Thanks for leading me down this direction of thought; this will go in the
<br>
next revision of that essay ;&gt;
