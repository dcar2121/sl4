<em>&gt; Why do I care if you don't share my ideas about justice?  Because you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing the code of the friendliness system of the first AI.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be training it in friendliness, and testing it against your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral system.
</em><br>
<p>I'd like there to be a little more clarity on this point.
<br>
<p>So far as I know, Eliezer is not, right now, &quot;writing the code of the
<br>
friendliness system of the first AI.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rather, he is thinking hard about how to create a seed AI, and perhaps doing
<br>
some high-level design and some very partial prototyping.
<br>
<p>There are others besides Eliezer who are actually much further along than
<br>
Eliezer in the attempted-AI-creation process, and are actually coding
<br>
would-be seed-AI's according to their own designs and ideas.  Peter Voss and
<br>
I (both members of this list, with separate projects) are examples.
<br>
<p>And there are others who don't share the seed-AI/hard-takeoff philosophy
<br>
(which Eliezer, peter and I do share, in spite of relatively minor
<br>
conceptual differences of viewpoint) but are working hard at coding
<br>
artificial general intelliences (AGI's).  Pei Wang, a former collaborator of
<br>
mine, is another example; he's been coding part-time on his would-be
<br>
artificial general intelligence (AGI) for quite some years.  Jason Hutchens,
<br>
when a-i.com existed, was making some decent progress on his own would-be
<br>
AGI as well; I'm not sure what he's up to now.  It's important to recognize
<br>
that someone doesn't necessarily have to &quot;believe&quot; in the hard takeoff to
<br>
create an AGI system capable of experiencing/initiating such a thing.
<br>
<p>Now, Eliezer believes that all others who are working on seed AI and AGI are
<br>
off on the wrong track, in one way or another.  He apparently believes that
<br>
he has a better chance than anyone else of achieving the grand goal.  If you
<br>
choose to share his belief, that's fine.  I happen not to share Eliezer's
<br>
belief in this regard, though I agree with him on a large number of other
<br>
things.  More so than Eliezer, I tend to think there are many possible
<br>
&quot;right tracks&quot; to AGI and seed AI, just as there are many ways to achieve
<br>
human flight (think dirigibles, airplanes and helicopters...).
<br>
<p>I think that Eliezer, along with many others, has contributed and is
<br>
contributing very valuably to the quest for seed AI and to the general quest
<br>
for Singularity acceleration.  I don't intend any disrespect for his work or
<br>
his intellect.  And I'd be pretty damn thrilled if he were to unveil his
<br>
top-secret &quot;baby Friendly AI mind&quot; tomorrow.  However, so far as I know, it
<br>
is just not true that he is &quot;writing the code of the friendliness system of
<br>
the first AI.&quot;
