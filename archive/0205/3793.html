I can't really contribute as many questions as I'd like, but here are a few
<br>
candidates:
<br>
<p>What kind of things does your AI learn?
<br>
What kind of things are preprogrammed?
<br>
What kind of things are invented on the spur of the moment?
<br>
Do the answers to these questions reflect structural distinctions - i.e.
<br>
different kinds of cognitive content within the AI?
<br>
<p>Is there a systemic distinction between feature structure, category
<br>
structure, and event structure?  (Of course this question requires some
<br>
theoretical background.)
<br>
Is there a representational distinction?
<br>
<p>What kind of combinatorial patterns does your system contain?
<br>
Do they combine through blending or structures or both?
<br>
How large are the individual patterns?
<br>
How large are the combinations?
<br>
When the patterns combine, do they yield a new, larger representation of the
<br>
same type, or do they yield a different kind of representation?  In the
<br>
latter case, can the combined representation be transformed back into a
<br>
bigger building block?
<br>
<p>What needs to happen in order for your system to notice an implication
<br>
between two events?
<br>
What needs to happen in order for your system to notice an implication
<br>
between two perceptual features of an object?
<br>
<p>How does your system track object-part hierarchies in perceptual data?
<br>
<p>Can your system imagine perceptual data of the same kind as is produced by
<br>
its sensory capacities?
<br>
<p>Does your system originate actions in virtual or real environments?
<br>
<p>Does your system originate internal actions?
<br>
Does your system have a reflective &quot;sensorimotor&quot; environment in which it
<br>
can learn skills and perceptual categories?
<br>
<p>How does your system choose between actions?
<br>
<p>How does your system learn realtime skills?
<br>
How does your system learn realtime reflective skills?
<br>
<p>When your system learns something, what are the specific ways in which the
<br>
learned content and the experience of learning contribute to solving similar
<br>
future problems?
<br>
<p>...actually, I think I'd better stop now.
<br>
