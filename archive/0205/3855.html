<em>&gt; The first step is to develop a reading list of books that have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influential in developing rational thought.  In order to expand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, I'm asking you to reply with any additions that you might have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's what we have so far (putting my initial list and Eliezer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additions together):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beyond anthropomorphism by Eliezer Yudkowsky (section 2 of CFAI)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Man:  The Moral Animal by Robert Wright
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Mind's Past by Michael S. Gazzaniga
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig
</em><br>
<p>If you're going to recommend Pirsig, I think his second book (what was the
<br>
title?  &quot;Lila&quot; ?) actually went into a lot more depth about the working of
<br>
the mind, the patterns of culture and their influence on the mind, etc.
<br>
Check it out.
<br>
<p>A really really deep book on the freeing of the mind from irrationality of
<br>
all sorts is &quot;Thought as a System&quot; by David Bohm, which goes on and on about
<br>
liberating ourselves from cultural and biological thought systems.  It was
<br>
deeply influenced by Bohm's (he's a quantum physicist) long relationship
<br>
with Krishnamurti
<br>
<p>Krishnamurti, &quot;The Nature of the Mind&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://208.234.18.51/mcart/index.cgi?ID=QZYELO&amp;task=show&amp;cat=Nature+of+the+M">http://208.234.18.51/mcart/index.cgi?ID=QZYELO&amp;task=show&amp;cat=Nature+of+the+M</a><br>
ind
<br>
It's true that Krishnamurti was religious in a sense, but not in a mystical
<br>
or mythical sense at all.  I know of no better writing on the experience of
<br>
having a mind that irrationally pushes one in all sorts of crazy directions.
<br>
Very different from more &quot;scientific&quot; books on the mind in that, following
<br>
the Eastern tradition, the focus is on *conscious experience* .
<br>
<p><p>Also, to anyone who enjoys sci-fi at all, I'd recommend
<br>
**Riverworld**, by Philip Jose' Farmer [a series of 5 novels.  A couple
<br>
characters, Piscator and Nur, are held out as paragons of enlightened
<br>
rational thought, and there is a heck of a lot of discourse on the topic of
<br>
rationality and the flaws of ordinary human thought.  Also, thought it could
<br>
use some serious red-penciling, it remains a really great work of fiction
<br>
;&gt; ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If anyone is wondering how the heck this relates to SL4, I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encouraging rational thought as a way to reduce public resistance to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity since, as we have seen many times on this list and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places, most people reject the Singularity because they think too much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like an ape and not enough like a rational mind.  And, even if something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this doesn't work out to help the Singularity, it's still neat to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compile something that we can print out and hand to people when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't understand why they have some thought or feeling.
</em><br>
<p>I think that to get many humans to think significantly more rationally is
<br>
either
<br>
<p>a) impossible, or
<br>
<p>b) such a long-term project that it would take vastly longer than the 10-100
<br>
years we have till the Singularity
<br>
<p>I will admit that people think a little more rationally now than 1000 years
<br>
ago... at least in some parts of the world....  But this was a long time
<br>
coming.  I can't see change in human culture equally technological change in
<br>
its pace.
<br>
<p>So, while I think that advocating rational thought is a good thing, I doubt
<br>
efforts in this regard are going to help much with Singularity acceptance.
<br>
No reason not to try though ;)
<br>
<p>One more thing; I think the term &quot;rational thought&quot; can rub some people the
<br>
wrong way.  It rubs *me* the wrong way a little, and would certainly have
<br>
the same impact (but more strongly) on many artists &amp; musicians &amp; writers
<br>
whom I know.  Artistic sorts value their &quot;irrational&quot; intuitions and tastes
<br>
very much.  Now, your citation of Pirsig indicates to me that you don't mean
<br>
&quot;rationality&quot; in a very narrow sense -- i.e. you don't mean it to rule out
<br>
following wild intuitions, you just mean it to rule out following wild
<br>
intuitions *without rationally understanding that they're wild intuitions
<br>
and that sometimes the best thing to do is to follow them.&quot;
<br>
<p>But anyway, I think you should be extra clear about this when writing up
<br>
your manifestoes of rationality, to avoid alienating large sectors of the
<br>
intellectual population (I say the &quot;intellectual population&quot; because only a
<br>
teeeeny fraction of the population gives a crap about rationality or
<br>
intuition or artistic creativity or anything vaguely related to any of these
<br>
things!)
<br>
