<p>I didn't say that any of them are. I'm trying to figure out if yours is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But of course this is a highly optimistic view; on the other hand, mana plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Minimum Living Space seems like a straightforward way of settling any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict, not just insignificant ones.
</em><br>
<p>What about new minds born post-Singularity? Do they get an equal share of
<br>
mana? What if ten new minds are created and then get merged into one.  Do
<br>
they get ten shares or one? What about copies of minds? Also, how does it
<br>
deal with non-renewable resources, e.g., negentropy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From your previous answer it seems as if only minds present *at*
</em><br>
Singularity will get a share of mana, and minds born later will have to
<br>
fend for themselves. But that policy isn't symmetrical with respect to
<br>
time (what's so special about that moment in time?), or with respect to
<br>
the space of all possible minds.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe that private property is a correct answer in this case because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be the bedrock for determining whether a solution like communism or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy is fair.  Suppose that I believe in private property, you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in democracy, and Damien Broderick believes in communism.  Assuming we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all still that human at this point, there's no reason why you and 2 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people can't choose to live in a democracy, while Broderick and 2 billion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others choose to live in a communism, and I and 2 billion others choose to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; live in a private-property system.  
</em><br>
<p>Suppose there's a project that will use 20% of all resources in the solar 
<br>
system, but will greatly benefit almost everyone. Would it be fair for the 
<br>
democracy to tax itself and build the project while everyone enjoys the 
<br>
benefits? What if only 1 billion join the democracy? Does the project 
<br>
not get built then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems simpler for conserved resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go 1/3 to each of the three systems than that nobody gets any conserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources (the communist solution; incidentally, how the heck does anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever make use of anything under post-Singularity communism?) 
</em><br>
<p>I guess they'll modify themselves to be totally and provably altruistic 
<br>
and then share their resources with each other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disposition of the conserved resources would be decided by majority vote. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, this just drops the question back a level and asks what criteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine &quot;simpler&quot;.  I would say that private property is the solution that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resonates most strongly with the Friendliness principles of &quot;If a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is arbitrary, let people pick their own answers&quot; and &quot;A symmetrical solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is better than an asymmetrical one; at the acausal level, symmetry is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mandatory&quot;.  It's possible to view communism and democracy as voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special cases of this rule.  If you can figure out a good way to ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communism and democracy symmetrically on the acausal level, you might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to make a case that they are more basic, or more consistent with other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral principles, than the private-property/volition model.
</em><br>
<p>Why doesn't the FAI make everyone altruistic and implement communism? 
<br>
Isn't that just as symmetrical as private-property/volition? BTW, where 
<br>
does &quot;If a question is arbitrary, let people pick their own answers&quot; 
<br>
appear in CFAI? There's a lot of discussion about symmetry but I didn't 
<br>
see much about freedom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why, yes, what a good idea.  No offense, Wei Dai, and I'm speaking strictly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my personal capacity as just one more poster on SL4, but gimme a break! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it took until now for that thought to filter into my head, I should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been locked up as a menace to the human species in 1998.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I didn't express myself very well there. What I meant is, please
<br>
write down your personal philosophy in more detail so you can get more
<br>
reviews and feedback.
