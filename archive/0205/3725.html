RE: singularity arrival estimate... idiocy... and human planktonben goertzel wrote

<p>For a while there are going to be minds that want to remain human instead
<br>
of transcending (Val Turchin called these &quot;human plankton&quot;, back in the late
<br>
&nbsp;60's when he started writing about this stuff... a comment on the relative 
<br>
advancement of humans and future uploaded intelligences). But will there
<br>
&nbsp;still be human plankton a few thousand years down the line? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not so certain .
<br>
<p>Rafal responded
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Interesting you should use this metaphor. If you look around, the combined mass of plankton, and lower beings like bacteria, and other microorganisms, is many orders of magnitude larger than the mass of all humans. Should the analogy be valid, the superintelligences might be just as massively outmassed and outnumbered by the human-level plankton, as we are outnumbered by the E.coli in your or my gut. Indeed, maybe they already are 
<br>
<p>My two cents...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the archae are still around. Granted they are restricted
<br>
&nbsp;to environments not easily exploitable by the eubacteria.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ancient&quot; environments inhabited by &quot;relic species&quot; may one
<br>
day include coastal real estate deep in a gravity well, similar to
<br>
archae and sulphur based  organisms around a deep sea vent.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I see no reason to suspect that baseline humans will not persist for
<br>
indefinite periods of time, if only because a Singleton Perfect Altruist
<br>
Power is a highly improbable event.  In most other scenarios humans
<br>
would be kept around as toys,pets, mementos/furniture, that sort of 
<br>
thing. It might even be analogous to the biological present of the canids,
<br>
far more numerous these days, kilo for kilo than pre-domestication,
<br>
with their least domesticated members going nearly extinct.  The 
<br>
ancestral canids nearly extinct, but select members of their
<br>
heredity are involved in incrutable ventures involving experiences
<br>
far far beyond anything they could begin to understand,
<br>
simply because it's helpful to their masters (the orbital
<br>
spacecraft with dog test passengers come to mind...).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This begs the question, which part of the species will Transcend,
<br>
and which won't.  Again, without a SIPAP, the post Singularity
<br>
solar system should look structurally similar to the difference
<br>
between a marine-only biota and a biosphere composed of
<br>
primitive land-colonizers and the marine life they sprang from.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I would prefer the analogy of what happened when archae 
<br>
absorbed prokaryotes  to form the first eukaryotes. That was
<br>
&nbsp;a real Singularity!  Evolution still finds it convenient to
<br>
use prokaryotes (and to a lesser extant archae) to *support* the
<br>
eukaryotes.  (from our perspective anyway)
<br>
<p>Moore's Law is &quot;merely&quot; the product of natural selection after all.
<br>
<p><p>Brian
<br>
<p>BTW Ben, 20 I.Q. points (on average), Industrial Age technology
<br>
vs. Iron Age tech, major phenotypic cosmetic differences AND
<br>
an imperfect understanding of modern species concept could
<br>
certainly lead one to suspect a &quot;tremendous difference&quot; between
<br>
two variants of a species...  I can and will argue that this is FAR
<br>
more defensible and understandable mistake to make  than theism, 
<br>
prohibitionism, or failure to take out a death insurance policy are.
