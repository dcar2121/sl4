<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tee hee.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer, maybe there should be a simple disclaimer on your page: &quot;Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subscribing to SL4, make damn sure that you ARE shock level 4, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the advanced memes that that entails, and can discuss them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without reflexive negative reactions&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gabe
</em><br>
<p>all,
<br>
Actually there ARE (at least a few) SL3 types on the list who are polite
<br>
and understand the concept of not spitting in the sandbox everyone
<br>
else is playing in.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I happen to be one of them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't claim to be at Shock Level Four, since I think a near-term
<br>
hard-take off nanosingularity is about as likely as my cat shitting a
<br>
9 millimeter beretta.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter Brains and the like are not problems, I just don't see them
<br>
as near term. I'd like to be a Jupiter brain someday, and keep my
<br>
meat body up in the attic for parties. BUT.....
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to note that just because someone doesn't jump on
<br>
a Singularity bandwagon doesn't mean they are somehow
<br>
&quot;below an appropriate Shock Level&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, how many people on this list can seriously claim to understand
<br>
the programming and cognitive science Eli and Ben throw around, at least
<br>
well enough to know if they have even a remote chance of success?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many I would say. I suspect even Eli and Ben can't really say they
<br>
truly know what they are talking about. That's the nature of doing something
<br>
that hasn't been done before.. it's all hazy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as far as dragging oneself up to that speed in the cogsci and the
<br>
compsci,
<br>
that's time intensive. VERY time intensive. Which is more important,
<br>
finishing
<br>
my education and entering a lucrative profession (a fairly &quot;sure thing&quot; so
<br>
to speak)
<br>
or entering a Ph.D. program in cogsci so I can really figure out whether
<br>
Friendliness is a pile of semantic horseshit or a Truly Brilliant Idea?
<br>
Guess it depends on what your goals are.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Point being I don't claim to be a Singularitarian (not in the singint
<br>
sense).
<br>
&nbsp;But many here do. If you claim to be at SL4 and you're a Singularity
<br>
fanatic why aren't you acting on it? Not to be a prick but &quot;memetic
<br>
engineering&quot;
<br>
and &quot;PR&quot; is a fine excuse not to work your ass off, at least for most folks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I claim to be a solid SL3 kindof guy, I should be putting in an
<br>
optimum
<br>
number of miles running each week, working on complete habitual CR by
<br>
the age of 30, making a pile of money for my brain-computer-interface,
<br>
watching
<br>
my tech stocks etc.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you claim to be a solid SL4 kind of guy/gal perhaps you should be in
<br>
grad
<br>
school, working on a doctorate so you can run interference for the AI guy
<br>
among the academic types who won't even bother to read something from
<br>
someone who doesn't have a &quot;union card&quot;.  :)  Maybe you will be
<br>
quietly working to develop skill in personal protection services or some
<br>
other highly useful skill for a Singularitarian.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you will be doing something entirely different. I would expect you
<br>
to be trying to understand CATAI at least well enough to try to catch Eli's
<br>
mistakes.  But that isn't the sort of traffice that permeates this &quot;SL 4&quot;
<br>
List
<br>
is it?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what MY excuse is..
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What's YOURS?
<br>
<p><p>arrogance, however satisfying, is usually a liability,
<br>
