<em>&gt; I understand that you don't share this belief.  But you should understand

</em><br>
<p>Of course.  Heck, my own belief is that an AI is built out of components
<br>
which are not only &quot;not scalable&quot; but are in fact &quot;not problem-solving&quot; if
<br>
you isolate them independently.  I agree that if you take several multistep
<br>
generic problem-solving algorithms and give them a common representation,
<br>
then the resulting tractable problem space will be the multiplicative rather
<br>
than the additive sum of the individually tractable problem spaces.  The
<br>
problem is that this *still* carves out only a tiny corner of the overall
<br>
problem space.  Giving several generic stepwise problem-solving algorithms a
<br>
common representation is certainly not a trivial design problem, but it is
<br>
still a design problem which is much easier than the functional
<br>
decomposition of general intelligence into interdependent, internally
<br>
specialized subsystems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What baffles me is not the fact that you hold this opinion, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredible air of certainty with which you make such a statement.  You *may*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly be right, but there's just no way you can *know* this!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goodness....
</em><br>
<p>Optimists are so strange... isn't it obvious that &quot;Idea X is right&quot; should
<br>
be used sparingly and tentatively and &quot;Idea X is wrong&quot; should be used often
<br>
and firmly, whether the ideas are your own or someone else's?  I can always
<br>
be wrong; that doesn't mean the other guy's notions have a better chance of
<br>
being right. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We ran some simple &quot;experiential interactive learning&quot; experiments, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were more at the level of a &quot;digital roach&quot; than a &quot;digital doggie&quot;... and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then we ran into nasty performance problems with the Webmind software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture (remedied with the Novamente architecture, and not connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with scalability problems in the underlying AI algorithms).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether the various experiences we've had experimenting with our AI systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been of any value for AGI or not, I suppose time will tell.  So far our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling is that they HAVE been valuable.
</em><br>
<p>And my continuing project is to get you to disgorge these experiences, or
<br>
just some of the highlights, in a sufficiently concrete form that they are
<br>
useful to a next generation of cognitive scientists who are looking at them
<br>
through the lens of other theories.  Or if the experiences are strong enough
<br>
evidence to force the viewer to adopt your perspective and beliefs about
<br>
them, that's fine too.  But in the meanwhile, knowing that you've had
<br>
experiences that you think are valuable, or that your &quot;experiential
<br>
interactive learning&quot; experiments seemed to you like a &quot;digital roach&quot;
<br>
rather than a &quot;digital doggie&quot;, or that you ran into &quot;nasty performance
<br>
problems&quot; which were &quot;remedied with the Novamente architecture&quot;, is not
<br>
sufficiently concrete; it provides information about your beliefs about your
<br>
experiences but does not provide the experiences themselves in enough detail
<br>
for others to form beliefs about them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to me like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another AI-go-splat debacle in the making.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, I think you've probably repeated that often enough, Eliezer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that is your opinion, and everyone else on this list (if they have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bothered to read all these messages) does as well.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps my memory is tricking me, but I think that if you look through the
<br>
list archives of SL4, you will find that I have never once said, on SL4 or
<br>
in any other public forum, that Novamente was an AI-go-splat debacle in the
<br>
making, until after I'd read the Novamente manuscript.  Because my memory
<br>
says that I was very careful not to say this until I'd posted a review of
<br>
your system and given you a chance to defend it.  Just FYI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll tell you one thing though.  It's sure pretty easy to talk to people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to do ambitious things and tell them &quot;That won't work!  You've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underestimated the difficulty of the problem!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you say that to 10 people trying to actually build AGI right now, you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bound to be right in at least, say, 8 or 9 of the cases.  In which case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll come out looking like you're pretty clever -- 80% or 90% prediction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accuracy!!
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know, this is what makes it an admitted cheap shot for me to, i.e.,
<br>
ask you what your system does to make you think it can exhibit general
<br>
intelligence.  And naturally, predicting that a design will not turn into a
<br>
successful seed AI is an ABSOLUTELY safe bet at any odds - the classic
<br>
&quot;Singularity Sucker Bet&quot;.
<br>
<p>However, do bear in mind that I have not just predicted a generic splat of
<br>
some undefined type, but also said something about the nature of the splat,
<br>
its origins, and what its consequences will look like.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One more thing.  I have spent waaaaaay too much time e-mailing to this list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the last few days.
</em><br>
<p>I noticed.  &lt;smile&gt;.
