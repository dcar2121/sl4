</em><br>
<p>This makes for a good segue into something I wanted to discuss with the 
<br>
list.
<br>
<p>As some of you are aware, for a few months we've had a Rational Thinkers 
<br>
list (for a while it was called Singularity Ethics, but that went 
<br>
nowhere).  Not a whole lot has happened there, but something I'm working 
<br>
on starting is an owner's manual to the human mind which will include in 
<br>
some fashion, after explaining how human's think (to the best of our 
<br>
knowledge, anyway), information and instructions on how to become a 
<br>
rational thinker (if `rational' is a blurry term for you, I roughly mean 
<br>
eliminating anthropomorphic biases/thinking and learning to think 
<br>
logically).
<br>
<p>The first step is to develop a reading list of books that have been 
<br>
influential in developing rational thought.  In order to expand the 
<br>
list, I'm asking you to reply with any additions that you might have.  
<br>
Here's what we have so far (putting my initial list and Eliezer's 
<br>
additions together):
<br>
<p>Beyond anthropomorphism by Eliezer Yudkowsky (section 2 of CFAI)
<br>
The Origins of Virtue by Matt Ridley
<br>
Man:  The Moral Animal by Robert Wright
<br>
The Mind's Past by Michael S. Gazzaniga
<br>
Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman
<br>
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig
<br>
<p>The next step will be to set up a collaborative Website(?) where people 
<br>
can work together on this book (the project is not only more than I 
<br>
could personally take on right now, but being an amateur cognitive 
<br>
scientist I don't really have the credentials to write such a book on my 
<br>
own).  With this in mind, does anyone know of any good Web applications 
<br>
that make this possible.  Gratis tools are preferred, since the current 
<br>
budget amounts to nothing more than some of my time.  I'm sure this kind 
<br>
of thing is out there, but I haven't used any of it before.  In 
<br>
particular, I want features like version control, user logins, and the 
<br>
ability to have a variety of levels in the book (e.g. subsubsubsections).
<br>
<p>If anyone is wondering how the heck this relates to SL4, I see 
<br>
encouraging rational thought as a way to reduce public resistance to the 
<br>
Singularity since, as we have seen many times on this list and other 
<br>
places, most people reject the Singularity because they think too much 
<br>
like an ape and not enough like a rational mind.  And, even if something 
<br>
like this doesn't work out to help the Singularity, it's still neat to 
<br>
compile something that we can print out and hand to people when they 
<br>
don't understand why they have some thought or feeling.
