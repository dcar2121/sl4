</em><br>
<p><p>There is another way to look at this that is correct, though I

personally don't really think about it in these terms. Every &quot;model&quot; is
<br>
essentially a universal Turing machine (with everything that implies,
<br>
except infinite memory) with a very unusual computing architecture
<br>
revolving around a structure that is an algorithmic superset (as it
<br>
were) of Solomonoff induction. 
<br>
<p>One of the generally interesting and useful things I've noticed
<br>
relatively recently is that it appears that the Halting Problem can
<br>
essentially be ignored. Any problem that exceeds a certain complexity
<br>
will stop at a best approximation when it hits the complexity limit of
<br>
the model, and infinite loop type situations that fit within the
<br>
complexity limit of the model are immediately detected simply as a
<br>
consequence of the organization. Everything appears to halt eventually,
<br>
though it may be an exception that causes it. I only mention this
<br>
because I've had to write code for regular software systems in the past
<br>
that could resolve these kinds of things, which was an awkward and ugly
<br>
thing at best and not totally reliable either. In this case, I seem to
<br>
have gotten those features for free, though it took me a long time to
<br>
even notice. Note that I haven't rigorously evaluated this, so I am not
<br>
100% certain, but what I described above appears to be the case; it
<br>
would certainly be pretty cool if this turned out to be correct in the
<br>
general case.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; However, I also suspect there may be a long path from getting the individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;model&quot; (in your language) to work well, and figuring out how to piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together a bunch of models into an overall functional mind....
</em><br>
<p><p>Actually, this is one of the easier parts.  I'm still fiddling with
<br>
this, but it is really at the point of just picking something I like and
<br>
going with it as there are a couple clean and reasonably simple
<br>
approaches that are working. As I stated, I can hard merge and turn two
<br>
models into one larger model that still has the general capabilities of
<br>
the individual models, but there is a loss of efficiency when you do
<br>
this with two models that have been built with two very different types
<br>
of data input. Clustering unrelated models rather than merging them
<br>
really does seem like the optimum pathway. Having short-term/working
<br>
memory model goes a long way toward making this work pretty seamlessly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Pei and I long ago made the observation that most of the algorithms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important for mind have exponential time and space complexity, but with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manageably small exponent for realistic problem sizes.  It's interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you've come up with the same conclusion in your work.
</em><br>
<p><p>This became apparent to me quite a while back.  The reason that one of
<br>
my long-time favorite rants is about the hardware limitation being
<br>
memory rather than CPU is that inadequate CPU will just make things run
<br>
slower, but inadequate memory pretty much leaves you hosed.  Inadequate
<br>
CPU may make things slow but at least it will get the right answer
<br>
eventually; inadequate memory is a &quot;brick wall&quot; limiter on effective
<br>
intelligence at any speed, IMO.
<br>
<p>I'm really short on time these days, so I apologize if my responses are
<br>
a bit belated.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
