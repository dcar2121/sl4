<p>
Hi, I'm Steve Reed and I've been working at Cycorp in Austin for the past
<br>
three years.  My most recent accomplishment to advance AI was the release
<br>
of the OpenCyc 0.6 beta this April at SourceForge.
<br>
<p>At Cycorp I was the first manager of the programming department, the first
<br>
project manager of the Darpa Rapid Knowledge Formation project, and the
<br>
instigator of OpenCyc.  My current job is manager for Cycorp's
<br>
participation in the Darpa DAML project.  I am fifty years old, having
<br>
received my first AI training back in 1972 with Herbert Gelertner.  I kept
<br>
up with the field by reading and hobby programming, as my career developed
<br>
in commercial (COBOL) data processing.  In the late 80's I started
<br>
smalltalk and OO programming, and my java programming (a cyc KB-store
<br>
clone) in 1998 brought me to the attention of Doug Lenat, who
<br>
offered me the dream job of a lifetime at Cycorp.
<br>
<p>Cycorp is fairly well known but as an employee I can tell our story from
<br>
the perspective of the members of this mail list.  We are working hard to
<br>
create a real AI.  Along the way we have created a solid deductive
<br>
inference engine, the world's largest commonsense knowledge base,
<br>
incorporated a planner, and with a staff of computational linguists, made
<br>
a good start towards a hookup of Natural Language processing and the Cyc
<br>
KB.  
<br>
<p>As it turns out, the KB and the Cyc ontology are useful components
<br>
for the kinds of software that Darpa wants to create in the wake of
<br>
9-11.  Our funding consequently is mainly governmental and our customers
<br>
are primarily military and intelligence community researchers -- but we
<br>
are not a classified facility and much of what we create for Darpa ends up
<br>
in OpenCyc.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, Darpa is not yet ready to fund the Singularity mission,
<br>
although as it gets closer, the US military will catch on first and
<br>
provide funding before the commercial sector.  The safety of the nation is
<br>
almost priceless.
<br>
<p>Cycorp is spending substantial effort on our mission.  We have a
<br>
staff of over 60 people in Austin, including a large number of PhD
<br>
philosophers, computational linguists and programmers.  Doug Lenat is our
<br>
president and is in this for the long haul.
<br>
<p>Cyc is programmed in SubL, using a commercial Lisp and a dialect named
<br>
SubL, whose purpose is the easy translation into C for deployed platforms,
<br>
such as OpenCyc.  We have not released the source code for the runtime
<br>
library, the object store, inference engine and all the html gui
<br>
tools. But OpenCyc is mostly the same binary executable as Darpa gets and
<br>
it is freely distributable.  The &quot;open&quot; part of OpenCyc is the KB content,
<br>
and I expect that you all see the value in that.  The logical scripting
<br>
language, CycL is what you use to assert new knowledge and to make
<br>
queries. 
<br>
<p>Regarding progress towards the Singularity, my intention is make OpenCyc
<br>
available to those who can add knowledge, especially
<br>
how-to/problem-solving knowledge when the point comes that Cyc can &quot;do
<br>
things&quot;.  I would like to add to Cyc those features that enable/begin what
<br>
is called here Seed AI and Friendly AI.  The DAML project seeks to
<br>
create/promote the Semantic Web, and I will position OpenCyc as a Semantic
<br>
Web Server, connected to a &quot;Knowledge Grid&quot; via a (super) peer-to-peer
<br>
network, in the remaining years of the project.
<br>
<p>My view is that achieving an AI will continue to be hard work, with
<br>
many false starts, dead-ends, refactorings and rewrites.  I dream that we
<br>
have the hardware now to create an AI, if only we could harness enough of
<br>
it -- with the right (seed) software.
<br>
<p>Regards to all,
<br>
-Steve
