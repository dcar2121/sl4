<p>
I really don't think so, Eliezer.
<br>
<p>FIRST:
<br>
I think that each of us has a LOT MORE DATA pertinent to the problem how to
<br>
please ourselves, than we do pertinent to the problem of how to please
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>You could argue that a community of AI's could gather data about how to
<br>
please each other by constantly monitoring each others' minds.  If this were
<br>
a major feature of their activities, though, it's not clear in what sense
<br>
one would really have a &quot;community of individual minds&quot; as opposed to a
<br>
&quot;group mind with semi-autonomous lobes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Similarly, you could argue that an advanced AI could study our brain
<br>
dynamics and structures to help figure out how to please us better.  Maybe
<br>
so.
<br>
<p><p>SECOND:
<br>
Even if the data regarding how to please others is accessible to an AI mind
<br>
by some futuristic method, there is a lot MORE data to be analyzed regarding
<br>
the &quot;please others&quot; problem than regarding the &quot;please self&quot; problem.
<br>
<p>Sometimes more data makes a problem easier, but in this case, I think the
<br>
&quot;more data&quot; is bound to kind of chaotic and conflicting, posing a HARDER
<br>
data analysis problem....
<br>
<p><p>THIRD:
<br>
Pleasing others may be much harder in the future than it is now, because
<br>
there may be a much larger diversity of minds out there (what with AI's of
<br>
various sorts, genetically modified humans, cyborgs, etc.).  Pleasing
<br>
everybody all the time will be even less feasible than it is now, it would
<br>
seem.
<br>
<p>Being Friendly to 10^20 different minds with totally different needs and
<br>
constructions, involved in an environment where they sometimes are in
<br>
competition, is not gonna be an easy thing at all.
<br>
<p>Yeah, you can argue that in the future all resource limitations will be
<br>
eliminated, which obviously would make the problem easier.  But this may be
<br>
overoptimistic!!
