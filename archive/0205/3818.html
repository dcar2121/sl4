<em>&gt;Subject: RE: [JOIN] Stephen Reed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Tue, 21 May 2002 17:18:56 -0600

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;In my opinion, Darpa is not yet ready to fund the Singularity mission,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;although as it gets closer, the US military will catch on first and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;provide funding before the commercial sector.  The safety of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;almost priceless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm curious about this statement. My gut feeling is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; military would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consider research aimed at the Singularity as something potentially very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *harmful* to the nation. If the research is successful, it would mean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; END of the government and the military. My feeling is also that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; great deal of narrow minded people in the government/military sector, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps are afraid of such a massive upheaval.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't you think that the military would use their funds to support AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intended for warfare instead of, say, Eliezer's Friendly AI project?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Have you yourself talked to people at DARPA (or other military programs)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the Singularity? If so, what was their reaction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The military will have its own slant on the Singularity.  It will put a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of $$ into AGI with the objective of getting there before anyone else, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the intuition that if there is going to be a major breakthrough that alters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nature of the world fundamentally, they want to be the ones steering 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not the &quot;bad guys.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This sounds reasonable, but isn't it likely that some people in the military 
<br>
would prefer if the nature of the world didn't change fundamentally? And 
<br>
would try to keep the world in its current state, even if this would be 
<br>
futile in the long run?
<br>
<p>Maybe my intuitions in this matter are shaped by too many bad Hollywood 
<br>
movies depicting the miliary as evil...
<br>
<p><p>A more likely scenario may be that the military funds narrow-field AIs, and 
<br>
not AGI. Most people don't think that the Singularity is likely within our 
<br>
lifetimes, and the military would not be an exception here I guess.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sure, it may not make any difference who steers the advent of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity.  And it may not make any difference whether one tries for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendly AGI or not either.  But the military, like Eliezer, will make its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best effort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't think the military will place a huge focus on Friendly AI, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suspect they will place more focus on defensive than offensive applications
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of AI.  Offensive applications would be too easily taken by enemies and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;against us.  Software is a lot easier for enemies to steal or copy than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;offensive weapons like nukes or fighter planes, say.
</em><br>
<p>This is a very good point. Agressive AI would probably be a very bad idea 
<br>
even if there was no risk of it being stolen...
<br>
