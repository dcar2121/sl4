</em><br>
<p><p>This is very literally true in a number of ways, though increasing
<br>
improbable as the size of the UP model increases in the most critical
<br>
sense. This leads me to an interesting thought worth bringing up. 
<br>
<p>Universal predictors of all types do not have a perfectly nice linear
<br>
relationship between their available resources, the complexity of the
<br>
problem, and the accuracy of their conclusions. &quot;Non-optimal&quot; UPs have
<br>
this same characteristic and cover a huge swath of design and
<br>
architecture for intelligent systems, encompassing just about everything
<br>
that would fall under the umbrella of AGI.  The value of a &quot;non-optimal&quot;
<br>
UPs in the real world is that under certain complexity constraints they
<br>
can give better results, but the accuracy of their results do not
<br>
converge as fast in the general case (i.e. when the complexity exceeds a
<br>
certain trivial level).
<br>
<p>Of specific interest, for every UP (&quot;optimal&quot; or not) it is possible to
<br>
construct a pattern (usually way out on the edge of the complexity limit
<br>
for a given predictor) that will break the universal predictor in such a
<br>
way that it makes conclusions/predictions WORSE than what you would
<br>
expect to get by random chance.  In a sense, there is a very narrow
<br>
boundary condition under which the predictor will behave in an
<br>
&quot;irrational&quot; manner. The larger the predictor, the more improbable it is
<br>
that you will find a pattern that can break the predictor by chance, but
<br>
such patterns exist nonetheless.  (Hey, this reminds me of GEB when they
<br>
discuss Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.)
<br>
<p>Implication: Any Friendliness theory for AGI that requires perfect
<br>
rationality cannot be guaranteed to stay Friendly. Ironically, the best
<br>
prophylactic for this (other than not doing it at all) would be to make
<br>
the AI as big as possible to make the probability of a &quot;psychotic
<br>
episode&quot; vanishingly small. 
<br>
<p>An opinion on this from a &quot;Friendliness&quot; expert (Eliezer?) would be
<br>
interesting.
<br>
<p>I just thought of this today so I haven't really thought it through, but
<br>
I don't see anything obviously wrong with my conclusion either. It would
<br>
seem that some level of irrationality is intrinsic to any workable model
<br>
for AGI (e.g. neural networks, AIC, etc).  It probably wouldn't manifest
<br>
itself as it does in humans, but an analog is certainly possible in any
<br>
such system.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Sure, but inadequate memory on a single machine can be turned into adequate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory on a distributed system, at the cost of accepting a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slowdown!
</em><br>
<p><p>This is quite correct, and getting more correct every day. As someone
<br>
who works at a company delivering obscene bandwidth to the masses, I
<br>
should know this as well as anyone. Throw in 64-bit OS and boxen, and
<br>
you can effectively have very large usable memories on the cheap. 
<br>
<p>One thing that I want to try doing is turning a solid-state disk array
<br>
(not cheap by any means, but a lot cheaper than buying a box that can
<br>
support and address, say, 128-Gb of RAM directly) and turning it into a
<br>
giant swap partition on a 64-bit box. The idea being that this is a back
<br>
door way to get really large blocks of addressable RAM without buying a
<br>
mainframe, while being a few orders of magnitude faster than a hard
<br>
drive.
<br>
