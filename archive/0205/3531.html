Quoting Max Comess (randomly)....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;KaZaa generates plenty of new subscribers all the time, and probably many of them will join Altnet.
</em><br>
<p>What has KaZaa got to do with SIAI ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; None of the magic can happen if the PFlops aren't there to run the AI/IA.
</em><br>
<p>Duh.... PFlops aren't 'really' the issue, RAM bandwidth is... And even if they were (the whole issue), you still said 'nothing' in that sentence.
<br>
Like yeah, maybe, nobody thought of it before *laughing*....What are you doing about it ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Essentially we have to take all these dumb AI and IA programs that run relatively slow at a few GFlops on individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;computers, and combine them and run them at ~PFlops on one massive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;distributed computer. 
</em><br>
<p>Combine them ? *WTF !* Agrrrh, you sound like a .Net zealot now....
<br>
What good is a HUGE 'combined' stupid piece of software for ?
<br>
How are you involved with distributed computing, p2p technologies etc..?
<br>
What technologies are you helping develop or did you help design/develop/implement ?
<br>
Hardware ? Software ? Just what do you do ? Which planet are you on ?
<br>
<p>PS: I feel like you're spamming me... I shall stand corrected if correction is needed. *smile* 
<br>
<p>The enthusiastic tone of your mail (by contrast with the actual content) makes you SOUND LIKE a bloody Jehovah Witness to me. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
<br>
And me who thought Spam was over on the Sl4 list *Arona rolls his eyes 2 or 3 times, remembering that geezer with his MindForth Tic-Tac-Toe 'real' AI project*
<br>
<p>PS2: You had that one coming for a week already. Last few weeks were 'nice Arona' weeks. It's over... go away...
<br>
<p>PS3: You could even be a bot, after all... That would explain it all.... *serious*
