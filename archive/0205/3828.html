<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>I got the book yesterday.  I skimmed it and read a few chapters carefully
<br>
(Chapters 1 and 2, and the chapters on Physics and Perception/Analysis).
<br>
Over the next few weeks I'll read the whole thing carefully.  Now I just
<br>
have a few preliminary observations:
<br>
<p>1) There seemed to be nothing in the book fundamentally conceptually new to
<br>
me.  However, there is much in the book that has been conceptually treated
<br>
only in various &quot;marginal&quot; places rather than in the scientific mainstream.
<br>
<p>2) What he has done, from my point of view, is to go through a LOT of ideas
<br>
from the complex systems literature and place them all within a common
<br>
framework of cellular-automaton-ish systems.  (Not all his dynamical systems
<br>
are strictly CA's, but most of them are either CA's or very similar).  This
<br>
allows a single book to discuss what otherwise would take 10 different
<br>
books, each involving a different notation and mathematical formalism.
<br>
<p>3) His physics approach is cool, but in my view no better (or worse) than
<br>
some other discrete physics approaches, such as Tony Smith's (even fringier)
<br>
&quot;Vodou Physics&quot; model [There is a lot of cool stuff on Tony's website, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/TShome.html">http://www.innerx.net/personal/tsmith/TShome.html</a> ]
<br>
<p>4) His treatment of perception and analysis is conceptually fine, but very
<br>
limited and does not even come close to being pragmatically useful for AI
<br>
<p>5) His discussion of biological pattern-formation is a repeat, in somewhat
<br>
more elegant form, of a lot of old ideas from the systems theory literature.
<br>
For instance, A. Lima de Faria's old book &quot;Evolution without Selection&quot;
<br>
makes the same conceptual points (along with other more controversial ones)
<br>
but without the numerous CA and quasi-CA examples.
<br>
<p><p>Is it progress?  Yeah.  It's nice to have a common formalism (CA's and
<br>
quasi-CA's) for dealing with all these diverse complex-systems phenomena.
<br>
<p>Is it a new kind of science?  Maybe.  But it's not *that* new -- it's
<br>
&quot;complex systems science&quot; which has been gathering steam for a while.
<br>
<p>MAYBE his CA-ish formalism will prove powerful enough to make complex
<br>
systems science into a &quot;real science&quot;, but this book does not demonstrate
<br>
that, because it doesn't really come to any dramatic and definitive
<br>
scientific conclusions in any particular branch of science.
<br>
<p>He admits that the truly revolutionary nature of his approach will only be
<br>
seen in 10-20 years.  Maybe so.
<br>
<p>I think that maybe the reason he doesn't agree that most of his *concepts*
<br>
are old ones, is that he thinks he's gotten them &quot;right&quot;.  Whereas to me it
<br>
just seems like he's said familiar things a little *differently*.
<br>
<p>The big problem is, given a complex system you want to build, or a complex
<br>
phenomenon you want to analyze, how do you go about constructing a CA-ish
<br>
model of it?  (By intuition based on other examples, is his method, it
<br>
seems.)  And if the CA-ish model you find just *qualitatively* but not
<br>
exactly models the phenomenon or realizes the behavior, how useful is it?
<br>
<p>Finding a CA-ish model to *exactly* model a given collection of data about a
<br>
given system or set of systems, is a problem of function learning
<br>
approachable via GP-type methods, but he doesn't go there...
<br>
<p>I certainly look forward to reading the book more fully, as there is much to
<br>
be learned from the details in the other chapters I haven't yet read
<br>
carefully I'm sure...
<br>
