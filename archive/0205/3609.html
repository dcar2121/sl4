<em>&gt;In case it wasn't evident from context, this message was intended for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eliezer
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so, but it does raise an interesting point.
<br>
<p>See, I've always been perplexed by something. Most people seem to identify 
<br>
and categorize concepts and thought-complexes(what most people jargonize 
<br>
into meme-plexes or paradigms) very very differently than I do.
<br>
<p>I was on the sidelines for this exchange wondering to myself what Eliezer 
<br>
would make of the fact that I spend much of my life with a 'silent' mind. 
<br>
There aren't any named concepts or thought streams running through my head. 
<br>
Just virtual-kinesthetic feelings. It's only when I switch on what I think 
<br>
of as my analytic mind (or occasionally I turn on an internal narrator for 
<br>
preciseness) that the inside of my head gets noisy.
<br>
<p>I have repeatable used concepts that I can't think about in English without 
<br>
confusing myself. For example, (I have to kind of explain around this, so 
<br>
bear with me) in some situations a certain confluence of factors (people, 
<br>
activities, objects) give a 'directionality'(for lack of a better term, to 
<br>
events around me. I've learned to rely on this directionality in order to 
<br>
skew social dynamics in my preferred direction. Strangely, the best metaphor 
<br>
I can come up with is the way I can sense intent when sparring or fighting 
<br>
with someone(particularly kendo and fencing).
<br>
This feeling actually had me convinced for a while that I was 
<br>
psychic(embarrassing experiments in my early teens to follow).
<br>
<p>Other people don't seem to have structures like this.
<br>
<p>Yet others have structures that I have difficulty understanding. I have a 
<br>
friend that can't think about music without categorizing it by it's 'shape'. 
<br>
(Most Bach materializes as green polyhedrons, apparently) I have another 
<br>
friend who has internal invented words for smells!!!
<br>
<p>This sort of variance in internal thought life really creeps me out, and 
<br>
makes me think that introspection on the subject of cognitive science may be 
<br>
really really wrong.
<br>
<p>Some time ago now(yipes I'm getting old, nostalgia, run! ) I devised a 
<br>
metric for determining internal cognitive process based on some simple 
<br>
selectors. It was intended to be plugged into customized learning protocols 
<br>
I had designed. Some of the learning tests was surprisingly effective. We 
<br>
had kids speaking russian and italian way ahead of median learning curves, 
<br>
and I broke several people's problems with learning advanced geometry. We 
<br>
didn't exactly had new Euclids running around, but it was impressive to our 
<br>
investors, anyway.(One of the test cases was an investor's kid who 
<br>
beforehand had been flunking algebra I)
<br>
<p>What we learned from our experiments is that Internal modeling of concepts 
<br>
is sometimes bizarrely varied between people, and that the modeling of said 
<br>
concepts is often a bottleneck in learning. Translation is a bitch.
<br>
<p>One of our more repeatable conclusions is that the best 'generalized' 
<br>
learners were those who could use generic mental structures to the greatest 
<br>
effect. Particularly those who used mental object analogy, and visual 
<br>
categorization specifically.
<br>
<p>Anyways, didn't mean to ramble too much, but this kind of plugs into the 
<br>
wordless concept debate here.
<br>
<p>notes:
<br>
<p>-I did at one point have a bit of investor money lined up for an 
<br>
experimental accelerated learning program for a small sample population, 
<br>
based on my research, and some example projects the team had.
<br>
<p>-Yes, I did this in high school. I was frustrated by my lack of ability in 
<br>
some areas, and originally approached this as a self improvement project 
<br>
that snowballed. I unfortunately was never able to helpfully categorize my 
<br>
own mental gymnastics. So my learning is as slow as ever. I still believe 
<br>
that if I could get someone competent trained in the system I designed, an 
<br>
accurate profile could be designed, and my various learning disabilities and 
<br>
disconnects could be corrected, But in the meantime, tough cookies.
<br>
<p>-I apologize to anyone I've been corresponding to, and the people who've 
<br>
been getting emotional and nonsensical emails, or none at all. I'm in the 
<br>
midst of kind of a familial tragedy, and most of my projects and 
<br>
correspondence have been derailed. (which is probably also why I'm rambling 
<br>
about one of my most beloved and failed attempts.)(Spectacular failure, 
<br>
really)
<br>
<p><p>Anyway, Questions to Ponder:
<br>
<p>1. Do these mental-object differences imply significant neuroanatomical 
<br>
differences between people? (we never really investigated it, we didn't have 
<br>
the expertise or the time. We were more about what worked, than why)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1A. Does that matter at all, if it does?
<br>
<p>2. What impact on artificial minds does this difference entail?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2A. Are these neccesary differences, or can they be ignored?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2B. Do these differences convey significant advantages in cognitive 
<br>
processing that an artifical minds may take advantage of?
<br>
<p><p>alrighty, back to your normally scheduled Ben vs. Eli AI-athon:

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One more thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am quite perplexed by your notion that concepts need to be *named* to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't you believe in content-addressable memory???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is one of the design principles that Novamente inherits from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attractor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neural nets (ANN's), actually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Semantic nets, which you dislike, involve addressing concepts by name.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ANN's involve addressing concepts by *specifying part of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contents* or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *specifying a collection of related entities*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In Novamente (an integrative design), *some* concepts are addressable by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; name, but *all* concepts are addressable ANN-style (because concepts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; represented by &quot;maps&quot;, which are much like attractors in ANN's).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
