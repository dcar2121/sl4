<br>
Cycorp is fairly well known but as an employee I can tell our story from
<br>
the perspective of the members of this mail list.  We are working hard to
<br>
create a real AI.  Along the way we have created a solid deductive
<br>
inference engine, the world's largest commonsense knowledge base,
<br>
incorporated a planner, and with a staff of computational linguists, made
<br>
a good start towards a hookup of Natural Language processing and the Cyc
<br>
KB.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>Welcome to the list!  I am very pleased to see someone from the Cyc project 
<br>
join up!
<br>
<p>I have studied Cyc somewhat closely -- I taught CycL in my AI class this 
<br>
semester; and talked to Lenat as well as the Cycorp CEO (I forget his name 
<br>
at the moment!) about a year ago, when I was considering the possibility of 
<br>
going to work there.
<br>
<p>But I decided the &quot;philosophical mismatch&quot; was too great... and I think 
<br>
they decided so as well... we both kind of let the conversation drop...
<br>
<p>I think the Cyc database will be a useful resource for an AGI someday, but 
<br>
I personally don't have much optimism that the AI approach being taken at 
<br>
Cycorp is going to lead to an AGI of any robustness and real generality, 
<br>
flexibility and creativity....
<br>
<p>My main objection is not to the CycL language -- I would use a different 
<br>
knowledge representation formalism, but the CycL language is largely 
<br>
convertible into the formalisms I prefer.
<br>
<p>I'd frame my main objections as follows:
<br>
<p>1) The knowledge being entered to the Cyc DB in is of a fairly restricted 
<br>
nature, by and large.  Crisp, clean propositions about named concepts are 
<br>
useful but may not get you that far in terms of representing all the 
<br>
knowledge needed by a mind.  Compared to the knowledge in Cyc, I think that 
<br>
most knowledge in a real mind is either
<br>
<p>a) a lot more closely grounded in perception and action, OR
<br>
b) a lot more abstract and nebulous, involving complex concepts that are 
<br>
difficult to name in single words or brief phrases.
<br>
<p>These types of knowledge are hard for human encoders to encode in explicit 
<br>
formulas, even though *in principle* they can be expressed in logical form.
<br>
<p>2) I don't like the way you represent uncertainty in CycL.  Compared to 1, 
<br>
this is a very minor conceptual point.  But I think that imposing a Bayes 
<br>
net on each small, localized subset of knowledge just doesn't come close to 
<br>
capturing the way uncertainty is used in the human mnd, or must be used in 
<br>
any robust AGI.  For one thing, I think that a single-number truth value 
<br>
won't do it; for another thing, I think that the dag structure of a Bayes 
<br>
net is too restrictive for a lot of knowledge domains.  I don't think that 
<br>
one pdf can be imposed on the whole knowledge base of a mind, nor do I 
<br>
think that the mind can be segmented into little sections and a pdf imposed 
<br>
on each one.  I think that richer information about uncertainty must be 
<br>
stored, and this must be used to construct pdf's on the fly, in a 
<br>
goal-directed way, in the course of reasoning.
<br>
<p>3)  I worry that the predicate logic based reasoning engines you guys have 
<br>
are far too &quot;brittle&quot; and not adequate to carrying out creative, complex 
<br>
trains of thought that lead significantly beyond what's explicitly there in 
<br>
the axioms.  This is the area I know least about, because there is not as 
<br>
much published on Cycorp's reasoning engines as on CycL.  I think that any 
<br>
approach that takes logical reasoning as the center of mental activity, and 
<br>
views other things as ancillary to logical reasoning, is bound to fail.  I 
<br>
think that a reasoning engine has to be designed based on its behavior 
<br>
*integrated with other mental subsystems* such as imaginative concept 
<br>
creation, context-appropriate control of inference and concept creation, 
<br>
communication, noninferential association formation, etc.  Of course I 
<br>
understand that Lenat and others on the Cyc team have *thought* about these 
<br>
things, but my impression is that the vast majority of work has gone into 
<br>
logical inference, and I think this is very unlikely to lead to an infer  
<br>
ence engine that will work properly in the context of a whole mind.  (I 
<br>
could go on about this point in a huge amount of detail, of course -- it 
<br>
leads to a lot of very interesting technical issues -- but this is intended 
<br>
to be a brief e-mail)
<br>
<p>4) Regarding NLP, it is good that Cyc is finally taking an interest in 
<br>
this.  When my friend Karin Verspoor, a computational linguist, interviewed 
<br>
there about 5 years ago, there seemed to be no significant work in this 
<br>
direction going on at Cycorp (hence she took a different job, at M$ 
<br>
Research in fact).   I can see how Cyc is well positioned to exceed current 
<br>
computational NLP approaches, by hybridizing (now-)standard corpus 
<br>
linguistics approaches with lookups into the Cyc DB.  This can be very 
<br>
helpful for such things as semantic disambiguation, reference resolution of 
<br>
various sorts, etc.  However, I think that getting the semantic/syntax 
<br>
interface right (the hard part of NLP) is not possible in a system that 
<br>
focuses so narrowly on *logical inference from crisp or (Bayes net) 
<br>
probabilistic propositions about named concepts*.  I think that a lot of 
<br>
the syntax/semantics interface has to be done by *a combination of logical 
<br>
inference with other cognitive processes*, acting on *crisp, concise 
<br>
propositions about named concepts, together with knowledge more closely 
<br>
grounded in perception/action, together with more abstract and nebulous 
<br>
intuitive knowledge*.
<br>
<p><p>Of course, one reaction you might have to this is &quot;Sure, I kind of agree 
<br>
with your points, but our current system is not supposed to be a true AGI, 
<br>
just a partway-there system....  We're approaching the problem from the 
<br>
direction of 'crisp, concise propositions about named concepts' and 
<br>
'logical inference with predicate logic &amp; bayesian probabilities'.   We 
<br>
know we're far from a true AGI, but so is everybody else, and we think what 
<br>
we're doing now may be a good platform for future work in directions 
<br>
similar to the ones you suggest.&quot;
<br>
<p>If this is your reaction, then what I would like to see is a paper or book 
<br>
addressing the &quot;grand Cyc vision&quot; -- i.e. what do you (or Lenat etc.) 
<br>
envision Cyc (the database and the AI system) looking like in, say, 5-20 
<br>
years, when you have overcome limitations like the ones I've cited above 
<br>
and made a more fully fleshed out AI system?  Are there internal Cycorp 
<br>
documents addressing this sort of thing?
<br>
<p>In terms of my own work, I think the Cyc DB could potentially be 
<br>
interesting to feed into Novamente (my own AI system, which is more 
<br>
integrative in nature and less strictly focused on logic, although it does 
<br>
have a probabilistic inference component; see www.realai.net for some 
<br>
nontechnical info).   I suspect I could also learn something from the way 
<br>
you've specialized Cyc's inference engines to deal with particular types of 
<br>
information, even though Novamente's inference engine does not use a 
<br>
predicate logic foundation.
