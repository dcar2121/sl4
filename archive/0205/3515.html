I guess my intuition is that Gaia is more like a &quot;lower animal&quot; than it is 
<br>
like a human.  I agree that it has the analogues of biological homeostatis, 
<br>
but I'm dubious that it has the analogues of focused attention, logical &amp; 
<br>
linguistic thought, etc.
<br>
<p>The question I have is, how would you propose to empirically determine 
<br>
whether Gaia in some sense has these advanced cognitive aspects?
<br>
<p>And if Gaia did have them, and wanted to push toward a Singularity, what do 
<br>
you think it would be doing in this direction?  It doesn't seem to me like 
<br>
the rise of technology has a lot to do with the general biological surround 
<br>
of humanity.  William Calvin has argued that the alternation of ice ages 
<br>
with non ice ages was critical for the rise of human intelligence, so 
<br>
perhaps this sort of long term intelligence-supportive climate change could 
<br>
be viewed as &quot;the Gaia-mind acting to push toward the Singularity&quot; in some 
<br>
sense.
<br>
<p>But still, if there is a Gaia-mind, I doubt it has concepts like &quot;Singul  
<br>
arity&quot; or &quot;technology&quot; at all... changes on our level would likely be the 
<br>
manifestation of TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED changes on its level...

<p>Ben says:
<br>
<em>&gt;To say &quot;the Gaia conscious being is purposefully working toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity&quot; may be to export a lot of the human concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;purposefulness&quot; to a radically non-human domain in a not very appropriate
</em><br>
<p>It isn't much of a stretch to attribute &quot;purposefulness&quot; to an intelligent
<br>
conscious being.  The question is whether it is conscious and intelligent.
<br>
<p>Ben mentions his intuition that it is slow and concerned with only
<br>
environmental maintenance.  My intuition is that environmental concerns are
<br>
analogous to maintaining homeostasis of blood pressure and temperature in
<br>
our bodies.  And if you were the size of a bacterium this is what you would
<br>
see as our behavior, missing the fact that we are piloting a plane from
<br>
Boise to Denver.  We have a conception problem because of scale and as Ben
<br>
says, the fact that it is so different.  To assume a low slow level of
<br>
intelligence because we can't see purposeful behavior while discounting
<br>
possible evidence (drive to Singularity) could be one conclusion jumped too
<br>
far.
