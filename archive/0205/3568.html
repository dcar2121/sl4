<p>
My own view is that, even if the Singularity is consciously pushed along by
<br>
a self-modifying intelligence in a hard-takeoff scenario, it will *still*
<br>
have &quot;many aspects that are not consciously
<br>
chosen and that are suboptimal from the perspective of the intelligences
<br>
swept along by the system.&quot;
<br>
<p>You seem to be assuming that the seed AI is effectively omniscient during
<br>
the hard takeoff process.  I suspect it won't be; I suspect it will be very
<br>
very smart compared to us but not omniscient.  And perhaps the complex
<br>
dynamics of society and technology as the Singularity unfolds will be beyond
<br>
even *its* capability to comprehend fully.
<br>
<p>To my way of thinking , in the hard takeoff scenario, the seed AI is alive
<br>
and is orchestrating but not fully controlling nor comprehending the
<br>
Singularity.  The Singularity is a series of events taking place over time,
<br>
rather than a specific system that one can say is alive or not.  Perhaps the
<br>
total mass of minds on earth, considered as a whole, could be considered a
<br>
&quot;living system&quot;, in which case the Singularity is a particular phase in the
<br>
life of this living system... still the Singularity is not &quot;alive&quot; in
<br>
itself.  It seems to me that this way of thinking is more agreeable with
<br>
YOUR OWN definition of &quot;alive&quot; than is your statement that &quot;the Singularity
<br>
is alive.&quot;
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In some scenarios, the Singularity takes its pattern from nonintentional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes - the versions of the Singularity where it's the inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergent output of a whole species and so on.  But in the hard takeoff
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model, which is the one I think most likely, the Singularity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process like an economy, which has many aspects that are not consciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chosen and that are suboptimal from the perspective of the intelligences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swept along by the system.  The Singularity is created by the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improving mind to undergo a hard takeoff; this doesn't imply that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others are left out, but it does mean that the qualities of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are there because a mind chose them.  If the Singularity takes its shape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from intelligence and is implemented by intelligence, I would argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the Singularity is ALIVE&quot; is a better metaphor than &quot;the Singularity is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PROCESS&quot;.
