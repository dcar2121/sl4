<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In my opinion, Darpa is not yet ready to fund the Singularity mission,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;although as it gets closer, the US military will catch on first and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;provide funding before the commercial sector.  The safety of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;almost priceless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm curious about this statement. My gut feeling is that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider research aimed at the Singularity as something potentially very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *harmful* to the nation. If the research is successful, it would mean the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; END of the government and the military. My feeling is also that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great deal of narrow minded people in the government/military sector, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps are afraid of such a massive upheaval.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't you think that the military would use their funds to support AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intended for warfare instead of, say, Eliezer's Friendly AI project?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you yourself talked to people at DARPA (or other military programs)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the Singularity? If so, what was their reaction?
</em><br>
<p><p>The military will have its own slant on the Singularity.  It will put a lot
<br>
of $$ into AGI with the objective of getting there before anyone else, on
<br>
the intuition that if there is going to be a major breakthrough that alters
<br>
the nature of the world fundamentally, they want to be the ones steering it,
<br>
not the &quot;bad guys.&quot;
<br>
<p>Sure, it may not make any difference who steers the advent of the
<br>
Singularity.  And it may not make any difference whether one tries for
<br>
Friendly AGI or not either.  But the military, like Eliezer, will make its
<br>
best effort.
<br>
<p>I don't think the military will place a huge focus on Friendly AI, but I
<br>
suspect they will place more focus on defensive than offensive applications
<br>
of AI.  Offensive applications would be too easily taken by enemies and used
<br>
against us.  Software is a lot easier for enemies to steal or copy than
<br>
offensive weapons like nukes or fighter planes, say.  There is a huge risk
<br>
in developing aggressive software -- all it takes is one spy programmer to
<br>
give the code to China, and then we may have an enemy on our hands with
<br>
exactly the same software.  For this reason I suspect that developing AGI
<br>
aimed at national defense in the literal sense will be a much bigger
<br>
priority.  I don't think we care as much if China pirates our defensive AGI,
<br>
not nearly as much as if they steal our killer AGI.
