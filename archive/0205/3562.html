Anyone really interested in the 'puzzle' of (free) intelligent choice may
<br>
want to read an old essay of mine: <a href="http://www.optimal.org/peter/freewill.htm">http://www.optimal.org/peter/freewill.htm</a>
<br>
<p>And, Ben , I totally agree with you that a high-level intelligence can be
<br>
seen (and understood) both from the perspective of 'moral philosopher' &amp;
<br>
'nonlinear dynamical system'. It's a certain kind of nonlinear dynamics that
<br>
gives rise to (ie. *is*) the ability to philosophize.

<br>
Of Ben Goertzel
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Is a complex nonlinear dynamical system really the right way to look at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI?  This is an intelligent being we're talking about, capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making choices.
</em><br>
<p>I do think that minds are *necessarily* complex nonlinear dynamical systems.
<br>
This is an intuition, I certainly haven't proved it.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;capable of making choices&quot;, this comment opens up a huge
<br>
philosophical debate.  As you know the neurophysiological evidence
<br>
(Gazzaniga etc.) is that most of our &quot;felt conscious choices&quot; are actually
<br>
determined by unconscious processes.  List members who don't know this work
<br>
should look up Gazzaniga's split-brain experiments, which are terribly
<br>
convincing in this regard.
<br>
<p>So I think what we call &quot;choice&quot; is a pretty complex nonlinear dynamical
<br>
phenomenon itself.  Nietzsche said, &quot;Consciousness is like the general who
<br>
takes responsibility for the spontaneous actions of his troops.&quot;  This is a
<br>
lot though not all of the story.  Consciousness also, by fallaciously taking
<br>
responsibility for decisions it did not in any real sense make, provides a
<br>
valuable role of clarifying and crystallizing the nature of decisions that
<br>
the unconscious has already made.  I think Nietzsche knew this but did not
<br>
emphasize it.  The general, when he takes credit for what the troops did,
<br>
explains clearly what the troops did, in a way that may help the troops to
<br>
spontaneously and self-organizingly do even better things next time.
<br>
<p>....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there is an intelligence, in fact a transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, standing behind it and making choices.
</em><br>
<p>The half-illusion of &quot;choice&quot; is, in my view, a complex nonlinear dynamical
<br>
process itself
