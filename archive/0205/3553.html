Hi,
<br>
<p>Here is my take on these things, which is not the same as Eliezer's of
<br>
course.
<br>
<p>As anyone who has worked with complex nonlinear dynamical systems knows,
<br>
predicting the stability of a complex system from first principles is a very
<br>
hard problem.  There is a very high probability that our intuitions about
<br>
these things are going to be wrong.  All we are giving are heuristic
<br>
arguments.  Heuristic arguments about weather systems and their stability
<br>
were quite popular, until in the 70's Lorenz's older work on chaotic
<br>
dynamics in weather systems became well-known.  Now that we know there is
<br>
some chaos there, we still can't make detailed predictions of the stability
<br>
or other dynamical properties of given weather systems.  I suspect that the
<br>
real study of stability and other dynamical properties of goal systems will
<br>
not begin until we have AI's of, say, chimp intelligence to experiment with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. Are there supergoals other than Friendliness that can be stable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SI's?
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that pure selfishness would probably be a pretty stable goal.
<br>
In fact my intuition says this one would be less susceptible to drift than
<br>
Friendliness, because of its greater simplicity.  Estimating the
<br>
Friendliness of an action is harder than estimating the selfish benefit of
<br>
an action, so there's more room for drift in Friendliness IMO.
<br>
<p>But of course, this is just an intuition...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. If the answer to question 1 is yes, will the first SI created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have the supergoal of Friendliness? Given that for most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfishness is a stronger motivation than altruism, how will Eliezer get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient funding before someone more selfish manages to create an SI?
</em><br>
<p>The selfishness of the individual creating the AI is not necessarily
<br>
correlated with the selfishness of the AI.  A selfish person might well
<br>
create an AI that valued humans over itself -- while putting in a special
<br>
clause to make it value its creator most of all!
