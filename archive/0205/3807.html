<em>&gt; Don't you think that the military would use their funds to support AI 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>As I understand Friendly AI, especially regarding &quot;unity of will&quot; between
<br>
the FAI and its programmers/knowledge engineers, then the military would
<br>
create a FAI along the lines Eliezer proposes.  You want an AGI on your
<br>
side, the *right* side, and it needs to know why, in a very deep sense.
<br>
For example, Darpa and other government funding agencies are seeking ways
<br>
to improve our intelligence: the Information Awareness project will sort
<br>
through massive data and identify those nuggets of information which, 
<br>
when known, could forestall an adversary's attack.  Good intelligence is
<br>
the least expensive defense.  Think about how a FAI could assist our
<br>
Intelligence Community where the most scarce resource is the skilled human
<br>
analyst.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have you yourself talked to people at DARPA (or other military programs) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the Singularity? If so, what was their reaction?
</em><br>
<p>Mainly that we are crackpots.  
<br>
<p>Darpa/(ARPA) has funded AI/Nanotech from the start and senior project
<br>
managers there don't expect to see real AI in their careers at Darpa. 
<br>
<p>But don't see that the wrong way. In fact it is to be expected and easily
<br>
understood from the perspective of history.  Think about the Wright 
<br>
brothers showing the US Army their Flyer.  Think about Gattling showing
<br>
the Army his machine gun in the Civil War.  But give the military a 
<br>
concrete indication of what can happen with funding in the next
<br>
budget/deployment schedule and much can happen fast. It took Einstein to
<br>
get the government moving on the A-Bomb after there was proof of the
<br>
Uranium chain reaction.. billions were spent from precious war resources.
<br>
<p>I expect that this forum, and others attracted to this vocation in the
<br>
near future, will create software providing glimpses of AGI behavior,
<br>
perhaps on vast clusters of existing hardware (my ambition), or on
<br>
supercomputers.  
<br>
<p>You can simulate the hardware environment of the future by massive
<br>
concentration of computer power today.  Each 10x growth in your complex is 
<br>
roughly equivalent to one equivalent unit 4.5 years in the future
<br>
according to Moore's law.  My guess is that about 40,000 AMD 64 bit
<br>
computers (on the market next year) could be enough to deliver
<br>
the computer power that a single computer might have in 2023. Suppose
<br>
that someone's AGI software next year could harness the power of that
<br>
many AMD-64 computers and show the government that the Singularity has
<br>
evidence of happening.  Then the funding would follow; the proper research
<br>
protocols put in place - in my opinion.
<br>
<p>The key with government funding, and to a lesser degree commercial funding,
<br>
and the reason why I mention Cycorp's sponsors (as an example to others
<br>
here), is that you need not claim AGI as your ultimate goal. You do not
<br>
even have to claim that you are making steps towards AGI in the
<br>
future.  You need only claim the tools you have now, or can extend with
<br>
sponsor's funding, are useful, unique, having AI qualities that sets them
<br>
apart from all other software systems.  Cycorp claims only to have the
<br>
worlds largest commonsense knowledge base, and a useful reference
<br>
ontology.  These attributes set us apart from all other software systems
<br>
now, and are useful to our government sponsors.  Our business model is to
<br>
accept government funding for interesting projects that advance our AI
<br>
goals as a *side effect*.  You get your first government contract on a
<br>
great presentation, but you get subsequent contracts only by satisfying
<br>
the managers of your previous projects.
<br>
<p>When there is strong evidence that the Singularity is possible, then we
<br>
propose projects, seek sponsors to achieve that goal in a public
<br>
(non-classified), regulated fashion - again just my opinion.
