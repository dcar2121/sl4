What exactly is it that you object to. I know I don't write beautiful well
<br>
thought out compositions but this isn't an English class. I've always had
<br>
trouble in communicating, in fact I have a DX'd communications disorder;
<br>
Asperger's Syndrome. Personally I'd rather DO something to bring the
<br>
singularity about, rather then just write about it, and since I don't have
<br>
the knowledge to write AI software, what I can do is attempt to inform
<br>
people about what is going on.
<br>
<p>The biggest problem with this field is that it is fractured into hundreds of
<br>
different groups, each working on their own project, and not communicating,
<br>
except, seemingly, by well written papers in MLA format in academic
<br>
journals.  We don't need any more papers. We need plex. Lots of them. And
<br>
what people do write in &quot;standard&quot; format should be massively hyperlinked,
<br>
rather then forcing the reader to pore over any number of well written
<br>
lengthy paragraphs searching for what they really want to see.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I've been using theBrain for a while and I can tell you what a difference
<br>
it makes in terms of quick and easy access to information, and I think that
<br>
everyone who is working towards a common goal should have a common place to
<br>
facilitate advances. Think about what would happen if all those who worked
<br>
on AI software used nothing but the latest GUI based programs in their
<br>
development, instead of the standard Crappy Limited Interface (CLI), that so
<br>
many are using now.
