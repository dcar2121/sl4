Let me go on record saying that MITECS is a wonderful resource, and I dont' 
<br>
know where I'd be without it. For those not fortunate to possess the power 
<br>
Google Without Error;
<br>
<p><a href="http://cognet.mit.edu/MITECS">http://cognet.mit.edu/MITECS</a>
<br>
<p>partial text available to all. You can get fulltext access by buying the 
<br>
book, or subscribing to cognet. I highly recommend it, as it's fully 
<br>
searchable, and contains good internet links.

<em>&gt;HELP!  I'm reading the MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science in order &gt;to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better understand the basis for Eliezer's ideas on GAI design.  &gt;I've read 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through the introduction and am ready to start on the &gt;articles.  But they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are in alphabetical order which is great if you &gt;know what you are looking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for, which I don't.  From reading the intro, &gt;I get a feeling that there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lot of unrelated stuff in here that I &gt;could skip.  If you could point me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the right direction I would &gt;really appreciate it.
</em><br>
<p>I would recommend reading the introductions to the sections. They're very 
<br>
informative, and give one better direction for finding what's interesting to 
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>Eli's method has it's own merits, of course. It is a book of knowledge. And 
<br>
like all such books, there's really no bad way to learn from it.
<br>
<p>The important thing is, as MITECS is a reference work, to determine what it 
<br>
is you want to learn from it. If you're looking for context in which to 
<br>
interpret AI work, read AI articles. If you're looking for grounding in 
<br>
something, read through the introduction to it, and start chugging through 
<br>
the section.
<br>
<p>if anyone is interested, I'll loan you my fulltext access password, just so 
<br>
you can evaluate the use of the online text. I find it very useful, but your 
<br>
mileage may vary.
<br>
<p>Such things deserve to be supported, however free information wants to be.
