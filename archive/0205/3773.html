Justin,
<br>
<p>Balancing one's efforts on fundraising with one's efforts on doing actual 
<br>
work, is not an easy problem.
<br>
<p>On the one hand, once one has substantial funding, one can get work done 
<br>
faster
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the more of a working system one can demonstrate, or the 
<br>
more of a detailed design one can describe (with explanations of why it can 
<br>
do what one claims), the easier fundraising becomes.
<br>
<p>For this reason, everyone pursuing stuff like this balances their time 
<br>
between the two pursuits, and the optimal balance is not clear, so personal 
<br>
preference plays a big role each person's decision.
<br>
<p>You mention VC and angel investor funding, but these are for business 
<br>
propositions; for building an AGI, in a down  market, there is no way to 
<br>
get significant business funding.  In the height of the Net bubble it was 
<br>
possible, because business investors were thinking long-term.  Now, the 
<br>
plausible sources of funding for AGI are private philanthropists and 
<br>
government grants, basically.
<br>
<p>Of course, both in a business and in a nonprofit context, the primary 
<br>
source of funding leads is *personal contacts*.  I bet that, within the 
<br>
social circles of everyone on this list, there are loads of possible 
<br>
funding sources.  If anyone feels the inspiration, do some brainstorming in 
<br>
this regard and then contact me, Eliezer or Peter ;&gt;   Eliezer is only 
<br>
interested in philanthropic donations or research grants, whereas Peter and 
<br>
I are interested in both these things, and commercial investments.  I am 
<br>
not sure what Peter's business model is; currently, in addition to our 
<br>
general AGI work, my team is focusing on bioinformatic data analysis, an 
<br>
area that is not so hot in the VC community this year, but that I feel will 
<br>
bounce back in the next 12-24 months (the biotech market generally being 
<br>
cyclical).

<p>Ben, Eli
<br>
Hi.
<br>
<p>There are a couple others on this list with AGI or software projects in the 
<br>
works, but these are the two that I'm aware of, and have researched a bit.
<br>
<p>Now, the occasionally philosophic tussling between you two aside, you're
<br>
both rather close to each other in Goals, difficulties and so on.
<br>
<p>So, my question is, what to do about money?
<br>
<p>I have very limited experience in this arena. I've funded one project, and
<br>
had enough money to get it through initial stages, but the project itself
<br>
flopped for different reasons. Plus, we got very lucky, getting funded the
<br>
way we did. It nearly fell into our lap.
<br>
<p>But it seems that funding such projects should be first priority. Because
<br>
money is power, and increased money leads to increased rate of development. 
<br>
So if you blitz, get word and so on into the VC community, and out to Angel 
<br>
investors, and stuff, and double your income, the net effect could be
<br>
greater than if you spent all that time working on more &quot;AIish stuff&quot;.
<br>
Because the influx of money gets you increased equipment, staff, and
<br>
support. thus allowing you to work faster and better. (presumably)
<br>
<p>This is a rather recent thought of mine, so excuse the &quot;It's so obvious&quot;
<br>
quality. It's why I'm spending more time improving my situation than on my
<br>
projects right now. Because if I can bootstrap myself into a decent
<br>
financial situation, I'll have more to work with. Previously, I've had
<br>
something of a bohemian meme running around my head, saying &quot;money is bad,
<br>
productive work is work spent on a idealogically pure perspective&quot;! The
<br>
problem is that whoring around for money first allows you to achieve the
<br>
actual goal faster, even if you lose the comfortable feeling of only 
<br>
working
<br>
on Good things. And that's better.
<br>
<p>Presumably.
<br>

<br>
&quot;We can rebuild him, we have the technology, make him faster, stronger,
<br>
better than before...&quot;
