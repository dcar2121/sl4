IBM is very much into Moore's Law and they run their R&amp;D side with this in
<br>
mind.  They have done their own charting of the future, which parallels and
<br>
perhaps exceeds Kurzweil's in both detail and optimism.  But the people who
<br>
lead their R&amp;D are absolutely not &quot;AI true believers&quot;.
<br>
<p>M$ would seem to be in the same boat.  Bill Gates is a fan of &quot;global brain&quot;
<br>
type thinking and of limited AI paradigms such as bayesian nets, but not of
<br>
AI on the grand scale.
<br>
<p>Basically, no one in a research leadership position in contemporary American
<br>
business seems to be terribly optimistic as regards the potential imminence
<br>
of real AI and the potential of Moore's Law (and related growth curves) to
<br>
help enable this.
<br>
<p>They have been burned too many times by the &quot;AI is just around the corner&quot;
<br>
story, so that even though they're doing R&amp;D aimed 10 years out, they're
<br>
still not including AGI in the picture
<br>
<p>Of course this could change next year....  I'm guessing that it will not
<br>
change until one of the current crop of fringy AI projects has some kind of
<br>
widely publicized success, but perhaps this is pessimistic and change will
<br>
come due to the politicking of AGI advocates within these organizations, who
<br>
do exist.

<p><p><p><em>&gt; Mike Deering: I agree with your enthusiastic assessment that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Underground AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BIG BIG BIG!&quot;, but I very much doubt that corporations like IBM$
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and M$ are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing anything other than GOFAI.  These are incredibly conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations, who would see zero benefit (more precisely, zero profit) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating a self-improving AI.  I strongly suspect that the groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IBM$ and M$ R&amp;D decisions are sufficiently smart and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well-informed enough to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realise that the very first real self-improving AI that has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard (or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soft) take off, will cause their corporate reason-for-existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to evaporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like spilled ether.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for Deep Blue being a parlour trick... not exactly... it was designed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceived and executed with one purpose in mind: to improve IBM's image in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to create more profit.  (And, by the way, it worked!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One last thing, Mike Deering: your short stories Kick Butt!  B^D
