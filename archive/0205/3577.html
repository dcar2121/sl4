<p>
I now have enough information to offer preliminary reviews of Novamente and
<br>
A2I2.
<br>
<p>First, though, a disclaimer:  I am not a venture capitalist or an expert on
<br>
the AI market.  When I analyze Ben's AI I am holding it to the standard of
<br>
the Singularity, because Ben has expressed a belief that Novamente occupies
<br>
a direct path to real AI and the Singularity.  Three nice things I can
<br>
legitimately say about Novamente, if it's completed along the lines
<br>
described in Ben's manuscript:
<br>
<p>1)  When complete, Novamente will probably be the most advanced realized AI
<br>
system on Earth.  IANAVC but it should have capabilities that other systems
<br>
don't, and Ben should be able to build something saleable out of it.
<br>
<p>2)  When complete, Novamente will exhibit capabilities that actually have
<br>
something to do with AI and aren't just algorithms wearing funny hats.
<br>
<p>3)  Novamente uses more than one idea, and the sum of the whole is greater
<br>
than the sum of the parts.
<br>
<p>Okay, now for the *rest* of the review... some of the things I have to say
<br>
about Novamente are pretty harsh; Ben is aware of this and may choose to
<br>
defend Novamente.  Any third parties who join the debate are asked to stick
<br>
to the nothing-personal rules of argument.
<br>
<p>My overall reaction is that Novamente is much, much simpler than I had been
<br>
visualizing from Ben's descriptions; the completed system would be nowhere
<br>
near general intelligence or seed AI, and Ben's expectation that either of
<br>
these things would be in Novamente's reach seems very alien to me.
<br>
<p>Capsule description of Novamente's architecture:  Novamente's core
<br>
representation is a semantic net, with nodes such as &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;fish&quot;, and
<br>
relations such as &quot;eats&quot;.  Some kind of emotional reaction is called for
<br>
here, lest others suspect me of secret sympathies for semantic networks: 
<br>
&quot;AAAARRRRGGGHHH!&quot;  Having gotten that over with, let's forge ahead.
<br>
<p>Novamente's core representation is not entirely that of a classical AI; Ben
<br>
insists that it be described as &quot;term logic&quot; rather than &quot;predicate logic&quot;,
<br>
meaning that it has quantitative truth values and quantitative attention
<br>
values (actually, Novamente can express more complex kinds of truth values
<br>
and attention values than simple quantities).  Similarly, Novamente's
<br>
logical inference processes are also quantitative; fuzzy logic rather than
<br>
theorem proving.  Novamente has complex behaviors that meet synergetically
<br>
in the common representation of the big semantic net, which is what raises
<br>
Novamente above one-idea AI; the major behaviors that stick out from my
<br>
perspective are (a) logical inference, (b) attention spreading, (c) mining
<br>
of generalizations, (d) evolutionary programming (mutation, recombination)
<br>
on term logic structures.
<br>
<p>However, from my perspective, Novamente has very *simple* behaviors for
<br>
inference, attention, generalization, and evolutionary programming.  For
<br>
example, Novamente notices spontaneous regularities by handing off the
<br>
problem to a generic data-mining algorithm on a separate server.  The
<br>
evolutionary programming is classical evolutionary programming.  The logical
<br>
inference has classical Bayesian semantics.  Attention spreads outward like
<br>
ripples in a pond.  Novamente does not have the complexity that would render
<br>
these problems tractable; the processes may intersect in a common
<br>
representation but the processes themselves are generic.  Regardless of
<br>
whether Novamente is Turing-complete, it looks to me like only a tiny corner
<br>
of the problem space is tractable for it.  &quot;Genericity is not generality&quot; is
<br>
the accusation I would level at most of AI.  Novamente is not completely
<br>
generic and this raises it far above the level of the current crowd of
<br>
proposed Real AI designs, but the sum of four generic processes is not
<br>
enough to achieve generality.
<br>
<p>Ben believes that Novamente will support another level of organization above
<br>
the current behaviors, so that inference/attention/mining/evolution of the
<br>
low level can support complex constructs on the high level.  While I
<br>
naturally agree that having more than one level of organization is a step
<br>
forward, the idea of trying to build a mind on top of low-level behaviors
<br>
originally constructed to imitate inference and attention is... well,
<br>
Novamente is already the most alien thing I've ever tried to wrap my mind
<br>
around; if Novamente's current behaviors can give rise to full cognition at
<br>
higher levels of organization, it would make Novamente a mind so absolutely
<br>
alien that it would make a human and a Friendly AI look like cousins.  But I
<br>
don't think Novamente can support general intelligence; I don't think that
<br>
the low-level behaviors implemented by Novamente (all of Novamente's current
<br>
behaviors are implemented at close to the token level) are ones that I don't
<br>
think can efficiently support high-level cognitive behaviors.  The lower
<br>
levels of Novamente were designed with the belief that these lower levels,
<br>
in themselves, implemented cognition, not with the intent that these low
<br>
levels should support higher levels of organization.  For example, Ben has
<br>
indicated that while he expects high-level inference on a separate level of
<br>
organization to emerge above the current low-level inferential behaviors, he
<br>
believes that it would be good to summarize the high-level patterns as
<br>
individual Novamente nodes so that the faster and more powerful low-level
<br>
inference mechanisms can operate on them directly.
<br>
<p>To see a genuine AI capability, you have to strip away the suggestive
<br>
English names and look at what behaviors the system supports even if nobody
<br>
is interpreting it.  When I look at Novamente through that lens, I see a
<br>
pattern-recognition system that may be capable of achieving limited goals
<br>
within the patterns it can recognize, although the goal system currently
<br>
described (and, as I understand, not yet implemented or tested) would permit
<br>
Novamente to achieve only a small fraction of the goals it should be capable
<br>
of representing.  Checking with Ben confirmed that all of the old Webmind
<br>
system's successes were in the domain of pattern recognition, so it doesn't
<br>
look like my intuitions are off.
<br>
<p>By the standards I would apply to real AI, Novamente is architecturally very
<br>
simple and is built around a relative handful of generic behaviors; I do not
<br>
believe that Novamente as it stands can support Ben's stated goals of
<br>
general intelligence, seed AI, or even the existence of substantial
<br>
intelligence on higher levels of organization.
