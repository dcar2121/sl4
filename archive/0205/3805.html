<em>&gt; Yes, Cyc operates from the assumption that meaning can be expressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as relationships among concepts, insofar as passing tests of understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- for example question answering.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is true *in principle* -- but that as a matter of practice, it
<br>
is much more efficient to represent meaning in terms of relations among
<br>
*concepts plus remembered percepts and actions*.
<br>
<p>The key difference between concepts and percepts/actions, as I intend it in
<br>
this context, is that percepts and actions are only VERY AWKWARDLY AND
<br>
INEFFICIENTLY expressible in terms of logical propositions, and are much
<br>
more naturally expressed in terms like huge arrays of numbers (percepts) or
<br>
complex executable programs (actions).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I suppose that given a sufficient model (or lots of instances) of what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call perceptual patterns, I would try to determine a vocabulary to assert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationships among the objects in the perception. Fuzzy terms could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to collapse the (overly precise) features from visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions.  So if the system were shown enough pictures of Apples,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the assertions might of the form: &quot;Apples are approximately red in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; color&quot; &quot;Apples are about 5 cm in diameter&quot;.  Given a KB containing such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions, and a vision system extracting those features, I believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cyc could classify a new picture as an Apple picture or not.
</em><br>
<p>yes, but I would assert that if you have as set of remembered perceptions
<br>
and actions of size N, the space cost of representing this set thoroughly as
<br>
a collection of conceptual propositions is going to be superexponential in
<br>
N.
<br>
<p>By keeping an array of numerical data as a record of a perceived scene, one
<br>
is keeping a &quot;compressed version&quot; of the huge number of propositions that
<br>
are patterns in this data.
<br>
<p>Of course, one can trivially represent a table of perceived data in terms of
<br>
propositions like
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Element at row i, column j of table T is 555.4444&quot;
<br>
<p>but this isn't really conceptual in the ordinary sense, it's just a mapping
<br>
of percepts into conceptual language.
<br>
<p>In Novamente we keep percepts and actions in two forms
<br>
<p>Percepts are kept in a special repository of number tables, and actions are
<br>
kept in a special format called &quot;compound schema.&quot;
<br>
<p>But these number tables can then be extracted into propositional form, and
<br>
these compound schema can be expanded into distributed schema that are fully
<br>
inference-friendly
<br>
<p>I feel this kind of dual representation is necessary for pragmatic purposes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as question answering is concerned, I would say there are many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases in which Cyc's understanding of the concepts denoted by English
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words is testable.  For example &quot;World War II&quot; denotes the term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c0fd5d2b-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270 which has the name WorldWarII. Cyc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows (has the assertion): The Nuremberg Trials starts after the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of World War II. In CycL: (startsAfterEndingOf NurembergTrials WorldWarII)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cyc could be asked (in the CycL equivalent to) &quot;Did the Nurenburg Trials
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur before World War II?&quot; and respond &quot;No&quot; and give the justification.
</em><br>
<p>Drawing shallow deductive conclusions from book-learning, in this manner, is
<br>
definitely going to be relatively easy for Cyc.  But drawing
<br>
useful/meaningful analogies between significantly different situations that
<br>
it &quot;knows&quot; about is going to be hard for it.  Because analogy is driven by
<br>
the creation of new concepts and by abstract contextual control patterns,
<br>
both of which are derived from analysis of large masses of perceptual and
<br>
action data that are not conveniently representable in propositional form.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If I had to pick an incremental direction for Cyc (as opposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a complete philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revision), I think it would be focusing on those Cyc concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; grounded in the complex data of Cyc's internals - i.e., teaching Cyc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perceptual concepts for its own internals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed, as that is a path to Seed AI.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree very strongly with this intuition.
<br>
<p>I think it would be a lot better for the Cyc project to focus on some
<br>
particular perception-action domain that is richer and simpler than Cyc's
<br>
codebase.
<br>
<p>For instance, the military does vast amounts of work on computer vision and
<br>
associated robotic action.  If I were directing the Cyc project, I would try
<br>
to use Cyc in the highest level of a hierarchical-architecture vision
<br>
processing / robotic control system.  This would be a very nice way to get
<br>
Cyc started grounding some of its concepts in reality.  for instance, its
<br>
concept of &quot;tree&quot; would be grounded in the visual patterns seen by a camera
<br>
eye when it looks like a tree. Its concept of &quot;fast&quot; would be grounded in
<br>
what happened when its robot body was moving fast.
<br>
<p>For intance, interfacing Cyc with James R. Albus's (NIST) work using
<br>
intelligent hierarchically/heterarchically-structured control systems to
<br>
guide experimental tanks would be extremely interesting.  Look up Albus's
<br>
work if you're not familiar with it, it is truly awesome.  If you don't know
<br>
him and are potentially interested in this connection, let me know; I know
<br>
Albus, though we're not extremely close.
<br>
<p>Personally I don't like the idea of military funding for AI, but since
<br>
you're already living off military funding, collaborating with someone like
<br>
Albus doing sensory processing for the military couldn't hurt.
<br>
<p>I mention Albus because I think he has a VERY VERY GOOD architecture for the
<br>
perception/action levels of the mind, applied practically in an extremely
<br>
effective way.  (The video of his automatically-controlled tank cruising
<br>
around is pretty nifty, I'm not sure if it's online or not, I saw it as a
<br>
conference recently.)
<br>
<p>Of course, Cyc and Albus's architecture don't glue together all that
<br>
naturally.  To connect them directly would require some real hacking.
<br>
Novamente with its more flexible architecture of course could provide a kind
<br>
of &quot;glue&quot; here.  Using Albus's stuff, Cyc, and Novamente, we could make a
<br>
really awesome intelligent tank that would be incomparably efficient at
<br>
mowing down third world citizens without endangering precious US lives.  Now
<br>
there's a truly inspiring thought, huh?? ;-p
<br>
<p>My intuition is that cyc's reasoning engine will prove badly inadequate for
<br>
dealing with concepts that are grounded in perceptual and motor data such as
<br>
that which comes through a tank....  One will need a much more robust
<br>
reasoning system like... umm, Novamente's ;-&gt;
