But, mind-building also benefits from the technological exponential
<br>
advancement, obviously.
<br>
<p>A more solid, point, I think, is that the rate of progress of
<br>
human-brain-emulation is *easier to predict*.  This is the main reason
<br>
Kurzweil harps on it so much.  It's pretty obvious that as brain scanning
<br>
and computer hardware both advance, it will eventually become possible to
<br>
create a digital simulacrum of a human brain.  Most people probably don't
<br>
accept this, but most people with an open-minded futurist mental framework,
<br>
certainly.
<br>
<p>The rate of progress of mind-building not guided by detailed human-brain
<br>
emulation, on the other hand, is really hard to predict.  There are no
<br>
pretty curves to plot: either an amazing breakthrough will happen or it
<br>
won't.   You surmise that it won't, which is your right, but it's just your
<br>
intuition.  The fact that brain-building will benefit from technological
<br>
advancement proves nothing, as mind-building obviously will too.

<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The race between those building an AI by reverse engineering the human
<br>
brain physically and those reverse engineering the human mind functionally
<br>
will be won by the brain builders.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sorry to say this.  I wish it wasn't so.  I think the implications
<br>
for friendliness are not good.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason the brain builders will win is simple.    What they are doing
<br>
is completely mechanical and will therefore benefit from technological
<br>
exponential advancement.  Look at the Human Genome Project as an example.
<br>
The project started in 1988.  By 1995 5 million base pairs had been
<br>
sequenced.  1998 100 million base pairs.  June 1999 1 billion bp.  June 2000
<br>
2.91Bbp.  Over half of the base pairs were sequenced during the 9 months
<br>
prior to June 2000.  And actually Celera completed it in 6 months by
<br>
February but agreed to delay until the joint announcement in June so as not
<br>
to embarrass the official project.  Everyone was surprised by the
<br>
exponential growth curve of base pairs sequenced by time.  We shouldn't be
<br>
surprised when the same thing happens with the brain builders.  What Ben
<br>
Goertzel, Peter Voss, Eliezer Yudkowsky, and others are doing is at the
<br>
opposite end of the scale from mechanical, and will advance relatively
<br>
linearly until completion of the working prototype, too late.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike.
