<p>
Hello all,
<br>
<p>I have posted two essays online, and will be curious for feedback from
<br>
interested members of this community.
<br>
<p>Some leisure reading for the masochists in the audience... ;-&gt;
<br>
<p><p>1)  &quot;Thoughts on AI Morality.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2002/AIMorality.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2002/AIMorality.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Last night I finally got the urge to write my long-nurtured riposte to
<br>
Eliezer's CFAI document.  It is not nearly as long as CFAI, and I don't
<br>
think I will write a long document on the topic any time soon, as one of my
<br>
thoughts on the topic is that it is too early in the development of AGI to
<br>
say very much about it.
<br>
<p>However, I think I did an OK job in this document of explaining why I
<br>
intuitively feel the &quot;Friendly AI goal system&quot; Eliezer has proposed is
<br>
unlikely to work.
<br>
<p>Of course, I do not claim to have *proved* his approach will not work.  I
<br>
don't think we have the tools to prove anything significant about AGI goal
<br>
systems or morality at this point.  All I have done is to present my
<br>
intuition and give the reasons for it, which are deeply tied to my own
<br>
theory of mind.
<br>
<p>Although I use some Novamente examples in this essay, the main points in the
<br>
essay are not specifically related to Novamente, but have to do with my
<br>
thoughts about the general nature of mind and AGI.
<br>
<p>This essay is totally nontechnical.
<br>
<p><p>2)  &quot;Hebbian Logic:The Emergence of Symbolic Reasoning in Formal Neural
<br>
Networks via Cell Assemblies and a Logic-Friendly Variant of Hebbian
<br>
Learning.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2002/HebbianLogic.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2002/HebbianLogic.htm</a>
<br>
<p>This presents an *avowedly speculative* theory of how advanced cognition
<br>
*may* emerge from neurodynamics.
<br>
<p>I sent Eliezer and Peter and a few others a copy of this a month or two ago.
<br>
<p>Unlike what Eliezer said in a recent post, however, Hebbian Logic is *not* a
<br>
theory of how small neural nets can give rise to emergent logical inference
<br>
in an efficient way.  Rather, it is a theory of how *very large* neural nets
<br>
can give rise to emergent logical inference in a *very inefficient* way.
<br>
<p>This one is a bit technical.  It proposes some specific neural net learning
<br>
rules, variants of the standard Hebb rule, and makes some fairly hand-wavy
<br>
arguments that these learning rules seem likely to be able to give rise to
<br>
emergent behavior following the rules of probabilistic logic.
<br>
<p>I don't think I've &quot;cracked the nut of how the brain works&quot; here or anything
<br>
like that.  My objective was a lot less lofty: just to convince myself that
<br>
the gap between neurodynamics and logic is not as large as most people
<br>
think.  It seems possible and not that tough to build a conceptual bridge
<br>
between the two levels.
<br>
<p>This is definitively not a Novamente article (for that see
<br>
www.realai.net/article.htm).  Novamente is not founded on Hebbian Logic.
<br>
One could seek to create a real AI based on Hebbian Logic; my intuition is
<br>
that this would lead to a vastly less efficient system than Novamente.
<br>
Hebbian Logic is a little closer conceptual to Peter Voss's approach than to
<br>
Novamente, though it is very different from Peter's approach in detail.
<br>
<p>Conceptually, however, the ideas in this article emanate from the same
<br>
*philosophy* as Novamente does.  Part of this philosophy is that the
<br>
distinction between logic-based AI and NN-based AI is largely bogus.
<br>
Semantics nets and neural nets, in my view, are not as different as they're
<br>
made out to be.  Novamente embodies this philosophy by using a hybrid
<br>
semantic/neural network architecture.  Hebbian Logic embodies it by making
<br>
hypotheses about how the human mind's semantic nets emerge from the human
<br>
brain's neural nets.
<br>
<p><p><p>Yours,
<br>
Ben G
