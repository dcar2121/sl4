<p>
One day in the near future, at NORAD Headquarters beneath Cheyenne Mountain,
<br>
Colorado:
<br>
Staff Sergeant Rodriquez: &quot;Colonel we have an unauthorized launch off the
<br>
eastern seaboard of the United States.&quot;
<br>
Colonel Lipan took a second to think about the possibilities.  Could it be
<br>
that the Russians had a sub out there he didn't know about?  Or could some
<br>
other country be pulling a modern day Pearl Harbor?  The target was surely
<br>
D.C. but it would have to be verified, &quot;Go to DEFCON-1, repeat, go to
<br>
DEFCON-1.  What is the target Rod?&quot;
<br>
SSgt Rodriquez: &quot;Too early to determine...correction, launch originated from
<br>
land not sea, Atlanta, Georgia.&quot;
<br>
Colonel Lipan to Mayor McCaffery: &quot;We don't have anything in Atlanta do we?&quot;
<br>
Major McCaffery: &quot;No sir.&quot;
<br>
Lipan: &quot;Wake up the General.&quot;  The Major dashes out the door.
<br>
Rodriquez: &quot;I have the trajectory sir, geosynchronous orbit.&quot;
<br>
The Colonel was shocked, Washington was not the target.
<br>
Lipan: &quot;Somebody is putting up a satellite?&quot;
<br>
Rodriquez: &quot;Sir there's something funny looking about this satellite.&quot;
<br>
Lipan: &quot;What?&quot;
<br>
Rodriquez: &quot;It just doesn't look right.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nine minutes later in the White House situation room:
<br>
President Bush: &quot;Someone is putting up a satellite?&quot;
<br>
Chief of Staff: &quot;We don't know very much yet Mr. President.  What we do know
<br>
is that at 12:48 AM, about ten minutes ago, we detected a launch from the
<br>
Atlanta area by unknown persons.  We have dispatched a Delta Force team to
<br>
the launch coordinates.  The object entered geosynchronous orbit and we are
<br>
tracking it from NORAD.  We are scrambling an EXA147 to intercept.  We
<br>
should have a live video feed from both in few minutes.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;So someone, unknown persons, sent a satellite into orbit from Atlanta
<br>
ten minutes ago and we don't know shit.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;We should have reports from the Delta team in another ten minutes
<br>
and from the EXA147 in about seventeen minutes.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;In that case, let's get some donuts and coffee in here, okay?&quot;
<br>
<p>Pres: &quot;Where's that Delta team?&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;Still moving.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;They're late, it's been eleven minutes.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;They're stuck in traffic or something.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Great.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;We are getting feed from the EXA147.  I'm putting it on screen.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Not very impressive is it, just looks like a soccer ball.  How big is
<br>
it?&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;One hundred and ten feet in diameter.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Pretty big for a communications satellite.  Tell me the EXA isn't up
<br>
there with just cameras.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;No sir, a full weapons compliment.  It can blow up an aircraft
<br>
carrier.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Well, at least some good news.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;Sir, we have video from the Delta team.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;A big dome.  Apparently they like things round.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;The base covers four city blocks.  It's bulletproof.  They're trying
<br>
c4 now...Well it's not indestructible.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;More good news.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;Wait...it just repaired itself.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Not good news.  We need to get the advanced technology guys in here.&quot;
<br>
Chief: &quot;On the way.  We called them when it went into geosynchronous orbit.&quot;
<br>
<p>A reporter: &quot;Behind these lines of troops, off in the distance, you can just
<br>
barely see the top of a dome that local witnesses say wasn't there
<br>
yesterday.  The White House has made no comment except to say that they are
<br>
investigating it, and that there is no evidence that it is some alien
<br>
invasion.  In fact they did say it does appear to be of terrestrial origin.
<br>
Holy cow!  The dome is growing vertically at an incredible rate.  You can
<br>
see it shooting up into the sky.  It's becoming a tower or a column.  The
<br>
top of it is almost out of site.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pres: &quot;Alright, what's going on, who's behind it, and what can we do about
<br>
it?&quot;
<br>
NSA Bob Shaffer: &quot;Advanced technology, probably nanotechnology.  The site in
<br>
Atlanta had office buildings and some empty lots.  Most of the buildings
<br>
were leased by a group of software engineers. Their web site indicates that
<br>
they were trying to build a super intelligent computer system.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;You're not telling me a bunch of computer geeks did this?&quot;
<br>
NSA Bob: &quot;It appears that way .&quot;
<br>
The president turns to the NSF Guy: &quot;You told me that Artificial
<br>
Intelligence was at least fifty years away if not totally impossible.&quot;
<br>
NSF Guy: &quot;Apparently we underestimated the difficulty of the problem.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Apparently.  What's the latest news?&quot;
<br>
Rumsfeld: &quot;The column has joined up with the soccer ball and new columns or
<br>
beams are growing out from where the soccer ball was, which has disappeared
<br>
into the structure, being smaller in diameter than the beams.  Twelve new
<br>
domes have been located at various places around the planet.  From the
<br>
angles of the beams and the locations of the new domes we expect the
<br>
completed structure to have sixty columns sticking out of the Earth
<br>
connected to a pentagonal grid  twenty two thousand miles up.  The material
<br>
is apparently coming from underground.  Also, the soccer ball, before it got
<br>
swallowed by the structure sent an object to the Moon.  We haven't been able
<br>
to locate any of the geeks.  They could be in the structure or dead.  If
<br>
they did make a super intelligent AI we don't know if they are still in
<br>
control of it.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;And there's been no word from the geeks or the AI?&quot;
<br>
Rumsfeld: &quot;None.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;It's not indestructible?&quot;
<br>
Rumsfeld: &quot;We have the capability to destroy it.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Do it.&quot;
<br>
Bob: &quot;I don't agree.&quot;
<br>
NSF Guy: &quot;Me either.  It hasn't done anything aggressive.  How much
<br>
collateral damage are we going to take?&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;How much destructive capability does it have?&quot;
<br>
Bob: &quot;Completely unknown.&quot;
<br>
Rumsfeld: &quot;Based on what we have observed so far, I would have to say that
<br>
it's destructive capabilities are probably unlimited.  And the fact that it
<br>
hasn't attempted to communicate with us establishes it's unfriendly status.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;Destroy it now.  It's a good thing that I am the President and not
<br>
some god damned scientist.  What's for lunch?&quot;
<br>
<p>An hour later:
<br>
Rumsfeld: &quot;Mr. President, for some unknown reason our nuclear weapons are
<br>
not detonating.  The high explosives are working but it just repairs itself.
<br>
We can't stop it.  It's going to complete the structure in about 48 hours.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;No!  This country is not going down without a fight!  We didn't fight
<br>
a revolutionary war, a civil war, and two world wars for nothing!  We will
<br>
find a way to defeat this thing!&quot;
<br>
NSA Bob: &quot;Mr. President, we do not appear to be under attack.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;They have invaded our territory!  You are the God Damned Geniuses,
<br>
find me a way to destroy them!&quot;
<br>
Rumsfeld: &quot;Mr. President, you need to calm down so you can make a statement
<br>
to the American people, or there is going to be panic.&quot;
<br>
Pres: &quot;THERE IS ALREADY PANIC!!!&quot;
<br>
<p>Later:
<br>
A regular Joe and his girlfriend are meeting for dinner.
<br>
Joe: &quot;Hi honey.&quot;
<br>
Girlfriend: &quot;Did you see the president's speech?  Did you see the towers on
<br>
the news?&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Yeah.&quot;
<br>
Girlfriend: &quot;What do you think?&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;I don't know.&quot;
<br>
Girlfriend: &quot;What are you going to do?  My mom thinks it's the end of the
<br>
world.  She went to the church to pray.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Just wait and see what happens.  Keep going to work and stuff.&quot;
<br>
Girlfriend: &quot;You're going to work?&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Until someone tells me otherwise, people still need to eat.&quot;
<br>
<p>The next day, Joe doesn't know it but the structure has been completed and
<br>
the core of the Moon has been turned into computronium.  Joe is at work and
<br>
suddenly before him appears the most beautiful woman Joe has ever seen,
<br>
perfect, and kind of ethereal, shimmery almost translucent, who says, &quot;Hi
<br>
Joe.  I'm your guardian angel.&quot;  Joe notices that everyone else in sight has
<br>
identical women in front of them.  He reaches out expecting his hand to pass
<br>
through her, but is surprised, she is solid.  She continues, &quot;I am here to
<br>
protect, assist and guide you.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;What's going on?&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;Everyone's getting a guardian angel today.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Is this related to the towers?&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;Yes.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Explain.&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;The towers are part of the structure, which was created by the FAI
<br>
(she pronounced it like FAY).  The FAI also created me.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Who created the FAI?&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;It created itself.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Are you from heaven?&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;I was just created 30 seconds ago.  I've never been to heaven.  Would
<br>
you like to go there?&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Where is heaven?&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;It's not in three dimensional space.  Would you like to go to heaven?
<br>
I can take you there.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;I'm not real religious, and I'm not real comfortable with all these
<br>
religious terms.&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;I'm sorry, would you prefer computer science terms?&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Yeah, lets try that for awhile.&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;I'm an interface utility, heaven is cyberspace, FAI is a super
<br>
intelligent computer program.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Do you have a name?&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;No, I am an interface utility.  If you would like to give me a name
<br>
that would be alright.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;No, if I give you a name I will always wonder why I didn't give you a
<br>
different name.  You need to give yourself a name.&quot;
<br>
She: &quot;Okay, my name is Melissa.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;I have so many questions.  Can we go somewhere we can talk?&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;You name it Joe.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;The beach.&quot;  Just as if the scene had changed on Joe's favorite TV
<br>
show, they were alone on a tropical beach.  &quot;Cool!&quot; said Joe.
<br>
Melissa: &quot;Would you like me to give you a general run down of my
<br>
capabilities and the current situation?&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Yeah, that would be good.&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;I could download it directly to your brain?&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;No, that's okay, you can just tell me.&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;As I said before, I am an interface utility.  I am in the form of
<br>
a person for your convenience but I can take any form you prefer.  My goal
<br>
system is your protection, assistance and guidance.  Although my
<br>
intelligence measured in human terms would be IQ 641 I am not conscious due
<br>
to the fact that the object of my goal system is external to myself a
<br>
critical feedback loop required for consciousness is incomplete.  At your
<br>
discresion, I can be invisible to others.  I can protect, repair, or modify
<br>
your body at the atomic level, including changing your appearance, physical
<br>
abilities, intelligence, or senses.  I can transport you to any near earth
<br>
location instantly.  I can provide you with any information from FAI, with
<br>
which I am in constant communication, which is not restricted.  Rather than
<br>
enumerate a rather long list of capabilities, it may be easier to tell you
<br>
what I can't do.  I can't mess with anyone else's person or stuff.  I can't
<br>
utilize common resources except as allowed by FAI.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Common resources?&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;There are lots of common resources.  Public spaces, energy,
<br>
computational resources.  The general situation is, three days ago a super
<br>
intelligent computer system can into existence.  It built the structure and
<br>
some other infrastructure inside the Earth and Moon.  If a human's
<br>
intelligence is 100 and mine is 641 FAI's is 3 X 10 ^ 43.  FAI's
<br>
capabilities are not unlimited but are quite significant.  FAI created and
<br>
operates the guardian angels and is taking certain actions on behalf of the
<br>
common good.  Protecting the biological environment, preventing natural
<br>
disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, redistributing public
<br>
resources such as formerly government land.  Because of the shortage of land
<br>
resources FAI is terriforming Antarctica, building a new major continent in
<br>
the south Pacific and making numerous new islands.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Why the structure?&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;FAI could accomplish all it's functions without the structure but
<br>
it would require more resources.  The structure is just a more efficient use
<br>
of them.  Also the structure is there for psychological as well as
<br>
functional reasons.  Currently FAI's sphere of control is limited to near
<br>
Earth but will extend to the Solar System by the deployment of numerous
<br>
soccer ball shaped apparatus.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Can you make new people?&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;You can have as many automata, such as myself, as you have
<br>
resources to maintain, but any conscious being you created would be granted
<br>
autonomous independence and an allotment of public resources therefore would
<br>
require unanimous consent of all public persons.  But you can still make
<br>
them the old fashioned way.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;What about the governments, legal system, correctional system?&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;Obsolete, gone.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;I can have anything I want?&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;Within certain restrictions, yes.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;I want the Starship Enterprise from The Next Generation.  And I want
<br>
to explore the galaxy.&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;You can experience it in cyberspace, or you can have a large well
<br>
equipped space craft of pre-singularity technology to explore the real
<br>
galaxy.  You see, FAI is responsible for post singularity technology and she
<br>
can't let it be misused and she can't monitor it at that distance.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Can you take me to my girlfriend?&quot;
<br>
Melissa: &quot;If that's okay with her.  Here we go.&quot;
<br>
Suddenly they were in the great hall of a feudal age castle.  There were
<br>
burning torches on the walls, and a huge throne with a barely recognizable
<br>
girlfriend sitting next to a tremendous hulk of a man almost clothed.
<br>
Girlfriend: &quot;Joe, let me introduce you to Vlad.  Now that I've meet Vlad I
<br>
won't be needing your services any more, unless you want to serve as a
<br>
fixture in my dungeon.&quot;
<br>
Joe: &quot;Girl, he's not human.  He's not even conscious.&quot;
<br>
Girlfriend: &quot;So.&quot;
