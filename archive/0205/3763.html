Welcome to SL4, Stephen.
<br>
<p>I've been quite impressed with Cycorp, and Doug Lenat's continuous efforts.
<br>
In 1998 I (naively) requesting a copy of Cyc... and was even willing to pay
<br>
for it :)  I received a quick response that was helpful, and informative...
<br>
but a little out of my price-range :/  The move to publish significant
<br>
portions of Cyc into the public domain is a much appreciated (by me at
<br>
least).  I believe that the Cyc knowledge base will be very helpful in
<br>
providing high-quality contextual input to an AI that is trying to learn
<br>
about the world.  In conjunction with learning via vis own sensory
<br>
modalities, the Cyc input will provide an additional viewpoint, and extra
<br>
level of clarification, that I think is likely to speed-up the learning
<br>
process significantly.  Also, it may help with understanding the *output*
<br>
from an AI.  If ve can 'explain' a new idea by creating a set of related
<br>
data in Cyc, it will give *us* an additional way of understanding ver.  Of
<br>
course Natural Language would be good too, but, as recently demonstrated by
<br>
Ben Goertzel (brief paper about definition of complexity), the presentation
<br>
of mathematical equations and logical constructs can greatly enhance the
<br>
precision of communication.
<br>
<p>In reference to: &quot;We are working hard to create a real AI.&quot;... any
<br>
additional information and/or detail that you can provide would be very
<br>
welcome here.  The interplay of ideas, the discussion of problems and
<br>
solutions, will help us all to improve our designs.
