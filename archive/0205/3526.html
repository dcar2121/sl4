<em>&gt; At the recent Foresight Senior Associates gathering (April 26-28, 2002,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hotel Crowne Plaza Cabana, Palo Alto) , the Singularity was featured in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several presentations (although not mentioned in the website program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preview: <a href="http://www.foresight.org/SrAssoc/spring2002/program.html">http://www.foresight.org/SrAssoc/spring2002/program.html</a> ).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Foresight noted: `For the first time, this meeting is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;off-the-record.&quot;' I know Eliezer and John Smart spoke; perhaps others in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SL4 forum also attended. As a distant but interested Australian, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; welcome any news reports of this potentially important occasion.

<p><p>Hi,
<br>
<p>I was there, as a representative of the Frankfurter Allgemaine Zeitung, a
<br>
German paper that I write for sometimes.
<br>
<p>Frankly, there wasn't much said on the formal program there that would be
<br>
novel in any way to folks on this list.  I think that the Foresight Senior
<br>
Associates Gathering exists mainly to bring Silicon Valley investors and
<br>
businessfolk up to speed on radical techno-futurist thinking.  There are no
<br>
highly technical presentations; it's more a matter of techies and policy
<br>
wonks bringing the investment/business audience up to speed on recent
<br>
developments and ideas.
<br>
<p>That's not to say there weren't plenty of interesting conversations &quot;off the
<br>
program&quot; though.
<br>
<p>For instance, I saw a demo of Peter Voss's Artificial-General-Intelligence
<br>
in the making, a highly sophisticated, vaguely neural-nettish program that
<br>
is learning to recognize patterns in visual scenes and other things, and to
<br>
carry out actions coordinated with its perceptions etc.  Still in the early
<br>
stages of development, but definitely interesting &amp; impressive.
<br>
(Of course, Eliezer, Peter and I each have our skepticism about the others'
<br>
approaches to AI; but even though Peter's approach is not my chosen
<br>
approach, I still think it makes good sense and has a nonzero chance of
<br>
success at the grand goal.  I think there are *many* routes to real AI,
<br>
although I do think my route is the best one I've seen so far ... and I know
<br>
Peter thinks the same about his ;)
<br>
<p>And Steve Jurvetson (the VC from DFJ), as well as walking around with a
<br>
silly-looking blinkie in his ear, was pursuing a long conversation with
<br>
Eliezer and others on the question of whether evolution *necessarily* leads
<br>
to selfish creatures, or whether it would be pragmatically possible to
<br>
evolve creatures with compassion as the fitness function.
<br>
<p>There was one presentation that touched on notions of Friendly AI, but
<br>
didn't directly refer to Eliezer's work, and in my view presented a somewhat
<br>
simplistic perspective.  It was proposed that &quot;greater intelligence
<br>
automatically leads to greater morality because it allows beings to better
<br>
see the consequences of their actions.&quot;  I'd *like* to believe this was true
<br>
in some sort of statistical way, in spite of numerous obvious anecdotal
<br>
counterexamples, but no convincing argument was presented.  This
<br>
presentation was a little disappointing in that one would at least have
<br>
liked it to REFER to Eliezer's presentation from last year, so as to give
<br>
the feeling of incremental progress from year to year.  But I suppose that
<br>
philosophy rarely gives the same feeling of ongoing progress in the way that
<br>
science and engineering do.
<br>
<p>Ray Kurzweil gave a nice &quot;special interest group&quot; on the Singularity.  He
<br>
made pretty clear, in response to some pointed questions by Peter Voss after
<br>
the formal meeting was done, that he believes the &quot;imitate the human brain
<br>
closely&quot; approach is by far the most likely path to artificial general
<br>
intelligence.  I think this is close to the view of Eugene Leitl, on this
<br>
list, and others as well I presume.  After enough repeated exposures I have
<br>
to say I get a little weary of Kurzweil's graphs of the impending
<br>
Singularity -- but even so, I'm glad he's out there tirelessly making the
<br>
point, which the vast majority of the educated human race still refuses to
<br>
get.
<br>
<p>On the more practical side, Barry Bunin demonstrated some really cool
<br>
biochemical database software being made at his company Libraria.  This kind
<br>
of work -- providing databases of knowledge spanning multiple areas of
<br>
science -- is paving the way for massive scientific progress in a kind of
<br>
low-key way.  'Cause it's these databases that near-future AI's will study
<br>
to figure out how to improve humanity genomically...
<br>
<p>A change from last year is that this year there were a few venture
<br>
capitalists *eager* to talk to entrepreneurs.  Last year on the other hand,
<br>
the investor community seemed to be in a totally quiescent phase.  Now it
<br>
seems almost half-awake ;-p
<br>
<p>Etc.  There was plenty more, this was just a quasi-random sampling...
<br>
