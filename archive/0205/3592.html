</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That there are many different incompatible systems of philosophy does not
<br>
imply that all, or even any, of those philosophies are self-consistent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's an interesting question.  I would expect/hope resource conflicts

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree. There are 6 billion minds on Earth and presumably there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be at least that many post-Singularity. All it would take for resource
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicts to occur is for one mind to want use all matter in the solar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system to build a giant optical telescope, and another one to use all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter to simulate an alternate universe. Why would you expect that 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billion different sets of supergoals can all be achieved without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant resource conflicts?
</em><br>
<p>Operative word: &quot;Significant&quot;.  Does it really matter who gets to keep the
<br>
original model of R2D2 from Star Wars?
<br>
<p>But of course this is a highly optimistic view; on the other hand, mana plus
<br>
Minimum Living Space seems like a straightforward way of settling any
<br>
conflict, not just insignificant ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; One take is that after the Singularity all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentient beings would get a quantity of &quot;mana&quot; and that mana could be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to bid on whichever universal resources are conserved, after which all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conserved resources would be private property.  But that's just a guess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess that means you don't subscribe to communism, which says private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property is bad, or democracy, which says that as long as a majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrees, a tax can be imposed on everyone's property to serve some common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose.  So do you believe that private property is good in itself, or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it good because it leads to good consequences?
</em><br>
<p>I believe that private property is a correct answer in this case because it
<br>
seems to be the bedrock for determining whether a solution like communism or
<br>
democracy is fair.  Suppose that I believe in private property, you believe
<br>
in democracy, and Damien Broderick believes in communism.  Assuming we're
<br>
all still that human at this point, there's no reason why you and 2 billion
<br>
people can't choose to live in a democracy, while Broderick and 2 billion
<br>
others choose to live in a communism, and I and 2 billion others choose to
<br>
live in a private-property system.  It seems simpler for conserved resources
<br>
go 1/3 to each of the three systems than that nobody gets any conserved
<br>
resources (the communist solution; incidentally, how the heck does anyone
<br>
ever make use of anything under post-Singularity communism?) or that the
<br>
disposition of the conserved resources would be decided by majority vote. 
<br>
Of course, this just drops the question back a level and asks what criteria
<br>
determine &quot;simpler&quot;.  I would say that private property is the solution that
<br>
resonates most strongly with the Friendliness principles of &quot;If a question
<br>
is arbitrary, let people pick their own answers&quot; and &quot;A symmetrical solution
<br>
is better than an asymmetrical one; at the acausal level, symmetry is
<br>
mandatory&quot;.  It's possible to view communism and democracy as voluntary
<br>
special cases of this rule.  If you can figure out a good way to ground
<br>
communism and democracy symmetrically on the acausal level, you might be
<br>
able to make a case that they are more basic, or more consistent with other
<br>
moral principles, than the private-property/volition model.
<br>
<p>Actually, things are much more complicated than this, but sending off a
<br>
partial explanation is probably better than waiting to try and write it up
<br>
completely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't you think it would be a good idea, before porting your philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into an AI, to examine your philosophy in detail and make sure that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really what you want to port?
</em><br>
<p>Why, yes, what a good idea.  No offense, Wei Dai, and I'm speaking strictly
<br>
in my personal capacity as just one more poster on SL4, but gimme a break! 
<br>
If it took until now for that thought to filter into my head, I should have
<br>
been locked up as a menace to the human species in 1998.
