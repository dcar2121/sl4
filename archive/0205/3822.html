hi,
<br>
<p><p>***
<br>
5. Although Albus design comes out of the Robotic/Numerical Control field,
<br>
I agree that his architecture is generally applicable.  The RCS library
<br>
seems tailored to numerical control so I would not be immediately
<br>
interested in an interface whose purpose was to make Cyc more
<br>
intelligent. Rather, I would enhance Cyc along the lines of the Albus
<br>
Reference Model Architecture, and at the lowest hierarchical levels,
<br>
explore and use the world of external knowledge sources.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>I can see you could make a Cyc-ish implementation of the Reference Model 
<br>
Architecture...
<br>
<p>Ultimately though, you've got to deal with the problem of mapping big 
<br>
numerical data tables (coming in from sensors) and numerical control 
<br>
parameters (going out to actuators) into Cyc propositions, in a way that is 
<br>
useful in real-time....
<br>
<p>I suspect that, in dealing with this problem within Cyc, Novamente or 
<br>
anything else, plenty of aspects of the RCS library will be very useful 
<br>
guidance, *in addition to* the overall RMA design
<br>
<p><p>***
<br>
6. The most encouraging aspect of what I read, is that Albus' architecture
<br>
has been proven on manufacturing cells and self-guided vehicles.  If I
<br>
dream that someday Cyc will be the intellect of robots, then it must at
<br>
the minimum be able to perform as well as RCS, or be able to program an
<br>
RCS configuration.
<br>
***
<br>
<p>Yes, but this is obviously a weak ambition!
<br>
<p>RCS works a lot worse than humans so far, and (as you know) a lot of what 
<br>
is needed to make it better than it is, is incorporation of inference on 
<br>
relatively abstract declarative knowledge -- knowledge learned from 
<br>
experience, and knowledge transferred from humans.
<br>
<p>I think that integrating RCS-type knowledge with Cyc-type knowledge is a 
<br>
very deep and hard problem... and of course I think that Novamente's 
<br>
knowledge representation constitutes *one among many possible paths* to 
<br>
solving it....
<br>
