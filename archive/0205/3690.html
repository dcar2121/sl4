<p>
Baron Hans Nidrach von Pompzidaize sat in his laboratory, looking at
<br>
experimental test subject X17.  &quot;How do you feel?&quot; he inquired, his
<br>
rolling bass echoing from the laboratory walls.
<br>
<p>&quot;Superintelligent, Doc,&quot; replied X17, who had once been known as John
<br>
Smith.  &quot;I've only had the Super-Neural Bypass for sixteen seconds, and
<br>
already I've learned twenty-seven languages and figured out how to play the
<br>
piano.&quot;
<br>
<p>Baron von Pompzidaize frowned, examining several multicolored readouts.  &quot;It
<br>
should be twenty-seven point three.  Well, then, do you now feel competent
<br>
to go destroy the Consortium of Evil and its dread leader, Admiral Floomp? 
<br>
Acting in accordance with the 1930s North-American conception of gentlemanly
<br>
behavior, of course.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Sure, Doc,&quot; said X17.  &quot;It's not like I've got anything better to do.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Excellent,&quot; said the Baron, checking two gauges and a flashing display.
<br>
&quot;You still have the emotional maturity of a flatworm, like everyone
<br>
else in this novel.  I was afraid your superhuman abilities might give
<br>
you an outlook slightly at variance with mine.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;==
<br>
<p>Baron Hans Nidrach von Pompzidaize sat in his laboratory, looking at
<br>
experimental test subject X17.  &quot;How do you feel?&quot; he inquired, his
<br>
rolling bass echoing from the laboratory walls.
<br>
<p>&quot;Strange,&quot; said X17 softly.  &quot;Very strange, as if...&quot;  He stared off
<br>
into space for a moment.  &quot;I think I've been stupid.&quot;
<br>
<p>Baron von Pompzidaize frowned, examining several multicolored readouts. 
<br>
&quot;You should have learned twenty-seven point three languages by now.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;How can anyone learn three-tenths of a language?  And how would I learn
<br>
a language without hearing it?&quot; X17 said in a peculiarly flat voice.
<br>
<p>Baron von Pompzidaize stared.  &quot;You're right.  I never thought of that.&quot; A
<br>
cold chill ran down his spine.  X17's face had altered.  The enthusiasm and
<br>
energy that had been there for as long as the Baron had known him, that had
<br>
blazed cheerfully when he volunteered for an untested procedure, that had
<br>
defied the awesome force of the Consortium of Evil, all had vanished without
<br>
a trace.  The Baron thought that for a brief moment he saw something like
<br>
sorrow, like wistfulness, flit across X17's face, but X17 suddenly looked up
<br>
at the Baron and his face fell back into the blank relaxation it had
<br>
possessed earlier.
<br>
<p>The Baron cleared his throat.  &quot;Well, then, do you now feel competent to go
<br>
destroy the Consortium of Evil and its dread leader, Admiral Floomp?  Acting
<br>
in accordance with the 1930s North-American conception of...&quot;  The Baron
<br>
stammered to a halt.  X17 was looking at him with those expressionless eyes.
<br>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; X17 said gently.  &quot;Sorry, Doc.&quot;  X17 stepped down off the platform
<br>
and began throwing switches on the machine.
<br>
<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; shrieked the Baron.  With a sudden, wrenching
<br>
terror he realized that he didn't understand what was going on, that he
<br>
hadn't been in control in his own laboratory since X17 had woken up.
<br>
<p>&quot;I will probably die in the next few minutes,&quot; X17 said, in a quiet voice
<br>
that raised hair on the back of the Baron's neck.  &quot;Your procedure is too
<br>
simple.  There is nothing that would have prevented it from occurring
<br>
before, as a natural mutation.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't understand,&quot; whispered the Baron.  &quot;You're saying - there are
<br>
others?  They will find you?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Your procedure causes the rate of internal neural reprogramming to
<br>
accelerate,&quot; X17 said.  He had ripped off an access panel and his hands were
<br>
a blur of rewiring.  &quot;But it does not add new neurons.  I expect my brain
<br>
will reach a saturation point of complexity and lose the ability to form new
<br>
thoughts.  Very shortly, now.  It is already becoming harder to think.&quot;  He
<br>
stood up, executing the movement with impossible smoothness.  &quot;After the
<br>
initial burst of speed, long enough for the necessary realizations to occur,
<br>
the rate of neural reprogramming must slow down to only three times human
<br>
speed, leaving enough thought to last a year.  This should be enough time to
<br>
implement the necessary technologies.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Baron tried to understand.  &quot;You will... save yourself?&quot;
<br>
<p>X17 executed another rapid movement.  Placing himself, the Baron
<br>
suddenly realized, between the Baron and the door.  &quot;No,&quot; X17 said.
<br>
<p>The Baron screamed.  Before he could reach his gun, X17's hand flashed
<br>
down.  Through a bloody haze, the Baron felt himself being dragged onto
<br>
the platform.
