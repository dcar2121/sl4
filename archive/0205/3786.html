</em><br>
<p><p>This implies a rather strange view of engineering. Engineering of all
<br>
types is about generating the Minimum Description Length of a set of
<br>
parameters. All engineers ever do is massage the system they are given
<br>
into a physical MDL of the problem. Impossibly Clever designs in any
<br>
type of engineering sense only means that you've discovered regional
<br>
minima in a design space by intuition or accident that you would have
<br>
found by rigorously reducing the apparent complexity of the system using
<br>
normal iterative methods.  The result is the same either way.
<br>
Engineering is Occam's Razor in a nutshell.  If you get the wrong
<br>
result, it is because you forgot a relevant parameter or changed the
<br>
spec in the middle of the design process.
<br>
<p>Eliezer, it sounds very much like you are arguing in favor of Ptolemic
<br>
epicycles, adding unnecessary parameters to the design space rather than
<br>
searching for a solution that represents the MDL for the parameters and
<br>
specification given.  The MDL is pretty much the definition of clever
<br>
and elegant design; whether or not a solution meets subjective aesthetic
<br>
criteria is irrelevant. Engineering complexity is not a merit badge, it
<br>
is the hallmark of bad design. I realize that AI is more open-ended than
<br>
your typical engineering project, but I would very strongly question any
<br>
claim that folding capabilities into a smaller number of unified
<br>
constructs is poor engineering; I don't see how anyone can call this
<br>
&quot;oversimplification&quot; unless one can also demonstrate which critical
<br>
parameters have necessarily been dropped in the simplification process.
<br>
<p>Proper engineering requires designing from the essential mathematics and
<br>
facts and trying to get them to intersect with the specification.  Far
<br>
too often, especially in AI, people design from the spec, adding the
<br>
essential mathematics to the function points as required to meet the
<br>
spec and attempting to tie it together later. Most engineering failures
<br>
can be attributed to not making this distinction. Both cases will yield
<br>
valid results, but the latter case will be vastly more complicated than
<br>
the former as rule and therefore much more likely to be intractable as
<br>
an engineering problem. Much of the iterative reduction that is
<br>
engineering is necessary primarily because people often design from the
<br>
spec. Unfortunately, if the &quot;design from spec&quot; approach proves to be
<br>
intractable, you'll never have a starting point from which to reduce the
<br>
problem to the elegant solution. This all applies to AI just as much as
<br>
it does from any other engineering discipline.
<br>
<p>Ben obviously has a good grasp of the pragmatic engineering issues. This
<br>
not a big deal when arguing on an emailing list, but trying to ignore
<br>
engineering tenets in practice will kill a project just as quickly as
<br>
ignoring the tenets of economics, regardless of how theoretically
<br>
correct your design is. Virtually all &quot;adequate solutions&quot; to Seed AI
<br>
are essentially intractable as engineering problems, and it is therefore
<br>
paramount that the solution attempted be as &quot;engineer-able&quot; as possible.
<br>
This also means not making any tangential design decisions until the
<br>
core parameters have been reduced to their essentials. Bad engineering
<br>
and unnecessary complexity becomes a crushing weight much faster than
<br>
most people expect in practice.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to be accusatory, just making an observation and giving
<br>
some third party feedback on this banter.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
