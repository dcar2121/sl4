<em>&gt; &gt;Post-Singularity, the sole effect of punishment for pre-Singularity crimes

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Revenge is an anthropomorphism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There is never a point where we can legitimately take pleasure in someone

<em>&gt; &gt;else's pain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am sure there are people who deserve death for their crimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't advocate revenge, but I believe in the necessity for justice.
</em><br>
<p>What is it that differentiates &quot;justice&quot; from &quot;revenge&quot; if not the
<br>
justification of maintaining order in a community?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I take no pleasure in the administration of justice.
</em><br>
<p>Why continue administering justice after the need for it is gone?  Why play
<br>
a negative-sum game?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think the Singularity should be a &quot;Get Out of Jail Free&quot; pass.
</em><br>
<p>I do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think I am alone in this position.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you're alone in this position either.  But I do think that
<br>
you, and the others who take this position, are wrong.  (And since whenever
<br>
I say &quot;wrong&quot; I get a small crowd of people demanding a definition, I'll
<br>
restate my usual position that &quot;wrong&quot; may be used to betoken at least one
<br>
of (a) inconsistency under the speaker's own standards, (b) dependency on a
<br>
factually incorrect belief, (c) reliance on an argument such that a third
<br>
party would not wish me to listen to arguments of this form.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I bet you are real popular with serial killers and child molesters.
</em><br>
<p>Not that I've noticed.  But if so, so what?  The world's stupidest man can
<br>
say the sun is shining, but that doesn't make it dark out.  The other six
<br>
billion people in the world who aren't on death row may have a higher
<br>
priority in my book for most cases, but some things help everyone - and
<br>
everyone means *everyone*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe you should look to the death row crowd for funding.
</em><br>
<p>Any game-theoretical social order needs punishment of noncooperators in
<br>
order to survive.  But punishment of nonpunishers, while a *very* powerful
<br>
stabilizer, can also stabilize a very wide variety of *bad* social orders,
<br>
including dictatorships and social orders where nobody at all is happy.  I'd
<br>
be inclined to say that punishment of nonpunishers should be considered
<br>
harmful.
<br>
<p>Does asking you not to hate really make me hateful?  Saying that I'm
<br>
harmfully wrong is one thing.  But that it makes me a bad person?  Do you
<br>
really believe that?
