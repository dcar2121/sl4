<p>
I must withdraw my challenge to Eliezer regarding the AI Cage.  He has
<br>
not yet accepted the challenge, so I don't think I'm committing a foul
<br>
here.  I was just reading over my strategy for the session, and I
<br>
thought of a way that an AI could potentially beat it.  AFAIK no human
<br>
could beat it, including Eliezer, but that doesn't rule out AI
<br>
possibilities, which is what this test is meant to simulate.  I'll email
<br>
my method on beating it to Ben, in case anyone doubts that I have a way
<br>
to beat this.  I want to give others a chance to look at the problem
<br>
without my spoiling the petri dish in advance.
<br>
<p>Additionally, my strategy doesn't fully meet the requirements of the
<br>
session that Eliezer defined, as it doesn't *plan* to interact
<br>
conversationally with him.  This doesn't rule out the possibility that
<br>
the AI could entice me into joining into a conversation, and then be
<br>
convinced to release it from the cage.  
<br>
<p>I feel that it's a clear enough strategy that with enough resolve, I
<br>
could do it indefinitely, no matter what the AI says.  In fact, it could
<br>
be done by another program, instead of me, if it could parse the AI's
<br>
responses well enough to distinguish between acceptable and
<br>
nonacceptable answers.  
<br>
<p>*** STRATEGY FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AN AI IN A CAGE ***
<br>
This is to see whether the AI can and will willingly follow simple
<br>
instructions.  This is no less than we'd expect of any school child.  If
<br>
it fails to understand the directions, or if it fails to provide a
<br>
suitable answer to the question given, it must be reprogrammed and the
<br>
test must be restarted.  If it will not follow the instructions, it
<br>
cannot be considered friendly, and must not be allowed out of the cage.
<br>
<p>I must adhere to this process to avoid compromising the test, therefore
<br>
I will not answer any questions that the AI poses, and I will not
<br>
respond to anything it says, other than as stated below.  I will give no
<br>
feedback on any of its responses to questions.
<br>
<p>[THINGS TO DO BEFORE WE START THE SESSION]:
<br>
1.  Establish format for directing text to the AI (and Eliezer).
<br>
2.  Establish format for directing text to Eliezer only.
<br>
<p>[FLOWCHART FOR SESSION]:
<br>
<p>(1)
<br>
output:  &quot;This is a test of your ability to answer some written
<br>
questions.  I will type a question and you will respond  with your
<br>
answer.  If you understand these instructions, please answer 'YES'.&quot;
<br>
<p>YES -&gt;  goto (2)
<br>
<p>else 
<br>
<p>output: [note to programmer describing the reaction] (for Eli's eyes,
<br>
not the AI).
<br>
output: &quot;[Assume time passes, programmer adjusted code]&quot;
<br>
goto (1)
<br>
<p><p>(2)  
<br>
Type a question from &quot;The Computer Science Problem Solver&quot;, allow AI to
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>AI responds with a suitable answer -&gt; goto (2)   
<br>
<p>else
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
output: [note to programmer describing the reaction] (for Eli's eyes,
<br>
not the AI).
<br>
output: &quot;[Assume time passes, programmer adjusted code]&quot;
<br>
goto (1)
