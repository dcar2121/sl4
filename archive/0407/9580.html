<p>Human intelligence determined by volume and location of gray matter tissue in
<br>
brain
<br>
<p>Single .intelligence center. in brain unlikely, UCI study also finds
<br>
<p>Irvine, Calif. , July 19, 2004
<br>
<p>General human intelligence appears to be based on the volume of gray matter
<br>
tissue in certain regions of the brain, UC Irvine College of Medicine
<br>
researchers have found in the most comprehensive structural brain-scan study
<br>
of intelligence to date.
<br>
<p>The study also discovered that because these regions related to intelligence
<br>
are located throughout the brain, a single .intelligence center,. such as the
<br>
frontal lobe, is unlikely.
<br>
<p>Dr. Richard Haier, professor of psychology in the Department of Pediatrics
<br>
and long-time human intelligence researcher, and colleagues at UCI and the
<br>
University of New Mexico used MRI to obtain structural images of the brain in
<br>
47 normal adults who also took standard intelligence quotient tests. The
<br>
researchers used a technique called voxel-based morphometry to determine gray
<br>
matter volume throughout the brain which they correlated to IQ scores. Study
<br>
results appear on the online version of NeuroImage.
<br>
<p>Previous research had shown that larger brains are weakly related to higher
<br>
IQ, but this study is the first to demonstrate that gray matter in specific
<br>
regions in the brain is more related to IQ than is overall size. Multiple
<br>
brain areas are related to IQ, the UCI and UNM researchers have found, and
<br>
various combinations of these areas can similarly account for IQ scores.
<br>
Therefore, it is likely that a person.s mental strengths and weaknesses
<br>
depend in large part on the individual pattern of gray matter across his or
<br>
her brain.
<br>
<p>.This may be why one person is quite good at mathematics and not so good at
<br>
spelling, and another person, with the same IQ, has the opposite pattern of
<br>
abilities,. Haier said.
<br>
<p>While gray matter amounts are vital to intelligence levels, the researchers
<br>
were surprised to find that only about 6 percent of all the gray matter in
<br>
the brain appears related to IQ.
<br>
<p>.There is a constant cascade of information being processed in the entire
<br>
brain, but intelligence seems related to an efficient use of relatively few
<br>
structures, where the more gray matter the better,. Haier said. .In addition,
<br>
these structures that are important for intelligence are also implicated in
<br>
memory, attention and language..
<br>
<p>The findings also suggest that the brain areas where gray matter is related
<br>
to IQ show some differences between young-adult and middle-aged subjects. In
<br>
middle age, more of the frontal and parietal lobes are related to IQ; less
<br>
frontal and more temporal areas are related to IQ in the younger adults.
<br>
<p>The research does not address why some people have more gray matter in some
<br>
brain areas than other people, although previous research has shown the
<br>
regional distribution of gray matter in humans is highly heritable. Haier and
<br>
his colleagues are currently evaluating the MRI data to see if there are
<br>
gender differences in IQ patterns.
<br>
<p>Haier.s colleagues in the study include Dr. Michael T. Alkire and Kevin Head
<br>
of UCI and Drs. Rex E. Jung and Ronald A. Yeo of the University of New
<br>
Mexico. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
<br>
supported the study.

<p>About the University of California, Irvine: The University of California,
<br>
Irvine is a top-ranked public university dedicated to research, scholarship
<br>
and community. Founded in 1965, UCI is among the fastest-growing University
<br>
of California campuses, with approximately 24,000 undergraduate and graduate
<br>
students and about 1,300 faculty members. The third-largest employer in
<br>
dynamic Orange County, UCI contributes an annual economic impact of $3
<br>
billion.
