A Federal court ruled yesterday that the Yucca Mountain repository for
<br>
nuclear waste in Nevada was illegal because the guarantee that no
<br>
radiation would leak for 10,000 years was too short; the court found
<br>
credible evidence that in 270,000 years the radiation just outside the
<br>
fence would be 60 times higher than background. Imagine if someone in
<br>
the Paleolithic had told our Cro-Magnon semi human ancestors 270,000
<br>
years ago during the Ice Age that they couldn’t use that new fangled
<br>
thing called fire until they solved the problem of global warming
<br>
produced by greenhouse gasses and found a good substitute for the finite
<br>
supply of oil. I can’t help but think plans to ensure that a super
<br>
intelligent AI will behave in ways we want it to thousands and even
<br>
millions of years in the future is at least as misplaced as that silly
<br>
federal judge. I’d say right now 20 years is about the limit, and in
<br>
time than number will decrease; trying now to solve problems that won’t
<br>
become acute until after that date is a waste of time. For anyone who
<br>
takes the ideas behind the Singularity seriously this should be obvious.
