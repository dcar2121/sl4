<p>
This is a stream of consciousness type of comments on good features of AI codes.
<br>
There are reasons for them, but they're usually omitted here. It's a curious
<br>
mix of current good practice and future (current lunatic fringe, but, it will
<br>
make sense then, trust me).
<br>
<p>* code for today's/next year's commodity iron, but think about 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;portability to massively parallel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;async molecular-electronics systems with mole amounts of switches.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They're not so far away as you think. You might actually need them.
<br>
<p>* your code should scale O(0) whether for 10^0 or 10^9 nodes (yes, it can be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;done with the right topology and communication pattern) -- if it doesn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you're doing someting really wrong. Screw Amdahl, no sequential sections
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed.
<br>
<p>* at very large (WAN and Internet2) scale, use GRID
<br>
<p>* use clusters, do not assume global connectivity (cubic primitive lattice is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a safe assumption to make, 3d is safe, higher dimensionality is iffy)
<br>
<p>* long-range is an iteration of short-range. This isn't inefficient if your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;time of flight is ~relativistic, and there are a couple gate delays in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;between -- this is for the future.
<br>
<p>* if you signal, try streaming jumbo packets, and do crunch while you stream
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(if you can't, at least try to load all interfaces at the same time, then
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;crunch a block, stream, crunch, etc.)
<br>
<p>* this is especially true if your interconnect mesh isn't unobtainium
<br>
&nbsp;(Infiniband &amp; Co)
<br>
<p>* use multiple NICs if you've got them, look at <a href="http://aggregate.org/">http://aggregate.org/</a> for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inspiration (try to hit for 6 local crossbar links for each node, though)
<br>
<p>* use a binary protocol, specifically a minimal subset of MPI (do NOT use XML over wire
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in local clusters, global networks is different)
<br>
<p>* avoid writing to disk frequently, try to do without swap. There's a special
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;case if you have a large library of patterns, and can stream sequentially,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or tolerate 10 ms fetches sometimes. There won't be any disk in the future.
<br>
<p>* try to go without local disk altogether but for checkpoints (not strictly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;necessary for future nonvolatile core)
<br>
<p>* use a spatial system composition, communicate interface state to adjacent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nodes (see cubic primitive lattice, usually 3d) -- see array
<br>
<p>* use arrays of small data types, avoid absolute pointers (use relative
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;addressing as offsets to current position) 
<br>
<p>* only access memory in stream mode, try to limit unpredictable accesses to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1st/2nd level cache (here it actually pays to use assembly for prefetch,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise don't bother with assembly but maybe for inner loop when you're
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;done. This will cut your harware budget by some 300%, ditto operation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;costs. A single guy for the hardware is enough, unless yours is a two-digit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;megabuck budget for iron alone. 
<br>
<p>* align objects to long and cache line boundaries
<br>
<p>* make sure your objects could signal locally, and asynchronosly (no global clock
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or clock with jitter) -- this is different from streaming over an array
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with a hotspot loop. This is future, not today. Make sure your code will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;survive the future.
<br>
<p>* don't use floats, stick to integers
<br>
<p>* if you use integers, try using short integers (4-8 bit is great)
<br>
<p>* stick to integers and codes you can crunch in parallel with MMX/SSE* type
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of SWAR SIMD
<br>
<p>* get ready for very wide words, low latency, small cores and FPGA (think
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inner loop in FPGA)
<br>
<p>* make sure your inner loop would translate into logic some 10^3 gates simple
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for each individual small integer
<br>
<p>* put the complexity into data pattern, not code pattern. Code is not that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;important, state is.
<br>
<p>* if you think you can't do it in C, or don't need to, you're doing it wrong
<br>
<p>* if can't describe the algorithm and the data flow on a large piece of paper, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you're doing it wrong 
<br>
<p>* on the long run, get ready for crystalline hardware (moles of switches,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;local connectivity, nonvolatile state, relativistically constrained signalling)
<br>
<p>If you can't state your problem in above framework, you're doing it the hard
<br>
way. If none of it appears relevant, and you in fact think I'm nuts then you won't
<br>
succeed. Probably.
