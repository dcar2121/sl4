</em><br>
<p>I think if we can have massive parallel processing, then
<br>
human-like intelligence would be fairly easy. There is no
<br>
dispute about this, but the controversy is over how to do
<br>
it. There're 3 possible ways (probably more):
<br>
<p>1. As Eliezer suggested in LOGI, try to exploit the strengths
<br>
of von Neumann hardware (floating point math &amp; stuff).
<br>
But you need to be very clever. Also, some problems have
<br>
been shown to be inapproximable in polynomial time.
<br>
<p>2. DNA computing. DNA can do hybridization, which can be
<br>
seen as a sort of approximate string matching which is an
<br>
NP-hard problem. So what's the problem? I think the
<br>
problem is that there is currently no way of synthesizing de
<br>
novo DNA sequences *without* a template. If you MUST
<br>
use a template, that means you're not free to choose the
<br>
variables (which is required by the NP problem). Therefore
<br>
it boils down to a way to synthesize DNA sequences at will.
<br>
This, unfortunately, is almost as hard as molecular nanotech.
<br>
<p>3. Silicon-based parallelism. The approach developed by
<br>
Stan Williams at HP Labs (and some others as well), basically
<br>
the cross-bar array with molecules trapped in between. But
<br>
this also has a serious problem. The silicon problem is all
<br>
about *wiring*, and any chip must have its number of pins
<br>
somewhat &lt; 1000 (currently). That almost forces you to use
<br>
multiplexing. The result is that at any time, the number of
<br>
bits being addressed *simultaneously* is constrained by
<br>
the number of pins (~ wires).
<br>
<p>Very serious problems ahead.
<br>
