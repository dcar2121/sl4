<em>&gt; So, let's say 2 people see films of people getting tortured.  The 1st
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person really enjoys it, the 2nd person gets sick.  Are you saying it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be good to make adjustments so the 2nd person can enjoy it too?
</em><br>
<p>Ok, just for sake of discussion I am going to actually consider such
<br>
scenarios.
<br>
The real issue is not with the watchers but with the people who are
<br>
tortured! :-)
<br>
<p>if the universe was a 10 square meter room and the movie was made with 3d
<br>
characters and there was no other element in the equation then of course
<br>
making one person enjoy the movie would be ok, or, better than have them
<br>
throw up for eternity. In a complex system the real solution is getting rid
<br>
of adversarial situations and evolved cruelty so that torture is not
<br>
practiced and nobody has to watch the movie.
<br>
If there is a particular pleasurable quale for watching people being
<br>
tortured (there probably is) then we could choose to explore this territory
<br>
with direct brain stimulation ... There is an infinite variety of
<br>
pleasurable sensations out there (proven by the fact that you can find at
<br>
least one person who likes any arbitrary thing or activity) ... taboo
<br>
pleasures which today require creation of a massively unfair qualia balance
<br>
(such as torture) can be made available by direct brain stimulation. if
<br>
nobody really gets tortured, then I guess it's ok...
<br>
<p>though the main goal of qualia morality is getting rid of real torture not
<br>
allowing sadists to get their thrill legally.
<br>
