How is it relevant for a bunch of decidedly amateur philosophers to
<br>
chase what is morality or qualia and so on around in circles?   If the
<br>
problem of rational ethics is going to be solved I expect it will be
<br>
solved by persons who dedicate more time and care to the subject than
<br>
any of us are likely to.  I also suspect that the solution will not be
<br>
arrived at in an e-mail exchange.
<br>
<p>I know precisely why I am displeased with qualia based morality.   It
<br>
is devoid of any real connection to what I consider morality to be.  
<br>
It is also rather non-objective in that qualia are not even suitably
<br>
defined and what are and are not &quot;positive&quot; qualia seems to be
<br>
somewhat subjective to the sentients experiencing them.
<br>
<p>If we can't tell when a proposed answer to the question of objective
<br>
ethics/morality is not at all adequate, then why should we believe
<br>
ourselves capable of addressing this question successfully in this
<br>
format?
<br>
<p>I hope your last few statements above are pure sarcasm.   If not then
<br>
they may represent the most self-centered, narcissistic sentiment I
<br>
have ever encountered.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, the majority isn't very pleased with the qualia based moral, but

<em>&gt; Face it, the investigating of Mars could be quite a doll task for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhuman, except for the first 15 minutes. There isn't very much to
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the total amount of good feelings it may yield to some sentients.
</em><br>
