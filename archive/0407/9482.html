<p>No, it isn't.  Morality is part of ethics.  It is about the behavior 
<br>
that is proper between sentient beings.   That some of this behavior 
<br>
&quot;feels good&quot; says we have found some parts of what we consider moral of 
<br>
value (and trained ourselves to &quot;feel good when doing it)  and/or  
<br>
become evolutionarily wired to enjoy them.   Saying that what we enjoy 
<br>
is per se what is moral puts the cart before the horse.   This is why I 
<br>
object to your approach.
<br>
<p>Many behaviors that are moral are not accompanied by feeling good.  
<br>
Some of them are things that may feel quite bad or be counter to our 
<br>
immediate well-being but are what we nonetheless believe is appropriate 
<br>
behavior between sentients.   If this ability to go beyond what feels 
<br>
good did not exist then we would be forever at the mercy of our 
<br>
evolutionary programming.    We would also conclude that such 
<br>
gaucheries as being wired to a non-addictive, non-debilitating heroin 
<br>
supply is a fine solution for maximizing moral value to human beings.
