SIAI RELEASES WEBSITE ON AI ETHICS COINCIDING WITH &quot;I, ROBOT&quot; FILM
<br>
<p>ATLANTA, GA - In anticipation of 20th Century Fox's July 16th 
<br>
release of I, Robot, the Singularity Institute announces &quot;3 Laws 
<br>
Unsafe&quot; (<a href="http://www.asimovlaws.com">http://www.asimovlaws.com</a>). &quot;3 Laws Unsafe&quot; explores the 
<br>
problems presented by Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, the 
<br>
principles intended for ensuring that robots help, but never harm, 
<br>
humans. The Three Laws are widely known and are often taken 
<br>
seriously as reasonable solutions for guiding future AI. But are 
<br>
they truly reasonable? &quot;3 Laws Unsafe&quot; addresses this question.
<br>
<p>Tyler Emerson, Executive Director of the Singularity Institute: 
<br>
&quot;The release of I, Robot is a wonderful chance to engage more 
<br>
people about the perils and promise of strong AI research. The 
<br>
constraints portrayed in I, Robot appear extremely dangerous and 
<br>
excessively lacking as an approach to moral AI. The Singularity 
<br>
Institute's detailed approach, by contrast, utilizes advanced 
<br>
technical research for creating a mind that is humane in nature.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;3 Laws Unsafe&quot; will include articles by several authors, weekly 
<br>
poll questions, a blog for announcements and commentary related to 
<br>
I, Robot and the Three Laws, a free newsletter subscription, and a 
<br>
reading list with books on relevant topics such as the future of 
<br>
AI, accelerating change, cognitive science and nanotechnology.
<br>
<p>The Singularity Institute's Advocacy Director, Michael Anissimov: 
<br>
&quot;It is essential that more considerate thinkers get involved in 
<br>
dialogues of AI ethics and strategy. Although AI as a discipline 
<br>
has a dubious history of false starts, the accelerating growth of 
<br>
computing power and brain science knowledge will very likely result 
<br>
in its creation at some point. In the past few years, technologists 
<br>
such as Ray Kurzweil and Bill Joy have been informing the public 
<br>
about this critical issue; but much more awareness is now needed.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence (SIAI) was 
<br>
founded in 2000 for the pursuit of ethically enhanced intelligence 
<br>
by creating humane AI. SIAI believes the ethical and significant 
<br>
enhancement of intelligence will help solve contemporary problems, 
<br>
such as disease and illness, poverty and hunger, more readily than 
<br>
other philanthropic causes. SIAI is a tax-exempt non-profit 
<br>
organization with branches in Canada and the United States.
