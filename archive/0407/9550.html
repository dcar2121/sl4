<p>
The Second Cognitive Systems Workshop, hosted by Sandia National
<br>
Laboratories and the University of New Mexico has just taken place
<br>
(<a href="http://www.sandia.gov/cog.systems/cognitive_workshop/index.htm">http://www.sandia.gov/cog.systems/cognitive_workshop/index.htm</a>). An array
<br>
of government program offices, universities and private companies, including
<br>
us, presented the result of different approaches to the development of new
<br>
cognitive systems. Agents, Neural Networks, AI bots and artificial brains
<br>
projects, most of then with an emphasis on defense applications, where
<br>
discussed and even showcased to a list of pre-screened attendees.
<br>
<p>Apparently Artificial Development is no longer alone attempting a full-force
<br>
cortex emulation, as a few other groups push for similar projects under
<br>
DARPA funded programs. However, I'm very please to say that we do lead the
<br>
pack: I introduced during my keynote the 'Kjell' Persona
<br>
(<a href="http://www.ad.com/press/jun302004.html">http://www.ad.com/press/jun302004.html</a>), our firs CCortex-based Autonomous
<br>
Cognitive System, and discussed in detail the preliminary results of
<br>
intensive testing of CCortex emerging cognitive capabilities. We also
<br>
announced a new India research center, where 50+ extra neurologist and
<br>
programmers will joint the American and European teams already working on
<br>
the project, as the very encouraging 'Kjell' results has prompted us to
<br>
speedup development and update our internal Roadmap: A few surprises are
<br>
coming your way, you have been warned :)
<br>
<p>Anyhow, enough CEO parlance already. I was wondering how you factor the
<br>
defense industry predictable entry in this area with the 'friendly AI'
<br>
thinking. I assume that you have always considered how likely it is that the
<br>
first successful AI happens to be a no-so-friendly defense project.
<br>
<p>I do understand that we all love to discuss about qualia and high level
<br>
ethics, but I will also like to politely suggest that maybe we should start
<br>
to consider a more down to earth approach to the most likely scenario: the
<br>
progressive incorporation of Autonomous Cognitive Systems to the world
<br>
military forces, whit limited political supervision.
<br>
<p>In such a scenario, a comprehensive 'friendliness' approach would be
<br>
unworkable, while any proposed limitation to system design would have to be
<br>
hammered out between the industry, the public, the politicians, and, let's
<br>
hope, some scientific input. 
<br>
<p>So, what about re-focusing part of the discussion to such a plan-B,
<br>
compromise scenario? If no authorized voice starts tackling the problem from
<br>
this perspective,  we risk the debate may end up being hijacked by
<br>
uninformed demagogues, fringe populist, and the tinfoil-hat brigade, very
<br>
much the same think that happen with the steam cells research, a very
<br>
unpleasant situation for any industry.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Best Regards,
<br>
