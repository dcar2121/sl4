</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Several posters (including me) have tried to make this point. Qualia is 
<br>
a fictional entity, given whatever properties are needed to keep the 
<br>
discussion going round in circles.
<br>
<p>Can I refer those interested to a professional philosopher's site?
<br>
namely, Daniel Dennett.
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/">http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>Specifically to his lengthy paper, Quining Qualia, with references for 
<br>
further reading, which opposes the qualia mystics.
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/quinqual.htm">http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/quinqual.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;My claim--which can only come into focus as we proceed--is that 
<br>
conscious experience has no properties that are special in any of the 
<br>
ways qualia have been supposed to be special.&quot;
<br>
<p>Final paragraph -
<br>
&nbsp;&quot;So when we look one last time at our original characterization of 
<br>
qualia, as ineffable, intrinsic, private, directly apprehensible 
<br>
properties of experience, we find that there is nothing to fill the 
<br>
bill. In their place are relatively or practically ineffable public 
<br>
properties we can refer to indirectly via reference to our private 
<br>
property-detectors-- private only in the sense of idiosyncratic. And 
<br>
insofar as we wish to cling to our subjective authority about the 
<br>
occurrence within us of states of certain types or with certain 
<br>
properties, we can have some authority--not infallibility or 
<br>
incorrigibility, but something better than sheer guessing--but only if 
<br>
we restrict ourselves to relational, extrinsic properties like the power 
<br>
of certain internal states of ours to provoke acts of apparent re- 
<br>
identification. So contrary to what seems obvious at first blush, there 
<br>
simply are no qualia at all.&quot;
