<em>&gt; How is it relevant for a bunch of decidedly amateur philosophers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chase what is morality or qualia and so on around in circles?   If the
</em><br>
<p>Morality should be the philosophy of the masses. We shouldn't expect
<br>
professional philosophers to all of a sudden come down from a mountain and
<br>
give us stone tablets with the definitions (and with incomprehensible
<br>
mathematical proofs). I can talk about qualia morality to anyone at a dinner
<br>
table. See I stab them in the hand with a fork, and I ask them how did that
<br>
feel, so they say OUCH, I say great then I stab the next person at the table
<br>
and ask the first person how do you think she felt, they say not good! So I
<br>
say should we make a rule that at this table nobody gets stabbed? They agree
<br>
right away, so I ask what about their cat, they say yeah the cat too, there
<br>
you have qualia based objective morality :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and what are and are not &quot;positive&quot; qualia seems to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat subjective to the sentients experiencing them.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree, a couple of objections have been raised mostly regarding SM, but
<br>
as I pointed out earlier, liking item A and not liking it are different
<br>
qualia altogether; one is positive and one is negative. The sensation that
<br>
went with eating spicy food when I didn't like it, and the sensation of
<br>
eating spicy food now that I like it, are completely different.
