<p>Soldiers may be soldiers for more reasons other than a well understood
<br>
choice:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;1) They may need the money and signup for the military in peace time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;2) They may be recruited for a war with a serious misunderstanding of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whats involved in real war. Rarely do any 'lofty' ideals surrounding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the war survive actual combat.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;3) They may have been drafted.
<br>
<p>However what matters isn't the experience of the war in #2, its the
<br>
decision to 'self sacrifice' at the recruitment center, after that they
<br>
are stuck. A suicide bomber may decide in the few instants after blowing
<br>
themselves up before full death that this really sucks, but again its
<br>
too late.
<br>
<p>However there are cases where one makes such a choice and its pleasure
<br>
throughout. Some of the accounts by the Christian Saints of there
<br>
punishment for good deeds includes this, not to mention that masochistic
<br>
pleasure in general often includes this component. Enough that it
<br>
overrides ordinary perception of possibly quite severe pain.
