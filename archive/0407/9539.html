</em><br>
<p>Can we try to cut down on the smirky one line replies that don't
<br>
really address the previous post? I pick on this one here because it's
<br>
particularly egregious, but it's been rather emblematic of the list of
<br>
late for people to snipe pickily at each other.
<br>
<p>Yes, people are animals, very droll. But not exactly contentful. Eugen
<br>
made several other more interesting points in the last email, which
<br>
are dissapointingly ignored.
<br>
<p>I don't know that I side particularly on the qualia issue with either
<br>
set of posters, but I think it's quite clear that it doesn't seem to
<br>
be progressing very much. I'm not the List Sniper, but I think the
<br>
discussion should probably be redefined and continued under new
<br>
auspices, or shelved, for the time being.
<br>
<p>It's interesting to note, that even under the best of circumstances,
<br>
there are people who think that people are moving too fast and
<br>
dismissing possibilities out of hand, and those who think the process
<br>
is already waiting too long, and giving too much creedence to minority
<br>
or unlikely propositions.
<br>
<p>There are lots of proposed solutions to satisficing a differential set
<br>
of expectations in environments like email lists. The more scientific
<br>
and efficiency minded tend to tinker and suggest automated debating
<br>
systems, mod or authority systems, work flow engines, and the like.
<br>
<p>More holistic, or concerned folk suggest points of order, hierarchies
<br>
of judges, social conventions, and so on.
<br>
<p>I've never seen any, even some of the ones I've invented and worked on
<br>
myself that I was convinced would work in any real way except by
<br>
self-selecting for people who were so focused on getting it to work
<br>
that a group consisting of only such people would have worked anyway,
<br>
system or no. Which may not be a bad solution, in a pragmatic sense.
<br>
<p>But that's very unsatisfying. I get the feeling that there ought to be
<br>
a way to make these email lists work for us, so to speak, rather than
<br>
becoming sinks of time.
<br>
<p>Maybe the answer is having clear expectations and comparisons of the
<br>
overlap and differenes between those and other people's.
<br>
<p>I read SL4 because on average it's quieter and more focused on the
<br>
kind of things I'm interested in. It's a relatively exclusive
<br>
membership, and with some exceptions, it doesn't have posts on it that
<br>
make me wince with sympathy for whatever poor fool gets sucked into a
<br>
well established basic point or quagmire.
<br>
<p>I like the posts and conversations that quickly summarize and present
<br>
the positions and data behind them for interesting or unresolved kinds
<br>
of questions in AI, Cognitive Theory, futurism, and other core topics.
<br>
I like shocking and clever posts. I like posts that have little
<br>
mention of their authors personally, unless the author is somehow
<br>
involved in the story or is part of the subject being discussed. The
<br>
issue should be separatable from the combatants. I like posts that I
<br>
can't immediately tell who is writing the message by the point or
<br>
structure. A really good argument is independent.
<br>
<p>A possible exception to this is Samantha, because I can always tell
<br>
it's her by the formatting. (but I still like some of her posts!)
<br>
<p>I don't like posts that are repetitive, either within themselves, or
<br>
in the larger thread or conversation. If you've made a point, and
<br>
someone adds something else to the discussion, please don't write a
<br>
post reiterating your previous point because the other person had
<br>
their turn, and it's your turn to talk more now. We all read the last
<br>
email. Your argument didn't get any better in the meantime. It worked
<br>
or didn't. (This goes for people who are right also. The truth can
<br>
also be boring.)
<br>
<p>I don't like boring rivalries. I dont' know what the resolution is
<br>
here. But many a time, I've wished that two duelists would either just
<br>
give up and start screaming obscenities at each other, or grown some
<br>
manners. I have no idea which would be more entertaining, but I know
<br>
which would be more universally appealing. Please don't get worked up
<br>
or dumb, it's just email.
<br>
<p>I don't like vague handwaving, or &quot;I guess&quot;es without new information,
<br>
or guiding value.
<br>
<p>Those are the largest and most recent issues I can think of. And I
<br>
admit I don't know how universally they are shared amongst list
<br>
membership. But maybe if we can determine what the list membership
<br>
/does/ want. We can step towards that. And get less killthreads and
<br>
complaining rants by lurkers and list readers about their precious
<br>
bandwidth and dilution of favored info watering holes. :-)
