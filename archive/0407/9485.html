<em>&gt; No, it isn't.  Morality is part of ethics.  It is about the behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is proper between sentient beings.   That some of this behavior
</em><br>
<p>ok so this is the happy ending where we finally find out you were talking
<br>
about russian verb endings and I was talking about green melons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;feels good&quot; says we have found some parts of what we consider moral of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value (and trained ourselves to &quot;feel good when doing it)  and/or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become evolutionarily wired to enjoy them.   Saying that what we enjoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is per se what is moral puts the cart before the horse.   This is why I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object to your approach.
</em><br>
<p>the distinction is between this 3rd person knowledge and the qualities of
<br>
the 1st person experiences it generates. I am not interested in the 3rd
<br>
person. It is utterly boring, a configuration of atoms that means absolutely
<br>
nothing. Being obsessed with the 3rd person perspective is like having two
<br>
big bags full of lego bricks and trying to put them together in all possible
<br>
configurations. We maximized information density d00d! Check it out we are
<br>
doing ftl travel! And _who_ cares! If nobody is there to see it and
<br>
experience the sweet qualia these things would produce in (some) humans. And
<br>
if you can feel the lego castle and the lego city and the lego police
<br>
department without the actual bricks, then why bother with the bricks at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; behavior between sentients.   If this ability to go beyond what feels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good did not exist then we would be forever at the mercy of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary programming.    We would also conclude that such
</em><br>
<p>once more, I am detaching the phenomenon of feeling good in the 1st person,
<br>
from everything else that is normally attached to it! I am not saying we
<br>
should satisfy evolved wiring, I am saying we should eliminate negative
<br>
sensations from the universe. The wiring and the end result are different,
<br>
like acceleration and the combustion engine.
<br>
I'm saying, there should not be something it's like for you to dislike
<br>
something. the rest, I leave it up to the brick-savvy people.
