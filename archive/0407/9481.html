<p>It is not a &quot;magical rule&quot;.  But there are limits to human 
<br>
computational ability.   Many of us run into those limits in the things 
<br>
we attempt to understand and do quite often.  It would be a sad 
<br>
universe if no intelligence with great computational abilities, could 
<br>
improve on our limits.   A sufficiently learned human still works at 
<br>
the roughly same speed with no larger a conscious attention queue and 
<br>
so on.     There are many problems today of crucial interest to humans 
<br>
and human survival, that are apparently beyond our limitations.  True, 
<br>
we build specialized computational and other tools to address some of 
<br>
it.  But the human in the loop is still a very real limitation to what 
<br>
can be done.
<br>
<p>If the AI makes things &quot;simpler for humans to understand&quot; implies there 
<br>
are things the AI can do that humans cannot.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>ALARM!   The humans are about to figure out that *they* are in a box!  
<br>
The simulated universe designed to solve the safe creation of AI is

failing to produce the desired results..
