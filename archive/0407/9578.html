X-Mailer: MIME::Lite 1.4  (F2.72; T1.001; A1.62; B3.01; Q3.01)
<br>
<p>Meeting notice: The 04.July.20 meeting will be held at 7:30 P.M. at 
<br>
the Royal East (782 Main St., Cambridge), a block down from the corner 
<br>
of Main St. and Mass Ave.  If you're new and can't recognize us, ask 
<br>
the manager. He'll probably know where we are. More details below.
<br>
<p>Suggested topic of the week:  Strong AI and where is it?
<br>
<p>Half of what we talk about -- at least when we get within shouting
<br>
distance of our raison detre -- depends on the development of 
<br>
something called 'strong AI'.
<br>
<p>The term was invented by the philosopher John Searle to refer to 
<br>
computers with minds or consciousnesses.  The meaning we intend when 
<br>
we use the term was (I think) articulated by Ray Solomonoff: the 
<br>
ability to do science, math, and engineering as well as a reasonably 
<br>
competent human.  (At least I first heard this usage from Ray.)
<br>
<p>Note that within this definition a strong AI doesn't have to perform 
<br>
better than humans or even as well as the best human.  For Solomonoff 
<br>
the test is generality: a strong AI has to be able to find its 
<br>
bearings and operate competently in a very wide range of fields, from 
<br>
physics to engineering, from biotech to electrical, from protein 
<br>
folding to biosynthesis.  Once trained to a field, it has to be able 
<br>
to handle the same range of problems over the same variety of contexts 
<br>
as a professional engineer does during his or her work day, without 
<br>
taking any more time to do so than that human would.
<br>
<p>I think a reasonable but not definitive argument can be made that over 
<br>
the past thirty years progress on this issue -- generality -- has been 
<br>
zero to negative.  (You get negative progress when people give up and 
<br>
leave the field.) What progress has been achieved on the AI agenda has 
<br>
come from evading the problem. Chess programs compensate for their 
<br>
inability to recognize strong and weak positions as well as even 
<br>
middling players by doing much better at calculating lookaheads. 
<br>
Speech recognizers work by compiling huge databases of phoneme 
<br>
patterns instead of recognizing semantics.  Machine vision is making 
<br>
some progress (with very simple applications, like license plate 
<br>
recognition) because installations can be lit with LEDs, thus 
<br>
eliminating a source of variation that humans are mostly unaware of 
<br>
but which was killing the technology.
<br>
<p>Agenda items whose variability can not be evaded, like Go or Natural
<br>
Language Recognition or for that matter lots of machine vision apps,
<br>
like counting the number of people in a crowd or extracting spatial
<br>
measurements from a photo, are going nowhere, or nowhere fast,
<br>
assuming the standard of reasonably competent human performance.  Not
<br>
that that standard can't be lowered. Train a pigeon on a leaf and it
<br>
will recognize leaves of that kind in all kinds of orientations, light
<br>
levels, distances, life cycle stages, and even disrepair.  Even
<br>
defined down like this, such accomplishments are still way out of
<br>
reach for our machines.
<br>
<p>Any solution to the generality problem might cascade overnight into an 
<br>
immensely powerful technology.  I see no clear way of distinguishing 
<br>
between the variability that must be mastered in decoding a scene 
<br>
visually, handling objects, and solving low-level problems like 
<br>
tolerances and structural integrity and manufactureability, and 
<br>
managing the high- level variations involved with moving from 
<br>
electrical to mechanical engineering or from engineering to physics. A 
<br>
solution to the variation problem on one level might work on all of 
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps our failure to date is pointing to 
<br>
something deep about the difference between digital and analog 
<br>
systems, though Lord knows what.
<br>
<p>In any event, if we can't build machines that can solve reasonably 
<br>
hard engineering problems on their own, unattended, all manner of 
<br>
complex engineering systems will be out of reach for a long time, from 
<br>
the &quot;Scientist's Assistant&quot; (an automated first-year grad student) to 
<br>
most of the high- end nanotech apps, with the assembler first on the 
<br>
list.

<br>
<p>In twenty years half the population of Europe will have visited the
<br>
moon.

else. If you wish to subscribe to this list (perhaps having received a
