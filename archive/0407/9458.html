<em>&gt; But morality is inherently about what feels good.
</em><br>
According to WordNet 2.0 (August 2003):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;morality
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n 1: concern with the distinction between good and evil or right
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wrong; right or good conduct [ant: {immorality}]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2: motivation based on ideas of right and wrong [syn: {ethical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motive}, {ethics}, {morals}]
<br>
<p>Whether feelings are inherently (i.e. aside from being physical processes) 
<br>
relevant for an arbitrary morality depends on the morality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; without &quot;feelings&quot; of some sort, morality isn't needed.
</em><br>
A sentient being needs a goal system of some sort to determine which actions to 
<br>
take. Morality seems to me as just a (somewhat muddled because of historical 
<br>
attempts) way of thinking about goal systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If something doesn't feel like something, then it is irrelevant.
</em><br>
That's one of the assumptions of the kind of morality you personally believe to 
<br>
be correct (one based on qualia). This assumption shouldn't be made for 
<br>
discussions of moralities in general since it is not shared between all possible 
<br>
moralities.
