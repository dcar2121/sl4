<em>&gt; That's one of the assumptions of the kind of morality you personally believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be correct (one based on qualia). This assumption shouldn't be made for

<p><p>But it IS in the nature of human beings to live out the happiness principle. 
<br>
You make every decision based on whether it makes you more happy, or less
<br>
unhappy.  And you fabricate (ethical) philosophical rationalizations as to why
<br>
you do it, but in the end the solution is simple:  understand your nature,
<br>
understand what things make you HAPPY, and maximize those.  However, I agree
<br>
with you that that only applies to humans, and the possibilies for AI ethics
<br>
are wider.  But, as long as we're talking about what AIs should do FOR humans,
<br>
how they should fulfill our volition, etc., to that extent, their morality
<br>
should be the same.

<br>
<p>P.S. I tend not to get into the qualia debate, as the jury is still out for me.
