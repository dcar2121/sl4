<p>I do not believe that that is a corollary at all. This is a general
<br>
statement about usefulness and understanding. I don't think of
<br>
understanding as the ability to know all parts of a given field,
<br>
merely those abstractions which fit together to make the whole which
<br>
is useful. We don't need to constantly calculate PI to be able to use
<br>
it in transformations where it is useful, because we have already
<br>
calculated it. This is why I say &quot;useful.&quot; I don't think it is
<br>
&quot;useful&quot; to calculate PI to some absurd length every time you use PI.
<br>
A super AI may, just for the heck of it, but even then I find that
<br>
unlikely (it would be a waste of resources, and even the dumbest AI
<br>
knows what a cache is).
<br>
<p>Abstractions, they are what has brung us this far, and can take us far
<br>
further. Even if a super AI has created some extremely intriciate
<br>
thing, I believe that abstractions can make that thing tangible. If it
<br>
cannot be tangible, I believe that it probably wouldn't be useful (say
<br>
it creates some absurdly complex function which just... spits out
<br>
numbers).
<br>
<p>A super AI might say &quot;here are the algorithms we use to manipulate
<br>
matter at the nanoscale, now go off and build a matter manipulator&quot;
<br>
and I believe a human could understand it... eventually. Even if that
<br>
human has to abstract the process down into lots of little things
<br>
&quot;here's a computer which runs a program which affects various chemical
<br>
reactions in a certain environment to manipulate matter for me.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'd hate to say it, and I've been trying not to respond this way (I
<br>
personally don't have the time/energy for a big debate about this,
<br>
though, so I probably won't even be responding, though I'll be reading
<br>
of course), but I don't think there's much of a difference between a
<br>
super AI unconsciously doing some task, and a human using an extension
<br>
of self, say, a computer, to achieve a similar task. This is somewhat
<br>
why I am more inclined to lean toward Kurzweil as far as how the
<br>
Singularity is to come about, but the Singingularity Institute does
<br>
offer an interesting approach.
<br>
<p>Just my very humble opinion, though.
