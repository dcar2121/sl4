<em>&gt; &gt; I believe you will find out that if you ask a statistically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant proportion of soldiers in modern history 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (mercenaries are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; another story) they'd tell you they're not happy soldiering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soldiers may be soldiers for more reasons other than a well understood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1) They may need the money and signup for the military in peace time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  2) They may be recruited for a war with a serious misunderstanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     whats involved in real war. Rarely do any 'lofty' ideals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the war survive actual combat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  3) They may have been drafted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However what matters isn't the experience of the war in #2, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its the decision to 'self sacrifice' at the recruitment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; center, after that they are stuck. A suicide bomber may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide in the few instants after blowing themselves up before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; full death that this really sucks, but again its too late.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However there are cases where one makes such a choice and its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure throughout. Some of the accounts by the Christian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saints of there punishment for good deeds includes this, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mention that masochistic pleasure in general often 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes this component. Enough that it overrides ordinary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception of possibly quite severe pain.
</em><br>
<p><p>I believe most Army grunts will tell you they don't fight for the
<br>
political purposes, they fight mostly for their fellow soldiers in their
<br>
unit.  When separated from their unit, most want to hurry up and get
<br>
back, because they don't want to let their team down.  The desire for
<br>
happiness may figure in at some level, but it's covered with layers of
<br>
group dynamics, the desire to belong, one's responsibility to the team,
<br>
etc.
