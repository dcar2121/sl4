</em><br>
Not on a conscious level; happiness is not a highest-level goal of my conscious 
<br>
goal system.
<br>
My subconscious tries to motivate my conscious mind to strive for a state of 
<br>
mind we call &quot;happy&quot;. This dynamic is designed to motivate my conscious mind to 
<br>
behave in patterns that were in the EEA effective at spreading one's genes.
<br>
Tracing back causality, what I should really do to satisfy the dynamic that 
<br>
eventually led to me perceiving happiness is to try to fill the universe with 
<br>
the maximum amount of copies of my genetic code as possible.
<br>
The design of the human brain, including the tendency to strive for positive 
<br>
qualia, is the result of evolution, an afaik morally neutral process.
<br>
Patterns, including the mental properties of organisms, do not obtain moral 
<br>
value merely because evolution happened to produce them; just as paper clips do 
<br>
not obtain moral value merely because they exist in reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And you fabricate (ethical) philosophical rationalizations as to why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do it, but in the end the solution is simple:  understand your nature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand what things make you HAPPY, and maximize those.
</em><br>
The solution to what problem, exactly? If it's to &quot;reach personal happiness&quot;, it 
<br>
is not relevant for this discussion (since I don't agree that &quot;reaching personal 
<br>
happiness&quot; is a valid highest-level goal).
<br>
If the problem is to &quot;satisfy the processes that led to humans perceiving 
<br>
happiness&quot;, the solution is afaict incorrect.
<br>
If you propose it as a solution to &quot;acting morally&quot;, i.e. &quot;doing the right 
<br>
thing&quot;, it is merely a statement without justification.
