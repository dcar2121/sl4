</em><br>
<p>I don't think there's some magical rule in the universe that says that
<br>
humans can't create such a thing, just for the record. I do not
<br>
believe that there exist useful things that an AI could understand
<br>
which a sufficiently learned human could not. Sure, an AI could know
<br>
five quadrillion digits of PI, that does not necessarily mean that
<br>
that is remotely useful to humans. If anything, an AI could make
<br>
things simplier for humans to understand, technological simplification
<br>
could be the actual results rather than the opposite.
<br>
<p>But we don't need to simulate the whole universe, just what areas
<br>
we're allowing the AI to explore or experience. Remember, we want
<br>
useful stuff from the AI, in our universe it (the AI) could be in a
<br>
&quot;box&quot; somewhere in a lab in some company which is attempting to create
<br>
AI. (Whoa, try to twist your brain around that, a AIBox as an AI in a
<br>
box in a virtual universe!) It'd only know the books we've given it to
<br>
read, newspapers, and so on. At this point the simulator would need
<br>
only be in the box that it really is on, we don't really put it into a
<br>
virtual universe until it designs technology for us that allows us to
<br>
create the box in the first place. We can essentially use the AI to be
<br>
one step ahead of itself. Kind of sneaky, but workable.
<br>
<p>Of course, you might argue that stopping the simulation to work on
<br>
anything the AI invents for us would clue it in to time passage (say
<br>
we turn the machine off to build nanotechnology it designed; which
<br>
results in the stars changing their alignment, etc, it would see an
<br>
instant change in the alignment of many many events it can observe),
<br>
but this is sufficiently quelled by recording all data inputs that the
<br>
AI would recieve and plugging them into the resulting virtual universe
<br>
that we have created. Basically, the start of the virtual universe
<br>
will be the end of the real universe. It could be totally unnoticable
<br>
to an AI. An AI can't know what doesn't exist. We're essentially
<br>
talking about an AI trying to get out of a box that has no evidence
<br>
for its existance.
