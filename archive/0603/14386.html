&nbsp;Hi all,
<br>
<p>This conference looks potentially interesting.
<br>
<p>Not SL4 but SL3 at any rate...

<br>
<p>*Toward Social Mechanisms of Android Science*

Vancouver , Canada, 26 July 2006
<br>

<br>
<p>Authors are invited to submit two-page extended abstracts to the ICCS-2006
<br>
Symposium, Toward Social Mechanisms of Android Science, to be held the
<br>
afternoon of July 26, 2006 at the Sheraton Wall Centre in Vancouver, Canada.
<br>
The workshop is part of the Fifth International Conference of the Cognitive
<br>
Science Society (Asia-Pacific region) and is co-located with the 28th Annual
<br>
Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. Abstracts may be accepted for
<br>
either oral or poster presentation and should be received by March 30, 2006.
<br>
<p><p>*Theme and goals*
<br>
The embodiment of social and cognitive theories in interactive robots sets a
<br>
high bar for their evaluation. Theories that reify descriptions relying on a
<br>
human interpreter for their grounding cannot be implemented in autonomous
<br>
systems. The demands of coherently integrating responses cross-modally and
<br>
coping with open, socially complex environments limit the applicability of
<br>
theories that &quot;grew up in the laboratory.&quot; Androids will be confronted with
<br>
circumstances that exhibit complex closely-coordinated social dynamics,
<br>
where stable patterns emerge at various spatial and temporal scales, and
<br>
expectations depend in part on a histories of interaction that are unique to
<br>
individual relationships.
<br>
<p>We define an android to be an artificial system that has humanlike behavior
<br>
and appearance and is capable of sustaining natural relationships with
<br>
people. Although people may know that an android is not human, they would
<br>
treat it as if it were, owing to the largely subconscious responses it would
<br>
elicit. To pass the Total Turing Test, an android would need have the
<br>
inclination toward &quot;mind reading&quot; that is characteristic of people. The
<br>
development of androids is beyond the scope of mere engineering because, to
<br>
make the android humanlike, we must investigate human activity, and to
<br>
evaluate theories of human activity accurately, we need to implement them in
<br>
an android. Thus, we need an android science.
<br>
<p>The aim of this workshop is to begin to lay a foundation for research in
<br>
android science, a new field that integrates the synthetic approach from
<br>
robotics with the empirical methodologies of the social sciences.
<br>
Participants, coming from engineering and the social, cognitive, and
<br>
biological sciences seek fundamental principles underlying cognition and
<br>
communication between individuals. Cognition is not viewed as solely a
<br>
property of brains, to be understood at a micro-structural level, nor as
<br>
socially-definable and separable from biomechanical or sensorimotor
<br>
constraints. By highlighting agent-world relations, androids have the
<br>
potential for helping researchers to bridge the gap between cognitive
<br>
neuroscience and the behavioral sciences, leading to a new way of
<br>
understanding human beings. Thus, we hope to find principles that will apply
<br>
equally well to androids and Homo sapiens.
<br>
<p>*Topics of interest*
<br>
- The role of affect and motivation in social development or communication
<br>
- Empathic relationships among people and/or robots
<br>
- Inter-species co-evolution, cooperation, and empathy
<br>
- Processes of socialization and enculturation
<br>
- Extended relationship
<br>
- Social learning and adaptation, especially from people
<br>
- The evolution, development, and nature of agency, intentionality, or
<br>
social intelligence
<br>
- Software architectures for embodied social interaction
<br>
- The grounding, emergence, or acquisition of communicative signs or symbols
<br>
- Mimesis and its role in communication and development
<br>
- The development or implementation of hierarchies of meaning
<br>
- Models of personal, interindividual, group, or cultural norms
<br>
- Cross-modal synchronization or stabilized plasticity in speech and/or
<br>
gesture
<br>
- Learning with and from machines
<br>
- Androids working alongside people as peers
<br>
- Applications in human environments
<br>
- Ethical issues concerning androids
<br>
- Perception of naturalness, attractiveness, or charisma
<br>
- The relationship between appearance and perceived behavior
<br>
- Android personalities
<br>
- Emotional intelligence
<br>
- The Total Turing Test
<br>
<p>*Target participants*
<br>
Robotics engineers and computer scientists with an interest in artificial
<br>
intelligence, machine learning, pattern recognition, and control, especially
<br>
those whose target platform includes humanoid robots; psychologists and
<br>
sociologists who are concerned with real-time embodied communication or
<br>
social development; cognitive scientists who are concerned with the
<br>
relationship between brain processes and social dynamics; social and
<br>
comparative biologists; and philosophers.
<br>
<p>The workshop is of interest to the target participants because androids will
<br>
provide a critical test bed for social and cognitive theories in the future,
<br>
and research in this domain depends on interdisciplinary collaboration
<br>
between engineers and natural and social scientists.
