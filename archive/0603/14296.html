<em>&gt; Have you seriously considered putting focused effort into proving that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practical self-modifying systems can *not* have predictably stable goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't recall specific discussion on that point.
</em><br>
<p>I often consider that problem; if I could prove the problem impossible 
<br>
in theory I would probably be quite close to solving it in practice.  My 
<br>
attention tends to focus on Godelian concerns, though I think of them as 
<br>
&quot;Lobian&quot; after Lob's Theorem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I strongly suspect that such a proof would be relatively simple. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Obviously, at this stage you don't agree with this sentiment).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturally the implication for SIAI (and the FAI/AGI community in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general) would be substantial.
</em><br>
<p>Please go right ahead and do it; don't let me stop you!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Any practical high-level AGI has to use its knowledge to interpret 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and question?) its given goals
</em><br>
<p>Any AGI must use its model of the real world to decide which real-world 
<br>
actions lead to which real-world consequences, and evaluate its utility 
<br>
function or other decision system against the model's predicted 
<br>
real-world consequences.
<br>
<p>This does *not* necessarily involve changing the utility function.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Such a system would gain improved knowledge from interactions with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real world. The content of this knowledge and conclusions reached by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI are not predictable.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - By the nature of its source of information, much knowledge would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on induction and/or statistics, and be inherently fallible.
</em><br>
<p>Also agreed.
<br>
<p>Please note however, that accidentally killing a human is not a 
<br>
catastrophic failure.  One evil deed does not turn the FAI evil, like a 
<br>
character in a bad movie.  *Catastrophic* failures, which change what 
<br>
the FAI is *trying* to do, require that the FAI fail on the task of 
<br>
recursive self-improvement.
<br>
<p>So an impossibility proof would have to say:
<br>
<p>1)  The AI cannot reproduce onto new hardware, or modify itself on 
<br>
current hardware, with knowable stability of the decision system (that 
<br>
which determines what the AI is *trying* to accomplish in the external 
<br>
world) and bounded low cumulative failure probability over many rounds 
<br>
of self-modification.
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p>2)  The AI's decision function (as it exists in abstract form across 
<br>
self-modifications) cannot be knowably stably bound with bounded low 
<br>
cumulative failure probability to programmer-targeted consequences as 
<br>
represented within the AI's changing, inductive world-model.
<br>
<p>If I could rigorously prove such an impossibility, my understanding 
<br>
would probably have advanced to the point where I could also go ahead 
<br>
and pull it off in practice.
<br>
