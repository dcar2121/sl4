<p>Abstract: We discuss views about whether the universe can be rationally 
<br>
comprehended, starting with Plato, then Leibniz, and then the views of 
<br>
some distinguished scientists of the previous century. Based on this, we 
<br>
defend the thesis that comprehension is compression, i.e., explaining 
<br>
many facts using few theoretical assumptions, and that a theory may be 
<br>
viewed as a computer program for calculating observations. This provides 
<br>
motivation for defining the complexity of something to be the size of 
<br>
the simplest theory for it, in other words, the size of the smallest 
<br>
program for calculating it. This is the central idea of algorithmic 
<br>
information theory (AIT), a field of theoretical computer science. Using 
<br>
the mathematical concept of program-size complexity, we exhibit 
<br>
irreducible mathematical facts, mathematical facts that cannot be 
<br>
demonstrated using any mathematical theory simpler than they are. It 
<br>
follows that the world of mathematical ideas has infinite complexity and 
<br>
is therefore not fully comprehensible, at least not in a static fashion. 
<br>
Whether the physical world has finite or infinite complexity remains to 
<br>
be seen. Current science believes that the world contains randomness, 
<br>
and is therefore also infinitely complex, but a deterministic universe 
<br>
that simulates randomness via pseudo-randomness is also a possibility, 
<br>
at least according to recent highly speculative work of S. Wolfram.
