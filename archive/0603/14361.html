Since this is getting semi-off-topic, thisis my last post on the issue...
<br>
Contains one brief sl4 relevant bit, which is a rehash.

<em>&gt;...  However if you look at the actual research that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been done into IQ testing it's solid.  Indeed in terms of various metrics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such as consistency of results
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I don't think there's any doubt about /self-consistency/.  But tests to
<br>
determine, say, the strength of a person's belief in their powers of
<br>
telekinesis (which, according to a believer acquaintance, is a vital
<br>
component of telekinesis abilitie) could have consistency of .99, and still
<br>
not be an objective measure of their actual telekinesis abilities.
<br>
<p>There is a lot of consistency amongst similarly weighted tests.  However,
<br>
tests that differently weigh different aspects do give inconsistent global
<br>
results.  F'rinstance, I think Spearman said that mathsy skills correspond
<br>
something like 4.5 times as strongly with global intelligence as do graphic
<br>
drawing skills.  However, tests covering a range of skills in other
<br>
creative-artsy fields (eg: sculpture) have a high correlation with drawing
<br>
skills.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the ability of the test scores to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict future performance in mentally demanding tasks (e.g. future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academic performance), IQ tests are THE most rigorously validated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and proven psychological tests that exist.
</em><br>
<p>Various social skills also have high correlations, and although I don't
<br>
know, I'd bet that some measures of various social skills would be strong
<br>
indicators of business performance.
<br>
<p>The skills needed for good performance on IQ tests are similar to the skills
<br>
needed for academic performance up to mid undergraduate level.  Ignoring the
<br>
&quot;intelligence&quot; aspect, it's no surprise that the results closely correlate.
<br>
<p>On something of a tangent, one of my favorite quotes about such IQ tests
<br>
comes from a summary of results table from a book written in the 50s (I read
<br>
it more than a decade ago, and it was mostly crap - then again, I was
<br>
looking for something very different)
<br>
<p>&quot;160+  You could probably write a better test than the one you were just
<br>
given&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They reliably measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something very important, there's really no doubt about it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  No argument from me, or probably the vast majority of psychologists.
<br>
<p>I think that it is appropriate to refer to what IQtests measure as being an
<br>
aspect of intelligence.
<br>
<p>**SL4-relevant bit**
<br>
<p>What I don't think that it is appropriate to say is that IQ tests measure
<br>
what could be accurately and objectively described as &quot;overall
<br>
intelligence&quot;.  More importantly, I don't think that IQ tests accurately
<br>
measure &quot;general intelligence&quot;.  There are too many specialty skills
<br>
(intelligences) that interfere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &lt;snip&gt;  Very few people have ever done or even seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a real IQ test.
</em><br>
<p>All too true
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The debate is whether or not what they measure should be called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;intelligence&quot;.
</em><br>
That's really my point.
<br>
<p>Even if we have a common stipulative definition of &quot;intelligence&quot;, it is
<br>
very difficult to determine whether a test is measuring that thing.
<br>
<p>Analogy:  Health.
<br>
<p>Many people have a concept of overall &quot;health&quot;.  Its components include
<br>
cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, lack of disease, life expectancy...
<br>
<p>You can measure those components, but it's difficult to measure &quot;health&quot;
<br>
overall.
<br>
Measuring cardiovascular fitness and lack of disease, and giving a number to
<br>
the combination is just a &quot;combination measure&quot;.  Is it really an objective
<br>
measure of health?  How can we determine what is an objective measure of
<br>
health except through those ... uh... &quot;partisan&quot; measures?
<br>
<p>How do you determine if the measure is measuring the _idealistic concept_
<br>
you want it to?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Something like 90% of the population believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they have an above average IQ...
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, and even if they admit they aren't the best academically, they often
<br>
think they've &quot;got it figured out&quot; - that they don't need those academic /
<br>
logic smarts, because they can figure out things that the brainiacs
<br>
obviously can't (eg: politics, morality...)
<br>
<p>One thing that I think contributes to this outlook is that there are smart
<br>
people who disagree.
<br>
<p>Which is perfectly sensible, but makes them /appear/ no &quot;better at figuring
<br>
it out&quot; than anyone else.
