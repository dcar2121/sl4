<p>Michael,
<br>
<p>You misunderstand where I was going with my comments:  I do, of course, 
<br>
agree that humans already have these abilities.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I can rephrase it and say that any Bayesian reasoning engine
<br>
needs some &quot;preprocessing&quot; and &quot;postprocessing&quot; apparatus in order to
<br>
function (see the shopping list for details).  My contention is that the
<br>
pre and post processing is so extensive and complex in the human
<br>
cognitive system that it dwarfs the role played by any Bayesian (or
<br>
other) reasoning engine.  AI researchers implicitly use their own p+pp 
<br>
to help the systems they create (or shield the systems from the need to 
<br>
use too much pp, by choosing appropriately constrained domains), thus 
<br>
making the systems seem smarter than they really are.
<br>
<p>To illustrate:  would you be able to pick, say, 20 examples from your 
<br>
own real life thinking, where Bayesian reasoning helped you perform a 
<br>
task, in domains like the following:
<br>
<p>- Producing speech in a party conversation
<br>
- Debugging a computer program
<br>
- Writing a paper for a conference
<br>
- Shopping down at the supermarket
<br>
- Driving your car to work
<br>
- Teaching some children about biology
<br>
- Cooking meals for your family
<br>
- Planning a vacation
<br>
- Having a vacation
<br>
- Planning this year's gardening project
<br>
- Fixing a household problem like a plumbing leak
<br>
- Choosing a trustworthy painter to paint your house
<br>
- Planning your finances
<br>
- Learning how to play a musical instrument
<br>
- Finding a partner
<br>
- Choosing Christmas presents for your relations
<br>
- Assessing the validity of a political claim made by someone
<br>
- Choosing a new house
<br>
- Trying to figure out how to get your child to practice the piano
<br>
- Learning how to ice skate
<br>
<p>In any of the examples that you generate, do you think that the Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning (and *not* the preprocessing and postprocessing) was where all 
<br>
the important work was done (and if you would say this, is it possible 
<br>
to give some convincing argument to back it up?)?
<br>
<p>My claim is that I have just set you an impossible task, because 
<br>
Bayesian reasoning does not play a significant role in most of the 
<br>
things that cognitive systems do, and even when it does kick in, what is 
<br>
often attributed to it is partially the work of the peripheral processes.
<br>
<p>By that account, teaching Daniel to do fabulously sophisticated Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning would avail him nothing if his ability to do the preprocessing 
<br>
was no better than your or mine.
<br>
<p>I agree that it can be useful in certain situations, and indispensible 
<br>
in certain other, even more specialized, circumstances.  It is just not 
<br>
the biggest thing that makes an intelligent system intelligent, and I 
<br>
see no reason to believe that it is *the* most significant next step in 
<br>
the evolution of intelligence.
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore
<br>
<p>P.S.  You need look no further than the SL4 List for examples of people 
<br>
who, professing that they make judgements using normative reasoning of 
<br>
the highest order, are nevertheless able to produce, on occasion, the 
<br>
most asinine, emotive, prejudice-driven statements about subjects they 
<br>
know little about.  I can say this only because I am privileged to be an 
<br>
expert, in a certain unnameable field, and have had deep theoretical and 
<br>
empirical experience in that field, so at the very least I know what I 
<br>
am talking about *there* .... and I have seen the aforementioned rubbish 
<br>
talked about that area, by people who claim to know better.
