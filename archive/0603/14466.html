<p>I don't know of a reliable central source of the information.
<br>
<p>Trend curves have a very long history of being unreliable.  They're just 
<br>
better than most other models when you don't understand the system being 
<br>
predicted.  Don't put much faith in the projections, and don't put ANY faith 
<br>
in the precise predictions.   Still... what are the alternatives?   Modelling 
<br>
is based on understanding the system being modelled.  Trend curves just 
<br>
require a simple variable which is CHOSEN to be observable.  (Accurate models 
<br>
usually require modelling changes of variables which are quite difficult to 
<br>
observe or understand.  And even then, models are ALWAYS 
<br>
oversimplifications.)
<br>
<p>You might look into the multitude of articles on &quot;Moore's Law&quot; (check Google).  
<br>
That's a pure trend curve based projection (if you don't work inside of Intel 
<br>
or AMD) that's proven quite successful in the past.
<br>
<p>What Kurtzweil does is collect together a bunch of trend curves, and presume 
<br>
that an ensemble of trend curves is more reliable than a single one, which 
<br>
may or may not be true, depending on the fluctuations in the underlying 
<br>
system.  Some changes will affect all of the trend curves simultaneously.  
<br>
(The classic example is a devastating war, but plague could also count.  If, 
<br>
e.g., H5N1 turned out to be much more deadly &amp; contagious than anyone 
<br>
predicted when it mutated, or if HIV mutated into a form passed by simple 
<br>
contagion, or...)   Also, just because the trend curve is proven wrong 
<br>
doesn't mean it's been slowed or stopped.  Unforeseen future discoveries 
<br>
might exert an equally strong force in the more sharply upwards directions.  
<br>
And there WILL be unforeseen future discoveries.
