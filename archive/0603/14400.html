There aren't any such game systems, YET. However, different threads may 
<br>
converge to provide a gaming platform that would be useful for AGI development 
<br>
in the next several years. Currently there are few indie projects which are 
<br>
pursueing socially intelligent agents from a few different angles, but we 
<br>
won't see anything resembling goal-seeking in game agents for at least two 
<br>
years, but more likely three or four.
<br>
<p>If you're interested in the emergence of such a platform, projects you should 
<br>
follow, in addition to Spore, are the Storytron project, which has simplistic 
<br>
AI agents networked by verbs in a logographic &quot;toy&quot; langauge, and another 
<br>
indie game called &quot;Her Majesty's Hackers&quot;, which is being done by one very 
<br>
intelligent guy (with a shock level of about SL3, though not a member of this 
<br>
list). HMH is particularly interesting because its agents are supposed to 
<br>
represent genuis researchers and be intentive in this regard, and are equipped 
<br>
with inference modules based on a simplified bayesian model.
<br>
<p>However, Ben makes a good point that applications intended to be sold to an 
<br>
entertainment market aren't where you're likely to find AGI potential, even 
<br>
with a few tweaks. AGIsim is much better for simple geometric pattern 
<br>
recognition and other needed building blocks for a symbolic reasoning system.
<br>
<p>But, by the end of the decade, a convergence of AGI and interactive software 
<br>
will be much easier to imagine and implement, and humble threads of 
<br>
development are already pushing in that direction, albiet from narrow AI 
<br>
implementations.

<em>&gt;What interests me about AGI is that it can become a recursive physics 
</em><br>
learner; potentially spitting out engineering blueprints that can solve many 
<br>
of our problems.  Are there any baby-AGI projects, AI projects or game 
<br>
environments that have the potential to model a recursive Philosophy learner?  
<br>
I'm not refering to game-theoric economics AIs that allocate scarce resources 
<br>
to maximize portfolios gains, or anything like that.  I guess the key is to 
<br>
for the AI to understand the &quot;neurology&quot; of a game-agent's goal systems.  And 
<br>
for the AGI to implement solutions that appeal to rearranging the game 
<br>
environment or modifying agent sensory stimulus, rather than tinkering with 
<br>
the &quot;hypothalamus&quot; of the agent's goal systems.  I'm not ready to invest the 
<br>
time in creating such an environment, but if there is already a game out there 
<br>
that can be tweaked a little, I'll contribute.
