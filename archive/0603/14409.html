<em>&gt;&gt; So most of cog sci is saying &quot;no big jumps to us, no big jumps from us&quot; except
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for the computer theory side, which says &quot;big jump to us, but no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conceivable jump from us without invoking infinite computation or precision&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right! This fits my belief. Consider the following sworn testimony of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abductee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;The Alien was working on a doctoral dissertation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     entitled &quot;A Human Can Understand Anything that I Can, Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     it Will Take Him a Lot Longer, and You Will Not Believe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Trouble He Has to Go Through&quot; (which, incidentally, happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to require only three symbols in written Alien language). He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     selected me for his guinea pig, and it took him 23,392 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to teach me that A proves B. It would have taken him longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     ---several centuries, he said---if I had not already been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     good at math. There were 318 major parts of the theorem, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     over four hundred thousand lemmas. Naturally, I don't pretend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to have it all &quot;in mind&quot; at the same time, but I vaguely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     remember that even back on Earth by the end of certain long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     math proofs I was kind of fuzzy about how the earlier parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     went. What was essential for my understanding the proof of B
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     was that I built up a set of notes that's pretty elaborate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     (to put it mildly). You can check it out: I was allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     bring all my notes back, and they take up nearly a third of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the surface area of Ceres.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;My Alien would have failed with a dog or a chimpanzee, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     matter how long he tried. That's because I, as a human, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the concept of chunking concepts abstractly. Thus in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     dissertation, my Alien proved that we humans are just barely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     on the right side of a complexity barrier that many stupider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Earth creatures haven't crossed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;(By the way, don't feel sorry for me! I had the time of my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Mainly, no doubt, due to the superb drugs and brain stimulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     freely provided.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would not find such a narrative implausible on *theoretical* grounds.
</em><br>
