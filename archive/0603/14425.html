<p>Good grief, I have to say that I couldn't disagree more!
<br>
<p>What exactly would be the result of teaching him to do applied Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning?  (And how do you justify your answer?)
<br>
<p>What would your intended result be?  What is the purpose?  That he would 
<br>
become a Superhuman intelligence, or that he would help to develop an AGI?
<br>
<p>Would you not have to decide on a set of goals to give him as he bacme a 
<br>
BDT system, to guide the reasoning processes?  And when you had decided 
<br>
what goal structure was appropriate, would you have any reason to 
<br>
believe that he could simply internalize and run your intended goal 
<br>
system without deviating from it?
<br>
<p>Does his ability to handle some types of math extend to an ability to 
<br>
keep a goal stack in his head?
<br>
<p>And do we know anything about/have any control over the semantics and 
<br>
the grounding mechanisms that he would use to connect his facts to the 
<br>
real world?
<br>
<p>The questions are almost unlimited:  they are the same questions one 
<br>
would ask of anyone who claimed that they could build an AGI using 
<br>
Bayesian reasoning and decision theory.  Since most of the questions 
<br>
have not been answered for a computer version of such a BDT system, and 
<br>
since severe doubts exist that such a system will ever actually work 
<br>
autonomously, I would expect the experiment to program a savant to be a 
<br>
BDT would be a failure also.
<br>
<p>If it were not for the fact that we are talking about a human being 
<br>
here, and not a computer, I would be interested to see the outcome of 
<br>
such an experiment.
<br>
<p>It feels a little uncomfortable to think of anyone seriously picking up 
<br>
the phone and trying to involve him in such a project unless he 
<br>
understood exactly what it was that he was getting into.
