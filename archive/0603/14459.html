<p>
Richard,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My claim is that I have just set you an impossible task, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian reasoning does not play a significant role in most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that cognitive systems do, and even when it does kick in, what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; often attributed to it is partially the work of the peripheral processes.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree with you on this point.  I think that probabilistic
<br>
inference does play a major role in most of the things that cognitive
<br>
systems do.
<br>
<p>I cannot prove that I'm right, but I just want to point out that you
<br>
have not proved you're right either!
<br>
<p>You have listed a bunch of tasks that we humans carry out without
<br>
consciously, reflectively feeling like we're carrying out
<br>
probabilistic inference.  But, so what?  Analogously: We don't feel
<br>
like we're carrying out windowed Fourier or wavelet transforms when we
<br>
see, yet neuroscience tells us that (from an objective, scientific
<br>
standpoint) we actually are.
<br>
<p>My hypothesis is that the neurodynamics underlying most cognition is
<br>
in effect carrying out a set of crude approximations to probabilistic
<br>
inference.  For instance Hebbian learning on cell assemblies can
<br>
easily be shown to constitute a crude approximation to probabilistic
<br>
deduction.  This is a speculative theory of neurodynamics but it's not
<br>
one that can be dismissed out of hand....
<br>
<p>I suggest that, by building AI systems explicitly founded on
<br>
probabilistic inference, we are making systems that do in a more exact
<br>
and effective way what the human brain sloppily tries to approximate!
<br>
<p>But, this does not mean that complex self-organization plays no role
<br>
in human or AI cognition, of course.  Because the rules of inference
<br>
don't tell you much, directly, about what hypotheses to generate or
<br>
what inference trajectories to follow.  These things can in principle
<br>
be carried out based on probabilistic inference, but I conjecture that
<br>
in human brains (and tractable near-term AGI's) they happen in other
<br>
ways, which do involve the complexity-oriented concepts you are
<br>
frequently talking about.
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
