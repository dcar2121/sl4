Armchair AGI won’t get you anywhere. Theory must be followed by practical 
<br>
work in order for a project to be successful. This is because the time you 
<br>
waste on a mistake grows exponentially the longer you work with it without 
<br>
correcting it. For instance, you may waste weeks or months on a mistake you 
<br>
could have corrected with just a week of practical testing. This effect is 
<br>
less apparent in straightforward projects where you know it will work and 
<br>
it’s just a mater of time. AGI coding is definitely *NOT* straightforward.
<br>
<p>Let me illustrate this with an analogy. Imagine you are walking on a road. 
<br>
It splits in two, and every side splits in two again. This goes on and on 
<br>
like a branching tree. If you move forward you can see your end goal better 
<br>
since you're closer. However, if you rush too much you might take wrong 
<br>
turns. There are also many paths that will kill you. And the longer you wait 
<br>
around without getting to your goal the more likely you are to die.
<br>
<p>What is the best way to get where you're going?
<br>
You can try to figure out the way by looking forward (mostly theorize) but 
<br>
the farther you try to look the more difficult it will be to see. And so, no 
<br>
mater how hard you try, there will inevitably be mistakes. If you moved one 
<br>
step forward you will have a slightly better view and could have corrected 
<br>
the mistake instead of wasting all that time thinking about the wrong part 
<br>
of the maze.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if try to move too much without looking, you will 
<br>
inevitably take wrong turns and waste your time backtracking or worse, take 
<br>
a tern that kills you. (Although, I don't consider it very likely for those 
<br>
who just dabble without any theory to get anywhere. UFAI is many orders of 
<br>
magnitude smaller than the program simply not working. And FAI is many 
<br>
orders of magnitude smaller than FAI is.)
<br>
<p>The optimal approach is some combination of looking (theory) and moving 
<br>
(practice). You should try to look far ahead to get a general idea of the 
<br>
land, then take a step forward. Then look again, and so on. Because of the 
<br>
potentially precarious nature of the trip, you should examine the step in 
<br>
front of you very carefully, especially when you're close to the goal since 
<br>
that’s where the death turns are clustered.
<br>
<p>The fear of death paths should *NOT* paralyze you into just looking and 
<br>
never moving because the longer you wait, the more likely you are to succumb 
<br>
to an existential risk.
