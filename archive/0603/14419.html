Pretty neat stuff.
<br>
<p>&quot;Daniel claims that since the age of four, he has been able to do huge 
<br>
mathematical calculations in his head. So the makers of this documentary put 
<br>
him to the test, asking him to calculate 37 raised to the power of 4. He 
<br>
completed this in less than a minute, giving the correct answer of 
<br>
1,874,161&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Next he was asked to divide 13 by 97. This time the researchers had the 
<br>
answer to 32 decimal places&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;He is very gifted with words and speaks nine languages and claims to be 
<br>
able to learn a new one in just seven days.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Daniel had his own surprise, in Oxford, England, he would recite the number 
<br>
Pi to 22,500 decimal places, in public in front of a team of invigilators to 
<br>
verify his accuracy&quot;

<p>Also,
<br>
<p>&quot;Kim has a double photographic memory and can recall everything he has ever 
<br>
read. He speed reads by scanning opposing pages at the same time, one page 
<br>
with each eye. &quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Orlando Serrill was just 10 years old when he was hit, hard, on the side of 
<br>
the head by a baseball. Since when, he has been able to recall the day, date 
<br>
and weather of every day since the accident. &quot;
