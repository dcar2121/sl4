</em><br>
<p>Oh come now, it wasn't an emotional reaction, and the answers are not in 
<br>
the least bit obvious!
<br>
<p>Michael's suggestion did not seem to be about &quot;I wonder what would 
<br>
happen if he learned reasoning?&quot;  He said &quot;it would be SL4 if... &quot; and 
<br>
took it from there.  Not sure how else to interpret that comment except 
<br>
the way I did.  Michael could clarify, perhaps.  It seemed as though he 
<br>
was saying Daniel could be valuable to SL4 causes if he could be 
<br>
enhanced with Bayesian powers.
<br>
<p>On reflection, and being as self-deprecating as I am able (;-)) I guess 
<br>
I might have completely misunderstood Michael's intention to &quot;use&quot; 
<br>
Daniel to make a supergenius who could help solve some SL4 issues ... if 
<br>
so, sorry Michael!
<br>
<p>But that would still leave intact my criticisms of the usefulness (to 
<br>
Daniel) of making him into a super Bayesian reasoner.
<br>
<p>If someone is going to do lots of Bayesian reasoning and as a result 
<br>
push back the frontiers of knowledge, they need:
<br>
<p>1) solid ways to relate concepts to actual things in the world without 
<br>
someone helping them with the mapping (the semantics of the tokens)
<br>
<p>2) good techniques for creating new concepts about the world (some of 
<br>
which are going to be very subtle), as a result of gathering empirical 
<br>
experience of the world.
<br>
<p>3) solid data about prior probabilities of at least something (and 
<br>
justification for why the numbers *are* solid, of course)
<br>
<p>4) ways to represent subtle questions and statements about real world 
<br>
situations in such a format that a Bayesian reasoning system could 
<br>
actually do something sensible with them (for example, answering 
<br>
questions about abstract analogies)
<br>
<p>Inasmuch as Michael was suggesting that Daniel's existing genius could 
<br>
be combined with a fabulous Bayesian reasoning ability to yield 
<br>
something truly superlative and useful (and if that was not what Michael 
<br>
intended, I stand corrected of course), then I am disagreeing and saying 
<br>
that:
<br>
<p>a) Daniel would not necessarily be any better than the rest of us in 
<br>
these respects, and
<br>
<p>b) In fact, given our understanding of other savants, we might expect 
<br>
him to be somewhat worse (I hesitate to generalize, because all cases 
<br>
are unique), and
<br>
<p>c) The performance of a Bayesian reasoner is crucially dependent on 
<br>
these peripheral factors.
<br>
<p><p><p>My shopping list of issues is, as you know, the same shopping list of 
<br>
unsolved problems that can be laid at the door of anyone trying to build 
<br>
an AGI that is predominantly based on Bayesian reasoning.
<br>
<p>And my critique is quite general in one other respect:  it can be 
<br>
applied just as easily to the frequent comments on this list by people 
<br>
who imply that Bayesian reasoning is in some sense the highest form of 
<br>
human thought.  Something more than just a useful tool under some 
<br>
circumstances, at least for people who are already modestly competent at 
<br>
general purpose reasoning.
<br>
<p>Ordinary brain + fabulous competence in Bayesian mathematics = something 
<br>
that depends on how that brain does all the work of building new 
<br>
symbols, mapping symbols to real things in the world, interpreting real 
<br>
issues into representations that mean something to the Bayesian module, 
<br>
etc etc etc (the shopping list) .... and if all this apparatus is just 
<br>
feeding the Bayesian module heaps of low quality data, then heaps of low 
<br>
quality conclusions are what you get out the other end.
<br>
<p><p>In summary, I don't think you can say that it is *obvious* how the above 
<br>
problems would be addressed by someone who went in there to teach Daniel 
<br>
Bayesian reasoning.
