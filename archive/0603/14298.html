I basically agree.  You can learn a phenominal amount by trying at something 
<br>
and failing.  There needs to be a balance between theory and practice, but 
<br>
people have a tendency to over-theorize.

<em>&gt;Subject: Too much talk not enough action
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Date: Sat, 04 Mar 2006 18:44:54 +0000

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Armchair AGI won’t get you anywhere. Theory must be followed by practical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work in order for a project to be successful. This is because the time you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;waste on a mistake grows exponentially the longer you work with it without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correcting it. For instance, you may waste weeks or months on a mistake you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could have corrected with just a week of practical testing. This effect is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less apparent in straightforward projects where you know it will work and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it’s just a mater of time. AGI coding is definitely *NOT* straightforward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me illustrate this with an analogy. Imagine you are walking on a road. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It splits in two, and every side splits in two again. This goes on and on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like a branching tree. If you move forward you can see your end goal better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since you're closer. However, if you rush too much you might take wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turns. There are also many paths that will kill you. And the longer you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wait around without getting to your goal the more likely you are to die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What is the best way to get where you're going?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You can try to figure out the way by looking forward (mostly theorize) but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the farther you try to look the more difficult it will be to see. And so, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no mater how hard you try, there will inevitably be mistakes. If you moved 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one step forward you will have a slightly better view and could have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corrected the mistake instead of wasting all that time thinking about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong part of the maze.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On the other hand, if try to move too much without looking, you will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inevitably take wrong turns and waste your time backtracking or worse, take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a tern that kills you. (Although, I don't consider it very likely for those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who just dabble without any theory to get anywhere. UFAI is many orders of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;magnitude smaller than the program simply not working. And FAI is many 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;orders of magnitude smaller than FAI is.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The optimal approach is some combination of looking (theory) and moving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(practice). You should try to look far ahead to get a general idea of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;land, then take a step forward. Then look again, and so on. Because of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;potentially precarious nature of the trip, you should examine the step in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;front of you very carefully, especially when you're close to the goal since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that’s where the death turns are clustered.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The fear of death paths should *NOT* paralyze you into just looking and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;never moving because the longer you wait, the more likely you are to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;succumb to an existential risk.
