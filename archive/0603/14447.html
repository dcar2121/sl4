<p>
I need to add, before misunderstandings go any further, that the final 
<br>
postscriptum in my last post was not IN ANY WAY directed at Michael Vassar.
<br>
<p>[And I stand by what I said (the word &quot;asinine&quot; was perhaps a little 
<br>
strong, but I would argue that it was appropriate).  The overall comment 
<br>
was not rude or offensive, it was an observation, and it is an important 
<br>
facet of the posts that have appeared on this list, entirely relevant to 
<br>
discussions about normative reasoning, Bayesian inference and 
<br>
rationality.  If anyone would like to see the posts in question, and see 
<br>
my analysis of them, so we can debate whether the hypocrisy I referred 
<br>
to has indeed been happening, please let me know.]
<br>
<p><p>More generally:
<br>
<p>Would people please STOP assuming that everything I write is emotional 
<br>
and angry .... I have had several comments come out of the blue in the 
<br>
last few months, asking me to be less emotional in situations where I 
<br>
have shown no emotion or anger.  I find myself completely bemused by 
<br>
these comments!
<br>
<p>I can only assume that this stems from the ONE incident last year when, 
<br>
under extreme provocation, I responded to a very deliberate, unambiguous 
<br>
set of offensive insults by writing back in kind.  Somehow, as a result 
<br>
of this one incident, people have started to associate any words that I 
<br>
write as coming from an angry keyboard.  Simply not true.
<br>
<p>Look again at anything I have written, and see if it is possible to 
<br>
imagine it written dispassionately, by someone who doesn't hesitate to 
<br>
say that he disagrees when he does disagree, but who then argues his 
<br>
case without being personal or angry.  If you find that it is possible 
<br>
to read my messages as if they came from such a neutral person, then 
<br>
believe me THAT IS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WROTE THEM.
<br>
