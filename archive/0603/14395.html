</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not bad for a kilo of wetware. Also, our acts of memory are often de facto

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thursday as a method of retrieval. In addition, we often 'fill in' our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories with plausible fabrications presumably as a data compression or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space saving device. Apart from that we have various daydreams and 'what-if'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios we habitually play out. Indeed, one might argue that the hallmark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of intelligence is such scenarios.
</em><br>
<p>I really like that explanation!  I don't think I've thought of it or
<br>
heard it described before.  I disagree with your conclusions, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Anyway, if this is what's happening it does suggest that the Being who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing all this has certain likely features. These are:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a) It uses data compression and/or is running a maximally efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reversible computing algorithm.
</em><br>
<p>???  One would assume that, being smart, it is using data compression.
<br>
&nbsp;But nothing you have said suggests that it is, or that it is running
<br>
a reversible computer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  b) It may be using a QC-like structure to simulate what-ifs as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proliferating branches.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  c) A Jupiter brain has an inevitably fragmented personality given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lightspeed restrictions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  d) It's recalling the events leading up to a Human created Singularity, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filling in the gaps. We are here because of the historical record.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  e) The Singularity (from our POV) is the end of the process.
</em><br>
<p>I see no implications of these items.  The idea that we are a
<br>
&quot;simulation&quot; being recreated merely as part of the thought-process of
<br>
some entity has no relationship to items a-e.
