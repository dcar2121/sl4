<p>
I'm rather fond of the Simulation Argument (SA) not least because it seems
<br>
the only hypothesis that neatly resolves the Fermi Paradox. However, there
<br>
is inevitably a question as to what this Sim is all about. So, allow me to
<br>
make a suggestion, and I would be pleased if someone could point me to
<br>
previous such discussion.
<br>
<p>Given the SA then the Singularity has for all intents and purposes come and
<br>
gone, somewhere, and we did not preceed it.
<br>
<p>This is something of a very brief condensation of my writings elsewhere, but
<br>
essentially this Sim is a *dream* or an act of memory retrieval. In our own
<br>
dreams we simulate realities quite convincingly most of the time, and people
<br>
them with entities often quite capable of passing the Turing Test. Not bad
<br>
for a kilo of wetware. Also, our acts of memory are often de facto
<br>
simulations. For example, a question of &quot;what did you do last Thursday&quot; will
<br>
elicit in most people a brief re-run of the events leading up to and into
<br>
Thursday as a method of retrieval. In addition, we often 'fill in' our
<br>
memories with plausible fabrications presumably as a data compression or
<br>
space saving device. Apart from that we have various daydreams and 'what-if'
<br>
scenarios we habitually play out. Indeed, one might argue that the hallmark
<br>
of intelligence is such scenarios.
<br>
<p>Anyway, if this is what's happening it does suggest that the Being who is
<br>
doing all this has certain likely features. These are:
<br>
a) It uses data compression and/or is running a maximally efficient
<br>
reversible computing algorithm.
<br>
b) It may be using a QC-like structure to simulate what-ifs as proliferating
<br>
branches.
<br>
c) A Jupiter brain has an inevitably fragmented personality given lightspeed
<br>
restrictions.
<br>
d) It's recalling the events leading up to a Human created Singularity, and
<br>
filling in the gaps. We are here because of the historical record.
<br>
e) The Singularity (from our POV) is the end of the process.
<br>
<p>There are a few other implications, but these are presumably off-topic for
<br>
this list.
<br>
<p>Dirk
