<p><p>More like 1-15 exaflops.
<br>
<p>&lt;But here it says we do only 22.8 teraflops, I mean since the computer is
<br>
<em>&gt; running in &quot;real time&quot;, that would clock us &lt;at 22.8 teraflops yes?
</em><br>
<p><p>No, that's only a tiny fragment of a brain they're doing, and not all the
<br>
functionality of even those few neurons at that.
<br>
<p>Functional replication of the functionality of early auditory processing
<br>
<em>&gt; (which is quite well understood) has yielded an estimate that agrees with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moravec's assessment based on signal processing in the retina (i.e. 10^14
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ops &lt;for whole-brain equivalent replication).
</em><br>
<p><p>It's highly questionable whether that scales to the whole brain, and it
<br>
doesn't take into account full (rather than instantaneous) functionality.
<br>
<p>But the brain probably does something like 10^18 - 10^19 flops using
<br>
algorithms designed to exploit the strengths of neural hardware. If you look
<br>
at how the 10^14 estimate was derived, it's what would be required to
<br>
produce similar capability using algorithms designed to exploit the
<br>
strengths of von Neumann hardware; and for that, it might be a plausible
<br>
guess. So we have:
<br>
<p>A: 10^18 - 10^19 flops (rough estimate) to run an upload.
<br>
B: 10^14 flops (very rough estimate) to run a complete, highly optimized AI.
<br>
C: ? flops (no data) to create an AI.
<br>
<p>I am thinking either an upload would be very very dangerous or very very
<br>
<em>&gt; safe. I cannot see how there would be a wishy washy upload unless it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrectly instantiated or kept on the equivalent of AI sedatives all day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In fiction that would likely be true; the upload would either be a hero, in
<br>
which case all his actions would be for good, or a villain, in which case
<br>
all his actions would be for bad; either way, everything he did would work
<br>
as planned unless thwarted by his opposite number.
<br>
<p>In reality an upload will be restricted, like the rest of us, by the
<br>
unpredictability of the world; he'll have advantages (potential immortality)
<br>
and disadvantages (likely slower thinking speed (computers have lower ratios
<br>
of internal bandwidth to memory than brains) and uncertain legal status, at
<br>
least for awhile - the second mightn't sound so important until you think
<br>
about how many restrictions it would put on what you could practically do);
<br>
as usual, I expect real life to be a lot more complicated than fiction.
