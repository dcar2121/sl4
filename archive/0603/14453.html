I think it's good to simply not respond to emotional posts.
<br>
I think it's also good to not respond to posts emotionally.
<br>
<p>qualifiers:
<br>
good = a subjective measure of positive or negative reinforcement for
<br>
behavior
<br>
emotional posts = those which the reader suspects were written by a
<br>
defensively reactive author
<br>
respond emotionally = allowing the reader's beliefs to obscure the writer's
<br>
intended point
<br>
it's = a contraction of &quot;it&quot; and &quot;is&quot;; effectively a declaration of supposed
<br>
state
<br>
I think = a dubious assertion in any context
<br>
<p>If all two sentence posts required this kind of qualification, more
<br>
substantial discussion would be so tedious as to be completely unreadable.
<br>
<p>aside to Richard - I don't think you write any more or less emotionally than
<br>
anyone else.  You may fugue a bit more on the consequences than I do...  I
<br>
feel it would be more of a &quot;serious social problem&quot; for the reader if an
<br>
email to this list would cause a negative emotional response.
<br>
<p>I thought to add META to this subject line, but did not want to cause
<br>
another thread to start in threaded mail readers.
<br>
<p>&quot;I have to laugh at myself, because laughing at everyone else is considered
<br>
impolite&quot;  -me

<em>&gt; Ah, you may need to be a little careful, yourself, about those tricky

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Was it actually appropriate?  Well, in this case, where I was referring

</em><br>

</em><br>
