Finally someone on this list is talking sense! Yes, if you combined the Havok 
<br>
physics engine with Spore, and maybe a evolutionary algorithm like the memetic 
<br>
algorithm (I believe Spore's evolutionary algorithms neglect the 
<br>
hueristic-driven local search component), it's possible to have AI to a 
<br>
limited capacity. I can't say with certianty whether this AI would be 
<br>
integrated and well-rounded enough to be called &quot;general&quot;, but I can say with 
<br>
a great deal of faith that AGI and interactive entertianment applications will 
<br>
converge, possibly by the middle of the next decade.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the list has been a little quiet for a couple of days, so I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd gag up something I've been mulling over for a while...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm thinking it might be possible to develop evolving in-game
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lifeforms of trivial general intelligence. and I think that the code
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is not only possible today, but that it's already here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;let me explain my basis in contrast to the kurzweil/moravec notion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replacing existing brain elements with inorganic equivalents to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produce a thinking being - with the contrast being that I see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;moravec approach as being top-down, while I believe there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinct possibility of a bottom-up path-to-intelligence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two more elements are needed for this position: evolution and reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt;engineering. of course the validity of a moravec-mind is needed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well, but let's just make than an assumption for this case that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(and I'm sure has) be discussed at length in other threads.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;start with an immersive 3D gameworld with a simulation engine running
</em><br>
<em>&gt;newtonian physics and genetic biology. there must be hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;running codebases today that could be merged to provide this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then, you reverse engineer the properties of an amoeba. you define
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's sequenced genome in logic, and you assign these properties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abilities to in-game programmed objects, and then you let them loose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in a newtonian phyics based simworld with elements, seasons, sunlight
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and resources. Remember that much of existing science, and physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;especially, is just reverse engineering; gravity existed long before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we named it so, as did carbon. We now have a very, very complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding of the sub-cosmic and super-quantum realms; more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough to replicate organic existence with incredible realism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;now we know all the answers to how this world should behave, and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this ameoba should develop, as it's already happened in our past; we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a perfect history of it all preserved for comparison. if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world starts to diverge markedly, you can tweak the ratios that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;determine random changes via scarcity of resources, overpopulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;climate change etc that drive evolutionary development. you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;program the basic imperatives of an amoeba; feed, grow, compete,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survive, divide. yes, the simulation is more complex than my basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;examples. but I think rigorous apllication of attention to detail
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could overcome any inconsistencies or incompleteness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if you build on this, again and again, in painstaking detail, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;should eventually get to something substantial. how many data points
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are required to map the complete genetic evolutionary development from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an ameoba to a fieldmouse? alot? sure. an infinite amount? no. we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those records, preserved for posterity in thin layers of earth; we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trace every step, and then provide a mirror environment to reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it. and if we can get from ameoba-like to mouse-like satisfactorily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can we then progress our bottom-up approach from mouse-like to, well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dog-like? monkey-like? man-like? you tell me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if this is all sounding too outlandish or complex to simulate at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technical level, there's a another 80's tech staple thats coming out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if it's own winter to help out: Procedural Generation (PG). This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how the gameworld terrains of 80's titles generated their in-game
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enivronments when gig's of animations on a dvd weren't an option. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;procedural approach says you don't have to create a world by hand; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just set up the rules, press go, and let the world generate itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is also the technique used by demoscene developers; check out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what 64k(!) of procedural generation can do here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://awards.scene.org/nominees.php?cat=9">http://awards.scene.org/nominees.php?cat=9</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wil Wright is the gaming legend is currently championing this, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Spore is the game due out this year which is currently knocking my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socks off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the first third of this video is a must-watch:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;q=spore">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;q=spore</a></em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and a writeup of the game (and PG) is here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(game">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(game</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wright isn't just using PG for textures or tiles; he's also using it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for biomechanics and evolutionary characteristics like swimming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;walking, hunting, killing, eating and mating. None of the in-game
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creatures in Spore are modelled prior to installing the game. every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;single one evolves using an array of possible physical development
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paths to come to life as completely unique organisms that execute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;motile ability in a completely (un)natural way. If you haven't watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the video linked above, I'd recommend doing so now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now the interesting part to all this is that when playing Spore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you'll be competing against AI-generated evolving orgranisms; and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think if the simulation is realistic enough, and the properties of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organisms detailed enough, then we'll be starting to enter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;god-mode lobby of the SA you lot have been fascinated with lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It seems more and more that if we use sufficently comprehensive narrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simulations of our in-historic-light-cone world that we can create
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glimpes of real intelligence in our simulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are growing examples of in-game AI generating AGI-like eruptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of higher-intelligence-like behaviour. One the recent (elder scrolls
</em><br>
<em>&gt;iv?) mmorpg games had testers walk into a in-game-evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;previously-unvisited villiage where none of the townspeople would let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them in. turns out the villiage guards had gotten drunk and gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hunting and gotten lost, and then bandits had raided the villiage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each narrow-AI indivdiual guard|bandit|townsperson had combined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generate an effect more like that which could be envisioned by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher intellect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there's also this older example from 2001:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;This ability to discriminate has already produced some real surprises
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for testers and creators alike during development. In one situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there was a creature that kept losing a stone-throwing game to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creature. To get revenge, the first creature heated a rock, planted it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the pile of stones to be thrown and then fell on the floor laughing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when its rival burned its hands. All this happened without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intervention from the player.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;- <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237848.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237848.stm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The next-gen consoles with their Cell processors are supposedly ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the 'Procedural Syntheisis' needed to implement Procedural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Generation - does this mean the next glimmer of basic AGI will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the living room instead of the lab?
