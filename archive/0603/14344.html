Simulation or whatever.
<br>
<p>We can suppose our universe (reality, whatever) to bear the same
<br>
relation to ourselves as a simulation might bear to a simulated
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>This is a reasonable abstraction.
<br>
<p>However, we can't really know anything concrete about that. It can never
<br>
be more than speculation, because it's invalid to make an inference from
<br>
an unknown. By definition, that which is outside of our universe is
<br>
unknown, and that which is known is inside of our universe.
<br>
<p>The computer simulation suggestion supposes &quot;that which is outside of
<br>
our universe&quot; to be essentially the same as &quot;that which is inside of our
<br>
universe&quot;. This is inherent in the idea of of a computer, which is an
<br>
embodied mechanism functioning according to logics which only apply in
<br>
our universe.
<br>
<p>If you want to take simulation less literally, and suppose our universe
<br>
to be merely contained by a super-container, then that's not
<br>
philosophically unreasonable. However, we can't make inferences about
<br>
the specific nature of that container.
<br>
<p>As Wittgenstein puts it, to know the limits of something implies knowing
<br>
what both sides of the limit are. One can never truly know what it's
<br>
like to be in a box, if one does not know what's outside of a box.
<br>
(because one will fail to properly understand what is meant by a box).
<br>
<p>One can only imagine &quot;containedness&quot;, not the nature of that
<br>
containedness.
<br>
<p>However, it's possible that we are contained, and in the concept
<br>
containedness exists the possibility for escape. We might not need to
<br>
know the true nature of our container in order to get out of it. Or
<br>
there might be a leak.
<br>
<p>Ack, sorry for rambling and being a bit quick and easy with this email.
<br>
I'm at work and in a rush.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
