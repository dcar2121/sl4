Ah, you may need to be a little careful, yourself, about those tricky 
<br>
universal quantifiers ;-), as in my phrase &quot;please STOP assuming that 
<br>
*everything* I write is emotional....&quot;
<br>
<p>This is different from &quot;please DO assume that everything I write is NOT 
<br>
emotional&quot;.
<br>
<p>The word *everything*, in the original, allows me to say that I am 
<br>
unemotional 99% of the time, whilst at the same time reserving the right 
<br>
to emphasize one small point with a carefully chosen emotive word when 
<br>
it is appropriate.
<br>
<p>Was it actually appropriate?  Well, in this case, where I was referring 
<br>
to unjustified emotional behavior in *someone* *else* (one single 
<br>
individual), the context makes it fairly reasonable to describe that 
<br>
person's behavior as &quot;asinine&quot;.
<br>
<p>I doubt that it is evidence of a &quot;serious social problem&quot; on my part.
<br>
<p>[That said, I have just written about a possible misunderstanding of my 
<br>
comment.]
