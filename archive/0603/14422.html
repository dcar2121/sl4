<p>Savantness isn't a binary, nor is it always lowest level
<br>
rote memorization/sensing. I have exceptional abilities
<br>
when it comes to programming, and when it comes to
<br>
memory of scientific/technical ideas. This comes at a cost
<br>
however, my memory for data like phone #s, names, spelling 
<br>
of words, etc. is very poor. I spell from muscle memory
<br>
when typing, ask me how these words are spelled verbally
<br>
and it would be a challenge if not impossible to spell them
<br>
verbally.
<br>
<p>My guess is the reason why autism and savant like abilities
<br>
often come together is that autism results in unusual allocations
<br>
of brain matter to various tasks. Some tasks getting much more
<br>
than usual and some less. The question is what came first? The
<br>
allocation of brain matter, or does exceptional interest in
<br>
something (common in autism) basically recruit large amounts of
<br>
brain matter to that use?
<br>
<p>It is relevant to AI in the sense that specialist AIs may not
<br>
need to have full human brain power to show exceptional abilities.
<br>
For example a theoritical math AI might not have to be that large
<br>
to excel.
