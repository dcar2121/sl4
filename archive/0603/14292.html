<em>&gt; IRT &quot;It seems to me everyone is making a mistake in thinking that checking
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; halts.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --- Actually, I don't think that this is a mistake.  We are attempting to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the idea as a possible way of maintaining goal stability through recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self improvement.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and I am saying you should try to verify something about the
<br>
outputs of the AI, not something about its entire internal operations.
<br>
<p>Consider program verification, which is a similar problem.  Any
<br>
attempt to formally verify that everything a program does matches the
<br>
programmer's intentions ends up amounting to re-writing the program in
<br>
predicate logic.  (If you really want to verify your program, just
<br>
write it in Prolog to begin with.)  What people actually do is to
<br>
isolate blocks of code, and tag them with statements that say, &quot;If
<br>
conditions X are met on entering this block, then conditions Y are met
<br>
on exiting this block.&quot;  This is like what I was saying (isolate the
<br>
actions/outputs, and then test them according to your rules), and not
<br>
at all like proving whether a program halts.  Any post (other than
<br>
this one :) that references the halting problem or Rice's theorem is
<br>
off the mark.
<br>
<p>In laymen's terms, I'm talking about something more like the Three
<br>
Rules of Robotics.  These are a post-processing system which takes
<br>
whatever it is the robot proposed to do, runs it by the Three Rules,
<br>
and rejects it if it fails them.
<br>
<p>(I will laugh and laugh and then cry if nobody can come up with any
<br>
system for Friendliness better than the Three Rules.  No challengers
<br>
so far.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IRT &quot;I think there is absolutely no hope of being able to formally verify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything about the results of a proposed course of action in the world.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --- As a bare statement, I would have to agree with you.  However, it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the verification of the results of a proposed course of action that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intend to verify.  Rather it is the whether the *intended* results of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action are Friendly, and provably so based on the definition of Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as reified in the AI system and its goals.  Where the intended and actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results differ the AI has failed to accurately predict outcomes, and this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; salient for learning.
</em><br>
<p>Why ask about the *intended* results?  The intended results are
<br>
1) Of less significance than the *actual* results.
<br>
2) Orders of magnitude more difficult to establish than the *actual* results.
