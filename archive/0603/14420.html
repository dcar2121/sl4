These kinds of feats are suprisingly common. They are usually specific
<br>
abilities which do not translate into their general IQ.
<br>
<p>One article on a savant of this kind had him discussing the process. It
<br>
was more like a process that he didn't find difficult than anything
<br>
else. It seems that some people are able to engage their visual
<br>
processing in other areas -- such as people with synaesthesia. There are
<br>
also plenty of Autistic savants around.
<br>
<p>This kind of thing isn't sl4 to me. Interesting, but not I think holding
<br>
great promise for AI research.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
