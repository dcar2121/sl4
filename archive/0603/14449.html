In my previous comment:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; P.S.  You need look no further than the SL4 List for examples of people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who, professing that they make judgements using normative reasoning of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the highest order, are nevertheless able to produce, on occasion, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most asinine, emotive, prejudice-driven statements about subjects they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know little about.  I can say this only because I am privileged to be an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expert, in a certain unnameable field, and have had deep theoretical and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empirical experience in that field, so at the very least I know what I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am talking about *there* .... and I have seen the aforementioned rubbish 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talked about that area, by people who claim to know better.
</em><br>
<p>I meant to imply you can find SOME people ..... like one or two or 
<br>
three, depending on who is still around.
<br>
<p>The word &quot;people&quot; was being used in pretty much SINGULAR NEUTRAL sense: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;euphemism for person!
<br>
<p>God forbid that anyone went for the worst interpretation of the above 
<br>
comment and thought that I mean &quot;people&quot; as in &quot;most of the people on 
<br>
this list&quot;!!!!
<br>
<p><p>This is what I mean by being assumed to be writing angry comments: 
<br>
someone might have to have their defaults set to Loosemore-Comments = 
<br>
Always Angry Comments, in order to imagine I would say such a thing 
<br>
about everyone, or most of the people, on this list.
<br>
<p>I was talking about a small minority.
<br>
