<p>
This book was only just published in 2005. I wonder if this will start to 
<br>
wittle away at the popular &quot;aversion&quot; to Strong AI. Fortunately for me, I 
<br>
stumbled upon this book in the science library.
<br>
<p>I've spent a good 3 or 4 hours reading this book and I'm only on page 5, so, 
<br>
yeah, it's really thought provoking material.
<br>
<p><p>&quot; New discoveries about algorithms are leading scientists beyond the 
<br>
Church-Turing Thesis, which governs the &quot;algorithmic universe&quot; and asserts 
<br>
the conventionality of recursive algorithms. A new paradigm for computation, 
<br>
the super-recursive algorithm, offers promising prospects for algorithms of 
<br>
much greater computing power and efficiency. Super-Recursive Algorithms 
<br>
provides an accessible, focused examination of the theory of super-recursive 
<br>
algorithms and its ramifications for the computer industry, networks, 
<br>
artificial intelligence, embedded systems, and the Internet. The book 
<br>
demonstrates how these algorithms are more appropriate as mathematical 
<br>
models for modern computers, and how these algorithms present a better 
<br>
framework for computing methods in such areas as numerical analysis, array 
<br>
searching, and controlling and monitoring systems. Problems of software 
<br>
development, parallel and distributed processing, pervasive and emerging 
<br>
computation, computer architecture, machine learning, brain modeling, 
<br>
knowledge discovery, and intelligent systems are addressed. Topics and 
<br>
Features: * Encompasses and systematizes all main classes of super-recursive 
<br>
algorithms and the theory behind them * Describes the strengthening link 
<br>
between the theory of super-recursive algorithms and actual algorithms close 
<br>
to practical realization * Examines the theory’s basis as a foundation for 
<br>
advancements in computing, information science, and related technologies * 
<br>
Highlights how super-recursive algorithms pave the way for more advanced 
<br>
design, utilization, and maintenance of computers * Possesses a 
<br>
comprehensive bibliography and index This clear exposition, motivated by 
<br>
numerous examples and illustrations, serves to develop a new paradigm for 
<br>
complex, high-performance computing based on both partial recursive 
<br>
functions and more inclusive recursive algorithms. Researchers and advanced 
<br>
students interested in theory of computation and algorithms will find the 
<br>
book an essential resource for an important new class of algorithms. &quot;
