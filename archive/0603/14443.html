<em>&gt;What exactly would be the result of teaching him to do applied Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasoning?    That he would become a Superhuman intelligence, or that he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would help to develop an AGI?
</em><br>
<p>Well, &quot;super&quot; is one of those adjectives that describes a trait that recedes 
<br>
as approached.  I wouldn't bother talking to anyone who wasn't runing mental 
<br>
software that makes them &quot;super&quot; relative to a &quot;natural&quot; hairless ape who 
<br>
was not running such software.  From the perspective of contemporary human 
<br>
rationalists with human values the point of almost any rationally applied 
<br>
intelligence is to develop FAI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Would you not have to decide on a set of goals to give him as he bacme a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;BDT system, to guide the reasoning processes?
</em><br>
<p>We don't have technology to install goals into a human, but humans come 
<br>
equipped with goals other than paperclip maximization.  A human who 
<br>
implemented BDT rapidly and accurately would still be a far cry from a 
<br>
simple BDT system.  They would basically be a less defective new kind of 
<br>
human.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does his ability to handle some types of math extend to an ability to keep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a goal stack in his head?
</em><br>
<p>No idea.  I think most humans can do that reasonably well with a little 
<br>
practice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And do we know anything about/have any control over the semantics and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grounding mechanisms that he would use to connect his facts to the real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world?
</em><br>
<p>Is this different from with any other human?  The &quot;grounding methods&quot; are 
<br>
already in place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If it were not for the fact that we are talking about a human being here, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and not a computer, I would be interested to see the outcome of such an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Do you usually consider teaching people things to be human experimentation 
<br>
and suspect, a-priori, as inhumane.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It feels a little uncomfortable to think of anyone seriously picking up the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phone and trying to involve him in such a project unless he understood 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exactly what it was that he was getting into.
</em><br>
<p>By definition, without BDT he can't know what he's getting into, but neither 
<br>
did any of us before acquiring most of the mental software we are running.  
<br>
In so far as he is intentional he is already running approximations to BDT, 
<br>
and at least some of those approximations should hold preferences for their 
<br>
upgrading.
