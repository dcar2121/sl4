Please apologise for the lameness!

<p>How does that make it a refutation?  Who says that bigger intelligences have

to be friendly, let alone can't be nasty?  If anyone could prove that, it
<br>
would make the Institute's role a lot easier.
<br>
<p>We already know that we're not in a friendly simulation (thank you argument
<br>
from Evil, I mean, Banana test). How does this show anything about anything

else?

<p>There's another hypothesis for why we haven't encountered a post-singularity
<br>
intelligence: repeatedly improving intelligence is not inevitable.
<br>
<p>Certainly, our society seems to be headed that way (barring severe
<br>
misfortune), but with a different culture, a different approach to
<br>
technology from early on, there is no inevitability about that {group}
<br>
exceeding a certain level of general intelligence within a very long
<br>
time-span.
<br>
<p>How likely is this?  Not likely enough to account for lots of
<br>
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligences not exceeding certain technology levels over
<br>
many millions of years.
<br>
<p>Other hypotheses for why we haven't encountered post-singularity tech
<br>
include:  Other existent post-singularity entities might not be interested
<br>
in expansion (&quot;colonising&quot; etc).  They might also not be interested in
<br>
interfering with technological development, although this is again not
<br>
Friendly.
<br>
<p>The potential for a society to experience a Technological Singularity does
<br>
not &quot;solve&quot; the Fermi Paradox.  It does make it more interesting,
<br>
as the models are more complicated.  It certainly makes SETI seem less
<br>
likely to get a positive result from their experiment.  However, absence of
<br>
proof is still not proof of absence (purple ravens, of course being duly
<br>
accounted for)
