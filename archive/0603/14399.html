What interests me about AGI is that it can become a recursive physics learner; potentially spitting out engineering blueprints that can solve many of our problems.  Are there any baby-AGI projects, AI projects or game environments that have the potential to model a recursive Philosophy learner?  I'm not refering to game-theoric economics AIs that allocate scarce resources to maximize portfolios gains, or anything like that.  I guess the key is to for the AI to understand the &quot;neurology&quot; of a game-agent's goal systems.  And for the AGI to implement solutions that appeal to rearranging the game environment or modifying agent sensory stimulus, rather than tinkering with the &quot;hypothalamus&quot; of the agent's goal systems.  I'm not ready to invest the time in creating such an environment, but if there is already a game out there that can be tweaked a little, I'll contribute.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; start with an immersive 3D gameworld with a simulation engine running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newtonian physics and genetic biology. there must be hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running codebases today that could be merged to provide this.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to experiment with this in practice, I suggest you may
<br>
want to join the AGISim project, a spin-off of the Novamente AGI
<br>
project which is involved with creating an open-source 3D environment
<br>
specifically for AGI development, based on the open-source
<br>
CrystalSpace game engine. The Sourceforge page for AGISim is here:
<br>
<p>sourceforge.net/projects/agisim/
<br>
<p>The one to email if you're interested in becoming involved is Ari
<br>
Heljakka, &quot;heljakka at iki dot fi&quot;
<br>
<p>For example, one task that has not yet been done is to integrate the
<br>
ODE physics engine into AGISim (it already words with CrystalSpace so
<br>
this is not a fundamentally hard task, we just haven't gotten around
<br>
to it yet).
<br>
<p>However, this kind of physics engine is much too simplistic to
<br>
support any kind of realistic physics-based genetics. In fact, we
<br>
don't yet know how to make a physics engine that supports
<br>
physics-based genetics, because no one yet understands the physics
<br>
underlying protein-folding very well.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, I think one could probably make an interesting
<br>
artificial-genetics-based artificial life framework within AGISim,
<br>
which would be nifty because then the adaptive, evolving artificial
<br>
organisms could interact with humanoids controlled by Novamente ;-)
<br>
<p>Regarding your more general point, I doubt very much that AGI is going
<br>
to emerge spontaneously from AI bots inside computer games. This is
<br>
for a number of reasons, including
<br>
<p>* the first AGI is probably going to push the limits of computing
<br>
capability, requiring a network of machines with a lot of RAM, whereas
<br>
AI's running in games need to work on the kind of hardware setup a
<br>
typical gamer can afford
<br>
<p>* a baby AGI is going to be very stupid and boring to play with, which
<br>
is not a great gaming experience. Note that Creatures, while cool,
<br>
was never a very popular game; and Black and White 2 has much less
<br>
focus on teaching the AI's than Black and White 1 did. I see no
<br>
evidence that teaching AI babies is actually considered a fun gaming
<br>
experience by any substantial portion of the gaming market.
<br>
<p>I do think that gaming-style simulation software like CrystalSpace can
<br>
be very useful for AGI and Alife research, but it must be used in
<br>
somewhat different ways than is appropriate for commercial gaming.
<br>
<p>Of course, once you have created a reasonably intelligent AGI, you may
<br>
find ways to deploy it within gaming environments for fun and profit. 
<br>
For instance, an AGI-powered NPC would be really cool in an massive
<br>
multiplayer online role-playing game like World of Warcraft or Final
<br>
Fantasy 11. But the AGI would have to already be pretty clever to be
<br>
marketable in that context. And of course one may find even more
<br>
interesting things to do with a clever AGI...
<br>
