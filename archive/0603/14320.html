<em>&gt; But if you're intelligent you also get the intrinsically valuable fun of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This fun is not intrinsic. I know many who find no joy in solving
<br>
problems. Not every person expending his or her time &amp; money on booze,
<br>
sports, prostitutes, or what have you, instead of on intelligence and
<br>
knowledge improvement (books, conferences, schooling, etc.), does so
<br>
because they're less intelligent than those who find figuring things
<br>
out more fun.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is more fun to do things through your own wits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than to do them via genie bottle.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I know many who would *much* rather have a genie bottle.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the good of intelligence equals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the good it brings us, plus the good of using our intelligence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get it.
</em><br>
<p>Given two people who equally enjoy the feeling of figuring things out,
<br>
one with twice the g of the other (g1 and g2, where g2 = 2g1), it is
<br>
plausible that Mr. g1 and Ms. g2 would have available to them the same
<br>
volume of Fun Space, though those volumes be differently located. Why?
<br>
Because there may be infinitely many problems of difficulty-g1 (such
<br>
that a g1 figure-outer would find them challenging in a fun way) and
<br>
infinitely many *other* problems of difficulty-g2 (ditto). This also
<br>
works for finitely-many-but-enough-such-that-you'd-never-run-out
<br>
quantities of challenging problems at a given difficulty level.
<br>
<p>That such problems might require variations on similar themes, or even
<br>
the same problem with different content (e.g., x-2=5 vs. 2x-3=15), I
<br>
wouldn't be so sure this repetition would bore everyone the way I
<br>
expect you expect it would. How many games of Go must one play before
<br>
Go itself becomes boring? Crossword puzzles? Sudoku? There are many
<br>
intelligence-based challenge games that people seem to never grow
<br>
tired of. Maybe they would eventually -- I couldn't say -- but I
<br>
certainly suggest we don't just take it as an axiom that this or that
<br>
would be boring, and hence that only an increase in the complexity of
<br>
one's problem domain will bring one new fun.
<br>
<p>Your (and my, and others') personal experience, becoming bored with
<br>
progressively more complex challenges, is duly noted. But that may
<br>
have been the result of our becoming more intelligent rather than
<br>
being a reflection of a truism about limited quantities of fun being
<br>
present in a given activity relative to a fixed intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, many intrinsic goods can only take place within a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matrix of supporting intelligence.  Compare chimpanzee Fun Space to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human Fun Space.  Many things we don't think of as stereotypically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;intelligent&quot; fun would be difficult to do without human intelligence.
</em><br>
<p>And many things chimpanzees find Fun, we find boring. The rate of
<br>
funcrease (Fun-gained minus Fun-lost / delta-intelligence) may well be
<br>
positive, and perhaps even exponential. But without more data to
<br>
support this, equivalent Fun Space magnitudes across different
<br>
intelligences seems to remain possible.
