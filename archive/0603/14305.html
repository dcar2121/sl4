<p>Ultimately I believe that getting to the Singularity is going to involve
<br>
massive manipulation of political and religious memetic structures.
<br>
Technology is a necessary, but not sufficient condition. At some point,
<br>
probably within the next ten years, all of what we have been discussing is
<br>
going to become mainstream instead of residing in what most people would
<br>
regard as a SciFi ghetto populated by harmless nerds. How it becomes
<br>
mainstream is what should be a major concern, since there is a real
<br>
possibility of a widespread perception that Transhumanism is a dangerous
<br>
pseudo-religious cult. [BTW, that's what got me thown off Natasha's toy]
<br>
<p>Having said that, while there will undoubtedly be major opposition from the
<br>
NeoLuddites I think it is quite possible to at least bolster our side with
<br>
substantial numbers who are not merely apathetic but enthusiastic
<br>
supporters. IMO these people will *not* come from the scitech community but
<br>
from amongst several existing factions of the general community. One major
<br>
source will be those subsumed under the NewAge heading. Now I know it's
<br>
fashionable to mock them and despise their ignorance of science etc but that
<br>
would be a mistake. For these people, who are a quite substantial slice of
<br>
the population in the West, recasting Transhumanism into a
<br>
religious/spiritual form or forms will be very effective in gaining us much
<br>
needed allies.
<br>
<p>On the political side of things we must thank the Gods that China exists and
<br>
the world is *not* run by an American Empire under Bush and his religious
<br>
zealot cronies. Political paranoia should be sufficient to ensure no global
<br>
suppression of crucial technology takes place. At the very least a critical
<br>
political focus should be setting up Transhumanist orgs in China and
<br>
encouraging the Chinese government to embrace Transhumanist aims, at least
<br>
to the extent of not toeing the US line on 'worldwide bans'. In a perfect
<br>
world the Chinese govt would publicly embrace a Transhumanist agenda in both
<br>
social policy and R&amp;D. That would ensure the tech arrived unimpeded.
