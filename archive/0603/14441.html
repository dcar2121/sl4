Or something.
<br>
<p>This was an idea that occured to me a while back that just came to me again. 
<br>
As we know there are numerous private, commerical, and academic general 
<br>
intelligence development projects going on. I think it is a duty of the 
<br>
Singularity Institute to offer some kind of &quot;First response&quot; system for a 
<br>
potential Singularity take-off. That is, I think that if such an event 
<br>
occured that a project independent of SingInst developed an artificial 
<br>
general intelligence, it would definitely be in the interest of humanity for 
<br>
such (true) claims to be addressed by a superior panel of Friendliness 
<br>
experts (or our best approximation thereof).
<br>
<p>The probability of such a system being of any utility is low, I would 
<br>
suppose, but I think it would be ridiculous not to set something like this 
<br>
up, and to actually advertise the response team's credibility, objectivity, 
<br>
confidentiality, etc etc (or whatever).
<br>
<p>It might just give humanity the tip of the edge necessary for surviving a 
<br>
potential apocalypse (BUT... probably not). I think this is important 
<br>
though. What does everyone else think?
