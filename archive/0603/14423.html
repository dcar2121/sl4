As others have pointed out, this kind of ability is already an object of 
<br>
study in psychology and neuroscience - but I would take issue with some 
<br>
of the comments about it.
<br>
<p>I think it is definitely relevant to SL4, because it gives us some 
<br>
fascinating clues about what is happening in the human cognitive system, 
<br>
and the more clues we have, the more likely we will be able to build an AGI.
<br>
<p>Second, there is some talk of Kim Peek's problem being the lack of a 
<br>
relevance filter.  The problem with this is that, as a theory of what is 
<br>
going on, it is much too simple.  There is an old analogy between a 
<br>
radio circuit and a brain that illustrates the point:  if you stick a 
<br>
screwdriver into the back of a radio and take out a random component, 
<br>
you are quite likely to get a radio that just sits there and makes a 
<br>
squealing sound.  Deduction:  you just knocked out the &quot;squeal 
<br>
suppressor&quot;......?  Much too simplistic.   Same with savant abilities 
<br>
like those of Kim Peek:  its just a missing &quot;relevance filter&quot;?  Well, 
<br>
that is a possible explanation, but I really, really doubt that it will 
<br>
turn out to be that crude.
<br>
<p>Daniel Tammet's ability to multiply seems to be mediated by a 
<br>
shape-memory pathway.  My (admittedly vague) guess would be that he 
<br>
somehow got the shape memory part of his system to encode the math 
<br>
algorithms for multiplication, so that he can feed in the numbers as 
<br>
shapes and get them back as a new shape, corresponding to the product. 
<br>
I would be interested to know what he has been doing all these years, 
<br>
and whether he can perform many other types of mathematical operations.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Next he was asked to divide 13 by 97. This time the researchers had the

<em>&gt; &quot;He is very gifted with words and speaks nine languages and claims to be

<em>&gt; &quot;Daniel had his own surprise, in Oxford, England, he would recite the
