I have had similar thoughts.
<br>
<p>[I have to qualify this by saying that I might have misunderstood what 
<br>
this uncontexted copy from an extropian conversation is actually trying 
<br>
to say....].
<br>
<p>It is often said that a superintelligence would think such esoteric 
<br>
thoughts that we physically incapable of understanding the concepts, 
<br>
never mind sympathizing or relating to them.
<br>
<p>I wonder?  Maybe, as this post implies, there is a threshold, and humans 
<br>
got over it, and now it is just a matter of speed of thought and 
<br>
quantity of context:
<br>
<p>- Speed of Thought:  getting through the same thoughts, but just doing 
<br>
it quicker.
<br>
<p>- Quantity of Context:  Being able to keep an encyclopaedic amount of 
<br>
information in the head, so that the right connections can be made.
<br>
<p>If all intelligences above this critical level are capable of thinking 
<br>
the same kinds of thoughts, the crucial question then becomes:  what 
<br>
motivates the creature?  A superintelligence that could think quicker 
<br>
and more encyclopaedically would not necessarily be different in kind 
<br>
from me (so I could relate to her quite comfortably), but if she were to 
<br>
get her kicks by doing sudoku to the exclusion of everything else, I 
<br>
might not have much basis for a conversation.  She would be a Savant.
<br>
<p>My gut feeling about this is that there might be an asymptotic norm for 
<br>
the motivational system of a superintelligence, which is to give it a 
<br>
modest need for curiosity but nothing else, and that this stripped-down 
<br>
type of motivational system is the most powerful and the one that most 
<br>
easily facilitates communication between different levels of intelligence.
<br>
<p>Another way to put the same thought:  don't give it any weird obsessions 
<br>
and it will be able to relate to humans.
<br>
<p>But now, what is a &quot;weird obsession&quot;?

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Right! This fits my belief. Consider the following sworn testimony of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; abductee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     &quot;The Alien was working on a doctoral dissertation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     entitled &quot;A Human Can Understand Anything that I Can, Only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     it Will Take Him a Lot Longer, and You Will Not Believe the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     Trouble He Has to Go Through&quot; (which, incidentally, happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     to require only three symbols in written Alien language). He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     selected me for his guinea pig, and it took him 23,392 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     to teach me that A proves B. It would have taken him longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     ---several centuries, he said---if I had not already been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     good at math. There were 318 major parts of the theorem, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     over four hundred thousand lemmas. Naturally, I don't pretend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     to have it all &quot;in mind&quot; at the same time, but I vaguely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     remember that even back on Earth by the end of certain long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     math proofs I was kind of fuzzy about how the earlier parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     went. What was essential for my understanding the proof of B
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     was that I built up a set of notes that's pretty elaborate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     (to put it mildly). You can check it out: I was allowed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     bring all my notes back, and they take up nearly a third of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     the surface area of Ceres.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     &quot;My Alien would have failed with a dog or a chimpanzee, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     matter how long he tried. That's because I, as a human, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     the concept of chunking concepts abstractly. Thus in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     dissertation, my Alien proved that we humans are just barely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     on the right side of a complexity barrier that many stupider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     Earth creatures haven't crossed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     &quot;(By the way, don't feel sorry for me! I had the time of my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     Mainly, no doubt, due to the superb drugs and brain stimulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     freely provided.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I would not find such a narrative implausible on *theoretical* grounds.
