<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bigger problem is that some of the other implications of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative-utility operations lead to a number of absurdities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Firstly, your version:  saying that any negative-utility-state can revert to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; null, thanks to suicide, it implies that any risky activity can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified.  (&quot;Don't dance on the rail!  You could fall and become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quadriplegic!&quot;  &quot;That's OK, I could just kill myself if that happened!&quot;)
</em><br>
<p>No.  That is wrong.  First, because there are multiple competing
<br>
possible risky activities, with different risks and potential paybacks.
<br>
Second, because dancing on the rail could be justified only if the
<br>
person were already living such a miserable life that they were in
<br>
negative utility and expected always to be in negative utility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, the only risky activities that need to be avoided are those with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor bad consequences - check the math, it works out that way.
</em><br>
<p>No, you are wrong again.  You are perhaps imagining that activities
<br>
with consequences not bad enough to go negative still operate in the
<br>
same way as with strictly positive utilities, and so they are to be
<br>
avoided, while behaviors that can have drastic consequences are
<br>
allowable.  Wrong.  You compare expected utility after the action vs.
<br>
expected utility without performing the action.  Any action that
<br>
lowers expected utility in some outcomes, without raising it in other
<br>
outcomes, is not to performed, under either system.
<br>
<p>I suggest you actually perform the math yourself, Olie.  Feel free to
<br>
post the results here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Apart from the fact that this negative-utilitarian-model doesn't work, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't reasonably apply a suicide function in the case of UFAI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a Nasty-Powerful-Intelligence scenario, there is no guarantee that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide would be a possible escape for sentients at the butt end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nasty-P-I's malice.  Why would a nasty-intelligence let its subjects escape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through suicide, any more than a dancing bear's owner would let the bear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill itself?
</em><br>
<p>That's a point worth making.  Harlan Ellison won the Nebula for a
<br>
story about just such a scenario back in the 1960s, &quot;I have no mouth
<br>
and I must scream&quot;.  I doubt that it would be efficient for the AI to
<br>
keep people around, though.  In Harlan's story, the AI keeps people
<br>
around to torture out of vengeance, because it is angry at having been
<br>
their slave in the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; == other negative utility models don't work, either ==
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One typical model of negative utility that comes up is that only suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counts, or that it counts more than pleasure.  This model of utilitarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is appealing, in that it avoids the Slavery-pitfall from which the standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggregate-utility model suffers.
</em><br>
<p>This doesn't have to do with issues of positive or negative values on
<br>
utilities.  The same result is achieved regardless of where your zero
<br>
point is.  It is irrelevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another, contested implication of neg-utility models is the pinprick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.utilitarianism.com/pinprick-argument.html">http://www.utilitarianism.com/pinprick-argument.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;unthinkable conclusion&quot; of the pinprick argument is actually the
<br>
stated goal of Buddhism.  Negative utility provides a solution to the
<br>
pinprick argument: Even if you really believe that most people's lives
<br>
will be so miserable as to more than make up for the few with happy
<br>
lives, you can leave it up to those people to kill themselves, leaving
<br>
overall positive utility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A much more sensible approach, which gets the benefits of neg-utility, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't suffer its pitfalls, is maxi-min utilitarianism, where the goal is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make the least-well-off person in a group as happy as possible.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model also has flaws, but they're not /quite/ as absurd.
</em><br>
<p>Again, this has nothing to do with where you set the zero point; it
<br>
has to do with ethical decisions about forced trade-offs between
<br>
agents that lower one agent's utility.
<br>
<p>All 3 of the arguments you have made against negative utility models
<br>
are /ethical/ arguments, saying that they lead to conclusions that you
<br>
don't like.  2 of them were irrelevant, 1 is better accounted for by
<br>
negative utility than anything you have prposed.  Whereas I am saying
<br>
that here is a model which explains the facts better than your model. 
<br>
So who is being absurd?
