</em><br>
<p>Or not, if it's a matter of choice.  Vide the novel VALENCIES (1983, 
<br>
by you-know-who and Rory Barnes):
<br>
<p>=============
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issues of metaphysical sturdiness came to her attention, 
<br>
as they'd been known to do, provisionally penned in the kennels to 
<br>
which she'd assigned them, whimpering for the final disposition she 
<br>
was fairly unlikely to make on their behalf.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morality was one. She was certainly no stranger to the 
<br>
problems of axiology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely word, that. Axiology: theory of value. It seemed to 
<br>
contain its own solutions: axe your way through the Gordian knot, 
<br>
acts of piety, access to truth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...It kept coming back to that silly question: &quot;Why should 
<br>
we be moral?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A surprisingly large number of people thought that you 
<br>
should be, and even considered it to be a moral obligation. Ha ha, 
<br>
boom boom. But suppose you used the word &quot;should&quot; as an evaluative 
<br>
and motivational expression, instead of a normative one? If you wish 
<br>
to climb to the top of the mountain, you should walk up rather than down.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course last time she'd come along this track she'd 
<br>
detected a snag with &quot;evaluative&quot;, too, but that was on the next 
<br>
level up and you had to start somewhere.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, take Ralfo as your representative simple 
<br>
unreflecting man. Persuade him of the vileness of imperialism. Crisis 
<br>
for Ralf. Echoing voids of doubt, disillusion and guilt. Never again, 
<br>
as the poet said, will he be certain that what he imagines are the 
<br>
clear dictates of moral reason are not merely the ingrained and 
<br>
customary beliefs of his time and place...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so then he might ask himself what he could do in the 
<br>
future to avoid prejudices and provincial mores, or, more to the 
<br>
point, almost universally accepted mores--and thus to discover what 
<br>
he really ought to do.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was merely another normative enquiry, though; the 
<br>
tough one was &quot;show me that there is some form of behavior which I am 
<br>
obliged to endorse. &quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moral constraint seemed to mean either that you should 
<br>
pursue good ends and eschew bad ones, or that you should be faithful 
<br>
to one or more correct rules of conduct. Greeks and Taoists versus 
<br>
Hebrews and Confucians, yeah, yeah.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Incredible to think that they'd been chewing on this 
<br>
for upward of four thousand years without coming to a definitive, 
<br>
intuitively overwhelming conclusion. But then the imperial 
<br>
ideologists thought they had, didn't they, with their jolly old 
<br>
stochastic memetic-extrapolatory hedonic calculus or whatever the 
<br>
fuck they were calling it these days. The least retardation of 
<br>
optimal development for the greatest number, world without end, or at 
<br>
least until the trend functions blur out. So they managed to get both 
<br>
streams of thought into one ethical scholium without solving 
<br>
anything. After all, why obey a rule like that? And who gets to 
<br>
define as &quot;good&quot; those magical parameters making up the package 
<br>
called &quot;optimal development&quot;?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The besieged libertarians on Chomsky, she thought darkly, 
<br>
might differ from Ralf on the question of the good life.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, even if we all agreed that certain parameters were 
<br>
good, why should that oblige us to promote their furtherance? It 
<br>
might be prudent good sense to do so, and aesthetically pleasing, and 
<br>
satisfy some itch we all have, and save us from being raped in the 
<br>
common, but then the sublime constraining force you sort of imagine 
<br>
the idea of moral obligation having just evaporates into self-serving 
<br>
circumspection.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly there was that tricky number of Kant's about us 
<br>
possessing a rational nature, and being noumena instead of brute 
<br>
phenomena, and thus not being able to act immorally without 
<br>
self-contradiction, but any fool could see that that went too far on 
<br>
the one hand and not far enough on the other, and anyway what was 
<br>
wrong with a bit of self-contradiction if you stopped when you needed 
<br>
eye implants?
