<p>
the list has been a little quiet for a couple of days, so I thought
<br>
I'd gag up something I've been mulling over for a while...
<br>
<p>I'm thinking it might be possible to develop evolving in-game
<br>
lifeforms of trivial general intelligence. and I think that the code
<br>
is not only possible today, but that it's already here.
<br>
<p>let me explain my basis in contrast to the kurzweil/moravec notion of
<br>
replacing existing brain elements with inorganic equivalents to
<br>
produce a thinking being - with the contrast being that I see the
<br>
moravec approach as being top-down, while I believe there is a
<br>
distinct possibility of a bottom-up path-to-intelligence.
<br>
<p>two more elements are needed for this position: evolution and reverse
<br>
engineering. of course the validity of a moravec-mind is needed as
<br>
well, but let's just make than an assumption for this case that can
<br>
(and I'm sure has) be discussed at length in other threads.
<br>
<p>start with an immersive 3D gameworld with a simulation engine running
<br>
newtonian physics and genetic biology. there must be hundreds of
<br>
running codebases today that could be merged to provide this.
<br>
<p>then, you reverse engineer the properties of an amoeba. you define
<br>
it's sequenced genome in logic, and you assign these properties and
<br>
abilities to in-game programmed objects, and then you let them loose
<br>
in a newtonian phyics based simworld with elements, seasons, sunlight
<br>
and resources. Remember that much of existing science, and physics
<br>
especially, is just reverse engineering; gravity existed long before
<br>
we named it so, as did carbon. We now have a very, very complete
<br>
understanding of the sub-cosmic and super-quantum realms; more than
<br>
enough to replicate organic existence with incredible realism.
<br>
<p>now we know all the answers to how this world should behave, and how
<br>
this ameoba should develop, as it's already happened in our past; we
<br>
have a perfect history of it all preserved for comparison. if the
<br>
world starts to diverge markedly, you can tweak the ratios that
<br>
determine random changes via scarcity of resources, overpopulation,
<br>
climate change etc that drive evolutionary development. you can
<br>
program the basic imperatives of an amoeba; feed, grow, compete,
<br>
survive, divide. yes, the simulation is more complex than my basic
<br>
examples. but I think rigorous apllication of attention to detail
<br>
could overcome any inconsistencies or incompleteness.
<br>
<p>if you build on this, again and again, in painstaking detail, you
<br>
should eventually get to something substantial. how many data points
<br>
are required to map the complete genetic evolutionary development from
<br>
an ameoba to a fieldmouse? alot? sure. an infinite amount? no. we have
<br>
those records, preserved for posterity in thin layers of earth; we can
<br>
trace every step, and then provide a mirror environment to reproduce
<br>
it. and if we can get from ameoba-like to mouse-like satisfactorily,
<br>
can we then progress our bottom-up approach from mouse-like to, well,
<br>
dog-like? monkey-like? man-like? you tell me.
<br>
<p>if this is all sounding too outlandish or complex to simulate at the
<br>
technical level, there's a another 80's tech staple thats coming out
<br>
if it's own winter to help out: Procedural Generation (PG). This is
<br>
how the gameworld terrains of 80's titles generated their in-game
<br>
enivronments when gig's of animations on a dvd weren't an option. This
<br>
procedural approach says you don't have to create a world by hand; you
<br>
just set up the rules, press go, and let the world generate itself.
<br>
This is also the technique used by demoscene developers; check out
<br>
what 64k(!) of procedural generation can do here:

<br>
<p>Wil Wright is the gaming legend is currently championing this, and
<br>
Spore is the game due out this year which is currently knocking my
<br>
socks off.
<br>
<p>the first third of this video is a must-watch:
<br>
<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;q=spore">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;q=spore</a><br>
<p>and a writeup of the game (and PG) is here:
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(game">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(game</a>)
<br>
<p>Wright isn't just using PG for textures or tiles; he's also using it
<br>
for biomechanics and evolutionary characteristics like swimming,
<br>
walking, hunting, killing, eating and mating. None of the in-game
<br>
creatures in Spore are modelled prior to installing the game. every
<br>
single one evolves using an array of possible physical development
<br>
paths to come to life as completely unique organisms that execute
<br>
motile ability in a completely (un)natural way. If you haven't watch
<br>
the video linked above, I'd recommend doing so now.
<br>
<p>Now the interesting part to all this is that when playing Spore,
<br>
you'll be competing against AI-generated evolving orgranisms; and I
<br>
think if the simulation is realistic enough, and the properties of the
<br>
organisms detailed enough, then we'll be starting to enter the
<br>
god-mode lobby of the SA you lot have been fascinated with lately.
<br>
<p>It seems more and more that if we use sufficently comprehensive narrow
<br>
AI to generate
<br>
simulations of our in-historic-light-cone world that we can create
<br>
glimpes of real intelligence in our simulations.
<br>
<p>There are growing examples of in-game AI generating AGI-like eruptions
<br>
of higher-intelligence-like behaviour. One the recent (elder scrolls
<br>
iv?) mmorpg games had testers walk into a in-game-evolved
<br>
previously-unvisited villiage where none of the townspeople would let
<br>
them in. turns out the villiage guards had gotten drunk and gone
<br>
hunting and gotten lost, and then bandits had raided the villiage.
<br>
each narrow-AI indivdiual guard|bandit|townsperson had combined to
<br>
generate an effect more like that which could be envisioned by a
<br>
higher intellect.
<br>
<p>there's also this older example from 2001:
<br>
&quot;This ability to discriminate has already produced some real surprises
<br>
for testers and creators alike during development. In one situation,
<br>
there was a creature that kept losing a stone-throwing game to another
<br>
creature. To get revenge, the first creature heated a rock, planted it
<br>
in the pile of stones to be thrown and then fell on the floor laughing
<br>
when its rival burned its hands. All this happened without
<br>
intervention from the player.&quot;

<br>
<p>The next-gen consoles with their Cell processors are supposedly ideal
<br>
for the 'Procedural Syntheisis' needed to implement Procedural
<br>
Generation - does this mean the next glimmer of basic AGI will come
<br>
from the living room instead of the lab?
