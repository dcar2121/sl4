<em>&gt; This kind of thing isn't sl4 to me. Interesting, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not I think holding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great promise for AI research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Testing of savants like Kim Peek has revealed that
<br>
they lack a &quot;relevance filter&quot; that attaches a most
<br>
probable meaning to things.  For example the phrase
<br>
<p>Paris in the
<br>
the spring
<br>
<p>is often read by normal people as &quot;Paris in the
<br>
spring&quot;,
<br>
while savants are more likely to catch the double
<br>
&quot;the&quot;
<br>
<p>Filtering the wealth of data our senses present for
<br>
the most probable/relevant items may have evolved
<br>
to deal with an environment that didn't change much,
<br>
and could eat you if you aren't paying attention
<br>
to important clues.
<br>
<p>In our modern civilization, seeing things the way
<br>
they really are rather than the way we think they
<br>
should be might be a better strategy, so lowering
<br>
the filters could be useful.
<br>
<p>If the difference between savants and the rest of
<br>
us is how their brains are wired, not much could be
<br>
done in the near term to emulate their abilities.
<br>
If, however the difference is biochemical, it might
<br>
be amenable to drugs or other things we can make
<br>
use of in the near term.
<br>
<p>The other question is whether Kim Peek's ability
<br>
to remember everything he has ever read is 
<br>
superceded by Google.  i.e. if savant abilities
<br>
can be effectively implemented by computers, then
<br>
us normals can effectively gain those abilities
<br>
by using the computers.
