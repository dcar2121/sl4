</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, it is a reasonable assumption to make that mathematics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic apply in all spheres. Hence we could certainly model a variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of external realities to a degree even if we did not know what it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically. Of course, one might suppose that an external reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could only be modelled using uncomputable numbers might screw up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that option a bit...
</em><br>
<p>Reality doesn't conform to maths. We use maths to describe reality.
<br>
Reality doesn't give a damn about maths.
<br>
<p>It's an article of faith that reality is describable by logic and
<br>
mathematics. I don't normally bother to harp on this point, because it's
<br>
obvious how much success we've had applying science and maths to reality
<br>
so far. But even to date, we have mathematical difficulties explaining
<br>
all phenomena.
<br>
<p>Reality could be fundamentally different in lots and lots of ways. We
<br>
can apply high-level abstractions to thinking about what might be
<br>
outside our container, but not (I would argue) low-level ones.
<br>
<p>We could use a computer to simulate a number of near-realities, and also
<br>
a number of realities which we can conceive of. But we can't model that
<br>
which we can't imagine.
<br>
<p>That's why I think &quot;outside-in&quot; reasoning about what can be modelled is
<br>
flawed. It makes sense to us in our reality that we could model our own
<br>
reality (to some extent) or at least capture its rules. I'm fairly sure
<br>
it's provably impossible to *actually* simulate our reality in our
<br>
reality. (i.e. hard information limits)
