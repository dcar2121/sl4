How long is the time window during which a civilization relies on 
<br>
powerful radio broadcasts for  communication before upgrading to cable 
<br>
and/or narrow-beam methods? There could be a high-tech civilization on 
<br>
Alpha Centauri for all we know, but either still in that long pre-radio 
<br>
phase that occupied most of our own history, or in a post-radio phase 
<br>
and not doing anything else we would notice from a distance.

technology?
