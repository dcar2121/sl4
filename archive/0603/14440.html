</em><br>
<em>&gt; US 6,889,376 B1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Method for migrating from one computer to another

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. A method for migrating a user's software programs from a first to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second computer, the method comprising the steps of:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identifying on the first computer, software products having software
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product files and product data files requiring to be prepared for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future migration;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; packing the software product files and the product data files in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner that enables them to be moved at a future point in time to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second computer, based on the identifying step previously executed;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operating the first computer in accordance with a general purpose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereof including by running the software product files or generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated user files after the packing in the first computer;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further including storing data files changes and/or control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information changes generated by running the software products on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first computer and additionally packing the changes for use on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second computer;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving the previously packed software product files and the product
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data files without using cloning to the second computer, except for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; files that are manually excluded, said moving of files being carried
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out without resorting to examining or considering all files of said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first computer including those that are not associated with said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identified software products being prepared for future migration; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpacking the moved software product files and the product data files
</em><br>
<em>&gt; onto the second computer.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yup:  software patents are truly ridiculous.
<br>
<p>To get a software patent, think of a vague idea for doing [substitute 
<br>
totally vague idea here], and then write a patent that lists all the 
<br>
ways that data can move from A to B, and stipulate that if someone moves 
<br>
data like that, and the data was moved while it was being used for 
<br>
[substitute vague idea here], then it infringes your patent.   Works 
<br>
like a dream.
<br>
<p>I once developed an idea for using some technology to let people wander 
<br>
around a worldwide shared virtual universe, rather like Gibson's 
<br>
cyberspace.  Guess what?  Sony owns the patent on any technique that you 
<br>
happen to use to have any kind of worldwide shared 3D space!  They don't 
<br>
say how to do it, they don't give eny technological details, they 
<br>
basically just say &quot;If you move data around on the internet and it is 
<br>
intended as a part of a 3D shared virtual world that everyone on the 
<br>
planet is sharing, you are infringing our patent.&quot;  The vast bulk of the 
<br>
patent was just a list of all the different ways that data could move 
<br>
around.
<br>
<p>The Sony patent came long after Neuromancer, so you'd think it would be 
<br>
void.  But do I have the money to point this out to Sony's attorneys in 
<br>
court?  Not me, no sirree.
