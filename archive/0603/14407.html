</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't intend to get deep into this, but here's some quick comments:
<br>
<p>On Scientific Rigor
<br>
<p>Section 2 here is mostly just sour grapes... I mean really, complaining that 
<br>
this book had the audacity to use data that you yourself compiled. But as an 
<br>
overall point that the book indeed is not a scientific treatise, well duh. Of 
<br>
course it is not. It's not intended to be that kind of document. I'd like to see 
<br>
a whole area of science devoted to studying this stuff, in fact SIAI is kicking 
<br>
around the idea of splitting off an effort into helping launch such an effort, 
<br>
but this book is not intended to fulfill that need. It's more of a wake up call.
<br>
<p>Section 3, complaining about where Kurzweil picks for the knee of his graphs, 
<br>
and that he is &quot;arbitrarily&quot; choosing the Y axis numbers in a biased way, just 
<br>
seems silly to me. Kurzweil tends to choose orders of magnitude for the Y axis 
<br>
of his graphs in order to more effectively show the types of changes we find 
<br>
ourself heading into, but these complaints about his presentation choices don't 
<br>
change the underlying facts at all... the graph is heading upwards, and we 
<br>
happen to be alive at a moment where the particular Y axis points we expect to 
<br>
hit soon will have far ranging effects in real life.
<br>
<p>Where Are We on the Curve?
<br>
<p>A big problem here where he brings up Moore's Law and claims Kurzweil agrees 
<br>
&quot;Moore’s law will reach the end of its S‑curve before 2020&quot; and comes up with an 
<br>
expectation of us being a factor of 30 away from the ultimate limit of computing 
<br>
progress?
<br>
<p>This seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of one of Kurzweil's points that 
<br>
computing power increases through multiple paradigms, and that he fully expects 
<br>
there to be additional paradigms past the current one of silicon chips. In fact 
<br>
Kurzweil spends some time later in the book, which apparently this guy didn't 
<br>
get to, where he does attempt to point out what the maximum natural limits of 
<br>
computational power might be, and they are way way beyond 30 times our current 
<br>
abilities.
<br>
<p>The other graphs have little relevance, other than showing yes indeed single 
<br>
paradigms eventually top out. Again, missing the main point.
<br>
<p>Moving on to the &quot;On The Singularity&quot; section
<br>
<p>I have no idea where he is pulling 6x10^23 ops on page 71 of the book from for 
<br>
expected supercomputer speeds in 2045. There is a graph on page 70 of my book 
<br>
that shows something in that area FOR $1000, but that is not a supercomputer. 
<br>
Additionally we have this guy again then attempting to impose his 
<br>
single-paradigm S curve limits. Kurzweil does back up later in the book his 
<br>
guesstimates of computing power much higher than the 10^25 range, but this guy 
<br>
either didn't read it or doesn't want to respond to it.
<br>
<p>Section 2: looks like more imposition of this guy's single-paradigm viewpoint.
<br>
<p>In Summary
<br>
<p>All four summary bullet points seem to be utterly destroyed by the 
<br>
misunderstanding of shifting paradigms, and S curve upon new S curve, and the 
<br>
fact that in many cases the curves Kurzweil shows are meta curves that subsume 
<br>
these multiple paradigms into one graph.
