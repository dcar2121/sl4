<p>
one idea:
<br>
<p>if posts get moderated pre-mailout: any chance said moderator can
<br>
prepend 'sl4-phil' or 'sl4-nano' or 'sl4-rant' (etc) to each candidate
<br>
post that they review and judge as belonging to a given post bucket?
<br>
<p>if posts don't get moderated pre-mailout: posters can prepend their
<br>
own prefixes (e.g. '[sl4-meta]' above, and existing moderators - or
<br>
new precious souls adjudged as master-of-said-bucket - can then snipe
<br>
anyone who tries to sneak a bit of *insert-shoddy-wishwash-here* into
<br>
a discussion of *insert-serious-browfurrowing-material-here*
<br>
<p>then: those not disposed to view subjects they see as a waste of
<br>
breath (or beneath them, or
<br>
insert-symptom-of-mild-dyssocial-disorder-here) can just filter
<br>
whichever '[sl4-imbecilic]' they'd like to see given a good bollocking
<br>
in their spam folder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Generally, this list isn't a place for &quot;Transhumanist discussion&quot;.
</em><br>
question: any tips on where to go for such discussion? my friday-night
<br>
posts tend to lap up a bit of such, possibly due to a few beers after
<br>
work, so I'd like to maybe find out about where I can have a bit of a
<br>
drunken rant to satisfy my wont :-)
<br>
<p>also, something in me cringes when we start staking out 'hallowed
<br>
ground' in terms of 'don't walk on the grass' coversational no-no's.
<br>
smacks way too much of self-censorship, and the general boomer-whinge
<br>
malaise of being too past it to have an energetic and/or valid grasp
<br>
of the issues anymore while still being possessed of idea-snuffing
<br>
disparagement skills of the first order, honed over years of
<br>
self-satisfying cynicism. mocking, putdowns and 'crazy people/idiots'
<br>
vents can give great satisfaction - no arguments there - but there is
<br>
as good a chance as any that we're all biased narrow-minded hacks so a
<br>
bit of devil's advocate spice might well do some good. where would we
<br>
be without well-spoken advocates of positions we despise? lacking some
<br>
good healthy roughage I suspect.
<br>
<p>that said, it's your list people, and you'll take your tonka truck and
<br>
go home sulking at your own behest; My brethren (if such exist!) and I
<br>
are little, little people and shall cringe appropriately at the
<br>
wielding of your mighty meta-sword :-)
