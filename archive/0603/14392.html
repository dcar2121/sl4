Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; start with an immersive 3D gameworld with a simulation engine running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newtonian physics and genetic biology. there must be hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running codebases today that could be merged to provide this.
</em><br>
<p>If you want to experiment with this in practice, I suggest you may
<br>
want to join the AGISim project, a spin-off of the Novamente AGI
<br>
project which is involved with creating an open-source 3D environment
<br>
specifically for AGI development, based on the open-source
<br>
CrystalSpace game engine.  The Sourceforge page for AGISim is here:
<br>
<p>sourceforge.net/projects/agisim/
<br>
<p>The one to email if you're interested in becoming involved is Ari
<br>
Heljakka, &quot;heljakka at iki dot fi&quot;
<br>
<p>For example, one task that has not yet been done is to integrate the
<br>
ODE physics engine into AGISim (it already words with CrystalSpace so
<br>
this is not a fundamentally hard task, we just haven't gotten around
<br>
to it yet).
<br>
<p>However,  this kind of physics engine is much too simplistic to
<br>
support any kind of realistic physics-based genetics.  In fact, we
<br>
don't yet know how to make a physics engine that supports
<br>
physics-based genetics, because no one yet understands the physics
<br>
underlying protein-folding very well.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, I think one could probably make an interesting
<br>
artificial-genetics-based artificial life framework within AGISim,
<br>
which would be nifty because then the adaptive, evolving artificial
<br>
organisms could interact with humanoids controlled by Novamente ;-)
<br>
<p>Regarding your more general point, I doubt very much that AGI is going
<br>
to emerge spontaneously from AI bots inside computer games.  This is
<br>
for a number of reasons, including
<br>
<p>* the first AGI is probably going to push the limits of computing
<br>
capability, requiring a network of machines with a lot of RAM, whereas
<br>
AI's running in games need to work on the kind of hardware setup a
<br>
typical gamer can afford
<br>
<p>* a baby AGI is going to be very stupid and boring to play with, which
<br>
is not a great gaming experience.  Note that Creatures, while cool,
<br>
was never a very popular game; and Black and White 2 has much less
<br>
focus on teaching the AI's than Black and White 1 did.  I see no
<br>
evidence that teaching AI babies is actually considered a fun gaming
<br>
experience by any substantial portion of the gaming market.
<br>
<p>I do think that gaming-style simulation software like CrystalSpace can
<br>
be very useful for AGI and Alife research, but it must be used in
<br>
somewhat different ways than is appropriate for commercial gaming.
<br>
<p>Of course, once you have created a reasonably intelligent AGI, you may
<br>
find ways to deploy it within gaming environments for fun and profit. 
<br>
For instance, an AGI-powered NPC would be really cool in an massive
<br>
multiplayer online role-playing game like World of Warcraft or Final
<br>
Fantasy 11.  But the AGI would have to already be pretty clever to be
<br>
marketable in that context.  And of course one may find even more
<br>
interesting things to do with a clever AGI...

<p><p><em>&gt; then, you reverse engineer the properties of an amoeba. you define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's sequenced genome in logic, and you assign these properties and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abilities to in-game programmed objects, and then you let them loose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a newtonian phyics based simworld with elements, seasons, sunlight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and resources. Remember that much of existing science, and physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially, is just reverse engineering; gravity existed long before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we named it so, as did carbon. We now have a very, very complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the sub-cosmic and super-quantum realms; more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to replicate organic existence with incredible realism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now we know all the answers to how this world should behave, and how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this ameoba should develop, as it's already happened in our past; we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a perfect history of it all preserved for comparison. if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world starts to diverge markedly, you can tweak the ratios that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine random changes via scarcity of resources, overpopulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; climate change etc that drive evolutionary development. you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program the basic imperatives of an amoeba; feed, grow, compete,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive, divide. yes, the simulation is more complex than my basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples. but I think rigorous apllication of attention to detail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could overcome any inconsistencies or incompleteness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you build on this, again and again, in painstaking detail, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should eventually get to something substantial. how many data points
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are required to map the complete genetic evolutionary development from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ameoba to a fieldmouse? alot? sure. an infinite amount? no. we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those records, preserved for posterity in thin layers of earth; we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trace every step, and then provide a mirror environment to reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. and if we can get from ameoba-like to mouse-like satisfactorily,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can we then progress our bottom-up approach from mouse-like to, well,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dog-like? monkey-like? man-like? you tell me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if this is all sounding too outlandish or complex to simulate at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technical level, there's a another 80's tech staple thats coming out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it's own winter to help out: Procedural Generation (PG). This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how the gameworld terrains of 80's titles generated their in-game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enivronments when gig's of animations on a dvd weren't an option. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedural approach says you don't have to create a world by hand; you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just set up the rules, press go, and let the world generate itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is also the technique used by demoscene developers; check out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what 64k(!) of procedural generation can do here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://awards.scene.org/nominees.php?cat=9">http://awards.scene.org/nominees.php?cat=9</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wil Wright is the gaming legend is currently championing this, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spore is the game due out this year which is currently knocking my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socks off.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first third of this video is a must-watch:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;q=spore">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8372603330420559198&amp;q=spore</a></em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a writeup of the game (and PG) is here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(game">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spore_(game</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wright isn't just using PG for textures or tiles; he's also using it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for biomechanics and evolutionary characteristics like swimming,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walking, hunting, killing, eating and mating. None of the in-game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures in Spore are modelled prior to installing the game. every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single one evolves using an array of possible physical development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paths to come to life as completely unique organisms that execute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motile ability in a completely (un)natural way. If you haven't watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the video linked above, I'd recommend doing so now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now the interesting part to all this is that when playing Spore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'll be competing against AI-generated evolving orgranisms; and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think if the simulation is realistic enough, and the properties of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organisms detailed enough, then we'll be starting to enter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god-mode lobby of the SA you lot have been fascinated with lately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems more and more that if we use sufficently comprehensive narrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations of our in-historic-light-cone world that we can create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glimpes of real intelligence in our simulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are growing examples of in-game AI generating AGI-like eruptions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of higher-intelligence-like behaviour. One the recent (elder scrolls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iv?) mmorpg games had testers walk into a in-game-evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously-unvisited villiage where none of the townspeople would let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them in. turns out the villiage guards had gotten drunk and gone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunting and gotten lost, and then bandits had raided the villiage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each narrow-AI indivdiual guard|bandit|townsperson had combined to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate an effect more like that which could be envisioned by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher intellect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's also this older example from 2001:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This ability to discriminate has already produced some real surprises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for testers and creators alike during development. In one situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was a creature that kept losing a stone-throwing game to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creature. To get revenge, the first creature heated a rock, planted it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the pile of stones to be thrown and then fell on the floor laughing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when its rival burned its hands. All this happened without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intervention from the player.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237848.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1237848.stm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The next-gen consoles with their Cell processors are supposedly ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the 'Procedural Syntheisis' needed to implement Procedural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Generation - does this mean the next glimmer of basic AGI will come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the living room instead of the lab?
