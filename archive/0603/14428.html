<em>&gt;&gt; Daniel Tammet's ability to multiply seems to be mediated by a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; shape-memory pathway.  My (admittedly vague) guess would be that he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; somehow got the shape memory part of his system to encode the math 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; algorithms for multiplication, so that he can feed in the numbers as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; shapes and get them back as a new shape, corresponding to the product. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I would be interested to know what he has been doing all these years, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and whether he can perform many other types of mathematical operations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think what it really comes down to is just a superior short term 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory. For example, I can take any two digit number and calculate it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fourth power (albeit far more slowly and error prone). I notice that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can maintain the algorithmic &quot;ultra-fluidity&quot; that he seems so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proficient with in the numbers, however, as the size of the data sets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to remember grow, I have to continually &quot;break&quot; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultra-fluid data manipulation in order to mentally repeat the data sets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so that they remains unambiguous. So not only do we have to mentally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement the algorithm in such a way that the output is incrementally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built from some input, but also it is necessary to remember the input 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the output. The thing with savants, it appears, is that they have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some particularly mental balance, in such a way that they can maintain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ultra-fluid flow of the mental algorithm, and the output and input 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be remembed entirely unambigiously, without constantly repeating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It sure would be nice to figure out how to do that, if it's not an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unchangeable quality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't believe it is an unchangeable quality, because I have noticed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the ability for me to remember in such a manner is related to my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular state of mind. But I won't get into that right now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In general I agree that some savants might be using the mechanism you 
<br>
describe, at least in part:  they either don't need a rehearsal buffer 
<br>
because their STM is so big that it can keep long strings up without 
<br>
losing them, or they have such an efficient buffer that they can cycle 
<br>
the numbers back in without having to attend to them (those two things 
<br>
might turn out to be equivalent).
<br>
<p>What intrigues me more, though, is Daniel's apparent use of shapes.  We 
<br>
appear to have a separate facility for dealing with 3D spatial stuff, so 
<br>
I wonder if he isn't doing it using that facility, rather than with a 
<br>
super efficient STM?
<br>
<p>I had a similar experience, just once, when my Physics teacher at school 
<br>
tried to impress us with his very first calculator, which had a square 
<br>
root key.  He remembered his calculator in the middle of a blackboard 
<br>
calculation where he needed a square root, so he proudly grabbed the 
<br>
calculator and started trying to get the number into it.  Just for fun, 
<br>
I tried to do it in my head before his calculator did it:  I visualised 
<br>
the square root function as a graph, used a bit of &quot;feel&quot; for where the 
<br>
result ought to be, and started naming the digits of the answer.  As I 
<br>
got down to the lower digits the &quot;feels&quot; coming back from somewhere down 
<br>
in my subconscious became more tenuous, but I tried to be sensitive for 
<br>
what felt like &quot;too big&quot; or &quot;too little&quot;, and then on the last digit I 
<br>
just made a blind guess, just for fun.
<br>
<p>Altogether there were only about five or six digits in my answer (and in 
<br>
fact that was all his calculator could handle)... and it turned out that 
<br>
my answer was exactly right, including the last wild guess digit.  [The 
<br>
confused look on the teacher's face, when he realized that someone had 
<br>
produced the answer just before his calculator, was priceless :-)]
<br>
<p>What was interesting was that the result came from this weird sense of 
<br>
groping for the right digits, and being sensitive to a bunch of 
<br>
mechanisms, somewhere inside, that were all trying to push the answer 
<br>
this way or that.  It did not have the feel of a calculation at all 
<br>
(goes without saying anyway, since I would barely have known how to set 
<br>
up such a computation).  Although this wasn't shape memory, there was a 
<br>
graph there at the beginning.
<br>
<p>Some savants may be using similar techniques, but developed into vastly 
<br>
more complex versions.  Maybe hundreds of &quot;subconcious&quot; mechanisms that 
<br>
all compete with each other to determine the digits of a result, getting 
<br>
to the target digits by a process of relaxation.  I could imagine such 
<br>
relaxation mechanisms that were exactly isomorphic to a regular serial 
<br>
algorithm, so they really could come up with extremely accurate digits, 
<br>
one by one.
<br>
<p>If such a relaxation calculator could be learned by the savant, the best 
<br>
place to locate it might indeed be in a coopted chunk of the visual 
<br>
system, where we already know that there is lots of relaxation-type 
<br>
computation going on.  And if it _were_ located there, the savant might 
<br>
consciously experience it as some kind of imagined shape visualization.
<br>
<p>I confess, I haven't had much time to go and read the details of what 
<br>
Daniel has said, so feel free to shoot down this theory of his 
<br>
particular functioning, if the data conflict with it.
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
