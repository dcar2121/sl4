<p>
one of the themes that seems to stand out with all this is that these
<br>
kids are 'savants' - which implicitly labels them as 'idiot savants'
<br>
at worst, and at best people who happen to be good at one thing and
<br>
are just as average as the rest of us at everything else.
<br>
<p>it's a comfortable notion; the same one that is used to make us feel
<br>
better when we're overawed by our inferiority to supermodels,
<br>
billionaires, newsanchors and 100m track stars. We happily think they
<br>
may have lucked out in one arena but are otherwise just as deeply
<br>
flawed as the general community.
<br>
<p>there's an accepted idea of a genetic bargain that must be struck; a
<br>
mutual exclusivity of talents, with beauty=!brains, brawn=!beauty,
<br>
brains=!brawn.
<br>
<p>there's also the 'flawed genius' cliche; i.e. the wasted talent who
<br>
had so much potential. The nerd too coversationally inept to function,
<br>
the alcoholic jock, the manic-depressive extrovert, the obsessively
<br>
misguided prodigy. We reassure ourselves that superior talents
<br>
&quot;weren't tough enough&quot; and that their fall by the wayside proved that
<br>
while we were lesser mortals the fact that we &quot;made it&quot; means that we
<br>
were superior when it came to &quot;the crunch&quot;.
<br>
<p>I think these kids could well be better than us at everything, and not
<br>
just their savant-talent. Their moral centre, reasoning power, good
<br>
looks and athletic ability could well be superior to us all. Add into
<br>
that superhuman powers at certain useful feats and you have quite a
<br>
little transcendant-compared-to-human-of-yesteryear package.
<br>
<p>While overall worldwide population growth rates are decreasing, the
<br>
real number of kids born every year is still significantly larger. 37M
<br>
a year population increase in 1950 versus 74M today
<br>
(<a href="http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html">http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldpop.html</a>).
<br>
<p>That means twice as many chances at the roll of the dice. So while
<br>
there are twice as many kids just as talented as you are, there are
<br>
half again even more talented. As the bell curve raises in volume and
<br>
lengthens at the taper, there are going to be more and more
<br>
super-talents, more and more unflawed geniuses.
<br>
<p>So give the kids their due. It's hard to admit one's own obselescence,
<br>
but could well be necessary for these more-superhuman-than-us
<br>
descendants to achieve the singularity instead of having their chance
<br>
at the cup choked back by our refusal to let go of the reins and be
<br>
sidelined as well-meaning but ultimately inferior also-rans.
