<em>&gt;As others have pointed out, this kind of ability is already an object of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;study in psychology and neuroscience - but I would take issue with some of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the comments about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think it is definitely relevant to SL4, because it gives us some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fascinating clues about what is happening in the human cognitive system, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the more clues we have, the more likely we will be able to build an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Second, there is some talk of Kim Peek's problem being the lack of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relevance filter.  The problem with this is that, as a theory of what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going on, it is much too simple.  There is an old analogy between a radio 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circuit and a brain that illustrates the point:  if you stick a screwdriver 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into the back of a radio and take out a random component, you are quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely to get a radio that just sits there and makes a squealing sound.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Deduction:  you just knocked out the &quot;squeal suppressor&quot;......?  Much too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simplistic.   Same with savant abilities like those of Kim Peek:  its just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a missing &quot;relevance filter&quot;?  Well, that is a possible explanation, but I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really, really doubt that it will turn out to be that crude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Daniel Tammet's ability to multiply seems to be mediated by a shape-memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pathway.  My (admittedly vague) guess would be that he somehow got the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shape memory part of his system to encode the math algorithms for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiplication, so that he can feed in the numbers as shapes and get them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back as a new shape, corresponding to the product. I would be interested to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know what he has been doing all these years, and whether he can perform 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;many other types of mathematical operations.
</em><br>
<p><p>I think what it really comes down to is just a superior short term memory. 
<br>
For example, I can take any two digit number and calculate it to the fourth 
<br>
power (albeit far more slowly and error prone). I notice that I can maintain 
<br>
the algorithmic &quot;ultra-fluidity&quot; that he seems so proficient with in the 
<br>
numbers, however, as the size of the data sets necessary to remember grow, I 
<br>
have to continually &quot;break&quot; the ultra-fluid data manipulation in order to 
<br>
mentally repeat the data sets so that they remains unambiguous. So not only 
<br>
do we have to mentally implement the algorithm in such a way that the output 
<br>
is incrementally built from some input, but also it is necessary to remember 
<br>
the input and the output. The thing with savants, it appears, is that they 
<br>
have some particularly mental balance, in such a way that they can maintain 
<br>
the ultra-fluid flow of the mental algorithm, and the output and input can 
<br>
be remembed entirely unambigiously, without constantly repeating themselves.
<br>
<p>It sure would be nice to figure out how to do that, if it's not an 
<br>
unchangeable quality.
<br>
<p>I don't believe it is an unchangeable quality, because I have noticed that 
<br>
the ability for me to remember in such a manner is related to my particular 
<br>
state of mind. But I won't get into that right now.

<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Daniel claims that since the age of four, he has been able to do huge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mathematical calculations in his head. So the makers of this documentary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;put him to the test, asking him to calculate 37 raised to the power of 4. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;He completed this in less than a minute, giving the correct answer of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1,874,161&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Next he was asked to divide 13 by 97. This time the researchers had the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;answer to 32 decimal places&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;He is very gifted with words and speaks nine languages and claims to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;able to learn a new one in just seven days.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Daniel had his own surprise, in Oxford, England, he would recite the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;number Pi to 22,500 decimal places, in public in front of a team of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;invigilators to verify his accuracy&quot;

<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;Kim has a double photographic memory and can recall everything he has
