<p>I believe that the Simulation Argument is a philosophical argument rather than 
<br>
a belief.  The thing is, there appears to be no reasonable way to argue 
<br>
against it.  The nature of the entity initiating the simulation is not known, 
<br>
so any arguments based on morality are inevitably futile.  And it's also not 
<br>
known what the limitations could be in the external universe in which the 
<br>
simulation would be embedded.  So even arguments based around &quot;This looks 
<br>
like the kind of law you would expect in a simulation&quot; are unsound.
<br>
<p>Really, there doesn't seem to be any way to know how that penny will come 
<br>
down, and it looks likely to land in a hole, so we may never know whether 
<br>
it's heads or tails.
<br>
<p>The best argument I've ever heard is that we seem headed toward the kind of 
<br>
civilization that would build such a simulator, and the future is long.  
<br>
(I.e., a probability based argument.)  This isn't anything that one could 
<br>
reasonably make a decent choice on.
<br>
<p>It is rather like arguing over the nature of angels, but from the viewpoint of 
<br>
a theologician rather than from the viewpoint of one of the congregation.  
<br>
(And anyone who comes to a serious *!*BELIEF*!* about this is probably either 
<br>
whacko or not a singularitarian.  [One seriously believed argument is 
<br>
&quot;computers will never be that powerful&quot;, but I don't think any 
<br>
singularitarians invest much belief in that position.])
