<p>What of those who have trillions of dollars invested in the status quo, 
<br>
people with intrenched interests in having the world continue on exactly 
<br>
the way it's currently going? I am personally much more concerned that 
<br>
global governments and the industries that control them (and just to be 
<br>
clear, those interests are not pointed in the direction of the greater 
<br>
good or human advancement) are systematically shutting down the very 
<br>
structures required to take humanity to the next level. With the recent 
<br>
decision sealed by the new supreme court, Justice Alito espoused that 
<br>
&quot;Government employees cannot expect the right, or to have ability to 
<br>
practice the First Amendment...&quot; in effect government should be opaque 
<br>
to the public, and anyone who tries to penetrate that obfuscation, 
<br>
should be considered at least a security risk and possibly a terrorist.
<br>
<p>Before we can even begin to seriously address the critical conditions 
<br>
necessary to create any kind of transcendental AI or even a pervasive 
<br>
global technocracy, we may well first have to address the human 
<br>
propensity for totalitarianism, fascism, sociopathy, superstition and 
<br>
genocide. A world where only a tiny handful of obscenely weathy people, 
<br>
using the fruits of technology to enslave and control the greater masses 
<br>
will never achieve the end we envision or hope for... those in power 
<br>
will never allow a run-away intelligence to be born let alone exist. 
<br>
That would certainly be the beginning of the end of their control.
