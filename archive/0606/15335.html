<p>
Yudkowsky posed an urgent ethical challenge at the end of his Summit speech:
<br>
Work to bring on a Friendly Singularity, or enjoy the conference and return
<br>
to one's television.
<br>
<p>This brought to mind some fascinating pieces by Carl Sagan and Douglas
<br>
Hofstadter which I read during the 1980's. These two scientists are today
<br>
widely admired by Singularitarians for cross-disciplinary interests,
<br>
scientific creativity, and compelling exposition, as well as ideas directly
<br>
related to the Singularity; during the Cold War they wrote eloquently
<br>
(including some very interesting scientific arguments) on the ethical
<br>
mandate to work for nuclear disarmament.
<br>
<p>As Anissimov points out (in &quot;Who are Technological Singularity Activists?&quot;),
<br>
humanity first knowingly faced extinction during the Cold War. Scientists,
<br>
and especially nuclear scientists, were among the first to warn of the
<br>
danger, and then to actively work to avert it, just as computer specialists
<br>
are the most Singularity-aware today. Yet the species-death risk of that
<br>
scenario suddenly went way down. (Of course, many existential risks still
<br>
exist, including nuclear destruction.)
<br>
<p>Analogical arguments are always imperfect, but if the analogy holds, what
<br>
conclusions can we draw?
<br>
<p>1. Paradoxically, the most seemingly logical solution might actually make
<br>
the situation worse. Robert Aumann, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for
<br>
game-theory work developed partly to analyze the Cold War, has been quoted
<br>
as saying that &quot;peace was maintained because airplanes carrying nuclear
<br>
weapons were in the air 24 hours a day&quot;. Though I must, even in retrospect,
<br>
admire and support Dr. Rotblat over Dr. Strangelove, any reduction in the
<br>
MAD balance of terror might have actually *increased *the probability of
<br>
total nuclear war.
<br>
<p>2. Therefore, though I also admire and support those who work to avert
<br>
Singularity disaster and to bring a Friendly Singularity, an
<br>
uncertainty-weighted cost/benefit analysis based on this analogy suggests
<br>
that one need not devote time and money to the Friendly Singularity, just as
<br>
most people who supported human survival did not give resources to the
<br>
disarmament movement.
<br>
<p>Anissimov warns (in &quot;Who Cares About the Singularity?&quot;) against responding
<br>
to the Singularity simply as a fact about the future, rather than as a call
<br>
to action. Yet even Kurzweil has said (in The Singularity Is Near) that
<br>
since we cannot know how to create Friendliness, we should focus on
<br>
enhancing democracy, human rights, progress, and prosperity (good advice
<br>
back during the Cold War, too), and hope for the best.
<br>
<p>Inaction based on this sort of uncertainly could be all too common, even
<br>
among people whom the Singularitarian movement might want as supporters. How
<br>
might Singularitarianism deal with this?
<br>
