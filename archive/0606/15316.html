<p>
Your email is full of characterizations and rather low on specific
<br>
claims. You say there is a vast &quot;Outer Darkness&quot; of &quot;insoluble
<br>
problems&quot;. That progress has been &quot;negligible&quot;. That people have
<br>
conjectured the impossibility of solving 'most' of them(for &quot;decades&quot;,
<br>
no less). That there is a large group of people convinced that there
<br>
isn't a prevalence of nonlinear systems, and that these people ignore
<br>
'massive' evidence to the contrary.
<br>
<p>I don't like fuzzy characterizations, and I especially don't like
<br>
anonymized attacks. Are you claiming that the SL4 list imagines the
<br>
world is a linear place? Did you think that the statement &quot;most claims
<br>
of impossibility usually turn out to be unreliable&quot; applied largely to
<br>
mathematical claims of intractability(which it doesn't, as far as I
<br>
can tell, it refers to specific technological achievement, deriving
<br>
from the older quote &quot;If a respected elder scientist says something is
<br>
possible, he is very likely right, if he says something is impossible,
<br>
he is very likely wrong&quot;, deriving from older embarassing anecdotes
<br>
about Lord Kelvin, who was very prone to declarative statements.)
<br>
<p>In short, your email is very passionate, but fails to persuade on the
<br>
account of it containing no facts and no specific claims.
<br>
<p>And this last:

</em><br>
<p>This is an example of reasoning that many have about science which is
<br>
absolutely wrong. There is no such thing as a conspiracy of scientists
<br>
keeping new science or technology down. They don't care about you,
<br>
what you do, or what you think. The vast majority of scientists
<br>
believe, in an abstract way, that diversity of research is a good
<br>
thing, and they might even applaud you, while privately thinking your
<br>
research is doomed to failure. What they won't do, is be convinced, or
<br>
give you money.
<br>
<p>That does not constitute a stranglehold. You are still free to do
<br>
whatever you want. In fact, the majority of interesting AI work in the
<br>
last few years has been outside of academia anyway (with a few shining
<br>
exceptions, like AIXI), so that particularly speaks against your ideas
<br>
of &quot;strangleholds&quot; and consensus opinion.
<br>
<p>The opinion of other scientists does not affect how your experiments
<br>
turn out. I'm sorry you don't like what most scientists are doing, so
<br>
what?
