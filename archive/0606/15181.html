<p>I am sorry to say I don't understand the basis of your complaint against my 
<br>
post.
<br>
<p>&quot;The dire reality is that reproduction cannot be unlimited in a limited 
<br>
world--so we go *SNIP* to cat gonads.  This is good from the moral 
<br>
viewpoint of a substantial majority of humans.&quot;
<br>
<p>(I should correct the above to a substantial fraction of western culture 
<br>
members.)
<br>
<p>My point was that more intelligent AIs or upgraded humans may have a 
<br>
different view of what is moral as we have a different view of what is 
<br>
moral compared to cats.  If you upgraded a cat to human level intelligence 
<br>
would it think controlling the population of regular cats the way we do was 
<br>
moral?  (I have no idea.)
<br>
<p>I certainly had no intent to prove Friendlyness impossible either.  I would 
<br>
be more inclined to attempt to prove it possible or even likely.  But I do 
<br>
think Friendly AIs will have to make some hard decisions if unmodified 
<br>
humans remain in the world--analogous to the decisions we make about cats 
<br>
and for the same reason.
<br>
<p>I think you may be objecting to my word use.   The word &quot;solved&quot; (in 
<br>
quotes) was in the literary device sense i.e., for the story.  I make no 
<br>
claims at all about this being a solution for the real world outside the story.
<br>
<p>Though it does have the flavor of what we do with cats . . . .

<br>
<p>PS.  If the list snippers clip it, we should move this to the extopy-chat 
<br>
list.  In preparation I will cc that list.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I &quot;solved&quot; this problem in the fiction I have been writing by putting

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;simulations and no food production by the AIs outside the simulations.

<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And the simulations were so attractive compared to the real world that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the big problem was getting enough people to have children in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;physical world to keep up a remnant population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
