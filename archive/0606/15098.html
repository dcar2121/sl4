</em><br>
<p>Like all human psychological traits, they have an evolved origin.  Even the 
<br>
triggers for genocide can be understood by looking to the recurrent 
<br>
conditions that periodically occurred in our hunter gatherer past.
<br>
<p>But discussion in this area skates near the edge where the thread snippers 
<br>
cut it off.  Unfortunately, I don't know of a place on the net where the 
<br>
underlying subject, evolutionary psychology, can be discussed with 
<br>
knowledgeable participants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;A world where only a tiny handful of obscenely weathy people, using the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Your last statement is certainly true, and not just for the obscenely 
<br>
wealthy.  But the previous statement,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &quot;those in power will never allow a run-away intelligence to be born let 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone exist.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>assumes that people have more predictive power than they do.  Our minds 
<br>
were shaped to be good at reproductive success in a stone age 
<br>
environment.  The obscenely wealthy are no better at predicting the outcome 
<br>
of ascendant AI then the rest of us.
<br>
<p>A while back I posted a chapter from a book I have been working on that 
<br>
described medical AIs storing bodies and uploading the entire population of 
<br>
Africa.  The chapter's function in the larger story is to explain what 
<br>
happened to the physical world population--which at the time of the story 
<br>
is very nearly gone.
<br>
<p>There was no discussion at all about the material so I don't know if the 
<br>
implication of a program to improve the lot of 3rd world countries was 
<br>
noted.  (It was so well adapted to fulfilling human needs that it got out 
<br>
of control and the same thing inadvertently happened to the rest of the world.)
