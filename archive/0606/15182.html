<p>Darwin went gallivanting around the world for more than ten years, 
<br>
observing how different turtle species on nearby islands looked 
<br>
suspiciously similar, before he had an insight that, in theory, 
<br>
Pythagoras could have had sitting in his living room.  It goes to say 
<br>
something about how awful humans are at collating their evidence and 
<br>
searching the space of simple hypotheses.  The history of natural 
<br>
selection is hardly a triumph for pure logic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same is true of Newton.
</em><br>
<p>If humans had been logically omniscient, or had any decent search 
<br>
capability through the space of small programs, the first human to watch 
<br>
an apple fall would have understood.  They had all the evidence a 
<br>
Solomonoff induction engine would have needed, right then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gallileo's belief about equal free-fall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; velocities and his ballistics theories are basically simply assertions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an unappreciated null hypothesis,
</em><br>
<p>A null hypothesis which he only reached after painstakingly observing 
<br>
cylinders rolling down a slide and timing their exact distances 
<br>
traversed using a water clock, which was the only clock accurate enough 
<br>
for his purposes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as is the more recent work of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Judith Rich Harris.   Even Einstein's general theory of relativity is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguably of this type.
</em><br>
<p>Einstein's general theory of relativity is the *only* case I can think 
<br>
of for non-experiment-driven revolutionary science.  Which is why I 
<br>
sometimes use the analogy:  &quot;Imagine that you had to develop a complex 
<br>
application of general relativity before anyone anywhere developed a 
<br>
simple application of special relativity.  Don't ask whether that would 
<br>
be easy or convenient, because obviously it wouldn't be.  But if the 
<br>
life of the entire human species depended on it, could it be done?&quot;
