My response to a statement on imminst
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.imminst.org/forum/index.php?s=&amp;act=ST&amp;f=75&amp;t=10834&amp;st=20#entry113511">http://www.imminst.org/forum/index.php?s=&amp;act=ST&amp;f=75&amp;t=10834&amp;st=20#entry113511</a><br>
<p><p>The problem comes down to what we make the AI desire. Humans desire sex, 
<br>
food, truth, social standing, beauty, etc. An AI might desire none of these 
<br>
things (except most certainly truth), and yet still be capable of general, 
<br>
human level, adaptable intelligence. It wouldn't need any of the human 
<br>
instincts indiginous to our body (although probably will be some overlap 
<br>
with intuitional (i.e. creative) instincts).
<br>
<p>Because of this *inconcievably* large array of possibilities, almost any 
<br>
analogy that we implicitly use in order to make some extrapolation on to 
<br>
what we think it will actually do are extremely unreliable (let alone the 
<br>
explicit ones).
<br>
<p>This is because the actual implementation is in the hands of the 
<br>
programmers. Whatever exact desires that they seed this Really Powerful 
<br>
Optimization Process with, it's going to explode into something completely 
<br>
beyond our current comprehension. You can't predict what someone smarter 
<br>
than you can, let alone will, do, especially if you don't have a technical 
<br>
understanding of it's desires.
<br>
<p>Lastly, if it has some desire, we can predict with strong confidence that it 
<br>
will obtain those desires, irrespective of any actions taken by humans to 
<br>
counter act this. Imagine if you were playing someone in chess, that was 
<br>
way, way smarter than you. You can't predict what they will do, because they 
<br>
are simply better chess players. No matter how smart you are, how clever you 
<br>
are, how much experience, preparation, and security you try to &quot;Box&quot; the AI 
<br>
with, you can predict with strong confidence it will overcome all of it (for 
<br>
reasons of it's exponentially increasing effectiveness of it's source code- 
<br>
which is the AI, which modifies the source code, etc)
<br>
<p>The only reliable measure of confidence you have in a safe, effective 
<br>
Singularity, is the level to which you can mathematically verify confidence 
<br>
in the Friendliness of the *first* AGI *before* it is implemented.
