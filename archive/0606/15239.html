</em><br>
<p>It seems to me it would be better to say that there is no absolute or
<br>
objective good-bad because  evaluation of goodness is necessarily
<br>
relative to the subjective values of some agency.
<br>
<p>Goals are not prerequisite to an assessment of goodness, but values
<br>
are.  Values are the reference, the standard of comparision by which
<br>
an assessment may be made.  Values may be somewhat transparent as are
<br>
those which are instinctive or those which are culturally
<br>
indoctrinated, or values may be relatively visible within the
<br>
awareness of the agent. Let me know if you require specific examples
<br>
to elucidate or support this claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and that those who believe that there is some absolute morality
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; human goals.
</em><br>
<p>I can think of other reasons why people could be mistaken on this
<br>
point, but this may be nit-picking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, the first three axioms:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Axiom 1.  Volition actualization/wish fulfillment is good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Axiom 2.  Each separate/individual volition/wish is of equal value
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Axiom 3.  There is no other inherent good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>At this point I would like to propose a somewhat different metaethical
<br>
foundation that I think may be useful, providing at least some
<br>
contrast, if not clarity, in the ensuing discussion.
<br>
<p>1. Goodness is always assessed relative to the values of a subjective agency.
<br>
<p>2. Any agency will assess as increasingly good those actions which
<br>
increasingly promote its values into the future.
<br>
<p>3. &quot;Good&quot; actions will be assessed as increasingly moral as they are
<br>
seen to work over increasing scope of agency, types of interaction and
<br>
duration.
<br>
<p>The practical implications of this reasoning are that increasing
<br>
awareness of (1) what works (increasingly objective
<br>
scientific/instrumental knowledge), applied to increasing awareness of
<br>
(2) our increasingly shared subjective values, leads to increasingly
<br>
effective social decision-making that is seen as increasingly good
<br>
(moral.)
<br>
<p>Therefore, we can and should rationally agree to promote the common
<br>
good via a framework supporting  increasing awareness of (1) and (2)
<br>
above.
<br>
<p>Mark, I'm looking forward to your thoughts (so far) as we proceed
<br>
toward increased understanding of the &quot;goodness&quot; that underlies all
<br>
intentional decision-making.
