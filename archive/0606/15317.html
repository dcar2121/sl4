</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That does not constitute a stranglehold. You are still free to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever you want. In fact, the majority of interesting AI work in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last few years has been outside of academia anyway (with a few shining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceptions, like AIXI), so that particularly speaks against your ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;strangleholds&quot; and consensus opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The opinion of other scientists does not affect how your experiments

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what?
</em><br>
You are right, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.
<br>
<p>It's been said that if the only tool you have is a hammer,  everything
<br>
looks like a nail.  This isn't *literally* true, but still it expresses
<br>
a deep truth.  So does Richard Loosermore.  It's not a literal
<br>
stranglehold ... but it's not far from it.  There's no force involved,
<br>
but the tools are what they are, and nothing that they aren't adapted to
<br>
is easy to deal with.
<br>
<p>The problem here is that to pick the easy problems first may be the only
<br>
way to make progress...but that means that each increment of progress
<br>
will be progressively more difficult.  Sorry.  If most problems are
<br>
NP-hard, then they probably WON'T get solved, except for the very
<br>
simplest cases.  
<br>
<p>OTOH, consider the difference between an optimal way to pack a knapsack
<br>
and a &quot;good enough&quot; way.  Frequently it's far better to search for a
<br>
&quot;good enough&quot; solution (for some definition of &quot;good enough&quot;).  And, in
<br>
fact, that's what most programming is about.  Very few programs are
<br>
about finding the optimal solution to a problem, but only about finding
<br>
a &quot;good enough&quot; solution.  The tricky part is error handling.  If you
<br>
can't predict exactly what something is going to decide, how do you trap
<br>
errors (for some good definition of error)?  If perfection is
<br>
impractical, how do you make something &quot;good enough&quot;, and how do you
<br>
define it?  (Remember that define, at its basis, means to put a fence
<br>
around.)
<br>
<p>Heuristics are all well and good, but to get to intelligence your model
<br>
needs to include itself within it.  (Not terribly difficult, but it
<br>
introduces self-referential cycles into the code...which does terrible
<br>
things to proofs.)  And you need heuristics on the generation of new
<br>
heuristics...including meta-level heuristics.  (Hermes Trismegistos
<br>
answered that one:  As above, so below.  The model is self-similar, if
<br>
not strictly fractal.)  This allows your model to become as complex as
<br>
needed, within the limits set by your computer power...but it makes it
<br>
quite difficult to predict.  But how should you control allowing changes
<br>
in heuristics computed at a lower level to propagate upwards to a higher
<br>
level?  My answer to this is &quot;built in instincts&quot;, unfortunately, the
<br>
form that those instincts must be composed in is a quite abstract one,
<br>
which needs to be adaptable to ALL levels of the hierarchy, including
<br>
those which have no knowledge outside of their immediate sensors. 
<br>
(Well...that true of all levels, but I meant sensor as in &quot;photocells or
<br>
photocell emulators&quot;, though generally by the time it reaches the
<br>
program a truer name for it is byte-stream.  But from an
<br>
external-to-the-program source rather than from an internal source.)
<br>
<p>OTOH:
<br>
1)  I haven't been able to define a satisfactory set of instincts
<br>
2)  I've been told by people who should know that my approach is to
<br>
simplistic to ever be general.  (Well, I'm softening their comment.)
<br>
3)  Even with the limitations that I've adopted some preliminary
<br>
calculations indicate that I'm going to need a much bigger hard disk,
<br>
more ram, and some way of splitting the program between processors (and,
<br>
of course, more processors).
<br>
<p>As you can tell, I'm not very far along.
