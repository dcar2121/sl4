John K. Clark:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sooner or later Mr. Jupiter Brain will find a way to  overcome the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; comically puny chains the incredibly stupid humans have placed on  it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; when it does I wouldn't be one bit surprised if it is filled with  titanic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rage.
</em><br>
<p>First of all, why would this thing feel rage if this emotion was never programmed 
<br>
into it in the first place? AI would have to write a &quot;rage program&quot; first before it 
<br>
could experience rage. The question is, why would it decide to write such a thing? 
<br>
Assuming this thing was friendly, it shouldn't have the motive to include the type 
<br>
of code that could lead to unfriendliness. Just because SAI *could* do something, 
<br>
doesn't mean it *would,* as Eliezer's recent papers point out.
<br>
<p>In the end, AI might still turn unfriendly, but probably not for the reasons you 
<br>
imagine.
<br>
<p>H.
