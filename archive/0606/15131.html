<p>
I don't think this has been raised before, the only similar suggestion
<br>
is that we should start by understanding systems that might be weak
<br>
and then convert it to a strong system rather than aiming for weakness
<br>
that is hard to convert to a strong system.
<br>
<p>Caveats:
<br>
<p>I don't believe strong self-improvement is at all likely, but I shall
<br>
treat it as if it were possible for the purposes of this post.
<br>
<p><p>The currently accepted best method for achieving a first Friendly
<br>
Strongly improving system (FSIS) is simply to have teams trying to
<br>
build it. I would like to present a slightly contrarian view that to
<br>
make the first strongly improving system Friendly, it could actually
<br>
be better to start a research effort to build a weakly improving
<br>
system in public and think about strong systems in private.
<br>
<p><p>First as a prelude, I shall write something about the relative
<br>
difficulties of each type of system. Strong systems are hard or at
<br>
least from the evidence from nature less probable than weak systems,
<br>
else it would be likely that evolution would have found one by
<br>
accident as it was searching through chimps, dolphins and humans and
<br>
other optimisation processes. In a similar vein a weak system should
<br>
be easy, as it seems more probable and we have a number of different
<br>
examples of weak systems in nature to use as rough guidelines. Also it
<br>
is generally thought of as easier or roughly as easy to build an
<br>
unfriendly system than a friendly strong system, else there would be
<br>
less need to discuss Friendliness.
<br>
<p>Currently we are at a stage equal orders of magnitude of resources are
<br>
going into weak and strong general intelligence research and a lot
<br>
less into friendly.Assuming that the amount of resources going into
<br>
each strand of research has some positive relation to the likely date
<br>
of that strands completion. Now the ideal would be to decrease the
<br>
amount of resources going into strong or pontentially strong
<br>
unfriendly research and increase the amount going into Friendly
<br>
research. Why might concentrating on weak systems, to start with at
<br>
least, do that?
<br>
<p>The first reason is that it would initially reduce the amount of
<br>
resources going into strong systems. By creating a solid and promising
<br>
research agenda focused on weak systems it would draw those people
<br>
interested in optimisation processes and lure them on an easy path
<br>
away from the very dangerous strong systems. Currently people are
<br>
scattered all over the space of optimisation processes, focussing on
<br>
weak ones should lead to a local minima, as it has with humans, that
<br>
will be hard to escape from.
<br>
<p>The second reason to start off weak is that experience is the very
<br>
good teacher of humans. As humanity built and interacted with weak
<br>
systems they would get experience with non-human optimisation
<br>
processes and so those interested in optimisation processes would be
<br>
less likely to commit the anthropomorphic error. Also it is likely
<br>
that we would have a fair amount of trouble with poorly defined weak
<br>
systems, which may inspire people to show more caution when attempting
<br>
to create stronger systems. In all they would see the dangers of
<br>
stronger system as a lot more real and probable, and so increase the
<br>
amount of effort to make their systems Friendly, if they went onto
<br>
create strong systems.
<br>
<p>To make a weak system we would need to analyse why the human brain is
<br>
weak (possibly due to decentralised control and decentralised changes
<br>
on decentralised hardware) and implement a similar system in silicon.
<br>
This would not be in software, so that we can be sure that sub goal
<br>
stomp cannot completely rewrite the system and lead to strongness.
<br>
<p>People can assume that I have decided to focus on the weak option if
<br>
they see my writings elsewhere.
