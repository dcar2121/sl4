My understanding is that most readers, myself included, have wished for 
<br>
more sniping rather than less.  Sometimes my target selection cues are 
<br>
obvious, as in cases of political, religious, or flamewar content.  
<br>
Sometimes I'm cued in by my Spidey-Senses.  The latter has posed a 
<br>
problem, as I've been hesitant to snipe threads and people where I can't 
<br>
exactly put my finger on why exactly I don't the discussion is meeting 
<br>
SL4's nose-bleedingly high standard of excellence.  After all, it could 
<br>
be that I simply disagree with the argumentative trends, and am 
<br>
subconsciously, Ouija-style, sliding the crosshairs according to my own 
<br>
biases.
<br>
<p>I've been reassured by my commanding officer that I should not allow 
<br>
such reservations to keep my finger off the trigger.  Indeed!  Quality 
<br>
(capital 'Q') is a slippery beast, and if I could define it precisely I 
<br>
would be wearing less camo and more tweed.
<br>
<p>So if I decline to tag my kills on occasion, you can assume it was a 
<br>
Quality problem that I am unable or unwilling to cruft up the archives 
<br>
by trying to explain.  This job is dirty enough as it is.
