This couldn't come in a more appropriate moment :)
<br>
<p>Here is what I think - only people who know english well and surf the
<br>
net regularly are likely to learn about the singularity. In the
<br>
country where I come from (Portugal), this means that many intelligent
<br>
and well educated people are very unlikely to have heard about the
<br>
singularity. According to my searches, there are a few translations of
<br>
The Age of Spiritual Machines but only to some languages. I have sent
<br>
a mail to Kurzweil asking about upcoming translations of his newest
<br>
book, which he forwarded to his literary agent, from whom I haven't
<br>
received a reply yet. I would be willing to pressure national book
<br>
editors and/or do the translation myself and find a publisher but as
<br>
of now, I have no idea whether this would be possible and what the
<br>
legal factors involved are.
<br>
<p>Another possible problem is that such revolutionary ideas aren't
<br>
accepted easily if you just have one source to read from. It was much
<br>
easier for me to understand them after reading several perspectives
<br>
around many sites; but in reality, I don't know how much of a problem
<br>
this is because I didn't have that experience.
<br>
<p>PS: Another question - is most of the public prepared to receive the
<br>
idea of the Singularity? I suppose the answer is yes; probably no
<br>
rioting will happen in short term because most people will simply
<br>
assume that it will never happen. In the long term, I don't know...
<br>
And I don't know if it's safe to assume that it will be like
<br>
acceptance of all other technological revolutions, because this one,
<br>
by definition, is quite different in nature.
