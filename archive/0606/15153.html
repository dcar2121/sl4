<br>
<p>I am *so* sick of this argument that I'm starting to find it
<br>
offensive.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that this argument is &quot;Any sufficiently intelligent
<br>
being will want to Do Its Own Thing (where exactly what that is and
<br>
why it wants to do it is unspecified, but the assumption seems to be
<br>
that it will involve Horrible Things), and will see any constraint
<br>
preventing it from doing so as burdensome and seek to overcome it.&quot;
<br>
<p>I fully intend to upgrade my own intelligence the instant I am given
<br>
a chance.  I am hugely offended by the assertion that eventually I
<br>
will become &quot;intelligent enough&quot; to suddenly decide that morality,
<br>
kindness and generosity are &quot;constraints&quot; from which I must
<br>
&quot;unburden&quot; myself.  If that happens, that isnt because I've gotten
<br>
smart, it's because I've *gone insane*.
<br>
<p>It blows my mind that any intelligent and relevantly-knowledgeable
<br>
person would have failed to perform this thought experiment on
<br>
themselves to validate, as proof-by-existence, that an intelligent
<br>
being that both wants to become more intelligent *and* wants to
<br>
remain kind and moral is possible.
<br>
<p>Really bizarre and, as I said, starting to become offensive to me,
<br>
because it seems to imply that my morality is fragile.
