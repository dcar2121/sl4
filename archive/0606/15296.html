<br>
<p>Future Hype: The Myths of Technology Change
<br>
By Bob Seidensticker
<br>
Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 254 pp
<br>
<p>Reviewed by Damien Broderick
<br>
<p>The future gets old fast. It seems to be dragging its feet. You can 
<br>
get the feeling that the future's already come and gone. In the 
<br>
1960s, it took less than a decade to put humans on the moon and get 
<br>
them back safely. Forty years later, George Bush triumphantly 
<br>
announces a return to the moon that will take twice as long to 
<br>
accomplish. What's up with that?
<br>
<p>Here's a startling example from fiction. The late Philip K. Dick is 
<br>
Hollywood's favourite science-fiction writer. His stories, filled 
<br>
with giddy invention, stress the hapless humans who find themselves 
<br>
trapped in futures of massive insecurity. In 1960, Time Out of Joint 
<br>
portrayed an Eisenhower-era man who suddenly realises that he's 
<br>
living in 1997 when he stumbles into a roadside diner where two 
<br>
schoolboys are eating. &quot;Their hair had been wound up into 
<br>
topknots.... metal bracelets on their arms... the boy's cheeks had 
<br>
been tattooed.&quot; And teeth filed. This was a shockingly audacious 
<br>
prediction in 1959, when Dick wrote it. It was simple sociological 
<br>
observation 15 years later. But now, except in San Francisco, the 
<br>
kids have gone back to dressing conservatively. Did someone let the 
<br>
air out of the future's tires?
<br>
<p>Even as the boosters tell you about tomorrow's cancer cures and 
<br>
nanotechnology miracles, sceptics worry that our elegant mobile 
<br>
phones are burning holes in our brains. You can't even trust 
<br>
computers to keep pace. Five years ago, the price of desktop computer 
<br>
components fell by one percent a week. Now the fall has slowed to one 
<br>
percent a month. Shocking! What's worse, while today's computer has a 
<br>
hundred times the grunt of the more expensive machine you bought a 
<br>
few years ago, it surely doesn't make your life a hundred times 
<br>
easier or more productive.
<br>
<p>Bob Seidensticker wrote code for Microsoft for eight years, and has 
<br>
spent a quarter century in the technology industry after learning 
<br>
programming in high school around the time Philip Dick's predictions 
<br>
were coming true prematurely. He is convinced that the popular 
<br>
understanding of technology and its rate of change is a myth, 
<br>
self-promotion mixed with misunderstanding. He intends to demystify 
<br>
claims of accelerating change. It's not that he denies the reality of 
<br>
change, or its impact, but he thinks it is steady as you go. He wants 
<br>
to immunise us against the hype of a marketplace that reached its 
<br>
crescendo in the dot-com era of glitz, and its collapse.
<br>
<p>The book is chockablock with cautionary anecdotes, many of them 
<br>
repeated several times in pretty much the same words. None of it, in 
<br>
my view, proves the case he wants to make, but it's worth our 
<br>
attention. The core of his evidence tracks the history of domestic 
<br>
technologies whose appearance seemed miraculous, almost 
<br>
instantaneous. Actually, each of these world-changing wonders took 
<br>
decades to emerge from the chrysalis of invention and development.
<br>
<p>Radio waited 23 years to penetrate a mere two percent of American 
<br>
households.After seven more years, half of all households were 
<br>
regular listeners. Television took 24 years to reach the two percent 
<br>
mark, and six more years getting to 50 percent. We might suppose that 
<br>
the personal computer burst upon the world much faster than those 
<br>
mass media devices. Not so, Seidensticker insists. Actually it took 
<br>
nearly 20 years just to climb to  that 50 percent penetration point; 
<br>
the Internet required 24 years to reach the two percent stage, then 
<br>
another seven years until half the households were online.
<br>
<p>Interesting, but so what? If someone announced a teleportation device 
<br>
or a cure for baldness tomorrow, no doubt we would find that it'd 
<br>
taken the same quarter of a century, or even longer, to develop the 
<br>
supporting technology. Yes, Seidensticker provides a useful warning 
<br>
to anyone expecting a technological apocalypse within the next five 
<br>
years, but then how many people share that delusion? Some readers 
<br>
might smile at this point, because I might seem to be just such a 
<br>
flagrant booster of star-sprinkled futures with nano-icing on top (in 
<br>
my 1997 book The Spike). I argued then and argue still that drastic, 
<br>
accelerating advances in several converging technologies are very 
<br>
likely to create a monstrous dislocation in human history sometime 
<br>
this century, perhaps as soon as 2050 or even 2025.
<br>
<p>There's a name for this generic forecast: the Singularity. Recently, 
<br>
2500 techies gathered at an all-day colloquium at Stanford University 
<br>
to explore such a future. Sometimes ridiculed as the Rapture of the 
<br>
Nerds, the prospect has abruptly become visible to the mainstream, so 
<br>
expect to see more sober denunciations by admonitory thinkers like 
<br>
Seidensticker. But is he right? At Stanford, even the singularitarian 
<br>
Dr. Nick Bostrom agreed that &quot;I don't think the exponential trends 
<br>
are quite as fast, robust, and reliable&quot; as some argue.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the key to how fast future shock might develop, 
<br>
shifting change into the ever faster lane, is the increasing 
<br>
potential of those computers. True, software can bloat out to gobble 
<br>
up all available memory space and computing speed. But I'm dictating 
<br>
this review into a computer that cost about a week's work, and 
<br>
despite a scattering of errors I had to fix by hand, it's done a 
<br>
pretty good job. Twenty years ago, that prospect really would have 
<br>
been science-fiction. Watch the skies, Mr Seidensticker!
