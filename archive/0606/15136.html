<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Once upon a time there was a race of pan-dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hyperbeings who had  almost nothing in the way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; emotions or feelings:  all they had was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; vague, listless urge to build things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [....] just listless creativity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I presume these &quot;vague and listless&quot; feelings were good enough for these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyper beings to build wonderful things, otherwise they just wouldn't be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting; but if so I don't see what's so vague and listless about them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if these creatures have engaged in some extraordinarily creative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior how did you determine it was listless?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; no sense of humor, no shame or sorrow or love propensity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to giggle or  appreciation for the finer things in life like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; chocolate muffins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have heard this fallacy before and I believe it happens when people watch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much Star Trek, certainly popular entertainment loves to pontificate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the inherent superiority that meat has over silicon. But the truth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions are easy, inevitable even. Emotions are not what makes us unique,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animals have had them for hundreds of millions of years, intelligence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what makes us human.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To explore the moral question of enslaving a mind more powerful than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself a little, suppose rather than friendly computers we use genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering to make a friendly race. The Friendly race look just like human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings except they are a bit more beautiful, they have a boiling water IQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they are incapable of disobeying any order given by a human being and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always placed human well being over his own. Would you be comfortable with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or suppose the beef producers reasoned that it was more moral to eat an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal that wanted to be eaten than one that did not; so they engineered a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cow that wanted to be eaten and was intelligent enough to tell you. Like in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe the cow would come to your table
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and talk about what parts of his body would be the tastiest, and then when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you made your order it would blow its brains out. Would you be comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the moral question is academic because there is not a snowball's chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in hell of outsmarting something a thousand times smarter than you and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets even smarter every day.
