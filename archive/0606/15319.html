<p>You may be mistaking fuzziness in your own understanding of the issues 
<br>
for fuzziness in the issues themselves.  If Stephen Strogatz could 
<br>
understand these points well enough to write about them in his book, and 
<br>
if he has not yet lost his job or his status as a world-class 
<br>
mathematician specializing in nonlinear systems, and if I repeat them 
<br>
here, applied to AGI issues, then it begins to look like the points I 
<br>
made actually have a great deal of depth, whereas your criticism 
<br>
contains nothing that indicates understanding, only complaints.
<br>
<p><p><p>Are you claiming that the SL4 list imagines the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I can't think of anything more vague and fuzzy than the idiotic quote 
<br>
about elder scientists.  I am not operating at that level, I am talking 
<br>
about deep methodological issues.  I wouldn't dream of wasting my time 
<br>
on debating whether or not old scientists talk garbage.

<p>It replied to Michael Vassar's pointer to a debate:  read the

background.  In that context (and even if you don't understand the

broader context), it makes sense.

</em><br>

<em>&gt; This is an example of reasoning that many have about science which is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Oh, please:  let's keep &quot;conspiracy&quot; talk out of this.  I didn't say or 
<br>
imply anything about conspiracies, so it would helpe if you didn't put 
<br>
words into my mouth.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; They don't care about you,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe, in an abstract way, that diversity of research is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing, and they might even applaud you, while privately thinking your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research is doomed to failure. What they won't do, is be convinced, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give you money.
</em><br>
<p>This is a ridiculously naive view of what science is actually like.  Get 
<br>
out there and talk to some real scientists about biasses and funding 
<br>
bandwagons and prejudices and power centers.  Or, if you can't do that, 
<br>
read some books by people who study how science works.  Failing that, at 
<br>
least don't say anything about it.
<br>
<p>You could trying to read about the role played by Behaviorists in the 
<br>
psychology community.  That situation is closely analogous to the 
<br>
present situation in AI.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; That does not constitute a stranglehold. You are still free to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever you want. In fact, the majority of interesting AI work in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last few years has been outside of academia anyway (with a few shining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exceptions, like AIXI), so that particularly speaks against your ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;strangleholds&quot; and consensus opinion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The opinion of other scientists does not affect how your experiments
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It would have been nicer if, anywhere in your message, you had addressed 
<br>
a single, solitary grain of the issues I raised, or asked questions to 
<br>
clarify some aspect of what I said, so you could go further and talk 
<br>
about the issues.
<br>
<p>The fact that you did not, but instead just complained about nebulous 
<br>
faults that you imagined you saw, is part of the collective abdication 
<br>
of scientific responsibility I was talking about in the first place: 
<br>
you avoided the issue.
