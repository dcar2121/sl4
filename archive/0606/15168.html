<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Again, you are using the word &quot;control&quot; where it simply does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; not apply.  No-one is &quot;controlling&quot; my behaviour to cause it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; be moral and kind; I choose that for myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Alas,  you are but one evolutionary agent testing the behavior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; space. I believe that humans are generally good, but with 6
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; billion of them, there's a lot of crime.  Do we plan on building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one AI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the argument is that with runaway recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; self-improvement, any hardcoded nugget approaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; insignificance/obsolesence.  Is there a code that you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; write that nobody, no matter how many trillions of times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; smarter, couldn't find a workaround?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can we all agree on the following points, then:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Any attempts to put crude (aka simple or &quot;hardcoded&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints on the behavior of an AGI are simply pointless,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because if the AGI is intelligent enough to be an AGI at all, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it is allowed to self-improve, then it would be foolish of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think that it would be (a) aware of the existence of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints, and yet (b) unable to do anything about them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) Nevertheless, it could be designed in such a way that it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not particularly feel the need to do anything about its overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design parameters, if those were such as to bias it towards a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular type of behavior.  In other words, just because it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed with a certain behavioral bias, that doesn't mean that as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon as it realizes this, it will feel compelled to slough it off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (let alone feel angry and resentful about it).
</em><br>
<p>I agree with both those points, yes.  Well put, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I tried to make these points when I first started writing to this list a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year ago, and the way I did it was by referring to what is known of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design [sic] of the human mind.  I am fairly sure that evolution has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed me with a set of fairly vague &quot;motivations&quot;, some of which are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nurturing or cooperative (to speak very loosely) and some of which are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggressive and competitive.  I know also that the former [thankfully] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are far more dominant over the latter.  In particular, I feel an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational affection and attachment to loved ones, and to a broad 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectrum of the world's population.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yet, even though I *know* that this is a design feature of my system 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (something that I am just as compelled to do as Lorenz's ducks were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compelled to imprint on him) and even though I expect one day to be able 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see the exact mechanism that causes this, I feel not even slightly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compelled to overthrow it, or to be resentful of it.
</em><br>
<p>*Precisely*.  Thanks.
<br>
<p>-Robin
