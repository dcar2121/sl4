<p>
Michael,
<br>
<p>About Lamarckian evolution...
<br>
<p>In fact there is a lot of recent evidence that the &quot;central dogma&quot; of
<br>
molecular biology (as Francis Crick called it) [the lack of
<br>
significant information transfer from the environment back into the
<br>
genetic material during the lifespan of an organism] is worked around
<br>
in interesting ways, in real biological systems.
<br>
<p>Back in the 80s, Cairns et al argued based on some experiments with
<br>
bacteria that there is significant transfer of information back into
<br>
the genetic material based on the environmental experience of the
<br>
organism.  They talked about &quot;directed mutation.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, it seems that  this phenomenon could possibly be explained by
<br>
judicious environmental effects on mutation rate, thus remaining
<br>
basically consistent with the central dogma
<br>

<br>
<p>There is a bunch of more recent work following up this theme, though I
<br>
don't have the references handy....
<br>
<p>So, yeah, Lamarck's simple ideas were wrong, but the underlying
<br>
concept does appear to have some truth to it, in subtle ways.
<br>
Something which is being discovered via EXPERIMENT, obviously, not by
<br>
armchair theorizing....
<br>
<p>Armchair theorizing should be able to tell you that both Darwinian and
<br>
Lamarckian evolution are possible, as well as various complex
<br>
combinations thereof....  But exploring which combinations are used in
<br>
nature is obviously a matter of experiment...
