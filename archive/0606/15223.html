<p><em> &gt; Though it does have the flavor of what we do with cats . . . .
</em><br>
<p>Some time ago I spent a few weeks with an old lady who has cats.  (She 
<br>
wasn't much older than me, but I will be 64 this year.)
<br>
<p>She had 10 or maybe it was 11 cats--you never saw them all at once.  They 
<br>
were (now) all indoor cats--prisoners for the sake of safety.  About half 
<br>
of them were feral cats.  They had been trapped, neutered or spayed many 
<br>
years ago and confined indoors.  They approached to beg tasty food but ran 
<br>
if anyone tried to pet them.  The cats were getting old, two of them were 
<br>
over 20.
<br>
<p>She loves her cats and dotes on them.  When I was there they were taken 
<br>
care of about as well as we would take care of aging humans.  One of them 
<br>
had had his colon removed and while he could use a litter box he did not 
<br>
(hard on rugs).  That one looked particularly awful but seemed reasonably 
<br>
active for an old cat and not in pain.
<br>
<p>Some of them had to be chased down and caught every day because they were 
<br>
getting daily injections and one of them was getting fluid under the 
<br>
skin.  Her vet bill runs to $15k a year; a cancer operation on one of them 
<br>
cost several thousand dollars (the effort did not extend the cat's life).
<br>
<p>One of the best sets of books on space colonies is _The Revolution From 
<br>
Rosinante_ trilogy by Alexis A. Gilliland.  The trilogy is also perhaps the 
<br>
first to use the concept of incorporation to give an AI legal rights.  Two 
<br>
of the AIs (one was trained up by a religious nut) used his/her deep 
<br>
knowledge of human psychology to create and impose a new religion in the 
<br>
space colonies for political reasons that was both consistent with known 
<br>
science and deeply appealed to the &quot;reptile brain&quot; in us.
<br>
<p>Near the end of the last book, one of the AI is talking about the symbiotic 
<br>
relation that was developing between AIs and humans.  I don't have a copy 
<br>
out right now, but from memory the AI characterized it as &quot;Like cats.  You 
<br>
live in *their* house and take care of them.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am not going to try to draw morals from this set of data (some of it from 
<br>
a fictional source) but I know for certain that I would not like to be one 
<br>
of her cats.
<br>
<p>Of course an AI taking care of humans could always mess with their brains 
<br>
to make them feel content.  If this makes you shudder now, don't worry, you 
<br>
won't feel that way after you have been &quot;adjusted.&quot;
<br>
<p>With megadeath from wars right around the corner, as nasty and ugly as the 
<br>
future now looks without the singularity, it could be worse with it.
<br>
<p>Keith Henson
<br>
<p>PS  I suspect my libertarian leanings extend even to pets.  If an animal 
<br>
wants to be a pet, that's fine, but I am not inclined to keep one locked up.
