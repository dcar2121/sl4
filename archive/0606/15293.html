Concept is pretty simple. You develop really powerful analytical/debugging 
<br>
applications that can display the entire contents of the AI mind in 
<br>
tractable and useful visual representations and extrapolations into future 
<br>
states of the mind.
<br>
<p>Strategy:
<br>
Let the AI 'sleep' (i.e. down-time) long enough to periodically analyze the 
<br>
entire contents of the mind. The point in the analysis is to isolate areas 
<br>
of potential risk/danger and either directly modify/secure these areas, or 
<br>
to instruct the AI via it's communication channel with the programmers (and 
<br>
obviously check up on the AI's obediance).
<br>
<p>Theoertically, the only window for danger would be in the period it is awake 
<br>
and thinking. It would need to come to several conclusions simultaneously 
<br>
that all affirmed some non-Friendly behavior, and develop that intention 
<br>
into a non-Friendly action before it went to sleep.
<br>
<p>A strategy to combat this possibility would be to develop dynamic 
<br>
diaognostic software, that could actively monitor the entire range of the 
<br>
AI's mental and external actions. A comprehensive security system would need 
<br>
to be developed to set alerts, automatic shut downs, security warnings, and 
<br>
anything abnormal or potentially remarkeable.
<br>
<p>The point of implementing this strategy is to allow a non-verifiably 
<br>
Friendly AGI to help the programmers and mathematicians developing 
<br>
Friendliness theory in a relatively safe and reliable manner.
<br>
