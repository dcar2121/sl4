</em><br>
<p>Not really.  'Religious fanatics' believe they already have all the  
<br>
answers as laid down in their dogma and sacred text.  Those answers  
<br>
may already include things like this world being but illusion and  
<br>
perfect happiness beyond the grave, what is required to partake of  
<br>
this condition, something already in place of FAI called God, Allah  
<br>
or whatever.   Any sort of human effort toward Singularity is at best  
<br>
seen as a waste of time by this sort and at worst as a great  
<br>
blasphemy.   There is no common cause with this type as a type. There  
<br>
may be with the more liberal religious sorts but only to the degree  
<br>
that they are free of such dogma.  So I presume they are not part of  
<br>
'religious fanatics' for the purpose of this discussion.
<br>
<p>The economic/political/military powers that be will be for this to  
<br>
the degree that it extends or cements their power and position  
<br>
relative to others.  Beyond this they will be for it only as we are  
<br>
all for it.   As economic/political/military  powers they will look  
<br>
at in terms of their own relative advantage.
<br>
<p>Everyday people can be reached to the degree they can be convinced  
<br>
that Singularity and the attendant  technological buildup will be of  
<br>
great benefit to themselves, their loved ones and to humanity.   At  
<br>
the least they would need to be convinced this is the best hope.    
<br>
All of the above are connected at this level.
<br>
<p>As for dialog,  I doubt that there is  enough commonality and shared  
<br>
rationality to get all these groups to the table effectively.
