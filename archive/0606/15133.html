<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once upon a time there was a race of pan-dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyperbeings who had  almost nothing in the way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotions or feelings:  all they had was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vague, listless urge to build things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [....] just listless creativity
</em><br>
<p>I presume these &quot;vague and listless&quot; feelings were good enough for these
<br>
hyper beings to build wonderful things, otherwise they just wouldn't be very
<br>
interesting; but if so I don't see what's so vague and listless about them.
<br>
And if these creatures have engaged in some extraordinarily creative
<br>
behavior how did you determine it was listless?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; no sense of humor, no shame or sorrow or love propensity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to giggle or  appreciation for the finer things in life like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chocolate muffins.
</em><br>
<p>I have heard this fallacy before and I believe it happens when people watch
<br>
too much Star Trek, certainly popular entertainment loves to pontificate
<br>
about the inherent superiority that meat has over silicon. But the truth is
<br>
emotions are easy, inevitable even. Emotions are not what makes us unique,
<br>
animals have had them for hundreds of millions of years, intelligence is
<br>
what makes us human.
<br>
<p>To explore the moral question of enslaving a mind more powerful than
<br>
yourself a little, suppose rather than friendly computers we use genetic
<br>
engineering to make a friendly race. The Friendly race look just like human
<br>
beings except they are a bit more beautiful, they have a boiling water IQ
<br>
and they are incapable of disobeying any order given by a human being and
<br>
always placed human well being over his own. Would you be comfortable with
<br>
that?
<br>
<p>Or suppose the beef producers reasoned that it was more moral to eat an
<br>
animal that wanted to be eaten than one that did not; so they engineered a
<br>
cow that wanted to be eaten and was intelligent enough to tell you. Like in
<br>
The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe the cow would come to your table
<br>
and talk about what parts of his body would be the tastiest, and then when
<br>
you made your order it would blow its brains out. Would you be comfortable
<br>
with that?
<br>
<p>But the moral question is academic because there is not a snowball's chance
<br>
in hell of outsmarting something a thousand times smarter than you and that
<br>
gets even smarter every day.
