</em><br>
<p>The Proactionary Principle is a putative optimum strategy for progress
<br>
within an inherently risky and uncertain environment.  How do you
<br>
reconcile your belief in abandoning a strategy, not because the
<br>
problem definition has changed, but because your feelings about the
<br>
risk change past some threshold of problem scope?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The mistake I made in 1996, when I thought any SI would automatically be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly, was a very bad mistake because it meant I didn't have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devote further thought to the problem.  The mistake I made in 2001 was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as much a mistake, but it was a mistake that got me to spend much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more time thinking about the problem and study related fields and hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself to a higher standard.
</em><br>
<p>I think you'll eventually reach a higher level of understanding and
<br>
leave behind the noble but unattainable dream of saving humanity, and
<br>
will refocus your considerable talents toward the even nobler and
<br>
realistic dream of maximizing the growth of human values that work
<br>
over increasing scope, while acknowledging that there will always be
<br>
risk.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; although it sounds absurd, you *should* be able to know in advance what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can and can't predict, and test those predictions you dare make, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use that same strict standard to predict the AI will be Friendly.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be able to win in that way if you can win at all, which is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point of the requirement.
</em><br>
<p>Your writing indicates that you're aware that you are presuming your
<br>
desired conclusion.  You have begun to qualify your statements with
<br>
&quot;if you can win at all&quot;, and that's a crucial &quot;if&quot;.  Maybe it's time
<br>
to go back and take another look at the economics of Pascal's Wager.
<br>
<p>While I understand you appreciate direct criticism -- Crocker's Rules
<br>
and all -- I do also want to say that I support your efforts, have
<br>
always admired your integrity, and am increasingly impressed with the
<br>
quality of your public presentations.  You're championing an important
<br>
line of thought.
<br>
<p>- Jef
