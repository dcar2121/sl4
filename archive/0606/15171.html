<p>Analogy is always suspect, but consider cats.  We treat them as morally as 
<br>
we can.
<br>
<p>The dire reality is that reproduction cannot be unlimited in a limited 
<br>
world--so we go *SNIP* to cat gonads.  This is good from the moral 
<br>
viewpoint of a substantial majority of humans.
<br>
<p>But I have my doubts about how the cats feel about it.  At least it is my 
<br>
observation that intact cats have more interesting personalities.
<br>
<p>I &quot;solved&quot; this problem in the fiction I have been writing by putting rules 
<br>
on the AIs that they would analyze as being such a good idea they would not 
<br>
want to do otherwise.  Namely, no reproduction inside uploaded simulations 
<br>
and no food production by the AIs outside the simulations.
<br>
<p>And the simulations were so attractive compared to the real world that the 
<br>
big problem was getting enough people to have children in the physical 
<br>
world to keep up a remnant population.
<br>
<p>(The AIs were constructed without the desire to reproduce and were only 
<br>
brought into existence by physical state humans.)
