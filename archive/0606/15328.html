</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Falsifiable predictions are not the issue, and I think you know that:  I 
<br>
have said before (very clearly) that this is a question at the paradigm 
<br>
level.
<br>
<p>You have read enough that I am sure I do not need to educate you on the 
<br>
difference between paradigm-level issues and normal-science issues.
<br>
<p>If this were a debate about particular results within a science, your 
<br>
request for falsifiable predictions would be justified.  But because you 
<br>
*know* full well that I have made my statements at the paradigm level 
<br>
--  in other words, for people who might be reading this and do not know 
<br>
what I mean by that, I am attacking the foundational assumptions and the 
<br>
methodology of the mainstream AI approach  --  your request for a bold 
<br>
precise, flasifiable prediction is specious.
<br>
<p>[I have said this in the past, and if I recall correctly all I got in 
<br>
reply was a dismissive comment that said something like &quot;when someone 
<br>
doesn't have anything concrete to say, of course they always trot out 
<br>
the &quot;paradigm&quot; excuse&quot;.  I sincerely hope this does not happen again.]
<br>
<p>Now, we could go one of two ways at this point:
<br>
<p>1)  I could back up a little and pretend that you do not know this, and 
<br>
explain to you exactly why your request for a falsifiable prediction is 
<br>
without merit.  I am happy to do this, but I would find it tedious 
<br>
because I have always assumed that you were sophisticated enough to know 
<br>
the difference.
<br>
<p>2)  I could go straight on to the real issues (this is my preferred 
<br>
option), but I can only do this if you explicitly accept that the 
<br>
argument must take place at the paradigm level, taking a look at the 
<br>
problems of the entire approach to AI that you espouse.
<br>
<p>So:  please choose.  Would you put aside the &quot;falsifiable predictions&quot; 
<br>
request and promise not to reintroduce it, so we can discuss the real 
<br>
issues?
<br>
<p>Let me know:  I am happy to proceed with the next step, according to 
<br>
which of the two options you choose.
<br>
<p>**********
<br>
<p>An aside to Russell Wallace:  I hear what you say, and for the record I 
<br>
have made quite strenous efforts to explain my position, but whenever I 
<br>
start to put a lot of effort into it, I get blindsided by exactly the 
<br>
kind of negative reaction that I referred to (in other words, sarcastic 
<br>
dismissals).  If anyone wants to discuss the matter maturely, I am 
<br>
always ready to explain at great length:  as you know, I am not shy 
<br>
about writing.
<br>
<p>If anyone thinks that anything I am saying is not clear they should 
<br>
address *particular* points that seem to lack clarity, so that between 
<br>
us we can home in what needs clarification.  What I cannot deal with is 
<br>
the kind of mindless, kneejerk response that copies my entire post and 
<br>
sprinkles it with &quot;This is all just stupid, fuzzy thinking&quot;.
<br>
<p>As I have said before, there are plenty of people out there who 
<br>
understand these issues well enough that they would look at what I write 
<br>
and say &quot;This is clear as daylight&quot;.   The fact that they do not belong 
<br>
to this list, or they belong, but only contact me in private, seems to 
<br>
convince some people on the list, who do not understand what I write, 
<br>
that the fault is all mine, and it gives them license to open up and be 
<br>
abusive and dismissive.  It is not my job to educate anyone who can't be 
<br>
bothered to check they own knowledge level before they open their mouths.
<br>
<p>I look forward to writing about the actual issues in the next post, 
<br>
according to which way Eliezer prefers to take it.
<br>
