<p>&nbsp;From reading this, It looks like you hold evolution in extremely  
<br>
high regard. Such high regard that you can't see any of the huge  
<br>
limits that it has. But wait...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Natural selections sucks, it's an idiotic way to produce complex

</em><br>
<p>So, why are you so certain that the reason evolution hasn't come up  
<br>
with a certain kind of mind before is that creating such a mind is  
<br>
impossible? Natural selection obviously has vast potential for  
<br>
diversity even from what we know has happened on Earth alone, but I'm  
<br>
willing to bet this diversity is a pittance compared to what kinds of  
<br>
minds *could* be created. Natural selection produces organisms which  
<br>
are built to survive, and it appears that the easiest route to  
<br>
survival for organisms with minds (who are living in a world of other  
<br>
organism-with-minds) is to give them all of the apparent &quot;selfness&quot;  
<br>
and so forth that we take for granted.
<br>
<p>You say that making the kind of mind Eliezer is talking about is &quot;far  
<br>
far harder&quot; than making a mind like ours. I don't know why one would  
<br>
assume that either kind of mind would be harder to make than the  
<br>
other. I suppose I do have a hunch that a mind with &quot;no subjective  
<br>
experience&quot; (at all, whatsoever) will turn out to be an oxymoron, but  
<br>
I don't think that has much bearing on the ethical issue as long as  
<br>
there were no sense of self or personal dignity for us to feel guilty  
<br>
about mucking around with.
<br>
