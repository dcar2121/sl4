Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; FAI is a genuinely new problem, and it requires new science. Was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of evolution created by a community &quot;getting off its butt and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; building consensus&quot;? How about special relativity? Thermodynamics?
</em><br>
<p>FAI involves science, mathematics and philosophy (ethics) mixed together.
<br>
<p>Special relativity and thermodynamics are IMO not particularly good comparables.
<br>
<p>I happen to agree with you that consensus-building is not going to be
<br>
effective at cracking the FAI problem, but I do feel that collective
<br>
discussion may be useful.  BUT, collective discussions on the topic on
<br>
this list have become quite dull in recent years due to the excessive
<br>
repetition of a handful of speculative points of view (including my
<br>
own ;-).  What would be nice would be to have more creative, diverse
<br>
brainstorming on the topic by a variety of different thoughtful
<br>
people....  That might lead to the generation of new ideas that would
<br>
spur someone to create new, relevant science and mathematics....
<br>
(Hey, one can always hope!!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can't do good science by firing off quick e-mails and agreeing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. You have to think. You should probably think by yourself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because when human beings form groups, they stop thinking and start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politicking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My recommendation is to spend some time learning existing science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics. Maybe then you'll be in a position to develop new science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are plenty of people who never will learn any science. Fine, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't have to listen to them. Why care about consensus?
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm....  Knowing Mark Waser (the person you're replying to) F2F, I
<br>
happen to know that he does know plenty of science and mathematics and
<br>
has built a variety of AI systems for commercial deployment over the
<br>
last 20 years.  He also has spent plenty of time thinking by himself.
<br>
My opinion is that Mark is definitely in a position intellectually to
<br>
create important new science, although he seems to be very busy with
<br>
commercial work these days.  I'm not sure why you assume that he is an
<br>
ignorant and non-thoughtful person just because he is interested in
<br>
consensus-building!!!  ;-)
<br>
