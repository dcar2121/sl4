Shouldn't list-snipers have been on this thread from Loosemore's first post?

<em>&gt;Ah, another Monday morning coming back to mischaracterizations:

<em>&gt;&gt;You may be mistaking fuzziness in your own understanding of the issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for fuzziness in the issues themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lets be clear here. You had a quote by Strogatz, where he quotes Ulam
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explaining that there are a lot of nonlinear systems. Then you went on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for two paragraphs about 'vast' areas and 'tiny piles of analytically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tractable systems' and &quot;Outer Darkness&quot; You characterize this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation as a very obvious and important divide between linear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nonlinear systems. You do, of course, neglect to reference anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more than a quote of a casual quote, mention any specific claims of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intractability, or reference any &quot;impossible&quot; problems that have stood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the &quot;centuries&quot; you're broadly painting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's what I mean by fuzziness. If you /mean/ something specific,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then by all means correct me. As far as I can tell, your point thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;far in your first two paragraphs and subsequent responses is to assert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there are lots and lots of nonlinear systems, most of which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insoluble, and that all of mathematics (and presumably other sciences)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has resulted in very little progress in this space, on the basis of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quote and a lot of adjectives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;If Stephen Strogatz could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;understand these points well enough to write about them in his book, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;if he has not yet lost his job or his status as a world-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mathematician specializing in nonlinear systems, and if I repeat them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;here, applied to AGI issues, then it begins to look like the points I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;made actually have a great deal of depth, whereas your criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;contains nothing that indicates understanding, only complaints.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, a well respected author is evidence for some depth in a debate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;somewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Are you claiming that the SL4 list imagines the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; world is a linear place? Did you think that the statement &quot;most claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; of impossibility usually turn out to be unreliable&quot; applied largely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; mathematical claims of intractability(which it doesn't, as far as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; can tell, it refers to specific technological achievement, deriving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; from the older quote &quot;If a respected elder scientist says something is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; possible, he is very likely right, if he says something is impossible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; he is very likely wrong&quot;, deriving from older embarassing anecdotes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; about Lord Kelvin, who was very prone to declarative statements.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I can't think of anything more vague and fuzzy than the idiotic quote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about elder scientists.  I am not operating at that level, I am talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about deep methodological issues.  I wouldn't dream of wasting my time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;on debating whether or not old scientists talk garbage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is nice. Respond to the sub note, it's the most important part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this paragraph. Do you have an answer to either question? To me, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems like you're twisting the definition of 'impossibility' (and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applicability of the quote) to make a vague point about the big and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scary world of Complex systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Who are you talking about? What are you accusing them of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Oh, please:  let's keep &quot;conspiracy&quot; talk out of this.  I didn't say or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;imply anything about conspiracies, so it would helpe if you didn't put
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;words into my mouth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You are accusing unknown persons of having a 'stranglehold' on 'AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research'. I'll use a different word if it makes you feel better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This is a ridiculously naive view of what science is actually like.  Get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;out there and talk to some real scientists about biasses and funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;bandwagons and prejudices and power centers.  Or, if you can't do that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;read some books by people who study how science works.  Failing that, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;least don't say anything about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What 'view' would you say that paragraph was espousing? Did I claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any mechanism or make, in fact, any claims about 'what science is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually like'? All I said was that scientists don't care about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you do. And have no motivation to interfere with your work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;You could trying to read about the role played by Behaviorists in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;psychology community.  That situation is closely analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;present situation in AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Luckily, I've already been interested in psychology a long time, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;am familiar with the dominance of the Behaviorist model. It's true
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a lot of good research didn't get done because it did not fit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Behaviorist paradigm. Unfortunately for your point, a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists continued with what they were doing anyway, on their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tenure, or in private research, or even outside established science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's why psychology has moved on. Certainly if the majority view is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'wrong', and that view is being taught to students, then less people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be doing science the 'right' way. That's not an active force
</em><br>
<em>&gt;preventing anything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It would have been nicer if, anywhere in your message, you had addressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a single, solitary grain of the issues I raised, or asked questions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;clarify some aspect of what I said, so you could go further and talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about the issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I objected to your argument on the grounds that you weren't making any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concrete points, and challenged you to make some specific claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's a valid criticism, under whatever philosophy of science you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;follow. Also, I asked three questions, although the last was partly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rhetorical:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you claiming that the SL4 list imagines the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world is a linear place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Did you think that the statement &quot;most claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of impossibility usually turn out to be unreliable&quot; applied largely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical claims of intractability?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm sorry you don't like what most scientists are doing, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The fact that you did not, but instead just complained about nebulous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;faults that you imagined you saw, is part of the collective abdication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of scientific responsibility I was talking about in the first place:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;you avoided the issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You filled an email with unspecific adjective-laden sentences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accusing unnamed persons of being self-deluded, of obstructing AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research, of not recognizing some grand truth about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incomprehensibility of the world. I felt that you were sniping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunistically, writing without specific claims, making dramatic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;points without support. I don't have a case to prove, you do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you think all AI research is missing something, what is that? You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refuse to specifically point to errors or approaches, or make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific predictions. You write about what stupid, naive, blinded folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we are, and are aggravated when someone points out that you are just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asserting so with big words. I don't even have a clear idea who or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what theories or community you are slandering, only that they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;holding back all progress. So, by induction, since I think I'm making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progress, and part of 'the establishment' by virtue of having a job in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI, I assume I must be part of the problem. So, where to begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correcting my many faults?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What, in fact, is your issue that I'm avoiding?
</em><br>
