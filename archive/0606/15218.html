Hi everyone.  As many here surely already know, the least competent 
<br>
individuals are often also least capable of accurately assessing their own 
<br>
abilities and as a result believe themselves to be among the most competent.
<br>

<p>I think that this may create problems for a list of this sort.
<br>
<p>The official standards for posting on SL4 are sufficiently high that well 
<br>
over 90% of posters probably don't qualify to post here.  An unfortunate 
<br>
consequence of this may be that while the competent, rational, and fairly 
<br>
modest and busy posters who haven't read through the whole archives are kept 
<br>
out, the overconfident and incompetent are selectively admitted.
<br>
<p>I recently found a dramatic example of this in the form of a SL4 lurker I 
<br>
discovered through my recruitment activities in meatspace who appears to be 
<br>
more actively rational than the vast majority of SL4 posters.  That I did 
<br>
this implies that SL4 is not even succeeding at the goal of bringing SL4 
<br>
people to one-another's attention.
<br>
<p>In order to remedy this, I have a request for all you lurkers out there.
<br>
If you don't think that what you have to say meets the standards of SL4, but 
<br>
you aren't sure, want to help, think you might have some good ideas, or 
<br>
whatever, please Write to Me, at this address (michaelvassar at 
<br>
hotmail.com).  If you aren't sure that you are competent, but you think you 
<br>
might be I can spend my time trying to help rather than letting you clutter 
<br>
the list.  This way hopefully we can have both fewer useless posts AND fewer 
<br>
wasted opportunities or ignored insights.
<br>
<p>Socrates claimed that only the wise know that they know nothing
<br>
Ben Franklin said &quot;it is better to keep quiet and be thought a fool than to 
<br>
speak and remove all doubt&quot;
<br>
but
<br>
we don't want to screen out Socrates and Franklin while letting in the crazy 
<br>
guy from the street-corner who spends his time screaming that he's Jesus.
