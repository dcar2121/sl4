<p>Well, in that case you (and Scott Aaronson) seem to be harboring an 
<br>
irrational bias of precisely the sort complained of so often by the 
<br>
Rationalists:  a selection bias.
<br>
<p>*Most* claims of impossibility usually turn out to be unreliable?
<br>
<p>What about the impossibility of finding tractable, analytic, 
<br>
non-experimental solutions to nonlinear systems and (by extension) 
<br>
self-organizing systems?
<br>
<p>In his book &quot;Sync&quot; Stephen Strogatz says:
<br>
<p>&quot;The mathematician Stanislaw Ulam once said that calling a problem 
<br>
nonlinear was like going to the zoo and talking about all the 
<br>
interesting non-elephant animals you see there.  His point was that most 
<br>
animals are not elephants, and most equations are not linear.  [...] In 
<br>
any situation where the whole is not equal to the sum of the parts, 
<br>
where things are cooperating or competing, not just adding up their 
<br>
separate contributions, you can be sure that nonlinearity is present. 
<br>
Biology uses it everywhere.  Our nervous system is built from nonlinear 
<br>
components.  [...] And human psychology is absolutely nonlinear. [...] 
<br>
Every major unsolved problem in science, from consciousness to cancer to 
<br>
the collective craziness of the economy, is nonlinear.&quot;
<br>
<p>The space of systems (by which I mean equations, systems of equations, 
<br>
and the larger algorithmic entities that are usually just called 
<br>
&quot;systems&quot;) is a vast space, and in one tiny corner of that space you 
<br>
will find an embarrassingly small little pile of analytically tractable 
<br>
systems - and this little pile is virtually ALL of mathematics.  Outside 
<br>
of this little corner, there is nothing but darkness:  and we conjecture 
<br>
(we have intuitions) that there will never be tractable analytic 
<br>
solutions to *most* of the contents of that Outer Darkness.  We have 
<br>
conjectured this for decades, if not centuries, and so far our 
<br>
conjecture has turned out to be rock-solid, because the amount of 
<br>
progress that has been made in converting those intractable problems 
<br>
into tractable ones has been unthinkably negligible.
<br>
<p>If you believe, and if Eliezer believes, that &quot;most claims of 
<br>
impossibility usually turn out to be unreliable&quot; then you have to 
<br>
include in your count this enormous space of unsolvable systems (which, 
<br>
as Strogatz points out, includes systems that self-organize, with 
<br>
elements that compete and cooperate ... like for example, intelligent 
<br>
systems), and by that count you are completely wrong.  Most of those 
<br>
systems are still not analytically soluble.
<br>
<p>You are so flagrantly wrong, in fact, that it is difficult to understand 
<br>
how any rational person could make that statement, unless they were the 
<br>
victim of a monstrous form of selection bias:  chosing the evidence to 
<br>
support their prior belief, and ignoring a massive body of evidence that 
<br>
disconfirms that prior belief.
<br>
<p>I believe this self-delusion is what is precisely what is happening. 
<br>
There is a large community of people who collectively agree to not look 
<br>
at that embarrassing fact about the prevalence of nonlinearity, and when 
<br>
a community of people pull the wool over their own eyes like that, they 
<br>
eventually convince themselves that black is white and white is black 
<br>
and they are telling the truth to themselves.  Collective delusion.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't care so much, except that these people have a stranglehold on 
<br>
Artificial Intelligence research.  This is the real reason why AI 
<br>
research has been dead in the water these last few decades.
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.
