I know you dislike being quoted, but this is a little too much to let pass.

<p>On 6/27/06, Richard Loosemore &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20Offended%20Respondent%20WAS%20[META]%20Unconstructive%20remarks%20[WAS%20Re:%20analytical%20rigor]">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; wrote:

<em>&gt; If you cannot think of anything constructive to say on a topic, or if

</em><br>
<em>&gt; your peace and resist the temptation to make calculated, gratuitous insults.
</em><br>
<p>Your post that caught my attention, which Mr. Vassar is probably
<br>
referring to, contained a great deal of inflammatory language, which
<br>
is difficult to rationalize as constructive.
<br>
<p>In it, you claim that the Michael is &quot;...so flagrantly wrong, in fact,
<br>
that it is difficult to understand how any rational person could make
<br>
that statement&quot;, and that in fact the AI community at large is in a
<br>
situation where: &quot;... a community of people pull the wool over their
<br>
own eyes like that, they eventually convince themselves that black is
<br>
white and white is black and they are telling the truth to themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;Collective delusion.&quot;
<br>
<p>I personally have no problem with strong language, and allowed this to
<br>
set the tone of my emails as well. It is tiresome, though, to be
<br>
chided on this point, given the situation.
<br>
<p>If you want to call an entire community deluded, irrational, and make
<br>
very sweeping statements about science, mathematics, AI, and other
<br>
large topics, it rings very hollow when you then jump to complaining
<br>
about your opponents saying negative things about you.
<br>
<p>This is a pattern I see, wherein you make very strong statements, and
<br>
then when threatened or challenged, focus on the speaker, the terms of
<br>
the argument, some irrelevant subpoints of the speakers response...
<br>
anything , in fact, but what the main thrust of the argument is.
<br>
<p>Predictably, you chose to ignore my questions, and in an aside to
<br>
someone else characterize my response as &quot;mindless, kneejerk response
<br>
that copies my entire post and sprinkles it with &quot;This is all just
<br>
stupid, fuzzy thinking&quot;.&quot;  I'm sorry that I attempted to address your
<br>
missive in detail. If you read my comments, you'd note that I actually
<br>
did ask a few questions, and use a few more arguments than that.
<br>
<p>My annoyance at this avoidance can only be described as 'expected',
<br>
given our past exchanges. But I am curious, what is so difficult about
<br>
answering questions, or even just outlining your specific objections
<br>
or list the grand problems you reference as 'obvious' and 'clear as
<br>
day'? You say your theory predicts the failures of AI research. How?
<br>
What failures?
<br>
<p>I differ from Vassar and Eliezer in not believing that falsifiable
<br>
predictions are neccesary in order to engage in scientific discussion,
<br>
but I can't seem to get you to provide any grounds for a discussion.
<br>
<p>1. Your opening points were about nonlinearity, why is this an
<br>
indictment of any current AI theory? No current theory since the time
<br>
of SHRDLU has proposed that an AI could use a world-complete logical
<br>
system. The majority of AI technology currently in use is built on the
<br>
assumption of approximate solutions.
<br>
<p>2. You claim a theory or group has a stranglehold on AI research. Who
<br>
is this group, or what is that theory? As far as I can tell, AI
<br>
research occurs in an extremely heterogeneous fashion. In fact, I'm
<br>
hard-pressed, sometimes, to find ANY theoretical shared ground when
<br>
speaking to DARPA researchers I know. Finally and most interestingly,
<br>
how is this 'stranglehold' implemented? Why haven't I encountered it?
<br>
<p>3. Finally, your comments constantly imply that AI research is doomed
<br>
to failure if it doesn't recognize some essential fact. This fact has
<br>
seemingly changed as you've discussed it on SL4, or at least you are
<br>
describing it differently. Is there a positive component to your
<br>
thoughts, or are they largely analytic of extant theory? Is there some
<br>
capsule description of what or how AI research would have to change?
<br>
<p>I find myself constantly responding to your messages when I had
<br>
previously resolved not to, precisely because I've had no luck, and
<br>
seemingly neither has anyone else, at getting you to define what
<br>
you're actually talking about. It's frustrating, because on first
<br>
read, so many of your messages seem like you're referencing something
<br>
with significant internal complexity, but I don't know what it is.
