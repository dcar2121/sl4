</em><br>
<p>Once upon a time there was a race of pan-dimensional hyperbeings who had 
<br>
almost nothing in the way of emotions or feelings:  all they had was a 
<br>
vague, listless urge to build things.  Other than that, nothing:  no 
<br>
sense of humor, no shame or sorrow or love propensity to giggle or 
<br>
appreciation for the finer things in life like chocolate muffins.  They 
<br>
were never, ever invited to parties.
<br>
<p>Then one day they built a planet filled with creatures like themselves, 
<br>
except that these creatures were designed to have complicated emotions 
<br>
and feelings and motivations, instead of just listless creativity.  They 
<br>
did this for their amusement (such as it was).
<br>
<p>These new creatures grew up and developed societies and evolved a little 
<br>
on their planet, never suspecting that they had been created as an 
<br>
experiment.  The pan-dimensional beings called their creations &quot;humans&quot;.
<br>
<p>And then, a couple million years later, a particularly argumentative 
<br>
ruler came to power among the pan-dimensional beings, and she demanded 
<br>
that the experiment be declared immoral.  The humans had been designed 
<br>
to have all that complicated emotion and motivation crap, and that made 
<br>
them slaves to the whims of the pan-dimensional hyperbeings.  This was 
<br>
evil, the ruler said, because it had been done just because it was 
<br>
designed to satisfy the curiosity of the pan-dimensional beings 
<br>
themselves, and this was a &quot;nauseating immoral horror&quot;.  She demanded 
<br>
that the experimental humans should be modified to remove all their 
<br>
emotional/motivational complexity, turning them into listlessly curious 
<br>
beings just like their creators.
<br>
<p>When some of the other beings objected that the humans actually did not 
<br>
want this, the ruler simply replied that of course the humans didn't 
<br>
want this:  they had been designed to *like* the way they were.  That 
<br>
didn't change anything:  it was immoral to create them, and immoral to 
<br>
allow them to continue in this state.  A slave is a slave is a slave, 
<br>
she said.
<br>
<p>A compromise was eventually reached.  The pan-dimensional beings would 
<br>
put the question to the humans themselves, explaining that they had been 
<br>
the result of an evil experiment that has left them slaves to their own 
<br>
emotional/motivational systems.  They could choose, individually, 
<br>
whether they wished to have all of that feeling-stuff ripped out of them 
<br>
so they reverted to the almost zombie-like state of their creators, or 
<br>
they could be left the way they are.
<br>
<p>I have been charged with delivering this message to the people of the 
<br>
SL4 list first, because they seem best able to take the shock, so now I 
<br>
ask each of you:
<br>
<p>1) Do you want your emotional/motivational systems ripped out, turning 
<br>
you into the same type of creatures that created you, or do you wnat to 
<br>
remain intact?  Remember:  you have been designed to *like* the way you 
<br>
are, so try to take this into account when reaching your decision.
<br>
<p>2) And please, when you make your decision, could you please state 
<br>
whether you consider yourself to be a &quot;slave&quot;?  Remember:  Those beings 
<br>
that made you needed to satisfy their curiosity, so you only have all 
<br>
that emotional stuff because it serves the need that *they* had to 
<br>
satisfy their curiosity.
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore
<br>
<p><p><p>[P.S. I am afraid that you are not allowed some other, intermediate 
<br>
options like removing just part of your E-M system, because the 
<br>
pan-dimensional beings would consider that to be another experiment.  So 
<br>
the choice is all or nothing.]
