Intelligence
<br>
<p>When I was a child, and was thinking of Artificial Intelligence, as a
<br>
thinking entity. I always ended up, that it must be just a very simple
<br>
principle, an algorythm that, if applied on information, becomes an
<br>
aware entity.
<br>
<p>Recently I remembered my first dream in my life - to understand
<br>
everything. I understood before I had this dream, that the main
<br>
feeling I had was endless curiosity.
<br>
<p>Then I found that some people in the world also identified themslves
<br>
compared to others, as nothing more than curious people.
<br>
<p>At this point, I had thought of a hypothesis, that the ultimate goal
<br>
of any intelligence, as a &quot;thinking entity&quot;, is purely - to understand
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>Definition might be obscure, as the word &quot;to understand&quot; is obscure,
<br>
and even proposed as indefineable in Wikipedia, but I think it is
<br>
sufficient to create a computer program, which would do exactly that,
<br>
not necessarily being aware of that at the beginning.
<br>
<p>Presently, the definition of intelligence, that I am thinking of, is as follows:
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Passive intelligence is any entity that:
<br>
(three conditions for any intelligence)
<br>
<p>1. routinely performs comparisons of the streaming data from world
<br>
(environment) with the data from the memory,
<br>
2. routinely guesses (predicts) possible correlations in data by
<br>
empirically estimating functions, by
<br>
*  routinely intercomparing the data generated with these hypothetical
<br>
(guessed) functions and the streaming data from the world
<br>
3. identifies functions, which produce the data, as closer to the existing data.
<br>
<p>Active intelligence has another feature. It does:
<br>
(fourth condition for active intelligence)
<br>
<p>4. Try to change the world to get new data.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>Here I think all the parts are quite easy to realize except one - the
<br>
guessing mechanism...
<br>
but we have many mathematical extrapolation, and prediction methods in
<br>
contemporary mathematics.
<br>
<p>Generally, it should be one very simple and universal prediction
<br>
algorythm, which would recursively reuse the predicted functions to
<br>
make new guesses.
