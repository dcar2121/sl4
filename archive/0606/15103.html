</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone want to venture a guess on the public awareness of the

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Singularity in, say, 2010 or 2015?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the Singularity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; (1) remain the province of a few hundred or a few thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; super-technologically-aware types (like, e.g., hints of possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; for faster-than-light spaceflight today);
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; (2) or spread into the awareness of hundreds of thousands or millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; educated people (like, e.g. private space travel or nanotech today);
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; (3) or become a major social issue followed by tens or hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; millions (like, e.g., genetically engineered food or nuclear power today).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Any thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Joshua
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One way to acquire sufficient computational resources would be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;publish an on-line game (or community?  2nd Life?) in which much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computation was done by what is essentially voluntary participants in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bot-net.  This would be even better if the game could be so structured
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that portions of the game score depended on solving challenges that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those needed by the program's operation.  (Since these would be &quot;high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;level&quot; challenges, they should have high rewards attached to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There would, after all, be a large probability of failure.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Is this feasible?  ??  Is 2nd Life involved in such a scenario?  ??  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tend to think not.)  But do note that a lot of the time in these games
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the computer is essentially waiting for the user to react.  This time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;represents available CPU cycles that don't need to be merely discarded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Of course, with a lot of designs the OS already uses them for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;background processing.)
</em><br>
<p>Actually I was thinking of something more along the lines of a &quot;massively 
<br>
single-player&quot; game where users different reactions to a partially simulated, 
<br>
but mostly representational hard take-off would yeild different post-singular 
<br>
futures, so that the end-game is, to an extend, user created content. Then 
<br>
people could put this stuff up and compare notes and singularity awareness 
<br>
would generally improve for the better. The upcoming Spore might have the same 
<br>
effect on people's awarenss of xenobiology concepts.
<br>
<p>Second Life isn't really a challenge oriented user environment; the only real 
<br>
goals are aesthetic, with the result being a heterogeneous environment of user 
<br>
created content. Since a desirable post-singular future could probably be 
<br>
described as a heterogeneous environment of user created content, it makes 
<br>
sense to see a soft take-off being facilitated and &quot;padded&quot; by successive 
<br>
generations of such platforms. I don't know if designing a system that used 
<br>
human play to teach an AGI (if that's what you're getting at) is desirable or 
<br>
feasible. Its not feasible because if the virtual world doesn't have 
<br>
commercial entertianment appeal, you'll never get funding for it short of 
<br>
DARPA taking a very serious and creative stance on AGI, and its not 
<br>
nessecarily desirable because AGI pattern recognition isn't going to be mature 
<br>
enough to handle such an environment in early stages.
<br>
<p>Using a infra-human AGI to both direct and learn from such an environment as 
<br>
part of its sensory modality isn't a bad idea though, something to consider 
<br>
maybe five years down the line.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if Ben's optimism regarding parrallel hardware is accurate or 
<br>
not, but I don't think human support can make up for raw computation, but 
<br>
human support can aid pattern learning significantly.
