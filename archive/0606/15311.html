<p>There probably were some kind of limitations or human interactions thrown in. 
<br>
Maybe they got the car on the autobahn, got it going, then turned it over to 
<br>
computer control for a long straight stretch to see how fast it would go. I 
<br>
haven't really looked into it though. In this article Dickmanns is quoted in the 
<br>
mid-90's apparently saying that it would take more computer power to have a 
<br>
truly &quot;do it all by itself&quot; car:

<br>
<p>I think the first DARPA event failed mainly due to lack of testing and 
<br>
development by the teams involved on the kind of real world off-road course they 
<br>
had to face. Some got thrown by mechanical problems, most got thrown by their 
<br>
code not being able to deal with certain kinds of challenges that the off-road 
<br>
course had. With more experience they were able to refine their code to handle 
<br>
all the gotchas for the second event.
