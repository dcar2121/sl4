Perhaps I didn't express myself clearly enough.
<br>
<p>I was not raising the issue of whether the Cold War is analogous to the
<br>
negative Singularity scenario. I was interested in a meta-analysis of
<br>
certain arguments which might have been wrong, even when coming from the
<br>
clearest of thinkers and with the best logic.
<br>
<p>In other words, how would Singularitarianism respond to someone who thinks
<br>
as follows:
<br>
<p>&quot;Yudkowsky just gave an apparently impeccable argument in favor of working
<br>
against Singularity disaster. I guess I should give money to SIAI.
<br>
<p>&quot;But then again, back in the 1980's, Sagan and Hofstadter (who resemble
<br>
Yudkowsky in being advanced multidisciplinary, logical, ethical thinkers)
<br>
gave apparently impeccable arguments in favor of supporting the disarmament
<br>
movement, and it turned out that their positions may have not only been
<br>
wrong, but would have actually made the risk of extinction worse if
<br>
implementation had gotten underway.
<br>
<p>&quot;So, it seems that I can't simply trust what seems to me to be a flawless
<br>
logical argument from Yudkowsky, and I'd better not give money to SIAI, but
<br>
rather only do what Kurzweil suggests: keep myself alive, and maybe do my
<br>
little part to advance democracy, human rights, and technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>How would you respond to this? And remember, we're only human: Logic isn't
<br>
everything in convincing people. Even if the argument is logically wrong,
<br>
what do you say to such a potential supporter?
<br>
