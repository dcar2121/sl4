<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yudkowsky posed an urgent ethical challenge at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end of his Summit speech:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Work to bring on a Friendly Singularity, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoy the conference and return
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to one's television.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This brought to mind some fascinating pieces by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Carl Sagan and Douglas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hofstadter which I read during the 1980's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These two scientists are today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely admired by Singularitarians for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross-disciplinary interests,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific creativity, and compelling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exposition, as well as ideas directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to the Singularity; during the Cold War
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they wrote eloquently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (including some very interesting scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments) on the ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mandate to work for nuclear disarmament.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Anissimov points out (in &quot;Who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Technological Singularity Activists?&quot;),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity first knowingly faced extinction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during the Cold War. Scientists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and especially nuclear scientists, were among
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the first to warn of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger, and then to actively work to avert it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as computer specialists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the most Singularity-aware today. Yet the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; species-death risk of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario suddenly went way down. (Of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many existential risks still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist, including nuclear destruction.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Analogical arguments are always imperfect, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if the analogy holds, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions can we draw?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Paradoxically, the most seemingly logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution might actually make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the situation worse. Robert Aumann, who won the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobel Prize in Economics for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game-theory work developed partly to analyze
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Cold War, has been quoted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as saying that &quot;peace was maintained because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airplanes carrying nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons were in the air 24 hours a day&quot;. Though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must, even in retrospect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admire and support Dr. Rotblat over Dr.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strangelove, any reduction in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MAD balance of terror might have actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *increased *the probability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total nuclear war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Therefore, though I also admire and support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who work to avert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity disaster and to bring a Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty-weighted cost/benefit analysis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on this analogy suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one need not devote time and money to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly Singularity, just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people who supported human survival did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not give resources to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disarmament movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anissimov warns (in &quot;Who Cares About the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity?&quot;) against responding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Singularity simply as a fact about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, rather than as a call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to action. Yet even Kurzweil has said (in The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity Is Near) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since we cannot know how to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness, we should focus on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enhancing democracy, human rights, progress,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and prosperity (good advice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back during the Cold War, too), and hope for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inaction based on this sort of uncertainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be all too common, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among people whom the Singularitarian movement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might want as supporters. How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might Singularitarianism deal with this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joshua
</em><br>
<p>I reject that analogy; I believe Sagan and
<br>
Hofstadter were not wrong, but rather that we
<br>
were lucky they were not proven right (i.e.
<br>
sometimes someone warns you of a danger, and you
<br>
escape it not by heeding them but by dumb luck);
<br>
and that the history has been written by those
<br>
who opposed disarmament and have been in power
<br>
most of the intervening time. How lucky were we?
<br>
I refer you to 
<br>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Able_Archer</a>

<br>
<p>to draw your own conclusions.
