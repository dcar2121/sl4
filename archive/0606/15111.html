<p>If you mean that some groups have their continued or desired relative  
<br>
advantage firmly in mind then that is of course true.   Some begin to  
<br>
see their greatest advantage in the radical betterment of all or at  
<br>
least in radical change.   I doubt very much that many thinking  
<br>
persons fail to notice that the status quo has considerable downsides  
<br>
and threats even to their esteemed selves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am personally much more concerned that global governments and the  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industries that control them (and just to be clear, those interests  
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It is not at all clear that some of these groups are fundamentally  
<br>
pointed away from the direction of the greater good and human  
<br>
advancement.  Some of them have such as an explicit part of their  
<br>
charter.  Even many a corporation has a more or less 'good' model of  
<br>
what they are about.    I do not see where they are &quot;systematically  
<br>
shutting down the very structures required..&quot;.   I sometimes have  
<br>
this somewhat paranoid interpretation but I doubt it is the case.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; With the recent decision sealed by the new supreme court, Justice  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alito espoused that &quot;Government employees cannot expect the right,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or to have ability to practice the First Amendment...&quot; in effect  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government should be opaque to the public, and anyone who tries to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penetrate that obfuscation, should be considered at least a  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security risk and possibly a terrorist.
</em><br>
<p>This does not make the rather broad point above at all cleanly.   Yes  
<br>
this is a disgusting and dangerous ruling but its scope is much more  
<br>
provincial and limited than the above claims.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before we can even begin to seriously address the critical  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions necessary to create any kind of transcendental AI or  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even a pervasive global technocracy, we may well first have to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address the human propensity for totalitarianism, fascism,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociopathy, superstition and genocide.
</em><br>
<p>I doubt it very much.  Humans have been attempting to understand and  
<br>
address these thing in various ways using our limited human abilities  
<br>
for a very long time.  It is very doubtful that we limited humans can  
<br>
successfully &quot;address&quot; these things.  I certainly would not want to  
<br>
wait to achieve much higher intelligence likely needed to resolve  
<br>
such until we have already somehow muddled our way to a resolution.   
<br>
Such an attempt would all too likely  lead to our demise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A world where only a tiny handful of obscenely weathy people, using  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fruits of technology to enslave and control the greater masses  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never achieve the end we envision or hope for... those in  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power will never allow a run-away intelligence to be born let alone  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist. That would certainly be the beginning of the end of their  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control.
</em><br>
<p>A rant against relative wealth does not help.   Yes there is a strong  
<br>
possibility of using various evolving tech for very dystopian  
<br>
possibilities.   But we cannot remove all such possibilities *before*  
<br>
moving forward.   Those in power thrive on greater intelligence.    
<br>
They will aid its creation and at some point its control and  
<br>
consequences will allude their grasp.   You cannot end concentration  
<br>
of wealth and power before proceeding.  Some concentration of wealth  
<br>
and power are actually essential to some of the necessary progress.    
<br>
Telling which are essential and which are &quot;obscene&quot; is itself  
<br>
apparently beyond our capabilities.
