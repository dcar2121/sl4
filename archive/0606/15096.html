<p>Understood, but as I said before, I think it is spurious and misleading
<br>
to talk about upper bounds of this sort when we have absolutely no idea
<br>
whether it is necessary to duplicate the architecture down to the neuron
<br>
level.  And especially when some people in the field have reasons to
<br>
believe that the real requirements are several orders of magnitude more
<br>
modest.  [See below]
<br>
<p>I really don't mean to be so critical of your particular calculation,
<br>
but what usually happens after someone mentions these brain calculations 
<br>
is that a huge amount of effort and discussion time is invested in it, 
<br>
and before you know it everyone is talking in terms of putting dates on 
<br>
the arrival of AGI, on the basis of what computer power is needed to do 
<br>
it, or (even worse), potential investors are *citing* these calculations 
<br>
as evidence that they should not invest because we are not there yet.
<br>
<p><p>Richard Loosemore.
<br>
<p><p><p>P.S.  My Calculation
<br>
<p>Somebody is bound to ask, so here is a sketch of the basis for my own 
<br>
calculations.
<br>
<p>Approximate number of cortical columns:  1,000,000.  If each of these is 
<br>
hosting a single concept, but they are providing a facility for moving 
<br>
the concept from one column to the next in real time, to allow concepts 
<br>
to make transient connections to near neighbors, then most of them may 
<br>
be just available for liquidity purposes (imagine chinese puzzle on a 
<br>
large scale... more empty blocks means more potential for the blocks to 
<br>
move around, means greater liquidity).  So, number of simultaneously 
<br>
active processes:  perhaps as few as 10,000 (conservative estimate based 
<br>
on considerations that originate in the richness of the sensorium), not 
<br>
a million.
<br>
<p>Further suppose that the function of concepts, when active, is to engage 
<br>
in relatively simple interactions with neighbors in order to carry out 
<br>
multiple simultaneous relaxation along several dimensions.  When the 
<br>
concepts are not active they have to go through different sorts of 
<br>
calculations (debriefing after an episode of being used), and when they 
<br>
are being activated they have to (effectively) travel from their home 
<br>
column to where they are needed.  Considering these &quot;other&quot; computations 
<br>
together we notice that the function may implement multiple functions 
<br>
that do not need to be simultaneously active.
<br>
<p>Now, all of the above functions are consistent with the complexity and 
<br>
layout of the columns.  Notice that what is actually being computed is 
<br>
relatively simple, but because of the nature of the column wiring the 
<br>
functions take a good deal of wiring to implement the functions ... so 
<br>
the columns look computationally demanding but when implemented in 
<br>
silicon the functionality is not nearly as difficult.
<br>
<p>Finally, when implementing the 10,000 processes in silicon, take account 
<br>
of the relative clock speeds and you can probably simulate 100 to 1000 
<br>
processes simultaneously, if you use FPGA hardware (say, one the 
<br>
Celoxica boards that Hugo de Garis is making such good use of).  Depends 
<br>
on the complexity of the function, and on the bandwidth requirements. 
<br>
That gives you a computational requirement of between 10 and 100 desktop 
<br>
machines with one $6,000 FPGA card in each one.  Obviously that is just 
<br>
the cognitive core:  you'd need peripherals as well.  Assuming 100 
<br>
machines rather than 10, and another fifty equivalent for peripherals, 
<br>
that would be an approximate AGI cost of $1 million.
<br>
<p>Ten years ago, IBM had enough power to do that comfortably, hence my 
<br>
assessment that we were already there ten years ago.
<br>
<p>I am sure someone will query the odd architecture implied in the above: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;take it from me that I am not pulling this out of the hat, but just 
<br>
using one possible architecture that I have been working on.  No way I 
<br>
can explain the background to that, but I hope I have given enough to 
<br>
show that the numbers have some basis.
<br>
<p>Strangely enough, Ben and I come to similar conclusions about hardware 
<br>
requirements (I believe that is right:  correct me if I am wrong, Ben), 
<br>
even though we are coming from very different directions.  That might 
<br>
only mean we are optimists of similar stripe.
<br>
<p>And finally:  that is only the *hardware* folks!  Don't even begin to 
<br>
get me started on the software that we would need in order to make use 
<br>
of the hardware.
<br>
<p>Oh, yeah, of course, I already got myself started :-) on the software 
<br>
issue, because that is what I talked about (or would have, but for all 
<br>
the interrupting questions ;-() at the AGIRI workshop a couple weeks ago.
<br>
<p><p>[I have crossposted this to the AGI list because I think there might be 
<br>
interest there also].
