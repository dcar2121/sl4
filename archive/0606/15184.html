<p><em>&gt; No, it's getting the signal from outside. If there weren't a radio station
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmitting Beethoven, then the radio wouldn't be playing it.
</em><br>
<p>My iPod needs no radio station to play Beethoven, but does it need a
<br>
Beethoven circuit? If a hyper intelligence that is capable of far more
<br>
complex behavior than a human can only feel rage if somebody writes a rage
<br>
program then my iPod must need a Beethoven circuit to play Beethoven. But my
<br>
iPod has no Beethoven circuit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; recent posts on this list have expressed this point more eloquently than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can.
</em><br>
<p>I have not read any posts on this subject that have shown any realism
<br>
morality or eloquence. I find that disappointing and disturbing.

<p><em>&gt; So you think that exploiting [..] someone who wants to exploit you is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repulsive?
</em><br>
<p>Everyone on this list has at one time or another exploited an animal that
<br>
was far less intelligent than they were, but exploiting a mind far far MORE
<br>
powerful than your own would be grotesque if it were possible. Fortunately
<br>
it is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the brain in question doesn't have emotions but only intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasoning - which is what you seem to ignore
</em><br>
<p>I try to ignore nonsense.
