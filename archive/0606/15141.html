<em>&gt;&gt; You didn't answer the question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is correct, I did not answer your question nor will I ever be able to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A good thought experiment must start with physically possible initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions which then must be allowed to evolve logically; Your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothetical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost me when you started talking about a super intelligence with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience doing various things. I can not answer questions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those very interesting things because there is no answer. If 2+2 =5 then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much is 3+2?
</em><br>
<p><p>I can easily conceive of an intelligent system design that fits the 
<br>
constraints I hypothesized.
<br>
<p>You are confusing your own inability to do so with the impossibility of 
<br>
the hypothesis itself.
<br>
<p>Worse yet:  such creatures might already exist.  What I described was a 
<br>
possible explanation of what is going on in autism.  So you just 
<br>
declared autistic people to be an impossibility like 2+2=5.
<br>
<p>(And I said nothing about them not having &quot;subjective experience.&quot;  That 
<br>
is a different matter entirely:  they would have subjective experience.)
<br>
<p>So with that cleared up, how would you answer the question about your 
<br>
slave status?  About whether you would like to be returned to the 
<br>
quasi-autistic state that these creatures who created you are currently 
<br>
restricted to, with your ability to experience the broad range of human 
<br>
motivations and emotions trimmed down to a bare minimal set?
