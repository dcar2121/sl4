<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone want to venture a guess on the public awareness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Singularity in, say, 2010 or 2015?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the Singularity will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (1) remain the province of a few hundred or a few thousand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; super-technologically-aware types (like, e.g., hints of possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for faster-than-light spaceflight today);
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (2) or spread into the awareness of hundreds of thousands or millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; educated people (like, e.g. private space travel or nanotech today);
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (3) or become a major social issue followed by tens or hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; millions (like, e.g., genetically engineered food or nuclear power 
</em><br>
today).
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any thoughts?

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; One way to acquire sufficient computational resources would be to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; publish an on-line game (or community?  2nd Life?) in which much of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; computation was done by what is essentially voluntary participants in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; bot-net.  This would be even better if the game could be so structured
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; that portions of the game score depended on solving challenges that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; those needed by the program's operation.  (Since these would be &quot;high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; level&quot; challenges, they should have high rewards attached to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; There would, after all, be a large probability of failure.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is this feasible?  ??  Is 2nd Life involved in such a scenario?  ??  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; tend to think not.)  But do note that a lot of the time in these games
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the computer is essentially waiting for the user to react.  This time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; represents available CPU cycles that don't need to be merely discarded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; (Of course, with a lot of designs the OS already uses them for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; background processing.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Actually I was thinking of something more along the lines of a &quot;massively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; single-player&quot; game where users different reactions to a partially 
</em><br>
simulated,
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but mostly representational hard take-off would yeild different 
</em><br>
post-singular
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; futures, so that the end-game is, to an extend, user created content. Then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people could put this stuff up and compare notes and singularity awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would generally improve for the better. The upcoming Spore might have the 
</em><br>
same
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; effect on people's awarenss of xenobiology concepts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Second Life isn't really a challenge oriented user environment; the only 
</em><br>
real
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; goals are aesthetic, with the result being a heterogeneous environment of 
</em><br>
user
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; created content. Since a desirable post-singular future could probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; described as a heterogeneous environment of user created content, it makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sense to see a soft take-off being facilitated and &quot;padded&quot; by successive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; generations of such platforms. I don't know if designing a system that used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; human play to teach an AGI (if that's what you're getting at) is desirable 
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; feasible. Its not feasible because if the virtual world doesn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; commercial entertianment appeal, you'll never get funding for it short of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; DARPA taking a very serious and creative stance on AGI, and its not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; nessecarily desirable because AGI pattern recognition isn't going to be 
</em><br>
mature
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enough to handle such an environment in early stages.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Well, that wasn't what I meant...but it's an interesting model for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more advanced version.  Create the entity as a character in the game or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;community, and have it interact with the community to practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interacting with people.  This clearly depends on an environment where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are lots of people acting rather &quot;normally&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But what I was actually thinking of was using the game in the same way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that &quot;bot-networks&quot; use the computers that they zombify.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences would be that you would only do this while they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;playing/participating, and that you would be doing this with the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge of the players.  I don't see this as requiring that the &quot;game&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be challenge oriented.  A community seems, if anything, a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environment.  It might even facilitate the learning of the meanings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words:  the entity would &quot;hear&quot; the words being used in a context that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would be fully informed about.  There are even precedents, NPCs, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have lowered the expectations so that if the NPC acted in ways that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weren't too intelligent, then this would be accepted, and as it learned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to act more intelligently and more helpfully, THIS would be accepted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A NPC &quot;passing&quot; for a player would be a kind of a milestone.  (But don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take that too seriously, remember that Eliza once fooled a professor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into mistaking it for a human...resulting a a very angry professor.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Using a infra-human AGI to both direct and learn from such an environment 
</em><br>
as
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; part of its sensory modality isn't a bad idea though, something to consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; maybe five years down the line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if Ben's optimism regarding parrallel hardware is accurate or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; not, but I don't think human support can make up for raw computation, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; human support can aid pattern learning significantly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Patrick
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Parallel hardware is very important, but you pay a high price.  Syncing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up costs a lot, so you need to be very careful how you divide things.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you are doing neural networks, I presume that there is some more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious approach, but for me ... justifying a forked process is a tough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing to do on my current system.  Forking is relatively expensive, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I only have a couple of processors anyway.  But if you chose your fork
</em><br>
<em>&gt;points properly you don't lose much.  Low level parallelism, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;becomes very inefficient on standard processors.  I suspect that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;approach that depends on it is going to need to structure itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hierarchically, though each &quot;level&quot; of nodes will need lots of sideway
</em><br>
<em>&gt;communication within it's local group (ganglion?  column?).  Then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need error checks, etc.  Predictions help here.  If you don't see what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you predicted you would see, then you need to check for errors.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do, you can probably skip that step.  (This is sometimes a mistake...but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people seem to work that way, so it's probably a reasonable cost to pay.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Note that one of the main functions of the clustering is to limit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amount of interprocessor communication required in a parallel system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If parallel systems weren't VERY important, there's no way that anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would pay for this kind of overhead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, silicon chips are a LOT faster than wetware...and a lot more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive .. and emit more heat.  This probably implies that the ideal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;design will be different, with more processing at each &quot;cell&quot;, and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;parallelism.  NOT none.  And this is a design decision that is sensitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the costs of various ways of doing things, so if CPU prices plunge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and massively parallel systems become more common, the &quot;best choice&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will be different.  It would, however, require a very unexpected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;technology change to make the fastest AI design look much like the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;design of the human brain.  (Parallelism, yes, but there are reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limitations.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OTOH, we already know that at least one neural network design can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reliably produce intelligent behavior.  There's a certain amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense in going with something that you have good reason to believe will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work.
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of the hardware substrate, if an AGI was at the level where it was 
<br>
capable of making context-sensitive judgments, I agree that organizing a 
<br>
online community to frame such contexts would be a very novel and probably 
<br>
effective way of teaching the thing, like taking a child into public and 
<br>
letting it observe social behavior. You just need to consider that developing 
<br>
that online community has costs involved, though new middleware platforms like 
<br>
metaverse could allow those development costs and times to be minimized, and 
<br>
people could be enticed to play by the novelty that an AGI is learning from 
<br>
their endeavors.
