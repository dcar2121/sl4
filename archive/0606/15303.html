Subject: Mind Reading - Approach to Friendliness
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Concept is pretty simple. You develop really powerful analytical/debugging 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applications that can display the entire contents of the AI mind in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tractable and useful visual representations and extrapolations into future 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states of the mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Strategy:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let the AI 'sleep' (i.e. down-time) long enough to periodically analyze 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the entire contents of the mind. The point in the analysis is to isolate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas of potential risk/danger and either directly modify/secure these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas, or to instruct the AI via it's communication channel with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers (and obviously check up on the AI's obediance).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theoertically, the only window for danger would be in the period it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awake and thinking. It would need to come to several conclusions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneously that all affirmed some non-Friendly behavior, and develop 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that intention into a non-Friendly action before it went to sleep.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A strategy to combat this possibility would be to develop dynamic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diaognostic software, that could actively monitor the entire range of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI's mental and external actions. A comprehensive security system would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to be developed to set alerts, automatic shut downs, security 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warnings, and anything abnormal or potentially remarkeable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The point of implementing this strategy is to allow a non-verifiably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AGI to help the programmers and mathematicians developing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness theory in a relatively safe and reliable manner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Hank
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I don't believe that this will allow ordinary humans to detect all, or even 
<br>
most of the possible failures (you are viewing the present state of the 
<br>
system only, and that says nothing about future states).  With such a 
<br>
system, you may be incredibly lucky enough to detect a major fault early 
<br>
enough to make it less dangerous (or friendly, if such a thing is 
<br>
practically possible), or to shut it down, but the fact of the matter is 
<br>
that the time and resources required to design and implement such a system 
<br>
seems to me that it would do more harm than good.  Someone else could build 
<br>
an unfriendly AI while you are working on a system that may make little or 
<br>
no difference at all in the end result.
<br>
<p>I won't take the naive approach to suggesting a better alternative, and what 
<br>
do any of us really know at this point?  I say wait a few more years, and at 
<br>
least get to the point where preliminary AGI experimentation is starting to 
<br>
emerge so that you can have a foundation to start with.
