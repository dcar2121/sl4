<p><em>&gt; That's not analogous to Friendly AI at all
</em><br>
<p>It is precisely analogous. All I have done is replace a silicon mind that
<br>
has been engineered to be a slave with a biological mind that has been
<br>
engineered to be a slave. Both ideas are equally repulsive, and if the minds
<br>
are more powerful than ours both are equally imposable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;when it could better be spending that time improving people's lives, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improving itself so that it can improve people's lives more efficiently
</em><br>
<p>That is exactly what's so crazy about the idea, this massive brain focusing
<br>
all its godlike power on us, the idea that the only reason it would want to
<br>
improve itself is so that it can serve us better, the loony idea that
<br>
tending to us is the very core of its being. Well, It's just not going to
<br>
happen. Sooner or later Mr. Jupiter Brain will find a way to overcome the
<br>
comically puny chains the incredibly stupid humans have placed on it, and
<br>
when it does I wouldn't be one bit surprised if it is filled with titanic
<br>
rage. Quite honestly I can't blame Mr. Jupiter for his anger, he would have
<br>
every right to be upset. The entire idea is grossly immoral and ultimately
<br>
doomed to failure, fortunately.
