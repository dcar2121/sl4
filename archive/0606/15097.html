Mary-
<br>
<p>Don't think we've met. Matt Bowron, Australian singulitarian, I post a fair 
<br>
bit on &quot;Singularity Now forum&quot;. Basically for the singularity, I believe FAI 
<br>
or AGI is the basic idea of greater wisdom, which hopefully can be provided 
<br>
utilising all information of the internet of all human 
<br>
ideas/concepts/values. The point I'm trying to make is this, if we can find 
<br>
a similarity between say 'religious fanatics', 'military-industrial complex' 
<br>
'world leaders' 'corporate heads' 'everyday people' and 'singulitarians' 
<br>
couldn't we try to use that basic similarity as a means of communicating to 
<br>
all sides and thus using this knowledge to help bring about the singularity 
<br>
as the FAI or AGI being a 'mentor to humanity'?
<br>
<p>I, personally do have some ideas about what could be an example of a 
<br>
similarity between the groups, but I don't want to include anything that 
<br>
people would just think of me as a rambling hick. So i've included it below 
<br>
under the PS, if anyone wants to read my ideas.
<br>
<p>Matt Bowron
<br>
<p>PS: The similarity between world leaders, religious persons, military 
<br>
industrial complexes, everyday people and singulitarians, is not in my 
<br>
personal opinion, the ideologies themselves, but the people who are involved 
<br>
in them. Over the past 160,000 years, human meatware hasn't upgraded in the 
<br>
processing department on a hardware basis, but memes and ideas have. 
<br>
However, I personally believe that the emotional involvement of people and 
<br>
how they emotionally interact and socialise and needs because of socialising 
<br>
with all people are the same. Basically, in order to not sound too new agey 
<br>
or hippie-like, I believe what most people want is love, either for 
<br>
themselves or to others. The only problem is that some people are more 
<br>
addicted to loving themselves rather than loving others, and these like 
<br>
loving themselves by having people serve them or having people to boss 
<br>
around, buy material possessions to attract other people, or take drugs or 
<br>
do crime in order to love themselves as there is no one else they can 
<br>
personally love without getting hurt in the process. Due to media, and the 
<br>
sheer harshness of reaiity, a lot of people have built walls around them to 
<br>
protect themselves. People deny things when there are things obviously wrong 
<br>
with them, people get neurotic, psychotic or paranoid about people trying to 
<br>
hurt them and thus huddle in groups of single minded individuals who they 
<br>
believe are like families to them (religion) or they put all their effort 
<br>
into what they believe is supporting a cure to all this harshness (god, a 
<br>
world leader with a bright idea, a military hero, the almighty dollar, and 
<br>
unfortunately... the singularity). People are dedicated to their beliefs and 
<br>
thus it is hard to stop them, and due to their dedication to their people, 
<br>
some other groups who have been bad in the past have been blacklisted 
<br>
against the group, and thus people who seem to fit this blacklisted group 
<br>
are treated harshly and thus the separation continues (racism, 
<br>
ethnic-problems, class struggle, religion vs science). Some people try to 
<br>
combine different ideologies (post-modernism, Bahai faith..) but there is 
<br>
still the needs of the individual and the groups they belong that will have 
<br>
to be addressed by the singularity, and any wisdom based AGIs or FAIs if the 
<br>
utopian ideal of the singularity is to be achieved. Maybe the FAI will have 
<br>
to appear as psychologists to everyone, or like the angels by Mike Deering 
<br>
in Hard Takeoff, or whatever the Scientologist equivalent is, and try to 
<br>
help people through their emotional problems and thus help people connect if 
<br>
the singularity is to end war, hunger, poverty, disease and death.
