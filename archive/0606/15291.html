(x-posted to extropy-chat)
<br>
<p>Back in 2003 there was a popular-press article on Allan Snyder's work
<br>
with using transcranial magnetic stimulation to temporarily induce
<br>
savant-like abilities in human subjects, reportedly having effects
<br>
like drawing ability or Rainman-style counting:
<br>

<p>It looks like there's now a publication on some of his results:
<br>

<br>
<p>Title: Savant-like numerosity skills revealed in normal people by
<br>
magnetic pulses
<br>
<p>Abstract: Oliver Sacks observed autistic twins who instantly guessed
<br>
the exact number of matchsticks that had just fallen on the floor,
<br>
saying in unison &quot;111&quot;. To test the suggestion that normal individuals
<br>
have the capacity for savant numerosity, we temporarily simulated the
<br>
savant condition in normal people by inhibiting the left anterior
<br>
temporal lobe of twelve participants with repetitive transcranial
<br>
magnetic stimulation (rTMS). This site has been implicated in the
<br>
savant condition. Ten participants improved their ability to
<br>
accurately guess the number of discrete items immediately following
<br>
rTMS and, of these, eight became worse at guessing as the effects of
<br>
the pulses receded. The probability of as many as eight out of twelve
<br>
people doing best just after rTMS and not after sham stimulation by
<br>
chance alone is less than one in one thousand.
<br>
<p>(If you can't access the full-text PDF, let me know, and I can send you a copy)
<br>
<p>FYI, it looks like there's also some other publications and
<br>
popular-press articles regarding Snyder here:
<br>

<br>
<p>I'm still waiting to see similar results reproduced in other labs, but
<br>
it's certainly interesting stuff.
