Ah, another Monday morning coming back to mischaracterizations:
<br>
<p>On 6/25/06, Richard Loosemore &lt;<a href="mailto:rpwl@lightlink.com?Subject=Re:%20analytical%20rigor">rpwl@lightlink.com</a>&gt; wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt; You may be mistaking fuzziness in your own understanding of the issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for fuzziness in the issues themselves.
</em><br>
<p>Lets be clear here. You had a quote by Strogatz, where he quotes Ulam
<br>
explaining that there are a lot of nonlinear systems. Then you went on
<br>
for two paragraphs about 'vast' areas and 'tiny piles of analytically
<br>
tractable systems' and &quot;Outer Darkness&quot; You characterize this
<br>
situation as a very obvious and important divide between linear and
<br>
nonlinear systems. You do, of course, neglect to reference anything
<br>
more than a quote of a casual quote, mention any specific claims of
<br>
intractability, or reference any &quot;impossible&quot; problems that have stood
<br>
for the &quot;centuries&quot; you're broadly painting.
<br>
<p>That's what I mean by fuzziness. If you /mean/ something specific,
<br>
then by all means correct me. As far as I can tell, your point thus
<br>
far in your first two paragraphs and subsequent responses is to assert
<br>
that there are lots and lots of nonlinear systems, most of which are
<br>
insoluble, and that all of mathematics (and presumably other sciences)
<br>
has resulted in very little progress in this space, on the basis of a
<br>
quote and a lot of adjectives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If Stephen Strogatz could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand these points well enough to write about them in his book, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if he has not yet lost his job or his status as a world-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematician specializing in nonlinear systems, and if I repeat them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, applied to AGI issues, then it begins to look like the points I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made actually have a great deal of depth, whereas your criticism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains nothing that indicates understanding, only complaints.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a well respected author is evidence for some depth in a debate somewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you claiming that the SL4 list imagines the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world is a linear place? Did you think that the statement &quot;most claims
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of impossibility usually turn out to be unreliable&quot; applied largely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mathematical claims of intractability(which it doesn't, as far as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can tell, it refers to specific technological achievement, deriving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the older quote &quot;If a respected elder scientist says something is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; possible, he is very likely right, if he says something is impossible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; he is very likely wrong&quot;, deriving from older embarassing anecdotes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about Lord Kelvin, who was very prone to declarative statements.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't think of anything more vague and fuzzy than the idiotic quote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about elder scientists.  I am not operating at that level, I am talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about deep methodological issues.  I wouldn't dream of wasting my time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on debating whether or not old scientists talk garbage.
</em><br>
<p>This is nice. Respond to the sub note, it's the most important part of
<br>
this paragraph. Do you have an answer to either question? To me, it
<br>
seems like you're twisting the definition of 'impossibility' (and the
<br>
applicability of the quote) to make a vague point about the big and
<br>
scary world of Complex systems.
<br>
<p>Who are you talking about? What are you accusing them of?
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, please:  let's keep &quot;conspiracy&quot; talk out of this.  I didn't say or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imply anything about conspiracies, so it would helpe if you didn't put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words into my mouth.
</em><br>
<p>You are accusing unknown persons of having a 'stranglehold' on 'AI
<br>
research'. I'll use a different word if it makes you feel better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a ridiculously naive view of what science is actually like.  Get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out there and talk to some real scientists about biasses and funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwagons and prejudices and power centers.  Or, if you can't do that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read some books by people who study how science works.  Failing that, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least don't say anything about it.
</em><br>
<p>What 'view' would you say that paragraph was espousing? Did I claim
<br>
any mechanism or make, in fact, any claims about 'what science is
<br>
actually like'? All I said was that scientists don't care about what
<br>
you do. And have no motivation to interfere with your work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You could trying to read about the role played by Behaviorists in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology community.  That situation is closely analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present situation in AI.
</em><br>
<p>Luckily, I've already been interested in psychology a long time, and I
<br>
am familiar with the dominance of the Behaviorist model. It's true
<br>
that a lot of good research didn't get done because it did not fit the
<br>
Behaviorist paradigm. Unfortunately for your point, a lot of
<br>
scientists continued with what they were doing anyway, on their own
<br>
tenure, or in private research, or even outside established science.
<br>
That's why psychology has moved on. Certainly if the majority view is
<br>
'wrong', and that view is being taught to students, then less people
<br>
will be doing science the 'right' way. That's not an active force
<br>
preventing anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would have been nicer if, anywhere in your message, you had addressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a single, solitary grain of the issues I raised, or asked questions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clarify some aspect of what I said, so you could go further and talk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the issues.
</em><br>
<p>I objected to your argument on the grounds that you weren't making any
<br>
concrete points, and challenged you to make some specific claims.
<br>
That's a valid criticism, under whatever philosophy of science you
<br>
follow. Also, I asked three questions, although the last was partly
<br>
rhetorical:
<br>
<p>Are you claiming that the SL4 list imagines the
<br>
world is a linear place?
<br>
<p>Did you think that the statement &quot;most claims
<br>
of impossibility usually turn out to be unreliable&quot; applied largely to
<br>
mathematical claims of intractability?
<br>
<p>I'm sorry you don't like what most scientists are doing, so
<br>
what?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact that you did not, but instead just complained about nebulous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faults that you imagined you saw, is part of the collective abdication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of scientific responsibility I was talking about in the first place:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you avoided the issue.
</em><br>
<p>You filled an email with unspecific adjective-laden sentences,
<br>
accusing unnamed persons of being self-deluded, of obstructing AI
<br>
research, of not recognizing some grand truth about the
<br>
incomprehensibility of the world. I felt that you were sniping
<br>
opportunistically, writing without specific claims, making dramatic
<br>
points without support. I don't have a case to prove, you do.
<br>
<p>If you think all AI research is missing something, what is that? You
<br>
refuse to specifically point to errors or approaches, or make any
<br>
specific predictions. You write about what stupid, naive, blinded folk
<br>
we are, and are aggravated when someone points out that you are just
<br>
asserting so with big words. I don't even have a clear idea who or
<br>
what theories or community you are slandering, only that they're
<br>
holding back all progress. So, by induction, since I think I'm making
<br>
progress, and part of 'the establishment' by virtue of having a job in
<br>
AI, I assume I must be part of the problem. So, where to begin
<br>
correcting my many faults?
<br>
<p>What, in fact, is your issue that I'm avoiding?
<br>
