<p>Can you name a few of these &quot;many people?&quot;  I hope you are not referring to 
<br>
me because there are characteristics I have discussed that logically *could

not* have evolved in a hunter gatherer environment.  They are emergent from 
<br>
characteristics that did evolve though they are usually called &quot;side effects.&quot;
<br>
<p>Our psychological characteristic of being vulnerable to addictive drugs is 
<br>
the strongest example.
