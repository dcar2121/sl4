<p><p>Mary,
<br>
<p>I have to add my voice to yours and say that I am also extremely 
<br>
concerned about these factors.
<br>
<p>I am not quite sure that they will play out in the way you specify, but 
<br>
nevertheless the connection between what we want to get done, and what 
<br>
the very powerful want to get done, is not discussed often enough.
<br>
<p>Mostly, I worry less about them trying to stop it completely, as that 
<br>
they might go into Headless Chicken mode and start acting towards it in 
<br>
ways that ruin our chances of creating anything beneficial, or trying to 
<br>
do it in stupid or dangerous ways, whilst saying in public that they, 
<br>
like us, want to create a &quot;better&quot; world through technology.
<br>
<p>And my bottom-line working assumption at the present time is this:  my 
<br>
experience of government and powerful business interests is that they 
<br>
are so disorganized and so collectively unconscious that they are 
<br>
effectively not there at the moment.  The 64,000 left hands knoweth not 
<br>
what the 64,000 right hands are doing.
<br>
<p>As far as those folks are concerned, we are just a bunch of alchemists 
<br>
banging on the door saying &quot;Hey, we got a method for turning lead into 
<br>
gold out here!  Don't you want to hear about it?!&quot;
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
