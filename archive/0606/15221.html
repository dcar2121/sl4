I know that there are very specialized cases where evolution is locally 
<br>
pseudo-Lamarkian, but I would say that Lamark's simple ideas were wrong and 
<br>
the underlying concept has no truth to it.  However, Darwinian evolution is 
<br>
extremely flexible/capable and &quot;organism&quot; is a fairly crude and naive 
<br>
concept so organisms evolve to adapt and sometimes phenomena that look 
<br>
slightly Lamarkian from an organism centric perspective take place within 
<br>
Darwinian evolution.
<br>
I make this distinctin because the data that modern pseudo-Lamarkianism is 
<br>
based on was absolutely not predicted by Lamark's theory nor was similar 
<br>
data any part of the foundation of his theory.  His theory was simply 
<br>
totally wrong, just like the Greek theory where the Earth orbits the 
<br>
&quot;central fire&quot; which is NOT identified as the sun.  In general, by 
<br>
themselves, surface feature similarities != agreement or confirmation.
<br>
<p>At any rate, I have not been denying that science, experiment, and 
<br>
empiricism are EXTREMELY useful, only trying to clarify exactly how 
<br>
extremely useful they are.  MNT is extremely useful, but it's easy for 
<br>
cranks to get carried away and claim that it will give us alchemy or cheap, 
<br>
useful and unlimited zero point energy.

<em>&gt;Michael,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;About Lamarckian evolution...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In fact there is a lot of recent evidence that the &quot;central dogma&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;molecular biology (as Francis Crick called it) [the lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant information transfer from the environment back into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetic material during the lifespan of an organism] is worked around
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in interesting ways, in real biological systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Back in the 80s, Cairns et al argued based on some experiments with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bacteria that there is significant transfer of information back into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the genetic material based on the environmental experience of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organism.  They talked about &quot;directed mutation.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, it seems that  this phenomenon could possibly be explained by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judicious environmental effects on mutation rate, thus remaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basically consistent with the central dogma
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=297545">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=297545</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is a bunch of more recent work following up this theme, though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't have the references handy....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, yeah, Lamarck's simple ideas were wrong, but the underlying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concept does appear to have some truth to it, in subtle ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Something which is being discovered via EXPERIMENT, obviously, not by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;armchair theorizing....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Armchair theorizing should be able to tell you that both Darwinian and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lamarckian evolution are possible, as well as various complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combinations thereof....  But exploring which combinations are used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nature is obviously a matter of experiment...
</em><br>
