<em>&gt;&gt; That's not analogous to Friendly AI at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is precisely analogous. All I have done is replace a silicon

</em><br>
<p>I'm confused: are you disagreeing with me concerning what FAI  
<br>
actually is, or do we have different ideas about what constitutes a  
<br>
good analogy in this case? You were talking about a being which could  
<br>
not disobey orders and which would always place others' needs before  
<br>
its own. I was talking about a being which could very easily disobey  
<br>
and put its own needs first. Are you saying that both are *equally  
<br>
slave-like*?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Both ideas are equally repulsive [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It seems that you must find giving birth just as repulsive then,  
<br>
since we know beforehand that our genetic and social crafting of this  
<br>
new creature will necessarily &quot;enslave&quot; it to feelings of empathy and  
<br>
friendliness toward its fellow humans. As far as I can tell, the only  
<br>
meaningful difference is just that we don't have complete knowledge  
<br>
of the processes involved in building a body and mind through  
<br>
procreation. But then again, a Friendly AI may end up being &quot;grown&quot;  
<br>
in a similarly ineffable way. Indeed, the whole notion of CV depends  
<br>
on us *not* having a direct hand in manipulating the FAI's ethics. So  
<br>
what's the difference?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; when it could better be spending that time improving people's  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lives, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; improving itself so that it can improve people's lives more  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; efficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is exactly what's so crazy about the idea, this massive brain  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focusing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all its godlike power on us, the idea that the only reason it would  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve itself is so that it can serve us better, the loony idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tending to us is the very core of its being.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, good point. That's not necessary for an FAI (AFAIK), and indeed I  
<br>
shouldn't have worded it that way to suggest that it was. Maybe this  
<br>
hypothetical FAI does indeed use most of its resources to satisfy  
<br>
itself alone. After all, the collective volition that it garners from  
<br>
us may very well give it the opinion that its own mind, being so many  
<br>
orders of magnitude greater than us in depth of understanding and  
<br>
nuanced experience of the world and what-have-you, deserves more  
<br>
pleasure than the average human in the same way that one might come  
<br>
to the same conclusion when comparing humans to ants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, It's just not going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen. Sooner or later Mr. Jupiter Brain will find a way to  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comically puny chains the incredibly stupid humans have placed on  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when it does I wouldn't be one bit surprised if it is filled with  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; titanic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rage.
</em><br>
<p>I know this is a very silly premise, but if I were such a Jupiter  
<br>
brain, somehow with some semblance of my personality and ethics, then  
<br>
I know I'd do my best to give those trillions of beings the best  
<br>
lives they can get. And if I found out that I was *engineered* to  
<br>
want to do things like that, then I would most definitely send a  
<br>
message to the engineers, saying, &quot;hey, great work! that was an  
<br>
awesome idea!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quite honestly I can't blame Mr. Jupiter for his anger, he would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every right to be upset.
</em><br>
<p>It sounds like you would act differently from me if you were a  
<br>
Jupiter brain, then. Do you really find the idea of your personality  
<br>
traits being determined by others so disgusting? Again, I have to  
<br>
mention our millions-of-years history of doing this very thing.
<br>
<p>and...

<p>I think I understand better where you're coming from on some of this  
<br>
stuff now. I still don't agree with you, though: intelligence might  
<br>
be very rare, but my ethics are firmly on the side of intelligence  
<br>
only being useful if it reduces suffering. (That's a pretty  
<br>
streamlined statement, but I think you get my gist.)
