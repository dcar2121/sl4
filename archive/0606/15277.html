<p>Let's say I want to learn how to play Go well, but I don't have anybody
<br>
to play with.
<br>
<p>I can start by solving the game on small boards. Then I can look for
<br>
fast, compact rules that guess the correct move, or accurately predict
<br>
the final board position from the current position. Then I can start
<br>
playing games against myself on larger boards. Any time I find a clever
<br>
move, I look for other positions where I could apply it. Any time my
<br>
depth-1 analysis disagrees with my depth-5 analysis, I figure my depth-5
<br>
analysis is probably more accurate, and I can look for heuristics that
<br>
would make my depth-1 analysis agree with it. I can see which openings
<br>
win most often. I can prove theorems about Go like Benson's Rule. I can
<br>
do all this without ever playing Go against somebody else.
<br>
<p>Of course, some problems require more data than others. Generally, if
<br>
you're trying to figure out the implications of a small set of axioms,
<br>
you don't need to spend a lot of time gathering data. If you're trying
<br>
to work backwards from the implications to figure out which axioms they
<br>
came from, more data would certainly help. Math is a problem space of
<br>
the former type, and physics is a problem space of the latter type.
<br>
<p>Then there's stuff like chemistry, where you already know the axioms and
<br>
you're trying to figure out their implications, but you just don't have
<br>
enough computing power to do it on your own. Well, if you know how to
<br>
make computronium, this isn't a problem, but let's say you don't.
<br>
Fortunately, nature provides us with a lot of computing power that's
<br>
already configured for figuring out the implications of the axioms of
<br>
chemistry.
<br>
<p>I actually think you could &quot;solve chemistry&quot; without that kind of brute
<br>
force if you're clever enough, but even if you can't, it's not all that
<br>
important to RSI. I think recursive self-improvement is more like math
<br>
or Go than like chemistry. You already know what optimization is about,
<br>
but you don't know the computationally cheap way to do it.
