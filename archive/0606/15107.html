<em>&gt; The &quot;narrow&quot; viewpoint of &quot;selection-focused&quot; evolutionary biology is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as I know, mainstream science.  Non-mainstream evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theories regularly decry the focus on selection rather than their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorite hypothetical forces - but it is well to remember that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not mainstream.

<p>I agree that the majority attitude among contemporary biologists is
<br>
what I would call &quot;narrowly selection-focused&quot;, but I don't think that
<br>
the alternative attitude is all *that* rare in the biology
<br>
community....
<br>
<p>For instance, I think that currently a
<br>
self-organization/emergence-rather-than-selection focus is more common
<br>
in the bio community than an AGI focus is in the AI community ;-)
<br>
<p>Having worked a lot with biologists in the last few years, I am
<br>
specifically not confident in the ability of the contemporary biology
<br>
community to come to grips with &quot;big issues&quot; regarding the nature of
<br>
life, evolution, and so forth.  Biologists by and large have become
<br>
very narrow-focused, which is to the science's benefit in some
<br>
regards, but not all regards.
<br>
<p>Regarding Gould, I know he is controversial and I don't agree with him
<br>
on all points myself, so I don't want to have a thread on the pros and
<br>
cons of Gould.  IMO that would be a complicated argument as he had a
<br>
lot of very good points as well as a lot of misleading examples and
<br>
overstatements in his writings.
<br>
<p>The arguments between selection-focused and self-organization-focused
<br>
evolutionary biology theorists are ultimately somewhat subtle, because
<br>
(almost) everyone accepts the existence of a common set of processes
<br>
and mechanisms -- so their arguments are basically over the relative
<br>
frequency and relative importance of various phenomena.  These are
<br>
tricky arguments to resolve when the data we have (regarding the
<br>
history of evolution) is so poor...
