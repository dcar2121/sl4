</em><br>
<p>I don't think this position can bear close examination.  Say we develop
<br>
a Friendly SI.  As part of its working definition of friendliness let
<br>
us suppose this SI believes in the self-determination of individual
<br>
sentient creatures.  Ve believes this at least to the extent of not
<br>
simply rewiring those whose current wiring and mindset makes miserable
<br>
and/or prone to violence and other forms of suffering.  What can be done?
<br>
As I have suggested before, one thing that can be done is to so arrange
<br>
things that said sentients can work out all of their kinks and problems
<br>
taking however long it takes.  When they destroy one another either the
<br>
destruction takes place in a simulation that the actors do not know is
<br>
a simulation (or will not believe it is) or the actors are so well backed
<br>
up that they can be resurrected or &quot;reincarnated&quot; as many times as needed
<br>
to learn better ways of being and/or be open to some &quot;rewiring&quot;.  In my
<br>
opinion any Friendly SI that comes into being with coexistent lesser 
<br>
sentients will hit on some variant of this solution.  Far from showing
<br>
the SI to be uncaring, relative non-intervention and allowing the world
<br>
to look like it needs to for the level of beings inhabiting it might be
<br>
the very essence and utterly necessary manifestation of caring. 
<br>
<p>It is possible that making it too obvious this is a simulation or that
<br>
there is an SI would ruin the particular learning environment we currently
<br>
inhabit.  So we get only hints, guesses, supposedly ancient truths 
<br>
buried in myths and seeming tall tales and so on.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rationalized religious theories often need to invent exotic scenarios in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it's okay to split the Red Sea a few thousand years ago, but not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; save a cancer victim in the present day.  In other words, rationalized
</em><br>
<p>In an age where magical events were more acceptable, splitting the Red
<br>
Sea might have made perfect sense to allow in the simulation as a one
<br>
shot special effect.  Who knows. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; religious theories naturally give rise to highly inconsistent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inexplicable theories of when a superintelligence will intervene and why;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain and death are &quot;natural tests&quot; in one instance, and horrors in
</em><br>
<p>If we are in a sim then the pain and death are no more ultimately real
<br>
than getting fragged in Quake.  Except in Quake you aren't fully wired
<br>
in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; another; a miracle is an unacceptable giveaway of intervention today, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a great proof to the glory of God a few centuries ago.  Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligences may of course be inexplicable, but the problem is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these inconsistencies are *not* inexplicable.  They have a very clear and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious pattern.  They are the result of trying to rationalize a religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose testified miracles are all memetically generated false stories about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past events.  
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From here, you have no way of doing more than surmising that this is the
</em><br>
case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In an Internet-connected world it's much harder to generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false stories about current events, so the religion's account of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present and the past will be inconsistent.  Similarly, if you have a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely governed by the laws of physics, intelligent entities that evolve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be stuck in a world that is painful and inconvenient until they fix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and until they fix it, their fuzzier thinkers will try to rationalize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it - given a certain cognitive architecture, anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everything I see is consistent with a strictly-physics world full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessary pain - including the people trying to explain why it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really unnecessary.
</em><br>
<p><p>That might well  be exactly what you most need to see to grow and do what
<br>
it is you need to do.
