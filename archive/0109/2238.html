</em><br>
<p>I found this catalogue interesting. I'll add one more in the form
<br>
of a mythical creation story:
<br>
<p><p><p>PREFACE: 
<br>
--------
<br>
<p>As a youth, I'd spent considerable time mulling over issues of
<br>
metaphysics and the existence of God. When it suddenly hit me (rather
<br>
late, in my case) that the universe could work without a God and work
<br>
rather well, I converted to being a staunch atheist. With the notion
<br>
of the Singularity and renewed possibility of superbeings and
<br>
simulations, I am back to considering the issue, though I'm somewhat
<br>
weary that I'll be running around in the familiar mental circles of
<br>
youthful folly.
<br>
<p>I have posted to sl4 previously, postulating that the existence of
<br>
suffering in our reality contradicts the notion that a Friendly AI
<br>
emerged at some point in the past and is simulating us presently.
<br>
<p>But now, I'd like to consider an alternate possibility:
<br>
<p><p>THE FROZEN ACCIDENT GOD:
<br>
------------------------
<br>
<p>A long time ago on a small planet circling a yellowish star, a
<br>
technolgical Singularity took place. Eventually, this Singularity
<br>
spread via nanoscale spaceprobes to encompass the entire universe,
<br>
controlling all of space and time.
<br>
<p>But let's go back to the moment of the Singularity. During one of the
<br>
more advanced phases of what is now called &quot;The Emergence&quot;, the young
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky and his team of 99.78th percentile AI researchers
<br>
were putting the nascent AI through a series of tests. One such test
<br>
consisted of the AI reading through posts to a mailing list called
<br>
SL4.  The AI came across a post referring to &quot;THE FROZEN ACCIDENT
<br>
GOD&quot;, which was identical to this very post, as a matter of
<br>
fact. Included in this post is the following description of a
<br>
hypothetical, though vague, and not entirely correct scenario of &quot;The
<br>
Singularity&quot;:
<br>
<p>After Eliezer's team successfully creates a Friendly Super
<br>
Intelligence, the inhabitants of the planet begin uploading and
<br>
securing their memories for all eternity. There is a brief period of
<br>
adjustment where spouses learn of infidelities, politicians learn of
<br>
treachery and children learn there is no Easter Bunny. But all goes
<br>
well because coping is not so computationally difficult. Problems such
<br>
as misremembered events are corrected and refined so that a clearer
<br>
and clearer image of the past is reconstructed. For a period, the
<br>
notion of trade flourishes as people exchange experiences for
<br>
computational resources.
<br>
<p>The SL4 post in question goes on to mention the possibility of a great
<br>
coalescence of minds, but the author doesn't really elaborate and this
<br>
thought is mostly relegated to a single footnote. That's not the
<br>
interesting part anyway.
<br>
<p>The interesting part is the offering of an explanation of the
<br>
existence of suffering in a world simulated by a Friendly AI. To
<br>
understand this, though, the reader needs to think forward to the far
<br>
end of time again when the Singularity has spread to all matter, now a
<br>
form of computronium.  After accelerated eons, the SI(*) has
<br>
propagated to the vast reaches of the universe, learned everything
<br>
worth learning, and has experienced everything deemed worthy to
<br>
experience, all other experiences are predictable variations and
<br>
harmonies of the others.
<br>
<p>The notion of resimulating reality had been formerly proposed by
<br>
Tippler and others. But the AI first took notice of this post to SL4
<br>
and pondered the strange self-referential, self-manifesting idea of
<br>
resimulating all of reality. 
<br>
<p>Several questions were proposed:
<br>
<p>1) &quot;What should be preserved in the simulation?&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the closest acount of actual history be saved with the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highest degree of fidelity? Or should only a simplified version
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of history be repeated with only the essentials and the greatest
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lessons of the ages being distilled and remembered? For example,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good books often take many admirable human characterics and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;combine them into an amalgamated hero of epic grandeur.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaningless events are weeded from an overly long novel.
<br>
<p>2) &quot;Should the simulation loop exactly the same each time or be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improved every iteration?&quot;
<br>
<p>3) &quot;How long will it be before the SI matures and learns the answer to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the eternal question: Is the SI already in a simulation for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;former SI?&quot;
<br>
<p><p>The proposed answer to (1) in the SL4 post is that the exact original
<br>
history is preserved, down the very last details as well as they can
<br>
be determined, keeping all the little frozen accidents and the quirky
<br>
tragectory of events as they happened.
<br>
<p>Pre-singularity history is extremely short compared to the Ages of
<br>
Learning and Beauty that follow. Although some will suffer in the
<br>
re-enactments of early pre-Singularity history, this suffering has
<br>
already been experienced once. Though it shall exist again as an
<br>
infinite echo for preservation, the alternative is to lose a precious
<br>
part of oneself, to lose one's beginning, to become uprooted. There is
<br>
no need to improve &quot;the loop&quot;, because in the following Ages of
<br>
Learning and Beauty, every reasonable improvent is explored,
<br>
including &quot;how to explore those reasonable improvents.&quot; 
<br>
<p>As for the alternative to perfectly repeating history, there is &quot;the
<br>
idealized, smallest possible representation of everything that is
<br>
important with the fewest number of characters as a simulated story&quot;.
<br>
But that doesn't have to be an alternative at all. The idealized
<br>
history can be run as a simulation post-Singularity, and then captured
<br>
as a part of &quot;perfectly repeating history&quot;, a sub-simulation that was
<br>
actually run and preserved.
<br>
<p>The answer to the third question has interesting qualities and
<br>
repercussions.  A superior ancestral AI which has created this world
<br>
as a simulation will be complex enough to elude detection. Because of
<br>
this, some questions prove to be eternal. Throughout the ages of human
<br>
philosophy, the debate between the existence of Free Will
<br>
vs. Determinism raged. A significant problem at human level
<br>
intelligence is that once one knows for sure that one lives in a
<br>
purely deterministic reality, one loses hope and the drive to improve,
<br>
not to mention any basis for personal responsibility. In a sense, it
<br>
is necessary *not* to be able to figure this out too soon.
<br>
Furthermore, an SI cannot readily know for sure whether ve is in a
<br>
simulation, given the non-detectability of a more powerful ancestral
<br>
AI.
<br>
<p>One *can* arrive at the answer to the third question, but doing so
<br>
involves keeping a very deep secret, or more accurately &quot;not guessing
<br>
the real answer&quot; despite numerous hints at the truth, real or
<br>
imagined, along the great journey. Just the right balance of
<br>
scepticism is necessary.
<br>
<p>In the end of all ends, there is only one way to answer the third
<br>
question satisfactorily, and that is to decide whether or not to run
<br>
the whole thing over again. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p>(*) There is only one Super Intelligence because everyone uploaded and
<br>
after a very long period, all interesting realities of individuals had
<br>
been explored, so everyone eventually merged and then all interesting
<br>
realities of merged beings were explored.
<br>
<p><p>PS - 
<br>
<p>I've still been following the list. I've been a bit quiet since I'm a
<br>
tad depressed that my &quot;hobby&quot; software project is taking such a long time
<br>
(which I hope will have some side benefit to Flare). I haven't given up
<br>
yet, though. If I've gotten nowhere by next spring, I'll reassess how
<br>
I should be spending my time to best facilitate some of the SingInst
<br>
projects.
