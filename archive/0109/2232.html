</em><br>
<p>My outlook on other posters is that not everyone will be able to post to
<br>
SL4, just as not everyone has enough writing ability to be published as a
<br>
science-fiction author or sell a nonfiction piece to a local newspaper. 
<br>
The level of ability required is probably less than the former and greater
<br>
than the latter (newspapers' standards are pretty darn low).  A mailing
<br>
list is usually a push format rather than a user-searched format, and so
<br>
it requires gatekeepers.  The purpose of the gatekeepers is not to ensure
<br>
Transhumanist Correctness - after all, the very idea of a gatekeeper is
<br>
quite Transhumanistically Incorrect in the current community, much to
<br>
their detriment - but just to maintain writing quality.  This extends
<br>
beyond spelling and punctuation into message coherence and ability to
<br>
follow a rational line of reasoning, but the ultimate standard is simply: 
<br>
Can I read this without wincing?  Can the other list members read this
<br>
without wincing?  Or will they see it as the invasion of something that
<br>
they subscribed to SL4 to escape?
<br>
<p>There has to be a refuge somewhere.  There has to be somewhere where
<br>
people can go and post (only) intelligent messages and read (only)
<br>
intelligent messages.  I don't believe in the idea of a gatekeeper as a
<br>
safeguard of accuracy - and neither, I expect, does anyone else who's had
<br>
to deal with a real journalist - but I do think that a gatekeeper who is a
<br>
good writer can be expected to ensure good writing, and that a gatekeeper
<br>
who is intelligent can be expected to ensure intelligence.  Opinions on
<br>
SL4 are not my own opinions are most certainly not guaranteed to be
<br>
correct.  But I will try to guarantee that anyone can browse the mailing
<br>
list without wincing.
