&nbsp;Of course, it's not testable whether or not the Singularity has already

&nbsp;Suppose the Singularity has already happened... shouldn't we still work to

&nbsp;improve this illusion?  It's the journey don't you know. :)
<br>
&nbsp;Suppose it hasn't... then we must work to improve this real life.
<br>
&nbsp;Either way, we need to keep working on making life better.

I am guessing that your view is a triumph of hope over experience (not 
<br>
meaning to be snotty). Grief is a real as a physiological and measureable 
<br>
manifestation. I disagree with psychiatrists who appear to say that it 
<br>
diminishes after 6 months. There are also too many questions to be answered 
<br>
for me to feel assured that a) a singularity will happen soon, or b) that we 
<br>
will benefit by such an evolutionary event.  However, I look forward to a 
<br>
vast improvement in the human condition, should such an entity hold sway and 
<br>
deem to offer us some goodies. Ungrateful, I am not.
<br>
<p>My own more pessimistic, obsession, is with a variation of an Omega Point or 
<br>
a Moravec Point of some kind, that will allieviate past injustices, sorrows, 
<br>
missed opportunities, failures, ad naseum; to be resolved in The Great 
<br>
Someday, perhaps billions or trillions of years forward in the minkowski-De 
<br>
sitter Light cone, that we inhabit.  Because it is so distant, so 
<br>
pessimistic, I thus believe it may be more plausible, then a dance with the 
<br>
new kid on the block, Ms. Singularity, a decade or 3, hence.
