I suggest one or more individuals make it their primary function to prepare
<br>
and present the concepts associated with AI and hit the corporate world to
<br>
meet people face-to-face.  It will require funding on a far lesser scale to
<br>
send out a dedicated spokesperson/salesperson.  Somebody &quot;out there&quot; will
<br>
see the promise, of this I'm confident.  I remember the scene in CONTACT
<br>
when the future of the project required serious funding, she hit the road.

<p><p>What we need at this point is funding. We would like to be able to bring
<br>
on 4 or more new researchers within the next 6 months. If anyone here has
<br>
the capability to begin a sustained series of long term donations, or if
<br>
anyone here knows someone who could, then we would definitely urge you to
<br>
think seriously about working to get some funding sent our way. I agree
<br>
that recent events show that the sooner we can achieve a safe Singularity,
<br>
the better.
