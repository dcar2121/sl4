*Bzzzt.*
<br>
<p>Not the whole thread, but some aspects of it.
<br>
<p>It is possible to discuss religion in the light of SL4 topics.  But it has
<br>
to be done carefully.  Just discussing something ultrapowerful and
<br>
ultraintelligent, even omnipotent and omniscient, is not the same as a
<br>
license to switch on the faith-activated areas of the brain and say
<br>
anything that enters your head.
<br>
<p>The reason I am invoking the great and awesome power of *bzzt* in defense
<br>
of this principle is not just that this kind of fuzzy thinking is like a
<br>
cheese grater on my nerves, but because it can easily kill a list.  I am
<br>
not banning religious speculation - but I am banning low-quality religious
<br>
speculation.  (Speculation which contains incorrect
<br>
spelling/grammar/punctuation will automatically be deemed to be low
<br>
quality.)
<br>
<p>I'm sorry to have to do this so early into the discussion, but no traffic
<br>
is better than bad traffic.
<br>
<p>Those of you who are long veterans of the war against fuzzy thinking
<br>
already know what I mean by all this.  Those list members who don't come
<br>
from scientific backgrounds - I expect we'll have at least a few - may be
<br>
somewhat confused as to what the fuss is about, or may think I'm saying
<br>
that all religious discussion is automatically unscientific.  Well, to
<br>
some extent, it is, in the sense that if you have a really logically
<br>
rigorous discussion about religion all the religious ideas will end up
<br>
being shot down, because the religious ideas are in fact wrong and we have
<br>
enough evidence to know it.  But that doesn't mean that it isn't possible
<br>
to discuss religion logically - or that people who disagree with my
<br>
evaluation of religion can't post logical, rigorous opposing viewpoints. 
<br>
(Samantha Atkins can still post.)
<br>
<p>So what exactly the problem?  The influence of anticipation on perception,
<br>
as I would put it; in plain English, &quot;wishful thinking&quot;.  Bad enough when
<br>
people engage in flagrant rationalization in support of a conclusion they
<br>
would wish to be true; even worse is just posting the conclusion without
<br>
bothering with the rationalization.
<br>
<p>Reasoning is a tool for telling us things we didn't previously know.  Not
<br>
for producing sentences that make us feel warm and fuzzy inside.  It is
<br>
acceptable to post a warm and fuzzy sentence, but it has to be supported,
<br>
and the standard to which that support is held will not be lowered.
<br>
<p>The Universe runs on its own rails; so must rationality.  If, in the due
<br>
course of time, unbiased reason happens to naturally produce a warm and
<br>
fuzzy conclusion, then by all means post the conclusion and the
<br>
reasoning.  The idea that pain and death can be eliminated is an example
<br>
of a conclusion that has been produced by both rationalization (in
<br>
religious prophecy) and unforced reasoning (we have the technology); the
<br>
former pseudologic does not invalidate the independent real logic.  (It
<br>
does mean that normative observers will legitimately be more skeptical of
<br>
the person professing such a heartwarming conclusion, until it has been
<br>
established to their satisfaction that the logic really is independent of
<br>
the desired answer.)
<br>
<p>A subtle example of rationalization might be asking the question:  &quot;Why is
<br>
there pain and suffering if it doesn't really need to be that way?&quot;, and
<br>
then offering the answer &quot;Because otherwise life would be boring.&quot;  To
<br>
meet the standards of the SL4 mailing list, the question must be phrased
<br>
as follows:  &quot;Postulating that our world is currently under the control of
<br>
an ultrapowerful entity, and supposing that this entity has values that
<br>
have at least some intersection with our own, why do we observe pain and
<br>
suffering?&quot;  Now, the simple answer is that our world is NOT under the
<br>
control of an ultrapowerful entity.  If under the control of an
<br>
ultrapowerful benevolent entity, we don't expect to see this world; we see
<br>
this world, and so the &quot;ultrapowerful benevolent entity&quot; hypothesis is
<br>
disconfirmed.  If you go on to postulate a possible exotic set of rules
<br>
under which a benevolent superintelligence might create/allow pain and
<br>
suffering, you have to treat this as an &quot;additional assumption&quot; under
<br>
Occam's Razor and note that the probability of the final scenario is
<br>
reduced accordingly, not say &quot;And so we see that pain and suffering are
<br>
really OK, and we're all still cradled in God's arms.&quot;
<br>
<p>Many philosophers throughout history, faced with a world of pain and death
<br>
from which there was apparently no escape, or having grown up with the
<br>
commanded assumption that there exists a superintelligence running our
<br>
world, have rationalized the existence of pain and suffering.  This is to
<br>
be expected.  But there is no reason why such theories should be allowed
<br>
to contaminate SL4.  I don't say that the *conclusions* are forever
<br>
forbidden, because there might be *independent* logic supporting them. 
<br>
But the theories as theories are known to involve twisted logic, and that
<br>
the pseudologic is not acceptable here.
