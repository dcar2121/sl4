</em><br>
<em>&gt; to look like it needs to for the level of beings inhabiting it might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the very essence and utterly necessary manifestation of caring. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     ...It is possible that making it too obvious this is a simulation or
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt; there is an SI would ruin the particular learning environment we currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inhabit.  So we get only hints, guesses, supposedly ancient truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buried in myths and seeming tall tales and so on....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     ....If we are in a sim then the pain and death are no more ultimately
</em><br>
real
<br>
<em>&gt; than getting fragged in Quake.  Except in Quake you aren't fully wired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in.
</em><br>
<p>The real can of worms this theory opens up is the &quot;kill em all and let Sysop
<br>
(God) sort em out&quot; mentality that the frightened and intolerant have used
<br>
throughout history.  Most religions today have at least some elements of
<br>
death-as-release, and certain individuals or groups have always chosen to
<br>
use these as justification for ending the lives of others -- despite the
<br>
obvious prohibitions against murder in these same belief systems.  &quot;I'm not
<br>
just doing the world a favor by killing you, I'm doing YOU a favor!  Now
<br>
show some gratitude, will ya?&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, the proven remedy to such blatant misuse of religion is to say
<br>
that the beliefs of others must be respected, and since there can be no
<br>
proof-based consensus on life after death, people shouldn't take chances
<br>
with it or have to worry about others who do.  If nothing else, death seems
<br>
pretty irreversible.  I wonder if anyone, spared from inquisition or
<br>
genocide thanks to religious freedoms, ever thinks to thank God for
<br>
unbelievers.
<br>
<p><p>Some questions to consider:
<br>
<p>1) If both a killer and a soon-to-be corpse are of the same mindset that
<br>
death is good, is it really murder?
<br>
<p>2) How about if the willing deceased has a backup somewhere?
<br>
<p>3) How about if this killer only thinks he has killed the person, when in
<br>
fact it is all a simulation?
<br>
<p>4) ...And if the killer DID know it was a simulation?
<br>
<p>5) How about if this killer had merely thought about killing the person, but
<br>
never made any preparations or acted upon it?
<br>
<p>6) Is there any difference between 4 and 5?
<br>
<p>I'm not well versed enough in eastern religions to say for sure how they
<br>
might respond, but I know that Jesus claimed that comitting evil one's heart
<br>
is as bad as reinacting it physically.  Is there even any evil in these
<br>
scenarios? What would a friendly Sysop think? Or do?
<br>
<p>[Yes, I do realize that Friendliness vs. Volition in a Sysop context has
<br>
already been speculated upon at length in this forum, but hey, it's been a
<br>
while...]
