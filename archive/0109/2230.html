What I meant originally is,
<br>
<p>&quot;if you've been reading this list for months, and you are continuing to read 
<br>
it, and you have an idea or topic which you think is beneficial to the list, 
<br>
don't be afraid to post it for fear of ridicule&quot;
<br>
<p>don't let my figurative language confuse you into thinking that I have any 
<br>
personal interest nor care as to who posts or who doesn't.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;You may be deeply disturbed and frightened if you wish.  However, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggest not letting my sarcasm push you into emotional despair.  Rather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chew on this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The AI-to-SI theories propagated by SL4 and others are VERY interesting to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wide spectrum of curious minds.  Those who see Friendly AI as the next step
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the human journey get a certain rush from such prospects.  And there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others who are just as curious, but for other reasons.  The so-called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mainstream of Catholics, Protestant Christians, Orthodox and Conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jews and Muslims are not likely to share the trans-human/post-human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enthusiasm, i.e., having machine intelligence replace human hierarchy, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to mention &quot;God&quot;.  The possibilities (even probabilities) of uploading
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans, etc. surpasses the nightmares these folks share about &quot;The End of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Days&quot; (at least in the biblical theory, God comes to the rescue).  In a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real fashion, AI &lt;is&gt; just that - THE END as defined by monotheism.  Once
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better understood by the &quot;moral majority&quot; the theories behind the R&amp;D of AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will likely be treated as the apotheosis if evil, an evil greater than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abortion, euthanasia, adultery, materialism, and the like, combined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When the concepts are better understood by greater numbers, organized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion will be forced to study the available documents and determine an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;official position.  This will have repercussions on many levels.  The most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obvious being the political level where AI R&amp;D will suffer in one form or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another under stricter &quot;moral&quot; guidelines. Where the Feds leave off, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religious zealots will pick-up.  It is not too far-fetched to imagine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of well-funded and connected &quot;believers&quot; hunting down and waging a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different kind of &quot;holy war&quot; on the scientists and proponents of AI (a holy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;war unlike the political/cultural being seen in the Muslim world/s, but one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which unites human beings who &quot;serve God&quot; against the &quot;blasphemers&quot; who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;willing sell-out the human race [which, after all, it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;justified/rationalized, is created by the Holy One in His Image...really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Their Image/s...but that's theological nitpicking]).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This moment in time might very well be the proverbial good-old-days when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;folks could hunker-down on their work station and share their thoughts and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dreams about AI without fear.  For there may soon come a time when people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are identified as either &quot;serving The Lord&quot; or &quot;serving Satan&quot; in the hunt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to rid the race of traitors.  Unless one is working behind the secured 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;walls
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of a major corporate and/or government/military facility, a person may find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;him/herself in a world of sh*t, that is, at the mercy of folks who truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe they are saving the human race from extinction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My understanding (don't get frightened here), as limited as it may be, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that a number of Bishops and Cardinals are currently reviewing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concept/s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;related to AI and &quot;spiritual machines&quot; and will be formulating an official
</em><br>
<em>&gt;response to the &quot;dangers&quot; of such research.  A statement may be issued by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rome (to be followed by others elsewhere) within a year (they tend to move
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about as quickly as any government bureaucracy).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the beginning, there won't be much to worry about.  Social movements
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(consider anti-abortionists as an example) take some time to organize...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;BTW, I'm getting back to work...not because &quot;I'm unimportant&quot;, but because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have a beautiful wife and precious daughter to support.  Now if that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distresses you, email me personally.

<em>&gt; &gt;The brain power necessary for this will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;probably find these words to be irritating.  So I'll get back to my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am deeply disturbed and frightened by this comment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I often find self-describing 'bystanders' posting on this list, following
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their often important thought with something along the lines of &quot;but I'm no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one to speak&quot; or &quot;I probably don't know what I'm talking about&quot; or &quot;I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;getting back to my work because the people who actually write AI will sneer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at my post&quot;. The individuals on the Friendly AI project under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence are not superhuman. We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a small team of computer programmers, self-educated cognitive scientists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethusiasts. Although I will not dispute that bright engineers and designers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are necessary to create true Friendly AI, we are still people with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incomplete view of the world and posts to this list are not laffable nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shunned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am always happy and interested to read the various essays and viewpoints
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posted here. Please, all future posters, do not terminate your messages 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I'm getting back to work, I am unimportant&quot; or something similar because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that only causes me distress.
