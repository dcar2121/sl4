<p>
Speaking as one of the list lurkers and Singulitarian wanna-be's, I want to
<br>
sincerely encourage you, or someone (else not me) to properly maintain this
<br>
to-do list. Your initial list is extremely general of course, so maybe if a
<br>
discussion thread was started to address each task that is added to the list, it
<br>
would give some of us a clue as to how we could possibly fit in. I would like to
<br>
make some comments on your short list of tasks though:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Code a Transhuman AI.
</em><br>
Um, sure. How do we do that, exactly? In one short paragraph, please ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Figure out how to program Friendliness into an AI.
</em><br>
Pre-requisite before even thinking about beginning this task is to read a very
<br>
long paper, several times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Write a Seed AI.
</em><br>
Is this before, or after the Transhuman AI? ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Get funding!!!
</em><br>
This is definately worthy of a new discussion thread or even a new forum set up
<br>
by SingInst.org.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Write articles about Singularity related topics to make sure they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fully understood (for example, take some involved discussion on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list, sort out the conclusions, and write it up in a coherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner).
</em><br>
This one truly makes me cringe. As much as I appreciate the in-depth discussions
<br>
and the papers being written, I am personally overwhelmed by it all to the point
<br>
of feeling useless, and one could assume that most lurkers are too. Maybe it is
<br>
more of a presentation issue. Not enough pictures and diagrams, and too many
<br>
words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * [Your items here].
</em><br>
Regarding writing articles about The Singularity, they seem to be oriented
<br>
towards an elite SL4 group. How about introductory texts or summaries that would
<br>
appeal to the other levels, all the way down to SL0? The purpose of writing
<br>
about The Singularity is to increase understanding by all humans, not just the
<br>
SL4. Ideally, the more people at the SL4 level, the more resources we have to
<br>
achieving the rest of our goals towards the Singularity.
<br>
<p>I would also like to see a SL4-list member profile page. When someone
<br>
subscribes, they can enter public profile information that includes information
<br>
on their enthusiasm, skills, and availability as a resource for the Singularity
<br>
project leader(s).
<br>
<p><p>I hate to keep the &quot;do something&quot; banter going, but I think I can summarize it
<br>
so far and how it could end up thus:
<br>
Anonymous: Somebody ought to do something!
<br>
Singulitarian Activist: Don't tell us what to do, do something yourself!
<br>
Anonymous: I can't do anything, I'm busy doing other things. You do it. I'll
<br>
&quot;support&quot; you.
<br>
Singulitarian Activist: You can support me by becoming an Activist. You ought to
<br>
do something!
<br>
Anonymous: You obviously don't appreciate my support, I give up, good luck with
<br>
The Singularity.
<br>
<p>The point I'm trying to make here (and in fact this whole posting) is that &quot;do
<br>
this very complex task, faster!&quot;, is going to cause any meaningful communication
<br>
between current and potential activists to balk. Here's how we would like to see
<br>
it:
<br>
Anonymous: Somebody ought to do something!
<br>
Singulitarian Activist: I'm trying, but we need help. If you can do this very,
<br>
very small task that practically anyone at your skill level can do quickly, you
<br>
would be appreciated.
<br>
Anonymous: Well, I dunno, I'm a bit busy right now...
<br>
Singulitarian Activist: OK, can you do this even smaller task? Or can you donate
<br>
up to $1? You'll be forever recognized in the README file ...
<br>
Anonymous: Well, OK, I guess I can do/donate that...
<br>
&lt;time passes by ...&gt;
<br>
Singulitarian Activist: Hey, remember when you did that thing? We really
<br>
appreciate it. Can you do it again? Or even better, do this more important task
<br>
instead?
<br>
Anonymous: Well, since I had such a positive experience with my last
<br>
contribution, I think I could make an effort to manage my busy schedule to fit
<br>
in this task ...
<br>
<p>I guess this falls under the category of persuasion techniques and people
<br>
management. Hold a competition, a sweepstakes, and most importantly, find small
<br>
easy tasks that you can hook people in to the cause so that you can ask them to
<br>
contribute slightly more again next time. Don't ever expect anyone to see
<br>
&quot;create complex procedure&quot; and expect them to have it done 6 months later.
<br>
<p><p>I'm also curious as to what certain people's day jobs are, and how they manage
<br>
their time to balance work on the Singularity and the rest of &quot;real life&quot;.
