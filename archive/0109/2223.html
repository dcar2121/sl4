<em>&gt; SPOILER REPLY:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I liked the movie OK, but it didn't live up to my expectations (after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading Eliezer's nonspoiler and semispoiler review). I suppose if I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watched it having no idea it would involve sci-fi element, I would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been pleasantly surprised.
</em><br>
<p>Oops.  In retrospect, I can see that you are completely correct about
<br>
this.  But it does make it rather hard to recommend the movie!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; If Alcor doesn't know about &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; forthcoming US version,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; **someone really ought to** tell them NOW
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey now... :)
</em><br>
<p>Well, originally that post was supposed to go to cryonet, but then it
<br>
bounced, and the message I sent to someone asking them to forward it also
<br>
bounced, and furthermore I don't know anyone at Alcor.  But you are
<br>
nonetheless completely right about this, and I have forwarded on the
<br>
review, with explanation, to the best email address I could find at
<br>
Alcor's website.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I thought the movie would make more sense. Would anyone really sign up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the splicing option?
</em><br>
<p>NOT ME.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do they delete the whole chunk of memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between before you signed up and when you died which would normally be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years?
</em><br>
<p>I get the impression they just delete the memory of having signed up, or
<br>
the memory of requesting a splice at any rate.  (If you're signed up for
<br>
Alcor and your memory says that Alcor doesn't offer the splice option on
<br>
the contract, it means that you have died and are now living in a computer
<br>
simulation.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Didn't the guy in the bar give him enough of a clue, or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough of a temptation to try controlling things with his mind again?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From our perspective, yes.  But we are experienced Extropians.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; And of course, why, oh why did he have to jump from a building to wake up?
</em><br>
<p>Either dramatic plot device, or some kind of psychological method for
<br>
severing the connections to the old world before waking up.  Almost
<br>
certainly the former.  Still, you can rationalize quite a lot on the
<br>
assumption of SL3 gross psychosurgery rather than uploading.
<br>
<p>[SPOILER FOR &quot;THE SIXTH SENSE&quot;]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, &quot;The sixth sense&quot;, *that* was a GREAT &quot;character has big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realization about splice in their existence&quot; movie!
</em><br>
<p>[SPOILER FOR &quot;THE OTHERS&quot;]
<br>
<p>&quot;The Others&quot; is by the same director as &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;.
