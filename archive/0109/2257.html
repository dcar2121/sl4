<em>&gt;&lt;&lt; Eliezer's proposed singularity leaves room for voluntary pain (for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sadomasochist types) &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;My question is somewhat simpler. Is there an actual estimated crossover point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of 'operations per second' where the Singularity must occur? Is there a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;calculated range where it could occur?  If someone has estimated this level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of processing, what are the calculations per second?
</em><br>
<p>Probably.  It is likely that the Singularity can be attained by brute 
<br>
force use of a genetic algorithm (or, hopefully, a smarter version of 
<br>
this idea).  This is not really desirable, but it could be done. 
<br>
This would require a lot of processing power, so we'd have to wait 20 
<br>
or 30 years before the effort could even start.
<br>
<p>What is more likely and the faster solution is to try to jump into 
<br>
the Singularity.  By this I mean that it doesn't matter how slow the 
<br>
AI that is going to take us to the Singularity is, but the nature of 
<br>
its programming is different in a fundamental way (namely, it can 
<br>
rewrite its own code).  If we do this, we're on the fast track to the 
<br>
Singularity (depending on a number of factors, anywhere from 2-5 
<br>
years to a few of hours).
<br>
<p>Earlier I said probably because there is the chance that programs 
<br>
that can program themselves are outside the problem space of current 
<br>
languages.  In other words, we may need a more powerful language 
<br>
(i.e. we need GlooP).  If that's the case, then we need Flare badly 
<br>
(assuming it will make what I describe possible).  This seems to be 
<br>
what Eliezer thinks (correct me if I'm wrong), while Ben takes the 
<br>
stance from the previous paragraph.
<br>
<p>Hope that sums things up for you.  This has been discussed before, 
<br>
but in bits an pieces.
