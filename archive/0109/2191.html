Thinking alone may not bring about an Artificial Intelligence Singularity, but
<br>
it could bring about a Human Intelligence Singularity. Self-replicating
<br>
Drexlerian assemblers in matter and energy space is isomorphic to humans that
<br>
breed and keep humanity from extinction, and also isomorphic to programmers or
<br>
Seed AI creating a better AI. I know that most people here believe that an AI
<br>
Singularity will happen sooner than a HI Singularity. Personally, I'm interested
<br>
in both.
<br>
<p>I have understood The Singularity as the point in time where the path taken
<br>
creates an intelligence greater than the most highly optimized intelligent
<br>
individual human. Please correct me if my interpretation is too general or
<br>
specific or wrong.
<br>
<p>Isn't thinking the most important step towards The Singularity? It is seeded by
<br>
thinking, which creates knowledge. With enough knowledge, anything can happen
<br>
including the implementation of these thoughts into machines in meat-space. The
<br>
reason these machines may or do not exist yet is because we don't have enough
<br>
knowledge brought about by thinking. Implementation details can be performed by
<br>
trial and error or experimentation, but thinking about the implementation
<br>
details will make the construction practically trivial.
<br>
<p>Having completely automated self-replicating systems requires intelligence, even
<br>
if it is Artificial. We just need to make sure it is Friendly before pressing
<br>
the start button, or else humanity ends up like Mickey Mouse in Fantasia's The
<br>
Sorcerer's Apprentice. That is why while there is no Friendly AI yet, we need a
<br>
lot of people to run it to contain it and to press the stop button.

<em>&gt; Thinking alone won't bring about a Singularity, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to implement the thoughts in the world of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and energy.  While Drexlerian assemblers are still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undeveloped, we have a macroscopic self-replicating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system in our industrial infrastructure.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrastructure still requires a lot of people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run it, though.  What I am interested in is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-replicating systems that are entirely automated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially ones that are relatively small and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fast reproduction times.
