<em> &gt; I'm making myself rich enough to make sizable donations.
</em><br>
<p>I was trying that strategy too. I made enough money in NASDAQ to make a 
<br>
sizable (depending on your definition) donation but then I lost it. I 
<br>
made some very small percentage donations back then and some more 
<br>
recently. However, there are other good reasons to donate earlier rather 
<br>
than later:
<br>
<p>1. Even though I assume you are doing it out of altruism, you get more 
<br>
credit points if you donate now rather than later if SIAI or WebMind 
<br>
(Real AI Institute) is more established.
<br>
2. Your donation will have a larger impact now than later when SIAI has 
<br>
more money. Your &quot;sizable&quot; donation may need to be a lot more &quot;sizable&quot; 
<br>
to be considered &quot;sizable&quot;.
<br>
3. SIAI could do useful things with your money now. Frontloading is 
<br>
important.
<br>
4. Have you set a target amount and date? If you have some money and are 
<br>
getting richer incrementally, you should donate as you go along as 
<br>
opposed to delaying the decision. Or are you waiting to be more 
<br>
confident in your beliefs and acting on them? (which was more my case)
<br>
5. If SIAI can meet their schedule goal, you don't have much time. 
<br>
(Actually, there may only be a few more years where your or my actions 
<br>
can have any moral significance -- extinction or &quot;mission accomplished&quot; 
<br>
ends that.)
<br>
