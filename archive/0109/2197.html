Simon says (hehe)
<br>
Regarding writing articles about The Singularity, they seem to be oriented
<br>
towards an elite SL4 group. How about introductory texts or summaries that
<br>
would
<br>
appeal to the other levels, all the way down to SL0? The purpose of writing
<br>
about The Singularity is to increase understanding by all humans, not just
<br>
the
<br>
SL4. Ideally, the more people at the SL4 level, the more resources we have
<br>
to
<br>
achieving the rest of our goals towards the Singularity.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Simon,
<br>
&nbsp;obviously I can't speak for Eli (he talk pretty damn good heself)
<br>
but I suspect the pat response here goes something along the lines
<br>
of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The rescources to assist people at various Shock Levels already
<br>
exist a plenty. Be it normal science fiction, science education, or
<br>
various stock transhumanist essays etc.  The materials about the
<br>
list seem to focus on an SL4 perspective because that's where the
<br>
tip of the spear is. Various people at SL3 (like me) just require
<br>
repeated exposure to SL4 concepts till they get over their
<br>
mental blocks. The other Shock Levels have their own exponents.
<br>
If We waste time duplicating effort already made by others then we
<br>
retard the Needful Work of actualizing a safe sane Singularity etc. etc.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or so I would guess. I'm still trying to cope with large cities and
<br>
the tradeoff between having lots of trees around at the end of the
<br>
day and having lots of money. :) SL3 (with occasional SL(-2)
<br>
fugues).
