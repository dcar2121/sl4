<p>
For a while now, I've been having to write things, and not the unfinished
<br>
chapters of &quot;General Intelligence and Seed AI&quot;, either.  Writing GISAI, or
<br>
working out the design of the initial AI so that the project is in more
<br>
initiable form, is the archetypal example of a task that I cannot hand off
<br>
to someone else; it is locked up in Eliezer Yudkowsky's head.
<br>
<p>But if I can hand off anything else, I can get more done on GISAI.
<br>
<p>The problem with writing is that it takes a lot of practice to be a good
<br>
writer; that you need to write a million words to throw away before you
<br>
can write good words.  I'm probably still working on my million, but after
<br>
six years of writing about the Singularity, I would say I've gotten
<br>
reasonably good at it.  The problem now is that when I have to write
<br>
something about the Singularity, it's difficult to hand off the problem to
<br>
anyone else.  So what I wish is that people would start practicing now,
<br>
even if it takes a while before they can contribute webpages directly to
<br>
SIAI's site, so that two years from now I can hand things off to them.
<br>
<p>I'd like to see more webpages written about the Singularity from the
<br>
SL4/Singularitarian viewpoint, partially so that there's a larger universe
<br>
of work out there which more people can run across, and partially so that
<br>
there's a pool of practiced writers to take the load off.  The
<br>
Extropian/transhumanist group has a small army independently producing
<br>
creative and intelligent work, which they built up over the course of
<br>
years.  We should start now.
<br>
<p>Flare is a good example of something short-term where there's immediate
<br>
work to be done on the programming side.  I haven't been able to hand off
<br>
Flare entirely, mostly because nobody has yet taken on the task of
<br>
understanding the whole language design and independently inventing new
<br>
pieces of it and thus being able to, e.g., write the language definition. 
<br>
So I've been producing raw material and hoping that, at least by the time
<br>
the prototype is being built, someone other than me will be able to write
<br>
the language definition.  That's the part that I personally want to give
<br>
away.  Dmitriy would know more about whether there are any short-term
<br>
strictly programming tasks that can be handed off to someone else.
