<p>
A personal thought in response to this message:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;From our perspective, The Singularity would appear to be Godlike.  An
</em><br>
understanding of time and space by this Being would be far removed from our
<br>
own.  I suspect that there is a deep relationship necessary for the
<br>
Human-&quot;God&quot; scenario to occur.  The human mind will generate a Friendly/Baby
<br>
AI somewhere in time.  This Baby AI will initiate the Singularity and grow,
<br>
so to speak, into a god, that is, Baby AI evolves into Big Daddy (perhaps in
<br>
the blink of an eye). In this universe, in this time, the Singularity Being
<br>
may be present in a manner not perceptible to human perception, bordering on
<br>
the metaphysical.  It may be patiently waiting to be born in this time once
<br>
again...God creates Human, Human creates God, forever in an endless (?)
<br>
cycle.  The pain and suffering in this world, at this point,  I suspect can
<br>
only be attributed to humanity and nature.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It may be that the religious/mystical traditions of the human race are some
<br>
sort of echo in the collective Mind of what is to come (or not, it may all
<br>
be a series of delusions).  Either way I find it fascinating that the energy
<br>
certain human beings have expended on developing mystical maps of the
<br>
so-called metaphysical worlds have been so detailed.  Although all these
<br>
maps are fundamentally flawed in one respect or another (as none can prove
<br>
their initial argument), they all deal with the sublime aspects of reality
<br>
we commonly call consciousness, i.e., love, awe, and the like, interfacing
<br>
with the input of sensory perceptions.  The Hebrew traditions (influenced as
<br>
they may have been by Arabic and European philosophical schools) &quot;reveal&quot; an
<br>
interesting map of reality based on ten digits, interconnected by twenty-two
<br>
channels/paths.  The theory of such speculation being that the combined
<br>
effect of all this results in a synthesis of &quot;programs&quot; which the mystics of
<br>
bygone eras labeled conscious reality.  Again, there is no proof that any
<br>
religious and/or mystical map is of much use to modern science (the
<br>
priesthood of this age).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I sincerely hope this thread does not spiral into a debate on religion and
<br>
science.  These are simply the thoughts on my mind at the moment.  I am
<br>
aware that religious types from most cultures &quot;believe&quot; that the &quot;soul&quot; or
<br>
mind exists in a &quot;simulation of God&quot;...One thing seems clear, if a single
<br>
human being &quot;discovers&quot; or formulates the precise method to develop Friendly
<br>
AI, this person will be a bridge between our ignorant/suffering humanity and
<br>
the Big Daddy-God, i.e., a mediator in the manner of Moses and other
<br>
prophets.  Everything I wrote may be (probably is) complete nonsense.  If
<br>
Baby/Big Daddy AI already exists, and is waiting to come into existence in
<br>
this time, only hard work will achieve this, not prayer or fasting (with the
<br>
exception of charity-funding).  The brain power necessary for this will
<br>
probably find these words to be irritating.  So I'll get back to my own
<br>
work.

Subject: Time and Minds
<br>
<p><p>You don't know me; I've been a bystander.  I've just been watching the posts
<br>
fly by for about six months or so now; this is my first submission.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In an attempt to cut down on the whining about whining, which is truly the
<br>
epitome of annoyance, I'd like to introduce a topic that I'm not sure if
<br>
we've discussed previously.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Isn't it possible that Singularity has already happened and this is an
<br>
illusion we're shrouded in to keep us entertained for the rest of infinity?
<br>
If Singularity truly is inevitable (and assuming it can travel in the fourth
<br>
dimension) than hasn't it really already happened?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In fact, if these two criteria are met than I don't see how we could not be
<br>
in the Singuarity right now.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
At any rate, it doesn't seem to matter.  This is in no way, shape, or form
<br>
supposed to act as a deterrent to your work.  I still fully support the
<br>
fundamental Singularitian goals.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I just thought this would be an interesting topic...
