Eliezer certainly has the right to call us all to account, since his
<br>
commitment to Friendly AI is total.
<br>
<p>My commitment is necessarily much less, as I am neither rich, nor a
<br>
high-level programmer, nor a public figure. I do contribute small amounts to
<br>
ExI and, moments ago, gave money directly to SIAI via the website PayPal
<br>
link.
<br>
<p>As a university instructor in technical communication, I have also made a
<br>
point of giving a PowerPoint presentation about the Singularity at the end
<br>
of my courses every semester, in the hope that some of my science and
<br>
engineering students may be inspired to apply their skills to this goal. (I
<br>
don't mention SIAI, since I know that Eliezer has been sensitive about the
<br>
potential for stirring up opposition and has criticized me directly in the
<br>
past; I use Kurzweil, Drexler, Moravec and Vinge instead.)
<br>
<p>What I am saying, in essence, is that I am doing what I am capable of within
<br>
the constraints of my life circumstances (earning a living, supporting wife
<br>
and 3 children, etc.). I wish I could do more. Unless or until I find a way
<br>
to do more, all I can offer is what I can spare. Maybe it's not enough-it's
<br>
certainly not a lot. But perhaps over time if enough of us add our own
<br>
portion to what Eliezer and Brian and others are doing, we can give them
<br>
just enough to do the job.
<br>
<p>A pious hope? A self-justification? No, just an admission of limits and an
<br>
intention to overcome.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael LaTorra

Subject: &quot;Someone ought to do something&quot; posts
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;
<br>
What's the point of writing &quot;someone ought to do X&quot; or &quot;the transhumanist
<br>
community ought to do X&quot; or &quot;Singularitarians ought to do X&quot;?  What good
<br>
does it do?  Which existing project should we halt to work on X?  The
<br>
people who have crossed over to doing something about it are not idle;
<br>
they are working on whatever it was that moved them to cross over.
<br>
<p>&quot;Someone ought to do X&quot; is not news.  &quot;I am doing X&quot; is news.  Let SL4 be
<br>
a refuge for the latter.
