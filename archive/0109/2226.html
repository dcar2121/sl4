<p>One thing I see as key is that a lot of the discussion about general 
<br>
topics that needs to take place probably has.  What has yet to come 
<br>
is discussion about specifics (how do I code Friendliness into AI x). 
<br>
Luckily, as Eli has pointed out before, most of us simply can't 
<br>
contribute to these discussion (myself included most of the time, 
<br>
unless I'm overestimating the task of creating AI, which I doubt). 
<br>
So, when the time comes, this probably won't be as bad as it could be 
<br>
since we won't need to communicate in such open forums.
<br>
<p>On a side note, some religions may see the results of the 
<br>
Singularity, if presented in the right light, as actually being a 
<br>
good thing.  But, I've been an atheist for years (although I didn't 
<br>
always know it), so all I know about religion I learned as a little 
<br>
kid watching TV (it's amazing how much religion there is in 
<br>
children's programming) and from Sarah, who likes to thump her Bible 
<br>
on occasion, but she's a Thomas Paine kind of believer (not to be 
<br>
confused with my previous reference to Thomas Paine), so it's not 
<br>
quite so bad as having fundies come at you.  Thus, I probably have a 
<br>
less than accurate view of most religions.
