</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?
</em><br>
<p>Okay, this all needs to be said very carefully, so as not to give the
<br>
wrong impression.  I don't want to sound like I think Earth is hell. 
<br>
Earth contains fun.  My life even contains unusual and exceptional pieces
<br>
of fun, such as having a large impact in the ultimate scheme of things,
<br>
knowing how the mind really works, and so on.
<br>
<p>But life is unpleasant, sometimes very unpleasant.  And life is not a
<br>
trade, where you agree to experience some unpleasant things in exchange
<br>
for the good parts.  That is simply a nitwit philosophical idea that was
<br>
dreamed up to rationalize away the discomfort from living with gratuitous
<br>
unpleasantness that humanity was powerless to do anything about.  Pain is
<br>
not necessary for growth, or to give life meaning, or to teach us
<br>
responsibility, or any other nitwit philosophical reason.  If you were
<br>
constructing a world from scratch it would not contain child abuse and it
<br>
would not contain stubbed toes either.  The reason our world contains pain
<br>
is not that pain is meaningful, but that our world is ordered by the laws
<br>
of physics and nothing else.
<br>
<p>I am not willing to consider even the smallest inconveniences of my life
<br>
as an adequate trade for the fun I've had.  They are flaws.  They
<br>
shouldn't be here, they should be debugged and removed from the Universe. 
<br>
And similarly, the fun I have, regardless of how it measures up compared
<br>
to an &quot;average&quot; pre-Singularity life, is not the amount of fun that a
<br>
citizen of the universe should have, and it is not the quality of fun that
<br>
a citizen of the universe should have.  I will not forgive the willpower
<br>
expenditure that makes it painful to work on the things I want to work
<br>
on.  I will not forgive losing neurons with age.  I will not forgive the
<br>
hard-earned memories that have blurred with time and are not backed up
<br>
anywhere.  I will not forgive having to hurry through my life, instead of
<br>
being able to take as much time as necessary.  These things are not
<br>
optimal even for growth of personality.
<br>
<p>Some of the unpleasantness in my life is due to choices I made willingly,
<br>
but I will not forgive any entity that turns out to be responsible for
<br>
having made those choices necessary.  We are not, by any stretch of
<br>
rationalization, living in an optimal or even a reasonably pleasant and
<br>
purposeful world.  We are living in a planetary slum by any sane cosmic
<br>
standard, and we will continue to be stuck there until we do something
<br>
about it.  And anyone who created that world, and/or my own life, or even
<br>
recreated it, is not acting under any morals that I recognize.
