You may be deeply disturbed and frightened if you wish.  However, I would
<br>
suggest not letting my sarcasm push you into emotional despair.  Rather,
<br>
chew on this:  
<br>
<p>The AI-to-SI theories propagated by SL4 and others are VERY interesting to a
<br>
wide spectrum of curious minds.  Those who see Friendly AI as the next step
<br>
in the human journey get a certain rush from such prospects.  And there are
<br>
others who are just as curious, but for other reasons.  The so-called
<br>
mainstream of Catholics, Protestant Christians, Orthodox and Conservative
<br>
Jews and Muslims are not likely to share the trans-human/post-human
<br>
enthusiasm, i.e., having machine intelligence replace human hierarchy, not
<br>
to mention &quot;God&quot;.  The possibilities (even probabilities) of uploading
<br>
humans, etc. surpasses the nightmares these folks share about &quot;The End of
<br>
Days&quot; (at least in the biblical theory, God comes to the rescue).  In a very
<br>
real fashion, AI &lt;is&gt; just that - THE END as defined by monotheism.  Once
<br>
better understood by the &quot;moral majority&quot; the theories behind the R&amp;D of AI
<br>
will likely be treated as the apotheosis if evil, an evil greater than
<br>
abortion, euthanasia, adultery, materialism, and the like, combined.
<br>
<p>When the concepts are better understood by greater numbers, organized
<br>
religion will be forced to study the available documents and determine an
<br>
official position.  This will have repercussions on many levels.  The most
<br>
obvious being the political level where AI R&amp;D will suffer in one form or
<br>
another under stricter &quot;moral&quot; guidelines. Where the Feds leave off, the
<br>
religious zealots will pick-up.  It is not too far-fetched to imagine groups
<br>
of well-funded and connected &quot;believers&quot; hunting down and waging a very
<br>
different kind of &quot;holy war&quot; on the scientists and proponents of AI (a holy
<br>
war unlike the political/cultural being seen in the Muslim world/s, but one
<br>
which unites human beings who &quot;serve God&quot; against the &quot;blasphemers&quot; who
<br>
willing sell-out the human race [which, after all, it will be
<br>
justified/rationalized, is created by the Holy One in His Image...really
<br>
Their Image/s...but that's theological nitpicking]).
<br>
<p>This moment in time might very well be the proverbial good-old-days when
<br>
folks could hunker-down on their work station and share their thoughts and
<br>
dreams about AI without fear.  For there may soon come a time when people
<br>
are identified as either &quot;serving The Lord&quot; or &quot;serving Satan&quot; in the hunt
<br>
to rid the race of traitors.  Unless one is working behind the secured walls
<br>
of a major corporate and/or government/military facility, a person may find
<br>
him/herself in a world of sh*t, that is, at the mercy of folks who truly
<br>
believe they are saving the human race from extinction.
<br>
<p>My understanding (don't get frightened here), as limited as it may be, is
<br>
that a number of Bishops and Cardinals are currently reviewing the concept/s
<br>
related to AI and &quot;spiritual machines&quot; and will be formulating an official
<br>
response to the &quot;dangers&quot; of such research.  A statement may be issued by
<br>
Rome (to be followed by others elsewhere) within a year (they tend to move
<br>
about as quickly as any government bureaucracy).  
<br>
<p>In the beginning, there won't be much to worry about.  Social movements
<br>
(consider anti-abortionists as an example) take some time to organize...
<br>
<p>BTW, I'm getting back to work...not because &quot;I'm unimportant&quot;, but because I
<br>
have a beautiful wife and precious daughter to support.  Now if that
<br>
distresses you, email me personally.

<p><p><em>&gt;The brain power necessary for this will

I am deeply disturbed and frightened by this comment.
<br>
<p>I often find self-describing 'bystanders' posting on this list, following 
<br>
their often important thought with something along the lines of &quot;but I'm no 
<br>
one to speak&quot; or &quot;I probably don't know what I'm talking about&quot; or &quot;I'm 
<br>
getting back to my work because the people who actually write AI will sneer 
<br>
at my post&quot;. The individuals on the Friendly AI project under the 
<br>
Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence are not superhuman. We are
<br>
<p>a small team of computer programmers, self-educated cognitive scientists and
<br>
<p>ethusiasts. Although I will not dispute that bright engineers and designers 
<br>
are necessary to create true Friendly AI, we are still people with an 
<br>
incomplete view of the world and posts to this list are not laffable nor 
<br>
shunned.
<br>
<p>I am always happy and interested to read the various essays and viewpoints 
<br>
posted here. Please, all future posters, do not terminate your messages with
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm getting back to work, I am unimportant&quot; or something similar because 
<br>
that only causes me distress.
