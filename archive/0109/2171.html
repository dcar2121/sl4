<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news.html?id%3D495">http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=news.html?id%3D495</a>
<br>
<p>KurzweilAI.net recently posted a news item regarding Stephen Hawkings'
<br>
comments on preventing computers from taking over, based on an interview
<br>
originally published in the German magazine Focus. KurzweilAI.net has since
<br>
learned that his comments were inaccurately reported in the media.
<br>
<p>To ensure accuracy, we asked Prof. Hawking to provide his original comments.
<br>
They were:
<br>
<p>&quot;With genetic engineering, we will be able to increase the complexity of our
<br>
DNA, and improve the human race. But it will be a slow process, because one
<br>
will have to wait about 18 years, to see the effect of changes to the
<br>
genetic code. By contrast, computers double their speed and memories every
<br>
18 months. There is a real danger that computers will develop intelligence,
<br>
and take over. We urgently need to develop direct connections to the brain,
<br>
so that computers can add to human intelligence, rather than be in
<br>
opposition.&quot;
<br>
<p>His comments were in response to this question from Focus magazine:
<br>
<p>&quot;You mention a new species, which shall follow mankind one day. What do you
<br>
think is more probable: Robot beings, endowed with a superior artificial
<br>
intelligence, or by means of genetic engineering, an artificially evolved
<br>
human super race with superior cognitive and other brain functions?&quot; (Typos
<br>
corrected.)
<br>
<p>Several newspapers and news services reported that Stephen Hawking said
<br>
&quot;humans should change their DNA through genetic modification to keep ahead
<br>
of advances in computer technology and stop intelligent machines from
<br>
'taking over the world.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Something was evidently lost in the English-to-German-to-English
<br>
translation. Hawking in fact recommended direct connections to the brain to
<br>
avert computers taking over, with genetic engineering as a longer-term
<br>
solution.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is more in line with my thinking than what was reported,&quot; said Ray
<br>
Kurzweil, who had noted on KurzweilAI.net that &quot;Hawking’s recommendation to
<br>
do genetic engineering on humans in order to keep pace with AI is
<br>
unrealistic. He appears to be talking about genetic engineering through the
<br>
birth cycle, which would be absurdly slow. By the time the first genetically
<br>
engineered generation grows up, the era of beyond-human-level machines will
<br>
be upon us.&quot;
