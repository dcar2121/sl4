</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; to learn better ways of being and/or be open to some &quot;rewiring&quot;.  In my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opinion any Friendly SI that comes into being with coexistent lesser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sentients will hit on some variant of this solution.  Far from showing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the SI to be uncaring, relative non-intervention and allowing the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to look like it needs to for the level of beings inhabiting it might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the very essence and utterly necessary manifestation of caring. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     ...It is possible that making it too obvious this is a simulation or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is an SI would ruin the particular learning environment we currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inhabit.  So we get only hints, guesses, supposedly ancient truths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; buried in myths and seeming tall tales and so on....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     ....If we are in a sim then the pain and death are no more ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than getting fragged in Quake.  Except in Quake you aren't fully wired
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real can of worms this theory opens up is the &quot;kill em all and let Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (God) sort em out&quot; mentality that the frightened and intolerant have used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throughout history.  Most religions today have at least some elements of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death-as-release, and certain individuals or groups have always chosen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use these as justification for ending the lives of others -- despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious prohibitions against murder in these same belief systems.  &quot;I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just doing the world a favor by killing you, I'm doing YOU a favor!  Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show some gratitude, will ya?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  Except for one thing.  In the scenario outlined above this tactic 
<br>
doesn't really work.  You will not &quot;graduate&quot; from this matter of existence
<br>
with it attendant suffering as long as you employ such tactics.  After
<br>
enough go-rounds it is likely you will choose differently.  Death is not
<br>
release but time for evaluation and for living out consequences/further 
<br>
learning opportunities in another life.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Of course, the proven remedy to such blatant misuse of religion is to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the beliefs of others must be respected, and since there can be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof-based consensus on life after death, people shouldn't take chances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with it or have to worry about others who do.  If nothing else, death seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty irreversible.  I wonder if anyone, spared from inquisition or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genocide thanks to religious freedoms, ever thinks to thank God for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unbelievers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That deat seems irreversible doesn't mean it is or that it will always
<br>
be so.  Unbelievers who believe that this life is it (plus or minus 
<br>
cryonics, longevity advancements, uploading and so on) are also likely
<br>
to believe that just offing their enemies gets rid of them for good 
<br>
and, if they don't get caught or punished locally, then the strategy
<br>
has paid off.  Relatively materialistic and atheistic regimes do not
<br>
have a very sterling history for sparing people from genocide either.
<br>
This suggest that what leads to genocide is orthogonal to religious 
<br>
belief or the lack of same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some questions to consider:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) If both a killer and a soon-to-be corpse are of the same mindset that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death is good, is it really murder?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Without backup, certainly.  With backup?  It depends on motivations and
<br>
wishes of the people involved.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 2) How about if the willing deceased has a backup somewhere?
</em><br>
<p>Uncertain. Probably not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) How about if this killer only thinks he has killed the person, when in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact it is all a simulation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The the killer still committed murder as far as the consequence to
<br>
ver.  The simulation IS the reality of these persons.  To kill the
<br>
other against their will is to deprive the other of their life in
<br>
at least that context.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) ...And if the killer DID know it was a simulation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It depends on the contracts applicable to the simulation.  But
<br>
generally forcing another even in a sim to forego their life (in the
<br>
sim or not) against their will is wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) How about if this killer had merely thought about killing the person, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never made any preparations or acted upon it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It depends on the contracts of the simulation and the consequences
<br>
of such thoughts.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 6) Is there any difference between 4 and 5?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  There is a difference from thinking about a possible act, even
<br>
in a sim, and carrying it out.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'm not well versed enough in eastern religions to say for sure how they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might respond, but I know that Jesus claimed that comitting evil one's heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is as bad as reinacting it physically.  Is there even any evil in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios? What would a friendly Sysop think? Or do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If it has negative repurcussions on the inviduals involved then those
<br>
negative repurcussions are one possible indicator of or perhaps 
<br>
somewhat definitive of &quot;evil&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Yes, I do realize that Friendliness vs. Volition in a Sysop context has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already been speculated upon at length in this forum, but hey, it's been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while...]
