<p>While I agree that this sort of post is not helpful, we do need a to 
<br>
do list for the Singularitarian community.  There are probably plenty 
<br>
of people out there who say &quot;I want to see the Singularity get here 
<br>
sooner&quot; but at the same time say &quot;I don't know what to do&quot;.  I'm sure 
<br>
we must have plenty of stuff to do, even if it may require people 
<br>
educating themselves a bit more to the level of Eli or Brian or Ben 
<br>
(or me :-) (or someone I left out)) first.
<br>
<p>So I don't sound like I'm not helping (I am, remember that paper I 
<br>
just finished writing, not to mention my propagating of the 
<br>
Singularity meme), I'll take on the task of maintaining the to do 
<br>
list.  It'll just be a static HTML thing and you'll have to e-mail 
<br>
additions/errata/completions to me, but I'll keep it up.  So, aside 
<br>
from the following, what needs to go on here (send directly to me 
<br>
rather than the list, I'll post a copy of the first version back here 
<br>
when it's done)?
<br>
<p>* Code a Transhuman AI.
<br>
* Figure out how to program Friendliness into an AI.
<br>
* Write a Seed AI.
<br>
* Get funding!!!
<br>
* Write articles about Singularity related topics to make sure they 
<br>
are fully understood (for example, take some involved discussion on 
<br>
this list, sort out the conclusions, and write it up in a coherent 
<br>
manner).
<br>
* [Your items here].
