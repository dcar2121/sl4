<p>Not Friendly minds, at any rate, or any minds with the least concern for
<br>
human feelings.  It is possible to construct plausible scenarios in which
<br>
the world is a simulation of noninterventionist and utterly uncaring
<br>
superintelligences.  Trying to construct a scenario in which there is any
<br>
degree of interaction between us and the superintelligence runs into the
<br>
basic fact that this world does not look like there are any
<br>
superintelligences active in it.  If interacting with a hostile
<br>
superintelligence, I expect the world to look a lot worse; if interacting
<br>
with a benevolent superintelligence, I expect the world to look MUCH
<br>
better.  The fact that our world looks like it is being run strictly by
<br>
the laws of physics almost completely disconfirms the hypothesis that it
<br>
is being run by a benevolent interventionist superintelligence - the
<br>
Bayesian probability goes to almost zero.
<br>
<p>Rationalized religious theories often need to invent exotic scenarios in
<br>
which it's okay to split the Red Sea a few thousand years ago, but not to
<br>
save a cancer victim in the present day.  In other words, rationalized
<br>
religious theories naturally give rise to highly inconsistent and
<br>
inexplicable theories of when a superintelligence will intervene and why;
<br>
pain and death are &quot;natural tests&quot; in one instance, and horrors in
<br>
another; a miracle is an unacceptable giveaway of intervention today, but
<br>
was a great proof to the glory of God a few centuries ago.  Now
<br>
superintelligences may of course be inexplicable, but the problem is that
<br>
these inconsistencies are *not* inexplicable.  They have a very clear and
<br>
obvious pattern.  They are the result of trying to rationalize a religion
<br>
whose testified miracles are all memetically generated false stories about
<br>
past events.  In an Internet-connected world it's much harder to generate
<br>
false stories about current events, so the religion's account of the
<br>
present and the past will be inconsistent.  Similarly, if you have a world
<br>
entirely governed by the laws of physics, intelligent entities that evolve
<br>
will be stuck in a world that is painful and inconvenient until they fix
<br>
it, and until they fix it, their fuzzier thinkers will try to rationalize
<br>
it - given a certain cognitive architecture, anyway.
<br>
<p>Everything I see is consistent with a strictly-physics world full of
<br>
unnecessary pain - including the people trying to explain why it isn't
<br>
really unnecessary.
