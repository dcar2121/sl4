SPOILER REPLY:
<br>
<p>I liked the movie OK, but it didn't live up to my expectations (after 
<br>
reading Eliezer's nonspoiler and semispoiler review). I suppose if I had 
<br>
watched it having no idea it would involve sci-fi element, I would have 
<br>
been pleasantly surprised. Kind of like when uploading was mentioned on 
<br>
&quot;Friends&quot; (even though just to show Ross's nerdiness).
<br>
<p><em> &gt; If Alcor doesn't know about &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; forthcoming US version,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; **someone really ought to** tell them NOW
</em><br>
Hey now... :)
<br>
<p><p>I thought the movie would make more sense. Would anyone really sign up 
<br>
for the splicing option? Do they delete the whole chunk of memory 
<br>
between before you signed up and when you died which would normally be 
<br>
years? Didn't the guy in the bar give him enough of a clue, or at least 
<br>
enough of a temptation to try controlling things with his mind again? 
<br>
And of course, why, oh why did he have to jump from a building to wake up?
<br>
<p>The only reason you care about the &quot;hero&quot; is to the extent he gets 
<br>
tormented. You have to be a pretty unsympathetic character to be able to 
<br>
commit suicide *twice* and still not have the audience care that much. 
<br>
Hopefully, in the time he wakes up in, they'll be able to teach him that 
<br>
pumping bullets into some random person isn't a good way to act out your 
<br>
frustrations.
<br>
<p>I wonder, how he could have been a good guy and still have some of the 
<br>
same plot elements. How about he has a painful actual disease? Loving 
<br>
wife is tormented and financially burdened. One day he wakes up and they 
<br>
have found a miraculous cure and everything is great ... for a while. 
<br>
Then the nightmare begins. People are acting weird and eventually cruel 
<br>
and dangerous. Flashback reveals his wife signed him up for LE after 
<br>
finding out he would die soon. Unfortunately, she didn't have enough 
<br>
money to sign up for herself before she died (the sad version). People 
<br>
are turning nightmarish since they are in his imagination and have no 
<br>
mind of their own. LE can provide realistic virtual reality surroundings 
<br>
but the people are not conscious. He began to realize how people are not 
<br>
acting interesting and was subconsciously trying to force them to act 
<br>
interesting. Eventually, he is told what is going on and that the date 
<br>
is far in the future. He has to make tearful goodbye to all the other 
<br>
characters since none of them signed up. Hugs wife and then steps back. 
<br>
Lets go of her finger. Fade to white.
<br>
<p>Was there another movie where the character had to jump to death to go 
<br>
to another world? I have a very foggy memory of this. Construction 
<br>
worker falls off structure. Ends up in another world. Falls in love with 
<br>
a woman there, but then gets hit by a truck when riding on a bike. After 
<br>
that, he ends up back in original world and he jumps off building. 
<br>
Anyone know if I didn't dream this one?
<br>
<p>Now, &quot;The sixth sense&quot;, *that* was a GREAT &quot;character has big 
<br>
realization about splice in their existence&quot; movie!
<br>
<p>-Edwin
