So this clearly requires a much longer response than I'm willing to give right
<br>
now, but here's a few hopefully thought-provoking shots across the bow:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; myself to improve myself over time, it would violate what *I* think is

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable about the Universe.  I cannot sympathize with any entity that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; lousy reason.  Ve is not operating within any moral frame of reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that I recognize as valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why?
</em><br>
<p>It should be noted that my question is not actually to get a first-order answer,
<br>
but to discover if Eli knows why he thinks this...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But life is unpleasant, sometimes very unpleasant.  And life is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade, where you agree to experience some unpleasant things in exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the good parts.  That is simply a nitwit philosophical idea that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreamed up to rationalize away the discomfort from living with gratuitous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpleasantness that humanity was powerless to do anything about.
</em><br>
<p>Not defending or attacking that attitude, but:  &quot;humanity&quot; as such is powerless
<br>
to do anything at all, because it is an abstraction without any volition or
<br>
capacity to act in / of itself.  One must instead ask:  what can individuals do,
<br>
what are they responsible for / what are their obligations, and what kind of
<br>
framework yields the optimum benefit (max benefit for min cost for most
<br>
parties?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pain is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessary for growth, or to give life meaning, or to teach us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility, or any other nitwit philosophical reason.
</em><br>
<p>Not disputing this point of view, but:  prove it.  This is an extraordinary
<br>
claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  It's contrary to
<br>
most philosophical viewpoints, and someone who seeks to code what they believe
<br>
as a core philosophy into a compulsory &quot;operating system&quot; for the world should
<br>
be ready to defend said philosophy.  I do not disagree with you, but I want to
<br>
see your defense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructing a world from scratch it would not contain child abuse
</em><br>
<p>Again, not disputing you, but I suppose that depends on who you are, doesn't
<br>
it?  My point is not to defend or advance any particular position, but only to
<br>
point out the number of as-yet ungrounded and unexplained assumptions and
<br>
assertions, here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And similarly, the fun I have, regardless of how it measures up compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an &quot;average&quot; pre-Singularity life,
</em><br>
<p>You say &quot;regardless&quot; but --- interwoven throughout the argument, and previous
<br>
ones --- are assumptions about the Singularity.  As you have previously and
<br>
adamantly asserted the unknowability of post-Singularity existance, I find it
<br>
odd that you fall back on arguments which assumes positive (or negative)
<br>
qualitative differences between pre- and post-Singularity life.  I would say
<br>
&quot;check your premises&quot; but in this case I think first you should make them
<br>
explicit.  We may not even need or want to be individuals post-Singularity, so
<br>
your argument may be as sensible as pro- and eukaryotic cells arguing which form
<br>
is &quot;superior.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some of the unpleasantness in my life is due to choices I made willingly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I will not forgive any entity that turns out to be responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having made those choices necessary.
</em><br>
<p>So you are not responsible for everything that has ever happened to you?
<br>
Respectfully but gravely, this sounds like the symptoms of a dangerous memetic
<br>
infection called &quot;victimhood.&quot;  It is unfortunately epidemic in our society.
