<p>
I think my main objection to most of the proposals being batted around
<br>
here is that they seem to involve playing games with other people's
<br>
lives.  Some other entity decides what your destiny is, and then you're
<br>
shoved around like a piece on a chessboard until you fulfill it.  Is this
<br>
really what we want?  Is this really an appropriate way for the Universe
<br>
to work?  Is it the future we want to live in?
<br>
<p>If I found out that my life was a simulation, either for purposes of
<br>
remodeling the real Eliezer on Old Old Earth, or for purposes of forcing
<br>
myself to improve myself over time, it would violate what *I* think is
<br>
valuable about the Universe.  I cannot sympathize with any entity that
<br>
would choose to keep me locked up in a pre-Singularity world for such a
<br>
lousy reason.  Ve is not operating within any moral frame of reference
<br>
that I recognize as valid.
<br>
<p>Since I reject the idea that simple curiosity about ancestors is a just
<br>
reason for keeping me locked up in here, it follows that (in the event
<br>
this world is a simulation) either that isn't the reason for my existence,
<br>
or else it's a reason being employed by a nonFriendly controller... in
<br>
which case, why bother to imagine anything that innocuous?
<br>
<p>Because of that decision on my part, I can be sure that one of these three
<br>
conditions hold:
<br>
<p>1)  I am living in a genuine physical world;
<br>
2)  Unknown to me, my life serves a purpose I would recognize as important
<br>
enough to justify recreating the gratuitous unpleasantness of a
<br>
pre-Singularity world;
<br>
3)  I am living inside a non-Friendly SI, or a &quot;Friendly&quot; SI created by a
<br>
species operating in a different moral frame of reference - the root
<br>
process doesn't care what I think.
