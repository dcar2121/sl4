<p>I mentioned this a few months ago, but feel free to look back in the 
<br>
archives and see how I've gone from bad to good poster (IMO, of 
<br>
course).  I came in like your typical Extropian list kind of guy 
<br>
(despite the fact that I've only ever read the archives of that list 
<br>
and never subscribed to it) with some rationalized opinions that I 
<br>
knew were kind of fuzzy but were the best thing I had.  Well, over a 
<br>
couple of months the efforts of Eli and the list finally knocked that 
<br>
stuff out of me (okay, can't deny, I did a lot of the knocking out 
<br>
myself after they got me started).  I subscribed back at the start of 
<br>
December 2000.  The interesting thing is that I subscribed after I 
<br>
read the page about Shock Levels for the 4th time or something like 
<br>
that in trying to learn about this SL4 thing and finally decided I 
<br>
was ready to subscribe to the list.  I did about 4 months of research 
<br>
on my own before I ever joined the list, but this was just my path 
<br>
and I'm sure other people had their own paths here that were just as 
<br>
good, if not better.
