<p>&quot;Susan was bright enough to know that the phrase 'Someone ought to do
<br>
something' was not, by itself, a helpful one.  People who used it *never*
<br>
added the rider 'and that someone is me.'  But someone ought to do
<br>
something, and right now the whole pool of someones consisted of her, and
<br>
no one else.&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>There are certain mailing lists where there are endless proposals and
<br>
proposals and proposals and nothing ever gets done.  I don't want that to
<br>
happen on SL4.  I think the rule should be that you can't offer a proposal
<br>
for &quot;somebody to do something&quot; unless you're already doing something else
<br>
yourself, something which prevents you from taking on that additional
<br>
project you just proposed.  It doesn't have to be full-time, but there has
<br>
to be something, even if it's just writing a webpage.  But there has to be
<br>
something.
<br>
<p>What are you, yourself, doing to redouble your efforts toward the
<br>
Singularity?  What are your current efforts?  I have nothing against
<br>
spectators; it seems likely that most of the people who benefit from the
<br>
Singularity will hear about the Singularity after it happens, simply
<br>
because there is not enough time to grow to the size of the present
<br>
environmentalist movement or even the civil-rights movement of the
<br>
sixties.  I'll be happy if I'm proved mistaken, but I see nothing morally
<br>
wrong with living in a world where the majority of people win but don't
<br>
play.
<br>
<p>I don't even have a problem with spectators subscribing or posting to
<br>
SL4.  Some may be too young to have any disposable resources, or may be
<br>
too busy to have any disposable time, or, most likely at all, may have not
<br>
yet overcome that peculiar quirk of human nature that prevents people from
<br>
acting on the logical consequences of their ideals.  Pre-Singularity human
<br>
nature is a mess and I don't see how it would help for me to become
<br>
hostile to people who are just being human.  It takes time for beliefs to
<br>
soak in to the point that they become actions, and I don't want to disrupt
<br>
that process by rushing it.
<br>
<p>But I do think that spectators shouldn't post proposals for action unless
<br>
they are personally willing to contribute to them, or unless they're
<br>
already contributing what they can.  I apologize if it turns out that
<br>
you're already donating to one of the other transhumanist organizations
<br>
such as ExI/Foresight, or that you already have a major web complex of
<br>
Singularity writings, or if there's a reason I should have recognized your
<br>
name but didn't.  Still, are you volunteering to approach a prospect?  Are
<br>
you offering an introduction to a billionaire friend?  Are you posting a
<br>
PowerPoint presentation that you think would help?  Are you writing an
<br>
article for Forbes on ultraleveraged philanthropy?  Even if I know it's
<br>
human nature, it's still frustrating when someone says &quot;Hey!  Great idea! 
<br>
Full speed ahead!  I'm cheering you on!  Finish up that Singularity soon!&quot;
<br>
but won't do anything to actually help.  That sort of applause is only
<br>
encouraging when you hear it from someone who's too early in life to help
<br>
out now, but may be able to help out later - and even then such
<br>
encouragement should be sent in private, not in public.
<br>
<p>As for &quot;doubling all efforts&quot;, are you under the impression that we did
<br>
not previously think the Singularity to be important?  The urgency doesn't
<br>
get any higher.  It's already at max.  My life is devoted to the
<br>
Singularity and cannot be redevoted.  Doubled efforts require either
<br>
doubled funding or full-time volunteers.
<br>
<p>What's the point of writing &quot;someone ought to do X&quot; or &quot;the transhumanist
<br>
community ought to do X&quot; or &quot;Singularitarians ought to do X&quot;?  What good
<br>
does it do?  Which existing project should we halt to work on X?  The
<br>
people who have crossed over to doing something about it are not idle;
<br>
they are working on whatever it was that moved them to cross over.
<br>
<p>&quot;Someone ought to do X&quot; is not news.  &quot;I am doing X&quot; is news.  Let SL4 be
<br>
a refuge for the latter.
