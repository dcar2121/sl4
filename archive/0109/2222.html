I'll disobey my usual rule about not quoting complete messages, and even
<br>
the rule about not including the replied-to message afterwards, so that I
<br>
can note that this particular post is an example (though not the only
<br>
example) of a post that is acceptable on SL4.

<em>&gt; There are still plenty of religiously-minded individuals who avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally disregarding common sense and rational thought, clinging as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were to a few rocky isles that remain in a rapidly rising sea of general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge.  How?  There are a limited number of God concepts that, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to prove, are not completely discredited by the use of logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and scientific observation.  But these concepts have the fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weakness of being quite useless to humanity; They offer no answer to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question of &quot;how should a man live?&quot;, no method or even hope of invoking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divine intervention, and no explanations for anything that happens at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scales we can comprehend.  A couple of these concepts, by my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reckoning, are as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tinker God:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     --He created the universe in the sense that he was responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Big Bang, perhaps with some broad, unknown purpose in mind, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confines himself to passively observing the mess he made.  It could even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be an experiment of some kind.  This harks back to the &quot;Great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clockmaker&quot; idea dating back at least as far as the Renaissance, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be familiar to some readers of Arthur C. Clarke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pool-Shark God:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     --A variation on the above deity who also confines himself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passive observation, but can be said to have an active role because all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his actions were omnisciently planned for in his chosen method of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activating the Big Bang itself.  Like a skilled break at the start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a billiards game, by knowing exactly where every energy particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be and where it would be headed, he set initial conditions to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause every little thing to work out exactly the way he intended it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- whatever that was.  (This idea may well be weakened by the seemingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arbitrary randomness &quot;observed&quot; at the grainiest levels of reality yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; studied.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both of these god concepts do not reveal the purpose of creation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus fall short of providing any answers to recently evolved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligences in the far corner of just one of millions of galaxies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They do allow for some extension into intriguing other possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, such as Gods who reveal themselves, for good or ill, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to post-singularity superintelligences:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gardener God:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     --God as pragmatic tender of a universal garden.  No gardener would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fret about a single bacteria (humanity now?) living on the mite living
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the aphid living on the tomato plant, but might take the time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trim or weed that has grown out of control, or harvest the succulent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruit of a vine.  Whether the product of a human singularity would be so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant as a plant in the scale of the universe is unknowable -- but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be chilling to speculate on what the &quot;trimming&quot; would be like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should the result be more weed than fruit vine.  This concept provides a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible explanation for why we see no evidence of a Sysop or nano-tech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable civilization despite the mathematical probability that such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization has existed previously and would likely have left its mark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here already.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prime-Directive Star God:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     This is the beaten horse carcass that says greater intelligence does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist, has left its mark across our corner of the universe, but has its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own reasons for saving the introductions until a certain level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technological or mental savvy has been achieved and self-annihilation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoided.  The &quot;glad you could make it, join the club&quot; kind of god
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept.  This is another possible explanation for why we seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone in spite of all the odds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both these god concepts share the same Purpose Unknown weakness as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others above, but with the additional weakness of a seemingly perverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and deliberate disregard for individual suffering despite interest in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilizations at the superintelligence/galaxy-spanning level.  Such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god would not merely be incomprehensible, but reprehensible as well, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least to human ways of thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, in any case, it seems likely that either there is no god or that at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least no god will ever be shown to exist to pre-singularity humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity increases the possibility that some god would manifest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself -- perhaps it will be something of our own creation.  Therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (this a crude and pretentious jump of logic I'm making), those truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in finding and knowing God ought to be seriously interested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in fostering singularity.  Sure, it could mean that some cosmic pruning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scissors blast humanity back to the stone age or wipe it out entirely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but these bleak futures await us anyway if we never climb off this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global island, if singularity never occurs.  Why not take the only truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promising shot at something genuinely better?  The engineers of Babel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew what they were doing -- Moore's Law just hadn't furnished any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful hardware yet.
