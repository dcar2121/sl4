<p>This was intended to be a very general list, almost tongue-in-check

with my very broad items.  The real thing, while it will include 
<br>
broad goals, there will be of course more specific ones.  I was, in 
<br>
large part, asking for items in the hopes that folks who are more 
<br>
involved in this might be able to give me some more specifics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; * Get funding!!!

</em><br>
<em>&gt;forum set up
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think the other list *is* about this and more real world, practical stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; * Write articles about Singularity related topics to make sure they
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;This one truly makes me cringe. As much as I appreciate the in-depth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the papers being written, I am personally overwhelmed by it all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of feeling useless, and one could assume that most lurkers are too. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more of a presentation issue. Not enough pictures and diagrams, and too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;words.
</em><br>
<p>There are some diagrams deep inside CFAI.  And my paper has a table in it.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; * [Your items here].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Regarding writing articles about The Singularity, they seem to be oriented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;towards an elite SL4 group. How about introductory texts or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;summaries that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appeal to the other levels, all the way down to SL0? The purpose of writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about The Singularity is to increase understanding by all humans, not just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;SL4. Ideally, the more people at the SL4 level, the more resources we have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieving the rest of our goals towards the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>There are already folks doing this.  We need both Ben Franklins and 
<br>
Thomas Paines.
<br>
<p>(For those of you who don't understand this, read these quotes:
<br>
<p>&quot;Where freedom is, there is my home,&quot; said Benjamin Franklin.
<br>
<p>&quot;Where freedom is not, there is mine,&quot; responded Thomas Paine.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I guess this falls under the category of persuasion techniques and people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;management. Hold a competition, a sweepstakes, and most importantly, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;easy tasks that you can hook people in to the cause so that you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ask them to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contribute slightly more again next time. Don't ever expect anyone to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;create complex procedure&quot; and expect them to have it done 6 months later.
</em><br>
<p>Well, managing an open source project, this isn't quite the way it 
<br>
works.  Occasionally, someone comes along with some little fix they 
<br>
initiated on their own.  The rest of the time, in my experience, the 
<br>
project moves along by the focused efforts of a single developer.  In 
<br>
fact, I am probably the *only* person on the project who could 
<br>
complete most of the small tasks because the small tasks usually 
<br>
require lots of knowledge about the whole system (that is, if I have 
<br>
time).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm also curious as to what certain people's day jobs are, and how they manage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their time to balance work on the Singularity and the rest of &quot;real life&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I guess I fail to see how this would help anyone.  All of us manage 
<br>
our time in different ways; you have to figure out your own way to 
<br>
balance the Singularity with the rest of your life.
