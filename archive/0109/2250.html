</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not disputing this point of view, but:  prove it.  This is an extraordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.  It's contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most philosophical viewpoints, and someone who seeks to code what they believe

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; see your defense.
</em><br>
<p>Well, let's get the Friendliness misapprehension out of the way first; I
<br>
am not proposing to compulsorily prohibit all pain.  I am proposing that
<br>
pain must be voluntary, and that it should be prohibited (by direct
<br>
intervention) to cause involuntary, unconsented-to pain in other sentient
<br>
beings.  Under these local conditions, if most people come to agree with
<br>
the philosophical position that pain is unnecessary, then the emergent
<br>
result is that most pain will cease to exist.
<br>
<p>The requirement to defend the uselessness of pain results from the need to
<br>
argue with people who say:  &quot;The Singularity will give people the ability
<br>
to choose to eliminate pain, and people will make that choice even if it
<br>
is unwise, and pain is necessary; QED the Singularity is bad.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't have time to argue everything, so I'll confine myself to making
<br>
the following observations:
<br>
<p>1)  Given what we know about cognitive dissonance, and also about what
<br>
lousy philosophers humans tend to be, it is quite plausible that all the
<br>
philosophy dealing with the necessity of pain is total bull.  This
<br>
argument doesn't prove that it is bull, but it is sufficient to
<br>
demonstrate the invalidity of saying, or even pointing out as an argument
<br>
token, &quot;A lot of people believe it so there must be something to it.&quot;
<br>
<p>2)  Pain may sometimes play a causal role in a chain of events leading to
<br>
a positive result.  Furthermore, albeit more rarely, it may be impossible
<br>
to plausibly or easily substitute something else for the pain that would
<br>
have the same result.  I am thinking particularly here of some emotional
<br>
changes that seem to verge on pure neurochemistry.  However, if you're an
<br>
upload, you can replace any cognitive realizations that result from
<br>
biohuman-pain with improved intelligence and the ability to make the
<br>
realizations through pure abstract reasoning, and you can replace the
<br>
neurochemistry and hardwired emotional linkages by simple fiat.
<br>
<p>3)  Given (1) and (2), I assert that the ball is now in the other player's
<br>
court; they are required to give a specific example of a desirable
<br>
scenario involving pain, in which the need for the pain cannot be
<br>
eliminated by either improved intelligence or rewired emotions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constructing a world from scratch it would not contain child abuse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, not disputing you, but I suppose that depends on who you are, doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it?  My point is not to defend or advance any particular position, but only to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out the number of as-yet ungrounded and unexplained assumptions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assertions, here.
</em><br>
<p>The variable &quot;you&quot; may be taken to indicate &quot;most people&quot;, with additional
<br>
focusing for &quot;as rationality increases&quot;, &quot;as intelligence increases&quot;, and
<br>
&quot;philosophical systems that a human third party is likely to wish that I
<br>
should pay some attention to&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; And similarly, the fun I have, regardless of how it measures up compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to an &quot;average&quot; pre-Singularity life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You say &quot;regardless&quot; but --- interwoven throughout the argument, and previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones --- are assumptions about the Singularity.  As you have previously and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adamantly asserted the unknowability of post-Singularity existance, I find it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; odd that you fall back on arguments which assumes positive (or negative)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualitative differences between pre- and post-Singularity life.  I would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;check your premises&quot; but in this case I think first you should make them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicit.  We may not even need or want to be individuals post-Singularity, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your argument may be as sensible as pro- and eukaryotic cells arguing which form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;superior.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Unknowability is not the same as being unable to say &quot;better or worse&quot;. 
<br>
If we don't want to be individuals, and we aren't individuals, that's a
<br>
net improvement.  This holds for a lot of &quot;If we want X, and X ensues,
<br>
that's a net improvement&quot;.  X can be very widely variable, or even
<br>
completely unknown, and still allow a net conclusion of greater
<br>
desirability; not an absolute conclusion, of course, but still the more
<br>
likely conclusion compared to the negative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Some of the unpleasantness in my life is due to choices I made willingly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I will not forgive any entity that turns out to be responsible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; having made those choices necessary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you are not responsible for everything that has ever happened to you?
</em><br>
<p>No, I am responsible.  Remember, I think that this world is real,
<br>
nonsimulated, and physical.  This means that I am the most intelligent
<br>
entity in the system that produces my choices, and that my beliefs and
<br>
morals and other self-components operate naturally to produce my choices,
<br>
which means that I am &quot;responsible&quot; for my choices under the
<br>
common-to-virtually-everyone set of hardwired emotional processes that
<br>
assign the intuitive perception of moral responsibility.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Respectfully but gravely, this sounds like the symptoms of a dangerous memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infection called &quot;victimhood.&quot;  It is unfortunately epidemic in our society.
</em><br>
<p>Well, having called for precision, I will note the precision of your use
<br>
of the phrase &quot;sounds like&quot;.  I would dispute it, but I can hardly argue
<br>
with your patently true statement that it sounds to you like victimhood. 
<br>
I guess your perception of the emotional connotations of the phrasing I
<br>
used conflicts with my own perception, because to me &quot;Some of the
<br>
unpleasantness in my life is due to choices I made willingly&quot; does not
<br>
sound like a confession of victimhood.  I had thought the phrasing I used
<br>
was unambiguous - I take responsibility for my own choices, but if it
<br>
turns out that someone other entity is responsible for reducing my options
<br>
and for making unnecessary sacrifices falsely appear to be necessary, I
<br>
will be severely annoyed, and it seems very unlikely that entity's actions
<br>
could meet any moral standard I care to recognize.
