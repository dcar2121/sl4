<em>&gt; No matter how disgustingly sick this sounds, after spending a certain amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time in a hedonistic environment you WILL begin to desire pain.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't matter whether or not you can conceive this now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt any of us could go million subjective years before desiring a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-singularity simulation, let alone an infinity.  The sick truth is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't desire happiness; we desire sensory stimulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Besides, since you could consume an entire subjective human life in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of a second in post-singularity times, it wouldn't seem like much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a sacrifice.  We will/do desire variety and we will get it.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that the dichotomy between pleasure and pain is not a very
<br>
complex one.  An alternating sequence of pleasure and pain does not
<br>
display much more complexity than a pure tone of either type.  What you
<br>
want - assuming that you want to keep the basic human reinforcement
<br>
architecture in the first place - is continuing emotional involvement in a
<br>
scenario of ever-growing complexity, where the subjective intensity levels
<br>
vary quantitatively (at least) in a way linked to the complex decisions
<br>
and complex sensory information returned.  Pain is not necessary for this,
<br>
although pleasure does have to be complex and involved rather than simple
<br>
and dissociated.
<br>
<p>Of course, in saying this I am violating the post-Singularity
<br>
unknowability constraint.  The point I want to establish is that I can
<br>
think of at least one way to, starting from a basically human frame of
<br>
reference, construct a scenario for non-bored transhumans.  I'm not saying
<br>
that this is THE scenario, but I'm saying that it's possible to imagine a
<br>
scenario where there are better things to do than carve table legs for a
<br>
thousand years a la _Permutation City_.  To my mind this has always been
<br>
the single largest flaw in Greg Egan's works; in both _Permutation City_
<br>
and _Diaspora_, he doesn't seem to have been able to think of anything
<br>
interesting to do with a few thousand subjective years.  I don't think
<br>
you'd get bored even with the strictly human possibilities in a few
<br>
thousand years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On a related note, the odds that we are not in a simulation are impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to compute since we would have to assume the that we were in a simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, if we trust that our world is based on a backup of the future's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past, it doesn't take much time to figure the probability of a single human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life being in the &quot;real world.&quot;  Humans have been around for far under one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million years and we still have billions of years until our sun expires.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many many many more humans will exist beyond this point in history than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before it.  You chances of experiencing pre-singularity firsthand are slim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to none.
</em><br>
<p>Heh.  Fall off a cliff and... &quot;You thought you were one of the Eldest? 
<br>
Hah, not only that, you thought you worked for the Singularity Institute? 
<br>
Yeah, right!  Just who do you think you are, anyway?&quot;
<br>
<p>Note two things, however:
<br>
<p>1)  It doesn't solve the Fermi Paradox, since the ancestral simulation is
<br>
a simulation of an old galaxy that has not been colonized by aliens,
<br>
rather than being a simulation of a very young galaxy that was the first
<br>
to give rise to intelligent life - leaving us with the same Fermi Paradox
<br>
for the ancestral world being simulated;
<br>
2)  My own subjective experiences appear to violate the Friendly AI rules
<br>
that I would expect to be the outcome of the current scenario, if it is
<br>
historically accurate.  I mean, I can see complete failure of Friendliness
<br>
as a possibility, but find it hard to believe a partial failure that
<br>
allows nonconsensual ancestral simulations;
<br>
3)  There will be many many many more citizens in the future than there
<br>
are now, but not necessarily many many many more humans; the fraction that
<br>
choose to hang around the human intelligence level may very well approach
<br>
zero.  If there are simply Better Things To Do, only the fact that there
<br>
is an existing subpopulation of Luddites heading into the Singularity
<br>
makes it at all possible that there may be an unbroken line of Pedestrians
<br>
descended from Pedestrians ten million years into the future.  And would
<br>
those long-selected-for Pedestrians be running immersive delusive
<br>
ancestral simulations of SL4 list members?  How long would a Pedestrian
<br>
stay Pedestrian who engaged in that kind of hobby?
<br>
<p>However, the ancestral simulation argument is probably the only rational
<br>
reason to even speculate whether the life we see and inconveniences we
<br>
undergo have some kind of value or coherence which is not immediately
<br>
evident.
<br>

<p>The main one is quoting the whole post you replied to.  Would everyone
<br>
please just take the time to delete it?
