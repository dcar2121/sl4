<p>
It might be that one of the best ways to bring about the friendly AI is by
<br>
trying to be very rational about one's own actions, defining one's own goal
<br>
of life, and doing it in such a way that the resulting goal would be the
<br>
objective good; and consequently designing a resource management system to
<br>
automate and optimize one's own resource management decision making to
<br>
achieve personal prosperity, which is identical to the prosperity of
<br>
everyone.
<br>
<p>Resource management is what almost every company is doing, and larger
<br>
companies use sophisticated resource planning software for that. It is
<br>
entirely possible to apply machine learning algorithms to automate
<br>
increasingly many company decisions by analysis of data being collected in
<br>
such systems, and it seems likely that that some hi-tech companies are
<br>
already doing that, effectively creating AI-augmented corporations.
<br>
<p>However, corporations have been observed to conduct unethically, and not
<br>
benevolently, and there is no guarantee of responsibility, sentience and
<br>
friendliness of corporations in general. It is not entirely clear what
<br>
particular goals is a particular corporation's automated business decision
<br>
making systems are driven by.
<br>
<p>Recently, I had an opportunity to see how resource planning software can be
<br>
useful for a company's goal tracking, and to start working on my own system
<br>
to help me manage my own resources to succeed in life.
<br>
<p>It is a very interesting field of research, because it is possible to adapt
<br>
the newest machine learning algorithms to automatize one's own decision
<br>
making process.
<br>
<p>However, instead of secretly doing one's own personal system to achieve
<br>
personal goals, I think - for the sake of creating a friendly AI - it could
<br>
be much better to develop such a system in open-source fashion, with a goal
<br>
that's acceptable and desirable by all.
<br>
<p>I'd like to know, is anyone on this list is doing or thinking something
<br>
along these lines?
