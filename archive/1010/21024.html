From: Mindaugas Indriunas &lt;<a href="mailto:inyuki@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Friendly%20AI%20and%20Enterprise%20Resource%20Management">inyuki@gmail.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It might be that one of the best ways to bring about the friendly AI is by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying to be very rational about one's own actions, defining one's own goal of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life, and doing it in such a way that the resulting goal would be the objective 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;good; and consequently designing a resource management system to automate and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimize one's own resource management decision making to achieve personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prosperity, which is identical to the prosperity of everyone.
</em><br>
<p><p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;friendly&quot;. Eliezer's old definition 
<br>
( <a href="http://intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html">http://intelligence.org/upload/CEV.html</a> ) works as long as there are well defined 
<br>
boundaries between human and non-human, which will not be the case with AI. I 
<br>
prefer to define &quot;friendly&quot; as meeting the goals of humanity, with conflicts 
<br>
resolved as if by a secrecy-free ideal market. But my definition has the same 
<br>
criticism. We cannot agree now if embryos, animals, or foreign born humans count 
<br>
as &quot;humans&quot; with the same rights you have. It will be even harder when we have 
<br>
human-machine hybrids and uploads that can make millions of copies of 
<br>
themselves. That's important because markets are not fair. Without rules to take 
<br>
from the rich and give to the poor, the smart and the rich would get richer, 
<br>
leaving the others out to die. But that may not matter if our silicon 
<br>
descendants aren't programmed with the same sense of fairness that we are.
<br>
<p>I think that our inability to define &quot;friendly&quot; concisely is because it is 
<br>
algorithmically complex, on the same order as the sum knowledge of humanity. 
<br>
That's about 10^17 bits stored in human brains, assuming 10^9 bits per brain and 
<br>
assuming that 99% of what you know is known to at least one other person. Our 
<br>
legal system at all levels (from international treaties to local regulations) 
<br>
attempt to define what we mean by good behavior, but even that is obviously 
<br>
oversimplified and insufficient.
<br>
<p>In order for computers to do what you want, they have to know what you know, 
<br>
because effective human communication depends on both parties already knowing 
<br>
most of what the other knows. Humans can only communicate at a rate of a few 
<br>
bits per second. Getting all that knowledge into an AI will either take decades 
<br>
of observation of the global population or some advanced technology such as 
<br>
brain scanning to get the data quicker. Either way, AI should be friendly as 
<br>
long as we develop it with continuous feedback and its intelligence does not 
<br>
exceed that of humanity. (It has already surpassed individual humans). After it 
<br>
surpasses humanity, we will no longer control it, although it could make us 
<br>
think we do. We may or may not still be relevant, depending on whether you think 
<br>
&quot;we&quot; includes the machines that augment our intelligence by outsourcing our 
<br>
thinking.
<br>
<p>Sorry if the problem seems harder than you thought. It's not the first time the 
<br>
topic has come up.
