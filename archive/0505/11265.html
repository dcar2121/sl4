Jef:
<br>
I find it interesting to consider the parallels between aesthetic
<br>
appreciation and moral reasoning, each considered within a context of
<br>
greater awareness.
<br>
<p>primeradiant:
<br>
I think of a musical structure not as being governed by 'rules', but
<br>
rather as the emergent product of a specific 'grammar' and we have a sound
<br>
idea of what the emergence process is in classical music thanks to the
<br>
techniques of layer analysis. By 'grammar' I mean something closer to
<br>
Kauffman's 'autocatalytic set' - the elements, combinatorialities and
<br>
transformations inherent in diatonic, modal or 12-tone systems. In music
<br>
(IMHO) aesthetic appreciation derives from one's ability to perceive and
<br>
appreciate the interplay between deep and surface level unfoldings (I speak
<br>
of unfoldings since we are talking about the evolution of structure in
<br>
time). Musical memory is an essential part of this appreciation. The deep
<br>
structures are not consciously perceived during listening, but are directly
<br>
active subconscious awareness. IMHO one's level of moral reasoning is
<br>
directly proportional to one's level (or depth) of awareness of both
<br>
structure and function. It is also crucially dependent on the nature of the
<br>
grammar employed (this goes back to Plato of course).
<br>
<p>Jef:
<br>
Yes, this is very much what I was referring to, and I would add mention of another defining characteristic which is the recognition and appreciation of &quot;pattern integrity&quot; at all levels.
<br>
<p>- Jef
