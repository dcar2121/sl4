<p>
* Please read this if you want to participate, because I need you to
<br>
e-mail me ASAP. Details on this below.
<br>
<p>We've decided on the Mambo content management system. This is more
<br>
application than we need, considering the main functionality sought is
<br>
'discussion board/forum', but who knows – we might desire to increase
<br>
our collaboration using this system in the future, so it's nice to
<br>
have additional functional options available. And it's free, so no
<br>
downside regarding additional cost to install more-than-we-need.
<br>
<p>Once it is installed, we will be up and running.
<br>
<p>Predictably enough, the SIAI reading list
<br>
(<a href="http://www.intelligence.org/action/readinglist.html">http://www.intelligence.org/action/readinglist.html</a>) will form our
<br>
foundation for initial reading selections. But it won't do just to ask
<br>
each of you which item you'd like to study first; there are far too
<br>
many choices relative to the number of participants for us to get more
<br>
than one or two people to each group (unless the preference
<br>
distribution is skewed, which is possible, but not something on which
<br>
I'd like to rely.)
<br>
<p>So here's what I need from you:
<br>
1.	Go through the Reading List, selecting any materials you'd like to
<br>
read and discuss. Ordering them (by ordinal rank, weighting, or
<br>
otherwise) is welcome, and will be taken into account, but not
<br>
necessary. You can also specify at the subject area level if you'd
<br>
like to participate in any discussion in said area. E.g., &quot;cognitive
<br>
neuroscience; science fiction; Himalayan folk art.&quot;
<br>
2.	Please indicate whether you would be willing and able to act as a
<br>
moderator or discussion leader, and the areas (or readings) to which
<br>
this applies. People who are new to a particular topic can help each
<br>
other learn it, but having someone who has already processed it
<br>
available to offer guidance and answer questions would be even better.
<br>
3.	If you feel the SIAI Reading List is missing a resource you'd like
<br>
to discuss in the group setting, feel free to suggest it. I'll add
<br>
these to an online list for people to look over later on, and if
<br>
others agree with you, we can have a group accomodating your request.
<br>
4.	Any other comments you feel would be useful.
<br>
<p>With the study of these fields comes greater ability to achieve that
<br>
which is meaningful and significant (or, at least, a greater
<br>
likelihood of attaining said greater ability, which works out to the
<br>
same thing as far as rational action is concerned.) It's time to step
<br>
up the pace.
<br>
