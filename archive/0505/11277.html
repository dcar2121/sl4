<em>&gt; This design for Friendliness content is based on your decisions,

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously willing to assume the role of 'dictator of Earth' (Eliezer
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is, you are specifying basic rules that, if implemented by a RPOP,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not later be overridden under any circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I wasn't clear, then - I am _not_ proposing the RPOP take over
<br>
the world. I don't think that's likely to be possible, and if it were
<br>
possible it would be appallingly dangerous, not to mention ethically
<br>
dubious. I'm proposing once the RPOP exists, people decide what sort
<br>
of future they want, then give the RPOP the keys and tells it to go
<br>
implement humanity's decisions.
<br>
<p>At that point the RPOP could be called &quot;dictator of the universe&quot; in
<br>
terms of physical capability, but that would be highly misleading,
<br>
because it would imply independent volition. In my view the RPOP would
<br>
be just an operating system, not sentient or possessed of value
<br>
judgements, simply implementing the rules it was given at the start.
<br>
(I prefer the term &quot;operating system&quot; to &quot;sysop&quot;, to emphasize that I
<br>
don't think the RPOP will be sentient, nor understand sentience or
<br>
value.)
<br>
<p>(This differs from collective volition in that I think humanity's
<br>
_actual_ wishes will have to be used, not what the RPOP thinks they
<br>
would have been if we were wiser; hence, we need to decide up front to
<br>
exercise care and humility in what we do wish for.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is the suggestion to decide whether individual humans are capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making this choice based on their age an attempt to make your model more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptable to individuals used to current society?
</em><br>
<p>It is an acknowledgement that if I suggest a 13 year old who passes a
<br>
bunch of IQ and maturity tests be allowed to hop on a bus to the
<br>
Transcend by himself against his parents' wishes, the answer the law
<br>
will give to that is no, end of story. I don't make the law. Of course
<br>
if you think you can get it amended, by all means feel free to try!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So all people insisting that they want a domain exclusively for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves (and any other entities they create) would get one?
</em><br>
<p>To filter out most of the &quot;ooh, I want a galaxy for myself so I can
<br>
fill it with my obedient slave creations, muhahaha!&quot;s, I would suggest
<br>
the creation of a domain require an application by a group of a
<br>
certain minimum size, perhaps something like 100 people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are these limits always fixed at domain creation, are they always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject to later revision, is their later modifiability determined at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain creation, or use it completely different rules?
</em><br>
<p>Fixed at domain creation. (There could be some domains whose
<br>
proponents want to make their rules modifiable later, but there had
<br>
better be at least some fixed ones.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - If you're from the Transcend, for example, you're not going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allowed into the Amish domain anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does this apply to all sentiences that have ever had any kind of contact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a transhuman intelligence, even if they themselves are plain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'human' in capabilities and appearance? There are a lot of possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for memetic 'corruption', as perceived by the Amish, here. If the Sysop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explains this to them, it is quite possible that they will end up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocking all incoming data (including visitors) from the vast majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other domains.
</em><br>
<p>I think the Amish are likely to write such a rule for their domain,
<br>
and with good reason.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - Someone in a domain where lots of computing power is available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; individuals could simulate a bunch of sentient beings and not allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them access to the exit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a valid concern. There's also the possibility that physically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing individuals (or individuals existing on the lowest level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available in the domain) could be denied the possibility to use the exit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by other entities existing inside it; how exactly this would be possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depends on the implementation. If the exit is linked to spatial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coordinates, one could prevent access to them. If it required a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information one could eliminate the knowledge - etc.
</em><br>
<p>Indeed so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer's Collective Volition is an example for a Friendliness content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model that defers this kind of decision to an instance that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consist of plain humans. I don't know if it's actually workable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice; though if it isn't it should fail safely.
</em><br>
<p>Only if by &quot;fail safely&quot; you mean &quot;Eliezer will be wise enough to see
<br>
it's not a winner before go-live day&quot;. If actually implemented, I
<br>
think it is highly likely to fail in such a way as to eliminate all
<br>
sentient life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about the possibility of domains that use a significant part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available resources developing into &quot;hell worlds&quot; with a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative utility under most common value systems?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is possible that those domains would drag the total utility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (according to the mentioned value systems) of the entire system below zero.
</em><br>
<p>It is conceivable. I don't think it's going to happen (most people
<br>
don't want hell worlds, after all), though if you can come up with a
<br>
good way to prevent it, then by all means that could be added as a
<br>
metarule.
<br>
<p>(It wouldn't surprise me at all, mind you, if 99% of the universe ends
<br>
up, after the first billion years or so, in domains empty of sentient
<br>
life; that's still better than 100%.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The rules for individual domains? Get a bunch of intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsible humans who are representative of humanity's various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cultures and acceptable to the political process to draw them up. Use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Making that selection would be quite difficult by itself.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. The process I'd be inclined to suggest would be that any group
<br>
that meets a minimum number of individuals can specify the domain they
<br>
want to live in.
<br>
<p>I don't know whether political agreement will be possible, or whether
<br>
humanity is doomed to fight over the matter until it becomes too late
<br>
to do anything; but I think a proposal that goes as far as possible in
<br>
the direction of &quot;everyone gets what they want&quot; has the best chance of
<br>
avoiding that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Friendly AI for error checking (i.e. have it try to point out where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the humans' decisions would have unintended consequences, though the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; final decision has to be made by humans).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The conventional assumption would be to assume that even a RPOP couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predict all of the possible consequences in detail; after all you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably don't want to spend more resources (units of computation) for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial simulations than for the actual implementation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed; at the end of the day, it's going to have to come down to
<br>
human judgement.
