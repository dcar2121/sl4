<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>The purpose of this email is to announce the first public release of
<br>
AGI-SIM, an open-source 3D simulated world intended specifically to provide
<br>
a &quot;teaching playground&quot; for AI software programs.
<br>
<p>The conceptual motivation for AGI-SIM is the notion of &quot;experiential
<br>
interactive learning&quot; -- the idea that the easiest, though not necessarily
<br>
the only, way to create an intelligent software system is to make a
<br>
proto-intelligent software system and place it in a body (real or simulated)
<br>
and then interact with it.  In principle -- if the proto-intelligent system
<br>
is properly designed -- this allows perception, action, socialization,
<br>
language and cognition to be learned all in a bundle, as occurs with human
<br>
babies and children.
<br>
<p>While there are clear advantages to working with physical robots, at this
<br>
stage we feel there are more benefits and fewer costs to working with a
<br>
simulated environment and simulated embodied agents interacting therein.
<br>
For one thing, physical robotics is costly and time-consuming, and doesn't
<br>
lend itself well to a globally-distributed, low-cost team.  (Furthermore,
<br>
even when one does work with physical robots, one often finds that having a
<br>
simulation of one's robot and its environment is a good thing.)
<br>
<p>This AGI-SIM release, numbered 0.9, is far from perfect or complete, and we
<br>
haven't yet made a demo intended for showing to the &quot;general public.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, the project is now in a state where we feel it's worthwhile to
<br>
recruit other developers into the project.  Ergo, this email!
<br>
<p>There is a to-do list, and we believe that roughly 2-3 further (intensive)
<br>
man-months of effort will be required to bring AGI-SIM to the point where it
<br>
can
<br>
<p>a) be used routinely for teaching AI's
<br>
b) be used to make &quot;wizzy-looking&quot; demos of what AI's can do
<br>
<p>Of course, the todo list goes on longer than that, and there is a virtually
<br>
unlimited list of improvements that can be made.
<br>
<p>AGI-SIM is based on the CrystalSpace simulation engine --- it's a particular
<br>
customization of CrystalSpace for AI teaching/training purposes.
<br>
<p>General information about AGI-SIM can be viewed here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://agiri.org/agisim/">http://agiri.org/agisim/</a>
<br>
<p>The SourceForge page is here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/agisim/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/agisim/</a>
<br>
<p>and the documentation (which includes a to-do section) is here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=28104&amp;group_id=108786">http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=28104&amp;group_id=108786</a><br>
<p>At the moment, this is a Linux-based project, although a port to Windows
<br>
would not be impractical in future, since CrystalSpace has a Windows
<br>
version.
<br>
<p>Currently, most of the work to be done is only for fairly skilled Linux/C++
<br>
programmers, but we could also use someone to help with a less technical
<br>
task: creating nifty-looking wireframe models to serve as objects in the
<br>
AGI-SIM world.  CrystalSpace appears to use some not-that-common file
<br>
formats for wireframe models, but, they are simple, and it seems that
<br>
conversion out of other similar formats wouldn't be a big problem.
<br>
<p>If you're interested in helping out with AGI-SIM, please contact me (Ben
<br>
Goertzel, <a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=Re:%20AGI-SIM%200.9%20release;%20AGI-SIM%20developers%20sought">ben@goertzel.org</a>) or the lead AGI-SIM developer/designer, Ari
<br>
Heljakka (heljakka at iki.fi).  If you happen to be in New Zealand you
<br>
should probably contact Joel Pitt instead, who lives there and was the
<br>
initial developer on AGI-SIM, and is still an active participant (extropy at
<br>
users.sourceforge.net).  Ari was working close to full time on AGI-SIM for
<br>
the last few months; he is now shifting his priorities to helping with
<br>
Novamente AI design and implementation, but will still keep his hand in with
<br>
AGI-SIM.
<br>
<p>Finally, a note on fundraising.  AGIRI and Novamente LLC currently have
<br>
essentially zero funding for our general-intelligence work!  (Yes, we have
<br>
plans for remedying this situation, but these will take a while to execute,
<br>
and they involve among other things making wizzy demos of Novamente learning
<br>
using AGI-SIM.)  Novamente LLC has some small ongoing commercial projects,
<br>
but they are small enough that no excess $$ for research or AGI-oriented
<br>
development comes from them at the moment.   Ari's (quite ascetic) salary
<br>
for the first half of 2005 is being covered by a small investment in
<br>
Novamente LLC made toward the start of this year.
<br>
<p>So, if you want to support AGIRI, Novamente LLC or AGI-SIM, donations or
<br>
investments would be very much appreciated.  We are not yet set up for
<br>
PayPal, but if you're interested in donating to AGIRI or investing in
<br>
Novamente LLC, please contact me at <a href="mailto:ben@goertzel.org?Subject=Re:%20AGI-SIM%200.9%20release;%20AGI-SIM%20developers%20sought">ben@goertzel.org</a>
<br>
<p>I want to stress that, although our main motivation for making AGI-SIM is
<br>
Novamente, it is open-source and nothing about it is particularly
<br>
Novamente-specific.  We would like very much if participants in other AI/AGI
<br>
projects would contribute to AGI-SIM and utilize it for their own research.
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
Ben Goertzel
