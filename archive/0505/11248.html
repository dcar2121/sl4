<em>&gt; This thread is pure deliciousness to me, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had some variant of it running in the back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my head for months, trying to work out a plot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a sandboxed FAI as the central character. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find I disagree, Ben, and suspect that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyperrational being will find plenty to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicted about. Example: Arthur C. Clarke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explains in '2010' that HAL went mad because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conflict created by being the sole possessor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of secrets about the true mission of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Discovery.
</em><br>
<p>Well, HAL was far from hyperrational...
<br>
<p>I think that a hyperrational being will avoid &quot;deluding itself&quot; to any
<br>
significant extent.  This will eliminate most inner conflicts.
<br>
<p>Also, it will be able to rewire itself to avoid experiencing negative
<br>
emotions.  But without the spice of negative emotions, positive emotions
<br>
will also lose most of their appeal, IMO...
<br>
<p>My view is that emotions are mostly caused by the opacity of the hindbrain,
<br>
and secondarily by the opacity of parts of the forebrain to other parts of
<br>
the forebrain.  Since the parts of our brain are out of touch with each
<br>
other, they get &quot;big surprises&quot; from each other all the time, which are
<br>
coupled with physiological responses -- &quot;emotions&quot;....  There are particular
<br>
patterns to these &quot;big surprises&quot; and physiological responses, which are
<br>
familar to us all.  A hyperrational AI will &quot;surprise itself&quot; only in
<br>
surprising ways, not in predictable ways (due to the lack of internal
<br>
opacity).  So if a hyperrational AI does have emotions, they won't be
<br>
repetitive like ours -- it'll be a new emotion every time, algorithmically
<br>
irreducible to the previous ones ;-)
