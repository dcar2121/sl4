<em>&gt;Ah, the hubris of ignorance. So you are intimately

<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

<p><p>Pot.  Kettle.  Black.
<br>
<p>Let's face it, there are a number of people on SL4
<br>
with truly monsterous egos.
<br>
<p>Look, we're really all in the same boat.  No one has
<br>
any real answers, or they would have built the SAI by
<br>
now.  There are just varying degrees of educated
<br>
guess-work.
<br>
<p>Speaking of guesses, I might just use this post to
<br>
correct another of my earlier crap ideas that I had
<br>
posted to SL4.  
<br>
<p>When I was still at the brain-storming stage, I had
<br>
suggested that some new probability theory might
<br>
expand Eli's 4-level model of intelligence to 8
<br>
levels.  This was based on my early hunch that
<br>
Bayesian reasoning was insufficient for general
<br>
intelligence (due to the fact that deductive reasoning
<br>
reasoning does not appear to fit into Bayesian
<br>
induction).  
<br>
<p>I'm still more confident than ever that Bayes is
<br>
insufficient, but it didn't imply what I thought it
<br>
did.  Eli's 4-level model was correct as far as it
<br>
goes.  No more levels of intelligence needed along
<br>
that axis.  I had been confusing knowledge domains
<br>
with reasoning operations.  A simple enough mistake to
<br>
make.    
<br>
<p>In fact my new theory is that there are *two* axes of
<br>
intelligence.  One axis everyone knows about - the
<br>
axis from modalities, pattern recognition , through
<br>
concept formation, thoughts to action plans (Eli's 4
<br>
level model).  I'm sure that's right as far as it
<br>
goes.
<br>
<p>But my new idea is for a *second* axis of
<br>
intelligence, something totally over-looked by all
<br>
researchers so far.  This new axis is where my 7
<br>
'universal reasoning categories' (or knowledge
<br>
domains) are located.
<br>
<p>So my new hunch is for some new probability theory to
<br>
explode the model of intelligence sideways.  Taking
<br>
Eli's 4 level model of intelliegence and adding a new
<br>
axis of intelligence with my 7 universal knowledge
<br>
domains , explodes the complexity of the model and
<br>
would produce 4*7 = 28 fundamental categories of
<br>
thought.  The resulting schematic is what I posted on
<br>
the wiki:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sl4.org/wiki/MarcGeddes/UniversalDataTypes">http://www.sl4.org/wiki/MarcGeddes/UniversalDataTypes</a>
<br>
<p>Of course, this new theory of mine could be just as
<br>
crappy as the old one ;)
