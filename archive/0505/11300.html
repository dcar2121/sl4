<em>&gt; Reading into his sentences, he is saying that we are morally better off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treating people equally, even though they may be different in this
</em><br>
context.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To offer some defense of this position, even though none was reported,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one might presume that highlighting the differences between people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to unwarrented judgements about them, even though the differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be real. The argument is twofold: one is psychological, one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contextual.
</em><br>
<p>How does it help society to 'downplay' differences when the full truth is
<br>
required to have a fully informed opinion when making decisions?  Recently I
<br>
read in the paper that 50% of the Canadian Federal income tax payers paid
<br>
less than 5% of all the income tax collected.  We have a socialist party
<br>
(NDP) that insists on telling everyone that companies and wealthy people
<br>
aren't paying their fair share.  My point is that it is politically
<br>
incorrect to talk about the % contribution to our national coffers by the
<br>
lower half of our population, so people in general have no clue who is
<br>
paying the bill.
<br>
<p>The idea of treating people equally in whatever context, even though they
<br>
are obviously not equal, sounds exactly like the underlying principal behind
<br>
socialism.  Socialism has never worked in our world on a large scale because
<br>
it doesn't consider the fact that people's productivity is greatly
<br>
influenced by motivation.  If the differences are artificially lessened then
<br>
the incentive for the less productive is also lessened and people are less
<br>
likely to do any better.  Some pressure is required for people to do their
<br>
best, even if those same people would prefer not to experience the pressure.
<br>
<p>Very often I have read that women earn much less than what men do.  This
<br>
could be because women are discriminated against when it comes to their
<br>
salary or any number of other reasons.  Without public discourse on why
<br>
these differences occur, we can't know in any real way if the difference is
<br>
just or not.
<br>
<p>To look at history and say that differences have been badly used so we
<br>
shouldn't look at differences, is burying your head in the sand.  Although I
<br>
agree that discrimination has been unjust at times in the past, that doesn't
<br>
mean that all discrimination is bad.  Isn't it ok to discriminate against
<br>
brain surgeons that have only operated on frogs?  If you have 1 position and
<br>
10 people have applied then some discrimination must to used to select just
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>Businesses make budgets so that as their economic year progresses, they can
<br>
see the differences (plus/minus) between the year they have predicted
<br>
(budget) and reality as it happens.  The reason for this is to highlight the
<br>
differences and investigate and take action to remediate the consequences of
<br>
that difference.  Analyzing the differences is normally the best way to
<br>
identify problems and discover new information.  To avoid looking at
<br>
differences takes away one of the best learning tools humans have.
<br>
<p>There is no way to stop most people from coming to conclusions that are not
<br>
based on the facts and an accurate look at the differences.  Stupid people
<br>
will believe stupid things no matter that you hide the truth or not.  The
<br>
question is whether the truth and the differences will be discussed by all
<br>
the others or not.
