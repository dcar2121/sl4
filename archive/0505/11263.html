<p><em>&gt; Dear Matt,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     By 'serial' I meant, of course, 12-tone music, hence Schoenberg, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Berg Webern, Stravinsky (middle period, e.g. /Abraham and Isaac/), the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-war Europeans including Boulez, Berio, Dallapiccola, Lutoslawski, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Schaffer, Xenakis, earlier Stockhausen, the American School including 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course Milton Babbitt, Wuorinen, Lewin etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I introduce people to 12-tone music I usually select Schoenberg's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; /A Survivor from Warsaw/ -  a terrifying, gut-wrenching work! The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all-combinatorial sets that lie at the core of 12-tone composition are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related to Messiaen's /modes of limited transposition/ and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; symmetric modes employed by Bartok in his central string quartes (3-5).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12-tone composition has expired as a creative force. This is tragic. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It demands a highly developed level of skill, and most of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical advances made before its final demise never became fully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorporated into the serial 'canon'. Yet for me it always represented 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the power of transcendence of the human condition. By its very nature, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 12-tone structures and processes are excellently adapted to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer/AI encoding and expression (I did a lot of work on this at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the CSRG in Toronto during the 80's).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<p>Coincidentally, this week I read _October The First Is Too Late_ by Sir 
<br>
Fred Hoyle, 1966, because someone said it presented an interesting 
<br>
theory of time.  While I didn't find anything that struck me as 
<br>
interesting or informative about time, I did find this inspiring passage 
<br>
about a musical competition between an accomplished human composer and 
<br>
his opponent, posing as a god but actually a posthuman:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It still baffled me as to exactly what restrictions were being
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placed on the choice of the notes themselves. This was not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twelve-tone music, all the tones were not being used. Yet it wasn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tonal in the sense of our system of keys. The structure was more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complicated than anything I had heard before. I had the strong
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impression of rules depending somehow on the form of the work
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself. It was as if the rules, the restrictions, depended on the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place in the piece. The rules at the beginning and those at the end
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seemed different, and different again from those in the middle. It
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was as if the large-scale development of the work influenced its
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of construction.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention all this to show why it wasn't in any way easy even for a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trained musician to grasp instantly what was going on. Plainly I had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deal with a subtle and complex form. My last thought of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people outside was that they could hardly find the music of the god
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easier to comprehend than my own. I think it was at this point, as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second of my opponent's sections came to an end, that the first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chill of apprehension swept over me...
<br>
<p>I find it interesting to consider the parallels between aesthetic 
<br>
appreciation and moral reasoning, each considered within a context of 
<br>
greater awareness.
<br>
