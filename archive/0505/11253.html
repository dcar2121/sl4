<p>
Hello to all --
<br>
<p>It's been quite a while since I issued a serious &quot;call for programmers&quot; to
<br>
this list.
<br>
<p>So, here goes ;-)
<br>
<p>The purpose of this email is twofold: an update on the Novamente AI project
<br>
(see www.agiri.org, and <a href="http://www.goertzel.org/research.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/research.htm</a>) and a renewed
<br>
call for help.
<br>
<p>First the update: Progress on Novamente has been nonzero but frustratingly
<br>
slow.
<br>
<p>Cassio (my lead collaborator) and I have been spending a lot of time on
<br>
Biomind,
<br>
our bioinformatics startup (www.biomind.com), and have been doing lots of
<br>
great
<br>
stuff, but not so much AGI stuff as we would have liked.  We have also spent
<br>
some time
<br>
building a narrow-AI NLP system for a government customer here in
<br>
Washington, which may be very useful as a kind of interface to Novamente,
<br>
but again isn't really an AGI-approach to language processing...
<br>
<p>I've been gradually polishing the Novamente book manuscripts, and those are
<br>
actually nearing completion, miraculously enough....
<br>
<p>Izabela (my lovely new wife) and I did a lot of work fine-tuning
<br>
probabilistic
<br>
inference in Novamente; Luke Kaiser and Moshe Looks made a programming
<br>
language
<br>
(Sasha) that compiles into Novamente nodes and links; and Moshe integrated
<br>
procedure learning and pattern mining using the Bayesian Optimization
<br>
Algorithm
<br>
into Novamente....
<br>
<p>At this stage we have a lot of nice AI components integrated (or
<br>
semi-integrated ;p) with the NM core but still no f**king AGI, and we still
<br>
haven't made a serious effort to hook everything together in an AGI
<br>
context -- embarrassingly enough.
<br>
<p>However, things started moving in a more AGI-productive direction at the
<br>
start of 2005 when we got a small investment enabling us to bring Ari
<br>
Heljakka on board full-time to work on NM/AGI stuff.  Ari has been mostly
<br>
working on the AGI-SIM simulation world and has gotten it to a state where
<br>
it runs (though it's still quite incomplete) and can be worked on and
<br>
improved by others.
<br>
<p>It's become quite clear to me that we will NEVER get an AGI built at this
<br>
sort of rate -- doing AGI in our spare time while working on commercial
<br>
projects, and using part-time volunteers to help out now and then, just
<br>
isn't gonna cut it.  We need to raise some dedicated AGI funding.  And to do
<br>
that, we need to not only have me publish the NM books (finally) but to make
<br>
an at least moderately wizzy demo of NM doing something cool ....
<br>
<p>In this light, AGI-SIM is intended to serve a dual role: first to provide a
<br>
framework in which we can teach Novamente and in which it can potentially
<br>
interact with other AI systems, and second to provide a framework for
<br>
building a wizzy demo to show off Novamente to potential
<br>
investors/philanthropists...
<br>
<p>For information on AGI-SIM (an open-source project), see
<br>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/agisim/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/agisim/</a>
<br>
<p><a href="http://agiri.org/dev/SIM/">http://agiri.org/dev/SIM/</a>
<br>
<p>Our goal for 2005 is to create a wizzy demo of Novamente doing some simple
<br>
learning in the AGI-SIM world, and then take this demo to robotics firms and
<br>
try to get a co-development deal in which they fund us to
<br>
<p>1) simulate one of their robots in AGI-SIM
<br>
2) make Novamente successfully cognize in a simulation of one of their
<br>
robots
<br>
<p>the goal being of course to then actually make NM control one of their
<br>
robots (probably via Wifi not directly putting NM servers onboard).
<br>
<p>[To operate within AGI-SIM, NM will need some simple vision processing, but
<br>
it can be relatively low-bandwidth compared to human vision, so this won't
<br>
be a very big deal.]
<br>
<p>AGI-SIM is a Linux-only system at the moment but could be ported to VC++
<br>
pretty easily, as the underlying CrystalSpace graphics engine runs in C++.
<br>
It is still at a fairly primitive stage and needs a lot of work, I'm trying
<br>
to recruit volunteers for the project.
<br>
<p>Ari has recently shifted from AGI-SIM work to working on reimplementing
<br>
Probabilistic Term Logic inference in Novamente (the prior implementation
<br>
was too researchy and incomplete, now that we understand the theory
<br>
thoroughly we also understand how to make the implementation &quot;right&quot;).  He
<br>
will then have a lot of work to do on the Novamente side to get NM ready for
<br>
AGI-SIM learning/interaction.
<br>
<p>So one thing we could REALLY use right now would be a couple people to focus
<br>
attention on AGI-SIM itself.  This is not AI coding per se, it's server-side
<br>
C++ coding.  It's not mainly graphics coding per se either, because the
<br>
graphics is done in the CrystalSpace simulation engine.  But it's definitely
<br>
not *easy* coding, this demands pretty good C++ programmers.  At the moment,
<br>
just compiling AGI-SIM is a pain, due to the numerous dependencies on
<br>
various open-source packages...
<br>
<p>If you want to help out w/AGI-SIM (or Novamente, of course ... I'm just
<br>
suggesting AGI-SIM at the moment because it's a current &quot;pain point&quot; and
<br>
it's more approachable than NM-core coding ... plus it's open-source which
<br>
may be a bonus from the volunteer's perspective) please let me know.
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
Ben Goertzel
