<br>
<p><em>&gt;Anyway, I think you could change the impression your transhumanist books
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make on emotion-hungry readers simply by a change on the literary level:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find a way of describing characters feelings and thoughts and *pathways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personality development* which matches in beauty and ornateness the way you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describe &quot;the majesty and brutality of all the Tegmark levels was being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rehearsed in infinite miniature&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course, actually doing this in a way that doesn't seem hokey and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fits in well with the themes of your writing -- well that's easier said than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;done.
</em><br>
<p>Points well taken, Ben. To some extent this difference is intended, to some 
<br>
extent it also derives from my assumption that we know what it is to feel 
<br>
anger, we have feature detectors for emotions, whereas cosmological vistas 
<br>
and mathematical insights don't automatically push our buttons. But I admit 
<br>
readily that my attempts to press those default buttons tend to be 
<br>
schematic; I suppose the extreme case of such schematism is Larry Niven's 
<br>
writing. He almost always points the reader at an emotional reaction that 
<br>
his rhythms simply fail to evoke. So literary readers regard him as a 
<br>
barbarian pushing blank tokens around. I don't, because I understand what 
<br>
he is doing -- but I do wish he were better in the evocation department.
<br>
<p>Thanks for that.
