</em><br>
This design for Friendliness content is based on your decisions,
<br>
however. And in a lot of similar cases (the basic design, but also some
<br>
parameters; see your responses to my example questions) you are
<br>
obviously willing to assume the role of 'dictator of Earth' (Eliezer
<br>
called it 'taking over the world' in the CV document on the sl4-wiki) -
<br>
that is, you are specifying basic rules that, if implemented by a RPOP,
<br>
could not later be overridden under any circumstances.
<br>
Is the suggestion to decide whether individual humans are capable of
<br>
making this choice based on their age an attempt to make your model more
<br>
acceptable to individuals used to current society?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's something that needs to be decided; I offered merely a few suggestions.
</em><br>
Naturally; the question is who gets to decide it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;How are the available
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ressources divided between them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My suggestion would be: find out at the start who wants to live in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which domain, then whatever percentage of humanity picked a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain, it gets allocated that percentage of the available resources.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Should be plenty to go around, we're looking at galaxies per person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (plus descendents).)
</em><br>
So all people insisting that they want a domain exclusively for
<br>
themselves (and any other entities they create) would get one?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;How is interdomain communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;regulated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some would allow it, some wouldn't. (The Amish domain isn't going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want TV broadcasts from the Transcend, for example.)
</em><br>
Are these limits always fixed at domain creation, are they always
<br>
subject to later revision, is their later modifiability determined at
<br>
domain creation, or use it completely different rules?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Do 'sentient beings' only get to choose their domain once,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are they free to move between them at any time, or are parameters of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;individual domains responsible for deciding who is allowed to enter or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;leave?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The latter. I'd advocate giving every domain an exit that in principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone is allowed to use at any time, but in practice there are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be issues like:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - In the distant future, the domain you want to emigrate to may not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the resources left to take more immigrants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - If you're from the Transcend, for example, you're not going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed into the Amish domain anyway.
</em><br>
Does this apply to all sentiences that have ever had any kind of contact
<br>
with a transhuman intelligence, even if they themselves are plain
<br>
'human' in capabilities and appearance? There are a lot of possibilities
<br>
for memetic 'corruption', as perceived by the Amish, here. If the Sysop
<br>
explains this to them, it is quite possible that they will end up
<br>
blocking all incoming data (including visitors) from the vast majority
<br>
of other domains.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Someone in a domain where lots of computing power is available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals could simulate a bunch of sentient beings and not allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them access to the exit.
</em><br>
That's a valid concern. There's also the possibility that physically
<br>
existing individuals (or individuals existing on the lowest level
<br>
available in the domain) could be denied the possibility to use the exit
<br>
by other entities existing inside it; how exactly this would be possible
<br>
depends on the implementation. If the exit is linked to spatial
<br>
coordinates, one could prevent access to them. If it required a specific
<br>
information one could eliminate the knowledge - etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If you allow unupgraded humans to make final decisions about these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I allow...? Supposing I wanted to prevent them, how do you propose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I go about it, and who or what should make the decisions instead?
</em><br>
Eliezer's Collective Volition is an example for a Friendliness content
<br>
model that defers this kind of decision to an instance that doesn't
<br>
consist of plain humans. I don't know if it's actually workable in
<br>
practice; though if it isn't it should fail safely. Of course this only
<br>
means that it won't destroy the world directly - the setback dealt to
<br>
the project by pursuing an incorrect Friendliness content model may
<br>
still cause sufficient delays to allow a parallel development to destroy it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Catastrophic? There's no guaranteed way to avoid that, but I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain protection offers the best hope that it will be restricted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual domains rather than wiping out _all_ sentient life.
</em><br>
What about the possibility of domains that use a significant part of the
<br>
available resources developing into &quot;hell worlds&quot; with a significant
<br>
negative utility under most common value systems?
<br>
It is possible that those domains would drag the total utility
<br>
(according to the mentioned value systems) of the entire system below zero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Do you have a better method of determining these parameters?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The rules for individual domains? Get a bunch of intelligent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsible humans who are representative of humanity's various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures and acceptable to the political process to draw them up. Use
</em><br>
Making that selection would be quite difficult by itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Friendly AI for error checking (i.e. have it try to point out where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the humans' decisions would have unintended consequences, though the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; final decision has to be made by humans).
</em><br>
The conventional assumption would be to assume that even a RPOP couldn't
<br>
predict all of the possible consequences in detail; after all you
<br>
probably don't want to spend more resources (units of computation) for
<br>
initial simulations than for the actual implementation.
