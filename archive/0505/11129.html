<p>
<em>&gt; Part of why I made the post is to save others from re-inventing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a methodology that has already been demonstrated to work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably well on complicated projects.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that the formal methods approach to software engineering
<br>
has a lot to teach AGI designers, and indeed I have argued at
<br>
length for the SIAI to pay more attention to this field. However
<br>
AGI needs considerably more general techniques that can handle
<br>
the complex functionality involved. By necessity we're developing
<br>
these as we go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Part of the difficulty of AGI design is that it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; modularise easily into a set of cleanly seperated components
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with narrow interfaces and distinct functionality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a design can't be broken down into pieces that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable, designable and testable by humans, it's probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not going to work or do what you wanted it to.
</em><br>
<p>I agree completely, and I wish more AGI designers did. Note that
<br>
I said 'modularise easily /and/ cleanly'. You can have one or
<br>
the other, though 'easy' is relative; generated any correct and
<br>
useful functional decomposition of general intelligence is a hard
<br>
thing to do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another design breaks the brain down into some number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functional components (in the 10's or 100s) that are distinct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and separable in their inputs and outputs, and are each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionally simple enough to design.  Such a design would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely be brittle enough not to be able to change itself and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still function.
</em><br>
<p>This is true only for naive probabilistic self-modification
<br>
techniques, and even then with self-modelling and rollbacks it
<br>
just slows self-modification down to a crawl due to the low success
<br>
rate of trial-and-error. Advanced probabilistic techniques can
<br>
work around brittleness and the issue is nearly irrelevant for
<br>
deliberative self-modification. If an AGI design actually works, it
<br>
should always be able to refactor itself better than the programmers
<br>
can (of course for opaque designs this may not be saying much as
<br>
they are by definition nearly impossible for the programmers to
<br>
refactor once evolved/generated/self-organised/whatever).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you do a fuzzy hierarchical spaghetti/gordion knot design, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't see how a human would be able to design it in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place, or if you let it grow and evolve, how you would be able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to test it safely.
</em><br>
<p>Firsly, you certainly wouldn't catch me using anything 'fuzzy' or
<br>
'evolved'. Secondly, workable AGI does look like a Gordian knot,
<br>
though the minimum size of that knot is still highly debatable.
<br>
Yes, that makes designing (and explaining) AGI very hard. This
<br>
should be utterly non-surprising, unless you believe that the
<br>
sole reason AGI hasn't been cracked yet is inadequate computing
<br>
power.
