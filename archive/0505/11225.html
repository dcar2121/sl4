<br>
<p>is an interesting review of my new sf novel GODPLAYERS. The reviewer is 
<br>
especially exercised by the fact that my posthuman characters are not 
<br>
immediately understandable -- indeed, beyond empathy -- by human standards:
<br>
<p>&lt;the frustration level mounts as one waits in vain... for characters... to 
<br>
display any hint of a genuine inner life as they move randomly from scene 
<br>
to scene, world to world, reality to reality. Perhaps Vorpal homunculi do 
<br>
not possess inner lives, and Broderick's point is that these seeming 
<br>
superhumans, for all their power, are soulless automatons without a shred 
<br>
of humanity.... Surely there should be some character, somewhere in a 
<br>
novel, to which human readers can feel connected. ...As the sequence of 
<br>
events grows increasingly frenzied, with ever-greater reliance placed on 
<br>
what might be termed info-splatters, the lack of a deep humanistic 
<br>
substrate left this reader, at least, with no ground to stand on. &gt;
<br>
<p>I'm torn in my response to this. On the one hand, it wouldn't make much 
<br>
sense to write about posthumans as if they were representations of the 
<br>
people down the road, or in the next room. On the other, I have tried to 
<br>
ground the fairly breakneck narrative within thematic structures and 
<br>
reverberations recognizable from myth, dream, and the traditions of 
<br>
science-fiction itself when it ventures upon the superhuman. Greg Egan met 
<br>
with this same objection, of course, and so, in various degrees, did John 
<br>
C. Wright and Charlie Stross. Maybe it's an artistic problem beyond 
<br>
solution -- for humans.
