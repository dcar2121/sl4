<em>&gt; &gt;As a side comment, I also of course reject Marc
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Geddes' suggestion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Bayesian inference and deduction are unrelated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never suggested any such thing Ben.  *Of course*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian inference and deduction are related.  What I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was doubting was whether they could be *completely*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integreted.  Can deduction be completely integrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the Bayesian framework, or is there something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (however small) amiss?
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't really know what &quot;the Bayesian framework&quot; means....
<br>
<p>Logical deduction is simply the process of deriving conclusions from axioms
<br>
via repeated application of the axioms to each other....
<br>
<p>Thus, deductions can be made based on the axioms of probability theory (from
<br>
which Bayes theorem is one deduced conclusion), or based on the axioms of
<br>
probability theory appropriately combined with other axioms (such as the
<br>
axioms of predicate logic).
<br>
<p>The appropriate combination of predicate logic with probability theory is a
<br>
tricky issue, which we've approached in Novamente via taking a &quot;term logic&quot;
<br>
approach to reformulating predicate logic, which seems to simplify the
<br>
matching-up with probability theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Too many people seem to think that pattern recognition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and prediction making is sufficient for general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence.  It isn't.  General intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consists of a prediction system AND a goal system.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, but I'm not sure what it has to do with deduction.
<br>
<p>Clearly, the mind must (explicitly or implicitly) make inferences of the
<br>
form
<br>
<p>&quot;Action X in context C is likely to help me achieve goal G&quot;
<br>
<p>Such inferences may be made based on (explicit or implicit) deduction, and
<br>
also via probabilistic induction based on historical observations (which is
<br>
where Bayes rule comes in).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I keep pointing out that general intelligence consists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of *two* integrated systems:  a system for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *evaluating*/*formulating goals* and a system for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *making predictions*  Everyone seems to have focused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the latter and overlooked the former.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What effect will a complete solution for the goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system have on the solution for the prediction system?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Don't assume that these two systems are independent.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, these systems are independent.
<br>
<p>For instance, it is key that the system's initial supergoal(s) are
<br>
formulated in a way that is amenable to flexible goal-refinement by the
<br>
system's (implicit or explicit) reasoning systems.  Otherwise the goals will
<br>
be useless in actually guiding the system's behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The interaction between induction and deduction is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly the weak link in the Bayesian picture.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I'm not really sure what you mean by &quot;the Bayesian picture&quot;.  I'm not
<br>
sure what Eliezer means by &quot;the Bayesian way&quot; either, so my confusion on
<br>
this issue is not restricted to understanding *you* ;-)
