</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to be in order to work? (Frequently Asked)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;The ambiguous answer to that hardly explains much. But my objection was
<br>
a bit hasty and based on an imperfect recollection of your writings.
<br>
&nbsp;In rereading _Collective Volition_, I came across this bizarre claim
<br>
that appears to indicate the core of what you and I disagree about:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q7.  Where  is  the  collective  volition  getting this kind of power?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Frequently Asked)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A7.  A  Really  Powerful  Optimization  Process is not a god. A Really
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Powerful  Optimization  Process  could  tear apart a god like tinfoil.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If you expect the RPOP to become this powerful within a few years of
<br>
being started, then your prediction is so many orders of magnitude
<br>
away from what most intelligent people who have thought about that
<br>
kind of question expect that you shouldn't expect to be taken seriously
<br>
without a very carefully phrased argument. Yet it's hard to see any
<br>
argument that is serious enough to be worth responding to. Eric Baum
<br>
makes some moderately strong arguments in his book What is Thought?
<br>
against your claim. If your plans depend on a hard takeoff and your
<br>
reasons for expecting a hard takeoff are no better than the ones I've
<br>
run across, then I'm pretty certain you will fail.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What kind of goal system do you plan to have built into the RPOP while
<br>
it is computing CV? Presumably you see the risk that it will take over
<br>
the world before you get around to using any results from the CV
<br>
simulations. Yet I can't see any indication of how well you would be
<br>
able to handle this risk.
<br>
&nbsp;It would also be nice to know how the RPOP's goals will enable or prevent
<br>
it being used to deal with a nonfriendly AI should one be developed before
<br>
the CV simulation produces any results.
