Part of why I made the post is to save others from
<br>
re-inventing a methodology that has already been
<br>
demonstrated to work reasonably well on complicated
<br>
projects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Part of the difficulty of AGI design is that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't modularise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easily into a set of cleanly seperated components
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with narrow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfaces and distinct functionality.
</em><br>
<p>If a design can't be broken down into pieces that
<br>
are understandable, designable and testable by humans,
<br>
it's probably not going to work or do what you wanted
<br>
it to.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(a scheme
<br>
<em>&gt; used by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain), which improves the chance of an educated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guesswork design
</em><br>
<p>The brain is made up of a whole lot of relatively
<br>
simple components.  The functional divisions which
<br>
we have assigned to the cortex are our arbitrary
<br>
boundaries, just like we have assigned color
<br>
boundaries to what is really a continuous spectrum.
<br>
<p>An understandable design modeled on the brain would
<br>
have components that act sufficiently like neurons
<br>
that you train like you do humans.  Such a design
<br>
would be sufficiently opaque to itself that it
<br>
wouldn't have a fast runaway.
<br>
<p>Another design breaks the brain down into some
<br>
number of functional components (in the 10's or
<br>
100s) that are distinct and separable in their
<br>
inputs and outputs, and are each functionally
<br>
simple enough to design.  Such a design would
<br>
likely be brittle enough not to be able to 
<br>
change itself and still function.
<br>
<p>If you do a fuzzy hierarchical spaghetti/gordion
<br>
knot design, I don't see how a human would be
<br>
able to design it in the first place, or if you
<br>
let it grow and evolve, how you would be able
<br>
to test it safely.
