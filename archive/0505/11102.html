<em>&gt; PINKER: Regarding bias: as I mentioned at the outset, I don't doubt that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bias exists. But the idea that the bias started out from some arbitrary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coin flip at the dawn of time and that gender differences have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetuated ever since by the existence of that bias is extremely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely. In so many cases, as Eagly and the Stereotype-Accuracy people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out, the biases are accurate. Also, there's an irony in these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion of bias. When we test people in the cognitive psychology lab, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we don't call these base rates &quot;gender,&quot; we applaud people when they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apply them. If people apply the statistics of a group to an individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, we call it rational Bayesian reasoning, and congratulate ourselves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for getting them to overcome the cognitive illusion of base rate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neglect. But when people do the same thing in the case of gender, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treat Bayesian reasoning as a cognitive flaw and base-rate neglect as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational! Now I agree that applying base rates for gender in evaluating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual men and women is a moral flaw; I don't think that base rates 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ought to be applied in judging individuals in most cases of public 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision-making. But the fact that the statistics of a gender are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applied does not mean that their origin was arbitrary; it could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistically sound in some cases.
</em><br>
<p>Not all Bayesian evidence is legal evidence.  The police chief may know 
<br>
perfectly well who is the boss of organized crime in his city, yet be unable 
<br>
to prove it in court.  Yet if the police chief confided in me who the crime 
<br>
boss was, I would be likely to believe him - because we live in a society 
<br>
where the police chief *cannot* have people jailed just on the basis of his 
<br>
accusation or mine.  We have chosen to exclude certain kinds of valid Bayesian 
<br>
evidence from our legal system because of the temptation they would present to 
<br>
individuals for forgery, if the evidence were accounted legal evidence.
<br>
<p>Similarly, some kinds of Bayesian evidence are not scientific evidence.  In 
<br>
fact, scientific evidence is a small subset of Bayesian evidence.  Watching 
<br>
something happen a single time is Bayesian evidence - not so strong an 
<br>
evidence as a repeatable controlled trial, but not zero evidence either.  But 
<br>
we choose not to account anecdotal evidence as science, because science is the 
<br>
knowledge of humankind, accessible to humankind and replicable by other 
<br>
scientists.  I look down at my feet and observe that I am wearing black socks, 
<br>
and you probably believe me when I say it, but this rationally knowable fact 
<br>
is not yet part of Science.
<br>
<p>Similarly, we choose not to account certain kinds of base-rate statistics as 
<br>
*reputational* evidence.  The purpose of tracking a reputation is to encourage 
<br>
people to accumulate good reputations.  Therefore a person's reputation should 
<br>
not be evaluated from fixed qualities, beyond their ability to choose; this 
<br>
sends the wrong message.  But this doesn't mean you have to ignore all 
<br>
relevant base rates that may de facto correlate with race, gender, or other 
<br>
un-chosen attributes.  No one is forced to wear a baseball cap turned 
<br>
backwards, so assigning reputational weight to the clothes people wear is 
<br>
quite a different matter from judging them by the color of their skin.  The 
<br>
point is that reputational evidence should depend on personal choice or 
<br>
witnessed performance, just as legal evidence may not depend on hearsay, and 
<br>
scientific evidence may not depend on anecdotes.
