<p>
The problem with writing fiction about posthumans, as some of you have
<br>
mentioned already, lies in creating empathy. Any story driven by characters
<br>
that don't evoke empathy must fail. If I don't care about the main character
<br>
in the story, preferably as soon as possible, I will remain inert to
<br>
writer's even most sincere, and otherwise effective, attempts to make me
<br>
feel positive or negative emotions. I'll remain emotionally neutral because
<br>
I didn't care about the character in the first place.
<br>
<p>A consumer of story forms an empathetic bond with a character only when he
<br>
recognizes in the character his own humanity. At that moment the reader
<br>
begins to identify with that character and starts to live vicariously
<br>
through the character. If the bond of empathy is strong enough, we will
<br>
laugh and cry with the character. If that bond is too weak, the novel goes
<br>
back on the shelf.
<br>
<p>Stories about posthumans usually don't work because these posthuman
<br>
characters do not (or shouldn't) share much of our humanity, and by that I
<br>
mean our fallibility, and this is why the audience struggles to form an
<br>
empathetic bond with these characters. On the other hand, making a posthuman 
<br>
act like a
<br>
human doesn't make sense, just like portraying a human character acting like
<br>
a bacteria wouldn't (Ok, they both eat and move, but that's about all they
<br>
have in common). All this means that writing credible and moving stories
<br>
about posthumans is futile. Fortunately, there should be plenty of space 
<br>
*around* the problem. :)
