I suppose the trick is finding a balance between making the characters
<br>
too human (it would not be believable) and too posthuman (no reader
<br>
would understand).
<br>
I think Egan does this well (Diaspora and Schild's Ladder), Wright
<br>
less (especially Phaeton is really a 19th century person).
<br>
I look forward to reading your book, is it available as ebook?

<em>&gt; is an interesting review of my new sf novel GODPLAYERS. The reviewer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially exercised by the fact that my posthuman characters are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately understandable -- indeed, beyond empathy -- by human standards:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;the frustration level mounts as one waits in vain... for characters... to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; display any hint of a genuine inner life as they move randomly from scene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to scene, world to world, reality to reality. Perhaps Vorpal homunculi do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not possess inner lives, and Broderick's point is that these seeming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhumans, for all their power, are soulless automatons without a shred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humanity.... Surely there should be some character, somewhere in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel, to which human readers can feel connected. ...As the sequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events grows increasingly frenzied, with ever-greater reliance placed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what might be termed info-splatters, the lack of a deep humanistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate left this reader, at least, with no ground to stand on. &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm torn in my response to this. On the one hand, it wouldn't make much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to write about posthumans as if they were representations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people down the road, or in the next room. On the other, I have tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground the fairly breakneck narrative within thematic structures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverberations recognizable from myth, dream, and the traditions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science-fiction itself when it ventures upon the superhuman. Greg Egan met
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this same objection, of course, and so, in various degrees, did John
</em><br>
<em>&gt; C. Wright and Charlie Stross. Maybe it's an artistic problem beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution -- for humans.
