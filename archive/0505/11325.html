<p>Heh.  You're a funny guy j rogers.  The truth is I'm
<br>
not worried about anyone stealing the ideas, because
<br>
no one here (on SL4) has the faintest prospect of ever
<br>
implementing a real AGI within the Bayesian framework.
<br>
&nbsp;I'm sorry to inform you AGI wannabes that the world
<br>
is quite safe from your puny efforts.  
<br>
<p>Let's see what one of the world's leading philosophers
<br>
of science has to say about Bayesian reasoning shall
<br>
we?  This is a 'domain expert' so to speak, so let's
<br>
have a listen.
<br>
<p>Quote by philosopher of science Peter Godfrey-Smith:
<br>
<p>&quot;I think there is a more basic problem with the
<br>
arguments about convergence or the 'washing out' of
<br>
prior probabilities.  The convergence proofs assume
<br>
that when two people start with very different priors,
<br>
they nonetheless agree about all their *likelihoods*
<br>
(probabilities of the form P(e1/h), etc.).  That is
<br>
needed for disagreement about the priors to &quot;wash
<br>
out&quot;.  But why should we expect this agreement about
<br>
likihoods?  Why should two people who disagree
<br>
massively on many things have the same likelihoods for
<br>
all possible evidence?  Why don't their disagreements
<br>
affect their views on the *relevance* of possible
<br>
observations?  This agreement *might* be present, but
<br>
there is no general reason why it should be.  (This is
<br>
another aspect of the problem of holism.) 
<br>
Presentations of Bayesianism often use simple examples
<br>
involving gambling games or sampling processes, in
<br>
which it seems that there will be agreement about
<br>
likelihoods even when people have different priors. 
<br>
But these cases are not typical.&quot;
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&quot;Although Bayesianism is the most popular approach to
<br>
solving these problems today, I am not in the Bayesian
<br>
camp.  Some parts of Bayesianism are undeniably
<br>
powerful, but I would cautiously put my money on some
<br>
different ideas...&quot;
