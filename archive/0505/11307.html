<em>&gt;While messing about with evolved NNs is by no means safe, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is one of the AGI approaches least likely to produce a hard takeoff, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in any case I doubt this lot are going to do anything radically novel or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effective with them. As such I wouldn't place this anywhere near the top
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the list of things to be concerned about.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for the prompt response. I agree with you totally that this
<br>
particular project probably does not have what it will take to achieve
<br>
general cognition; however, I believe that any project in which cognition is
<br>
a possible outcome should be monitored at the very least (probably all that
<br>
is necessary in this case) and approached should it appear that progress is
<br>
being made. Unfortunately I don't know how to tell, from the outside of a
<br>
project, when or if progress is made. As Mr. Yudkowsky frequently points
<br>
out, the time to go from the &quot;We have succesfully simulated a human brain in
<br>
a computing substrate.&quot; announcement to &quot;Oh My God, Singularity!!&quot; is
<br>
possibly vanishingly small. I have done some searching of the SL4 archives
<br>
and did not immediately find a policy suggestion for dealing with non-SIAI
<br>
AGI projects. There is some mention on the SIAI website of loaning out
<br>
programmers to consult and signing non-disclosure agreements, but,
<br>
regardless of how weak an attempt this turns out to be, if someone starts on
<br>
the path to AGI without taking friendliness into account, is there an
<br>
intervention process in place?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Are you involved with the UK transhumanist/Extropian crowd?
</em><br>
<p>No. I am from Cincinnati, OH in the states, I just happened to run across
<br>
the story while perusing tech news.
