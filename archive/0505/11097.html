That's a possible outcome, but assuming that ensuring the infinitely
<br>
continued existence of sentience is even physically possible (our
<br>
universe may or may not allow for an infinite amount of computation to
<br>
be carried out) I'd guess (yes, that is unfortunately what I'm doing
<br>
here; I'd like to use math, but the empirical data about these cases is
<br>
rather limited) that a CV that doesn't clearly and explicitely fail
<br>
would have a better chance at making it work than unupgraded humans
<br>
realizing a Domain Protection scheme; more correctly, I consider the
<br>
expected utility in the first case to be higher.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;or it doesn't, in which case I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have any particular reason to care if it is optimized away.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
No; I don't personally care if everything a technically valid CV of
<br>
humanity decides to be not worth being preserved is destroyed. I'm in no
<br>
position to determine whether 'sentience' matters; I don't even really
<br>
understand what it is. If the CV decided that it doesn't matter (not
<br>
that I consider that especially likely), and the last judge agreed, I'd
<br>
accept these decisions as most likely right.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;The conventional assumption in this case is that unupgraded humans, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;with some predictive help from a RPOP, are not capable of reliably
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;forever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conventional assumption? What convention would this be?
</em><br>
The one of assuming the worst reasonably likely possibility. To quote
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://homepage.eircom.net/~russell12/dp.html">http://homepage.eircom.net/~russell12/dp.html</a>&gt;: &quot;We don't really know
<br>
what we're doing - we're fallible human beings, we don't have the gift
<br>
of precognition.&quot; - Indeed we are, and the assumption that leads to safe
<br>
failures in this case is that our cognitive deficiences are sufficient
<br>
to prevent us from reliably making good decisions (we may still make
<br>
them by accident, though the probability for that happening in any
<br>
individual case isn't exactly great) about rules supposed to stay valid
<br>
indefinitely. Making any other assumption about our current abilities
<br>
creates the possibility for an unsafe failure on this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;This applies to the rules for individual domains, but it also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;applies to the whole idea of domain protection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you have a better idea, it's not too late.
</em><br>
About rules supposed to stay valid indefinitely? Heck, no - I'm just an
<br>
ordinary human being, whatever I come up with would likely lead to
<br>
catastrophic results in the long term.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; If there are critical differences in the values of different subsets of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the population the CV still has the option implement an individual or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; domain protection system with permanently fixed rules; it would be in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; much better position to make that decision than present-day humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On what basis do you claim that?
</em><br>
<p>Quoted from &lt;<a href="http://sl4.org/wiki/CollectiveVolition">http://sl4.org/wiki/CollectiveVolition</a>&gt;:
<br>
&quot;In poetic terms, our collective volition is our wish if we knew more,
<br>
thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up
<br>
farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than
<br>
diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as
<br>
we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.
<br>
...
<br>
I arbitrarily declare the poetic term &quot;think faster&quot; to also cover
<br>
thinking smarter, generalizing to straightforward transforms of existing
<br>
cognitive processes to use more computing power, more neurons, et cetera.&quot;
<br>
<p>This specifies general enhancements to the cognitive abilities of
<br>
humans, an increase in their knowledge about reality, and an iterated
<br>
improvement of whatever other attributes the extrapolated humans would
<br>
like to have improved.
<br>
According to widely available empirical data, both better cognitive
<br>
abilities and available knowledge lead to better decisions. A transhuman
<br>
can more effectively and efficiently manipulate reality than a being
<br>
with human-level intelligence. A human expert (i.e. a human with more
<br>
knowledge) on a specific subject will usually outperform a novice of
<br>
similar general intelligence - there are examples of negative
<br>
correlation between knowledge and effective ability, but those are
<br>
caused by fixable bugs in the human cognitive architecture.
<br>
<p>Generalizing from a lot of real evidence, I'd expect the output from a
<br>
(working) CV process to be significantly better than that of any group
<br>
of unupgraded humans. If Domain Protection is the implementation with
<br>
the highest expected utility, a CV implementation will either fail
<br>
safely (assuming the friendliness architecture works, as has been
<br>
mentioned) or decide on implementing Domain Protection.
