Greetings SL4,
<br>
<p>I have finally broken my lurker status to mention a project which I just
<br>
finished reading about. Apparently the University of Wales is attempting,
<br>
along with 5 other universities, to construct a robot that thinks like a
<br>
human. While this is not necessarily alarming in and of itself, the amount
<br>
of funding being thrown at the project (1.9 Million Pounds to date)
<br>
potentially buys a LOT of computer power and definitely attracts attention.
<br>
The article, which is light on details, possibly because they don't exist
<br>
yet, can be found here:
<br>
<a href="http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_objectid%3D15467574&amp;met">http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_objectid%3D15467574&amp;met</a><br>
hod%3Dfull&amp;siteid%3D50082&amp;headline%3Drobot-name_page.html
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_objectid%3D15467574&amp;me">http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0200wales/tm_objectid%3D15467574&amp;me</a><br>
thod%3Dfull&amp;siteid%3D50082&amp;headline%3Drobot-name_page.html&gt; 
<br>
<p>The article seems to imply that the project aims for general cognition,
<br>
though possibly not human level cognition, and would appear to be more of
<br>
Evolutionary Psychology exercise than an attempt at a true AI. However; as
<br>
we all know, it doesn't take a purposely built AI to bring about the
<br>
singularity, and as computing power increases, the odds of stumbling across
<br>
general cognition increase.
<br>
At minimum I think that projects like this need to be watched, and, if
<br>
deemed that they have a chance of success, possibly an &quot;Envoy of
<br>
Friendliness&quot; could be sent to encourage them not to haphazardly unleash
<br>
such things upon the world without considering what would happen if it could
<br>
self improve beyond the level which they (the programmers) had intended.
<br>
<p>That having been said, this is a join post, so I should probably tell
<br>
whomever cares something about myself. My name is Ian Stuart, I am a
<br>
mechanical engineer by trade, futurist, firm SL3, trying to find a way not
<br>
to still feel awe at the SL4 techs, avid reader, previously of fiction, but
<br>
these days non-fiction is more interesting, and firm believer in the
<br>
principles of the SIAI, also I want to live forever, so get used to seeing
<br>
me around.
