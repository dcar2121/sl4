<em>&gt; intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>*shrug* If I were dictator of Earth, I wouldn't make biological age
<br>
the sole metric. I'm not, and the fact is that biological age has been
<br>
made the critical metric for most things, including when you're
<br>
allowed leave your parents. Don't blame me, wasn't my decision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What domains with what rules are actually created?
</em><br>
<p>That's something that needs to be decided; I offered merely a few suggestions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How are the available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ressources divided between them?
</em><br>
<p>My suggestion would be: find out at the start who wants to live in
<br>
which domain, then whatever percentage of humanity picked a particular
<br>
domain, it gets allocated that percentage of the available resources.
<br>
(Should be plenty to go around, we're looking at galaxies per person
<br>
(plus descendents).)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How is interdomain communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regulated?
</em><br>
<p>Some would allow it, some wouldn't. (The Amish domain isn't going to
<br>
want TV broadcasts from the Transcend, for example.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do 'sentient beings' only get to choose their domain once,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are they free to move between them at any time, or are parameters of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual domains responsible for deciding who is allowed to enter or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave?
</em><br>
<p>The latter. I'd advocate giving every domain an exit that in principle
<br>
anyone is allowed to use at any time, but in practice there are going
<br>
to be issues like:
<br>
<p>- In the distant future, the domain you want to emigrate to may not
<br>
have the resources left to take more immigrants.
<br>
- If you're from the Transcend, for example, you're not going to be
<br>
allowed into the Amish domain anyway.
<br>
- Someone in a domain where lots of computing power is available to
<br>
individuals could simulate a bunch of sentient beings and not allow
<br>
them access to the exit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you allow unupgraded humans to make final decisions about these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters
</em><br>
<p>If I allow...? Supposing I wanted to prevent them, how do you propose
<br>
I go about it, and who or what should make the decisions instead?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; suboptimal to catastrophic results are likely.
</em><br>
<p>Suboptimal, sure. That's a good sign; trying for optimality in human
<br>
affairs never works, if domain protection relied on such that would
<br>
strongly contraindicate using it.
<br>
<p>Catastrophic? There's no guaranteed way to avoid that, but I think
<br>
domain protection offers the best hope that it will be restricted to
<br>
individual domains rather than wiping out _all_ sentient life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Keeping all of these settings adjustable into the indefinite future, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other hand, would provide possibilities for attacking individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domains.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's why they have to be nailed down forever, pretty early on,
<br>
otherwise the whole purpose is defeated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you have a better method of determining these parameters?
</em><br>
<p>The rules for individual domains? Get a bunch of intelligent,
<br>
responsible humans who are representative of humanity's various
<br>
cultures and acceptable to the political process to draw them up. Use
<br>
Friendly AI for error checking (i.e. have it try to point out where
<br>
the humans' decisions would have unintended consequences, though the
<br>
final decision has to be made by humans).
<br>
