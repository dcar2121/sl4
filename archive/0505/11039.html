Ben -
<br>
<p>Thanks for a wonderful post illuminating the importance of subjective 
<br>
context in relation to values and human appreciation. 
<br>
<p>I think this question of art effectiveness (now there's a rare concept) 
<br>
really comes down to knowing your audience and playing to their 
<br>
intrinsic responses.  Unfortunately--for many of us to one side of the 
<br>
bell curve--this means keeping the work firmly rooted in the center and 
<br>
extending only far enough to get some oohs and aahs but not so far that 
<br>
most of the audience is lost.  There's a strong analogy here to the 
<br>
question of effectively communicating transhumanist memes to the general 
<br>
population...or communicating SL4+ memes to the transhumanist population!
<br>
<p>Personally, I prefer to read only fiction with the potential to make me 
<br>
laugh out loud from my brain being tickled by formation of strange and 
<br>
deep new connections.  Greg Egan's works are at the top of my list, but 
<br>
it's been a while.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One thing that would be interesting to see in a sci-fi novel would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;character who the reader DOES intensely care about, because he/she has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed in a loving and careful manner characteristic of high-quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;traditional literature, who THEN becomes transhuman, rational,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emotionally-detached and MORE INTERESTING but yet LESS EMOTIONALLY GRIPPING
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the reader.  This would solve the artistic problem you mention, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense, and it would have a powerful impact on the reader in terms of making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the aesthetic difficulties I've been discussing explicit as part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;story's theme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
As discussed earlier,  &quot;MORE INTERESTING&quot; and &quot;LESS EMOTIONALLY 
<br>
GRIPPING&quot; are in fundamental conflict with each other in relation to the 
<br>
mass audience.    One way to pull it off, however, might be as follows:  
<br>
(1) Develop individual character for strong reader-attachment based on 
<br>
human instinctual values, (2) develop the rational, emotionally-detached 
<br>
phase in the context of solving many of the current worries of life, and 
<br>
(3) develop the idea of this rational character, and others like him, as 
<br>
part of a larger culture doing wonderfully amazing and glorious things 
<br>
(to appeal to humans innate desire to be part of something greater than 
<br>
themselves.)
<br>
<p>- Jef
