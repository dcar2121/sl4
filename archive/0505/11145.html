<p>Er, quite aside from what value we may give the amount of 'work'
<br>
evolution went through designing a mind, it seems patently absurd to
<br>
imagine that even a corrected figure would have much to do with the
<br>
difficulty of designing something.
<br>
<p>Design is not axiomatic computation. It is not required that you
<br>
compute the phase space that contains the machine that you wish to
<br>
build, nor that you even have a model that entirely contains all the
<br>
relevant complexity. It only requires that your theory narrows the
<br>
design space to the point where you can be sufficiently lucky to do it
<br>
right. Better theories, and luckier people may change this value
<br>
significantly.
<br>
<p>If this is a nervous kind of line of reasoning for some people, I
<br>
think that's a good thing. It's important to recognize that most
<br>
'designs' are not actually for exact, specified things, they are
<br>
classes of possible things.
<br>
<p>Of course, better designs are smaller spaces, and so finding optimal
<br>
designs is computationally expensive, depending on how lucky you are
<br>
to begin with, and what value you're using for optimal, and your
<br>
generation process, and a host of other things that makes it difficult
<br>
to estimate.
<br>
<p>Baum's number is interesting, if bizarre. a quick ride on IDLE shows
<br>
that you would have to run a human-level computer (10^17(Moravec))
<br>
about 317097919837years to do it. Our computers today, are of course
<br>
not even worth talking about. I suppose we'd better start thinking
<br>
early, and put as many people on the job as possible.
