Okay list,
<br>
<p>I wasn't sure whether to just send this back to David, or to copy the 
<br>
list. It has moved off sl4 core topics to being, well, a critique of an 
<br>
argument about moral equality. I have sent it to the list in case 
<br>
David's view is representative of the majority, or indeed merely some 
<br>
others. I'm happy to take it offline, or just stop, at any time. List 
<br>
mod, feel welcome to contact me about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Reading into his sentences, he is saying that we are morally better off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;treating people equally, even though they may be different in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;To offer some defense of this position, even though none was reported,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;one might presume that highlighting the differences between people can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;lead to unwarrented judgements about them, even though the differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;might be real. The argument is twofold: one is psychological, one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;contextual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How does it help society to 'downplay' differences when the full truth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required to have a fully informed opinion when making decisions?  Recently I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;read in the paper that 50% of the Canadian Federal income tax payers paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less than 5% of all the income tax collected.  We have a socialist party
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(NDP) that insists on telling everyone that companies and wealthy people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aren't paying their fair share.  My point is that it is politically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;incorrect to talk about the % contribution to our national coffers by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lower half of our population, so people in general have no clue who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paying the bill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There are three kinds of lies: Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics.
<br>
<p>If you can't see that society doesn't make decisions that are either 
<br>
fully informed or based off the full truth, then you will indeed fail to 
<br>
see why it's important to downplay differences. Society is the mob, it 
<br>
is pop culture and informally made decisions. It's important, because 
<br>
the majority is powerful. Ignore the outside world at your peril - they 
<br>
won't go away just because you can't see them.
<br>
<p>For example, which 50%? The top, or the bottom in terms of income? Is it 
<br>
pointing out that the richest 50% aren't paying their fair share, or it 
<br>
is pointing out that the contribution of the poorest 50% isn't worth 
<br>
much of the total?
<br>
<p>Is the socialist party referring to their conception of &quot;fair&quot;, or yours?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The idea of treating people equally in whatever context, even though they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are obviously not equal, sounds exactly like the underlying principal behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialism.  Socialism has never worked in our world on a large scale because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it doesn't consider the fact that people's productivity is greatly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;influenced by motivation.  If the differences are artificially lessened then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the incentive for the less productive is also lessened and people are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely to do any better.  Some pressure is required for people to do their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best, even if those same people would prefer not to experience the pressure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You clearly have an agenda here. Nobody that I saw was suggesting that 
<br>
people be treated equally regardless of context, nor is that what the 
<br>
underlying principle behind socialism is, nor does your claim about 
<br>
about differences and incentives follow from any reasoned position, it's 
<br>
just a claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Very often I have read that women earn much less than what men do.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could be because women are discriminated against when it comes to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;salary or any number of other reasons.  Without public discourse on why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these differences occur, we can't know in any real way if the difference is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Such public discourse does occur. Would you like examples?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;To look at history and say that differences have been badly used so we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shouldn't look at differences, is burying your head in the sand.  Although I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agree that discrimination has been unjust at times in the past, that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean that all discrimination is bad.  Isn't it ok to discriminate against
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brain surgeons that have only operated on frogs?  If you have 1 position and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;10 people have applied then some discrimination must to used to select just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I don't follow your argument here. It *looks* like it make sense, but on 
<br>
further analysis, it doesn't.
<br>
<p>Your claim about what I am saying : That differences generally have been 
<br>
so badly used that we should never take notice of them.
<br>
This is neither what I said, nor what I meant.
<br>
<p>Your example : Isn't it okay to discriminate against brain surgeons that 
<br>
have only operated on frogs?
<br>
Answer: Yes, but only because we also have the knowledge that frogs are 
<br>
not like humans, and that we assume being a good brain surgeon requires 
<br>
practical experience. If we were wrong about those things, we would 
<br>
*also* be wrong to discriminate against brain surgeons that have only 
<br>
operated on frogs. You are making an argument against something that is 
<br>
not my position. My position is that difference are only worth taking 
<br>
into consideration if we *understand their context* and you are ignoring 
<br>
that aspect of my argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Businesses make budgets so that as their economic year progresses, they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;see the differences (plus/minus) between the year they have predicted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(budget) and reality as it happens.  The reason for this is to highlight the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences and investigate and take action to remediate the consequences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that difference.  Analyzing the differences is normally the best way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;identify problems and discover new information.  To avoid looking at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differences takes away one of the best learning tools humans have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is very true. They are operating on the &quot;where there's smoke 
<br>
there's fire&quot; principle. But, as you say, the undertake a process of 
<br>
analysis to identify problems and discover new information. They do not 
<br>
naively accept the smoke as a necessary fact, but look further into its 
<br>
cause: fire. Accepting gender difference as being a necessary difference 
<br>
is to accept smoke as an inevitable reality. If you look at my original 
<br>
argument, you will see that I said:
<br>
<p>&quot;Contextual: Such biases are often self-fulfilling prophecies. 
<br>
Concluding that gender bias is genuinely *caused by* gender, as opposed 
<br>
to being an incredibly complex issue, is a mistake. For example, a man 
<br>
who exhibits male biases may be a genuinely biased person, but this may 
<br>
not be a necessary bias. Bayesian reasoning proceeding on the evidence 
<br>
of the bias alone, will fail to capture the truth of that. As such, 
<br>
there are some kinds are evidence which are bad to include in your 
<br>
decision-making if you don't have a proper understanding of them.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no way to stop most people from coming to conclusions that are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;based on the facts and an accurate look at the differences.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Of course not. Individuals have free will. But you can influence it easily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Stupid people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will believe stupid things no matter that you hide the truth or not.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question is whether the truth and the differences will be discussed by all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the others or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Now you're just absolving yourself of responsibility. Stupid people 
<br>
don't always believe stupid things, and I.Q. is no guarantee of a 
<br>
sensible position. Largely, stupidity is responsible for many things, 
<br>
but other psychological factors are responsible for many more.
<br>
<p>Claiming this is just a way of saying &quot;well, it's not *my* fault that 
<br>
they emphasise the difference&quot;. That may come as cold comfort when the 
<br>
revolution comes, so to speak. One has to play both roles - critic of 
<br>
truth, but also pop psychologist. Ignoring the mode of existence of most 
<br>
people is just a retreat from the problem, not an answer.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
