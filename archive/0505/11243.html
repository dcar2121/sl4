Paul,
<br>
where can we hear serial composition?

</em><br>
<em>&gt; After my last contact with this List I'd been discouraged from making any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more contributions but just be content to watch things unfold. However, I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driven to write again in response to Damien's post and Ben's comments. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most concerns expressed by this particular thread are analysed in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail in Stanislaw Lem's Microworlds. In his own stories and novels, Lem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has focussed on human relations with 'aliens' - my own favourites being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solaris and His Master's Voice (although he comes to the 'human' level with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Cyberiad). The problems Lem identifies in Microworlds come to the fore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when we try to envisage posthumans, not to mention any future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superintelligent AI, whether friendly or not (would you classify the Solaris
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity as 'friendly'?). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Human beings are driven by evolutionary presciptives and the affective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; residue of primary and inflicted trauma. As such it is impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comprehend, let alone empathise with, a being that has transcended these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints (which a post human surely will have done). We cannot have our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cake and eat it. Those of us who do choose to transcend these constraints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have to bid farewell to &quot;life, love, laughter, tears, joy, sorrow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warmth, frienship, sex, naughtiness etc.&quot;, in other words &quot;all that makes us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truly human&quot; - at least in the sense that we currently understand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience these things. Whether they will weep or exult in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformation will be their own affair (as I've written before). Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology will be very different. How do you deal with writing about them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lem is pessimistic.I think Egan experienced this problem - he was unable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach the depth of Yatima's character and had to fall back on Orlando as our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'human interpreter'. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The music questions you've raised are also very interesting. I'm also a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; musician and composer and personally find some mid to late 20th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; music very emotionally powerful. Our aural system (and therefore music
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology) is structured around the perception of harmony. Schenkerian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis suggests the reasons why music of the 'classical' period is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotionally involving - see Structural Hearing by Felix Salzer. I did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Schenkerian analysis for many years (my teacher was a pupil of Salzer's, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in turn was a pupil of Schenker's) and have lectured and written about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depth-psychological dimensions of this mode of analysis. The emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impact of more 'abstract' music depends on the way materials are used - for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, strong emotive power can be created in serial ('12-tone') music by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the judicious exploitation of the extraordinarily rich harmonic potential of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the all-combinatorial hexachords. In this way I've often followed Berg in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating a true 'serial' (12-tone) infrastructure on a harmonic substrate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a considerable expansion of the technique, involving the use of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dyads, triads, tetrachords, pentads and hexachords embedded within all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transformations of the basic set. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd always felt that serial composition was the nearest we ever got to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman art form. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best wishes to all, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
