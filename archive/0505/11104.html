<p><em>&gt;&gt; PINKER: Regarding bias: as I mentioned at the outset, I don't doubt

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; extremely unlikely. In so many cases, as Eagly and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Stereotype-Accuracy people point out, the biases are accurate. Also, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; there's an irony in these discussion of bias. When we test people in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the cognitive psychology lab, and we don't call these base rates 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;gender,&quot; we applaud people when they apply them. If people apply the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; statistics of a group to an individual case, we call it rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Bayesian reasoning, and congratulate ourselves for getting them to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; overcome the cognitive illusion of base rate neglect. But when people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do the same thing in the case of gender, we treat Bayesian reasoning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; as a cognitive flaw and base-rate neglect as rational! Now I agree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that applying base rates for gender in evaluating individual men and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; women is a moral flaw; I don't think that base rates ought to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; applied in judging individuals in most cases of public 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; decision-making. But the fact that the statistics of a gender are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; applied does not mean that their origin was arbitrary; it could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; statistically sound in some cases.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not all Bayesian evidence is legal evidence.  The police chief may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know perfectly well who is the boss of organized crime in his city, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet be unable to prove it in court.  Yet if the police chief confided 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in me who the crime boss was, I would be likely to believe him - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we live in a society where the police chief *cannot* have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people jailed just on the basis of his accusation or mine.  We have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chosen to exclude certain kinds of valid Bayesian evidence from our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal system because of the temptation they would present to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals for forgery, if the evidence were accounted legal evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, some kinds of Bayesian evidence are not scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence.  In fact, scientific evidence is a small subset of Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence.  Watching something happen a single time is Bayesian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence - not so strong an evidence as a repeatable controlled trial, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not zero evidence either.  But we choose not to account anecdotal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence as science, because science is the knowledge of humankind, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accessible to humankind and replicable by other scientists.  I look 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down at my feet and observe that I am wearing black socks, and you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably believe me when I say it, but this rationally knowable fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not yet part of Science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, we choose not to account certain kinds of base-rate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics as *reputational* evidence.  The purpose of tracking a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reputation is to encourage people to accumulate good reputations.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore a person's reputation should not be evaluated from fixed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities, beyond their ability to choose; this sends the wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message.  But this doesn't mean you have to ignore all relevant base 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rates that may de facto correlate with race, gender, or other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-chosen attributes.  No one is forced to wear a baseball cap turned 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backwards, so assigning reputational weight to the clothes people wear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is quite a different matter from judging them by the color of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skin.  The point is that reputational evidence should depend on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal choice or witnessed performance, just as legal evidence may 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not depend on hearsay, and scientific evidence may not depend on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anecdotes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Pinker's argument was not Eliezer's argument, nor was it an irrational 
<br>
or wrong argument.
<br>
<p>Pinker's argument was an &quot;as-if&quot; argument, from a moral authority. His 
<br>
claim was, in philosophical terms, that even though we know some gender 
<br>
biases to be statistically accurate, we are better off behaving &quot;as if&quot; 
<br>
there were no bias.
<br>
<p>Reading into his sentences, he is saying that we are morally better off 
<br>
treating people equally, even though they may be different in this context.
<br>
<p>To offer some defense of this position, even though none was reported, 
<br>
one might presume that highlighting the differences between people can 
<br>
lead to unwarrented judgements about them, even though the differences 
<br>
might be real. The argument is twofold: one is psychological, one is 
<br>
contextual.
<br>
<p>Psychological: If we highlight differences between people, it will 
<br>
probably lead us into treating them badly, because people tend to clump 
<br>
into tribes. Non-bayesians and &quot;stupid bayesians&quot; will draw unwarrented 
<br>
conclusions. Historically, people have not reacted well to difference. 
<br>
Evidence for the downside of emphasising people's differences is plentiful.
<br>
<p>Contextual: Such biases are often self-fulfilling prophecies. Concluding 
<br>
that gender bias is genuinely *caused by* gender, as opposed to being an 
<br>
incredibly complex issue, is a mistake. For example, a man who exhibits 
<br>
male biases may be a genuinely biased person, but this may not be a 
<br>
necessary bias. Bayesian reasoning proceeding on the evidence of the 
<br>
bias alone, will fail to capture the truth of that. As such, there are 
<br>
some kinds are evidence which are bad to include in your decision-making 
<br>
if you don't have a proper understanding of them.
<br>
<p>If I were to take issue with anything said by Pinker, it would be this 
<br>
sentence: &quot;But the idea that the bias started out from some arbitrary 
<br>
coin flip at the dawn of time and that gender differences have been 
<br>
perpetuated ever since by the existence of that bias is extremely unlikely.&quot;
<br>
<p>What is *very* likely is that the bias started out from mutually 
<br>
beneficial evolution, in which men assumed a dominant position in 
<br>
relation to women as a result of their hunter-gatherer lifestyle. It is 
<br>
entirely likely that this balance has been perpetuated ever since on its 
<br>
own basis. One only has to look back to, for example, Ancient Greece to 
<br>
see how civilisational structures can propagate purely by accident of 
<br>
history. It is not drawing a long bow to see many correlations, and I 
<br>
would argue reasonable to infer a causal relation also. That's 2,500 odd 
<br>
years of historically propagated convention, and I have no reason to 
<br>
believe that convention is a powerful and dominant form of cultural 
<br>
learning.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
