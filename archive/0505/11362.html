<em>&gt;As a side comment, I also of course reject Marc
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Geddes' suggestion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesian inference and deduction are unrelated. 
</em><br>
<p>I never suggested any such thing Ben.  *Of course*
<br>
Bayesian inference and deduction are related.  What I
<br>
was doubting was whether they could be *completely*
<br>
integreted.  Can deduction be completely integrated
<br>
into the Bayesian framework, or is there something
<br>
(however small) amiss?
<br>
<p>Honestly, I sometimes think I'm dealing with people 
<br>
who are all mildly autistic or have aspergers when
<br>
talking to software engineer types (not referring to
<br>
you Ben, only to some others on this list).
<br>
<p>Too many people seem to think that pattern recognition
<br>
and prediction making is sufficient for general
<br>
intelligence.  It isn't.  General intelligence
<br>
consists of a prediction system AND a goal system. 
<br>
For sure pattern recognition/prediction  are of course
<br>
a major *part* of general intelligence and the
<br>
Bayesian framework is *part* of the solution, but are
<br>
they *sufficient* for general intelligence?
<br>
<p>I keep pointing out that general intelligence consists
<br>
of *two* integrated systems:  a system for
<br>
*evaluating*/*formulating goals* and a system for
<br>
*making predictions*  Everyone seems to have focused
<br>
on the latter and overlooked the former.  
<br>
<p>What effect will a complete solution for the goal
<br>
system have on the solution for the prediction system?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't assume that these two systems are independent.
<br>
<p>The interaction between induction and deduction is
<br>
clearly the weak link in the Bayesian picture.
