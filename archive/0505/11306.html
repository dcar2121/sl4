<em>&gt; Apparently the University of Wales is attempting, along with 5 other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universities, to construct a robot that thinks like a human.
</em><br>
<p>The computer science department at the university of Wales seem to focus
<br>
their research on an assortment of narrow AI areas. My guess would be
<br>
that they've decided to band together for fundraising purposes; a big
<br>
crossdisciplinary, multi-site effort probably sounds great for the
<br>
purpose of getting a fat grant out of the research council. However
<br>
AFAIK they don't have anyone with a grand plan for building an AGI,
<br>
not even a vauge framework such as EPIC. From my experience of university
<br>
politics, an AI project involving tens of research groups spread over six
<br>
sites is simply going to mean additional money for pet projects plus a
<br>
few gala luncheons and some superficial nods towards integration to keep
<br>
the PR people happy (the Japanese '5th generation' project was somewhat
<br>
like this on a much larger scale). In the event that they do take this
<br>
seriously, I'd guess based on the publication lists of the departments
<br>
involved that they'll try evolved neural networks; it may not be a
<br>
coincidence that the physical design sounds a lot like Edelman's 'Darwin
<br>
III' robot. While messing about with evolved NNs is by no means safe, it
<br>
is one of the AGI approaches least likely to produce a hard takeoff, and
<br>
in any case I doubt this lot are going to do anything radically novel or
<br>
effective with them. As such I wouldn't place this anywhere near the top
<br>
of the list of things to be concerned about.
