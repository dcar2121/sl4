<p>
I had proposed that there are 7 different 'modes' of
<br>
knowing, or 7 different 'lens' through which to view
<br>
reality.  There is only one reality of course, but
<br>
there appear to be 7 different 'mapping methods'
<br>
through which a rational mind can describe that
<br>
reality.  I shall call these 7 different mapping
<br>
methods 'Cognitive modes' and have labelled each of
<br>
them with a word beginning with 'M' to make them easy
<br>
to remember.
<br>
<p>Physical description (Cognitive mode:  'Matter'):
<br>
<p>We can describe the world in terms of material
<br>
properties.
<br>
<p>Example:  'The dogs are hairy'
<br>
<p>Mathematical description (Cognitive mode: 'Maths'):
<br>
<p>We can describe the world in terms of relational
<br>
(mathematical) properties.
<br>
<p>Example:  'There are two dogs'
<br>
<p><p>Experiential description (Cognitive mode: 'Mentality')
<br>
<p>We can describe the world in terms of its effect on us
<br>
- how it feels and is perceived by a sentient
<br>
<p>Example:  'That dog is cute!'
<br>
<p><p>Ethical description (Cognitive mode: 'Meaning')
<br>
<p>We can describe the world in terms of our relationship
<br>
to it - what role we play, especially our
<br>
relationships with other sentients.
<br>
<p>Example:  'I am the owner of the dog.  I look after
<br>
it'
<br>
<p><p>Computational description (Cognitive mode: 'Model'):
<br>
<p>We can describe the world in terms of its
<br>
informational, functional properties (the language of
<br>
complex systems)
<br>
<p>Example:  'The dog barks, eats, wags it's tail etc'
<br>
<p><p>Moral description (Cognitive mode: 'Morality')
<br>
<p>We can describe the world in terms of its possible
<br>
*use* to sentients.  How something could be used, how
<br>
we shall live.
<br>
<p>Example:  'Dogs make good pets and help the
<br>
ecosystem!'
<br>
<p>Volitional description (Cognitive mode: 'Mind')
<br>
<p>The highest level of description.  We can describe the
<br>
world in terms of generic events or 'mental episodes'
<br>
and extrapolate them back and forward in time
<br>
(imagination and memory).
<br>
<p>Example:  'I think back to all the dogs I knew and
<br>
imagine new situations where I predict what dogs will
<br>
do'
<br>
<p><p>Is there a mapping between the 7 different kinds of
<br>
cognitive description?  My proposed mappings follow:
<br>
<p><p>'Model map' = 
<br>
Superposition ( 'Matter map', 'Maths map')
<br>
<p>The 'model' mode of describing something is obtained
<br>
by superimposing two other descriptions:  A physical
<br>
description and a mathematical description.
<br>
<p>'Morality map' =
<br>
Superposition ( 'Mentality map', 'Meaning map')
<br>
<p>The 'morality' mode of describing something is
<br>
obtained by superimposing two other descriptions: An
<br>
ethical description and an experiential description.
<br>
<p><p>'Mind map' =
<br>
Superposition ('Model map', 'Morality map')
<br>
<p>The 'Mind' mode of describing something is obtained by
<br>
superimposing two other descriptions:  A system
<br>
description (a model) and a moral description.
<br>
<p><p>Look again at my suggested 7 universal categories of
<br>
cognition.  Note the way I've ordered them:
<br>
<p>Mentality map
<br>
Meaning map
<br>
Morality map
<br>
*Mind map*
<br>
Model map
<br>
Maths map
<br>
Matter map
<br>
<p>The first three categories of cognition are concerned
<br>
with reasoning about mental experiences.  The last
<br>
three are concerned with reasoning about physical and
<br>
logical things.  Note that the 'Mind' map is the odd
<br>
one out, so has been placed in the middle and marked
<br>
with asterisks.
<br>
<p>Go back to my proposed mappings.  The first mapping I
<br>
suggested was a superposition of the Maths map and the
<br>
Matter map.  This resulted in a 'Model'.  Note that
<br>
'Model map' has been placed closer to the center of my
<br>
list, indicating that it's a higher level of
<br>
description and is in some sense 'closer' to what an
<br>
animate object is (Computation is a sort of 'halfway
<br>
house' between mind and matter).
<br>
<p>The second mapping I suggested was a superposition of
<br>
the Mentality map and the Meaning map.  This resulted 
<br>
in a 'Morality'.  Note that the 'Morality map' has
<br>
also been placed closer to the center of my list,
<br>
again, indicating that it's a higher level of
<br>
description and is in some 'closer' to what an
<br>
inanimate thing (it's more abstract than pure
<br>
experience or interactions).  So again, we've reached
<br>
a way of describing the world which is a sort of
<br>
'halfway house' between mind and matter.
<br>
<p>So what is happening through these mappings, is that
<br>
our descriptions of the animate and the inanimate are
<br>
in some sense 'coming closer together'.  At one pole
<br>
is a purely objective description in terms of
<br>
inanimate things (the 'Matter map').  At the other
<br>
pole is a purely subjective description in terms of
<br>
sentient experiences (the 'Mentality map').
<br>
<p>By superimposing the Matter map on the Maths map we
<br>
obtained a new way of describing the world (the 'Model
<br>
map' - i.e a systems or computational mode of
<br>
description).  This is a sort of half-way house
<br>
between the objective and the subjective.
<br>
<p>By superimposing the Mentality map on the Meaning map
<br>
we obtained another new way of the describing the
<br>
world (the 'Morality' map), which again is a sort of
<br>
halfway house between the objective and subjective.
<br>
<p>Now it's time to look at the final proposed mapping: 
<br>
What happens when we superimpose a Morality map on a
<br>
Model map?  The proposed result was the Mind map. 
<br>
This final mapping in some sense finally reconciles
<br>
the subjective and objective.  So one would say that
<br>
Mind is the *bridge* between the objective and the
<br>
subjective.  Hence it's special place in the center of
<br>
the list.
