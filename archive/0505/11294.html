<p>
Here's a fascinating paragraph from a recent &quot;Edge.org&quot; debate on gender and 
<br>
cognition.  You can see an excellent example of a prominant scientist 
<br>
&quot;steven pinker&quot; catching a fleeting glimpse of &quot;the way&quot; pointing it out, 
<br>
and then turning his back on it.
<br>
<p>PINKER: Regarding bias: as I mentioned at the outset, I don't doubt that 
<br>
bias exists. But the idea that the bias started out from some arbitrary coin 
<br>
flip at the dawn of time and that gender differences have been perpetuated 
<br>
ever since by the existence of that bias is extremely unlikely. In so many 
<br>
cases, as Eagly and the Stereotype-Accuracy people point out, the biases are 
<br>
accurate. Also, there's an irony in these discussion of bias. When we test 
<br>
people in the cognitive psychology lab, and we don't call these base rates 
<br>
&quot;gender,&quot; we applaud people when they apply them. If people apply the 
<br>
statistics of a group to an individual case, we call it rational Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning, and congratulate ourselves for getting them to overcome the 
<br>
cognitive illusion of base rate neglect. But when people do the same thing 
<br>
in the case of gender, we treat Bayesian reasoning as a cognitive flaw and 
<br>
base-rate neglect as rational! Now I agree that applying base rates for 
<br>
gender in evaluating individual men and women is a moral flaw; I don't think 
<br>
that base rates ought to be applied in judging individuals in most cases of 
<br>
public decision-making. But the fact that the statistics of a gender are 
<br>
applied does not mean that their origin was arbitrary; it could be 
<br>
statistically sound in some cases.
