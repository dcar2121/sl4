<p>Oh no, it's not relying on a Last Judge I'm uncomfortable with; it's
<br>
not ideal, but it's better than a lot of possible alternatives.
<br>
<p>The first problem is: _how does the Last Judge know what the course
<br>
currently contemplated will lead to_? The AI shows him? By what
<br>
algorithm is that vision computed? (Given that where complex
<br>
self-improving information processing systems are concerned there is
<br>
in general no faster way to predict the future than to implement it,
<br>
one can a priori suggest there won't be such an algorithm.)
<br>
<p>The second problem: suppose you had an accurate enough algorithm, what
<br>
will the feedback loop of wish - show - change wish based on vision
<br>
produce? (My intuition for what it's worth is that the errors in the
<br>
algorithm will be quicker and easier to find than a genuinely good
<br>
future; cf. various genetic programming experiments.)
<br>
<p>The third problem: if all humanity are really confined in the same
<br>
trajectory to bite at one another like rats in a box, what makes you
<br>
think all the nastier political instincts won't come out, complete
<br>
with finding the Last Judge most acceptable to the toughest and
<br>
nastiest faction?
<br>
<p>The fourth, fifth and sixth problems are things I haven't thought of
<br>
yet. (What, you expected one human brain to think of _all_ the
<br>
problems in something that complicated, sensitive and dangerous? :))
<br>
How much do you want to bet none of them are deadly?
<br>
<p>But suppose you can overcome all of those: Collective Volition
<br>
requires convergence, Domain Protection does not. So at the last I
<br>
will suggest: try CV then if you must, but keep DP ready as a fallback
<br>
in case the volition does not converge.
