<em>&gt; it. I could stand for some ironic detachment or mental flex for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change. Hip and avante-garde is good, when surrounded by zealots. Not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caring is refreshing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, our lit-crit is getting confused here, IMO.
<br>
<p>Avant-garde is certainly not contradictory to
<br>
passionate/romantic/overemotional.
<br>
<p>Read some Kathy Acker, for example ;-)
<br>
<p>My own in-progress Singularity &quot;novel&quot; (about 60% done, to be finished in
<br>
the distant future before the Singularity but after the Novamente books) is
<br>
perhaps excessively avante-garde (as much a lunatic prose-poem as a novel)
<br>
yet definitely not devoid of human emotions...
<br>
<p>I agree that adding melodramatic love story themes to Diaspora would not
<br>
have improved it.  I think Diaspora made the points it was trying to make,
<br>
and depicted the images it was trying to depict, just about perfectly.
<br>
<p>However, I also think one could write a posthuman novel with a great deal
<br>
more emotional resonance than (e.g.) Diaspora or Transcension, WITHOUT
<br>
adding a bunch of melodramatic cliches.  It would be difficult, sure -- but
<br>
writing great literature is ALWAYS difficult, isn't it?
<br>
