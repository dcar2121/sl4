<br>
<p>Dear Jef,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find it interesting to consider the parallels between aesthetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciation and moral reasoning, each considered within a context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater awareness.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;     It still baffled me as to exactly what restrictions were being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     placed on the choice of the notes themselves. This was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     twelve-tone music, all the tones were not being used. Yet it wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     tonal in the sense of our system of keys. The structure was more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     complicated than anything I had heard before. I had the strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     impression of rules depending somehow on the form of the work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     itself. It was as if the rules, the restrictions, depended on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     place in the piece. The rules at the beginning and those at the end
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     seemed different, and different again from those in the middle. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     was as if the large-scale development of the work influenced its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     manner of construction.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of a musical structure not as being governed by 'rules', but
<br>
rather as the emergent product of a specific 'grammar' and we have a sound
<br>
idea of what the emergence process is in classical music thanks to the
<br>
techniques of layer analysis. By 'grammar' I mean something closer to
<br>
Kauffman's 'autocatalytic set' - the elements, combinatorialities and
<br>
transformations inherent in diatonic, modal or 12-tone systems. In music
<br>
(IMHO) aesthetic appreciation derives from one's ability to perceive and
<br>
appreciate the interplay between deep and surface level unfoldings (I speak
<br>
of unfoldings since we are talking about the evolution of structure in
<br>
time). Musical memory is an essential part of this appreciation. The deep
<br>
structures are not consciously perceived during listening, but are directly
<br>
active subconscious awareness. IMHO one's level of moral reasoning is
<br>
directly proportional to one's level (or depth) of awareness of both
<br>
structure and function. It is also crucially dependent on the nature of the
<br>
grammar employed (this goes back to Plato of course).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the most fundamental level of classical form (the Ursatz) there lies
<br>
a splitting function - the Urlinie (I-V-I or I IV-V-I). Mid- and surface
<br>
level structure consists of an interplay between the expression and
<br>
resolution of this greatly expanded splitting function. The splitting
<br>
dynamic is also fundamental to the earliest phases of physical and
<br>
psychological development and this accounts for the very deep and complex
<br>
character of musical appreciation. Given a complex and subtle grammar,
<br>
appreciation of the means by which the conflict engendered by the splitting
<br>
dynamic are resolved is an aid to moral reasoning since the latter arises
<br>
through an ability to understand, and therefore appreciate, the complexities
<br>
of life. Technical mastery of the surface structures is insufficient - hence
<br>
the paradox, in 'Schindler's List', of a Nazi officer playing Bach while the
<br>
inhabitants of the Krakow Ghetto are being murdered around him. For an
<br>
individual like this, the splitting dynamic is deeply repressed
<br>
psychologically, hence very active in surface behaviour. The significance of
<br>
the deeper structure of what he's actually playing remains inaccessible (the
<br>
same goes for Hannibal Lecter!).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schoenberg's 'A Survivor from Warsaw' (op.44) is a 12-tone work that
<br>
makes one of the most powerful moral statements of all time. The seeming
<br>
dissociation of the 12-tone system from the emotive clichés of diatonicism
<br>
makes this moral impact all the greater. The basic 12-tone set is
<br>
constructed from the intervallic properties of one of the synagogue
<br>
cantillations of the 'Shema Yisroel'. The emergence of this hymn from the
<br>
surrounding 12-tone chaos of the orchestration is so powerful - you have to
<br>
hear it to believe it (it's on a CD of Schoenberg's American works -
<br>
Schoenberg in America 1934-1951, CD no. SMK 62022).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Coincidentally, this week I read _October The First Is Too Late_ by Sir
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fred Hoyle, 1966, because someone said it presented an interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory of time.  While I didn't find anything that struck me as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting or informative about time, I did find this inspiring passage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about a musical competition between an accomplished human composer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his opponent, posing as a god but actually a posthuman:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     I mention all this to show why it wasn't in any way easy even for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     trained musician to grasp instantly what was going on. Plainly I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to deal with a subtle and complex form. My last thought of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     people outside was that they could hardly find the music of the god
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     easier to comprehend than my own. I think it was at this point, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the second of my opponent's sections came to an end, that the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     chill of apprehension swept over me...
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two atonal works I find profoundly moving are Ligeti's 'Requiem'  and
<br>
'Lux Aeterna' (parts of which are heard in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Oddysey).
<br>
You should see the score for the 'Requiem' - it's about three feet long and
<br>
six inches wide! IMHO this work expresses a powerful posthuman vision. The
<br>
surface texture of the work seems chaotic or aleatoric. It isn't. It's very
<br>
precisely notated using various devices such as inverse and retrograde
<br>
canons, carefully orchestrated tonal clusters etc. Who is the requiem for? I
<br>
think it's for the humanity that the 'transformed' have left behind. Do the
<br>
transformed weep or exult? Both, I think. Every time I hear it it gives me
<br>
the heebie-jeebies...
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>Paul
