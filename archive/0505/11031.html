<p>
I think my position in history will be as an intelligent observer. I 
<br>
don't think I have the ability to actually build a proper AI, but I 
<br>
think I could largely understand one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Tennessee,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You're right, we face some high hurdles, but I'm not sure the answer is to stop trying to clear them; adopting the belief that we will successfully end up at the other end of the track.  We're just not that good, and reality *doesn't* care.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Question 1:  If Friendliness is likely to arise anyway, what are the consequences of pursuing it with due speed?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No harm is done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Question 2:  If Friendliness is not likely to arise, what are the relative consequences of not pursuing it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think this could be re-worked. If Friendliness is not likely to arise, 
<br>
what things should we pursue? Rather than only trying to build the first 
<br>
AI, should we be trying to work on &quot;proofs&quot; for the value of morality, 
<br>
or working out how to strap it on later etc...? Or perhaps we should 
<br>
consider the form of AI development post the first convincing AI. 
<br>
However quickly AI may progress in geological timescales, it's unlikely 
<br>
to do so fast that humans can play no role in shaping its development. 
<br>
It seems more fruitful to me to consider the transition phase with more 
<br>
interest.
<br>
<p>Perhaps friendliness would turn out to be an idea rather than something 
<br>
hard-wired - an idea sufficiently convincing that AIs will choose to 
<br>
adopt it.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
