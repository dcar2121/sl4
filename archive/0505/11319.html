</em><br>
<p>Writing a requirements document for an FAI is a massive task
<br>
in itself; it's hard to pick good Friendliness content and it's
<br>
hard to define it in engineering terms rather than fuzzy
<br>
humanistic terms. I suppose there is a parallel with commercial
<br>
software design, in that it's hard to design good business
<br>
processes for systems to fit into and it's hard to get a spec
<br>
out of the customer that is both specific and what they actually
<br>
want (and this is before you even start designing the software).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you have broken the system into manageable pieces, you

</em><br>
<p>Part of the difficulty of AGI design is that it doesn't modularise
<br>
easily into a set of cleanly seperated components with narrow
<br>
interfaces and distinct functionality. It will modularise into
<br>
relatively intuitive components and organisational layers with
<br>
multiple functions and fuzzy boundaries (a scheme used by the
<br>
brain), which improves the chance of an educated guesswork design
<br>
working, but doesn't help much with clean formal design.
<br>
Alternatively AGI will modularise into a dense heterarchy of
<br>
functional components with well defined boundaries and interfaces
<br>
but a complex tangle of causal relationships and many layers of
<br>
indirection from the hardware to familiar CogSci concepts. This
<br>
is much more amenable to formal analysis, but is harder to develop
<br>
and explain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The SIAI approach relies on achieving complete understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of how the design works before building it. This means
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; specifying global behaviour first and breaking that down into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; progressively more local behaviour until you have code. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the aerospace industry in which I work, this is a part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the methodology we call 'systems engineering'. It's not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfect process... there is a feedback up and down the tree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the definition and design is done.
</em><br>
<p>Practical FAI design involves juggling constraints, all of which
<br>
are ultimately probabilistic. At the top level there are constraints
<br>
on the range of behaviour that we want the AGI to exhibit, which we
<br>
want to show have a very high probability of being satisfied. On
<br>
the other hand we aren't required to prove that an AGI will be
<br>
computationally tractable before running it; if we build a seed AI
<br>
that is Friendly but twelve orders of magnitude too slow to do
<br>
anything useful, no harm is done. Equally if we build an AGI that
<br>
we can prove will reliably and safely shut down before departing
<br>
from Friendly behaviour, that's safe too. Obviously we'd prefer to
<br>
establish ahead of time a high probability of the design actually
<br>
working, but the acceptable probabilities for this are much much
<br>
lower than the acceptable probability that the design will be safe.
<br>
Personally I'm prepared to use empirical evidence of whether
<br>
algorithms are computationally tractable if the time it would take
<br>
to understand their exact performance characteristics doesn't
<br>
deliver worthwhile returns; more understanding is always good, but
<br>
we're on a tight schedule.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you have to be careful that any changes to the requirements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and design are propagated through the tree so that (a) the overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system still does what you wanted it to, and (b) the pieces will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still work together.
</em><br>
<p>Definitely.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The methodology takes a lot of manpower to implement,
</em><br>
<p>True, which is why I believe we need to develop better tools as we
<br>
go to speed things up.
