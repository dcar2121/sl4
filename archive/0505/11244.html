<p>Some of them are, some of them aren't (in my new novel, I mean).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Rationality is not about emotionlessness, and neither is intelligence
</em><br>
<p>Indeed; I've made the same point many times. I think the reviewers' problem 
<br>
is not with a lack of portrayed emotion, because as far as I can see the 
<br>
characters are frequently emotional. It has something to do with the 
<br>
reader's emotional response to the big strange ideas and big vistas I bring 
<br>
to the canvas. These ideas are commonplace on a site like SL4, or among 
<br>
old-time extropians. I think even for us, having them come thick and fast 
<br>
in what amounts to an opera without music is still emotionally evocative. 
<br>
But some readers, this is just infodumping. Sigh.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The Singularity is not an ironic commentary on the rate of change. &lt;snip &gt;
</em><br>
<p>Interesting thoughts, Eliezer, and I thank you for them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When you wrote about _SitS_ in _The Spike_, you wrote, &quot;Well, of course, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one smiles, recalling the exaggerated postures of adolescence.&quot;  Being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rather fond of that youthful Eliezer, you attached no particular utility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to hurting his feelings;
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, or his feelings, but this is a risk 
<br>
whenever public commentary is made on a highly personalised text.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;yet you found it necessary to insert *something* that would make clear 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your emotional detachment.  Why?  Because you had to avoid, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;automatically avoided, a scenario in which your readers might think you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cared about something
</em><br>
<p>Not so. (More exactly, what parlour psychoanalytic drivel.) I was an adult 
<br>
speaking -- as I saw it, predominantly -- to adults, drawing on some 
<br>
brilliant and passionate writing about an urgent topic very few people had 
<br>
considered until then, writing unfortunately distorted precisely by &quot;the 
<br>
exaggerated postures of adolescence.&quot; I wanted people to take the ideas 
<br>
seriously, without dismissing them for the wrong reason. Possibly this 
<br>
tactic worked. Again, though, I apologise that my using it caused bruising. 
<br>
But hey, what are a few lumps compared with getting the singularity here 
<br>
faster and more safely, stopping those deaths, everything young Eliezer was 
<br>
shouting about at the top of his voice.
