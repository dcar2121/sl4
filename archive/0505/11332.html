<p>
The debate about minimum compute power required for AGI in general
<br>
and brain simulation in particular is relevant and open, but something
<br>
of a dead horse for the SL4 list. However;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 100 to 100,000 Tflops assumes simulating a parallel process on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serial computing substrate correct? How then does the advent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parallel hardware such as the Cell Processor (2 Tflops each)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factor into the calculation?
</em><br>
<p>Firstly absolute compute power is a distinct measurement from the
<br>
parallelisability of a particular computation. In a wholly serial
<br>
process the dependency between calculations forms a single chain.
<br>
In a wholly parallel operation (e.g. vector multiplication) every
<br>
calculation can be performed independently. In addition to the
<br>
absolute parallelisability of a process (i.e. minimum serial
<br>
step count and minimum parallelism required to achieve this),
<br>
computational and memory locality is very important as they
<br>
determine internode and CPU-memory bandwidth requirements.
<br>
<p>Secondly the Cell processor /does not/ have a capability of 2
<br>
teraflops. This is the claimed 'total system performance' of the
<br>
PS3, the vast majority of which is contributed by the dedicated
<br>
graphics processor. The document you linked to only claims 300
<br>
gigaflops and that is both out of date (for the PS3 at least the
<br>
Cell will have 7 SPEs not 8 and will run at 3.2 GHz not 4.6 GHz)
<br>
and wildly optimistic. Looking at the functional units, instruction
<br>
set and issue width of the Cell it has a theoretical peak capacity
<br>
of around 200 gigaflops, assuming the bulk of your computation
<br>
consists of vector operations on 32-bit floats (16-bit data will
<br>
double that). However for various reasons the IPC of the cell is
<br>
likely to be relatively low, so it's unlikely that any practial
<br>
code will exceed 100 gigaflops. That's still very impressive, but
<br>
it's 20 times lower than the impression you gave and even that
<br>
relies on AGI code being reasonably parallelisable at the vector,
<br>
instruction and thread level. I'm excited about the Cell too, but
<br>
lets not get carried away by the waves of spin and PR.
