Eliezer,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schild's Ladder had more conflict and the accompanying passion.
<br>
Egan pulled off some of my favorite characterization of all time in
<br>
Distress, but that was not about posthumans.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's great about the transhumanist authors is that they attempt
<br>
to step outside the assumptions built into our meat-based substrate,
<br>
on which literature seems to have almost always depended. Granted,
<br>
posthumans don't have to be that way, but where is there a better
<br>
opportunity to play with it?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aspects which you lament are the attributes that mark my
<br>
favorite fiction. The world is swimming in melodramas full of
<br>
sympathetic characters and Romanticist operatic swellings of passion.
<br>
This has an important place, but I'm stifled by the sheer volume of
<br>
it. I could stand for some ironic detachment or mental flex for a
<br>
change. Hip and avante-garde is good, when surrounded by zealots. Not
<br>
caring is refreshing. In fact, perhaps this is why I enjoy reading the
<br>
Orion's Arm website or David Pulver's roleplaying sourcebooks for
<br>
GURPS: Transhuman Space just as much as I enjoy reading a story that
<br>
actually has one iota of characters, plot, and drama.
