<p><em>&gt;     Schoenberg's 'A Survivor from Warsaw'

<p>I don't know this piece but will seek it out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; You should see the score for the 'Requiem' -

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Lux Aeterna, Requiem, and Atospheres from the
<br>
2001 soundtrack are indelible. I have a copy of
<br>
this soundtrack, and one of Kubrick's great
<br>
strengths as a filmmaker was his radar for
<br>
finding the right music. There is a piece of
<br>
soundtrack music at the climax of Full Metal
<br>
Jacket which deserves mention in this context, a
<br>
savage-sounding march of sorts with what sounds
<br>
like a hinge in bad need of oiling. Unfortunately
<br>
I can't seem to find info on this piece without
<br>
hunting up a DVD of the film.
<br>
<p>I have to say, though, that I never really
<br>
thought of this music as 'atonal'. The chorus,
<br>
being a collection of individual singers, had to
<br>
sing individual notes, did they not? What does
<br>
the score tell them to do? To sing &quot;inverse and
<br>
retrograde canons, carefully orchestrated tonal
<br>
clusters etc.&quot; Ligeti simply is not relying on
<br>
the old, predictable rules about what tones
<br>
'belong' while employing some venerable
<br>
strategies for the creation of structure, to
<br>
create something genuinely new.
<br>
Many listeners assume atonal music is 'tennis
<br>
without a net,' or simply noise, as noted in one
<br>
of the articles previously mentioned in this
<br>
thread (the other was a dead link). I found Brian
<br>
Eno's observation interesting: he said that
<br>
people who complained that 'popular' music had
<br>
hit a dead end were simply looking in the wrong
<br>
place for the innovation, and that many artists
<br>
were content to use old structures and forms as a
<br>
frame for experimentation in textures.
<br>
As I have noted elsewhere, it's getting harder
<br>
all the time to create something that someone
<br>
hasn't beaten you to; in a musical context, this
<br>
tends to necessitate longer, more complex
<br>
phrases, since the simple ones have been done to
<br>
death. Permutation City, you know. I can't tell
<br>
you how many people I hear banging on guitars in
<br>
4/4 time and wondering why they have trouble
<br>
coming up with a new sound.
<br>
To end on an amusing note: I read an article
<br>
about Lou Reed's infamously unlistenable 'Metal
<br>
Machine Music' album, in which the article's
<br>
author called up the record company to ask if
<br>
they were going to reissue it. They laughed and
<br>
hung up.
