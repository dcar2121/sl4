<em>&gt;&gt;Stories about posthumans usually don't work because these posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;characters do not (or shouldn't) share much of our humanity, and by that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mean our fallibility, and this is why the audience struggles to form an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;empathetic bond with these characters. On the other hand, making a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;posthuman act like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;human doesn't make sense, just like portraying a human character acting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;a bacteria wouldn't (Ok, they both eat and move, but that's about all they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;have in common). All this means that writing credible and moving stories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about posthumans is futile. Fortunately, there should be plenty of space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;*around* the problem. :)
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It has been explored around the edges.  Vinge creates his &quot;zones of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought&quot; to have a universe where some of the characters are less than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;gods.
</em><br>
<p>It's certainly a step in the right direction. Conflict is what fuels any 
<br>
story and allows it to move forward. The most boring story would be one 
<br>
about paradise where almighty gods have the capacity to resolve any conflict 
<br>
they may face within their reality.
<br>
<p>Any good story is a reflection of human experience which consists of 
<br>
problems and our struggles to overcome the limits of our human nature in 
<br>
order to solve these problems. Stories that capture these struggles resonate 
<br>
emotionally with us because they contain recognizable truth found in our own 
<br>
lives. God's reality that lacks conflict is alien to our experience. Humans 
<br>
can only care about things that pertain to their existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You certainly can have human characters in a post singularity world, sort 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of like we have Amish in our world but far more extreme.
</em><br>
<p>IMO, throwing 100% human characters into a posthuman world is the only way 
<br>
to make a post-singularity story work if the goal is to give the audience an 
<br>
emotionally meaningful experience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what are the characters to accomplish in such a world?  It's a world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with gods or (if  Eliezer does it right) one friendly god.
</em><br>
<p>Even within fictional world ruled by almighty Humane AI there should be 
<br>
plenty of room to present a moving and credible human story. There is huge 
<br>
amount of things that a human could accomplish in such a world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a world where humans have less influence on important matters that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect the future then cockroaches.
</em><br>
<p>This shouldn't happen if Friendliness is done right. But I guess it depends 
<br>
on what we mean by &quot;important matters&quot; and our understanding of how 
<br>
Friendliness should work. From what I understand about Friendliness and 
<br>
Collective Volition we should have enough influence over our lives and our 
<br>
happiness. There should be many interesting human stories a writer could 
<br>
weave within a fictional world ruled by Humane AI.
<br>
<p>This, of course, doesn't mean it's easy. My experience as a student of 
<br>
storytelling craft tells me that post-singularity stories are one of the 
<br>
most difficult to write, that is, if the goal is to create logically 
<br>
consistent, scientifically correct, and, above all, moving stories. It's 
<br>
hard enough to create emotionally meaningful story set in pre-singularity 
<br>
world, let alone one that happens after Singularity.
