<p>
Damien,
<br>
<p>This reminds me of conversations I used to have with my friend Jeff Pressing
<br>
(an American who was a psych prof at the University of Melbourne, and also
<br>
an accomplished jazz, classical and West-African-percussion
<br>
composer/musician ... for a while he was head of the music school at LaTrobe
<br>
University... unfortunately, he died of a fluke meningitis infection a few
<br>
years back...).
<br>
<p>Anyway, I compose and play music as well, and though I'm nowhere near as
<br>
erudite or technically skilled as Jeff in the musical domain, I was never
<br>
quite sure I wanted to be.  I always felt that his compositions, though
<br>
wonderfully subtle and intricate and learned and often beautiful (and
<br>
integrating ideas from nearly every form of music ever created on Earth),
<br>
lacked some human emotional OOMPH!! that I tried to put into my own
<br>
(significantly simpler) music.  Now Jeff was by no means lacking in
<br>
emotional OOMPH!! himself ... far from it ... he was a nerd of sorts, but
<br>
his personal and emotional and social life had a lot of different dimensions
<br>
...
<br>
<p>But what he always said to me, when I complained about this (we had this
<br>
conversation repeatedly), was, &quot;Ben, I learned a long time ago how to evoke
<br>
human emotions through music.  It's not very hard to elicit powerful
<br>
feelings in people by arranging chords and notes in the right way.  But I
<br>
just lost interest in those very simple equations a long time ago.  The
<br>
patterns in the music I'm making now are a lot more subtle and interesting.&quot;
<br>
<p>I'd reply something obnoxious like &quot;Well, if it's so easy to elicit powerful
<br>
feelings in people via music, then how come you've never written anything as
<br>
good at evoking human feelings as the Jupiter Symphony, or Beethoven's
<br>
Ninth, or Round Midnight....&quot;
<br>
<p>His response then would depend on his mood.  Sometimes he'd say that those
<br>
pieces of music, though good in their own way, didn't really interest him
<br>
anyway.  When he was in his &quot;detached and superior musical snob&quot; mode, he
<br>
viewed these great compositions the same way I might view the bronzed and
<br>
hulking flesh of an exquisitely well-toned bodybuilder -- outstanding in its
<br>
own way, but not the sort of thing that really gets me excited....
<br>
<p>Modern classical music, and to an extent modern jazz as well, have left
<br>
behind the need to pander to human emotions, and are in large part exploring
<br>
realms of musical structure that don't interact so intensely with the
<br>
particular dynamical patterns of interaction and fluctuation that
<br>
characterize human feeling.
<br>
<p>Personally, I like many instances of this sort of music -- but it's never my
<br>
*absolute favorite*, it never moves me as much as Mozart or Monk or Paganini
<br>
or Jimi Hendrix, who explicitly *do* pander to my human emotions, who
<br>
explicitly arrange notes and sounds in familiar forms that elicit feelings
<br>
of anger, love, wonder, confusion, relaxation and so forth within me....  I
<br>
can see that these composers and musicians are playing with my
<br>
neurophysiological responses in a fairly simplistic way, compared to the
<br>
patterns existing in the music of Jeff and other more modern and
<br>
sophisticated composers -- but as a human being, I *like* having my
<br>
neurophysiological responses played with in that way.  And of course,
<br>
getting that &quot;simplistic&quot; manipulation so wonderfully right still takes a
<br>
lot of art and science....
<br>
<p>Anyway, I haven't read your new novel yet but I got a similar vibe from your
<br>
novel Transcension, even though the characters were real humans living real
<br>
lives.  Partly because the reality they were living in seemed so tenuous,
<br>
and partly because of your patterns of focus and language in describing the
<br>
characters and their actions, it was hard for me to feel really emotionally
<br>
attached to any of the characters.  This did make the novel less appealing
<br>
to me than others of similar quality, in certain ways; yet it also made it
<br>
more appealing, in other ways ... because it provoked thoughts and feelings
<br>
about the nature of mind/feeling/reality that more conventional novels don't
<br>
tend to provoke.
<br>
<p>I suppose that truly transhumanist fiction lives in the same artistic space
<br>
as modern classical music, in the sense that it's constructing and evoking
<br>
interesting, intricate patterns that happen not to be closely cued to human
<br>
body-responses.  In a sense these more abstract, body-detached art genres
<br>
will never be as gripping as their more human-body-centered, &quot;primitive&quot;
<br>
counterparts -- but as the Singularity approaches, they may come to have a
<br>
greater and greater appeal even so....  Personally I find such works of art
<br>
fascinating precisely because of the META-FEELING they evoke --- the way
<br>
they acutely sensitize me to the fact that I am a human body and so much of
<br>
what I think is important and interesting is cued to my physiological
<br>
responses and evolutionary biases.
<br>
<p>One thing that would be interesting to see in a sci-fi novel would be a
<br>
character who the reader DOES intensely care about, because he/she has been
<br>
developed in a loving and careful manner characteristic of high-quality
<br>
traditional literature, who THEN becomes transhuman, rational,
<br>
emotionally-detached and MORE INTERESTING but yet LESS EMOTIONALLY GRIPPING
<br>
to the reader.  This would solve the artistic problem you mention, in a
<br>
sense, and it would have a powerful impact on the reader in terms of making
<br>
the aesthetic difficulties I've been discussing explicit as part of the
<br>
story's theme.
<br>
<p>-- Ben

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an interesting review of my new sf novel GODPLAYERS. The reviewer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially exercised by the fact that my posthuman characters are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately understandable -- indeed, beyond empathy -- by human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;the frustration level mounts as one waits in vain... for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characters... to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; display any hint of a genuine inner life as they move randomly from scene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to scene, world to world, reality to reality. Perhaps Vorpal homunculi do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not possess inner lives, and Broderick's point is that these seeming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superhumans, for all their power, are soulless automatons without a shred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of humanity.... Surely there should be some character, somewhere in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; novel, to which human readers can feel connected. ...As the sequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events grows increasingly frenzied, with ever-greater reliance placed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what might be termed info-splatters, the lack of a deep humanistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrate left this reader, at least, with no ground to stand on. &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm torn in my response to this. On the one hand, it wouldn't make much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to write about posthumans as if they were representations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people down the road, or in the next room. On the other, I have tried to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ground the fairly breakneck narrative within thematic structures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverberations recognizable from myth, dream, and the traditions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science-fiction itself when it ventures upon the superhuman. Greg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Egan met
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this same objection, of course, and so, in various degrees, did John
</em><br>
<em>&gt; C. Wright and Charlie Stross. Maybe it's an artistic problem beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solution -- for humans.
</em><br>
