<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The SIAI approach relies on achieving complete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the design works before building it. This means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifying global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour first and breaking that down into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressively more local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviour until you have code. 
</em><br>
<p>In the aerospace industry in which I work, this is
<br>
a part of the methodology we call 'systems
<br>
engineering'.
<br>
The methodology as a whole is used to make it 
<br>
possible to do complicated projects like missile
<br>
defense or the Space Station.
<br>
<p>The breaking down of a complex design into simpler
<br>
components is only one part of what you have to do
<br>
if you want a reasonable chance of the final design
<br>
to do what you want it to.
<br>
<p>You start at the top level by describing what it
<br>
is you want the thing to do, in some detail.  We
<br>
call it a requirements document.  Then you go through
<br>
several levels of breaking the requirements into
<br>
smaller sets and assigning them to systems,
<br>
subsystems, assemblies, etc. Each time you break
<br>
the design into smaller pieces, you now have to 
<br>
define the interfaces between the pieces, and
<br>
maintain traceability up and down the tree of
<br>
requirements.
<br>
<p>Once you have broken the system into manageable
<br>
pieces, you can then proceed to design the pieces,
<br>
build them, and then test that they actually meet
<br>
the requirements that were specified at the lowest
<br>
level.  You assemble and test at progressively
<br>
higher levels until finally you test the complete
<br>
system as a whole.  It is the discipline of 
<br>
defining the requirements at each level and testing
<br>
against those requirements at each level that
<br>
constrains the design process.  That way the final
<br>
product has a reasonably high chance of working
<br>
and doing what you wanted it to.
<br>
<p>It's not a perfect process.  In the initial
<br>
requirements for the Space Station (on which I work),
<br>
there was a requirement for a 'Snap Freezer' to
<br>
freeze specimens that had been generated onboard
<br>
the Station for later analysis on the ground.  The
<br>
requirements as specified were physically impossible
<br>
to meet.  Even if the freezer was at absolute zero,
<br>
the sample wouldn't have cooled fast enough to meet
<br>
the written requirement, so the requirement had
<br>
to be changed to something possible.  So there is
<br>
a feedback up and down the tree as the definition
<br>
and design is done.  But you have to be careful
<br>
that any changes to the requirements and design
<br>
are propagated through the tree so that (a) the
<br>
overall system still does what you wanted it to,
<br>
and (b) the pieces will still work together.
<br>
<p>The methodology takes a lot of manpower to implement,
<br>
but it is the best way we know of to design things
<br>
that are too complicated for a single person or
<br>
a small team to do.
