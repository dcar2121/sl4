<em>&gt;The problem with writing fiction about posthumans, as some of you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mentioned already, lies in creating empathy. Any story driven by characters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that don't evoke empathy must fail.
</em><br>
<p>Well put.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If I don't care about the main character
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the story, preferably as soon as possible, I will remain inert to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;writer's even most sincere, and otherwise effective, attempts to make me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feel positive or negative emotions. I'll remain emotionally neutral because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I didn't care about the character in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A consumer of story forms an empathetic bond with a character only when he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;recognizes in the character his own humanity. At that moment the reader
</em><br>
<em>&gt;begins to identify with that character and starts to live vicariously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through the character. If the bond of empathy is strong enough, we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laugh and cry with the character. If that bond is too weak, the novel goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back on the shelf.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stories about posthumans usually don't work because these posthuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;characters do not (or shouldn't) share much of our humanity, and by that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean our fallibility, and this is why the audience struggles to form an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;empathetic bond with these characters. On the other hand, making a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;posthuman act like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;human doesn't make sense, just like portraying a human character acting like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a bacteria wouldn't (Ok, they both eat and move, but that's about all they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have in common). All this means that writing credible and moving stories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about posthumans is futile. Fortunately, there should be plenty of space 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*around* the problem. :)
</em><br>
<p>It has been explored around the edges.  Vinge creates his &quot;zones of 
<br>
thought&quot; to have a universe where some of the characters are less than gods.
<br>
<p>You certainly can have human characters in a post singularity world, sort 
<br>
of like we have Amish in our world but far more extreme.  But what are the 
<br>
characters to accomplish in such a world?  It's a world with gods or 
<br>
(if  Eliezer does it right) one friendly god.
<br>
<p>It is a world where humans have less influence on important matters that 
<br>
effect the future then cockroaches.
<br>
<p>(On the other hand, that's probably the situation for the vast majority of 
<br>
the human race today.)
