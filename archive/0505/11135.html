<em>&gt; unless you believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sole reason AGI hasn't been cracked yet is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inadequate computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  * Michael Wilson
</em><br>
<p>Not the sole reason, but a major reason.  I believe
<br>
there is a horizon for AGI that is a function of how
<br>
sophisticated your design is and how much computing
<br>
power you have.  At the brute force end of
<br>
sophistication, an accurate enough model of neurons
<br>
with enough neurons to equal a human brain should
<br>
work, because it works for us.  Depending on what
<br>
you think 'accurate enough' is, the computing power
<br>
required is estimated to be in the 100 to 100,000
<br>
TFlop
<br>
range.  The most powerful computer ever built, 
<br>
Blue Gene-L, has just cracked the lower boundary
<br>
of that range.  It will be a few more years before
<br>
any AI researchers get their hands on a machine that
<br>
powerful.  Thus, so far, inadequate computing
<br>
power has controlled at that end.
<br>
<p>Since evolution is non-directed, and neural
<br>
development
<br>
is likely sloppy and inefficent, I expect that
<br>
purposeful design should be able to work more
<br>
efficiently than a brute force simulation.
<br>
The unknown right now is how the slope of computing
<br>
power vs. design complexity runs.  Given the
<br>
high starting point at the simple simulation end
<br>
of the chart, I find it plausible we are still
<br>
below the required computing power horizon at all
<br>
points.
<br>
<p>As a made-up example, assume a brute force simulation
<br>
requires 3,000 TFlop, that a design team of 10 can
<br>
better that by a factor of 10, and that a design team
<br>
of 1000 can better that by another factor of 10.
<br>
30 Tflop is just becoming or will soon be available
<br>
in an academic setting, but as far as I know no AI
<br>
project has a 1000 person design team, and no one
<br>
has had 30 Tflop machines long enough to do the
<br>
software development or let the AI learn on its own.
<br>
<p>When 100 TFlop desktop PCs have been around for a
<br>
decade and we still don't have an AI, I'll tend to
<br>
think there is some other obstacle at work. Until
<br>
then or until someone provides convincing reasoning
<br>
that it will take vastly less computing power than
<br>
the rough estimates above, I'll tend to think the
<br>
problem has been insufficient computing power.
<br>
<p>The slope of the intelligence horizon contributes
<br>
to the likelyhood of a fast singularity.  When the
<br>
AI itself becomes part or all of the design team,
<br>
it can follow a trajectory that rapidly crosses
<br>
or moves above the horizon.  This can be a combination
<br>
of more efficient implementation on the same
<br>
hardware and replication on additional hardware.
<br>
If the slope of the intelligence horizon is steep
<br>
enough, it leads to a runaway improvement.  If the
<br>
slope is shallow, the improvements will converge
<br>
to a stable level.
