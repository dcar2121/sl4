At 01:24 PM 5/3/2005 -0500, I wrote:

</em><br>
<p>I hope this is not too off topic. But I'll offer a couple of quotes from 
<br>
the novel that seemed to me to refute the SF Weekly reviewer's suggestion. 
<br>
Here's one:
<br>
<p>==============
<br>
<p>Two men in some sort of emergency garb seized an obese woman dressed like a 
<br>
gaudy bird, helped her to an ambulance. Lune ran to them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you need help?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You a trained nurse?&quot; one of them shouted back. The uproar, she 
<br>
understood, was enormous, and against the racket of sirens and voices her 
<br>
own voice was nearly lost.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, but--'
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You need to get clear of the area if you're not medical or part 
<br>
of a firefighting crew.&quot; You don't have to yell at me, Lune found herself 
<br>
thinking, angry. A woman limped away from the buildings, in obvious pain.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me give you a hand.&quot; Lune offered her arm, and the woman 
<br>
leaned heavily against her shoulder. Her shoes were missing, her brown feet 
<br>
blackened, the geometric designs of her short sleeved huipil stained. A 
<br>
pretty receptionist, perhaps, made ugly by soot and the morning's mad cruelty.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I need to find a phone,&quot; the woman was saying. &quot;I have to call 
<br>
and let my husband know I'm okay.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll find you a phone. That store up ahead, they'll let you 
<br>
use their phone.&quot; The manager, wringing his hands, stern face grey under 
<br>
its paint, let the woman sit down but said the phone service was knocked 
<br>
out. Lune went back outside, started again for the ziggurat. At the curb, 
<br>
about to cross, she heard a roaring overhead. A fourth ballistic? She 
<br>
readied herself to open a threshold, peering up at the sky. The hot sun was 
<br>
high overhead. No. One entire side of the structure closest to her was 
<br>
peeling inward; shattering like a dream. She turned and ran as fast as she 
<br>
could, for a block, stopped and looked back. A mound of rubble and foul 
<br>
dusty smoke. The great pyramid had simply--disappeared.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, great woodlands filled with beasts and birds and a few 
<br>
humans covered this place, or places like it, she thought; in many worlds 
<br>
they still do so. Pristine creeks and sheltering forests. Cultures capable 
<br>
of living in unity with the natural order, whatever that was, whatever its 
<br>
source, however perverse its roots. White noise singing in her ears. 
<br>
Someone dragged her, with a jolt, under an awning. Dust and debris poured 
<br>
down. Coughing, she pulled her huipil blouse up over her mouth and nose to 
<br>
keep out the dust and smoke. This is what the deformist K-machines are 
<br>
doing, she told herself, crouched against the relative safety of the wall 
<br>
at her back. Someone or some thing deliberately flew semi-ballistics into 
<br>
that human-crowded building, struck them in just the right way to bring 
<br>
them down, and in the great cascade of shockwaves that would flow outward 
<br>
from this moment perhaps bring down the whole industrial civilization of a 
<br>
world, a sheaf of worlds. And they did it for the hot joy of the deed, the 
<br>
emotional excitement. It was a key part of the method of the Players and 
<br>
their adversaries, she knew that, and the knowledge was sourness in her 
<br>
mouth. Pick just the right fulcrum, the most vulnerable entry point for 
<br>
your chisel, and the damage you do will spread like fire. Growing, 
<br>
harvesting, building is hard work, sometimes bitterly effortful, but 
<br>
ruination is easy. You can make it all disappear. One person with the exact 
<br>
lever can destroy a reality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stumbling, amid the sirens and the sobs, Lune returned to the 
<br>
cafe. Soiled plates and half-empty glasses remained on the tables. Her 
<br>
Ensemble had left. Drawing a wrenching breath, she opened a Schwelle and 
<br>
followed them.
<br>
<p>================
<br>
<p>Here's a quite different sort:
<br>
<p>I stepped into a place of scintillating light. Two men stood loosely 
<br>
wrapped in bedsheets, gazing out with blinded rapture through an immense 
<br>
blister window at the grandeur of the new-born Angels at sport.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Decius,&quot; I called, voice breaking with emotion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One man turned his head slowly, like a man in a dream. My brother.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aren't they lovely?&quot; he said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked for a timeless time on the Omega godthings, shaken by 
<br>
their music and their dance. Somehow I held to some thread of my grief and 
<br>
purpose.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Decius, can you speak to them?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;May I, that's the question.&quot; His tone was low-pitched and slow, 
<br>
clotted with a kind of worshipful dread. &quot;I can call spirits from the vasty 
<br>
deep, but will they come when I do call for them?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was drunk, I saw. And from no grape.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Decius, take command of yourself, sir. Our parents are dead.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, so you are the lost brother, eh? No matter. They died long 
<br>
ago, boy. Doomsday comes to us all, soon enough, consult with brother Jules 
<br>
if you doubt it. In this place, if the Angels wish it, they shall live again.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took him angrily by the arm. His companion turned his head, 
<br>
looked at my passionate face with mild rebuke, swung back again to 
<br>
contemplation of the light-shot plenum.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They were not dead. Dramen and Angelica withdrew into 
<br>
concealment. Now they are dead in truth, and our brothers Marchmain and 
<br>
Toby with them.&quot; My voice broke. &quot;And one other.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, these are so beautiful! I have no parents. Hush, now.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am the child of their retreat. I love them, and I love Lune 
<br>
the more, you god-smitten imbecile,&quot; I raged, weeping, &quot;and you will 
<br>
recover them for me!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drew back my arm and slapped his face, hard. Beyond the 
<br>
blister, aeons were passing, worlds beyond worlds beyond worlds built in 
<br>
calculated simulation and recollection, histories re-run and devised from 
<br>
whole cloth. Somehow I knew all this, took instruction from the fringes of 
<br>
omniscient shadow that crossed Yggdrasil Station like currents in a great 
<br>
ocean tide at the shoreline of some insignificant atoll. Here, in this 
<br>
place, this closed space and time, the majesty and brutality of all the 
<br>
Tegmark levels was being rehearsed in infinite miniature, like half the sky 
<br>
captured perfectly in a single red droplet of wine at the bottom of a 
<br>
drained glass. I could have her here, in simulation, if I sought entry from 
<br>
the Angels. That was not what I desired. Let her live!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get her back for me,&quot; I told Decius and his companion, 
<br>
compelling them with my ardor, my steel-edged insistence. The Vorpal force 
<br>
in me blazed even in this radiant, numinous place. &quot;It is not too much to ask.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well,&quot; the man said, and closed his eyes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Omega Angel entered the blister.
<br>
<p>=======================
<br>
<p>Of course this is not the emotionality of a Jane Austen or even a Don De 
<br>
Lillo novel, but I find it extraordinary to see such characters dismissed 
<br>
as &quot;soulless automatons without a shred of humanity&quot;. But maybe that's 
<br>
exactly the hazard of such writing; that without the comforting orientation 
<br>
grid references to our daily lives (although dog knows the first extract is 
<br>
fairly blatant in providing one, by analogy), many readers are lost. Since 
<br>
I'm not especially eager to lose readers, I need to take all this under 
<br>
advisement.
