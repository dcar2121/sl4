<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because, I assume you want the Sysop to give each sentient being choice of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This begs the question of how to define what is a &quot;sentient being&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, I should have been more explicit about what it does _not_ assume;
<br>
if I clarify, perhaps it will look better defined (albeit of smaller
<br>
scope).
<br>
<p>I'm assuming the Sysop will _not_ know what constitutes a sentient
<br>
being, and we won't be able to formally define it either. This is the
<br>
big difference between domain protection and both of Eliezer's sysop
<br>
scenarios; I'm making more conservative assumptions about what will be
<br>
possible, and being more modest in the problems I try to solve.
<br>
<p>For purposes of setting up the domains, the rule can be simple: each
<br>
and every human on Earth (the ones who are old enough to make a
<br>
choice, at least) gets to decide what domain they want to move to (or
<br>
stay on Earth, of course); that's an operationally adequate definition
<br>
of &quot;sentient&quot; for that purpose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose I want to create a universe full of intelligent love-slaves... and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suppose there aren't any sentients who want to live their lives out as my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love-slaves.  So I create some androids that *act* like sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; love-slaves, but are *really* just robots with no feelings or awareness....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or wait, is this really possible?  Does sentience somehow come along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically with intelligence?  Does &quot;sentience&quot; as separate from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence really exist?  What ethical responsibilities exist to different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of minds with different ways of realizing intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>I don't have an answer to that one. I don't believe there is an answer
<br>
to it. It's going to come down to your conscience. As long as you're
<br>
in a domain that allows individuals to have large amounts of computing
<br>
power, there's no way to stop you doing the above (in virtual reality
<br>
at least) if you want to.
<br>
<p>Domain protection is a theory of how (if and when Friendly AI is
<br>
created) to safeguard the future of sentient life. It does not aspire
<br>
to being a theory of how to safeguard the rights of every individual
<br>
sentient being that will ever exist. I don't believe that's possible.
<br>
<p>Of course, I could be wrong. If someone _does_ come up with an answer
<br>
to your questions, by all means let that be added to domain
<br>
protection; they're not mutually exclusive.
<br>
<p>But I don't think that will happen. I don't know how to create
<br>
superintelligent Friendly AI, but I think at this stage I can vaguely,
<br>
dimly see how it is possible. But super-_wise_ AI, as I said in the
<br>
paper, I think is a Godel problem.
