<em>&gt; The problem here is that standard decision theory does not allow a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilistic mixture of outcomes to have a higher utility than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixture's expected utility, so a 50/50 chance of reaching either of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals A and B cannot have a higher utility than 100% chance of reaching A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a higher utility than 100% chance of reaching B, but that is what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed in this case in order for both AIs to agree to the merger.
</em><br>
<p>The obvious solution is to integrate the coin into the utility
<br>
function of the offspring.  I.e., &lt;coin heads, paperclips&gt; has 1 util,
<br>
&lt;coin tails, paperclips&gt; has 0 utils.
<br>
<p>Obvious solution 2 is to flip a quantum coin and have a utility
<br>
function that sums over Everett branches.  Obvious solution 3 is to
<br>
pick a mathematical question whose answer neither AI knows but which
<br>
can be computed cheaply using a serial computation long enough that
<br>
only the offspring will know.
<br>
<p>Of course, just because something is obvious doesn't mean it can't be flawed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The second example shows how a difference in the priors of two AIs, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to their utility functions, can have a similar effect. Suppose two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIs come upon an alien artifact which looks like a safe with a combination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lock. There is a plaque that says they can try to open the lock the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day, but it will cost $1 to try each combination. Each AI values the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contents of the safe at 3 utils, and the best alternative use of the $1 at 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utils. They also each think they have a good guess of the lock combination,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assigning a 90% probability of being correct, but their guesses are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different due to having different priors. They have until tomorrow to decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether to try their guesses or not, but in the mean time they have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide whether or not to merge. If they don't merge, they will each try a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess and expect to get .9*3=2.7 utils, but if they do merge into a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bayesian AI with an average of their priors, the new AI will assign .45
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of each guess being correct, and since the expected utility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying a guess is now .45 * 3 &lt; 2, it will decide not to try either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combination. The original AIs, knowing this, would refuse to merge.
</em><br>
<p>I presume you're localizing the difference to the priors, because if
<br>
the two AIs trust each other's evidence-gathering processes, Aumann
<br>
agreement prevents them from otherwise having a known disagreement
<br>
about posteriors.  But in general this is just a problem of the AIs
<br>
having different beliefs so that one AI expects the other AI to act
<br>
stupidly, and hence a merger to be more stupid than itself (though
<br>
wiser than the other).  But remember that the alternative to a merger
<br>
may be competition, or failure to access the resources of the other AI
<br>
- are the differences in pure priors likely to be on the same scale,
<br>
especially after Aumann agreement and the presumably large amounts of
<br>
washing-out empirical evidence are taken into account?
<br>
<p>I haven't read this whole thread, so I don't know if someone was
<br>
originally arguing that mergers were inevitable - if that was the
<br>
original argument, then all of Wei's objections thereto are much
<br>
stronger.
