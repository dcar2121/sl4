<em>&gt; After suggesting in a previous post [1] that AIs who want to cooperate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other may find it more efficient to merge than to trade, I realized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that voluntary mergers do not necessarily preserve Bayesian rationality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is, rationality as defined by standard decision theory. In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two &quot;rational&quot; AIs may find themselves in a situation where they won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntarily merge into a &quot;rational&quot; AI, but can agree merge into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;irrational&quot; one. This seems to suggest that we shouldn't expect AIs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constrained by Bayesian rationality, and that we need an expanded definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what rationality is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think this is on the wrong track. There doesn't seem to be any difference
<br>
between one 'irrational' agent and two agents with one label. e.g. if
<br>
turns-to-paperclips merges with turns-to-staples, and creates an entity that
<br>
is turns-to-paperclips *or* turns-to-staples, if one of these is more likely
<br>
than the others, but is *neither* if this likelihood is known before the
<br>
merger, we have a problem: this entity cannot exist if the odds of success
<br>
for these two goals are known to be different, but if it *does* exist, it
<br>
won't take action until those odds change.
<br>
<p>It looks to me like your AIs with contradictory goals (rather than merely
<br>
orthogonal goals) do not have any good reason to merge, and in addition have
<br>
every reason to be suspicious of one another when presented with a trade.
<br>
<p>I think we might study such AIs by assuming that there are two possible
<br>
relationships between them: war, and temporary cease-fire. Given that a
<br>
merger guarantees zero utility to at least one party, it's probably best
<br>
treated as a very clever kind of attack.
