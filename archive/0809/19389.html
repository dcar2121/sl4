<p>What do you mean &quot;we've removed ourselves from evolution&quot;?
<br>
This is false.
<br>
People sometimes die or become sterile before having children.
<br>
People who do have children, have different numbers of children, and
<br>
start having children at different ages.
<br>
People sometimes go through life without finding a mate.
<br>
Evolution is happening now, and will continue to happen for as long as
<br>
these phenomena continue to occur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the new selective pressures, culture and technology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change so fast that evolution doesn't have a chance to keep up.
</em><br>
<p>The day/night cycle, the tides, and the random forces of weather, all
<br>
have natural timescales much shorter than human evolution. Evolution
<br>
doesn't have to &quot;keep up&quot; for a phenomenon to influence it. The
<br>
question is whether there is any common selective pressure at the
<br>
evolutionary timescale. I think it's very likely - we might be
<br>
selecting for adaptability, for example. Also, other humans have been
<br>
part of the human environment for a long time; parts of the brain
<br>
specializing in dealing with other humans are probably under plenty of
<br>
selective pressure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unless something changes, the future of human &quot;evolution&quot; is by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious searching and designing. Not by the processes of Darwinian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution, which are essentially irrelevant to the debate.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree with your conclusion, merely your reasoning.
<br>
A better line of reasoning would be:
<br>
Human Darwinian evolution is occurring now, but slowly.
<br>
I anticipate human genetic engineering on a large scale (and other
<br>
changes) before ten human generations go by. Therefore, the future of
<br>
human &quot;evolution&quot; is by conscious searching and designing.
