<em>&gt;They also each think they have a good guess of the lock combination, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;assigning a 90% probability of being correct, but their guesses are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different due to having different priors. They have until tomorrow to decide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether to try their guesses or not, but in the mean time they have to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decide whether or not to merge. If they don't merge, they will each try a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guess and expect to get .9*3=2.7 utils, but if they do merge into a new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bayesian AI with an average of their priors, the new AI will assign .45 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probability of each guess being correct, and since the expected utility of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trying a guess is now .45 * 3 &lt; 2, it will decide not to try either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;combination. The original AIs, knowing this, would refuse to merge.
</em><br>
<p>If we assume that
<br>
<p>* both AI's are using &quot;the&quot; Universal Prior or something analogous
<br>
to assign prior probabilities, and
<br>
<p>* both AI's have made the same observations,
<br>
<p>then they can *still* disagree about the prior probabilities.
<br>
The Universal Prior depends on the size of various Turing machines
<br>
that compute the observed past and make a prediction about the future.
<br>
There isn't a unique way to choose the encoding of the Turing
<br>
machines, so the two AI's might have chosen different implementation
<br>
languages for their Turing machines and therefore get different priors
<br>
based on the same observations.
<br>
<p>(Does the encoding of the Turing machines make a difference in the
<br>
limit as the set of past observations gets larger?  I don't know.  I
<br>
hope not.)
<br>
<p>If there is a conflict with large-enough cost when both AI's want to
<br>
attempt to open the safe, then it might be rational for them to merge
<br>
into something that does a coin-flip and based on that uses the priors
<br>
of one of the source AI's rather than an average.
