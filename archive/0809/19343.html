<p>Matt, in your example the individuals are not rational in the Bayesian sense 
<br>
if they each prefer that everyone lives. That's because under Bayesian 
<br>
rationality they are supposed to try to maximize expected utility, which is 
<br>
utility multiplied by probability. Because the probability of everyone 
<br>
living is very low, they shouldn't prefer that everyone lives. Since the 
<br>
topic under discussion is what happens when a group of individually rational 
<br>
AIs merge together, I don't think your example is really relevant.
