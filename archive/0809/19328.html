<p>It's &quot;irrational&quot; in the sense that such an AI can't be modeled by standard 
<br>
decision theory, which is commonly used as a mathematical definition of 
<br>
rationality. I tried to explain why in my post, but maybe didn't get my 
<br>
point across. In standard decision theory, an agent either prefers one state 
<br>
to another, say A and B (i.e., assigns them equal utilities), in which case 
<br>
it also prefers state A to any probabilistic mixture of states A and B, or 
<br>
it is indifferent between A and B, in which case it is also indifferent 
<br>
between all probabilistic mixtures of states A and B. Note that it cannot 
<br>
strictly prefer a probabilistic mixture of A and B to both A and B, which is 
<br>
what is needed to get the &quot;coin flip&quot; behavior from the AI.
<br>
<p>I agree with you that this AI should not be considered irrational, which is 
<br>
why I'm arguing that we need an alternative to standard decision theory.
