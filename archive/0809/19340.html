<p>I haven't made much progress on finding another example that clearly 
<br>
supports my suggestion that the &quot;period of irrationality&quot; might not be 
<br>
short, but one thing that puzzles me here: why 51/49? Why not 52/48, or 
<br>
50.1/49.9? It seems that the original AIs would prefer 50.1/49.9 to 51/49 to 
<br>
52/48, but if they go all the way to 50/50, things fall apart. That seems 
<br>
quite strange.
<br>
<p>I tried doing a literature search to see if there has been any academic 
<br>
research that might apply here, and it turns out that the problems of 
<br>
merging differing priors and utility functions have been noticed by 
<br>
economists in the context of creating an aggregate prior/utility function 
<br>
for purposes of government policy and the like. There are several recent 
<br>
papers on merging priors, which all pointing to a 1955 paper by Harsanyi [1] 
<br>
on the issue of merging utility functions. These works seem to show that 
<br>
merging priors is a worse problem than merging utility functions: whereas 
<br>
merging utility functions can only make some individuals worse off, merging 
<br>
priors can make everyone worse off. This is reflected in my examples as 
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>What Harsanyi showed was that if we assume the following postulates:
<br>
<p>A. Social preferences can be represented by expected utility maximization
<br>
B. Individual preferences can be represented by expected utility 
<br>
maximization
<br>
C. Society is indifference between two outcomes A and B whenever all 
<br>
individuals are indifferent between them
<br>
<p>then the social utility function must be a linear combination of individual 
<br>
utility functions. It apparently wasn't considered that postulate A should 
<br>
be false.
<br>
<p>In [2], the authors show the possibility of merging differing priors, but 
<br>
only by giving up the &quot;Pareto condition&quot; (similar to postulate C above) that 
<br>
when all individuals in society agree on preferences between two 
<br>
alternatives, so should society. Again I didn't see any consideration that 
<br>
perhaps social preferences should not take the form of expected utility 
<br>
maximization.
<br>
<p>I wonder where the assumption came from, that groups as well as individuals 
<br>
should be guided strictly by expected utility maximization? Is it just that 
<br>
no one has proposed a viable and mathematically worked out alternative? I 
<br>
didn't see anything in the literature similar to the &quot;flip a coin&quot; solution 
<br>
that several people have suggested here.
