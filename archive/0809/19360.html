I have  very similar thoughts. I think human intelligence is more like
<br>
music ability than being rational. I have a theory which I'm trying to use
<br>
in webassistants, for example. The  theory just use the basic
<br>
Tonic-SubDominant-Dominant cycle to get a skeleton, on which human-like
<br>
behavior can be built. Classically, one describes his chordprogression as
<br>
&quot;home-getting lost-finding the way home (and going home)&quot;.  A mathematical
<br>
function Y=F(x) is an implicit description of the samething  ((x &quot;home&quot; T)
<br>
(F &quot;want of  solution&quot; SD) (D &quot;using solution&quot;).  The basic idea is that
<br>
since intelligent agents must constantly initiate such cycles (make
<br>
something happen), such a framework must be of (some) value.  This leads to
<br>
thinking of the world as if everything  is intelligent agents/entities (even
<br>
translators in boxes and stones), where the difference between a stone  and
<br>
a human is only a matter of degree (of intelligence). Now its only in the SD
<br>
phase such variation can exist if we want to get some insights which doesnt
<br>
lead to rationalitybased categories. I suspect that most of us agree that
<br>
morality deals with synching &quot;wants of solution&quot;. Also note that Joe and
<br>
Roland may be together a more intelligent entity etc.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Once we have the technology to upload, you will see your dead friends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; appear to come back to life. Since you have nothing to lose, you will invest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in this option, hoping for immortality. The result is a lot of autonomous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agents with human-like goals, but with options not available to us, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the ability to reprogram their brains. Some will directly optimize their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; utility functions or live in simulations with magic genies. They will die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Others will turn off their fear of death. They will also die. Others will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have the goal of replicating themselves or some variation as fast as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible. The copies that fear death and can't change their goals will take
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; over. So we are back where we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   started, with an evolutionary process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fitness function is not fixed.

<p>No it is indeed not. Well, we can abstract over the fitness or the
<br>
competitors at will of course. I dont find that interesting in the context
<br>
of the singularity:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The process towards singularity is likely going to be driven by
<br>
the advantages companies can get (by a greedy search) which will involve
<br>
potential in creative computers (SD). Coupled with a very potent abilty to
<br>
do (D), we may peak right now in being intelligent entities.  Or put in like
<br>
this - the evolution of T-SD-D cycles may uptil now have lead to a higher
<br>
procentage of  happening/cycles where the the SDphase is very dominant. It
<br>
may be that computers is becoming the Dphase in cycle inwhich we are the
<br>
basis for the SDphase right now.
