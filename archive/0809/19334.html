<p>I think the fix isn't so easy. Solutions 1 and 3 don't work in the scenario

I described in my reply to Tim Freeman. Solution 2 doesn't work if the

universe turns out not to be Everettian.

<p><em>&gt; I presume you're localizing the difference to the priors, because if

</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially after Aumann agreement and the presumably large amounts of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There may be another alternative, which is merger into a *non-Bayesian* AI, 
<br>
which somehow has beliefs that causes it to try both combinations. (By 
<br>
&quot;somehow&quot; I'm trying to indicate I don't know how this would work 
<br>
mathematically.) Both of the original AIs would prefer this alternative, if 
<br>
it is feasible.
<br>
<p>In the example I gave, there is no Bayesian AI that both originals would 
<br>
agree to merge into. In real life, as you suggest, differences in pure 
<br>
priors may not be large enough so that there is no Bayesian AI that both 
<br>
originals can agree to merge into. But still, there may be a non-Bayesian AI 
<br>
that both originals would prefer over the Bayesian AIs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't read this whole thread, so I don't know if someone was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; originally arguing that mergers were inevitable - if that was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original argument, then all of Wei's objections thereto are much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stronger.
</em><br>
<p>I did argue that mergers may be inevitable in the original thread, and now 
<br>
realizing that mergers can produce &quot;irrational&quot; AIs, I am arguing that such 
<br>
&quot;irrational&quot; AIs may be inevitable.
