<p><em>&gt; After suggesting in a previous post [1] that AIs who want to cooperate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other may find it more efficient to merge than to trade, I realized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that voluntary mergers do not necessarily preserve Bayesian rationality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is, rationality as defined by standard decision theory. In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two &quot;rational&quot; AIs may find themselves in a situation where they won't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voluntarily merge into a &quot;rational&quot; AI, but can agree merge into an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;irrational&quot; one. This seems to suggest that we shouldn't expect AIs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constrained by Bayesian rationality, and that we need an expanded definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what rationality is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me give a couple of examples to illustrate my point. First consider an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI with the only goal of turning the universe into paperclips, and another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one with the goal of turning the universe into staples. Each AI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to get 1 util if at least 60% of the accessible universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converted into its target item, and 0 utils otherwise. Clearly they can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both reach their goals (assuming their definitions of &quot;accessible universe&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overlap sufficiently), but they are not playing a zero-sum game, since it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible for them to both lose, if for example they start a destructive war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that devastates both of them, or if they just each convert 50% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what should they do? In [1] I suggested that two AIs can create a third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI whose utility function is a linear combination of the utilities of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original AIs, and then hand off their assets to the new AI. But that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work in this case. If they tried this, the new AI will get 1 util if at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least 60% of the universe is converted to paperclips, and 1 util if at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 60% of the universe is converted to staples. In order to maximize its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expected utility, it will pursue the one goal with the highest chance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success (even if it's just slightly higher than the other goal). But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these success probabilities were known before the merger, the AI whose goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a smaller chance of success would have refused to agree to the merger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That AI should only agree if the merger allows it to have a close to 50%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of success according to its original utility function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem here is that standard decision theory does not allow a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilistic mixture of outcomes to have a higher utility than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixture's expected utility, so a 50/50 chance of reaching either of two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals A and B cannot have a higher utility than 100% chance of reaching A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a higher utility than 100% chance of reaching B, but that is what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed in this case in order for both AIs to agree to the merger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;How is an AI which flips a coin and then turns the universe into paperclips
<br>
or staples depending on the result &quot;irrational&quot;? It's certainly odd, but it
<br>
seems rational to me.
