<em>&gt;That's good.  A single &quot;kill all humans&quot; AI is bad enough, but

</em><br>
<p>Yes, as depicted in Philip K Dick's short story &quot;Second Variety&quot;,
<br>
robots so singularly bent on destruction would probably start to
<br>
compete amongst themselves. Notions of social cohesion could too
<br>
easily be bent to the ends of peace.
<br>
<p>I think there is a congruence to the fate of selfish intruders to
<br>
altruistic societies here. Once you've enslaved the workforce and
<br>
monopolized the food supply your labour starts to dwindle. The only
<br>
stable mode appears to be to contribute as much as you consume. Robots
<br>
which only ate people would be totally maladaptive in the event that
<br>
no people were left, unlikely as single-minded machines to be able to
<br>
make the leap in ecological niches to eating other robots.
<br>
<p>In practice the selfish behaviour of viruses and their ilk is kept in
<br>
check by a larger planetary equilibrium. No one organism could ever
<br>
threaten all life on Earth, so presumably the same applies to
<br>
machines. Presumably!
