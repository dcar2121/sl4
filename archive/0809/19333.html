<p>It's not true that the period of &quot;irrationality&quot; (I put it in quotes because 
<br>
it's irrational according to standard decision theory, but not according to 
<br>
common sense) has to be short. Suppose the merged AI starts trying to 
<br>
convert the universe to paperclips based on a coin toss, but after doing 10% 
<br>
of the universe, realizes that the staples goal has a much higher chance of 
<br>
success, which it didn't know at the beginning. I think the two original AIs 
<br>
would have agreed that in this circumstance the merged AI should flip 
<br>
another coin to decide whether or not to switch goals. The coin would be 
<br>
biased, with the probabilities for the two goals linked to their chances of 
<br>
success. This new coin toss would again be considered &quot;irrational&quot; under 
<br>
standard decision theory. Also, just the possibility that the merged AI may 
<br>
have to switch goals in the future will affect everything it does now, so 
<br>
it's likely to deviate from standard decision theory throughout its life.

<p><em>&gt; 2. Even if they were, the sort of negotiation you describe would have

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Thanks, but that isn't exactly the insight I was hoping to deliver. :) I 
<br>
think a merged AI, or a Friendly AI that is supposed to benefit a whole 
<br>
society, may have to somehow embed the negotiation process within itself 
<br>
forever, and there may never be a &quot;return to rationality&quot;.
