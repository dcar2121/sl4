From: &quot;Wei Dai&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:weidai@weidai.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Bayesian%20rationality%20vs.%20voluntary%20mergers">weidai@weidai.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;It's not true that the period of &quot;irrationality&quot; (I put it in quotes because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's irrational according to standard decision theory, but not according to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;common sense) has to be short.
</em><br>
<p>You could be right, but I don't think your example supports your conclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Suppose the merged AI starts trying to convert the universe to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;paperclips based on a coin toss, but after doing 10% of the universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;realizes that the staples goal has a much higher chance of success,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which it didn't know at the beginning. I think the two original AIs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would have agreed that in this circumstance the merged AI should flip
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another coin to decide whether or not to switch goals.
</em><br>
<p>I think the two original AI's would have agreed that the merged AI
<br>
should go for staples without any coin flip, and symmetrically if the
<br>
coin flip had dictated a conversion to paperclips that was later
<br>
discovered to be infeasible.
<br>
<p>So after the coin flip, the utility function for the merged AI might
<br>
be &quot;51 for a universe of 60% staples, or 49 for a universe of 60%
<br>
paperclips, or nothing if I don't get enough staples or enough
<br>
paperclips&quot;.  Swap the numbers if the coin flip comes out the other
<br>
way. 
<br>
<p>I have no intuition at this point -- there might be some other example
<br>
that does support your conclusion, but I can't see it right now, nor
<br>
can I see a path to proving that irrationality from negotiation should
<br>
be short-lived.
