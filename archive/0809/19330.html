From: &quot;Wei Dai&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:weidai@weidai.com?Subject=Re:%20[sl4]%20Bayesian%20rationality%20vs.%20voluntary%20mergers">weidai@weidai.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;The problem here is that standard decision theory does not allow a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probabilistic mixture of outcomes to have a higher utility than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mixture's expected utility, so a 50/50 chance of reaching either of two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goals A and B cannot have a higher utility than 100% chance of reaching A 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and a higher utility than 100% chance of reaching B, but that is what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;needed in this case in order for both AIs to agree to the merger.
</em><br>
<p>For what it's worth, the period of time when the merged AI is acting
<br>
irrationally is very short.  Before it gets all of the assets from A
<br>
and B, it's waiting to get all of the assets.  After it gets all of
<br>
the assets from A and B, it flips the unfair coin and after that point
<br>
it's rational.  So the only period of time when its irrationality is
<br>
observable is when it's choosing to flip the coin and commit to one
<br>
plan or the other based on the result rather than simply pursue the
<br>
plan that is more likely to succeed.
<br>
<p>Everyone knows that political decision making tends to result in
<br>
irrational behavior.  It's good to have a simple model of that, and
<br>
it's good to have an illustration within the model where the return to
<br>
rationality is quick.  In some sense, much of Friendly AI problem
<br>
seems to be to convert the political process of a bunch of humans into
<br>
a rational whole.  We have two issues here:
<br>
<p>1. The humans aren't rational to start with.
<br>
<p>2. Even if they were, the sort of negotiation you describe would have
<br>
to happen at some point, and there's some inevitable irrationality in
<br>
the middle of that.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the insight.
