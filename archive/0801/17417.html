I think that Shulgin and his wife are undoubtedly brave psychonauts and
<br>
should be greatly thanked for their tireless efforts. As well, I don't think
<br>
that there is any question that triptamines, ergotamines, and various other
<br>
neuroactive substances are in some way responsible for our ability to be
<br>
insightful. It is widely accepted that psychedelics can precipitate
<br>
synesthesic states, and must have contributed intrinsically to our sense of
<br>
beauty. I imagine that we would still be unicameral (biblically, please!)
<br>
were it not for drugs, fire, and so language.
<br>
<p>Nootropics are an entirely different kettle of brain-bath goodies, primarily
<br>
intended for optimal function in the present, and perhaps after the results
<br>
of longitudinal studies are tallied, valuable in neuroprotection as we age.
<br>
With computed intelligence we don't have to worry about ageing, as such, but
<br>
must consider instilling psychedelic or, more accurately, standalone
<br>
algorithmic creativity that runs as a complementary process.
