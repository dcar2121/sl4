</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not saying I can answer this, but I can think
<br>
of a couple of analogies which might throw light
<br>
on the shape of a rebuttal.
<br>
<p>Analogy 1: Metazoa. During the Cambrian Explosion
<br>
some 535 million years ago, we see (relatively)
<br>
sudden development of every modern metazoan
<br>
(multi-celled animal) phylum, plus several that
<br>
don't exist now. Previous fauna were odd and
<br>
mostly soft-bodied things, and before that the
<br>
seas were filled with single-celled creatues.
<br>
Suddenly in the Cambrian we have all sorts of
<br>
novelties: legs, gills, shells and claws, eyes,
<br>
you name it. How could nature get complex so
<br>
quickly?
<br>
The real advance was in the software. Eukaryotes
<br>
had learned to live in colonies, and used such
<br>
software as HoX genes to build segmented bodies.
<br>
<em>&gt;From a row of identical simple segments,
</em><br>
specialized segments with arms, ribs, and legs
<br>
are an 'obvious' next step. Many wildly
<br>
diferent-looking beasts may actually have been
<br>
close relatives.
<br>
But now look at us metazoa: we really are largely
<br>
stuck with out basic body plans as originally
<br>
developed half a billion years ago. We can't
<br>
rearrange our organs or grow six extra legs on a
<br>
whim, because the systems are now too complex,
<br>
too interlinked. We've got surviving to do.
<br>
<p>Oh, wait: the situation just changed again: we
<br>
humans, with biotechnology, are no longer forced
<br>
to play the biological hand we were dealt. We've
<br>
developed ways to meddle with biology that no
<br>
creature has ever had. Singularity thinking
<br>
assumes AI with a similar level of power to
<br>
analyze and alter itself, from scratch if need
<br>
be.
<br>
<p>Analogy 2: NASA. This is in answer to a later
<br>
objection in the original E-mail, which I can't
<br>
quote because it got truncated. Rough paraphrase:
<br>
Intelligence is not a single measure of a single
<br>
quantity.
<br>
<p>Consider NASA as if it were an AI. This hive mind
<br>
was created in the late 1950's by joining
<br>
thousands of human brains to achieve a short,
<br>
discrete list of supergoals (Land a man on the
<br>
Moon before the Soviets do; Build satellites and
<br>
landers to investigate other planets and moons;
<br>
Build satellites to view Earth phenomena from
<br>
above; etc.) Each node (human brain) was chosen
<br>
for high performance in the areas of research
<br>
most apppropriate to the supergoals; nodes were
<br>
linked by advanced communications and supplied
<br>
with advanced equipment, and expected to develop
<br>
even more advanced equipment to achieve the
<br>
supergoals. Once the supergoal 'Land men on the
<br>
moon' was achieved, problems developed in the
<br>
hive mind. The superusers (U.S. government and
<br>
taxpayers) issued bad or conflicting new
<br>
supergoals, harming the effectiveness of this AI
<br>
which had proven to be amazingly effective under
<br>
the right conditions. A major successor to the
<br>
Moon landing supergoal was 'Build and fly a
<br>
reusable space plane every two weeks.' This was a
<br>
terrible supergoal: the timetable was
<br>
unachievable, the space plane idea was a sop to
<br>
the Pentagon super-users that was a poor choice
<br>
for the 'Launch satellites supergoal,' and so on.
<br>
Eventually one of the space planes exploded
<br>
because it was flown in cold weather against the
<br>
advice of engineers.
<br>
<p>My point in this tale is that sooner or later,
<br>
the whole complex system yokes together many
<br>
nodes of human-level intelligence, with all their
<br>
various abilitites and talents, and yet needs to
<br>
be able to turn on a dime beause one little node
<br>
(a frantic solid-booster engineer in this case)
<br>
says so. NASA in 1986 fell right on its face
<br>
precisely because of inertia, because the handful
<br>
who knew there was a problem had no power to
<br>
elevate their concerns to near-supergoal status.
<br>
One way to visualize a successful FAI is to
<br>
imagine NASA crammed into a box, and to assume
<br>
that it made fewer mistakes than the real NASA.
<br>
<p>Objection: That sounds hard!
<br>
Rebuttal: Yes, but we have to try anyway.
