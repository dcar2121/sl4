<em>&gt; &gt; Ultimately the only way to discover if the drugs work for real people in

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure I follow. If controlled double-blind clinical trials are
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncontrolled, uncoordinated, inconsistently-reported one-off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments (or, as scientists like to call them, &quot;useless anecdotes&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a more reliable source of data.
</em><br>
<p><p>Here's what I mean. Say the world had never known about the drug &quot;alcohol&quot;.
<br>
Then some people at a pharmaceutical company discovered it and showed that
<br>
it was safe in controlled clinical trials, and could be used for some
<br>
medical purposes (say as a low-grade anaesthetic). They also showed that it
<br>
produced a state called &quot;drunkenness&quot;, associated with mild euphoria and
<br>
disinhibition, which let's for the sake of argument assume is a good thing.
<br>
<p>Now, if the discovery of alcohol happened in modern times, people would be
<br>
very suspicious. They would worry that drinking a lot has bad side effects
<br>
(they'd be right). They'd worry that it kills brain cells (check). They'd
<br>
note that it is habit forming (yup). In the face of all these potential
<br>
hazards, most people would avoid the drug, and so humanity would fail to
<br>
discover that alcohol consumed moderately is basically a good thing. Of
<br>
course, it might still be used to a limited degree for its original purpose.
<br>
You could do a similar thought experiment for coffee.
<br>
<p>So the analogy to the mind-enhancement drugs is as follows. Let's say some
<br>
drug exists (maybe it's known about today) which really improves mental
<br>
function when used moderately, but has some side effects on par with
<br>
alcohol. Because of the side effects, use of the drug is limited to people
<br>
with some deficiency (ADHD, chronic fatigue syndrome) which the drug is
<br>
intended to cure. Thus society at large does not discover the real potential
<br>
of the drug.
<br>
<p>Consider also steroids. People who take steroids achieve unmistakable (and
<br>
often otherwise unobtainable) boosts in athletic performance. Of course,
<br>
there are also bad side effects. But if instead of boosting muscle mass, a
<br>
drug boosted brain function (by a comparable amount) the side effects would
<br>
have to be pretty damn bad to justify NOT using the drug on a wide scale.
<br>
<p>Re: comments by Samantha and Bryan - I'm thinking of drugs along the lines
<br>
of Modafinil and Ritalin, which are currently available by prescription.
<br>
These basically act to increase (deepen) attention, which isn't exactly
<br>
intelligence but is certainly related. I'm not talking about cutting-edge
<br>
experimentation here, that should be left to the labs.
