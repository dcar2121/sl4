<p>Do you apply such strict standards to all reasoning? &quot;Show me the
<br>
Solomonoff Induction or shut up&quot;?
<br>
<p>The complexity of a simulation has implications for how likely it is to
<br>
be run in the first place, but resource requirements are also relevant
<br>
and you're ignoring those.
<br>
<p>My reasoning was that a big simulation is harder to run than a small
<br>
simulation. If a simulation grows bigger, then you're less likely to be
<br>
able to continue to run it. If the people running a simulation only have
<br>
K bits available, then once the simulation requires more than K bits to
<br>
continue running, they have to shut it off.
<br>
<p>Now I don't see this as a reason not to build an FAI, because the FAI
<br>
should be able to do this sort of reasoning better than humans anyway,
<br>
and without needing a ridiculous amount of computing power. It might
<br>
place an upper bound on the size of the singularity, though.
