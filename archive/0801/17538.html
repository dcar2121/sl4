<em>&gt;Most people should realize that they don't have the skills to improve on
</em><br>
past AGI efforts, and should devote their resources to existential risks
<br>
which are easier to understand, such as killer asteroids.
<br>
<p>Peter, overconfidence is indeed an ongoing risk with this venture (as,
<br>
indeed, it is with any venture, especially one that is attempting to build a
<br>
new technology). In general, all things equal, simple solutions should be
<br>
preferred to complex solutions.
<br>
<p>However, the ratio between AGI existential risk and killer-asteroid risk in
<br>
this century has got to be on the order of one to a million!* Despite this,
<br>
I would estimate asteroid-impact overall commands more resources than FAI
<br>
does.** I don't know how much you propose Bayesian shifting for
<br>
overconfidence, but surely it's not a shift of that magnitude.
<br>
<p>Perhaps my own conclusions differs from yours as follows: first of all, I
<br>
have confidence in the abilities of the current FAI community; and second of
<br>
all, if I didn't have confidence, I would try to bring about the creation of
<br>
a new community, or bring about improvements of the existing community,
<br>
rather than abandon FAI for SpaceGuard-type programs.
<br>
<p>-Rolf
<br>
<p>* This risk may go up by some unknown-to-me amount if you consider knock-on
<br>
effects from an otherwise non-existential impact, but I doubt this
<br>
consideration changes my overall analysis.
<br>
<p>** This is a vague statement, I'd be interested if anyone has figures on
<br>
total resources available to SpaceGuard-type programs so that I could pin
<br>
this down better.
