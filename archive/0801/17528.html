<p>
Peter McCluskey brought up the
<br>
concept&lt;<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/protecting-acro.html#comment-98272432">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/protecting-acro.html#comment-98272432</a>&gt;of
<br>
saving resources to invest later in Friendly AI, rather than investing
<br>
resources now. Here are my thoughts on some factors that should go into any
<br>
such a decision.
<br>
<p>* If the resource is money (rather than time), you can invest it in
<br>
financial instruments (tax-free, if you use a donor-directed fund) and, even
<br>
after adjusting for inflation and risk, can end up substantially increasing
<br>
the amount you have to spend.
<br>
<p>* If the resource is donated time and insights, then Peter expressed concern
<br>
that you need to consciously pace yourself to avoid &quot;burning yourself out&quot;.
<br>
I find such burnout a dubious and vague concept, but maybe someone can point
<br>
me to literature that shows this is a real concern.
<br>
<p>* If the FAI community can use the investment to raise its profile and
<br>
attract more resources, this could produce a ROI which would have to be
<br>
weighed against the ROI of financial investments.
<br>
<p>* Crowding: A $1 investment, in 2008 dollars, made in 2018 will likely have
<br>
a lower marginal utility than a $1 investment made in 2008, because in 2018
<br>
more money will likely be spent both on FAI and on irresponsible UFAI
<br>
projects. This is because of economic growth, and also because I believe FAI
<br>
and UFAI are likely to command an increasing percent of GDP in investment
<br>
from year to year. Also, if you condition your probabilities on the
<br>
assumption that investing in FAI is the rational thing for an altruist to do
<br>
in the first place, then you should expect that more people may realize this
<br>
in the future and that FAI investment may be more crowded in the future (and
<br>
thus marginal utility will be lower.)
<br>
<p>* At an extreme, if you leave your money in a will to bequeath some time
<br>
after your death, you will not have the ability to perform oversight on how
<br>
the money is spent; the people spending your money will not be accountable
<br>
to you to spend it effectively and altruistically, and may be corrupted by
<br>
this lack of oversight.
<br>
<p>* There is some unknown timeframe, beyond which investing resources will be
<br>
less useful because it is &quot;too late&quot;; as an extreme case, once the first
<br>
strong AI is built, any money saved up and unspent would be useless in
<br>
determining the outcome. Your estimate of the probability distribution of
<br>
this timeframe should weigh heavily in your decisions.
<br>
<p>* Some set of events must take place before someone can build the first FAI.
<br>
The whole reason for investing your own resources, is based on the concept
<br>
that you will be contributing to one of the events in the causal chain, thus
<br>
making FAI more likely to happen. If I understand him right, Peter brought
<br>
up the possibility that, if you wait, one of these events in the causal
<br>
chain that's a precondition to the event that you're qualified to contribute
<br>
to, might &quot;pop up&quot; while you're waiting. For example, someone else (call him
<br>
Bob) might publish an important and unexpected insight next year, which will
<br>
enable Peter to figure out how to build an FAI, but Peter can't help out
<br>
much this year since Bob hasn't published yet. I agree that this is a valid
<br>
scenario, but it also has to be weighed against the possibility that Peter
<br>
will gain some important insight this year that Bob can use to build an FAI,
<br>
or that Peter will talk Alice into working on FAI this year, and Alice will
<br>
gain an important insight that Bob will need. So I don't see this particular
<br>
concern as significantly affecting the calculus one way or the other, unless
<br>
you have some particular reason to believe that your personal role is going
<br>
to be more important later (or earlier) in the causal chain, compared with
<br>
other peoples' roles.
<br>
