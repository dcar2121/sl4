I think the whole premise of this is a bit messed up because:
<br>
<p>1) We aren't really defining IQ, there are many different IQ tests out
<br>
there and none of them are very accurate at predicting things like
<br>
future income or contributions to society.  If by IQ you mean general
<br>
intelligence, I think you'd need to define it better and I don't
<br>
believe that it could be measured by a single number.
<br>
2) No comprehensive argument that one person of a high IQ is better
<br>
than many people of lower IQs.  While some people think great
<br>
intelligences like Einstein have created huge differences in the
<br>
world, people like Einstein wouldn't be possible if it weren't for
<br>
people who were slightly less intelligent, but who were able to
<br>
understand and apply Einstein's theories.  If Einstein were more
<br>
intelligent, and everybody else less intelligent, then people wouldn't
<br>
understand his idea and they might have even killed him for coming up
<br>
with such heresy as they did with earlier scientists.
<br>
3) The whole situation is contrived, and in my opinion, unlikely to
<br>
occur.  Even if there were some drug that increased intelligence in
<br>
some and decreased it in others, the intelligent thing to do with it
<br>
would be to test the brains (via MRI, EEG etc) of all the people and
<br>
find out what neurological factors caused their intelligence to
<br>
increase or decrease.
<br>
<p>I think that the age of the super scientist who discovers some amazing
<br>
law which revolutionizes the world is over.  Real scientific advances
<br>
will be made by groups.

<em>&gt; &gt; As we get better at directly manipulating human abilities, we're probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to encounter situations in which a treatment has uncertain effects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider a new intelligence enhancement drug that, in clinical trials, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been shown to reduce IQ by 5 points 90% of the time, and raise it by 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points 10% of the time (and can be repeated indefinitely). For an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual, this is a pretty bad deal -- but get a group of 10,000 devoted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularitarians, have each one take the treatment, and then repeat it for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ones who get enhanced, and you'll end up with one person with an IQ 50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points higher. And one ridiculously smart individual may make enough of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to outweigh making 9,000 willing volunteers marginally dumber.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd like to think I would volunteer, if it were the most cost-effective way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to help out. (I can't say whether it's probable that I would actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteer, since (a) I'm not yet taking time to actually think it over since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's hypothetical, and (b) the human brain has an uncanny knack for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalizing its way out of actually following through with making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifices for strangers.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would you like to think that?  On the face of it it is a very poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision.  The likely outcome is that you lose 3.5 IQ points.   Perhaps we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get somone  whose IQ is raised 50 points but of what good is that to you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are hyper IQ folks out there now who aren't working on anything you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think is all that important.  What makes you think that possibly getting one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more such person is worth the real damage to yourself and most others who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; volunteer?   Would you &quot;like to think that&quot; because it makes you a &quot;good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joe&quot; or willing to take one for the group or such?  Why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The rest of the &quot;all too human&quot; reasoning above says that you (and I mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all of us) need all our marbles intact.  :-)
