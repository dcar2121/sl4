<p>
Matt,
<br>
<p>I'll repeat my remark about simulaion arguments in this thread then:
<br>
what exactly does it mean for inhabitants of a world to live in a
<br>
simulation? Simulatedness is not directly observable, only miracles
<br>
are. Question of whether world is simulated is only relevant for
<br>
finding out if miracles can happen.
<br>
<p>I comment on your points below.
<br>

<em>&gt; Evidence (not proof) that the universe is simulated by a finite state machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Turing machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. The universe lacks uncomputable phenomena, such as real-valued states or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite memory computers such as Turing machines.  We lack a non
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilistic model of physics (quantum mechanics).  In a finite state machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, a deterministic model would not be possible because the machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not simulate itself.
</em><br>
<p>If universe had 'uncomputable phenomena', how would you know? How
<br>
would you test for presence of such things? Or equivalently, what does
<br>
it mean for uncomputable phenomena to be present in reality?
<br>
<p>Finite state machine can perfectly well simulate itself, in any
<br>
natural interpretation that comes to mind (you'd have to additionally
<br>
define what it means for this formal construct to have a simulation of
<br>
something).
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2. The universe has finite entropy.  It has finite age T, finite size limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by  the speed of light c, finite mass limited by G, and finite resolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited by Planck's constant h.  Its quantum state can be described in roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (c^5)(T^2)/hG ~ 2^404.6 ~ 10^122 bits.  (By coincidence, if the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided into 10^122 parts, then one bit is the size of the smallest stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle, even though T, c, h, and G do not depend on the properties of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles).
</em><br>
<p>So? If anything, it supports knowability of universe, a counterpart of
<br>
it being simulated from complex unobservable environment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 3. Occam's Razor is observed in practice.  It is predicted by AIXI if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe has a computable probability distribution.
</em><br>
<p>If you could please finally define what you mean by that. Occam's
<br>
razor rule corresponds to good choice of notation/representation,
<br>
which is usually picked to be compressible given distribution of
<br>
described domain. What plays a role of notation in your argument, and
<br>
why does its choice signify anything else?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 4. The simplest algorithm (and by AIXI, the most likely) for modeling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is to enumerate all Turing machines until a universe supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent life is found.  The most efficient way to execute this algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to run each machine with complexity n for 2^n steps.  We observe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of physics (the free parameters in the Standard Model or most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; string  theories, plus general relativity) is on the order of n = a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred bits, which is the log of its entropy.
</em><br>
<p>Complexity is mostly in random content, so I don't see how you move
<br>
from simulation of universe of given complexity to complexity of
<br>
physical laws. Physical laws make up a tiniest part of complexity of
<br>
the world.
