</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is hypothesis 2 exactly as plausible as hypothesis 1? I would say it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much less plausible.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From Eli's Technical Explanation:
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The way human psychology seems to work is that first we see something
<br>
happen, and then we try to argue that it matches whatever hypothesis
<br>
we had in mind beforehand. Rather than conserved probability mass, to
<br>
distribute over advance predictions, we have a feeling of
<br>
compatibility - the degree to which the explanation and the event seem
<br>
to 'fit'. 'Fit' is not conserved. There is no equivalent of the rule
<br>
that probability mass must sum to 1. A psychoanalyst may explain any
<br>
possible behavior of a patient by constructing an appropriate
<br>
structure of 'rationalizations' and 'defenses'; it fits, therefore it
<br>
must be true.
<br>
<p>Now consider the fable told at the start of this essay - the students
<br>
seeing a radiator, and a metal plate next to the radiator. The
<br>
students would never predict in advance that the side of the plate
<br>
near the radiator would be cooler. Yet, seeing the fact, they managed
<br>
to make their explanations 'fit'. They lost their precious chance at
<br>
bewilderment, to realize that their models did not predict the
<br>
phenomenon they observed. They sacrificed their ability to be more
<br>
confused by fiction than by truth. And they did not realize &quot;heat
<br>
induction, blah blah, therefore the near side is cooler&quot; is a vague
<br>
and verbal prediction, spread across an enormously wide range of
<br>
possible values for specific measured temperatures. Applying equations
<br>
of diffusion and equilibrium would give a sharp prediction for
<br>
possible joint values. It might not specify the first values you
<br>
measured, but when you knew a few values you could generate a sharp
<br>
prediction for the rest. The score for the entire experimental outcome
<br>
would be far better than any less precise alternative, especially a
<br>
vague and verbal prediction.
<br>
<p>You now have a technical explanation of the difference between a
<br>
verbal explanation and a technical explanation. It is a technical
<br>
explanation because it enables you to calculate exactly how technical
<br>
an explanation is. Vague hypotheses may be so vague that only a
<br>
superhuman intelligence could calculate exactly how vague. Perhaps a
<br>
sufficiently huge intelligence could extrapolate every possible
<br>
experimental result, and extrapolate every possible verdict of the
<br>
vague guesser for how well the vague hypothesis &quot;fit&quot;, and then
<br>
renormalize the &quot;fit&quot; distribution into a likelihood distribution that
<br>
summed to 1. But in principle one can still calculate exactly how
<br>
vague is a vague hypothesis. The calculation is just not
<br>
computationally tractable, the way that calculating airplane
<br>
trajectories via quantum mechanics is not computationally tractable.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IMO, the simulation argument should not be dismissed.
