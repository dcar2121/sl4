<em>&gt; Our model of the world is one which assigns nonzero probability to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible observations.  One could conceive of a universe where this did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold; that we could model certain events to occur with probability 0 or 1, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same sense that some mathematical statements are absolutely true or false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If we could (correctly) model all observations with certainty, it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof that the universe is not simulated by a Turing machine.  In such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, learning by induction would be suboptimal.
</em><br>
<p>But how would you know that this is the case? Even if you find a law
<br>
that seemingly works all the time, you would still have finite
<br>
confidence in it keeping on, although this confidence will only grow
<br>
with time, to astronomically huge values.
<br>
<p>Even mathematics works only as long as computers or brains that carry
<br>
it out don't fail. If they do, math also stops working. This one is a
<br>
highly counterintuitive point, Eliezer tried to communicate it couple
<br>
of times at Overcoming Bias, and most of commenters don't get it (I
<br>
think it needs better elaboration). It took me some time since his
<br>
first post to figure it out for myself independently. If you copy a
<br>
file to 1000 computers, it doesn't disappear when some of them fail,
<br>
but it does disappear when all of them fail.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The question is whether an observer (a computer) in a universe can model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (predict) the universe (including itself) exactly.  If the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated by a Turing machine, then it is not possible.  A Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state can be described by a map: N -&gt; {0,1}.  There may be more powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines that can model themselves in this sense, for example, R -&gt; {0,1}, N
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -&gt; R, R -&gt; R, (R -&gt; R) -&gt; R, etc.  But because we lack non probabilistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models of the universe, there is no evidence that anything more powerful than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Turing machine is required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You didn't describe a model. Anyway, if the goal is to simulate
<br>
yourself, you can destroy the rest of the universe (so that you'll
<br>
become the only object in the universe), and you'll have enough
<br>
computational resources to simulate this small blob of matter. What
<br>
poses a problem here?
