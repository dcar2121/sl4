<p>
Evidence (not proof) that the universe is simulated by a finite state machine
<br>
or Turing machine.
<br>
<p>1. The universe lacks uncomputable phenomena, such as real-valued states or
<br>
infinite memory computers such as Turing machines.  We lack a non
<br>
probabilistic model of physics (quantum mechanics).  In a finite state machine
<br>
simulation, a deterministic model would not be possible because the machine
<br>
could not simulate itself.
<br>
<p>2. The universe has finite entropy.  It has finite age T, finite size limited
<br>
by  the speed of light c, finite mass limited by G, and finite resolution
<br>
limited by Planck's constant h.  Its quantum state can be described in roughly
<br>
(c^5)(T^2)/hG ~ 2^404.6 ~ 10^122 bits.  (By coincidence, if the universe is
<br>
divided into 10^122 parts, then one bit is the size of the smallest stable
<br>
particle, even though T, c, h, and G do not depend on the properties of any
<br>
particles).
<br>
<p>3. Occam's Razor is observed in practice.  It is predicted by AIXI if the
<br>
universe has a computable probability distribution.
<br>
<p>4. The simplest algorithm (and by AIXI, the most likely) for modeling the
<br>
universe is to enumerate all Turing machines until a universe supporting
<br>
intelligent life is found.  The most efficient way to execute this algorithm
<br>
is to run each machine with complexity n for 2^n steps.  We observe that the
<br>
complexity of physics (the free parameters in the Standard Model or most
<br>
string  theories, plus general relativity) is on the order of n = a few
<br>
hundred bits, which is the log of its entropy.
<br>
<p>If any of these 4 facts did not hold, we would have proof that the universe is
<br>
not simulated by a Turing machine.  (It could still be simulated by a more
<br>
powerful machine, such as a computer with real valued registers).  However, we
<br>
cannot prove the opposite.
