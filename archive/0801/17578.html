<em>&gt; I don't think it makes sense to ask about the Kolmogorov complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent life. The idea of Solomonoff Induction is to ask about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kolmogorov complexity of your theory of everything. 'Intelligent Life'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a high-level phenomenon within the universe.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but if the theory requires intelligent life as a prerequisite,
<br>
the complexity of the theory must be equal to or greater than the
<br>
complexity of intelligent life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's say Alf and Beth are journeying to a foreign land.
</em><br>
<p>This is anthropomorphic reasoning, one step removed. By &quot;foreign
<br>
land&quot;, you're already assuming that whatever place you're going to is
<br>
inhabited by intelligent creatures. The closest real-world analogy to
<br>
the 'foreign land' of other universes is sending spaceships to other
<br>
planets. Any other universes we encounter will be even *more* foreign
<br>
than astronomical bodies, because the laws of physics probably won't
<br>
match.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll have paintings?&quot; Alf asks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Paintings!&quot; says Beth. &quot;Why would you expect to find something so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex? I think we'll find some polynomials, or maybe an exponential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is pretty much what any astronomer would say if you proposed
<br>
finding paintings on Mars, or any other celestial body. In this
<br>
universe, the only math to 'find' is written in the laws of physics,
<br>
and those are the same everywhere. However, we would expect to find
<br>
things with very small K complexities. Rocks. Atmospheres. Volcanoes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alf says, &quot;I think that the universe is probably simple; maybe not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more complex than some polynomials. A painting looks complex if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are only looking at the painting, but if you look at the whole universe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you see that the universe is simple, and the universe contains the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painting.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>We already have one test case where this reasoning has failed
<br>
miserably- SETI. If intelligent life was of low complexity, it would
<br>
have arisen somewhere else within a billion light-years. In another
<br>
universe, it would require even more complexity, because the laws of
<br>
physics would have to be capable of supporting intelligent life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me like you expect your experience of the universe to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close to the fundamental computations of reality, but the most popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory is that you are living inside a simulation in your own head, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine composed of millions of different kinds of molecules. We're so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far from the fundamental computations of reality that it took us 200,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years to find out about quantum mechanics.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but a simulator (by definition) isn't part of our universe. It's
<br>
in another universe entirely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, these are very difficult questions to answer precisely. I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answer them myself. Giving a rigorous mathematical proof/disproof of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; God's existence seems to be very difficult, no matter how you go about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it; if it were easy someone would have done it already. Be aware that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by general societal standards, you are proposing a new religion here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And a solution to the First Cause problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hahaha, is that supposed to scare me?

</em><br>
<p>No, it's supposed to answer any 'unreasonable burden of proof' objections.
