I think what John means is that the perceived values of c, G and h by us are unimportant. The simulation could make them whatever it might wish. The &quot;real&quot; constants that define the simulation are beyond our reach and it is them that define the reality.
<br>
<p>...hmmm look at me talking as if we are in a simulation.
