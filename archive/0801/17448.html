I wrote the following thinking it might be a post for Overcoming  
<br>
Bias.  Instead, I think it's more appropriate for SL4.
<br>
<p>What would you do if something impossible happened?  Not &quot;impossible&quot;  
<br>
like when something unlikely happens and you say &quot;Wow, that was  
<br>
impossible!&quot; but something that has so little chance of happening that  
<br>
it shouldn't happen.  The following story presents one possible  
<br>
scenario.
<br>
<p>Ideally most readers here won't need the epilogue, but I wrote it  
<br>
after I finished the story since I thought someone, especially the  
<br>
average OB reader, might need it.  Comments and suggestions welcome.
<br>
<p><p><p>LEFT SHIFT
<br>
by Gordon Worley
<br>
<p>John shifted one inch to his left.  Naturally, he was surprised since  
<br>
he hadn't meant to, and was sure he hadn't taken a step, been pushed,  
<br>
or otherwise had any expected reason to find himself an inch to the  
<br>
left of where he had been just seconds ago.
<br>
<p>He was standing in the candy aisle of a deserted SuperGas convenience  
<br>
store, looking for something high in sugar and fat to keep him on the  
<br>
road.  Tired, he thought maybe he imagined the spontaneous shift, a  
<br>
product of too many hours staring at an endless stream of white  
<br>
stripes.  But no, that would be lying to himself.  He was sure he had  
<br>
moved one inch to the left.
<br>
<p>He grabbed a candy bar full of carmel and nuts and walked up to the  
<br>
cashier.  She looked like a college student, working nights to pay her  
<br>
way.  At first she didn't notice him because her dark brown hair  
<br>
shielded her eyes as she studied a tabloid article about which  
<br>
celebrities had the best and worst swimsuit bodies of the summer.  He  
<br>
cleared his throat and she looked up.
<br>
<p>&quot;Find everything you need?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; John replied.
<br>
<p>He hesitated for a moment and then said &quot;Did you see what just  
<br>
happened?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Did you see what I just did?  How I spontaneously shifted one inch to  
<br>
the left?&quot;
<br>
<p>Her confusion, and a little fear, showed on her face.  John knew he  
<br>
must sound like a nut job, but she was his only possible witness.
<br>
<p>&quot;No, sorry,&quot; she said.  &quot;I was busy reading.  Did you want to buy that?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said John, having forgotten the candy bar in his left hand.
<br>
<p>&quot;That'll be one oh five.&quot;
<br>
<p>John dug in his right pocket for cash.  He found a crumpled dollar  
<br>
bill quickly, but it took him a few seconds to find a nickel.
<br>
<p>&quot;Here you go,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, not looking up from the register.
<br>
<p>John turned to leave but then stopped.  He knew it was crazy, but he  
<br>
was sure he had shifted one inch to the left.  He turned back to the  
<br>
cashier, who he now noticed had a name tag with &quot;Beth&quot; written on it,  
<br>
and asked &quot;do you have a surveillance system in the store?&quot;
<br>
<p>Her fear growing, she sputtered out a &quot;yes&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;No no, I don't mean it like that.  I don't want to rob the store or  
<br>
anything.  But it's important; do you have one?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, agitation tinging her voice.
<br>
<p>&quot;Can I see the tape of myself standing in the candy aisle?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;No, you can't,&quot; she replied coldly.  &quot;I don't have access to the  
<br>
tapes, and even if I did, I wouldn't show them to you.  Look, I'm sure  
<br>
you think it's funny to mess with a gas clerk, but I'm really not in  
<br>
the mood for it.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.  It's just... I think something  
<br>
impossible just happened to me and I'm very confused and a little  
<br>
scared and I just wanted to see the tape so I could reassure myself  
<br>
that nothing unusually had happened.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Why does it matter,&quot; Beth inquired.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't know, it just does.  Some people like to go through life  
<br>
accepting mystery, but I don't.  I like to know the truth.  I need to  
<br>
know it.  And if I don't find out what really just happened to me, I'm  
<br>
going to spend the rest of my life haunted by the idea that something  
<br>
impossible happened.&quot;
<br>
<p>John could see her softening.  Maybe she was taking pity on him.   
<br>
&quot;Fine,&quot; she said, &quot;I lied.  I do have access to the tapes.  We can  
<br>
watch it in the back office.&quot;
<br>
<p>John breathed a sigh of relief.  &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said.  &quot;I'm John, by the  
<br>
way.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Beth.&quot;
<br>
<p>He started to extend his hand, but his startled her and he pulled his  
<br>
hand back quickly.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sorry, force of habit, I guess.  I shake hands all day at work.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;It's okay, but watch yourself,&quot; she said.  &quot;I've got mace and a  
<br>
taser, so don't try anything funny.&quot;
<br>
<p>John was going to apologize again, but before he could she gave him a  
<br>
&quot;come on&quot; hand motion and walked toward the back of the store.  John  
<br>
followed and they met at the end of the counter.  She led the way,  
<br>
taking him to an unmarked door just past the beer freezer.  She held  
<br>
up a key she must have kept behind the counter and unlocked the door.   
<br>
She opened it, turned on the lights, and didn't look back as she went  
<br>
in.  John caught the door as the spring-loaded hinge swung it shut and  
<br>
followed her in.
<br>
<p>The office wasn't more than a closet with a desk and two chairs.  The  
<br>
desk was covered with a mess of paperwork.  On the corner of the desk  
<br>
was a small TV that was displaying in black and white the surveillance  
<br>
video of the store.  They each took a seat.
<br>
<p>Beth dug through the papers and eventually found a remote.  She aimed  
<br>
it at the TV and rewound the video.  They wanted John walked backwards  
<br>
to the candy aisle, stand there for a while, and then walk backwards  
<br>
out of it.  She hit the play button and John leaned in to make sure he  
<br>
soaked in every detail.
<br>
<p>He only had to wait a few seconds.  Sure enough, at time mark 4:15:86,  
<br>
he could be seen to spontaneously shift one inch to the left.
<br>
<p>&quot;Holy shit!&quot;
<br>
<p>John turned to look at Beth.
<br>
<p>&quot;I didn't really believe you,&quot; she said, &quot;but it actually happened.   
<br>
You were in one spot and then just popped over an inch.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it did,&quot; John said flatly.
<br>
<p>&quot;What?  Why do you seem so troubled?  When I took freshman physics we  
<br>
learned that just this sort of thing can happen.  It's called quantum  
<br>
tunneling, I believe.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said John, &quot;but do you remember what the odds of that happening  
<br>
are?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Sure.  Our teacher said that the chances were small, but that it was  
<br>
an observed effect.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;On the particle level.  The chances of a single particle tunneling  
<br>
are small, but not so small that it never happens.  But a larger  
<br>
object, even something as small as a sugar cube, is made up of so many  
<br>
particles that even if one particle tunnels away the sugar cube  
<br>
appears unaffected.  In order for the entire sugar cube to tunnel,  
<br>
every particle must simultaneously tunnel exactly the same distance in  
<br>
exactly the same direction.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Right, but it's still possible.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Not really.  With millions of particles, such an event is already so  
<br>
unlikely that we may as well say that it will never happen.  The  
<br>
chance of a human tunneling even one inch is so remote that you would  
<br>
sooner expect to win the lottery and then be struck by an asteroid  
<br>
being ridden by a rubber chicken on your way to collect the prize.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yeah, but it could happen.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;You don't get it, do you.  The great 'mystery' of the universe is  
<br>
that not one unusual thing has ever happened...ever!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;So,&quot; said Beth, &quot;I guess that makes what happened to you a miracle.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But miracles don't happen.  At least, they shouldn't.  Not unless...&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Not unless we're living in a simulation.&quot;
<br>
<p>****
<br>
<p>Beth made a copy of the tape and sold it to the local TV station.  The  
<br>
network took interest, and soon the entire country was watching John  
<br>
shift one inch to the left, late at night, in a SuperGas convenience  
<br>
store.  John appeared on national talk shows where he explained what  
<br>
happened.  Soon, he was getting calls from foreign stations asking him  
<br>
for interviews.  Each time he appeared he told the same story, about  
<br>
how something impossible happened.  And each time, when asked why he  
<br>
thought it happened, he explained how it implied that we were living  
<br>
in a simulation.
<br>
<p>Religious groups claimed it was a miracle.  Some scientists admitted  
<br>
it was possible and chalked it up to chance.  Other scientists took it  
<br>
to mean that their theories were wrong and set to work trying to  
<br>
discover a better model for the universe.  And a very few people  
<br>
realized that John was right.
<br>
<p>****
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, at Glork's workstation, an amber light flashed, indicating  
<br>
that Simulation 19,845,658,304 had a bug, causing its inhabitants to  
<br>
realize that they were in a simulation.  Glork sighed.  This would  
<br>
mean the loss of billions of years of computer time, but he had no  
<br>
choice, and flipped the reset switch.
