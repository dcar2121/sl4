</em><br>
<p><p>I think this is an interesting line of thinking, but I'm not sure this
<br>
thought experiment is the best way to formulate the scenario. As others
<br>
pointed out, it's not clear if boosting one single person's IQ while
<br>
lowering everyone else's is a worthwhile trade. Here's a different way of
<br>
asking the question:
<br>
<p>Suppose the Pharma companies come up with a bunch of new supposedly
<br>
mind-enhancing drugs. In clinical trials, the drugs *seem* to boost IQ (or
<br>
other measures of mental performance such as attention) significantly in
<br>
test subjects. But the trials only last a year, and only include a couple
<br>
thousand people, and there are some weird statistically insignificant
<br>
reports of side effects such as bad dreams, hallucinations, etc.
<br>
<p>So clearly there are some risks involved. Maybe you will get smart for a
<br>
couple months, only to go insane afterwards. Maybe you will really get
<br>
smart, but will totally lose your motivation to do anything productive.
<br>
Maybe the drugs only work to cure deficiencies, and so can only help people
<br>
who have those deficiencies to begin with.
<br>
<p>While any *single* drug seems too risky to be worth it, I'm strongly
<br>
inclined to believe that *some* drug in the huge drug-design space would
<br>
improve IQ (or some general mental performance measure). Evolution probably
<br>
gave us a good neurochemical stew to soak our brains in, but it seems
<br>
unlikely that it gave us the best possible stew, especially considering that
<br>
the mental tasks we're interested in doing in the modern world are very
<br>
different from the tasks we had to do in the stone age.
<br>
<p>The question for transhumanists then is: do we start taking the drugs?
<br>
Ultimately the only way to discover if the drugs work for real people in the
<br>
real world is for lots of people to use them. It seems likely that many of
<br>
the early adopters of most of the drugs will hit some nasty side effects.
<br>
But reporting and documenting those side effects will make it possible for
<br>
everyone else to avoid them. And, maybe, after lots of trial and error we'll
<br>
find the Right Stuff Drugs (tm) that really, really make humans smarter with
<br>
negligible side effects. That's a big prize, if we can grab it.
<br>
<p>This question is becoming quite relevant and widely discussed. People are
<br>
starting to take these mind enhancement drugs, though usually in secret. See
<br>
