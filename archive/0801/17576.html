<p>I don't think it makes sense to ask about the Kolmogorov complexity of
<br>
intelligent life. The idea of Solomonoff Induction is to ask about the
<br>
Kolmogorov complexity of your theory of everything. 'Intelligent Life'
<br>
is a high-level phenomenon within the universe.
<br>
<p>Let's say Alf and Beth are journeying to a foreign land. &quot;Do you think
<br>
they'll have paintings?&quot; Alf asks.
<br>
<p>&quot;Paintings!&quot; says Beth. &quot;Why would you expect to find something so
<br>
complex? I think we'll find some polynomials, or maybe an exponential
<br>
function.&quot;
<br>
<p>Alf says, &quot;I think that the universe is probably simple; maybe not very
<br>
much more complex than some polynomials. A painting looks complex if you
<br>
are only looking at the painting, but if you look at the whole universe,
<br>
you see that the universe is simple, and the universe contains the
<br>
painting.&quot;
<br>
<p>It seems to me like you expect your experience of the universe to be
<br>
close to the fundamental computations of reality, but the most popular
<br>
theory is that you are living inside a simulation in your own head, a
<br>
machine composed of millions of different kinds of molecules. We're so
<br>
far from the fundamental computations of reality that it took us 200,000
<br>
years to find out about quantum mechanics.

<p><em>&gt; Yes, these are very difficult questions to answer precisely. I can't

<p>Hahaha, is that supposed to scare me?
