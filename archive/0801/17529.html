</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe, learning by induction would be suboptimal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; with time, to astronomically huge values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even mathematics works only as long as computers or brains that carry

</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly counterintuitive point, Eliezer tried to communicate it couple

</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it needs better elaboration). It took me some time since his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first post to figure it out for myself independently. If you copy a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; file to 1000 computers, it doesn't disappear when some of them fail,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it does disappear when all of them fail.
</em><br>
<p>What I mean is, if we lived in a universe where certain things worked
<br>
perfectly, including our model of it, then that universe would not be Turing
<br>
computable.  It is hard to imagine such a universe because we don't live in
<br>
one.  The fact that we can't imagine it (because a perfect model is
<br>
impossible) is evidence that the universe is Turing computable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The question is whether an observer (a computer) in a universe can model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (predict) the universe (including itself) exactly.  If the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulated by a Turing machine, then it is not possible.  A Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state can be described by a map: N -&gt; {0,1}.  There may be more powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; machines that can model themselves in this sense, for example, R -&gt; {0,1},
</em><br>
<em>&gt; N
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -&gt; R, R -&gt; R, (R -&gt; R) -&gt; R, etc.  But because we lack non probabilistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; models of the universe, there is no evidence that anything more powerful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a Turing machine is required.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You didn't describe a model. Anyway, if the goal is to simulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself, you can destroy the rest of the universe (so that you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become the only object in the universe), and you'll have enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational resources to simulate this small blob of matter. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poses a problem here?
</em><br>
<p>A whole universe simulating itself isn't really a simulation.  But yes, I did
<br>
not fully describe a model, which would include operations on real numbers or
<br>
real valued functions, possibly in discrete or continuous time.  There are
<br>
many such models.  In some of them, it is possible for a universe to model
<br>
itself exactly.  A simple example would be a fractal where each region of
<br>
space is a scaled down copy of a larger region containing it.  Perfect
<br>
fractals are not Turing computable, and do not exist in our universe.
