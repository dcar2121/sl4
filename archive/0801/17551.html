&nbsp;Alternatives to Friendliness
<br>
[edit]
<br>
Couldn't AIs be built as pure advisors, so they wouldn't do anything themselves?
<br>
<p>The problem with this argument is the inherent slowness in all human
<br>
activity - things are much more efficient if you can cut humans out of
<br>
the loop, and the system can carry out decisions and formulate
<br>
objectives on its own. Consider, for instance, two competing
<br>
corporations (or nations), each with their own advisor AI that only
<br>
carries out the missions it is given. Even if the advisor was the one
<br>
collecting all the information for the humans (a dangerous situation
<br>
in itself), the humans would have to spend time making the actual
<br>
decisions of how to have the AI act in response to that information.
<br>
If the competitor had turned over all the control to their own,
<br>
independently acting AI, it could react much faster than the one that
<br>
relied on the humans to give all the assignments. Therefore the
<br>
temptation would be immense to build an AI that could act without
<br>
human intervention.
<br>
<p>Also, there are numerous people who would want an independently acting
<br>
AI, for the simple reason that an AI built only to carry out goals
<br>
given to it by humans could be used for vast harm - while an AI built
<br>
to actually care for humanity could act in humanity's best interests,
<br>
in a neutral and bias-free fashion. Therefore, in either case, the
<br>
motivation to build independently-acting AIs is there, and the cheaper
<br>
computing power becomes, the easier it will be for even small groups
<br>
to build AIs.
<br>
<p>It doesn't matter if an AI's Friendliness could trivially be
<br>
guaranteed by giving it a piece of electronic cheese, if nobody cares
<br>
about Friendliness enough to think about giving it some cheese, or if
<br>
giving the cheese costs too much in terms of what you could achieve
<br>
otherwise. Any procedures which rely on handicapping an AI enough to
<br>
make it powerless also handicap it enough to severely restrict its
<br>
usefulness to most potential funders. Eventually there will be
<br>
somebody who chooses not to handicap their own AI, and then the
<br>
guaranteed-to-be-harmless AI will end up dominated by the more
<br>
powerful AI.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* A human upload would naturally be more Friendly than any AI.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Rebuttal synopsis: just look at the atrocities people with
<br>
unlimited power have committed, and say how Friendly that looks like.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Trying to create a theory which absolutely guarantees Friendly
<br>
AI is too unrealistic / ambitious of a goal; it's a better idea to
<br>
attempt to create a theory of &quot;probably Friendly AI&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Rebuttal synopsis: This is probably true.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* We should work on building a transparent society where no
<br>
illicit AI development can be carried out.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o Rebuttal synopsis: That is a good goal, and worth pursuing
<br>
simultaneously with actual Friendliness development.
