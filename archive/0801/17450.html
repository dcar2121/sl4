To my understanding the odds of this being a simulation are
<br>
overwhelmingly high, so I'd be fascinated to see you expand on this.

Subject: Re: When something impossible happens
<br>
<p>I hate to rain on a story, but given the proposed forum I wanted to
<br>
point out that there are much more more likely explanations than
<br>
suddenly jumping to 'the whole world is fake'.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; LEFT SHIFT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Gordon Worley
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John shifted one inch to his left.  Naturally, he was surprised since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he hadn't meant to, and was sure he hadn't taken a step, been pushed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or otherwise had any expected reason to find himself an inch to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left of where he had been just seconds ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He was standing in the candy aisle of a deserted SuperGas convenience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store, looking for something high in sugar and fat to keep him on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; road.  Tired, he thought maybe he imagined the spontaneous shift, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product of too many hours staring at an endless stream of white 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stripes.  But no, that would be lying to himself.  He was sure he had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moved one inch to the left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He grabbed a candy bar full of carmel and nuts and walked up to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cashier.  She looked like a college student, working nights to pay her
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; way.  At first she didn't notice him because her dark brown hair 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shielded her eyes as she studied a tabloid article about which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; celebrities had the best and worst swimsuit bodies of the summer.  He 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cleared his throat and she looked up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Find everything you need?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; John replied.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He hesitated for a moment and then said &quot;Did you see what just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Did you see what I just did?  How I spontaneously shifted one inch to
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; the left?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Her confusion, and a little fear, showed on her face.  John knew he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must sound like a nut job, but she was his only possible witness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No, sorry,&quot; she said.  &quot;I was busy reading.  Did you want to buy
</em><br>
that?&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said John, having forgotten the candy bar in his left hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;That'll be one oh five.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John dug in his right pocket for cash.  He found a crumpled dollar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bill quickly, but it took him a few seconds to find a nickel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Here you go,&quot; he said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, not looking up from the register.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John turned to leave but then stopped.  He knew it was crazy, but he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was sure he had shifted one inch to the left.  He turned back to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cashier, who he now noticed had a name tag with &quot;Beth&quot; written on it, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and asked &quot;do you have a surveillance system in the store?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Her fear growing, she sputtered out a &quot;yes&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No no, I don't mean it like that.  I don't want to rob the store or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything.  But it's important; do you have one?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; she said, agitation tinging her voice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Can I see the tape of myself standing in the candy aisle?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;No, you can't,&quot; she replied coldly.  &quot;I don't have access to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tapes, and even if I did, I wouldn't show them to you.  Look, I'm sure
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; you think it's funny to mess with a gas clerk, but I'm really not in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mood for it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you.  It's just... I think something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible just happened to me and I'm very confused and a little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scared and I just wanted to see the tape so I could reassure myself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that nothing unusually had happened.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Why does it matter,&quot; Beth inquired.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I don't know, it just does.  Some people like to go through life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accepting mystery, but I don't.  I like to know the truth.  I need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know it.  And if I don't find out what really just happened to me, I'm
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; going to spend the rest of my life haunted by the idea that something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible happened.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John could see her softening.  Maybe she was taking pity on him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Fine,&quot; she said, &quot;I lied.  I do have access to the tapes.  We can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watch it in the back office.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John breathed a sigh of relief.  &quot;Thanks,&quot; he said.  &quot;I'm John, by the
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; way.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Beth.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He started to extend his hand, but his startled her and he pulled his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hand back quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Sorry, force of habit, I guess.  I shake hands all day at work.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It's okay, but watch yourself,&quot; she said.  &quot;I've got mace and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taser, so don't try anything funny.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John was going to apologize again, but before he could she gave him a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;come on&quot; hand motion and walked toward the back of the store.  John 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed and they met at the end of the counter.  She led the way, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking him to an unmarked door just past the beer freezer.  She held 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up a key she must have kept behind the counter and unlocked the door.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She opened it, turned on the lights, and didn't look back as she went 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in.  John caught the door as the spring-loaded hinge swung it shut and
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; followed her in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The office wasn't more than a closet with a desk and two chairs.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desk was covered with a mess of paperwork.  On the corner of the desk 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a small TV that was displaying in black and white the surveillance
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; video of the store.  They each took a seat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beth dug through the papers and eventually found a remote.  She aimed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it at the TV and rewound the video.  They wanted John walked backwards
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; to the candy aisle, stand there for a while, and then walk backwards 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of it.  She hit the play button and John leaned in to make sure he
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; soaked in every detail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He only had to wait a few seconds.  Sure enough, at time mark 4:15:86,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; he could be seen to spontaneously shift one inch to the left.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Holy shit!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John turned to look at Beth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I didn't really believe you,&quot; she said, &quot;but it actually happened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You were in one spot and then just popped over an inch.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yeah, it did,&quot; John said flatly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What?  Why do you seem so troubled?  When I took freshman physics we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learned that just this sort of thing can happen.  It's called quantum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tunneling, I believe.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; said John, &quot;but do you remember what the odds of that happening
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; are?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Sure.  Our teacher said that the chances were small, but that it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an observed effect.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;On the particle level.  The chances of a single particle tunneling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are small, but not so small that it never happens.  But a larger 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; object, even something as small as a sugar cube, is made up of so many
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; particles that even if one particle tunnels away the sugar cube 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears unaffected.  In order for the entire sugar cube to tunnel, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every particle must simultaneously tunnel exactly the same distance in
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; exactly the same direction.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Right, but it's still possible.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Not really.  With millions of particles, such an event is already so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely that we may as well say that it will never happen.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of a human tunneling even one inch is so remote that you would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sooner expect to win the lottery and then be struck by an asteroid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being ridden by a rubber chicken on your way to collect the prize.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yeah, but it could happen.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;You don't get it, do you.  The great 'mystery' of the universe is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that not one unusual thing has ever happened...ever!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;So,&quot; said Beth, &quot;I guess that makes what happened to you a miracle.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;But miracles don't happen.  At least, they shouldn't.  Not unless...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Not unless we're living in a simulation.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ****
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Beth made a copy of the tape and sold it to the local TV station.  The
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; network took interest, and soon the entire country was watching John 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shift one inch to the left, late at night, in a SuperGas convenience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store.  John appeared on national talk shows where he explained what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened.  Soon, he was getting calls from foreign stations asking him
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; for interviews.  Each time he appeared he told the same story, about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how something impossible happened.  And each time, when asked why he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought it happened, he explained how it implied that we were living 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religious groups claimed it was a miracle.  Some scientists admitted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was possible and chalked it up to chance.  Other scientists took it
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; to mean that their theories were wrong and set to work trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover a better model for the universe.  And a very few people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realized that John was right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ****
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, at Glork's workstation, an amber light flashed, indicating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Simulation 19,845,658,304 had a bug, causing its inhabitants to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realize that they were in a simulation.  Glork sighed.  This would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean the loss of billions of years of computer time, but he had no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice, and flipped the reset switch.
