<p>
Tom and Kaj,
<br>
<p>Thanks for this effort, and I look forward to seeing this online. Be sure to
<br>
do copy-editing first, though, for style and brevity.
<br>
<p>Some comments:
<br>
<p>* SIAI will just putz around and never actually finish the project, like all
<br>
<em>&gt; the other wild-eyed dreamers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  o This, I think, is a real, serious risk. - Tom
</em><br>
<p><p>The SIAI needs hard-headed business-like management alongside the wild-eyed
<br>
dreaming.  Tyler with the team has made good progress -- more is needed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; * There's no idea in treating seriously an institution whose leader and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only full-time researcher is a middle-school drop-out without a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peer-reviewed publication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
o Incidentally, this might be one of the rare objections that it's better to
<br>
<em>&gt; just quietly ignore than try to answer...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Of course, you can't just ignore an objection, if it means the SIAI will get
<br>
suffer in various ways like not getting donations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't know if any answer will satisfy those who only look for formal
</em><br>
credentials before
<br>
<em>&gt; respecting someone, and there's no point in highlighting the issue. - Kaj
</em><br>
<p>I very much respect Eliezer (and donate to SIAI), but that's because I read
<br>
hundreds of pages of his and other's writings. You can't expect all
<br>
potential supporters to do that.
<br>
<p>If I heard of an innovative but off-beat cancer research institute whose
<br>
lead researcher is a middle-school drop-out with no peer-reviewed
<br>
publications, I wouldn't have the time or ability to compare his approach
<br>
against with more mainstream and credentialed scientists. I'd prefer to
<br>
direct my donations to the latter, and I'd be right to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; those two chapters for Global Catastrophic Risks, which were technically
</em><br>
peer-reviewed,
<br>
In academia, book chapters are considered to be at a lower level of prestige
<br>
in terms of peer review.
<br>
<p>SIAI has addressed the issue of credentials by adding Ben Goertzel and other
<br>
PhD's to its team. A further step might be to publish SIAI-funded work in
<br>
peer-reviewed journals.
<br>
<p>The scientific community demands that researchers pump out articles for a
<br>
reason -- it is a metric of performance; not a good one, but one of the few
<br>
we have. I am not suggesting that Eliezer pumps out low-quality work, but I
<br>
am suggesting that we treat the mainstream &quot;establishment&quot; scientific
<br>
process with respect and see if SIAI can (partially) fit into it.
<br>
<p>Joshua
