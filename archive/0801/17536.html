<em>&gt;* If the resource is donated time and insights, then Peter expressed concern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you need to consciously pace yourself to avoid &quot;burning yourself out&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I find such burnout a dubious and vague concept, but maybe someone can point
</em><br>
<em>&gt;me to literature that shows this is a real concern.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't know much about literature on burnout, but there's a good deal
<br>
of literature on &quot;learned helplessness&quot; which partly describes what I
<br>
have in mind. &quot;Consciously pace yourself&quot; isn't quite the prescription
<br>
I had in mind. Most efforts at doing something constructive about AGI have
<br>
so far been a waste of time. Most people should realize that they don't
<br>
have the skills to improve on past AGI efforts, and should devote their
<br>
resources to existential risks which are easier to understand, such as
<br>
killer asteroids. My estimate of my ability suggests that if I spend a
<br>
few years obsessed with trying to design an FAI and/or reading every AI
<br>
related literature that has a tiny chance of providing FAI-related insights,
<br>
I will almost certainly realize that that effort has been wasted, and
<br>
become too frustrated to put much further effort into watching for people
<br>
who have the ability to build an FAI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;* If the FAI community can use the investment to raise its profile and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attract more resources, this could produce a ROI which would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weighed against the ROI of financial investments.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Is there an FAI community in the sense that would be relevant to producing
<br>
a useful ROI? There's certainly a group of people who want to create an FAI.
<br>
But I don't see a community that has the skills to make progress toward FAI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;* Crowding: A $1 investment, in 2008 dollars, made in 2018 will likely have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a lower marginal utility than a $1 investment made in 2008, because in 2018
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This depends on assumptions about the marginal utility of investing $1
<br>
in 2008 which I suspect reflect overconfidence. Most money invested on AGI
<br>
in 2008 will be wasted due to lack of knowledge about how to usefully
<br>
invest it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;to, might &quot;pop up&quot; while you're waiting. For example, someone else (call him
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Bob) might publish an important and unexpected insight next year, which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enable Peter to figure out how to build an FAI, but Peter can't help out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;much this year since Bob hasn't published yet. I agree that this is a valid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scenario, but it also has to be weighed against the possibility that Peter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will gain some important insight this year that Bob can use to build an FAI,
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I think it's much more likely that I will someday recognize and provide
<br>
resources to a person who will do something constructive about FAI with
<br>
those resources, than that I will provide anyone with important insights
<br>
about how to build an FAI or that I will figure out how to build an FAI.
<br>
I haven't yet recognized such a person.
<br>
&nbsp;You shouldn't assume that the same analysis applies to you. Most people
<br>
ought to stick to easier things like helping to detect killer asteroids.
<br>
But if you're on this mailing list, you're probably either too overconfident
<br>
in your abilities to heed that advice, or you have some skill which is
<br>
sufficiently unusual that I can't easily give you advice on how to use it.
