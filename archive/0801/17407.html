<p>Prediction and intelligence go hand-in-hand, so how is a number (IQ)

supposed to be at all intelligent?

<p>Again, this is SL4, and I sincerely doubt you're going to get many

people here to redefine &quot;general intelligence.&quot; I have been attempting 
<br>
to purge the word 'intelligence' from my daily vocabulary, but it's 
<br>
just so darn tempting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; don't believe that it could be measured by a single number.
</em><br>
<p>On another note, the <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/">http://www.orionsarm.com/</a> group measures 
<br>
intelligence on a numerical scale. I wonder if there's ever going to be 
<br>
a change there, too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) No comprehensive argument that one person of a high IQ is better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than many people of lower IQs.  While some people think great
</em><br>
<p>See the previous posts on effective sagacity and making the singularity 
<br>
happen by overcoming procrastination. But this is a simple, MPD-like 
<br>
theory (think pop-psych, multiple personality disorders, etc.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; intelligences like Einstein have created huge differences in the

<p>It's convenient to attribute intelligence to Einstein, but what about 
<br>
knowledge or his daily routine? There's so much that he left unrecorded 
<br>
about himself that it's all too easy to say it's intelligence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; world, people like Einstein wouldn't be possible if it weren't for
</em><br>

<p>Einstein would still be Einstein even without John Does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; understand and apply Einstein's theories.  If Einstein were more

</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't understand his idea and they might have even killed him for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming up with such heresy as they did with earlier scientists.
</em><br>
<p>So he wasn't smart enough to not get killed, then.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) The whole situation is contrived, and in my opinion, unlikely to

<p>There are some nootropics out there that do this ... sort of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; some and decreased it in others, the intelligent thing to do with it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Different people, different brains. Neurodiversity etc. But I wouldn't 
<br>
be opposed to fMRI nootropic studies and so on. As long as they aren't 
<br>
about IQ tests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; find out what neurological factors caused their intelligence to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase or decrease.
</em><br>
<p>But then you run into problems defining intelligence and measurements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that the age of the super scientist who discovers some
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Bullshit. Superscientists ahoy!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; advances will be made by groups.

<p>&quot;Never underestimate the ability of a small group of thoughtful, 
<br>
dedicated individuals to change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing

that ever has.&quot; - Margaret Mead
