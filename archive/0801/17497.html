</em><br>
<p>Again: how would you test that?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; Finite state machine can perfectly well simulate itself, in any

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A finite state machine with n states cannot model a machine with more than n
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states.
</em><br>
<p>Not every machine, but who needs that? And again, what do you mean by modeling?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. The universe has finite entropy.  It has finite age T, finite size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; by  the speed of light c, finite mass limited by G, and finite resolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; limited by Planck's constant h.  Its quantum state can be described in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; (c^5)(T^2)/hG ~ 2^404.6 ~ 10^122 bits.  (By coincidence, if the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; divided into 10^122 parts, then one bit is the size of the smallest stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; particle, even though T, c, h, and G do not depend on the properties of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; particles).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So? If anything, it supports knowability of universe, a counterpart of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it being simulated from complex unobservable environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that is my point.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I meant 'counterpart' as in 'opposite'. Problem with simulated
<br>
worlds is (supposedly) that complex unpredicatable miracles can
<br>
happen. If everything is simple and observable, what is the problem?
<br>
'Simulatedness' is not observable and in itself is a meaningless
<br>
category.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Occam's Razor is observed in practice.  It is predicted by AIXI if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; universe has a computable probability distribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If you could please finally define what you mean by that. Occam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; razor rule corresponds to good choice of notation/representation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which is usually picked to be compressible given distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; described domain. What plays a role of notation in your argument, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why does its choice signify anything else?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hutter proved that the optimal behavior of a reward seeking agent in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unknown environment simulated by a pair of interacting Turing machines is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess at each step that the environment is simulated by the shortest program
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent with observation so far.  Occam's Razor is an example of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy.  The proof is valid only for the case where the environment has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computable probability distribution.  Of course this is not a proof that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment is simulated, but if Occam's Razor did not work in practice, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be strong evidence that the universe is not simulated.
</em><br>
<p>How would you test if your notion of Occam's razor didn't work?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. The simplest algorithm (and by AIXI, the most likely) for modeling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; universe is to enumerate all Turing machines until a universe supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent life is found.  The most efficient way to execute this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is to run each machine with complexity n for 2^n steps.  We observe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; complexity of physics (the free parameters in the Standard Model or most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; string  theories, plus general relativity) is on the order of n = a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; hundred bits, which is the log of its entropy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Complexity is mostly in random content, so I don't see how you move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from simulation of universe of given complexity to complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physical laws. Physical laws make up a tiniest part of complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fastest way to find a universe supporting intelligent life is run the k'th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe for k steps.  I claim that for our universe, k ~ 10^122.
</em><br>
<p>But how does it relate to complexity of laws of physics which are much simpler?
