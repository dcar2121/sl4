<em>&gt; Do you apply such strict standards to all reasoning? &quot;Show me the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Solomonoff Induction or shut up&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>All reasoning which deals with nontestable theories and nonobservable
<br>
entities, yes. This is the same standard of proof I would require for,
<br>
eg., deism. This goes double when we're dealing with the fate of
<br>
humanity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The complexity of a simulation has implications for how likely it is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be run in the first place, but resource requirements are also relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you're ignoring those.
</em><br>
<p>Solomonoff induction ignores &quot;resource requirements&quot; in the
<br>
conventional sense. In Turing-machine land, the only limiting resource
<br>
is number of computational steps, which we don't care about because we
<br>
never see them directly. If it took a googol steps to move through one
<br>
nanosecond, we'd never know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My reasoning was that a big simulation is harder to run than a small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation. If a simulation grows bigger, then you're less likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to continue to run it. If the people running a simulation only have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; K bits available, then once the simulation requires more than K bits to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue running, they have to shut it off.
</em><br>
<p>People running the simulation? As in, intelligent thinkers? That's a
<br>
heck of a lot more complicated, and therefore much more unlikely, than
<br>
assuming the simulation is governed by a simple set of Turing-style
<br>
computational rules.
<br>
<p>If we assume an atom-by-atom simulation, the computer doesn't care in
<br>
what order the atoms are arranged, they still require the same number
<br>
of bits to represent their quantum states. If we assume that only the
<br>
humans are simulated atom-by-atom and everything else is cheaply
<br>
computed (unless we look at it), that's a whole bunch of additional
<br>
complexity which needs to be taken into account.
<br>
<p>It doesn't require very much additional complexity before we can
<br>
safely ignore the possibility. If the set of rules saying &quot;we get
<br>
killed&quot; is fifty bits longer (in Kolmogorov terms) than the set of
<br>
rules saying &quot;we don't get killed&quot;, the odds are around
<br>
1,000,000,000,000,000:1 against. Considering that the chance of us
<br>
getting killed by a programming error is probably more like 10%, we
<br>
really should require a rigorous (or at least semi-rigorous) argument
<br>
before we divert resources.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I don't see this as a reason not to build an FAI, because the FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be able to do this sort of reasoning better than humans anyway,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and without needing a ridiculous amount of computing power. It might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place an upper bound on the size of the singularity, though.
