<p>You can imagine two versions of the simulation argument. The weak version is
<br>
that the universe is simulated on a computer with effectively infinite
<br>
computational power. In that case, there is no way to determine that we are
<br>
in a simulation, because the simulation is perfect.
<br>
<p>The strong version is that the computer running the simulation has (vast,
<br>
but) limited computing power. Because of this the designers need to &quot;cheat&quot;
<br>
by introducing computational shortcuts. Several of the laws of physics can
<br>
be seen as reflections of this principle:
<br>
<p>1) Nature does not solve NP-hard problems.
<br>
<p>2) The central mystery of quantum mechanics, as revealed by the double-slit
<br>
experiment, can be seen as a computational shortcut: the simulation notices
<br>
that the path of the electron does not affect anything on a &quot;macroscopic&quot;
<br>
scale, so it doesn't bother to compute the real trajectory.
<br>
<p>3) The speed of light can be seen as a result of running a simulation on
<br>
many machines: due to communication limits on the machines, there must be a
<br>
limit to how rapidly an event in one machine influences an event on a
<br>
faraway machine.
<br>
<p>4) Conservation of energy can be interpreted as conservation of code length,
<br>
due to the similarity between the Boltzmann factor and the Shannon optimal
<br>
codelength rule.
<br>
<p>5) Fermi's paradox can be interpreted as implying that only the Earth is
<br>
being simulated with high accuracy; in other regions the simulation is
<br>
taking too many computational shortcuts for life to exist.
<br>
<p>This strong version of the simulation argument suggests new physical
<br>
experiments. For example, there should be a point at which the simulation
<br>
decides an effect is simply too far away to matter (e.g. the influence of
<br>
Pluto on the Earth's gravitational field). This kind of thing should be
<br>
testable with high-precision experiments.
<br>
<p>Just put yourself in the shoes of a simulation designer: you want to make it
<br>
look &quot;real&quot; to the life forms, but you have limited computing power. What
<br>
kinds of tricks do you use?
