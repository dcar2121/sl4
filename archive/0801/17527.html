<p>I don't pretend to fully understand this, but see Scott Aaronson
<br>
&quot;NP-Complete Problems and Physical Reality&quot;. Aaronson claims that the fact
<br>
that nature does not solve NP-hard problems should be considered as a new
<br>
physical law.
<br>
<p>We can't assume that concepts like distance, time, and velocity
<br>
<em>&gt; have any meaning in the simulating universe.
</em><br>
<p><p>That may be true. If there is no notion of time in the simulating universe,
<br>
it's hard to talk about notions such as computational power (can one define
<br>
computational power without appealing to the concept of time...?)

<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 4) Conservation of energy can be interpreted as conservation of code
</em><br>
<em>&gt; length,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; due to the similarity between the Boltzmann factor and the Shannon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; codelength rule.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conservation of mass/energy limits the size of the universe.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you suggest between thermodynamic and information theoretic entropy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrelated to energy.  It is related to the direction of time.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irreversibly loses information, so its uncertainty about its environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases.
</em><br>
<p><p>This is what I mean. Consider a system of interacting particles with various
<br>
energy states. The probability that a particle is in a given energy state
<br>
is:
<br>
<p>p(E)=exp{-E/kT}/Z
<br>
<p>Assuming the simulation encodes the state of the particles using an optimal
<br>
code, the code length requirement is:
<br>
<p>-log P(E) = E/kT + log(Z)
<br>
<p>The 1/kT factor is shared by all the particles in the system, and the log(Z)
<br>
term does not change with changes in the particle's energy state. Thus an
<br>
interchange of energy between any two particles will result in zero net code
<br>
length difference.
<br>
<p>The strong version would require high algorithmic complexity in the laws of
<br>
<em>&gt; physics, which we don't observe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm suggesting that if, motivated by the strong version of the simulation
<br>
argument, we looked harder for &quot;glitches&quot; in the simulation we might find
<br>
some. In other words, the simulation would actually have high algorithmic
<br>
complexity, because of computational limitations of the simulating
<br>
machine(s), but appears to have low algorithmic complexity.
