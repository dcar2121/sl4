&quot;Ability to foster a singularity blocked or limited&quot;
<br>
We (humans) are a Singularity/AI created by another intelligence for
<br>
some reason.  As a part of our creation something was set to
<br>
explicitly limit to our ability to improve ourselves or our creations
<br>
for some unknown reason.  Thus blocking our ability to create our own
<br>
concept of a Singularity.
<br>
<p>&quot;Resource limitation inherited from creators systems&quot;
<br>
The universe we live in could be the computer (or whatever we want to
<br>
call it) that we as a created AI/Singularity run in/on, and its not
<br>
capable of handling (running) our imagined Singularity.

Tom is this the kind of thing you were looking for or is it too far fetched?

&gt; From Kaj Sotala:
&gt;
&gt; &quot;For the recent week, I have together with Tom McCabe been collecting
&gt; all sorts of objections that have been raised against the concepts of
&gt; AGI, the Singularity, Friendliness, and anything else relating to
&gt; SIAI's work. We've managed to get a bunch of them together, so it
&gt; seemed like the next stage would be to publicly ask people for any
&gt; objections we may have missed.
&gt;
&gt; The objections we've gathered so far are listed below. If you know of
&gt; any objection related to these topics that you've seriously
&gt; considered, or have heard people bring up, please mention it if it's
&gt; not in this list, no matter how silly it might seem to you now. (If
&gt; you're not sure of whether the objection falls under the ones already
&gt; covered, send it anyway, just to be sure.) You can send your
&gt; objections to the list or to me directly. Thank you in advance for
&gt; everybody who replies.&quot;
&gt;
&gt; I'll be posting the objections we've gathered, and possible responses,
&gt; to SL4. This is a work in progress; please send any suggestions for
&gt; improvement to the list, or send them to me and Kaj directly.
&gt;
