While you can't prove a negative, the universe certainly could be a 
<br>
simulation, I'd say the following:
<br>
<p>The universe behaves like a finite state machine because it has state and
<br>
its finite. The fun thing about finite state machines, there are certain 
<br>
rules that hold irregardless of the program being executed. The simple 
<br>
fact that your operating on a finite number of bits in progress time 
<br>
slices by itself ends up implying quite a bit. For example unless bits 
<br>
are added (from where?), the universal state machine will eventually 
<br>
repeat in 2^N steps or less where N is the number of bits the universe 
<br>
holds.
<br>
<p>I tend to think what we see as randomness and probability in quantum
<br>
mechanics is due to the fact that we cannot possible know the
<br>
entanglements a particle has. The universe at the lowest
<br>
level is deterministic, but only on the scale of the entire universe.
<br>
Any given quantum system is coupled to the outside world in ways we
<br>
cannot know due to its history, and thus appears random. A thought
<br>
experiment to prove that entanglement leads to uncertainty.
<br>
<p>A and B independantly measure the spin directions of electrons of
<br>
unknown history. This means that A &amp; Bs electrons (call them Ae &amp; Be) may
<br>
be entangled in any possible way. It may be that Ae spin up implies Be
<br>
spin down, or it may be that Ae spin up implies Be spin up, or any other
<br>
possible entanglement. Observer A measures spin up, and because the 
<br>
entanglement history is unknown and cannot be known, B cannot possibly 
<br>
know in advance what the spin of direction of Be is. Unknown entanglement
<br>
histories force local non-determinism, however interestingly they do not
<br>
force global non-determinism.
<br>
<p>The philosophical implications of a deterministic universe are
<br>
interesting. It might well be a fractal being executed which contains
<br>
essentially no information at all other than pseudo-random results.

<em>&gt; 1. The universe lacks uncomputable phenomena, such as real-valued states or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite memory computers such as Turing machines.  We lack a non
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probabilistic model of physics (quantum mechanics).  In a finite state machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation, a deterministic model would not be possible because the machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could not simulate itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. The universe has finite entropy.  It has finite age T, finite size limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by  the speed of light c, finite mass limited by G, and finite resolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited by Planck's constant h.  Its quantum state can be described in roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (c^5)(T^2)/hG ~ 2^404.6 ~ 10^122 bits.  (By coincidence, if the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; divided into 10^122 parts, then one bit is the size of the smallest stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particle, even though T, c, h, and G do not depend on the properties of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particles).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. Occam's Razor is observed in practice.  It is predicted by AIXI if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe has a computable probability distribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. The simplest algorithm (and by AIXI, the most likely) for modeling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is to enumerate all Turing machines until a universe supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent life is found.  The most efficient way to execute this algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is to run each machine with complexity n for 2^n steps.  We observe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity of physics (the free parameters in the Standard Model or most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; string  theories, plus general relativity) is on the order of n = a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred bits, which is the log of its entropy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If any of these 4 facts did not hold, we would have proof that the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not simulated by a Turing machine.  (It could still be simulated by a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful machine, such as a computer with real valued registers).  However, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot prove the opposite.
