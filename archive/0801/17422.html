Here's my take coming from &quot;main-stream&quot; cognitive/clinical psychology  
<br>
and neuroscience.  In a nutshell, legal drugs–you won't be exhibiting  
<br>
very much intelligence if you get arrested–can be useful for a  
<br>
singulatarian when used in moderation.  However, I don't think drugs  
<br>
will be responsible for producing super-intelligent people that will  
<br>
be capable of bringing on the singularity.  We're going to need to  
<br>
rely on old-fashioned science and elbow-grease for that one.  Please  
<br>
correct me if I get anything wrong:
<br>
<p>Stimulants:  There is a distribution of configurations for various  
<br>
cognitive functions.  Some people have much greater attentional  
<br>
abilities than others.  Some people have larger working memories than  
<br>
others.  At the extremes, such as in experiments comparing people  
<br>
diagnosed with ADHD and non-ADHD controls, you can identify  
<br>
differences in brain function/morphology in regions that you would  
<br>
expect to show differences (e.g. frontal cortex).  Mind you, these  
<br>
brain differences cannot be used for predictive/diagnostic purposes,  
<br>
but they'll give you reliable group differences in controlled  
<br>
studies.  ADHD-type deficiencies can largely be overcome by giving  
<br>
patients drugs that increase the availability of dopamine/ 
<br>
norepinephrine in the frontal cortex.  However, the effectiveness of  
<br>
these drugs decreases over time and the effects are greatly reduced  
<br>
after ~3-years.  This is probably due to a combination of factors  
<br>
including down-regulation of dopamine/norepinephrine receptors:  in  
<br>
order to maintain homeostasis, neurons tend to undergo changes that  
<br>
prevent hyper/hypo-activity.  I don't think many studies have been  
<br>
done on the long term effects of the drugs in non-ADHD diagnosed  
<br>
individuals, but among the studies that have been done, stimulants  
<br>
increase performance on IQ/cognitive tests.  However, it seems like a  
<br>
bad idea to become reliant on stimulant drugs for two reasons: 1)  
<br>
eventually the effectiveness will fade as your brain down-regulates  
<br>
receptors; then you're just stuck with the negative side-effects like  
<br>
increased heart-rate; 2) you become dependent on neural networks that  
<br>
are dependent upon a certain level of the drug for optimal  
<br>
functioning; if you go off of the drug, you are likely to experience  
<br>
some degree of impairment.  Thus, while stimulant drugs may be useful  
<br>
on a short-term basis, they are not a viable solution for long term  
<br>
intelligence enhancement.
<br>
<p>Depressants:  Some drugs tend to decrease cognitive function and are  
<br>
used in order to create the pleasant effect of relaxation.  Moderate  
<br>
use of these has not shown reliable differences in tests of cognitive  
<br>
functions when tested on longer time-scales.  With Cannabis–which  
<br>
isn't quite a depressant–there are some short term effects in terms of  
<br>
reduced performance.  In terms of positive performance, these drugs  
<br>
may help to facilitate creativity by reducing inhibitions.  They can  
<br>
act as mental laxatives.  Depressants may also be valuable in treating  
<br>
episodes of acute stress.  Chronically elevated stress levels tend to  
<br>
lead to memory impairments and overall poor health.  If your health  
<br>
goes to crap, it becomes more difficult to display intelligence.   
<br>
Unfortunately, we also seem to develop adaptations to depressants over  
<br>
time, such that a given dose is no longer sufficient for inducing  
<br>
relaxation.  So you can get dependence and then you have all of the  
<br>
nasty side-effects with reduced treatment effects.
<br>
<p>Psychedelics:  These drugs tend to act on the serotonin system in  
<br>
whacky ways.  When using these drugs, individuals may make disparate  
<br>
associations that they would have usually dismissed.  The majority of  
<br>
these associations are going to be spurious, but occasionally one may  
<br>
strike gold.  Most likely, the gold will not be a solution to a  
<br>
technical problem but some sort of personal realization.  Hence you  
<br>
hear about a lot of famous artists using drugs, but not as many  
<br>
scientists.  Among scientists who do use drugs, there is no evidence  
<br>
that the drugs contributed to their creativity.  They may have been  
<br>
intellectually adventurous and that's why they explored drugs in the  
<br>
first place.  Considering the low hit-rate, you'd probably get greater  
<br>
insights from reading books during the time you'd spend high.
<br>
<p>Exercise/Yoga/Meditation:  Through mental training, it may be possible  
<br>
to achieve many of the desired effects of drugs, but in more  
<br>
sustainable ways.  This is still an emerging science, but some of the  
<br>
initial results look promising.  Most forms of meditation seem to be  
<br>
good for stress relief.  While less certain, meditation may be capable  
<br>
of increasing cognitive control and attention.  Interesting results by  
<br>
Sarah Lazar have shown that long term meditators have increased  
<br>
cortical thickness in frontal cortical regions associated with  
<br>
attention.  Further evidence may bear out behavioral differences in  
<br>
age-related cognitive decline.  There is already good evidence that  
<br>
regular exercise has neuroprotective effects.  Best of all, meditation  
<br>
is easy on the liver (unlike drugs).
<br>
<p>Conclusion:  Drugs will not bring on the singularity.  Intelligence  
<br>
relies on building up mental structures that allow you to find  
<br>
patterns in the world.  Non-stimulant drugs tend to decrease the  
<br>
efficiency of this process, hence they are likely to make you less  
<br>
intelligent than you would be if you studied.  While stimulant drugs  
<br>
may help with learning, they do not constitute a long-term solution.   
<br>
Our brain did not evolve to be hackable and it certainly isn't  
<br>
hackable using such crude interventions (i.e. hijacking the brain's  
<br>
neuromodulatory systems).  If you're stressed or having trouble  
<br>
concentrating, you should probably take up exercise/yoga/meditation.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
