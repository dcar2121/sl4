<em>&gt;&gt; What would you do if something impossible happened?  Not &quot;impossible&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like when something unlikely happens and you say &quot;Wow, that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; impossible!&quot; but something that has so little chance of happening  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it shouldn't happen.  The following story presents one possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recheck your probabilities. Consider the possibility of a Third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alternative you may have missed. You really, really have to see a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before you're not surprised by how weird the world is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fun experiment: What would you think if this, or something similar,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually happened? Suppose that tomorrow you saw something really,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really weird. You Google and nobody else has seen something similar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What odds would you place on:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - You simply hallucinated the whole thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - You saw correctly, but what you thought happened didn't happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (misinterpretation of evidence), and there's actually a mundane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - You've discovered something unknown to science and the books need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be appended.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - You've discovered something which violates existing science and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; books need to be rewritten.
</em><br>
<p>Between this and what Robin has pointed out, I think I need to revise  
<br>
the story.  I've not given any reason to discount the possibility that  
<br>
this is a normal, if rare, phenomenon that has somehow never been  
<br>
successfully documented and thus is excluded by or contradictory to  
<br>
established scientific knowledge.
<br>
<p>Also, I think that I should point out, based on the discussions my  
<br>
original post spawned, that my goal was never to tell a story about  
<br>
realizing that we're living in a simulation.  As I was thinking up a  
<br>
story about &quot;What do you think if something impossible actually  
<br>
happens,&quot; it just seemed that, assuming something actually impossible  
<br>
actually did happen, this would be a reasonable conclusion.  I know  
<br>
that I may be biased toward a simulation, so I might be missing other  
<br>
possibilities assuming something actually impossible happened.  Here's  
<br>
a short list of things I discounted:
<br>
<p>* Aliens have secret knowledge
<br>
* The supernatural
<br>
* Repeated, shared hallucination
<br>
* A dream
<br>
<p>either because you can't test it (if we all share the same  
<br>
hallucination, is this really much different from how we already  
<br>
experience the world?) or require information not in the story, like  
<br>
the idea of it being a dream that can't be discerned from reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would these change if your observations were repeatable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verifiable? Are there any possibilities I've overlooked?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
