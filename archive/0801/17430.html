<em>&gt; Here's what I mean. Say the world had never known about the drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;alcohol&quot;. Then some people at a pharmaceutical company discovered it and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; showed that it was safe in controlled clinical trials, and could be used for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some medical purposes (say as a low-grade anaesthetic). They also showed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it produced a state called &quot;drunkenness&quot;, associated with mild euphoria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and disinhibition, which let's for the sake of argument assume is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, if the discovery of alcohol happened in modern times, people would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very suspicious. They would worry that drinking a lot has bad side effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (they'd be right). They'd worry that it kills brain cells (check). They'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; note that it is habit forming (yup). In the face of all these potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hazards, most people would avoid the drug, and so humanity would fail to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover that alcohol consumed moderately is basically a good thing. Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, it might still be used to a limited degree for its original purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could do a similar thought experiment for coffee.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Is your point just that some people fail to be rational Bayesians, and use a
<br>
&quot;first, do no harm principal&quot; rather than weigh expected costs versus
<br>
expected benefits? If so, I guess I agree, with the caveat that the &quot;priors&quot;
<br>
for any *random* drug are *hugely* in favor of it harming rather than
<br>
helping. The priors are so large that it would be wise to wait for a
<br>
controlled study to conclude that the drug helps rather than harms, and even
<br>
then maybe wait to see if the study is successfully replicated. (In other
<br>
words, the priors are so large that the probability that the first
<br>
experiment was botched or was a statistical fluke may be *greater* than the
<br>
probability that the drug is actually more helpful than it is harmful.)
