<em>&gt; &gt; Evidence (not proof) that the universe is simulated by a finite state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or Turing machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1. The universe lacks uncomputable phenomena, such as real-valued states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; infinite memory computers such as Turing machines.  We lack a non
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probabilistic model of physics (quantum mechanics).  In a finite state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulation, a deterministic model would not be possible because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could not simulate itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If universe had 'uncomputable phenomena', how would you know? How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you test for presence of such things? Or equivalently, what does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it mean for uncomputable phenomena to be present in reality?
</em><br>
<p>An example of uncomputable phenomena would be something like classical
<br>
mechanics, in which the outcome of an experiment requires knowledge of the
<br>
position and velocity of particles with infinite precision.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finite state machine can perfectly well simulate itself, in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural interpretation that comes to mind (you'd have to additionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; define what it means for this formal construct to have a simulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something).
</em><br>
<p>A finite state machine with n states cannot model a machine with more than n
<br>
states.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2. The universe has finite entropy.  It has finite age T, finite size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by  the speed of light c, finite mass limited by G, and finite resolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; limited by Planck's constant h.  Its quantum state can be described in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (c^5)(T^2)/hG ~ 2^404.6 ~ 10^122 bits.  (By coincidence, if the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; divided into 10^122 parts, then one bit is the size of the smallest stable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particle, even though T, c, h, and G do not depend on the properties of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particles).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So? If anything, it supports knowability of universe, a counterpart of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it being simulated from complex unobservable environment.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is my point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3. Occam's Razor is observed in practice.  It is predicted by AIXI if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe has a computable probability distribution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you could please finally define what you mean by that. Occam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; razor rule corresponds to good choice of notation/representation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is usually picked to be compressible given distribution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described domain. What plays a role of notation in your argument, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why does its choice signify anything else?
</em><br>
<p>Hutter proved that the optimal behavior of a reward seeking agent in an
<br>
unknown environment simulated by a pair of interacting Turing machines is to
<br>
guess at each step that the environment is simulated by the shortest program
<br>
consistent with observation so far.  Occam's Razor is an example of this
<br>
strategy.  The proof is valid only for the case where the environment has a
<br>
computable probability distribution.  Of course this is not a proof that the
<br>
environment is simulated, but if Occam's Razor did not work in practice, it
<br>
would be strong evidence that the universe is not simulated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 4. The simplest algorithm (and by AIXI, the most likely) for modeling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; universe is to enumerate all Turing machines until a universe supporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intelligent life is found.  The most efficient way to execute this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is to run each machine with complexity n for 2^n steps.  We observe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complexity of physics (the free parameters in the Standard Model or most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; string  theories, plus general relativity) is on the order of n = a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hundred bits, which is the log of its entropy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Complexity is mostly in random content, so I don't see how you move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from simulation of universe of given complexity to complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical laws. Physical laws make up a tiniest part of complexity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world.
</em><br>
<p>The fastest way to find a universe supporting intelligent life is run the k'th
<br>
universe for k steps.  I claim that for our universe, k ~ 10^122.
