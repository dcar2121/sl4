</em><br>
<p>Our model of the world is one which assigns nonzero probability to all
<br>
possible observations.  One could conceive of a universe where this did not
<br>
hold; that we could model certain events to occur with probability 0 or 1, in
<br>
the same sense that some mathematical statements are absolutely true or false.
<br>
&nbsp;If we could (correctly) model all observations with certainty, it would be
<br>
proof that the universe is not simulated by a Turing machine.  In such a
<br>
universe, learning by induction would be suboptimal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I mean that if there is a program on A that can simulate any program on B,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then there is no program on B that could simulate this program on A.  I
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with algorithmic complexity.  In either case, it means you cannot build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer that could run an exact simulation of the universe (including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computer), unless the universe is not computable by a Turing machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay. But you say that question is if machine can simulate itself, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not an arbitrary machine already.
</em><br>
<p>The question is whether an observer (a computer) in a universe can model
<br>
(predict) the universe (including itself) exactly.  If the universe is
<br>
simulated by a Turing machine, then it is not possible.  A Turing machine
<br>
state can be described by a map: N -&gt; {0,1}.  There may be more powerful
<br>
machines that can model themselves in this sense, for example, R -&gt; {0,1}, N
<br>
-&gt; R, R -&gt; R, (R -&gt; R) -&gt; R, etc.  But because we lack non probabilistic
<br>
models of the universe, there is no evidence that anything more powerful than
<br>
a Turing machine is required.
