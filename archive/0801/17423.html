<em>&gt; &gt; Does anybody think that psychedelics might be the drug that acts

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some people go crazy and others have great insights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know it is sometimes claimed that psychedelics provide artistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspiration, but I am not aware of any claims that they have brought

</em><br>
<p>I was going to suggest that &quot;set and setting&quot; are so important with
<br>
psychedelics that it is very difficult to scientifically control for
<br>
study.  We can say with high confidence that perception will be
<br>
affected, but due to a lifetime of prior conditioning, there is too
<br>
much uncertainty how anyone will react to a given situation.  If
<br>
enough cases are statistically averaged, there might be a 'normal'
<br>
expectation - but there is no guarantee that the next test case will
<br>
be close enough to the statistical norm to have an expected
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p>I would also suggest that psychedelics is not &quot;the&quot; drug, but a class
<br>
of drugs.  The effects of a specific drug on a particular person can
<br>
vary widely.  For example; while Echinacea is generally regarded as a
<br>
safe immunostimulant to help reduce/prevent the common cold, I have
<br>
adverse reaction to it - probably an allergic response.  I also react
<br>
negatively to ibuprofen and penicillin.  Does that make their effect
<br>
&quot;random&quot;?  I imagine different brain chemistries could have similar
<br>
incompatible (or allergic) reactions to the individual members of the
<br>
psychedelic class of drugs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if anyone knows of any trippy science stories
</em><br>
<p>Maybe that depends on your notion of science.  For example - While
<br>
under the influence, a scientifically minded individual becomes
<br>
enthralled with dust particles floating in a beam of sunlight coming
<br>
through the blinds.  By a great leap of imagination, that perspective
<br>
leads to new insight about reference frames and the speed of light.
<br>
Is this experiential rediscovery of General Relativity equally
<br>
&quot;scientific&quot; than formulas written on a University blackboard?  I can
<br>
understand either perspective:  No; the experience itself was neutral
<br>
of either art or science.  The description of the experience after the
<br>
fact uses either artistic or scientific expression.  Yes; an
<br>
understanding of nature is achieved through careful observation.
<br>
Describing this knowledge is a separate communication problem.
