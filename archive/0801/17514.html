<em>&gt; &gt; Simulatedness is not directly observable, only miracles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are. Question of whether world is simulated is only relevant for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; finding out if miracles can happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can imagine two versions of the simulation argument. The weak version is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the universe is simulated on a computer with effectively infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational power. In that case, there is no way to determine that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a simulation, because the simulation is perfect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The strong version is that the computer running the simulation has (vast,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but) limited computing power. Because of this the designers need to &quot;cheat&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by introducing computational shortcuts. Several of the laws of physics can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be seen as reflections of this principle:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) Nature does not solve NP-hard problems.
</em><br>
<p>Quantum mechanics takes exponential time to solve, at least our probabilistic
<br>
interpretation of it does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) The central mystery of quantum mechanics, as revealed by the double-slit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment, can be seen as a computational shortcut: the simulation notices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the path of the electron does not affect anything on a &quot;macroscopic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scale, so it doesn't bother to compute the real trajectory.
</em><br>
<p>Paradoxes like the double slit, EPR, or Schrodinger's cat all go away if you
<br>
include the observer in the solution to Schrodinger's equations.  The complete
<br>
model is not probabilistic, but it is beyond our ability to solve it.  We are
<br>
the ones taking the computational shortcut.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) The speed of light can be seen as a result of running a simulation on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many machines: due to communication limits on the machines, there must be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit to how rapidly an event in one machine influences an event on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faraway machine.
</em><br>
<p>The speed of light limits the size of the universe (which must be finite in a
<br>
simulation).  We can't assume that concepts like distance, time, and velocity
<br>
have any meaning in the simulating universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) Conservation of energy can be interpreted as conservation of code length,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to the similarity between the Boltzmann factor and the Shannon optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; codelength rule.
</em><br>
<p>Conservation of mass/energy limits the size of the universe.  The relationship
<br>
you suggest between thermodynamic and information theoretic entropy is
<br>
unrelated to energy.  It is related to the direction of time.  A computation
<br>
irreversibly loses information, so its uncertainty about its environment
<br>
increases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5) Fermi's paradox can be interpreted as implying that only the Earth is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being simulated with high accuracy; in other regions the simulation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking too many computational shortcuts for life to exist.
</em><br>
<p>Or the universe is just big enough to form life on one planet with high
<br>
probability.  Or we are not alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This strong version of the simulation argument suggests new physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiments. For example, there should be a point at which the simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decides an effect is simply too far away to matter (e.g. the influence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pluto on the Earth's gravitational field). This kind of thing should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; testable with high-precision experiments.
</em><br>
<p>The strong version would require high algorithmic complexity in the laws of
<br>
physics, which we don't observe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just put yourself in the shoes of a simulation designer: you want to make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look &quot;real&quot; to the life forms, but you have limited computing power. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of tricks do you use?
</em><br>
<p>We don't know the motives of the designer, if there is one, but one trick
<br>
would be to program the simulated brains to believe without question that the
<br>
universe is real.
