<p>Oxford University Press - Apocalyptic AI: Visions of Heaven in
<br>
Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality, by Robert M.
<br>
Geraci.
<br>
<p>See my review of this excellent book. Robert has done a lot of field
<br>
reconnaissance work behind transhumanist lines in Second Life. The
<br>
book has a full report of Robert's field work and his interpretation
<br>
of the spirit of transhumanism, and the spirit of virtual worlds. This
<br>
book has started many interesting (and often vigorous) discussions in
<br>
both transhumanist and Second Life interest groups.
<br>
<p>Robert will come to Second Life for a book presentation and discussion
<br>
on Tuesday March 30, at 10am PST. The talk will take place in the
<br>
Singularity Club (which can be seen in the background of the picture)
<br>
on the Transvision Nexus island. Please follow this SLURL to teleport,
<br>
and bring interesting questions.

<p>New World Notes - Oxford Press Book on Digital Age Spirituality Argues
<br>
Second Life Provides Platform For Innovative Religious Thinking: The
<br>
ultra-prestigious Oxford University just published a book devoted to
<br>
theology in the digital age: Apocalyptic AI Visions of Heaven in
<br>
Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality. It's written
<br>
by Manhattan College professor Robert Geraci, known in Second Life as
<br>
Soren Ferlinghetti (pictured), and unsurprisingly, a whole chapter is
<br>
devoted to Second Life, and conversations with several well-known
<br>
Extropians (sometimes called transhumanists), who often see Second
<br>
Life as a means for transcending the human body.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the publishers' site: &quot;Description: Apocalyptic AI, the hope that
</em><br>
we might one day upload our minds into machines or cyberspace and live
<br>
forever, is a surprisingly wide-spread and influential idea, affecting
<br>
everything from the world view of online gamers to government research
<br>
funding and philosophical thought. In Apocalyptic AI, Robert Geraci
<br>
offers the first serious account of this &quot;cyber-theology&quot; and the
<br>
people who promote it.
<br>
<p>Drawing on interviews with roboticists and AI researchers and with
<br>
devotees of the online game Second Life, among others, Geraci
<br>
illuminates the ideas of such advocates of Apocalyptic AI as Hans
<br>
Moravec and Ray Kurzweil. He reveals that the rhetoric of Apocalyptic
<br>
AI is strikingly similar to that of the apocalyptic traditions of
<br>
Judaism and Christianity. In both systems, the believer is trapped in
<br>
a dualistic universe and expects a resolution in which he or she will
<br>
be translated to a transcendent new world and live forever in a
<br>
glorified new body. Equally important, Geraci shows how this worldview
<br>
shapes our culture. For instance, Apocalyptic AI has influenced
<br>
funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation, helping to
<br>
prioritize robotics and AI research. It has become the ideology of
<br>
choice for online gamers, such as those involved in Second Life; it
<br>
has had a profound impact on the study of the mind; and it has
<br>
inspired scientists and theologians alike to wonder about the super
<br>
robots of the future. Should we think of robots as persons? What kind
<br>
of morality would intelligent robots espouse?
<br>
<p>Apocalyptic AI has become a powerful force in modern culture. In this
<br>
superb volume, Robert Geraci shines a light on this belief system,
<br>
revealing what it is and how it is changing society.&quot;
