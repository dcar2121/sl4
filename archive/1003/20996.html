<p><em>&gt; Oxford University Press - Apocalyptic AI: Visions of Heaven in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality, by Robert M.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geraci.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See my review of this excellent book. Robert has done a lot of field
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reconnaissance work behind transhumanist lines in Second Life. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book has a full report of Robert's field work and his interpretation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the spirit of transhumanism, and the spirit of virtual worlds. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book has started many interesting (and often vigorous) discussions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both transhumanist and Second Life interest groups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert will come to Second Life for a book presentation and discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Tuesday March 30, at 10am PST. The talk will take place in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity Club (which can be seen in the background of the picture)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Transvision Nexus island. Please follow this SLURL to teleport,

<em>&gt; New World Notes - Oxford Press Book on Digital Age Spirituality Argues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second Life Provides Platform For Innovative Religious Thinking: The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultra-prestigious Oxford University just published a book devoted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theology in the digital age: Apocalyptic AI Visions of Heaven in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality. It's written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by Manhattan College professor Robert Geraci, known in Second Life as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soren Ferlinghetti (pictured), and unsurprisingly, a whole chapter is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devoted to Second Life, and conversations with several well-known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians (sometimes called transhumanists), who often see Second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Life as a means for transcending the human body.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From the publishers' site: &quot;Description: Apocalyptic AI, the hope that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we might one day upload our minds into machines or cyberspace and live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forever, is a surprisingly wide-spread and influential idea, affecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything from the world view of online gamers to government research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding and philosophical thought. In Apocalyptic AI, Robert Geraci
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offers the first serious account of this &quot;cyber-theology&quot; and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who promote it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drawing on interviews with roboticists and AI researchers and with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devotees of the online game Second Life, among others, Geraci
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illuminates the ideas of such advocates of Apocalyptic AI as Hans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moravec and Ray Kurzweil. He reveals that the rhetoric of Apocalyptic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI is strikingly similar to that of the apocalyptic traditions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Judaism and Christianity. In both systems, the believer is trapped in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dualistic universe and expects a resolution in which he or she will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be translated to a transcendent new world and live forever in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glorified new body. Equally important, Geraci shows how this worldview
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shapes our culture. For instance, Apocalyptic AI has influenced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation, helping to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prioritize robotics and AI research. It has become the ideology of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice for online gamers, such as those involved in Second Life; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has had a profound impact on the study of the mind; and it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspired scientists and theologians alike to wonder about the super
</em><br>
<em>&gt; robots of the future. Should we think of robots as persons? What kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of morality would intelligent robots espouse?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apocalyptic AI has become a powerful force in modern culture. In this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superb volume, Robert Geraci shines a light on this belief system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revealing what it is and how it is changing society.&quot;
