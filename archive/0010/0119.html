<p>
<em>&gt; Ben, thanks for posting the excerpt from your book. It raises month' worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of discussion; let me comment on just two issues:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure why you would choose 'compassion' as your primary social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtue. I would think that honesty &amp; fairness ...
</em><br>
<p>I guess this gets into fundamental philosophical/political taste
<br>
<p>Since Eliezer is affiliated with the Extropians, I'll guess that some of you
<br>
are
<br>
libertarian in political philosophy, whereas I tend more toward the
<br>
democratic-socialist;
<br>
this difference appears to have something to do with whether &quot;compassion&quot; or
<br>
&quot;fairness&quot;
<br>
is taken as a fundamental value.  I know that compassion has a weak
<br>
reputation among
<br>
libertarians.  Sasha Chislenko, a good friend of mine and a libertarian,
<br>
used to talk about how the air
<br>
should be metered out for a price, and those who couldn't afford it should
<br>
fairly suffocate ;&gt;
<br>
(BTW, I am strongly in favor of liberties like the right to take drugs and
<br>
to modify one's
<br>
own body, etc. -- I don't want to diverge the conversation into the
<br>
political arena, but ethics
<br>
and politics are not that different...)
<br>
<p><p>But there's a more direct answer too.  Honesty is a good value but doesn't
<br>
get you very far.
<br>
So, Webminds and other AI's should be honest, but, if a computer system is
<br>
honest with me about
<br>
the fact that it really wants to kill me, I still won't be very happy with
<br>
it.  Thus, I view honesty
<br>
as a valuable virtue, but not foundational.
<br>
<p>Even very good people are sometimes tactically dishonest --
<br>
&quot;white lies.&quot;  I used to believe that this was a terrible practice that
<br>
should be stomped out, but I
<br>
have since learned its benefits....  Certainly there have been situations
<br>
where telling one of my kids a white
<br>
lie saves them a lot of purposeless pain.
<br>
<p>But this doesn't mean that honesty isn't a virtuous value...
<br>
in fact, it can easily be programmed into Webmind, as a hard-wired Feeling
<br>
which negatively increments the
<br>
happiness feeling when what is uttered contradicts what is known.  This will
<br>
cause the system to have
<br>
a discomfort with dishonesty, but not to be unable to be dishonest when the
<br>
situation calls for it
<br>
<p>The reason I focused on compassion is that I believe this emotion is the
<br>
foundation of social
<br>
life.  Without compassion, families and friendships would not exist, and
<br>
societies would continually
<br>
be like giant Melrose Place episodes....  Compassion is the &quot;glue&quot; that
<br>
holds societies together.
<br>
I can't prove this mathematically -- the right kind of math doesn't exist --
<br>
but I suppose this can
<br>
be verified/falsified one day using experiments with AI systems (of course
<br>
this would take vast
<br>
amounts of hardware to do systematically)
<br>
<p>Fairness seems to me to follow logically from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) compassion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) a &quot;golden rule&quot; inference in which a system models others by analogy to
<br>
itself
<br>
<p>If an organism seeks to maximize the happiness of itself and all others in a
<br>
transaction, using the
<br>
golden rule inference heuristic, it will arrive at the strategy of
<br>
fairness...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, a more fundamental problem is that you seem to assume that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent actors (like Webmind) will have roughly the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and intelligence - else cooperation would not be the likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcome.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't assume this, but it's the simplest case to analyze.  Otherwise
<br>
one has
<br>
yet more complex dynamics.  If one has actors with different degrees of
<br>
power then one
<br>
has to study coalition formation and breakdown ... the outcome you describe,
<br>
one dictator
<br>
coming to power, is only one among many possible outcomes, and I don't know
<br>
how to estimate
<br>
the probability of this outcome.
<br>
<p>I guess you suspect that one system is going to have the secret to
<br>
exponential intelligence growth
<br>
(once it attains the ability to rewrite its own code).  I don't think it's
<br>
going to be quite so easy.
<br>
I suspect that the first portion of the exponential intelligence growth
<br>
curve isn't going to have
<br>
that high of an exponent -- that, even once an Ai system starts
<br>
self-rewriting, it'll still have a lot
<br>
to gain from human programmers' intervention.  And, once someone does attain
<br>
a generally acknowledged
<br>
&quot;real AI&quot; system, others will observe its behavior and reverse-engineer it,
<br>
pouring vast amounts of
<br>
resources into playing &quot;catch-up.&quot;  In short, I have a different intuition
<br>
from you about the amount
<br>
of first-mover advantage that anyone will have.  (And this is not motivated
<br>
by ego in any way, since
<br>
I suspect my Webmind system is going to be the first mover....)
<br>
<p>Great thoughts, thanks!!
<br>
