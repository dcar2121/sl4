From: 	<a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sysopmind.com?Subject=RE:%20Ben%20what%20are%20your%20views%20and%20concerns">owner-sl4@sysopmind.com</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-sl4@sysopmind.com?Subject=RE:%20Ben%20what%20are%20your%20views%20and%20concerns">owner-sl4@sysopmind.com</a>]  On Behalf
<br>
Of Ben Goertzel
<br>
<p>I guess this gets into fundamental philosophical/political taste....I'll
<br>
guess that some of you are libertarian in political philosophy....I don't
<br>
want to diverge the conversation into the political arena, but ethics and
<br>
politics are not that different...
<br>
<p>You are right, we have somewhat different political views. However, I would
<br>
not characterize mine as 'taste', rather logical conclusions. It is not so
<br>
much that politics and ethics are 'not that different', but rationally held
<br>
political positions are a consequence of moral beliefs (which in turn,
<br>
usually depends on epistemology, and that on ontology). But I agree that we
<br>
should perhaps not get into this here...
<br>
<p>...Honesty is a good value but doesn't get you very far. So, Webminds and
<br>
other AI's should be honest, but, if a computer system is honest with me
<br>
about the fact that it really wants to kill me, I still won't be very happy
<br>
with it.  Thus, I view honesty as a valuable virtue, but not foundational.
<br>
<p>I would rather have honesty, and know my AI's intentions rather than it
<br>
'compassionately' lying to me 'for my own good'. I think that both people
<br>
and AIs function better that way. (There is a whole complex philosophical,
<br>
psychological theory behind this view). Basically, I think that
<br>
self-ownership (authority over self, and responsibility for one's actions)
<br>
is key to flourishing of societies. Honesty is crucial both as a personal
<br>
value (not lying to yourself) and as a social value (knowing what to expect
<br>
from others, plus getting valuable feedback).
<br>
<p>Even very good people are sometimes tactically dishonest -- &quot;white
<br>
lies.&quot;....
<br>
<p>An interesting, and tricky, issue. Have you read James Halperin's novel 'The
<br>
Truth Machine' ? Great exploration of this and other honesty issues.
<br>
<p>But this doesn't mean that honesty isn't a virtuous value... in fact, it can
<br>
easily be programmed into Webmind, as a hard-wired Feeling which negatively
<br>
increments the happiness feeling when what is uttered contradicts what is
<br>
known.  This will cause the system to have a discomfort with dishonesty, but
<br>
not to be unable to be dishonest when the situation calls for it
<br>
<p>Yes, this is important. There are higher values than honesty. You don't tell
<br>
a child-molester where the kids are...
<br>
<p>The reason I focused on compassion is that I believe this emotion is the
<br>
foundation of social life.  Without compassion, families and friendships
<br>
would not exist...
<br>
<p>I think that it is the (self-interested) value that others represent to us
<br>
that is the best foundation for relationships. Do you have a definition for
<br>
'compassion'? I see it as a byproduct of valuing others.
<br>
<p>Fairness seems to me to follow logically from: a) compassion. b) a &quot;golden
<br>
rule&quot; inference in which a system models others by analogy to itself. If an
<br>
organism seeks to maximize the happiness of itself and all others in a
<br>
transaction, using the golden rule inference heuristic, it will arrive at
<br>
the strategy of fairness...
<br>
<p>I'm sure you are aware of the serious problems with 'the Golden Rule' as a
<br>
moral principle. All of this gets us deep into moral philosophy. I have
<br>
written quite a bit about this.
<br>
<p>I guess you suspect that one system is going to have the secret to
<br>
exponential intelligence growth (once it attains the ability to rewrite its
<br>
own code).  I don't think it's going to be quite so easy. I suspect that the
<br>
first portion of the exponential intelligence growth curve isn't going to
<br>
have that high of an exponent -- that, even once an Ai system starts
<br>
self-rewriting, it'll still have a lot to gain from human programmers'
<br>
intervention.  And, once someone does attain a generally acknowledged &quot;real
<br>
AI&quot; system, others will observe its behavior and reverse-engineer it,
<br>
pouring vast amounts of resources into playing &quot;catch-up.&quot;  In short, I have
<br>
a different intuition from you about the amount of first-mover advantage
<br>
that anyone will have.  (And this is not motivated by ego in any way, since
<br>
I suspect my Webmind system is going to be the first mover....)
<br>
<p>I agree with you, that here we are in 'intuition' territory. My own approach
<br>
to AI design leads me to believe that at a certain point of intelligence
<br>
there will be enough of an exponential burst for one system to dominate. I
<br>
don't think that hardware will be a major limiting factor. On the other
<br>
hand, perhaps each type of intelligence has its own upper theoretical limit.
<br>
If so, I haven't yet identified it.
<br>
<p>All the best,
<br>
<p>Peter
