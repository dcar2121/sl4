Ben, thanks for posting the excerpt from your book. It raises month' worth
<br>
of discussion; let me comment on just two issues:
<br>
<p>I'm not sure why you would choose 'compassion' as your primary social
<br>
virtue. I would think that honesty &amp; fairness (plus a dash of benevolence -
<br>
giving the benefit of doubt) among intelligent agents is more likely to
<br>
optimize effectiveness. They would interact on the basis of the trader
<br>
principle. Agents would trade information and specialized computational
<br>
resources with each other. Trade can be based on a barter, money, or some
<br>
virtual currency - negotiated, auctioned, or whatever. Networks of
<br>
reputation and 'policing' agencies would minimize motivation for 'cheating'.
<br>
<p>However, a more fundamental problem is that you seem to assume that all
<br>
intelligent actors (like Webmind) will have roughly the same amount of power
<br>
and intelligence - else cooperation would not be the likely outcome. I think
<br>
it far more likely that a particular AI (including all of its distributed,
<br>
but tightly coupled intelligence) will be have far superior intelligence,
<br>
and thus totally dominate lesser agents. It's hard to see how one ends up
<br>
with stable communities of intelligent agents. Additionally, if this AI can
<br>
boot-strap its raw intelligence (something many of us are working on), one
<br>
clearly runs the risk of even more fundamental dominance.
