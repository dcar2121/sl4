</em><br>
<p>I don't think Ben Goertzel was talking about ownership of facts, just
<br>
ownership of the facts in ready-to-think format for your favorite AI.
<br>
<p>I have done some thinking along those lines, but mostly back when I was still
<br>
thinking in terms of an open-source model for developing AI.  It's not easy to
<br>
see a good way that knowledge could be sold for closed-source AIs - except by
<br>
companies with access to the source - unless we're assuming that the knowledge
<br>
format is both simple and independent of the proprietary thought processes. 
<br>
This doesn't seem too likely to me; more likely, the &quot;format&quot; is a third of
<br>
what you need to know to create an AI, and another third is composed of
<br>
thoughts stored in that format.
<br>
<p>Another variable strongly affecting the saleability of knowledge is the degree
<br>
to which the knowledge can be made independent of the particular context of
<br>
the AI that created it, or the extent to which that context can be packaged
<br>
with the knowledge.  We aren't just talking about things like what type of
<br>
fluctuations indicate anomalies, but the fact that real knowledge grounds in
<br>
experience, and experience is perceived in ways that link into the rest of the
<br>
knowledge base.  So to export knowledge plus grounding, you have to export the
<br>
experience, and to export the particular experiences, you may need to export
<br>
the rest of the experiential and knowledge base.
<br>
<p>The upshot is that brute-force exportation of knowledge may be prohibitively
<br>
expensive; packing fully grounded knowledge into smaller forms requires either
<br>
really dumb or highly sophisticated AI.  This may not hold equally true of all
<br>
forms of knowledge, and sufficiently fault-tolerant AIs may be able to easily
<br>
deal with imperfect integration of experiential bases.
<br>
<p>Also, the problem in its rawest form only holds with respect to exporting
<br>
knowledge that was formed by the AI without human cooperation, to another AI
<br>
with a pre-existing knowledge base formed without human cooperation.  Where
<br>
first-time sales of AIs are concerned, there may be a legitimate separation of
<br>
selling the AI itself versus selling the various thought processes needed to
<br>
make up the AI.  It may not be a prohibitively expensive proposition to get
<br>
knowledge bases and experience bases manufactured by the same company to
<br>
integrate automatically, as long as the AI is just starting up.  After that
<br>
you have the problem of integration with the previous experiential base.
<br>
<p>The same thing goes for selling sensory modalities for source code or
<br>
financial accounting packages or commodities trading.  Hey, Ben, aren't you
<br>
glad I didn't patent that business model back in 1998?
