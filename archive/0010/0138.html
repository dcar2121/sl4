<p>
Ben,
<br>
<p>Thank you for your response.  You are obviously an ethical and quite
<br>
reasonable person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously, I don't share your &quot;huge problem&quot; with the practice of patenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   My problem with your problem is this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Implementing my design for AI is a big project.  In order to get it done, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raise money from major investors.  By taking this money, I undertake a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiduciary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility to the investors, to get them a good return on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the quest to guarantee these investors a return on their investment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patents are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a valuable tool.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are ways to get a good return without patenting the actual
<br>
software techniques involved and thus forbidding other development using
<br>
those techniques except as permitted by your company or its designates. 
<br>
As I am sure you are aware there are quite valid concerns about locking
<br>
up algorithms in this way and reasonable arguments that doing so hurts
<br>
software evolution more than hit spurs new software development.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that a hell of a lot of great technological developments have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplished in the commercial domain.  So I don't see why doing AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is likely to hold back progress.  And patenting is part and parcel of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US capitalist system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually I find that much of the software environment is largely
<br>
stagnant.  Many of the tools used have not evolved much at all in the
<br>
two decades I have been involved.  Some of the best developments never
<br>
struck market gold and are put aside for technically less powerful and
<br>
useful tools.  At some latter time some subset is brought forward as the
<br>
lastest hot new thing.  I have seen this cycle too many times to not
<br>
suspect that something is wrong with the way we have tied software to
<br>
the market.   
<br>
<p>Patenting is not &quot;part and parcel&quot; of capitalism except in what used to
<br>
be very delimited areas and for delimited reasons.  Patents are in
<br>
no-wise essential to having a capitalist system.  Software patents are
<br>
relatively new on the scene.  There are patents on the books today for
<br>
things I and others I know were inventing and using 10 years or more
<br>
before they were filed.  But we would not stand a prayer of pulling
<br>
together the cash and evidence enough (actually high priced legal
<br>
loophole detection ) to challenge many of these.  There are patents
<br>
enough on the books that if I looked hard at anything I've done in the
<br>
last decade I could find at least one patent it arguably infringed.  And
<br>
there are thousands of software patents that are still pending.  Please
<br>
tell me how a system that will stop me and others from innovating on our
<br>
own an will expose us to absolutely ruinous costs, legal dangers and
<br>
detours around patent landmines is for anyone's good.  Patenting
<br>
software slgorithms and concepts is no better to me than patenting a
<br>
mathematical proof.   Copyright it sure.  Even keep it proprietary if
<br>
you have to to make your bread.  But patents are much more ruinous. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I'm not in love with the current socioeconomic framework in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I live.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think it's particularly horrible either.  Anyway, instead of trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm working within it to the best of my abilities to achieve my scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering goals.  I could not easily be doing what I'm doing now in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; academia, or in an open-source
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project.  The degree of focus and tight coordination and careful testing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the project is  much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more easily attained in a commercial setting.  The best alternative would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a well-funded government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research lab, but the government never offered me money to build a thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine, private investors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did.
</em><br>
<p>Understood, and of course I don't at all blame you in any way, shape or
<br>
form. I get my daily bread persuading commercial proprietary companies
<br>
that they need some part of what I want to build.  If anything I am
<br>
envious because you are being getting paid to build something so
<br>
interesting to me.  At the same time though I have seen great things,
<br>
some of them designed and built by me, end up as shelf-ware or dumbed
<br>
down to inanity because the &quot;owners&quot; didn't know what to do with it or
<br>
decided it was more profitable to leak it out a little at a time or to
<br>
twist it into the computer fashion of the month.  I've spend a lot of
<br>
years rewriting the same code because some company &quot;owned&quot; the last
<br>
umpteen versions I and others wrote and even if we paid them for it we
<br>
would not have the source to seamlessly plug into what we were doing.  
<br>
<p>I don't know how to fix it.  I think the Open Source or Free Software
<br>
movement has extremely valid moral and engineering points.   I think a
<br>
freer flowing of all information and especially of software is essential
<br>
to our getting to the breakthrough points much less the Singularity. 
<br>
But I don't honestly know yet how to make my living, being a pure
<br>
designer and developer, and have all of the source available to
<br>
everyone.  I think it is the right direction to go in though.
<br>
