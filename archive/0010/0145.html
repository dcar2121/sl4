<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think Ben Goertzel was talking about ownership of facts, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ownership of the facts in ready-to-think format for your favorite AI.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this sentence raises an interesting question (which you address in a
<br>
slightly
<br>
different way later on in your message)
<br>
<p>To what extent will it be possible to create/sell a &quot;lobe&quot; of facts/know-how
<br>
(i.e. declarative + procedural knowledge), that will be usable by
<br>
MANY DIFFERENT AI programs, not just one
<br>
<p>To the extent that a &quot;mind standard&quot; for declarative and procedural
<br>
knowledge
<br>
interchange can be created, I think we'll all benefit
<br>
<p>This is one way to get some of the benefits of open-source AI even in a
<br>
commercial-AI
<br>
context..
<br>
<p>For instance, we've created a couple languages that we plan to release into
<br>
the public
<br>
domain in the not too distant future
<br>
<p>KNOW -- a declarative knowledge representation language, sort of like a more
<br>
flexible,
<br>
fuzzy version of predicate logic
<br>
<p>Psynese -- a procedural knowledge representation language: basically a
<br>
generic functional
<br>
programming framework where the functions involved may be black-box objects
<br>
obscuring
<br>
proprietary functionality
<br>
<p>AIP -- Agent Interaction Platform ... a general framework for different Net
<br>
agents to
<br>
interact with each other according to languages of their choice (e.g. KNOW,
<br>
Psynese)
<br>
<p>We also have Webmind-specific languages such as MindScript (a JavaScript
<br>
extension)
<br>
and MindSpeak (more conversational in nature), which are by their nature not
<br>
portable to
<br>
different AI architectures
<br>
<p>Presumably in the future, if there were many different AI's all able to read
<br>
in KNOW or
<br>
Psynese files, then one could sell declarative + procedural knowledge
<br>
broadly, to users of
<br>
any compliant AI.  One will have 'mind format converters'  ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; more likely, the &quot;format&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a third of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you need to know to create an AI, and another third is composed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts stored in that format.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a KNOW or Psynese file doesn't tell you how to create a mind that can
<br>
use the
<br>
knowledge is contains ... it is only useful if you already have an AI system
<br>
of some
<br>
kind to load it into ...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another variable strongly affecting the saleability of knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to which the knowledge can be made independent of the particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI that created it, or the extent to which that context can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be packaged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the knowledge.  We aren't just talking about things like what type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fluctuations indicate anomalies, but the fact that real knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounds in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, and experience is perceived in ways that link into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge base.  So to export knowledge plus grounding, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to export the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, and to export the particular experiences, you may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to export
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the experiential and knowledge base.
</em><br>
<p>This is a serious issue, which gets at the very basis of culture and
<br>
communication.
<br>
<p>The concept &quot;cat&quot; doesn't mean the same thing to you as to me, as to my
<br>
3-year-old daughter.  Yet we can all talk about cats together with little
<br>
confusion
<br>
<p>Similarly, when a Webmind exports KNOW and Psynese files reporting its
<br>
knowledge, unless
<br>
it exports its ENTIRE mind, it's not exporting enough for someone to totally
<br>
understand
<br>
the knowledge it had.  On the other hand, if it's communicating with an
<br>
adequately similar
<br>
mind, it can presumably do a fairly good job.
<br>
<p>What we do in producing English sentences is, partly: We have a thought in
<br>
mind, and we seek
<br>
the closest word/phrase (i.e. the closest &quot;culturally common idea&quot;) to
<br>
express it.  Similarly,
<br>
an AI can take a piece of its insular knowledge, and seek the closest
<br>
&quot;culturally common idea&quot;
<br>
to express it.
<br>
<p>I once invented an elaborate scheme to permit this, involving a network of
<br>
&quot;culture servers&quot;
<br>
that maintain the &quot;average knowledge state&quot; of all the AI's in the world --
<br>
a kind of dynamic
<br>
&quot;language&quot; for inter-AI communication.  So when one AI wanted to communicate
<br>
with another, it would
<br>
a) choose a hunk of its own brain to send, b) use the culture server to
<br>
translate it into
<br>
communally comprehensible language, as closely as possible.
<br>
<p>Well, we haven't implemented this yet -- it's still a couple years off --
<br>
but I still think the
<br>
idea is good
<br>
<p>The main point is: language allows us to export knowledge without grounding;
<br>
and, among AI's,
<br>
language can be more dynamic than among humans, because of the different
<br>
technological platform
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The same thing goes for selling sensory modalities for source code or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financial accounting packages or commodities trading.  Hey, Ben,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glad I didn't patent that business model back in 1998?
</em><br>
<p>You couldn't have; I patented it in 1997  ;D
