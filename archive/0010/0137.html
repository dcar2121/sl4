Hi,
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I have a huge problem with patenting aspects of artificial intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architectures.  This radically slows down research and development which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means it puts fences on the intellectual commons that impoverish us all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It makes no more sense (and arguably less) than patenting the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genome. Please point us to the relevant patent application.  I hope you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have not tried to patent this node and link approach as many have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought of it and worked with it independently.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, we are not patenting things that have been invented by others.
<br>
I know that some big software firms have made a habit of this, but we are
<br>
too
<br>
ethical for that, and also lack the spare cash to spend on lawyers for such
<br>
projects.
<br>
<p>Obviously, nodes and links as a general concept underly both neural network
<br>
and
<br>
semantic network AI architectures.  There are in fact many existing patents
<br>
for
<br>
specific neural net and semantic net AI algorithms, aimed at particular
<br>
problems.
<br>
<p>We are not averse to patenting specific aspects of our AI system which are
<br>
genuinely
<br>
unique, however.
<br>
<p>As our patent applications have not yet been approved (this takes a few
<br>
years, generally),
<br>
they are not yet public domain.
<br>
<p>Obviously, I don't share your &quot;huge problem&quot; with the practice of patenting
<br>
AI stuff.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem with your problem is this.
<br>
Implementing my design for AI is a big project.  In order to get it done, I
<br>
needed to
<br>
raise money from major investors.  By taking this money, I undertake a
<br>
fiduciary
<br>
responsibility to the investors, to get them a good return on their
<br>
investment.
<br>
In the quest to guarantee these investors a return on their investment,
<br>
patents are
<br>
a valuable tool.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that a hell of a lot of great technological developments have
<br>
been
<br>
accomplished in the commercial domain.  So I don't see why doing AI
<br>
commercially
<br>
is likely to hold back progress.  And patenting is part and parcel of the
<br>
current
<br>
US capitalist system.
<br>
<p>Personally, I'm not in love with the current socioeconomic framework in
<br>
which I live.
<br>
I don't think it's particularly horrible either.  Anyway, instead of trying
<br>
to change it,
<br>
I'm working within it to the best of my abilities to achieve my scientific
<br>
and
<br>
engineering goals.  I could not easily be doing what I'm doing now in
<br>
academia, or in an open-source
<br>
project.  The degree of focus and tight coordination and careful testing
<br>
that the project is  much
<br>
more easily attained in a commercial setting.  The best alternative would be
<br>
a well-funded government
<br>
research lab, but the government never offered me money to build a thinking
<br>
machine, private investors
<br>
did.
<br>
