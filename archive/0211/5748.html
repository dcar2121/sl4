<em>&gt;&gt; I often suspect that people look at these questions backwards (though 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm not saying you Samantha). That they struggle with a question like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Should I commit suicide?&quot; as a separate question from &quot;What should I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; do?&quot; Yet 'commit suicide' is an answer to this initial, fundamental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; question whereas &quot;Should I commit suicide?&quot; is a question that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; probably just came up after internally hearing &quot;Awful feeling! Stop 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the pain! Won't you please stop the pain? I matter!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I guess I know what your answer to the question is and you can guess 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that I don't agree. I felt I should point out that it would be wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for anyone to struggle with this question by agonizing over whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their &quot;world is hell&quot; or whether they have no hope or how it will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; affect family and friends, without ever considering whether they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agonizing over totally the wrong things (which I think they probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From your wording I don't believe you have any idea what my answer to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this question is or which question I asked myself to get over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering this possibility completely.   It became obvious to me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back when I did consider suicide an option (decades ago) that no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter how much pain, frustration, helplessness and so on I might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feeling now, this world and this life was the &quot;only game in town&quot;.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All possibility, for ill or good, is here.    Even so-called afterlife 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; models have one coming back to the same or worse until a different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice is made.   So it was rather obvious that &quot;Should I commit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide&quot; is not the question.   However,  I don't begrudge any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentient the right to wrestle with their pain and options and decide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so basic a question for themselves.  I would not presume to answer it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for others.

<p><p>I wasn't trying to guess what you were thinking about when you were 
<br>
considering suicide or why you decided not to. I was talking about the 
<br>
question you asked about whether it is rational to go on given the 
<br>
factors you specified. I was guessing that your answer was: &quot;it's a 
<br>
personal decision and you can't say that there is a correct or incorrect 
<br>
answer&quot; or &quot;it depends how much your world is hell&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sorry my wording wasn't clear. And I certainly wouldn't want anyone to 
<br>
think that the &quot;answer&quot; I mentioned in the first sentence of the second 
<br>
paragraph was referring to the question I had just asked! I originally 
<br>
had a longer message that I struggled with for a while and then shrunk 
<br>
down to the one I posted.
