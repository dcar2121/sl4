</em><br>
<p>Well, firstly, we don't have &quot;sponsors&quot; for Biomind in the sense that you're
<br>
thinking.   We have a start-up company, Biomind LLC, with a little seed
<br>
investment to pay for developing our first Novamente-based bioinformatics
<br>
product.   I am the decision-maker for Biomind and I have a responsibility
<br>
to direct Biomind in a way that will benefit its investors, and is
<br>
consistent with its mission.  Fortunately, there is some benefit for AGI
<br>
along the way, due to the common use/development of Novamente for Biomind &amp;
<br>
for our AGI project.
<br>
<p>Having said that -- actually, your idea *does* make sense.  Extracting
<br>
information from research articles is an important aspect of bioinformatics,
<br>
and one that Biomind hopes to get into at some point in the future, though
<br>
not for our first product release.  And it's a fact that a lot of info in
<br>
bio research articles is given in diagrammatic &amp; graphical form.
<br>
<p>We also have been discussing using 3D geometric methods to analyze molecular
<br>
structure, which has some overlap with macro 3D perceptual processing...
<br>
<p>So, yeah, there's a lot of overlap ... but by no means enough to eliminate
<br>
the need for separate AGI funding, even if Biomind were a huge company (and
<br>
now it's just me and a handful of programmers).
