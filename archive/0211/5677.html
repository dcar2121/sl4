the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with the idea that it's important to make Singularity ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accessible to the general public, or at least to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively-well-educated section of the general public (a category which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes the wealthy individuals likely to donate to Singularity-focused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research).
</em><br>
<p>Making a few wealthy people to donate would do. It's just that getting those
<br>
few to donate would involve creating increased awareness (i.e., &quot;buzz&quot;)
<br>
among general public. To catch one big fish you need a much bigger net in
<br>
this case.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; This is why I'm so happy with the work of Ray Kurzweil, who has done more
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; this direction than anyone else in recent years.  He doesn't get
</em><br>
everything
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;100% right&quot; in my view, but he brings his readers 90% of the way there,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is a big improvement over the contemporary default mind-state...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I am not sure how to accomplish really dramatic public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;consciousness-raising&quot; about the Singularity.  Publishing pop-science
</em><br>
books
<br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem to do it -- even Kurzweil's books, which sell fairly well,
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; not come close to transforming general public awareness.
</em><br>
<p>But a book would be just a vehicle, an excuse, to do promotion which would
<br>
be the real goal. Kurzweil understands that very well, he's everywhere -
<br>
magazines, radio, internet, TV. To get a cheap access to the public you
<br>
don't even need a book, just the right idea. There are so many
<br>
science/technology pop magazines that would probably love to do a story on
<br>
AGI research. But in order for someone to do a story on you, you need to
<br>
&quot;sell&quot; the topic in a way that benefits the writer too. Take, for example,
<br>
Time magazine. They love to speculate about the future, and future of
<br>
science. One time, they even devoted the whole cover page and few pages
<br>
inside to the possibilities of nanotechnology. I can't imagine how could
<br>
they object to AGI research. Of course, you would need to suggest the story
<br>
to them in a way that is simple for them to understand so you would talk
<br>
about &quot;building minds&quot; instead of &quot;artificial general intelligence
<br>
research&quot;.
<br>
<p>The benefit of even a minimal exposure would be an increased awareness among
<br>
general public. Just think about the people who read those magazines, and
<br>
how many people read this stuff. This is exactly the right audience for the
<br>
message (educated, curious, socially-aware, technology/science-friendly,
<br>
generally wealthier crowd). With the right message and right strategy, you
<br>
could create enough awareness very cheaply. Enough to cause a chain reaction
<br>
of small donations, or, perhaps or even getting one big donor. The thing is,
<br>
in order to get a few people to donate, you need many, many  more to be
<br>
aware of all this.
<br>
<p>A magazine like Time is just an example. You could follow the same strategy
<br>
with other magazines, and other media, and as much as you want. It's
<br>
definitely better than nothing. This goes back to what I wrote earlier. This
<br>
research is so &quot;pie-in-the-sky&quot; that it makes sense to start focusing on
<br>
general public since the money is there too.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In thinking about how to bring Singularity ideas to the masses, I'm struck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by how savvy Kurzweil's approach has been, actually.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The Singularity on the other hand does not have this same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitive/emotional appeal to average humans.  It can't be spun as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affirmation of life, nature or human common sense and intuition....  Chaos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory and quantum reality have been spun to be comforting to the average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human -- but how do we spin the Singularity this way???
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in order to create a message that would resonate with people, one needs
<br>
to put a good spin on Singularity. Instead of talking about Jupiter Brains,
<br>
Transition Guides, Singularitarianism, or boring AI technical details you
<br>
might just as well say something like &quot;FAI could help to cure cancer and
<br>
aids&quot;, &quot;FAI would be helpful in figuring out your material problems&quot;, or
<br>
that &quot;FAI could save people from dying&quot;. That's basically how the
<br>
nanotechnology gets &quot;sold&quot; to the masses. And since FAI could do nanotech,
<br>
well........ you get the idea. If anybody is interested enough, the FAI
<br>
websites would provide the further details.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It's pretty hard because, as I mentioned before, so many people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious, and the Singularity flies in the face of most religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctrines.  On the other hand, people have a remarkable ability to include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictory elements into their belief systems, including their
</em><br>
religious
<br>
<em>&gt; belief systems.  There is a spiritual side to the Singularity, which has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been discussed on this list at length in the past...
</em><br>
<p>One way to avoid this problem is not to talk about sprituality at all. But
<br>
if somebody believes there's a God, then Singularity should be compatible
<br>
with that belief since this would be another God's &quot;creation&quot;, right?
<br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; I think that to excite the public about the Singularity we need to take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty different focus than the one we take among a transhumanist crowd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But what elements should we focus on?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- spirituality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- improvements to life in ways that ordinary people can understand
</em><br>
<p>Including the spirituality in the message would be dangerous. I don't think
<br>
it's necessarily the secret behind Kurzweil's message. I would much rather
<br>
appeal to the &quot;improvements to your life and world&quot; aspect, but especially,
<br>
to the humanitarian aspect of FAI in light of Singularity. Singularity
<br>
doesn't need any promotion. By itself, this event doesn't have any inherent
<br>
beneficial value to humans. It's how we make the transition safe and
<br>
beneficial to humans is what counts most. In order to make people feel good
<br>
about supporting FAI research you need to explain to them in very simple
<br>
terms how the FAI would make that transition better, and most of all, how it
<br>
would help other people. That's the most powerful appeal. The other stems
<br>
from the fact of belonging to a community of &quot;good&quot; people supporting the
<br>
research for the right reasons.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And yet, his books have not caused a major popular meme like chaos theory
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; quantum reality to emerge.  Perhaps it's just not time, in terms of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of mind if the mass psyche...
</em><br>
<p>Because his message (and others) deals with technology/science that's about
<br>
to happen, and not with trying to create the movement that would help to
<br>
make them happen. That's I think is the missing piece. FAI research is
<br>
different since it has an endless (but unused) potential to bank on the
<br>
human desire to do good. But to inspire them, one needs a carefully crafted
<br>
message that would explain to them &quot;why&quot;, and &quot;how&quot;, and then the right
<br>
strategy to get that message across which is what I mentioned earlier.
<br>

<br>
<p>P.S. BTW, here's a thought. Paul Allen provides funding to SETI. Need I say
<br>
more??
