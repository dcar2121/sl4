CS&gt; I think the Novamente approach -- more narrowly focused commercial

<em>&gt; I'm interested in any and all potential early applications for AGI - both to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have much time at the moment to sketch this in greater detail,
<br>
and my own limited notes on this are at the time unavailable.  So what
<br>
follows is *very* vague, brief and blue-sky...but it may spark some
<br>
ideas.
<br>
<p>The main thrust is the use of AI in GUIs.  There are two main aspects
<br>
to that -- modeling the computer and modeling the user -- as well as
<br>
some other features.  As a product, I envision something that sits &quot;on
<br>
top&quot; of the OS, or encapsulates it, and is always the &quot;outermost&quot;
<br>
control the user can speak to -- the ultimate arbiter, the
<br>
presidential hotline, and where the user communicates *about* what the
<br>
computer does.  (Another, somewhat less ambitious, implementation
<br>
would be specific to and sit on top of a software package such as
<br>
Microsoft Office).
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>I'm sure all of us have run into problems like the following: I was
<br>
installing a piece of software under Windows.  I have my PC set up
<br>
with all apps on E:, so I chose E: as the install drive.  It wouldn't
<br>
let me proceed because, it said, the E: drive was full.  I checked
<br>
under Explorer -- and as I thought, I had plenty of space.
<br>
<p>So what was going on?  I'm not certain -- it may have been that the
<br>
installation program was looking at total minus used space and going
<br>
by the 2GB value for total space (this was under Win95); it may have
<br>
been using variables that were too small and getting overflow...it may
<br>
have been any number of glitches.
<br>
<p>But it got me thinking -- we have two different programs (the
<br>
installer and Explorer) telling me two different things.  We have an
<br>
&quot;out of space&quot; dialog box that some programmer went to the trouble of
<br>
building, and the out-of-space check they coded for it...
<br>
<p>When you work on a modern GUI, it's really in a sense like you're
<br>
having a dialogue. You tell it to do things, and it comes back with
<br>
&quot;dialog boxes&quot; (&quot;disk too full&quot;, etc.).
<br>
<p>The problem is that you are having a dialogue with a schizophrenic
<br>
amnesiac, and what is more, one who communicates in a very inflexible,
<br>
rigid, repetitive way.
<br>
<p>As a user, I want a single, coherent, consistent conversation that
<br>
builds -- from question to question and day to day. A conversation
<br>
that makes sense. 
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>In essence what I want as a user is that the computer &quot;understands&quot;
<br>
what it is telling me.  Well, what does that mean?  That it must have
<br>
some internal representation of itself, that symbols such as &quot;hard
<br>
drive&quot; and &quot;free space&quot; must be not just strings of characters, but
<br>
have some semantic *value* -- some *referent*.
<br>
<p>I.e., the software should have an internal model of the computer in
<br>
which terms such as the above are meaningfully linked to actual values
<br>
from that model.
<br>
<p>Such a model, with some associated pseudo-natural-language processing,
<br>
may be the &quot;simpler&quot; aspect of the software -- perhaps amenable to
<br>
established technologies (DBs, natural query languages, expert
<br>
systems, etc.).
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>When I tell the computer to save my file and the disk *is* full, it
<br>
should come up with a more meaningful set of choices - it should have
<br>
some basic understanding of why I want to save a file and e.g. offer
<br>
me - do you want to clear some space or save to D: instead?
<br>
<p>Now, I have seen the above -- a dialog box asking me whether I want to
<br>
clear space -- but it, again, was something some programmer separately
<br>
designed and built code for.
<br>
<p>As a user, I want the computer to &quot;know&quot; that I want to save files,
<br>
that if space is unavailable in one place I may want to save it
<br>
elsewhere, or free space up.
<br>
<p>More fundamentally, I want to be able to teach it such things.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>This implies the software needs to have an internal evolvable model of
<br>
me, the user, as well.
<br>
<p>In the context of Microsoft Office, it would have some ideas of &quot;what
<br>
I do&quot; (create new documents and edit existing ones, type and format
<br>
stuff, print them, save them, file them, search them).  It should
<br>
learn and suggest things on its own (create &quot;wizards&quot; on the fly --
<br>
I type &quot;Dear George&quot; and it pops up with &quot;another letter to George,
<br>
'ey? Usual headings? File under 'Presidential correspondence'?&quot;)
<br>
<p>The model should evolve both under internal (user-confirmed) guesses
<br>
and under user direction.  The software should always have available
<br>
-- no matter what the user is doing -- a way for the user to interrupt
<br>
and tell it to &quot;go meta&quot;.  By this I mean a way for the user to tell
<br>
the software &quot;Now watch what I'm doing...whenever I do X, I want you
<br>
to do Y and Z.&quot; or &quot;See that dialog that popped up?  Always click &quot;No&quot;
<br>
on that one.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here's where the model gets more complex, because it needs to deal
<br>
with analogies.  &quot;See how I'm taking each of the sentences from this
<br>
paragraph and making them bullet points?  Do it for the rest of the
<br>
paragraph.&quot; is relatively simple.  &quot;Do the same thing to this line
<br>
chart.&quot; is more complex (what is &quot;the same thing&quot;?  Does each series
<br>
(line) get split into its own chart?  Each year?).  This is also the
<br>
point in the model where an ongoing dialogue becomes most important --
<br>
being able to correct the assumptions and guesses the software makes,
<br>
such corrections getting folded back into the model.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>The language used to describe the internal structures of the computer
<br>
and its software, actions associated with them, etc. should allow for
<br>
sharing between users.  In other words, once one user has &quot;told&quot; the
<br>
system about what PhotoShop does (via interactive querying by the
<br>
software, details too long to go into), others wouldn't need to.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>So, vague and scatter-shot.  There's a lot left out of the above and
<br>
when I can dig up all my notes and have the time, I might put together a
<br>
more coherent and detailed presentation of this; the AGI list is
<br>
probably a more suitable venue.
<br>
<p>The reason I see this as a viable application for (early) AGI is
<br>
because on the one hand it requires limited, quantifiable, shareable
<br>
knowledge (domain expertise about software combined with the ability
<br>
to intercept both user events and OS API calls) and on the other,
<br>
provides an &quot;evolution-driving&quot; environment: the user's requirements.
<br>
<p>There is IMO a widespread need for such tech in user interfaces, thus
<br>
plenty of people who would want to use it.  And possibly, if this or
<br>
some variant on it was structured in the right way (perhaps dealing
<br>
with the browsing experience, say), a huge number of users could be
<br>
leveraged to drastically accelerate the evolution of the software.
