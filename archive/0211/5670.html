I am fairly new to the list, but I have been working on Friendly AI for
<br>
many years.  I hate to see the same money problems here that I have been
<br>
watching over the last several months in the Alice  foundation.
<br>
<p>I think you are on the right track to fund raising on this thread
<br>
though.
<br>
<p>Donors need to feel involved in the project.  There needs to be a shared
<br>
sense of accomplishment and accountability in terms of what's being
<br>
done.
<br>
<p>I would be less interested in seeing a blog than seeing a well
<br>
maintained project plan in enough detail to show me that the research
<br>
plan is in fact concrete enough that it can be broken into definable
<br>
steps with periodic milestones.
<br>
<p>This has the added benefit of allowing volunteers to step up to specific
<br>
tasks and perhaps donating skill and expertise as well as money.
<br>
<p>I realize that research efforts often cannot be specific as to when or
<br>
if a given long-term objective will be accomplished, but the project
<br>
plan could list immediate 1-3 month goals, medium range goals 4-12 month
<br>
goals and long term.
<br>
<p>I am fairly new to the list and have read some postings regarding ethics
<br>
of the AI, some regarding the funding, but thus far nothing has really
<br>
demonstrated to me how this large project is to be attacked.
<br>
<p>I must admit I am not in the position to donate much in the way of
<br>
financial funding myself right now.
<br>
My research is self-funded and I am approaching the bottom of the barrel
<br>
also and will need full-time employment to continue my research.
<br>
<p>Let me bring up another funding idea though.  Think of some aspect of
<br>
the early project phases that could be made interesting to National
<br>
Science Foundation.  It sounds like some of the principles here may have
<br>
the scientific credentials to pull off an NSF grant.  Doing a grant
<br>
proposal does require enough of a plan to instill credibility but then
<br>
so does fundraising, 
<br>

<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; return, that researcher sets up a blog that they update everyday to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let it be known what they did.  Even if there's no interesting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research to report, they might just write up some interesting personal
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; anecdote for the day.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is a good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many people like that kind of personal connection with another person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they could see that their money is going somewhere, even if it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just to get a couple of paragraphs of quickly written prose from one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the more interesting people on the planet.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly. Websites that are not being frequently updated are such a turn
<br>
off.
<br>
<p>Also, what I think needs to happen here is for as many potential
<br>
individual donors as possible to become aware of the Singularity and
<br>
SIAI's research. I mean all people with, let's say, more than a 1M$ in
<br>
the bank. I don't think it's time to be picky and rely exclusively on
<br>
the residents of Silicon Valley to provide the funding.
<br>
<p>How can those people be reached? Well, not really through internet. One
<br>
solution might be publishing either CFAI (perhaps, with some more
<br>
accessible
<br>
language) or something else, and further promotion. I might have some
<br>
ideas where.
<br>
<p>My other ideas are totally &quot;off the wall&quot; so it might not be a good idea
<br>
to reveal them just yet.
