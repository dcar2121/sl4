<p>
In various discussions of super-AIs arguments get made that imply a
<br>
good or even perfect ability to predict human or other sentient
<br>
behaviour.
<br>
<p>If such prediction is based on simulation, at what level of detail
<br>
does it cross an ethical line?  That is to say, if the simulation is
<br>
fine-grained enough to accurately simulate a number of sentients,
<br>
&quot;are&quot; those sentients &quot;really&quot; aware?
<br>
<p>This may sound like a philosophical question as semantically empty as
<br>
the tree-in-a-forest-making-sound one.  But I would assume that many
<br>
(most?) on this list believe that a &quot;perfect&quot; simulation would indeed
<br>
have consciousness, i.e. that awareness is irrelevant of the hardware
<br>
substrate it's running on, that John Searle's Chinese Room thought
<br>
experiment is fatally flawed, etc.
<br>
<p>But if that's the case, and if it's the case that for a simulation to
<br>
be accurate enough, it must approach emulation (because of the initial
<br>
condition sensitivity / chaotic dynamics involved), then for the AI to
<br>
predict/calculate the moral or ethical implications of its actions
<br>
becomes in itself an action with moral and ethical implications.
<br>
&quot;Would Action X cause suffering?&quot; would require running a simulation
<br>
that could cause that suffering to the sentients within the
<br>
simulation.
<br>
<p>IIRC, Stanislaw Lem touches upon this in one of the stories in _The
<br>
Cyberiad_, although from a different perspective.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'm missing something.  What are the alternate paths towards
<br>
prediction and analysis?  Has this issue been discussed here before?
