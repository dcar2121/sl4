Dear Ben Goertzel (and SL4)
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>

<em>&gt; Michael, as I see it, ethical/moral values cannot be tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; according to &quot;how usefully they describe reality.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are prescriptive rather than descriptive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>There are two separate 'questions' here that can become confused if
<br>
mixed. Firstly there is question if whether ethical/moral values can
<br>
be tested against reality. Secondly there is the question as to
<br>
whether they are prescriptive or descriptive.
<br>
<p>For the first... I am positing that moral Rightness is an *absolute*
<br>
quality of the universe, therefore if you are correct in saying that
<br>
ethical/moral values cannot be tested against reality, then my whole
<br>
argument falls. Indeed, if you are correct, then *any* argument that
<br>
suggests there is absolute right and wrong will fall, and all
<br>
morality is arbitrary - merely a random side-effect of human social
<br>
consciousness. I suggest that any action taken by a sentience can be
<br>
judged against this absolute value, by the sentience itself, viewed
<br>
through a window of ver own intelligence and understanding of the
<br>
situation. This implies that a variety of Rightness judgements made
<br>
by any given set of independent sentients, starting off with
<br>
differing 'windows', will gradually converge as intelligence and
<br>
situational-knowledge increase. This 'convergence' is mentioned in
<br>
Eliezer's work (peripherally) and I have been uncomfortable with the
<br>
idea. However, if we are to create a self-enhancing machine that will
<br>
outstrip us in every way, including ethical and moral values, then it
<br>
simply due-diligence to attempt to understand in what direction it
<br>
will develop *eventually*, and give it a good head-start in that
<br>
direction. Thus: Friendly AI. The thing is, Friendly AI has to be
<br>
Right... not just for us, but for whatever we might become in the
<br>
future as well. It has to be Right, not only for our biosphere, but
<br>
for any other life we find in the universe also. Its a tall order, to
<br>
*have* to be Right. But there is no point shying away from the
<br>
question... that won't help anyone. Sorry for the melodrama... but
<br>
sometimes things have to be said - so they are not forgotten.
<br>
<p>For the second... moral values can be both prescriptive (thou shalt
<br>
not murder) and descriptive (murder hurts the community). I have no
<br>
interest in prescriptive morality... I'll leave that to religions and
<br>
lawmakers. The descriptive kind of morality is what I'm interested
<br>
in. What morals work to achieve our goals? How is a given ethic
<br>
useful? These are more interesting and pertinent questions to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, some ethical/moral systems could be logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inconsistent -- that is one way of narrowing down the set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all possible ethical/moral systems ... iff one believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that ethical/moral systems *should* be  logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent. Most human ethical/moral systems don't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me to be very logically consistent...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you are correct, then is HIGH TIME that we made a logically
<br>
consistent, and empirically verifiable ethical/moral system. If
<br>
Friendly AI isn't it, then I'm betting on the wrong horse.
