<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yeah.  Heh.  Its what everyone wants, but nobody has.  Do we ground
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our morals in the views of one person?  A whole bunch of people?  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a measure of some situation?  Or what?  Currently morals seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grounded in concensus opinion, and as such, Friendly AI's cloud of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pan-human characteristics would attempt to capture that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It should be grounded in what is actually the best acheivable by the 
<br>
sentients concerned.  Not best in terms of something outside themselves 
<br>
but in the context of themselves.  Morality only exist in that context. 
<br>
&nbsp;It is a tool for choosing between alternatives.  Such choices can only 
<br>
be made with a context.  Speaking of Morality as separate from context 
<br>
is pointless. It is not simply a matter of consensus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sure.  It's nothing fancy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;First, one has to define the goal.  Here are some examples of goals:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To get to heaven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To be considered a good person by oneself and others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To perpetuate the human species.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To increase the quantity and quality of sentience in this Galaxy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;To increase in complexity of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Second, one has to define the system that is intended to reach (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;move towards) a goal.  Here are some examples of systems:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Christianity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Humanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Buddhism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Complexitism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The system is irrelevant to formulate the funamental goal.  It is means, 
<br>
not end.  It is subject to continual re-evaluation relative to the ends 
<br>
chosen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Third, you compare how well actions take within the system move
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toward (or reach) the goal.  If actions within the system do in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;achieve the goal, then the system is verified.  Otherwise it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refuted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You are mixing systems in arbitrarily it seems to me.  It adds nothing 
<br>
and actually detracts from the discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I ask myself &quot;what is the most Right goal&quot;? or &quot;what goal encompasses
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all the other Right goals?&quot;.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Why do you ask such an utterly abstract question in the first place? 
<br>
&nbsp;What good is in that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Then I ask myself &quot;what has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe been doing up to now? (that we know of)&quot;.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The universe hasn't been doing anyting in terms of conscious choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And one answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;appeared to be 'Increasing in complexity'.  This seems to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answer the Universe is giving us when we ask &quot;what are you doing?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is highly confused as it addressed and inanimate and/or unconscious 
<br>
or inaccesible-if-conscious aggregate as if it is conscious and 
<br>
accessibly so and as if what it is &quot;doing&quot; is at all relevant to what is 
<br>
the best basis for a moral system for us here and now.  What for?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This answer correlates well with many of the human moral systems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have grown and prospered over the centuries.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No, it doesn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even now we, as humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are attempting to push the complexity of our environment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ourselves to ever greater heights.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is not the primary goal or center of morality though.  It is a 
<br>
by-product.  It cannot be made the primary goal meaningfully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This seems to be what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe *does*, and as such, I suspect it is the Right thing to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That does not follow.   Nor is there any reason to beleive there is any 
<br>
absolute Right thing outside of relevant context.  Simply taking the 
<br>
biggest context possible and anthromorphisizing the hell out of it 
<br>
hardly gives an absolute Right.
