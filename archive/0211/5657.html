Well, that is a major bummer, Brian ;-(
<br>
<p>The last few years have been hard economically on a lot of us, obviously.
<br>
<p>I wonder if perhaps this event can catalyze some creative thinking on the
<br>
part of some of the bright minds on this list, regarding strategies for
<br>
raising funds for Singularity-oriented work.
<br>
<p>Heck, I would certainly love to have some funds for pure, noncommercial,
<br>
Singularity-oriented AGI R&amp;D work.  I can't really complain about my current
<br>
personal situation, as I feel quite privileged to be getting paid to work on
<br>
Novamente-based commercial narrow-AI apps (as opposed to pumping gas, or
<br>
writing multi-tier DB systems, or designing weapons, etc. etc.).  But it
<br>
would be *also* great to have funds to pay software engineers to implement
<br>
and test some of the less commercially relevant but highly AGI-relevant
<br>
aspects of Novamente.  That stuff is now getting done by a small team of
<br>
excellent &amp; dedicated volunteers, but it's not getting done nearly as fast
<br>
as it could be...
<br>
<p>The US gov't will put $37 billion into antibiowarfare in 2003, but
<br>
essentially $0 into AGI.  Funny, that....  But short-term thinking on the
<br>
part of industry and gov't is not a new story.
<br>
<p>Fortunately, other Singularity-pointing research areas, like nanotech and
<br>
biotech and computer hardware, are getting a lot more moola.  Yet AGI, which
<br>
is arguably the most central area of Singularity-ward work, is chronically
<br>
starved of resources....
<br>
<p>If 100 million people could be convinced to put $1/year into AGI, that would
<br>
give us $100M/yr. annual funding for AGI research.  Not too much to ask, for
<br>
something of such incredible importance in so many ways, eh?
<br>
<p>Any creative, off-the-wall ideas about how to turn the general funding
<br>
situation around?
<br>
<p>Get Eliezer to debate Dubya on Oprah???  '-)

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hello all. I'm sorry to announce that due to a long series of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financial issues, Sabine and I will no longer be able to support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity Institute materially. We will of course continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-material means of support, including remaining members of the board
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of directors. I do want to stress that this action is taken solely due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to our finances, and not out of any change in our viewpoint that SIAI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well worth helping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just to be clear, this should not affect SIAI's plans, or the donations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has accumulated (and continues to accumulate) in its main fund. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only effect will be that Eliezer's research fellowship is now going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to find alternate means of funding. Assuming that funding can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found then things will continue as before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer will follow up with more information about his own situation.
