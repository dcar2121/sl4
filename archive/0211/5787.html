<p>Well, I'll grant you that there is another school of 'thought', which
<br>
explicitly rejects any attempt to understand or justify the rules of an
<br>
ethical system in favor of blind faith in some higher authority. But even
<br>
then, the reason people accept such systems is usually an underlying
<br>
expectation that they will promote whatever it is they consider good, and
<br>
restrain whatever they consider bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Your loose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description is a good start... now we just have to fill in all those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pesky definitions for words like 'significant', 'positive/negative'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 'outcomes' ;)
</em><br>
<p>Heavens, no. If you want to approach ethics as an objective, scientific
<br>
problem the last thing you want to do is make unsupported assumptions about
<br>
anything. You certainly can't justify assuming that your own values are more
<br>
correct than anyone else's, or that you have a better grasp of who matters
<br>
than some other group does - the very fact that there is disagreement on
<br>
these points is a sure sighn that you need hard data before you can come to
<br>
any conclusions.
<br>
<p>That's why I started by suggesting a calculation where each person rates the
<br>
desireability of a possible future by its own standards, and you look at
<br>
everything capable of having an opinion. Spend some time studying that kind
<br>
of simulation and you might be able to identify entities you can safely
<br>
ignore, or rating systems that don't work for one reason or another. But the
<br>
data has to come first, and it has to be interpreted independantly of any
<br>
one person's preconceived notions of what the final result 'ought' to be.
<br>
Otherwise you're just manufacturing excuses for whatever ethical system you
<br>
started out with.
