<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, in order to create a message that would resonate with people, one
</em><br>
needs
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to put a good spin on Singularity. Instead of talking about Jupiter
</em><br>
Brains,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Transition Guides, Singularitarianism, or boring AI technical details
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might just as well say something like &quot;FAI could help to cure cancer and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aids&quot;, &quot;FAI would be helpful in figuring out your material problems&quot;, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that &quot;FAI could save people from dying&quot;. That's basically how the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nanotechnology gets &quot;sold&quot; to the masses. And since FAI could do
</em><br>
nanotech,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well........ you get the idea. If anybody is interested enough, the FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; websites would provide the further details.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dumbing down the Singularity for &quot;the masses&quot;... is that really what an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI would do?
</em><br>
<p>No, but why do you have to do what FAI would do? This has nothing to do with
<br>
programming FAI. This is about getting the funds to start building FAI in
<br>
the first place. Or at least I think so.
<br>
<p>Putting a spin on Singularity doesn't mean dumbing it for the masses at all.
<br>
The meaning of &quot;spin&quot; in this case is being very careful with how much shock
<br>
is applied to your audience. And the shock applied not to masses, but to
<br>
very
<br>
few people with the ability to support the project. Any mass movement is
<br>
both unrealistic and unnecessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It doesn't seem very compassionate.  Or very honest.  Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very effective.
</em><br>
<p>Scaring people is unnecessary and definitely not more effective. Providing
<br>
less, but still true, information doesn't make your message a lie.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have seen newbie Singularitarians try to spin the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity for what they fondly imagine to be the lowest common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denominator, and I have never once seen that trick work.  All that happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that the real message - the message that originally produced the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarian - is lost out in a morass of unconnected technical details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unsupported noncredible assertions.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're saying things that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genuinely believe, somewhere in there will be things that even other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people may find to be worth believing.  If you're trying to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulative, saying things you think are real clever and that will really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pander to those stupid masses, you will make amateurish manipulative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements that will instantly be filtered out by an audience trained to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resist the highly experienced manipulation of the trained professionals.
</em><br>
<p>Well, religion seems to be pretty successful at implementing those tactics.
<br>
Actually, people will believe in anything. But why would you have to
<br>
manipulate people to get what you want in the first place? The right, but
<br>
true, message will do. This is not a religion or politics where you need to
<br>
know how to manipulate people. Masses are not necessary either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is the solution to get more practice at manipulating people?  No.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high a competence at manipulation takes too much evil.  There's no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those skills could be employed at that level while keeping the essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message of the Singularity intact.  Remember that we are not here to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves famous.  We are here for the Singularity.  If you make yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; famous and lose the Singularity that is anti-progress.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure whether Singularity contains any message or that this message,
<br>
if it exists, needs to remain intact for some reason. It's just merely a
<br>
word trying to describe the series of events due to accelerated progress of
<br>
technology. Like any other event it has no message. Singularity itself is
<br>
not the goal. Well being of humanity faced with inevitable Singularity is.
<br>
Humanity doesn't need Singularity, or superficial theories designed around
<br>
it. Again, this is not a religion or politics. All efforts trying to protect
<br>
that theory are just waste of time that could be spent on trying to
<br>
accomplish something of real value to humanity. These efforts would be a
<br>
real anti-progress.
