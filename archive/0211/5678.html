<p>BG&gt; Why did &quot;chaos theory&quot; achieve the status it has, in the popular mind?
<br>
<p>FractInt.
<br>
<p>At least in my case and that of others I know, having a basic
<br>
understanding of the math involved, and then being able to explore the
<br>
Mandelbrot set interactively, is what truly impressed me.  (Well,
<br>
articles and color plates drew me in initially, but did not have as
<br>
large an impact).
<br>
<p>There's also the intuitive &quot;understanding&quot; in the popular mind, but
<br>
that might be better described as intuitive &quot;acceptance&quot;.  There's
<br>
more of an actual understanding in the popular Geek mind, say the
<br>
Slashdot and above crowd.
<br>
<p>As far as popularizing the Singularity meme, I agree that it may be
<br>
too early, zeitgeist-wise.  Nanotech is at this stage more easily
<br>
visualized, and has seen quite a bit of popularization -- Neal
<br>
Stephenson's The Diamond Age has had quite an impact there, IMO
<br>
(although I don't think it's accurate as a prediction of nanotech's
<br>
effects; not that it's intended to be).
<br>
<p>I think a better case can be made for AGI at this point than for the
<br>
Singularity.  A(G)I's effects can be described in far more concrete and
<br>
accessible ways -- the &quot;Because Artificial Stupidity Costs Lives&quot; PR
<br>
campaign I alluded to in my last post is only half tongue-in-cheek.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how that translates into donations.  Perhaps a tie-in
<br>
with security efforts of some sort -- web/virus security, airline
<br>
security -- could produce (pressure for) government funding, but then
<br>
you're quickly into military/industrial applications.
<br>
<p>Of course, AI does suffer from the legacy problem -- the numerous
<br>
overhyped promises that never panned out.  To some extent, computers
<br>
in general have been tainted with a similar brush (paperless office,
<br>
Net bubble, an endless array of Microsoft IntelliX/AutoX/SmartX
<br>
technologies).  Any popularization would have to show some, perhaps 
<br>
small, thing that works impressively right now.
<br>
<p>I think the Novamente approach -- more narrowly focused commercial
<br>
efforts -- are a very good approach to funding currently.  I do have
<br>
a long-simmering but vague-in-details idea for some AI tech that
<br>
Novamente at its current stage may or may not be suited to, which
<br>
if implemented as a software package could be quite popular.
