</em><br>
<p>I think that if someone can't understand a simple coordinate graph, they're
<br>
unlikely to be convinced by a website full of discussions of science and
<br>
engineering news trends, either.  For people below a certain education
<br>
level, we need &quot;Singularity: The Movie&quot; instead.  But the production costs
<br>
there are a lot greater than plotting a few graphs... ;)
<br>
<p>I always remember watching Ronnie Reagan on TV during his presidential days.
<br>
He was a huge fan of graphs, charts and statistics.  You got the feeling
<br>
*he* barely understood some of them, but they were damn convincing to his
<br>
audience, most of whom probably didn't fully understand most of them either.
<br>
<p>Clinton on the other hand rarely used such visuals, in spite of being a
<br>
vastly more intellectual guy.  Go figure....
<br>
<p>Anyway, not surprisingly I agree with Reason.
<br>
<p>Ever see Kurzweil give his presentation on the Singularity.  It's all
<br>
graphs.  They make the audience's jaws drop ... then he starts in with the
<br>
explanations, once the graphs have them receptive.  Admittedly, it's a
<br>
fairly techie audience; but even so, he has trouble getting the message
<br>
across, not because the graphs are hard to understand, but because of the
<br>
startling nature of the message.

<p>I agree that the graphs are going to be the hardest part of the proposed
<br>
project, Web development wise.
<br>
<p>The hardest part of the project overall will probably be keeping the site
<br>
going based on volunteer effort -- keeping the volunteers enthused and
<br>
reliable, finding new ones when some of the originals get tired or aren't
<br>
reliable enough, etc.  But that comes after the Web development part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Nice idea. I think that what-is-the-singularity.org would be a good thing
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt;have out there, and I'd be happy to volunteer a little web dev time at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point to such a project.
</em><br>
<p>That's great.  I will keep a list of people who are interesting in helping
<br>
out with such a project assuming it's seriously initiated.
<br>
<p>What I'm really hoping, however, is that someone else will volunteer to not
<br>
only help out but effectively project-manage the thing [perhaps contributing
<br>
new ideas as well] ;).  Novamente takes a LOT of time as you might imagine
<br>
!!
<br>
<p>I agree that what-is-the-singularity.org is better than Singularity Report
<br>
... I wish it were shorter though? [the familiar domain name dilemma...]
