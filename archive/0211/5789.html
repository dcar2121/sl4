Dear Samantha,
<br>
<p>You wrote:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not best in terms of something outside themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but in the context of themselves.  Morality only exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>When one considers e/m systems in terms of the sentients concerned,
<br>
and in that context *alone*, I think there is something missing from
<br>
the 'equation'.  Defining what is &quot;best&quot; is going to be a matter of
<br>
opinion, unless &quot;best&quot; is grounded in reality in some way.  I would
<br>
guess that there are many ways of accomplishing such a grounding... I
<br>
proposed my 'measure' (Rightness) as one possible way.  I'm looking
<br>
for others as well.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are mixing systems in arbitrarily it seems to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It adds nothing and actually detracts from the discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the topic is about a system (or systems) and how well (or
<br>
badly) they might work.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is highly confused as it addressed and inanimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or unconscious or inaccesible-if-conscious aggregate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as if it is conscious and accessibly so and as if what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;doing&quot; is at all relevant to what is the best basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a moral system for us here and now.  What for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ahh... a turn-of-phrase:
<br>
&quot;I asked the &lt;inanimate-object&gt;...&quot; means I observed, studied,
<br>
reasearched, questioned-myself-about the &lt;inanimate-object&gt;.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Even now we, as humans, are attempting to push the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;complexity of our environment and ourselves to ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;greater heights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not the primary goal or center of morality though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a by-product.  It cannot be made the primary goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningfully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh, well of course nothing should be *made* the primary goal, I would
<br>
never think of forcing anyone... but I am attempting to come up with
<br>
a useful definition, a measure.  It wouldn't have to be the only (or
<br>
even primary) measure.  The question I am trying to answer is: is it
<br>
a useful one?  Would it help us understand difficult moral situations
<br>
with greater ease?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Testability is a separate issue from moral absoluteness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On what grounds would you posit that Rightness is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal absolute?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, while testability and moral absoluteness *are* separate issues,
<br>
I would like to find a way of *testing* a set of morals to see if
<br>
they are as right as can be.  If such a thing can't be done, then...
<br>
well... shucks!  But there is no harm in trying :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not at all obvious that a brand-spanking new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI has to be [R]ight for all sentients for all time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will be quite satisfied if it maximizes the local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence quotient and insures room for us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survive and grow.  That is quite sufficient for now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I would also be very satisfied with that situation... we would have
<br>
*made it*.  Although, I can easily imagine myself asking and FAI: &quot;In
<br>
what direction will you improve your ethical/moral system?&quot;  &quot;How
<br>
will you know your new system is better than the old one?&quot;  &quot;By what
<br>
measure or measures will you compare the systems?&quot;
