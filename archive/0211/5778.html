Dear Ben,
<br>
<p>You wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now you are positing a concrete meta-goal:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ** Find out the universe's implicit goal system, and adopt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a goal system as close as possible to the universe's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implicit goal system **
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Good summary.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why is this meta-goal better than some other one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is still, ultimately, a basic choice being made...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, a valid question.  I rephrase the current meta-goal choice
<br>
question as 'how much shall I pay attention to reality?'.  I choose
<br>
to answer: as much as I can.  The place where this gets *really*
<br>
interesting is the self-referential aspect.  Because we are a
<br>
sentient part of the universe it is possible for us to consciously
<br>
choose the path for ouselves, and as such for part of the universe
<br>
also.  It may even be possible eventually to change the implicit goal
<br>
system of the universe entirely!  The universe could then be said to
<br>
be 'remaking itself'.  Unfortunately, we are currently a) a *very*
<br>
tiny speck in the universe and b) almost powerless to change the
<br>
course of anything.  Though our situational knowledge seems to be
<br>
improving nicely, our intelligence is capped while stuck on the
<br>
current bio-platform.  This causes our knowable window of Rightness
<br>
to be distressingly narrow.   Even so, we can study history and try
<br>
and draw conclusions.  We can study the universe and try and draw
<br>
conclusions from it.  One of my conclusions is the definition of
<br>
Rightness.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are we really helping it by helping it &quot;achieve its goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even better&quot;???  Paradoxes of free will seem to lurk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside your meta-goal....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is no paradox to help oneself while at the same time helping a
<br>
larger system that you are a part of.  In fact, in a way, that is my
<br>
point.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I do have a goal of increasing the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complexity &amp; pattern in the universe, AND a goal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserving human &amp; sentient life.... And I'm not so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure about your meta-goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This very closely describes my goal system at this time, with the
<br>
added overriding additional requirement that I NOT DIE.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My son Zeb asked my dad once &quot;Ted, do you like me more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the universe?&quot; Ted said ... &quot;Hmmm.  yeah, I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to choose you Zeb.  When you think about it, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is kind of a mixed bag...&quot;  ;-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Cute story.  Your kids sound smart :)  For my son (who is just a
<br>
glint right now) I imagine myself answering: &quot;Hmmm. Son, you are a
<br>
part of the universe, right?, so loving you is like loving special
<br>
part of the universe.  Its a two-fer!&quot;
<br>
