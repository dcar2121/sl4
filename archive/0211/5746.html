</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>

Memory is apparently short in the fast lane, but here are some reminders
<br>
that might be relevant to this discussion:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/programsales/programs/s346659.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/programsales/programs/s346659.htm</a>

<br>
links to a 2001 Aussie TV series explicitly about the Singularity. It's not
<br>
terribly good, but it happened. People in other countries might consider
<br>
getting it onto their own screens.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Several eps of that program explicitly used my shorthand term `the Spike',
<br>
which reminds me that, hey, there's been a book of that title available
<br>
since 1997 that deals exclusively with our topic. The US edition, from
<br>
Tor/Forge, came out in 2001, and the trade paperback has been around since
<br>
February this year. I'm told it has not yet sold out its advance: that is,
<br>
only a modest number of copies have been purchased in the States. People
<br>
eager to promote the Singularity might consider starting there. I admit
<br>
there might be some resentment at my use of a neologism for the ancient,
<br>
carved-in-stone term `Singularity', but I felt that `the Spike' might have
<br>
a snappier media-friendly feel to it. At this point I don't know, but it's
<br>
worth considering. (It's been adopted in, e.g., the new space opera trilogy
<br>
by Sean Williams and Shane Dix.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
BTW, there's also the outreach-to-the-academy aspect. Next month a book
<br>
will be released by the (wonderfully appropriately named) Power Institute
<br>
in Oz, PREFIGURING CYBERCULTURE (Eds. Darren Tofts, Annemarie Jonson and
<br>
Alessio Cavallaro), with a long chapter by me on the Singularity; it will
<br>
also be released in hardcover next March by MIT Press.
