<em>&gt;&gt;It [ethical/moral system] should be grounded in what is

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Not best in terms of something outside themselves

<em>&gt;&gt;in that context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When one considers e/m systems in terms of the sentients concerned,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'equation'.  Defining what is &quot;best&quot; is going to be a matter of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess that there are many ways of accomplishing such a grounding... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed my 'measure' (Rightness) as one possible way.  I'm looking
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Well yes and no.  But the most important part of that grounding 
<br>
is the context of the sapients the e/m system is for.  You 
<br>
cannot define &quot;best&quot; in any meaningful way without that context. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reality is what it is including the reality of the real 
<br>
nature and needs of said sapients.  There are no ways of 
<br>
grounding such systems that don't start with and build on that 
<br>
reality.  &quot;Rightness&quot; is not a standalone or context-free 
<br>
quality or existent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This is highly confused as it addressed and inanimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;and/or unconscious or inaccesible-if-conscious aggregate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as if it is conscious and accessibly so and as if what it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is &quot;doing&quot; is at all relevant to what is the best basis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for a moral system for us here and now.  What for?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ahh... a turn-of-phrase:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I asked the &lt;inanimate-object&gt;...&quot; means I observed, studied,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasearched, questioned-myself-about the &lt;inanimate-object&gt;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>But you use language about said inanimate object that is only 
<br>
appropriate for systems capable of conscious choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;Even now we, as humans, are attempting to push the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;complexity of our environment and ourselves to ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;greater heights.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This is not the primary goal or center of morality though.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It is a by-product.  It cannot be made the primary goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;meaningfully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, well of course nothing should be *made* the primary goal, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never think of forcing anyone... but I am attempting to come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful definition, a measure.  It wouldn't have to be the only (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even primary) measure.  The question I am trying to answer is: is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful one?  Would it help us understand difficult moral situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with greater ease?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Complexity as such is no meaningful measure of &quot;rightness&quot; at 
<br>
all. It certainly will not help us make moral decisions, 
<br>
difficult or otherwise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Testability is a separate issue from moral absoluteness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;On what grounds would you posit that Rightness is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;universal absolute?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, while testability and moral absoluteness *are* separate issues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would like to find a way of *testing* a set of morals to see if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are as right as can be.  If such a thing can't be done, then...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well... shucks!  But there is no harm in trying :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a search for the Philosopher's Stone to me.  But 
<br>
hey, best of luck.  :-)  The only way I know to test sets of 
<br>
morals is in the context of the parts of reality relevant to 
<br>
judging moral systems which very much includes the sapients 
<br>
affected and attempting to use the e/m system to guide their 
<br>
choices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;It is not at all obvious that a brand-spanking new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;FAI has to be [R]ight for all sentients for all time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I will be quite satisfied if it maximizes the local
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;intelligence quotient and insures room for us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;survive and grow.  That is quite sufficient for now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would also be very satisfied with that situation... we would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *made it*.  Although, I can easily imagine myself asking and FAI: &quot;In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what direction will you improve your ethical/moral system?&quot;  &quot;How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will you know your new system is better than the old one?&quot;  &quot;By what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure or measures will you compare the systems?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>That seems reasonable.
