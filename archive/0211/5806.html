<em>&gt; Samantha Atkins:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Complexity as such is no meaningful measure of &quot;rightness&quot; at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all. It certainly will not help us make moral decisions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; difficult or otherwise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My sense is that a &quot;higher&quot; ethics or morality does have some relation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to increasing complexity (or consciousness or intelligence).  On an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitive or perhaps esthetic level I feel this is the &quot;purpose&quot; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience -- although I wouldn't propose that as an objective,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurable reality.
</em><br>
<p>In the search for higher level meaning, for a moral system that is a closer
<br>
approximation to &quot;universal truth&quot;, the overarching measure of goodness is
<br>
consistency.
<br>
<p>Evaluating consistency is inevitably a successive approximation scenario.
<br>
Just as a parent's concepts are are (generally) broader than a child's.
<br>
(Speaking in general, as this group of gifted children know from
<br>
experience.)
<br>
<p>The best we can do in our search for a rational moral system is the
<br>
following:
<br>
To a backgound of consistency (a growing approximation of &quot;universal truth&quot;)
<br>
we apply values that are local (limited context) to arrive at our (current)
<br>
goals.
<br>
<p>What may be disconcerting to some is that conventional human values are not
<br>
central to the larger moral system.
<br>
<p>- Jef
