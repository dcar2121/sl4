<p>Yes, it will be expensive.  But one can limit the amount of data that needs to 
<br>
be processed in various ways.  One was is by converting pixelated images into 
<br>
vector images.  This has the additional advantage if rendering itself 
<br>
independant of scale.  One way is by keeping a chronfile index.  This lets 
<br>
you filter out anything that happened at an inappropriate time.  One way is 
<br>
by indexing the imagery with various feature codes.  Again, this allows for 
<br>
lots of stuff to be filtered out.  And finally composit objects (almost 
<br>
everything) should have some kind of fancy hashing algorithm, to allow 
<br>
filtering out of anything that didn't have the appropriate features.
<br>
This would allow one to retrieve, e.g., only images that had a red circle and 
<br>
a blue square relatively cheaply.
<br>
<p>This entire image would then be input into a model that indicated the 3-D 
<br>
relationships between the parts, and this would be what was stored.  
<br>
Otherwise perspective can seriously damage the ability to associate similar 
<br>
images.  But note that the model has lost a lot of detail along the way.  It 
<br>
is instances of this model that are indexed.  And the model allows additional 
<br>
data to be added as time goes by.  E.g., when you first see someone's back, 
<br>
that information is used to update the model that you had of their front.  
<br>
Ditto for side views.  Not a simple process, but a lot less computationally 
<br>
expensive than, say, ray-tracing.
<br>
<p>Also, somehow the pieces of this model will need to be able to be extracted 
<br>
and named separately.  E.g., a huge plaster hand is seen to be the same (in 
<br>
some sense) as the thing at the end of your wrist.  This is because of the 
<br>
ability of the various gross features to be put into a &quot;sort of&quot; one-to-one 
<br>
relationship.  It has fingers is more important than, e.g., how many fingers 
<br>
it has.  Again, within limits.  And we clearly understand (model) the deep 
<br>
connection between a left hand and a right hand.  So this probably means that 
<br>
most of their model is shared.
<br>
<p>Perhaps what I'm saying is that imagery is rarely directly compared with other 
<br>
imagery.  What are compared are the models via which they are understood.
<br>
<p>N.B.:  A lot of work would need to be done during the original conversion of 
<br>
pixelated images to vectors.  You probably need not just basic shape codes, 
<br>
but also surface texture codes.  You probably shouldn't expect to get enough 
<br>
information to code things properly out of just one still image.  You are 
<br>
likely to need to know how things normally move in relation to each other, so 
<br>
that you can determine natural boundaries.  Also stereoscopic images are 
<br>
quite useful in determining how the bumps and hollows of the surface work.  
<br>
(Camoflage is used to render simple color based assumptions ... dubious.)
