Hi,
<br>
<p>First of all, I definitely think Eliezer is taking the right course in his
<br>
serious fund-raising activity.
<br>
<p>SIAI is too far-out for almost any research or humanitarian nonprofit to
<br>
fund.  Of course, nothing can ever be ruled out entirely -- a &quot;lucky find&quot;
<br>
is always possible.  But by far the likeliest option, as Eliezer says, is
<br>
for another individual philanthropist to step in.  The amount being
<br>
requested is really quite modest.
<br>
<p>Having gotten that out of the way, though, I do think it's interesting to
<br>
explore more creative and speculative means of raising funds for AGI and
<br>
other Singularity-related work...
<br>
<p>Cliff suggested:
<br>
<em>&gt; A $10 per ticket You Get To Be God lottery (easier to make money off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the less intelligent/wealthy many -- they needn't know everybody ends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up winning...)?
</em><br>
<p>I quite like this one.  Very funny.  Raffle off chances to be the first
<br>
upload... There's definitely a funky sci-fi story there, if there hasn't
<br>
been one already written on the theme...
<br>
<p>Cliff, your point about selling people pieces of the moon is interesting
<br>
though.  The underlying motivation there is that people like to have some
<br>
personal connection with what they're paying for.
<br>
<p>Just as getting people to pay for Third World children is easier if it's set
<br>
up so that each person is sponsoring *one particular* child, who they can
<br>
get a letter from every year.
<br>
<p>I wonder if they're a good way to &quot;personalize&quot; peoples' connections with
<br>
AGI, in a similar way.  We can't have each person sponsor their own AGI, of
<br>
course -- that will be reserved for the *really big* donations ;-p
<br>
