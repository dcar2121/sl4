Dear Ben,
<br>
<p>You wrote:

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yeah.  Heh.  Its what everyone wants, but nobody has.  Do we ground
<br>
our morals in the views of one person?  A whole bunch of people?  In
<br>
a measure of some situation?  Or what?  Currently morals seem to be
<br>
grounded in concensus opinion, and as such, Friendly AI's cloud of
<br>
pan-human characteristics would attempt to capture that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you give me an example of the empirical verification of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ethical/moral system, and then an example of the empirical
</em><br>
refutation of
<br>
<em>&gt; one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  It's nothing fancy.
<br>
<p>First, one has to define the goal.  Here are some examples of goals:
<br>
<p>To get to heaven.
<br>
To be considered a good person by oneself and others.
<br>
To perpetuate the human species.
<br>
To increase the quantity and quality of sentience in this Galaxy.
<br>
To increase in complexity of the universe.
<br>
<p>Second, one has to define the system that is intended to reach (or
<br>
move towards) a goal.  Here are some examples of systems:
<br>
<p>Christianity.
<br>
Humanism.
<br>
Buddhism.
<br>
Complexitism.
<br>
Friendly AI.
<br>
<p>Third, you compare how well actions take within the system move
<br>
toward (or reach) the goal.  If actions within the system do in fact
<br>
achieve the goal, then the system is verified.  Otherwise it is
<br>
refuted.
<br>
<p>This can be summed up with the short phrases like:  Does the system
<br>
achieve its goals?  Does it work?
<br>
<p>------
<br>
<p>I ask myself &quot;what is the most Right goal&quot;? or &quot;what goal encompasses
<br>
all the other Right goals?&quot;.  Then I ask myself &quot;what has the
<br>
universe been doing up to now? (that we know of)&quot;.  And one answer
<br>
appeared to be 'Increasing in complexity'.  This seems to be the
<br>
answer the Universe is giving us when we ask &quot;what are you doing?&quot;.
<br>
This answer correlates well with many of the human moral systems that
<br>
have grown and prospered over the centuries.  Even now we, as humans,
<br>
are attempting to push the complexity of our environment and
<br>
ourselves to ever greater heights.  This seems to be what the
<br>
universe *does*, and as such, I suspect it is the Right thing to do.
<br>
My definition of Rightness makes a first stab at measuring sentient
<br>
actions against-and-within this background of what the universe is
<br>
moving toward.  Although we are the universe measuring itself, and it
<br>
seems circular, it is not.  It is just self-contained.
<br>
<p>Actually, Ben, I have you to thank for some of these ideas.  Please
<br>
pull them apart if you can, because I would love to get it Right ;&gt;
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
