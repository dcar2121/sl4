<p>
Like many folks on these lists, I have little money.  I'd love to be 
<br>
making even $24,000 a year.  Luckily, I'm a student and it's easy for 
<br>
me to live cheaply, but I know out in the real world it costs a little 
<br>
more to survive.  I have recently started giving SIAI quarterly 
<br>
donations of whatever I can.  Last time I held a Guess Eliezer's Age 
<br>
Contest and sent $14.  This may not seem like a lot, and in fact it's 
<br>
not.  But, consider the following:  Eliezer currently lives on an 
<br>
average of $500 a week (that may seem like a lot for weekly expenses, 
<br>
but that's just the average; I'm sure recurring expenses are less than 
<br>
this).  If many of us got together, by send $20 each, we can pay for 
<br>
Eliezer to push forward the Singularity for a week with only 25 people. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One-hundred of us can cover his expenses for a month.  If we were each 
<br>
giving this money quarterly, that's only 300 people who need to send 
<br>
$20.  And, this is only if we were all poor college students:  some 
<br>
people can send more to help out.  Moral of the story, if you like what 
<br>
Eliezer is doing and would like to see him continue to do it, consider 
<br>
sending any loose change that you might have to fund the Research 
<br>
Fellowship.  I can't do it alone, but together we can.
<br>
<p>(If you send money, be sure to note that's it's to pay for the Research 
<br>
Fellowship; if you don't it will go into the SIAI general fund and 
<br>
Eliezer will still have to go find a job).
