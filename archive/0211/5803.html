Michael Roy Ames (re: complexity as a moral goal):
<br>
MRA&gt; Oh, well of course nothing should be *made* the primary goal, I would
<br>
MRA&gt; never think of forcing anyone... but I am attempting to come up with
<br>
MRA&gt; a useful definition, a measure.  It wouldn't have to be the only (or
<br>
MRA&gt; even primary) measure.  The question I am trying to answer is: is it
<br>
MRA&gt; a useful one?  Would it help us understand difficult moral situations
<br>
MRA&gt; with greater ease?
<br>
<p>Samantha Atkins:
<br>
SA&gt; Complexity as such is no meaningful measure of &quot;rightness&quot; at 
<br>
SA&gt; all. It certainly will not help us make moral decisions, 
<br>
SA&gt; difficult or otherwise.
<br>
<p>My sense is that a &quot;higher&quot; ethics or morality does have some relation
<br>
to increasing complexity (or consciousness or intelligence).  On an
<br>
intuitive or perhaps esthetic level I feel this is the &quot;purpose&quot; of
<br>
sentience -- although I wouldn't propose that as an objective,
<br>
measurable reality.
<br>
<p>I can't properly formulate my exact &quot;reasons&quot; for this feeling, as it
<br>
isn't something arrived at through reasoning.  But roughly:
<br>
<p>Say we gave an AI the goal to minimize human suffering and maximize
<br>
human pleasure.  We could well end up with endless pleasure-center
<br>
stimulation or its pharmaceutical or virtual equivalent.  And although
<br>
this would give us pleasure, it's an inward-oriented and stagnant,
<br>
decadent path for sentience to take.
<br>
<p>(Pure pleasure also is less esthetically pleasing.  It's superficial,
<br>
it's not &quot;deeply&quot; satisfying, it doesn't fulfill.)
<br>
<p>In Christian terms it would be a sinful path.  I am not religious nor
<br>
was I raised as such, but in certain ways the statement that the
<br>
above would &quot;go against God's plan&quot; resonates -- perhaps if you
<br>
substitute &quot;Life, the Universe &amp; Everything&quot; for &quot;God&quot;.  To say this
<br>
is, indeed, to anthropomorphize the Universe, to ascribe it goals or
<br>
purpose, for which there is no scientific excuse.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, it feels more Right to me for sentience to be oriented
<br>
towards the complexity found &quot;outside&quot; itself, i.e. to embrace the
<br>
Unknown, rather than to navelgaze.  Facing challenges and hardship,
<br>
assimilating more of the Universe's complexity, seems ethically on a
<br>
higher plane than &quot;just&quot; refraining from hurting other sentients.  (I
<br>
put &quot;outside&quot; in scare quotes because there is much of the Unknown
<br>
inside ourselves as well -- generally the scarier, darker, more
<br>
difficult stuff).  Increasing intelligence.
<br>
<p>To take a different stab at this than ethics, one can judge answers to
<br>
&quot;What is the Meaning of Life?&quot; esthetically.  E.g., &quot;it's all just
<br>
random coincidence&quot; is ugly and nihilistic; &quot;it's so that God could
<br>
judge you and reward/punish you for Eternity&quot; seems trite and
<br>
simplistic; &quot;to become more and more aware of everything around you,
<br>
to get to know things Deeply, until even the most ugly thing to you
<br>
becomes beautiful and the most hated thing loved&quot; seems a step up from
<br>
that.  Although still trite when put in those terms...
<br>
<p>Perhaps all this is just consciousness' self-promoting memetic program
<br>
speaking through me.  As I said, I can't produce any hard arguments
<br>
for these feelings.
<br>
<p>But neither can any morality -- that sentience and its increase is
<br>
Good is either axiomatic or implied in most systems I'm familiar with
<br>
(I read this as the meaning of Thomas 7 in the gnostic gospels).
