</em><br>
<p>My specific interest in game AI is not FPS bots -- that's a solved problem
<br>
so far as I'm concerned. That is indeed a pseudo-commoditized space in human
<br>
simulation; it's basically a packages for navigating 3D space within certain
<br>
parameters. Tightly tied to 3D engines, yes. As soon as you move away from
<br>
run-and-gun behavior, however, you see that there's really nothing out
<br>
there.
<br>
<p>I'm more interested in things that can mimic people, societies and plots in
<br>
MMOGs and CRPGs. Speech, moods, goals, emotions. (So is the US military,
<br>
funnily enough). I think it's fair enough to say that everything except FPS
<br>
bots are pretty much being built from scratch each time. Just look at any
<br>
recent interview with Peter Molyneux -- he's probably doing the best work in
<br>
this sort of societal human simulation thing, but he's nowhere near nor does
<br>
he appear to be headed in the direction of a general engine.
<br>
<p>And yes, you wouldn't be running a general human simulation; the goal is
<br>
really to approach human complexity as the architecture allows. But it seems
<br>
that much of what is needed to perform the MMOG/CRPG type of
<br>
social/plot/goal/mood human simulation can be parallel or have some
<br>
conceptual overlap with early GAI groundwork.
