<p>
Mitch's post (excerpted below), together with his earlier response on this
<br>
topical thread, point to the key reason, IMO, why materialism is essential
<br>
to any realistic worldview. I would put it this way:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No software without hardware.
<br>
<p>I think many people, especially intellectuals, can be seduced by the meme of
<br>
idealism. The idealist (or Platonic) concept that information (or Forms)
<br>
precede material manifestation is very attractive to people whose lives
<br>
revolve around theorizing, computation, and programming. Many philosophers,
<br>
mathematicians and logicians succumb to this point of view (Raymond Smullyan
<br>
and Saul Kripke, for instance). Some physicists do, too (e.g., Frank
<br>
Tipler).
<br>
<p>Life, the universe and everything may be implementable on a variety of
<br>
different material platforms under a range of different physical parameters.
<br>
But they cannot be implemented without SOME material platform. The lowest
<br>
level of implementation of any computational system (Turing-Church
<br>
finite-state machine) must be material. At the bottom of any chain of
<br>
systems emulating other systems is a fundamental physical platform that is
<br>
independent of anything else.
<br>
<p>So, to borrow and modify an old analogy: It's turtles **almost** all the way
<br>
down, but at bottom it's physics.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose fundamental physics turned out to be described by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Game of Life. What would that mean? It would mean that the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was made of two-state entities which are causally coupled to each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other in a certain way. If someone wanted to say that such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe was &quot;made of finite-state machines&quot;, each running the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic state-transition law as their &quot;program&quot; - I would find that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot more reasonable. But the idea that the universe is made of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; software that has no hardware... it's like Pythagoras, &quot;all is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number&quot;. His heart was in the right place, but it would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more accurate to say &quot;All is particle&quot; or &quot;All is field&quot;, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the numbers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; playing a supporting role. I think our contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts to make a fundamental information ontology are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to require a similar compromise with materialism before they get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the ground.
