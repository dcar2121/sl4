<em>&gt;&gt;Michael, as I see it, ethical/moral values cannot be tested

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;They are prescriptive rather than descriptive.

<em>&gt;There are two separate 'questions' here that can become confused if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mixed. Firstly there is question if whether ethical/moral values can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be tested against reality. Secondly there is the question as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether they are prescriptive or descriptive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For the first... I am positing that moral Rightness is an *absolute*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;quality of the universe, therefore if you are correct in saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethical/moral values cannot be tested against reality, then my whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;argument falls. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Testability is a separate issue from moral absoluteness.   On what 
<br>
grounds would you posit that Rightness is a universal absolute?  This is 
<br>
exceedingly arbitrary and inherently unprovable and of questionable meaning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Indeed, if you are correct, then *any* argument that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggests there is absolute right and wrong will fall, and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;morality is arbitrary - merely a random side-effect of human social
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
False dichotomy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suggest that any action taken by a sentience can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;judged against this absolute value, by the sentience itself, viewed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through a window of ver own intelligence and understanding of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation. This implies that a variety of Rightness judgements made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by any given set of independent sentients, starting off with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;differing 'windows', will gradually converge as intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situational-knowledge increase. This 'convergence' is mentioned in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Eliezer's work (peripherally) and I have been uncomfortable with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea. However, if we are to create a self-enhancing machine that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outstrip us in every way, including ethical and moral values, then it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simply due-diligence to attempt to understand in what direction it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will develop *eventually*, and give it a good head-start in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;direction. Thus: Friendly AI. The thing is, Friendly AI has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Right... not just for us, but for whatever we might become in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future as well. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No. It does not require such absolute knowledge any more than we do to 
<br>
make good ethical decisions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It has to be Right, not only for our biosphere, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for any other life we find in the universe also. Its a tall order, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*have* to be Right. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It is inherently impossible by this sort of definition.  It is not at 
<br>
all obvious that a brand-spanking new FAI has to be [R]ight for all 
<br>
sentients for all time.  I will be quite satisfied if it maximizes the 
<br>
local intelligence quotient and insures room for us to survive and grow. 
<br>
&nbsp;That is quite sufficient for now.   This having to be universally Right 
<br>
is simply a formula for paralysis or worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But there is no point shying away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question... that won't help anyone. Sorry for the melodrama... but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sometimes things have to be said - so they are not forgotten.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It is melodramatic and incorrect imho.  There is no need to worry our 
<br>
small little brains about such at this time nor to greatly worry the FAI 
<br>
with it.
