Dear Billy,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Your loose description is a good start... now we just have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to fill in all those pesky definitions for words like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'significant', 'positive/negative' and 'outcomes' ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heavens, no. If you want to approach ethics as an objective,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific problem the last thing you want to do is make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsupported assumptions about anything. [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thus, the wink ;)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You certainly can't justify assuming that your own values are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more correct than anyone else's, or that you have a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grasp of who matters than some other group does - the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that there is disagreement on these points is a sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sighn that you need hard data before you can come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any conclusions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, agreement.  That is why I am currently uncomfortable with the
<br>
idea of encoding an ethical/moral system into software, even if - or
<br>
especially if - it is a sentient piece of software.  When I am
<br>
uncomfortable with something, particularly something as important as
<br>
this, I try to do something about it.  We need 'hard data' on morals.
<br>
FAI currently plans to get it from humans.  This is the only place we
<br>
no of... but that doesn't mean current human morality is the best
<br>
morality.  Could we do better?  Gee, I hope so.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the data has to come first, and it has to be interpreted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independantly of any one person's preconceived notions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the final result 'ought' to be. Otherwise you're just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufacturing excuses for whatever ethical system you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started out with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The data is definitely very, very important.  Also important is how
<br>
that data is compiled, and used.  It would seem an utter waste if the
<br>
data were great, but FAI got stuck with the 'lowest common
<br>
denominator' for everything.  Do we want a FAI to have 'average'
<br>
morals, or the best available?  As soon as you start asking questions
<br>
like this, and really try to figure it out how it would work...
<br>
morality starts to look awfully arbitrary.  And so: here I am, asking
<br>
the question: is there a way to make them less arbitrary?
<br>
