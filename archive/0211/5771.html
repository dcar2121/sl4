<p>Nope, I think you misunderstand here.
<br>
<p>Friendliness is a level up from morals:  meta-morality.  Friendliness 
<br>
is, among other things, a way to find the right morals/ethics, 
<br>
regardless of what they might be.  You could start off by teaching a 
<br>
seed AI Friendliness-content that was very similar to the moral 
<br>
thinking of Eliezer, but if Eliezer is wrong (and it's very likely that 
<br>
he, like all humans, is to some degree wrong, and if he's completely 
<br>
correct it was an accident) it won't matter because the FAI is capable 
<br>
of figuring out how to fix its understanding of morals to be aligned 
<br>
with the morality of the Universe.
<br>
<p>Maybe we've got it all wrong and what we have been calling good is 
<br>
actually bad, like when demons in hell turn the words around and 
<br>
consider bad things good.  It seems doubtful, but it is a possibility, 
<br>
even if small.  If that's the case, an FAI could figure it out.
