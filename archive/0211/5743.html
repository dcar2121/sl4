<em>&gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thinking a little more about our earlier discussion of &quot;Singularity PR&quot;, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came up with the following idea for a website designed to get some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity message across.
</em><br>
<p>Let me begin by saying that I have nothing against creating new
<br>
Singularity-related websites or blogs (I own one myself). However, before a
<br>
serious attempt at implementing such a website is made, perhaps it would be
<br>
wise to identify the real goals that this website might help to achieve.  If
<br>
the goal is to promote Singularity, then, for what purpose? There are two
<br>
possibilities. One, to educate the public about Singularity just because it
<br>
would be better if people knew about it. Two, to educate the public about
<br>
Singularity because that would eventually lead to more funding. I assume the
<br>
real goal is the latter, i.e., to get more funding for AGI/FAI research. If
<br>
that's the case, then the next question is how effective the potential
<br>
Singularity website might be in getting enough funding to continue work on
<br>
AGI/FAI.
<br>
<p>Of course, internet is part of what is known as media, but it's important to
<br>
note that it's very much different than TV, for instance, which is part of
<br>
the media too, in a sense that it requires the audience's active
<br>
participation in the discovery of the message. In other words, the
<br>
difference between internet and TV is that the latter feeds people the
<br>
content while the former requires people to feed themselves that content.
<br>
Actually, internet and TV are two ends of the spectrum indicating how much
<br>
desire and effort an audience member must generate to receive the message.
<br>
This spectrum might look like this: TV &lt; radio &lt; newspapers/magazines/books
<br>
&lt; internet. It is much easier for people to become aware of something when
<br>
it is fed to them through TV screen rather than by means of internet
<br>
communication.
<br>
<p>Singularity is a concept that exists almost exclusively on the internet. If
<br>
one assumes that the target audience for the message is a group of people
<br>
who have never even heard about Singularity before (including media people),
<br>
then how could they be expected to generate desire to learn more about the
<br>
Singularity without any prior knowledge of the concept? Just because a site
<br>
may be on the internet, doesn't mean that people will automatically be
<br>
visiting it. In order to get to the right place on the internet you need a
<br>
desire to go there first, and then to know exactly where you want to go.
<br>
Without those two things already in place, one cannot even begin a search
<br>
for answers which means that before any Singularity website is implemented,
<br>
there must exist ways of generating that desire among the potential audience
<br>
to learn about Singularity. This also means that the internet Singularity PR
<br>
campaign will not be effective until the audience is aware of the concept in
<br>
the first place. Only then, the internet might be helpful in the campaign,
<br>
but only to the extent that it will provide further information about
<br>
Singularity or explain misconceptions about it. There's just so much you
<br>
can do through the internet and a PR campaign is not one of those things.
<br>
(Unless, of course, someone writes &quot;Singularity-virus&quot; whose only purpose
<br>
will be to spam the globe with &quot;legitimate info&quot; on Singularity or AGI/FAI,
<br>
:-). That would make news for sure)
<br>
<p>Obviously, there is no harm in creating as many good Singularity websites as
<br>
possible, but if the audience doesn't even know that the concept exists, let
<br>
alone about the websites devoted to it, all that effort required for their
<br>
implementation will just go to waste. To get the ball rolling, i.e., to
<br>
generate enough awareness among general public (including philanthropists),
<br>
so it is able to sustain and perpetuate itself, it would perhaps be better
<br>
to initiate attempts to contact the media more appropriate for spreading the
<br>
word about
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>Actually, writing a script for a Singularity movie would not be a bad idea,
<br>
after all, if one realizes how much promotion needs to be done to make a
<br>
dent in society's consciousness :). Even then, the problem would be similar
<br>
to the internet one, that is, how to make the right people want to read the
<br>
script in the first place.
<br>
<p>All this will not be needed, though, if AGI/FAI research finds funding
<br>
first.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Comments of any sort are welcome of course (why else would I be posting
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; idea here? ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- Ben G
</em><br>
<p>One final comment, then. We already have two great sites on the internet
<br>
about Singularity, one at KurzweilAI, the other at Singularity Institute.
<br>
The real goal of
<br>
&quot;PR for funding&quot; is to provide the right links to the right people. To make
<br>
them want to go there, and read that stuff in the first place. That would be
<br>
as far as my promotion would go and I would be willing to do it.
