<p>
My probability estimates of various scenarios
<br>
<p>It really is a sad state of affairs that so many human
<br>
beings are so totally blind or apathetic that they're
<br>
doing nothing to help bring about the 'Singularity'. 
<br>
And that the minds of so many are still gripped by
<br>
centuries old dogmas that are opposed to science,
<br>
rationality and progress (for instance fundamentalist
<br>
religion).  What a terrible waste of life!
<br>
<p>Being a visionary is both a blessing and a curse for
<br>
we understand how good the world could be, yet we are
<br>
daily confronted with 'the awful truth' which is the
<br>
present reality.  The terrible frustration and
<br>
alienation that the visionary has to deal with because
<br>
he or she lives in an irrational world is enough to
<br>
drive him or her nearly insane at times :-(   The
<br>
poignant Jack Vance fantasy short story 'Green Magic'
<br>
fully captures the essence of what it means to be a
<br>
visionary.  It's well worth a read.  The story can be
<br>
read on-line at this URL:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/green.htm">http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/green.htm</a>
<br>
<p>That humanity will reach a 'Singularity' at all, or
<br>
that the outcome will be favorable is by no means
<br>
assured.  Whilst Eliezer is having difficulty getting
<br>
grants of a few grand a year, did you know that there
<br>
is an organization called 'The Turning Point Project'
<br>
which has spent millions of dollars on big
<br>
advertisements attacking nanotech, A.I and genetic
<br>
engineering?  Something is wrong with the world :-(
<br>
<p>I'm going to give you my current Bayesian estimates of
<br>
various scenarios:
<br>
<p>Probability that a Singularity will happen:  90%
<br>
<p>If a Singularity doesn't happen, why not?
<br>
<p>Technologically impossible or impractical:            
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5%
<br>
Humanity permanently stifled through techno-phobia
<br>
and/or local disasters:                       10%
<br>
Humanity wiped out through global disaster:           
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85%  
<br>
<p><p>Assuming that a Singularity happens:
<br>
<p>66% confidence interval for date of Singularity:  
<br>
2030-2040
<br>
90% confidence interval for date of Singularity:  
<br>
2020-2050
<br>
<p>Probability of favorable outcome: 90%
<br>
<p>Assuming that the outcome of the Singularity is not
<br>
favorable, why?
<br>
<p>F.A.I cannot help humanity or doesn’t want to:        
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10%
<br>
Unfriendly A.I developed first or F.A.I undergoes
<br>
Failure of Friendliness:         90%
<br>
<p><p>Assuming that the outcome of the Singularity is
<br>
favorable, what happens?
<br>
<p>F.A.I implements 'Sys-Op' over all of human space and
<br>
rapidly offers uplifting to all:         30%
<br>
Multiple F.A.I's integrated with economy help develop
<br>
uplifting technologies gradually:        70%
<br>
<p><p>Which person/organization will get to true A.I first?
<br>
<p>A private person/group or a non-profit institute:  40%
<br>
A major company:                            15%       
<br>
<p>A military R&amp;D group:                              10%
<br>
An academic research project:              30%        
<br>
<p>A public (open source) collaborative effort:        5%
<br>
