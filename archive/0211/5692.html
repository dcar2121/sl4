<em>&gt; A single article has ephemeral impact, which you can either exploit
</em><br>
rapidly
<br>
<em>&gt; or not.  But a systematic PR campaign with successful media effects, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build a whole movement, and get hundreds of millions of dollars moving in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate directions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's human reality, which is what we have to deal with -- for the moment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ;)
</em><br>
<p>My point exactly. A will to attempt a systematic PR campaign is a will to
<br>
acknowledge the reality, and make the best of it. Of course, it would be
<br>
nice if some rich investor just stumbled on SIAI's website, read all the
<br>
articles, and donated 20M for the FAI research, but that's so unlikely to
<br>
happen, it should be considered impossible. This is the kind of mentality
<br>
that expects the audience to do all the work at figuring out what's it all
<br>
about, and assumes that if some idea is right it can always stand on its
<br>
own, no matter how it is presented. Well, the truth is that even brilliant
<br>
ideas, like all ideas, need to be packaged well because otherwise nobody
<br>
will care. It is perhaps easier or more convenient to rely entirely on luck
<br>
and on the strength of the ideas but this usually leads to disappointing
<br>
results. One needs to create his own luck, and a clever PR campaign is just
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>This is not the world where the best ideas or products win automatically.
<br>
The ideas and products with best or heaviest promotion usually do. In fact,
<br>
the success depends on both the idea and the right promotion. Political
<br>
arena and entertainment industry are just few examples of where this is
<br>
true. Sad, but true.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; So, if anyone on this list knows any good PR agents who'd like to
</em><br>
brainstorm
<br>
<em>&gt; on ways to publicize the Singularity, please let me know ;)
</em><br>
<p>I believe I already suggested how one should go about increasing the
<br>
awareness of AGI research or Singularity among potential donors. You locate
<br>
the right media targets (specific magazines, newspapers, radio and TV shows,
<br>
internet sites) and then basically suggest them a story they would be
<br>
interested in. You contact them and say or write something like:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;I have a great suggestion for a story for you about a growing field of
<br>
research that very few people know about, concerned with building
<br>
artificial, self-enhancing, minds that could very soon be smarter than
<br>
humans&quot;.
<br>
<p>Note how short this line is (their time is precious too so you better not
<br>
waste it), then how it refers to AGI &quot;field&quot; and not to the your specific
<br>
research, since it gives your ideas more credibility and that you're not
<br>
alone in your endeavor (as oppose to the some crazy scientist working alone
<br>
in the basement). Note also how it goes right to the point and how that
<br>
point is presented with terms that everybody could understand. But most of
<br>
all note how it is concerned with what you have to offer to the potential
<br>
story writer, not what you want from the writer. It's their job to find a
<br>
good story that people would enjoy reading so assume that it your job to do
<br>
their job. If you make it already attractive-- which is very important or
<br>
even crucial--and easy for them to write it, they will be more willing to
<br>
help you too. Who knows, you could even establish some relationship that
<br>
will result with some more stories in the future.
<br>
<p>And that's the basic approach to the PR campaign, since it applies to all
<br>
media.
<br>
<p>But I would prefer not to use &quot;PR campaign&quot; term since it implies some huge,
<br>
complicated or even expensive task that would necessarily interfere with the
<br>
work on AGI. This is not so scary or time consuming or that it requires
<br>
professional PR agents. In fact this all could be done very cheaply and
<br>
efficiently with minimal effort. The benefits, though, could be enormous.
