<p>Doug,
<br>
<p>Although this question really should be answered by Eliezer, it may be
<br>
interesting for you to hear someone else's point of view.  I will give my
<br>
brief summary of Eliezer's achievements and then make some more general
<br>
comments.
<br>
<p>What I have seen is that Eliezer has done a lot of interesting conceptual
<br>
research into the nature of intelligence, the possible nature of AGI and
<br>
Friendly AGI, and related issues.  This is represented in the documents on
<br>
his website, including CFAI, and &quot;Deliberative General Intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>In my opinion, although Eliezer's style of presentation is less formal than
<br>
is typical in academia, the *content* of his research output over the last
<br>
few years has been superior in quality to that of the vast majority of
<br>
academic theorists.
<br>
<p>If someone wants to fund cognitive-science theory, futurist philosophy and
<br>
theoretical AI, they'd be advancing knowledge more by funding Eliezer than
<br>
by funding nearly any university researcher in these areas.  Furthermore,
<br>
funding a university researcher costs triple funding Eliezer (including
<br>
university overheads).
<br>
<p>Eliezer also designed a programming language called Flare, which is being
<br>
implemented (and which I have mixed feelings about).
<br>
<p>And, as we all know, Eliezer has done a lot to spread the word about the
<br>
Singularity and the importance of AGI and Friendly AGI.
<br>
<p>So, there isn't much doubt in my mind that he has contributed (vastly more
<br>
than) $35K/year worth of intellectual content to society.
<br>
<p>And I am just talking about his publicly released work.  I know he has also
<br>
done some other work on the software design of an AGI system according to
<br>
his Deliberative General Intelligence philosophy, and some coding in the
<br>
area of causal inference, but I haven't seen this work so I can't really
<br>
comment on it in detail.
<br>
<p>Now, all these are reasons why Eliezer &quot;deserves funding.&quot;  I should add
<br>
that I also know a lot of other serious thinkers who deserve funding, and
<br>
who aren't getting it.
<br>
<p>I might, for instance, contend that I myself deserve R&amp;D funding for my own
<br>
work on AGI -- the Novamente project, www.realai.net, which is a serious
<br>
effort to construct an AGI based on the in-development Novamente AI Engine
<br>
software system.  Novamente is currently in a phase of intensive software
<br>
engineering by a small, international team consisting of:
<br>
a) volunteers, and b) individuals being paid to build commercial
<br>
applications based on Novamente.
<br>
<p>For the 2001-2002 academic year, I had a research grant from a wealthy
<br>
individual named Jeffrey Epstein, which paid me a salary to work on
<br>
Novamente AGI.  My grant ended in June 2002 -- and then I was in the same
<br>
situation Eliezer is in now, basically, except that I have a family to
<br>
support whereas he's single.  What I wound up doing is finding a way to pay
<br>
the bills by working on bioinformatics applications of the Novamente
<br>
software.  This is wonderful and exciting -- but the fact is that right now
<br>
there is *no one* being paid to work on Novamente as an AGI system.  We're
<br>
pushing ahead with the project anyway....
<br>
<p>There are many examples besides myself....
<br>
<p>Pei Wang (PhD), creator of the NARS proto-AGI system, is teaching long hours
<br>
at Temple University.  He would be pretty happy to get some research
<br>
funding, I know.
<br>
<p>Jason Hutchens, creator of a chat program that won the Turing-test prize in
<br>
1998 (I think that was the year), and former CTO of the innovative AI
<br>
company a-i.com, has pretty much put his AGI efforts on hold because he
<br>
needs to earn a living and couldn't find funding for his AGI work.
<br>
<p>Hugo de Garis got a professor job at the University of Utah because he
<br>
couldn't get research funding for his work on building specialized
<br>
AGI-oriented computer hardware and teaching it.  His &quot;CAM-Brain  Machine&quot; is
<br>
indefinitely mothballed because of financial issues to do with paying the
<br>
company that built it for him...
<br>
<p>The list goes on and on, really....
<br>
<p>My point is, this kind of work is tough to fund, and there are a LOT of
<br>
folks who have demonstrated records of achievement in AGI and Singularity
<br>
related areas, but can't get funding for their R&amp;D work because it's too far
<br>
out of the academic &amp; industry mainstream.
<br>
<p>Eliezer is very deserving and so are many others.
<br>
<p>We live in a society that is wealthy, but does not value innovative R&amp;D very
<br>
much unless it fits into a culturally acceptable domain.
<br>
