Hi,
<br>
<p>Good news about the Sacramento sanctuary ;)
<br>
<p>If I had an extra room in the house I would've offered it to you....  You're
<br>
always welcome to come stay with us (I'm now living in the DC metro area),
<br>
but we don't have an extra bedroom, and the three kids &amp; three dogs tend to
<br>
cause a lot of commotion.
<br>
<p>About the ideal location for SIAI.  As you note at the end of your message,
<br>
the ideal location depends on the funding situation.  I've often thought
<br>
about similar questions regarding the ideal location for a AGI research
<br>
institute.
<br>
<p>For a research institute with a generous endowment, the ideal location is
<br>
somewhere away from major urban areas, where people can live and work
<br>
comfortably, reasonably inexpensively, and  uninterruptably.   You just
<br>
don't want to go *too* far out in the boondocks or stuff like computer
<br>
supplies become annoying to obtain, and you lose hi-bandwidth internet
<br>
connectivity.
<br>
<p>New Mexico where I was living until recently fit that description pretty
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>Plenty of places in Australia fit the description well too, e.g. Western
<br>
Australia where I lived for a while.  The downside of Oz however is that
<br>
real-time F2F interaction with outside intellectuals &amp; scientists is harder.
<br>
It's a loooong flight back to the Us or Europe for a conference.  So all in
<br>
all I'd vote for non-urban US, probably out West.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, for an organization that needs to fundraise aggressively
<br>
to survive, it's important to be in an area near a good population of
<br>
donors.  Because many donors prefer donating to local organizations.  Near
<br>
Silicon Valley, New York, Boston or DC work for this purpose.  (Or major
<br>
European cities.)
<br>
<p>Yet you don't want to be too close to a big city because then it's so
<br>
expensive for your staff to live... plus a lot of time is wasted in big-city
<br>
commuting chaos.
<br>
<p>So in this scenario, one arrives at the unexciting idea of locating in an
<br>
exurb of a major tech-hub city.
<br>
<p>Sacramento seems to come close to this description, though I think it's a
<br>
bit too urban to be ideal.  There are places within 30 miles of Sacramento
<br>
that would seem to me close to optimal.
<br>

<em>&gt; Subject: Best locations for the Singularity Institute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I recently received an offer of sanctuary (living space) in Sacramento,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CA, starting in February.  If nothing else turns up in the way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fellowship renewal, I'll probably take up that offer, in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conserve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my resources as long as possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, one question that's been on my mind since even before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *ideal* location for the Singularity Institute.  To give you an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how I've been thinking, here's how Sacramento would scope out:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Most major advantage - within a 2-hour drive of Silicon Valley,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including San Jose, San Francisco, and Palo Alto.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Cost of living - 2.3% higher than Atlanta.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Immediate safety, according to a preliminary online check - no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earthquake problems, no recent civil unrest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Long-term safety - not an A-list city for a smuggled nuke or other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapon of mass destruction, but as the capital city of a major state, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the list entirely, either.  Probably better than Atlanta, but nowhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near perfect.  Inside the USA, which is probably not the safest place in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world right now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia, probably the most commonly mentioned candidate, has a low cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of living, is democratic, doesn't seem likely to be targeted by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with weapons of mass destruction, would probably be the nucleus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of revival
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after nuclear war, etc., but their immigration requirements seem very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strict.  It seems like the kind of place the Singularity Institute might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to move to after growing some, if we had sufficient funding, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good place to start.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Undoubtedly the best location in a purely symbolic sense would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Antarctica, but the cost of living would be rather high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
