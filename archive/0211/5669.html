<em>&gt; C'mon, Slawek!!!  Don't be shy ;)   I was specifically trying to solicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-the-wall ideas!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, they will be suggested once there is no funding available at all.
<br>
<p>But let me say this. Although FAI may seem as a strictly technical endeavor,
<br>
not much different than any other private or public project, it is, first
<br>
and foremost, a humanitarian effort trying
<br>
to maximize the chances of a safe Singularity that just happens to be
<br>
implemented by FAI. It's an important distinction because if the approach to
<br>
funding is the same as with any other regular project, then it won't get
<br>
funded at all since it's not a project that is supposed to be &quot;making
<br>
money&quot;. Who can blame potential investors?
<br>
<p>Let's face it, the most probable sources of funding for FAI projects are
<br>
wealthy individuals who would not necessarily have to be familiar with the
<br>
field of AI or FAI, but who would &quot;know enough&quot; about Singularity, its
<br>
consequences, and that it is possible and crucial to implement it in a safe
<br>
way. Some regular people (i.e., not business-oriented types) have enough
<br>
intelligence to understand what's it all about too, and enough money to
<br>
support the FAI research. It's just a question of reaching them. Who cares
<br>
if 1M is
<br>
donated by a Silicon Valley resident or that this million is made up of four
<br>
250K donations made by a wealthy engineer, real estate agent, a celebrity
<br>
and a retired farmer, it's still 1M.
<br>
<p>So the basic idea would be to focus more on the efforts meant to make the
<br>
knowledge more accessible to general public. With some luck, who knows, this
<br>
project may be fully funded by few &quot;wacky&quot; enough people whose background
<br>
may have nothing to do with Computer Science. Unless, there is a person in
<br>
SV who will step in and fund this whole thing, but I guess this would
<br>
require even more luck.
<br>
<p>So how to increase the awareness and make this knowledge more accessible to
<br>
regular people or the &quot;right&quot; people? Well, that's where those off-the-wall
<br>
ideas come in.
<br>
<p>Slawek
