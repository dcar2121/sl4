<em>&gt; judged against this absolute value, by the sentience itself, viewed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through a window of ver own intelligence and understanding of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.
</em><br>
<p>My views on this issue are subtle and, although quite clear in my  mind,
<br>
rather difficult to verbalize.
<br>
<p>I find there are several complementary valid perspectives on ethics/morals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From one such perspective, indeed, ethics/morals cannot be tested and are
</em><br>
&quot;arbitrary.&quot;  Testing can tell you how well a given goal is being
<br>
achieved -- but ethics/morality sets the goal.  And the only way to judge
<br>
how good one goal is versus another, is to create a meta-goal: a goal for
<br>
the process of goal-creation....  But then how does one judge the meta-goal?
<br>
etc. etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From another perspective, though, I don't really think all ethical/moral
</em><br>
systems are equal.  I feel some have more &quot;integrity&quot; than others, in a
<br>
sense I find hard to pin down.  By &quot;integrity&quot; I don't just mean
<br>
self-consistency and self-honesty; but I admit I don't (yet) have a fully
<br>
rigorous characterization of what I do mean.
<br>
<p>Perhaps a superintelligent superwise mind will progress beyond where I have
<br>
on this issue (it would hardly be surprising!!) and form a useful notion of
<br>
the &quot;integrity&quot; (or whatever) of moral/ethical systems (i.e. a useful
<br>
meta-ethic).
<br>
<p>My guess, then, is that this will not take the form of a single criterion of
<br>
Rightness, but rather of a valuation on the space of moral/ethical systems
<br>
that recognizes multiple inconsistent moral/ethical systems as essentially
<br>
equally valuable.
<br>
<p>And, I doubt that the meta-ethic will involve allowing all beings to have
<br>
universes that maximize their own subjective desires at each point in time.
<br>
It's *possible* that it will, but I doubt it.
<br>
<p>But now I've slipped into psychoanalyzing minds that are far far beyond
<br>
me... the confidence level is sinking!!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Of course, some ethical/moral systems could be logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inconsistent -- that is one way of narrowing down the set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of all possible ethical/moral systems ... iff one believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that ethical/moral systems *should* be  logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consistent. Most human ethical/moral systems don't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to me to be very logically consistent...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are correct, then is HIGH TIME that we made a logically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent, and empirically verifiable ethical/moral system. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI isn't it, then I'm betting on the wrong horse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Roy Ames
</em><br>
<p>In my view, Friendly AI isn't really an ethical/moral system.  (Of course,
<br>
Eliezer may disagree!).  In my view, it might rather be thought of as
<br>
<p>-- trying to encourage a certain probability distribution on the space of
<br>
ethical/moral systems.
<br>
<p>-- trying to promote certain ethical/moral principles that do not however,
<br>
in themselves, make a whole &amp; consistent system
<br>
<p>For example, Friendly AI is trying to encourage ethical/moral systems that
<br>
involve significant compassion for all living/sentient organisms, and that
<br>
involve respect for freedom of living/sentient beings.  (It is doing more
<br>
than this also, of course.)  These are principles which some moral/ethical
<br>
systems will agree with more than others.  Friendly AI wants to encourage
<br>
future superintelligent AI's to evolve moral/ethical systems that will agree
<br>
with these principles...
<br>
<p>On a slightly different note, I am still not sure what you mean by
<br>
&quot;empirically verifiable ethical/moral system.&quot;  This almost strikes me as a
<br>
nonsequitur.  Could you give me an example of the empirical verification of
<br>
an ethical/moral system, and then an example of the empirical refutation of
<br>
one?  Perhaps that would help me to better understand what you mean by these
<br>
words...
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Ben
