<p>
Wouldn't it be safer to let a panel of reasonably moral minded folks
<br>
yhammer out a list of some obvious and not so obvious moral decisions
<br>
and let the AI learn based on case based reasoning.  Any decisions made
<br>
off of these examples could therefore be tied back to the set of moral
<br>
tenets it learned from.
<br>
<p>Upon the catching any immoral or questionable ethical decisions made it
<br>
would be possible to enhance the existing moral case set.
<br>
<p>Humans often convince themselves to do questionable moral things by
<br>
rationalizing the action by minimizing the downside and maximizing the
<br>
potential good from the potential upside result.  Knowing how and when
<br>
rationalization is appropriate seems to be the most difficult issue and
<br>
biggest potential 
<br>
cause of trouble.
<br>
<p>The danger in letting the computer learn ethics by itself may cause it
<br>
to at least temporarily favor self-interest over altruistic action.
<br>
<p>Of course this also would let a less ethically minded organization
<br>
create a bot with a questionable moral compass, but that has a potential
<br>
to happen anyway! And at least in a limited sense already being done.
<br>
<p>There are large AI programs now trying to maximize their trading
<br>
strategies in the stock market now to the detriment of the individual
<br>
investor.  They are not as infallable as they might be however due to
<br>
the large role that positive and negative media attention plays in
<br>
determining short term share value, but they are able to react much more
<br>
quickly to economic indicators and technical trend data than their human
<br>
counterparts giving them at least a large theoretical advantage.

</em><br>
<p>Sure....  But I don't know of anything concrete to do right now toward
<br>
the goal of understanding whether or not there's a Universal Moral
<br>
Standard of some kind.  Except for:
<br>
<p>a) meditating on it
<br>
b) trying to build an AI that can make more progress on the issue than
<br>
me...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And as to my belief (or lack of it): I have none.  The definition of 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; scratch it and try again.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think there's a big problem with your working of the definition
<br>
... but I think the concept does strain the bounds of human cognition &amp;
<br>
knowledge...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a way to 'ask the universe the question' like: which of these
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 38 options is the most Right?  Then, wouldn't that be clear up a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of guessing?  (This question is asked only half-rhetorically)
</em><br>
<p>I just asked the universe...
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't understand the answer it gave me ;-)
