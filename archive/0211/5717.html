<em>&gt; I agree, of course.  But to make &quot;news&quot; out of AGI, we need to have some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of dramatic success with our proto-AGI software, and explain it in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear nontechnical way.  the fact that there are some smart people working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on AGI, or working toward the Singularity, is not &quot;news&quot; unless it's spun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; VERY well...
</em><br>
<p>If that's &quot;news&quot;, meaning something similar to what's being reported on CNN
<br>
or MSNBC, then yes, it would need a super spin.
<br>
<p>But coming back to the funding problem, there exists an AGI research which
<br>
would benefit greatly from increased awareness among people who would be
<br>
interested in supporting this research. The problem is that those people
<br>
don't have a clue that this research exists so the question is how to make
<br>
them aware of it. These are some of the ways in which this could be done.
<br>
<p>1) Identify the individuals who would have the means to support your
<br>
project, and contact them personally.
<br>
<p>2) Contact the media and see if they can do story about you or about the
<br>
field. This way you reach much more people mentioned in 1). Those people
<br>
would probably be much more open to your ideas because those ideas would
<br>
have no stigma of being unsolicited attached to them anymore, since those
<br>
potential supporters would be the ones buying the magazines or newspapers
<br>
with the articles, or watching or listening to the interviews.
<br>
<p>Instead of a self-initiated direct contact with potential donors that might
<br>
mess up your chances of getting anything from them in the future, the media
<br>
approach provides an indirect way of reaching much more people, who would
<br>
not have the feeling of being targeted. This
<br>
would provide a pressure-free environment in which they could evaluate the
<br>
possibility of supporting the AGI research.
<br>
<p>3) If getting through to media is the problem, then figure out the way how
<br>
to reach the people in 1) without the media, but make it so that the contact
<br>
is indirect. This is where the strategies become really silly. Make a bunch
<br>
of T-shirts with huge address of your website or an intriguing slogan about
<br>
AGI/Singularity with your website address prominently displayed of course,
<br>
and make your supporters go where people in 1) are, wearing those T-shirt
<br>
obviously (or hats). Or label your car with AGI/Singularity-related messages
<br>
and web address, and drive around Redmond or Manhattan, for example. :)
<br>
<p>But, seriously, I really hope that &quot;Real AI&quot; book does well. It's a real
<br>
opportunity to do some serious promotion of AGI research which I guess would
<br>
be perfect for places like Wired or Tech TV. You would really score big,
<br>
though, if you could get a chance to be interviewed by Tech TV. They've
<br>
already had people like Merkle and Kurzweil (promoting both his last books)
<br>
on, for example, and they always give their guests an easy time there. One
<br>
time, they even mentioned
<br>
extropians in their news. That was a shocker. Plus the exposure is not only
<br>
nationwide, but also international.
<br>
<p>Of course, the real winner would be some working AGI-software. This would
<br>
open up many doors.
