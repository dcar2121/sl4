<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>In spite of your objections, I continue to believe that professional PR
<br>
agents could probably do a lot for the Singularity and AGI.
<br>
<p>Consider, for example, this scenario.
<br>
<p>Suppose a really good professional PR agent gets us to the point where there
<br>
are positive stories in major US newsmagazines, about the Singularity.
<br>
<p>Suppose these stories don't have quite the focus you or I would prefer ...
<br>
but suppose one of them has a sidebar specifically discussing your &amp; my
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>Now, with this kind of publicity, when you or I talk about the Singularity
<br>
to a potential donor, they're very likely to know what we're talking about
<br>
already.  And when we show them the clipping from Newsweek mentioning us,
<br>
they'll take us a lot more seriously....
<br>
<p>I have experienced something like this before (though on a smaller scale).
<br>
In 1998 there were Wall Street Journal and New York Times articles about me
<br>
and my company Webmind inc.  Having my picture in the WSJ really did wonders
<br>
for Webmind Inc.'s fundraising.  Even though the WSJ article was lightweight
<br>
and missed most of the point of what we were doing.
<br>
<p>A single article has ephemeral impact, which you can either exploit rapidly
<br>
or not.  But a systematic PR campaign with successful media effects, can
<br>
build a whole movement, and get hundreds of millions of dollars moving in
<br>
appropriate directions.
<br>
<p>That's human reality, which is what we have to deal with -- for the moment
<br>
;)
<br>
<p>So, if anyone on this list knows any good PR agents who'd like to brainstorm
<br>
on ways to publicize the Singularity, please let me know ;)
<br>
<p>Now I'll respond to some of your particular points.
<br>

<em>&gt; Dumbing down the Singularity for &quot;the masses&quot;... is that really what an

</em><br>
<em>&gt; very effective.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure, Eliezer.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't want to present the world with ONLY a dumbed-down version.
<br>
<p>But perhaps a dumbed-down version could play a valuable role, by bringing a
<br>
lot of people who just aren't ready for full Singularity acceptance, into a
<br>
condition of partial Singularity acceptance.
<br>
<p>It is not nearly so clear to me that an FAI would eschew promulgating
<br>
simplified, more easily acceptable versions of the Singularity.
<br>
<p>If the FAI were vastly superhumanly intelligent, presumably it would be
<br>
better than us at figuring out the likely impact of various PR strategies.
<br>
None of us can effectively second-guess what its choices might be....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have seen newbie Singularitarians try to spin the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity for what they fondly imagine to be the lowest common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denominator, and I have never once seen that trick work.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but I'll repeat that doing PR well is hard.
<br>
<p>Just because a handful of amateurs have failed to effectively create a
<br>
simplified, sellable variant of the Singularity idea, doesn't mean it's
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're saying things that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genuinely believe, somewhere in there will be things that even other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people may find to be worth believing.
</em><br>
<p>Well, there is an art to filtering out the large set of things one genuinely
<br>
believes, and presenting to the world a small subset of them designed for
<br>
maximum effect.
<br>
<p>This is related to the art of PR, though not identical.
<br>
<p>I don't claim to be very advanced in this art myself, but I understand that
<br>
it exists.
<br>
<p>No one is suggesting to lie; the suggestion is to be artfully selective
<br>
about which aspects of the Singularity to emphasize and broadcast widely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're trying to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulative, saying things you think are real clever and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pander to those stupid masses, you will make amateurish manipulative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements that will instantly be filtered out by an audience trained to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resist the highly experienced manipulation of the trained professionals.
</em><br>
<p>My suggestion was not to have amateurs figure out how to do PR for the
<br>
Singularity.
<br>
<p>My suggestion was that it might be interesting to have PR professionals
<br>
think about how to improve the image of the Singularity in general and AGI
<br>
research in particular.
<br>
<p>This may sound like a hokey idea, but the fact is, PR professionals are
<br>
experts in improving the public image of ideas and entities....  They
<br>
understand some aspects of human mass psychology better than the rest of us.
<br>
That's their job.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is the solution to get more practice at manipulating people?  No.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high a competence at manipulation takes too much evil.
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe that good PR agents are intrinsically evil!!
<br>
<p>(And, believe it or not, I've even known a couple non-evil lawyers ;)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those skills could be employed at that level while keeping the essential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message of the Singularity intact.  Remember that we are not here to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves famous.  We are here for the Singularity.  If you make yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; famous and lose the Singularity that is anti-progress.
</em><br>
<p>No one has suggested that fame is the goal.  (Personally, I was interested
<br>
in fame 20 years ago, but I've long since dropped that ambition in favor of
<br>
others.)
<br>
<p>We began by talking about funding for Singularity-oriented research.  It was
<br>
proposed that in order to get more wealthy donors interested in the
<br>
Singularity, it would help a lot if public awareness of the Singularity were
<br>
greater, and public opinion on the Singularity were more positive.  It was
<br>
from this perspective that the possible use of professional PR was raised.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It sure is an inconvenient constraint that theories actually be true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't it?  Science is very useful and it needs more funding.  We need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sell Science.  Well, Science would have so much easier a time competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with astrology if we could just get rid of all that experimental evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and focus on finding theories that are more dramatic and easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandable to the audience.  Let's get rid of that Newtonian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gravitation thing and replace it with angels.  People like angels.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet... it was a popular theory, we got to be really famous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and yet somehow, even though Science has more funding than before, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't really accomplishing as much as it was earlier.
</em><br>
<p>I think the progress of science is actually exponentially accelerating, just
<br>
like the progress of technology.
<br>
<p>Modern science on the whole is working rather well, in spite of the
<br>
bureaucratic inefficiencies of the funding process, and in spite of
<br>
temporary closed-mindedness in variosu particular areas.
<br>
<p>And I repeat: No one was suggesting to lie to anyone.  We were merely
<br>
suggesting to artfully select which aspects of the Singularity to emphasize,
<br>
in order to get a greater number of individuals interested in, and excited
<br>
about, the Singularity.
<br>
<p>This is PR.  I don't claim to be good at it, but I recognize that others are
<br>
good at it; and I see what PR professionals do as valuable and not
<br>
intrinsically evil.
<br>
