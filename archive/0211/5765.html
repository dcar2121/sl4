<p>I think that is mostly an artifact of how humans think about morality. We
<br>
tend to focus on &quot;Fundamental Principles&quot; that are really just heuristics,
<br>
and forget about the goal of the whole enterprise.
<br>
<p>But really, most systems of ethics are attempts to solve a global
<br>
optimization problem that could be loosely described as &quot;for all significant
<br>
entities, maximize the extent to which each entity acheives positive
<br>
outcomes while minimizing negative outcomes&quot;. In practice, human psychology
<br>
and sociology conspire to ensure that the definitions of &quot;significant
<br>
entities&quot;, &quot;positive outcome&quot; and &quot;negative outcome&quot; become political
<br>
footballs, but that isn't a necessary failing. If you get out of the
<br>
business of telling other people what they 'ought' to want, and refrain from
<br>
making initial assumptions about whose opinion matters, you can make the
<br>
problem fairly objective.
<br>
<p>For an entity with perfect knowledge and infinite processing power, in a
<br>
finite deterministic universe, perfect ethics would boil down to a fairly
<br>
well-defined procedure:
<br>
<p>1) Determine every possible set of actions that could be taken between the
<br>
present and the end of the universe. Create a model of the entire universe
<br>
corresponding to each set of actions.
<br>
2) For each of these hypothetical futures, pick out the life history of
<br>
every entity capable of having subjective experiences. Then determine the
<br>
desireability of that hypothetical future by the subjective standards of
<br>
each of these entities.
<br>
3) Pick the hypothetical future with the highest net desireablility, and
<br>
take the actions that lead to it becoming reality.
<br>
<p>Granted, there are some problems with this approach (for example, how do you
<br>
weigh the preferences of goldfish, bald eagles, humans, and transhuman
<br>
entities against each other?), but from this perspective they seem more like
<br>
practical engineering challenges that fundamental imponderables.
<br>
<p>Now, this omniscient super-thinker is obviously impractical, but we can view
<br>
real ethical systems as attempts to approximate its performance in the real
<br>
world. In principle this gives us an objective way to compare competing
<br>
ethical systems: feed them data, apply their recommendations, and see how
<br>
well they work out. In practice it is very hard for humans to do that in
<br>
normal social situations, but that doesn't invalidate the principle. It just
<br>
means that putting ethics on an objective footing would require the
<br>
invention of a new experimental method capable of generating good data
<br>
(perhaps you could experiment on AI-based society models, for example).
