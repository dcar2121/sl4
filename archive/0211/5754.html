<em>&gt;&gt; Hi,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; First time posting here, and I had a question.  Maybe you've already 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discussed it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The question is: what if the Singularity has already happened?  How 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would you tell?  Maybe individual sentient beings are being uplifted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; right now, and wherever you are is as far &quot;up&quot; as you've allowed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yourself to go.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that no Singularity corresponding to either my intuitive or my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical conceptions of morality has altered my existence, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I would not choose to stay the way I am now.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe you haven't opened all of the &quot;existence-altering&quot; doorways.  For 
<br>
example, you could try:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- meditation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- falling in love
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- writing poetry
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- doing drugs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- skydiving
<br>
<p>Basically, anything that produces an experience well outside of what's 
<br>
normal for you-- ideally an intensely emotional one.
<br>
<p>If you keep opening lots and lots of doors, with a strong intent to get 
<br>
to a certain reality, maybe you'll find it.
<br>
<p>(Not that you can't find it by following the path you're on, mind you.  
<br>
But the one you have your heart set on isn't always the most direct 
<br>
route.)
