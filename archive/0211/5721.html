<p>
<em>&gt; But, seriously, I really hope that &quot;Real AI&quot; book does well. It's a real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity to do some serious promotion of AGI research which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be perfect for places like Wired or Tech TV. You would really score big,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, if you could get a chance to be interviewed by Tech TV. They've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already had people like Merkle and Kurzweil (promoting both his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last books)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, for example, and they always give their guests an easy time there. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, they even mentioned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians in their news. That was a shocker. Plus the exposure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationwide, but also international.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the strategy is a bit more indirect than that.
<br>
<p>The &quot;Real AI&quot; book is going to be too academic/technical of a book to be
<br>
promoted widely in this manner.
<br>
<p>However, if it's successful, it will result in AGI research *not* being a
<br>
laughingstock among academic AI people, or at least not being *as much of* a
<br>
laughingstock.  My goal is mainly that AGI be accepted as an eccentric and
<br>
speculative but nonetheless professional and reasonable field of AI
<br>
research.  It is not even at that level of acceptance now.
<br>
<p>If the AGI field can be brought to this (fairly measly) level of
<br>
recognition, then
<br>
<p>a) research grant funding from the NSF, DARPA, etc. will become more
<br>
feasible
<br>
<p>b) when an AGI-related press release is sent to a journalist, and they call
<br>
their &quot;on-call AI expert&quot; for some quick advice, the advice (on average)
<br>
won't be quite so dramatically negative
<br>
<p>This will be a step forward.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, the real winner would be some working AGI-software. This would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open up many doors.
</em><br>
<p>If the Novamente design is right, we will get there in time, even without
<br>
any AGI funding at all.
<br>
<p>The question of funding is merely a question of decreasing the time to
<br>
success by a factor of, say, 2-5.
<br>
<p>Part of the reason I *haven't* been focusing on fundraising for AGI is that
<br>
I've been spending a lot of time on actually getting AGI work done, and
<br>
there are only so many hours in the day....
<br>
<p>Similarly, if Eliezer comes up with a correct design (and I believe there
<br>
are many correct designs), he will probably get there in time even without
<br>
funding, as well.  But the process will be a lot longer and more annoying
<br>
for him...
<br>
<p>One of the wonderful things about AGI research is that a lot of it can be
<br>
done on commodity PC's, unlike nanotech or biotech which tend to require
<br>
very expensive specialized equipment.  It's true that we would progress
<br>
faster if we had a whole bunch of PC's for testing.  But still, it's great
<br>
that we are able to progress at all in the absence of AGI funding -- and we
<br>
are.
