Hmm.  Better check this out with Computability Theory and existence in a 
<br>
finite universe.  Also consider some of the logical conundrums implied 
<br>
by &quot;perfect knowledge&quot;.   There will never be an entity with &quot;perfect 
<br>
knowledge&quot; and &quot;infinite processing power&quot;.  So why base an argument on 
<br>
such even as a useful model.  Models containing logial contradictions 
<br>
are not generally useful except to prove the model is faulty.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) Determine every possible set of actions that could be taken between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present and the end of the universe. Create a model of the entire universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corresponding to each set of actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
And this model is expected to fit in an entity within said universe? 
<br>
&nbsp;Does the modelling itself impinge on the universe?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;2) For each of these hypothetical futures, pick out the life history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;every entity capable of having subjective experiences. Then determine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desireability of that hypothetical future by the subjective standards of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;each of these entities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3) Pick the hypothetical future with the highest net desireablility, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;take the actions that lead to it becoming reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Are we to assume this computation halts at all much less that it halts 
<br>
before the found ideal action is actually no longer relevant?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Granted, there are some problems with this approach (for example, how do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weigh the preferences of goldfish, bald eagles, humans, and transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entities against each other?), but from this perspective they seem more like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practical engineering challenges that fundamental imponderables.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That is a simple problem comparied to the absurdities the model assumes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, this omniscient super-thinker is obviously impractical, but we can view
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It is not &quot;impractical&quot;.  It is logically impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;real ethical systems as attempts to approximate its performance in the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Using an impossible model that cannot perform at all by design?  This is 
<br>
useless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In principle this gives us an objective way to compare competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ethical systems: feed them data, apply their recommendations, and see how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well they work out. In practice it is very hard for humans to do that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;normal social situations, but that doesn't invalidate the principle. It just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;means that putting ethics on an objective footing would require the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invention of a new experimental method capable of generating good data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(perhaps you could experiment on AI-based society models, for example).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
In principle this accomplishes nothing except to construct an impossible 
<br>
and logically inconsistent mindgame. It is a form of Utilitrarianism 
<br>
blown up to super-Universe porportions thus illustrating its absurdity. 
<br>
&nbsp;It obviously begs the question of what is desirable and what is the 
<br>
relationship between subjective appraisal and reality (if any).  In 
<br>
short it begs the question of what constitutes the &quot;good&quot; and 
<br>
substitutes universal subjective hedonism for an answer.
