<p>I often suspect that people look at these questions backwards (though 
<br>
I'm not saying you Samantha). That they struggle with a question like 
<br>
&quot;Should I commit suicide?&quot; as a separate question from &quot;What should I 
<br>
do?&quot; Yet 'commit suicide' is an answer to this initial, fundamental 
<br>
question whereas &quot;Should I commit suicide?&quot; is a question that probably 
<br>
just came up after internally hearing &quot;Awful feeling! Stop the pain! 
<br>
Won't you please stop the pain? I matter!&quot;
<br>
<p>I guess I know what your answer to the question is and you can guess 
<br>
that I don't agree. I felt I should point out that it would be wrong for 
<br>
anyone to struggle with this question by agonizing over whether their 
<br>
&quot;world is hell&quot; or whether they have no hope or how it will affect 
<br>
family and friends, without ever considering whether they are agonizing 
<br>
over totally the wrong things (which I think they probably are).
<br>
<p>(By the way, just in case you were wondering, I do have hope and my 
<br>
world isn't hell..)
