</em><br>
<p>I certainly believe in &quot;sharing ideas that I myself believe&quot; rather than
<br>
lying.
<br>
<p>But I don't believe in &quot;always choosing to share the relevant ideas that I
<br>
most strongly believe&quot; independently of context.
<br>
<p>I believe it's ethically OK to choose which ideas to express, from among the
<br>
MANY ideas one believes, in a context-dependent way.
<br>
<p>According to your eccentric definition of &quot;ethics&quot;, people definitely have
<br>
widely variant ethical codes.  Apparently my ethical code is slightly
<br>
different from yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With respect, Ben, I think I've done a fair amount of Singularity PR over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my lifetime, so I don't think it's fair for you to say that I consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity PR to be unethical.
</em><br>
<p>It's very true, you have done a lot of Singularity PR, and you've been VERY
<br>
EFFECTIVE at spreading the Singularity meme to a certain (important) narrow
<br>
audience.  You deserve many congratulations for this.
<br>
<p>But your methods seem not to be able to spread the word beyond this narrow
<br>
audience.
<br>
<p>So, it's not that you consider Singularity PR in itself unethical; but
<br>
rather, that you consider the methods for Singularity PR that Slawek was
<br>
suggesting unethical.  Sorry I didn't phrase things clearly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're arguing from fully general uncertainty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again; can you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give a specific X in Friendly AI theory that you do not think it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to usefully consider in advance?)
</em><br>
<p>There are many examples.  One example is, the stability of AGI goal-systems
<br>
under self-modification.  To understand this at all in advance of having
<br>
simple self-modifying AGI's to experiment with, one would need a
<br>
tremendously, immeasurably more sophisticated mathematical dynamical systems
<br>
theory than we now possess (or than seems feasible to create in the near
<br>
term).  Yet you seem to be making some very confident assertions in this
<br>
regard in CFAI.
