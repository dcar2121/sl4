</em><br>
<p>I apologize for being an idiot who fails to define his nonstandard terms. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I say &quot;ethics&quot;, I generally refer to globally applied constraints 
<br>
on means, as opposed to &quot;morality&quot;, which is the description of the ends.
<br>
<p>Why be ethical?  Because it is moral to be ethical.  What, then, 
<br>
distinguishes ethics from ordinary morality?  Because ethics are made up 
<br>
of general heuristics applying across a wide range of subgoals, justified 
<br>
as a general heuristic abstractly, placed in a global pool, and then 
<br>
tested locally for applicability.  Thus the moral processing of ethics has 
<br>
a different signature pattern from the moral processing of means-ends 
<br>
analysis, in which you're looking for some set of specific ends that are 
<br>
(as a direct first approximation) predicted to lead to some parent goal. 
<br>
Ethics are useful for taking into account a wide variety of nonlocal 
<br>
properties that may not easily show up when considering &quot;Does A seem 
<br>
likely to lead to B?&quot;.  For example, the probability of A stomping on B's 
<br>
parent goal C, the probability of A having negative side effect E, and so on.
<br>
<p>Specifically, your means-end analysis is saying that &quot;dumbing down the 
<br>
Singularity&quot; is a good way to get to the goal &quot;AGI funding&quot;, and I am 
<br>
attempting to point out all the negative side effects that are the reason 
<br>
for the global ethical constraint &quot;try to share ideas that you yourself 
<br>
believe, rather than trying to manipulate the audience into cognitive 
<br>
states that are useful for your short-term goals&quot;.
<br>
<p>In human terms, the reason that ethics are ethics is because their utility 
<br>
is *not* directly obvious in terms of means-ends analysis, and in fact 
<br>
often directly contradicts means-ends analysis, which, for modified chimps 
<br>
like us, means that some degree of wisdom is needed to stick to your 
<br>
ethics even when it seems inconvenient.  But it does make you more effective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;What makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Singularitarian is the ability to keep your ethical balance when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;entire planet is at risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, there are very difficult ethical decisions to be made here.  I respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you understand the seriousness of the decisions involved, and have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought hard about them; but I don't always agree with your particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think your judgment that doing PR for the Singularity is unethical, is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect judgment.  On the contrary, I think it's unethical NOT to do our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best to do PR for the Singularity -- because doing this PR is the best way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to create the funding that will accelerate the creation of AGI, improving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the odds of a beneficial human-level AGI coming about prior to humanity's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-destruction.
</em><br>
<p>With respect, Ben, I think I've done a fair amount of Singularity PR over 
<br>
my lifetime, so I don't think it's fair for you to say that I consider 
<br>
Singularity PR to be unethical.  What I do think is that Singularity PR is 
<br>
very, very easy to screw up if you begin by compromising those ethical 
<br>
principles that govern PR in general.
<br>
<p>This is why I state that a key quality for Singularitarians is the ability 
<br>
to keep your ethical balance when the entire planet is at stake, rather 
<br>
than abandoning the pool of global ethical heuristics simply because the 
<br>
&quot;ends&quot; in the means-ends analysis got larger than you were used to 
<br>
processing.  Changing the size of the ends doesn't necessarily change the 
<br>
structure of the problem.  You still need the ethics!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I recognize that I don't have a bulletproof demonstration that my ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgment is correct here.  There are many uncertainties involved.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely a judgment call.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Life is uncertain&quot; is a fully general statement, so I am suspicious when 
<br>
it is applied in support of a very specific argument like &quot;Let's 
<br>
compromise the ethical heuristics governing Singularity explanation&quot;. 
<br>
That is, you're selectively applying the fully general statement &quot;Life is 
<br>
uncertain&quot; to arguments you dislike, such as those supporting the ethical 
<br>
heuristics, but not applying that statement to arguments you like, such as 
<br>
your means-ends analysis.  If life is uncertain shouldn't we be more 
<br>
careful about our ethics, rather than less?  Or to be even more specific: 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Life is more uncertain than usual&quot; implies &quot;Where the global ethical 
<br>
pool contradicts means-ends analysis, pay more attention than usual to the 
<br>
global ethical pool.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I'm curious.  What do you propose I should do about the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Novamente *would* destroy the world if it worked, given that you still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;don't understand Friendly AI?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not believe your alleged &quot;fact&quot; is a fact.  So I don't think you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do anything about it.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  Perhaps your audience doesn't believe that your alleged fact, 
<br>
&quot;Novamente would greatly benefit the human race&quot;, is a fact.  Perhaps they 
<br>
don't want you to manipulate them for their own good.
<br>
<p>My ethics are what protect you from my mistakes.  Your ethics are what 
<br>
protect other people from your mistakes.  You don't think you're mistaken? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don't think I'm mistaken about Novamente turning unFriendly 
<br>
either.  Ethics don't switch off when you &quot;don't think you're mistaken&quot;. 
<br>
Ethics don't switch off when the stakes get astronomically high.
<br>
<p>&quot;I do not believe your alleged fact is a fact, therefore I don't think you 
<br>
should do anything about it&quot; is not a moral argument that can be 
<br>
communicated between you and I, because I don't believe that you're 
<br>
correct in saying my alleged fact is not a fact.  The &quot;therefore&quot; fails. 
<br>
On the other hand, I do have a number of ethical principles which govern 
<br>
my actions *even given* that I currently predict Novamente would turn 
<br>
unFriendly, and you can communicate moral arguments to me by appealing to 
<br>
those ethical principles, despite our different views of the local facts. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, you don't need to communicate them to me because I already 
<br>
understand that, e.g., AI projects shouldn't fight, etc., and my mind is 
<br>
sanitized for your protection so that this valuable heuristic doesn't 
<br>
switch off when &quot;the stakes are high&quot; or &quot;I don't think I'm mistaken&quot;, as 
<br>
is the usual emotionally intuitive (i.e., hunter-gatherer 
<br>
genes-benefiting) sequitur.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think *anyone* can understand as much about Friendly AI up-front,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior to having near-human-level AGI's to study, as you think you understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Friendly AI right now.
</em><br>
<p>(Something of a side issue compared to the main thread of the argument, 
<br>
but of course from my perspective you have the causality reversed.  It's 
<br>
not a question of deciding that I understand Friendly AI, but of first 
<br>
deciding that I need to understand X about Friendly AI, followed by 
<br>
expending effort until I understand X, for all X in the current theory of 
<br>
Friendly AI.  You're arguing from fully general uncertainty again; can you 
<br>
give a specific X in Friendly AI theory that you do not think it is 
<br>
possible to usefully consider in advance?)
