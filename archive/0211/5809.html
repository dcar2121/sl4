Ben, the site design (graphics, page layouts) is not moving along as quickly
<br>
as I would like. I have created some sketches of what
<br>
would be a good layout for the pages and have been creating some graphics
<br>
that can be used as themes for the different types of graphs ie cpu
<br>
performance, genome sequencing, etc. Let me know what you think my focus
<br>
should be in creating these graphics. I need more input to be more
<br>
effective.

Subject: Quantitative Singularity data
<br>
<p><p><p>Hi all,
<br>
<p>Aaron McBride, Reason, Richard Kowalski &amp; I have been working a bit on the
<br>
&quot;Singularity popularization&quot; side project that I suggested on this list a
<br>
few weeks ago.  (SingularityPath.org is the tentative name.)
<br>
<p>We're at a stage where it would be nice to have some more quantitative data
<br>
regarding various &quot;Singularity metrics&quot; to play with.
<br>
<p>Right now Aaron is using some data on CPU speed that he dug up, to test his
<br>
dynamic graphing widget and curve-fitting algorithm.
<br>
<p>If anyone has pointers to sources of pertinent quantitative historical data,
<br>
please let me know.
<br>
<p>Also, if anyone else is interested in putting in some volunteer effort on
<br>
the project, please let me know as well!  SingularityPath could use another
<br>
person with Web authoring skills [including forms etc.] and a little spare
<br>
time; and even more so, we could use someone with an interest in gathering &amp;
<br>
curating historical data regarding the Singularity.
<br>
<p>To answer the inevitable comment before it's made: Yes, we're aware that
<br>
people have done this sort of thing before!  I've read the excerpts from
<br>
&quot;The Singularity is Near&quot; on Kurzweil's site, I've seen Kurzweil's lectures,
<br>
I've read &quot;The Spike&quot;, etc. etc.  However, we're going to present the data
<br>
differently than is done on current websites; and I also think it's good to
<br>
have an independent replication of some of the quantitative extrapolations
<br>
Kurzweil has given...
<br>
<p>Thanks
<br>
Ben G
<br>
<p>p.s.  By the way, if any of you should be inclined to mess around with
<br>
fitting hyperexponential curves to data points, we found that a conventional
<br>
unconstrained minimization algorithm worked like crap, whereas a
<br>
floating-point GA with a few acceleration tricks is reasonably rapid &amp;
<br>
effective.
