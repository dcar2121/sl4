Dear SL4,
<br>
<p>I was asked some questions in the SL4 chat room last night, and
<br>
didn't get to answer most.  Here are my answers and commentary that
<br>
may be of interest to you
<br>
<p>-----------
<br>
<p>&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; MRAmes, about your SL4 post: what is the &quot;delta
<br>
function&quot; of a chosen action?
<br>
<p>&lt;MRAmes&gt; Chris: The 'delta function' of a chosen action is a function
<br>
that models the 'delta' or change, in complexity as a result of the
<br>
action.
<br>
<p>-----------
<br>
<p>&lt;Gordon&gt; Rightness is not dependent on your ability to assess
<br>
Rightness what is Right is Right, regardless of your ability to tell
<br>
if it's right or not
<br>
<p>MRA: True.  But how *Right* one can knowably *be* depends on your
<br>
ability to assess Rightness.
<br>
<p>----------
<br>
<p>&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; According to MRAmes, if AaR --&gt; infinite, then
<br>
Rightness will be in the interval [0,1]. Otherwise it will be in
<br>
[a,b] where 0&lt;a&lt;b&lt;1
<br>
<p>MRA: False. The measure 'Rightness' will be in the interval [0,1]
<br>
regardless of ones level of ability to assess Rightness.  But as AaR
<br>
increases ones ability to asses Rightness changes (the window widens)
<br>
and one comes closer to the ideal.
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; I think it would be easier to use a [-1,1] interval;
<br>
negative numbers could be interpreted as &quot;Wrongness&quot; (proportional to
<br>
the damage inflicted to the System)
<br>
<p>MRA: Wrongness is the inverse of Rightness... they are on the same
<br>
continuum.
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>&lt;MichaelA&gt; it's hard to assess what constitutes &quot;damage&quot;
<br>
&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; It's hard to asses what constitutes &quot;good&quot;
<br>
&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; Equally hard, I mean
<br>
&lt;MichaelA&gt; I think it's easier to assess what is &quot;more or less good&quot;
<br>
rather than what is &quot;damage&quot;; &quot;damage&quot; is a more vague term
<br>
&lt;Gordon&gt; damage is something Bad
<br>
&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; Why more vague? Actually, I think it's easier to know
<br>
what's destructive than to know what's creative
<br>
<p>MRA: All actions increase Entropy, or disorder... at least with our
<br>
current understanding of physics ;&gt;  Therefore it is a better analogy
<br>
to define Rightness on a continuum that does not cross zero.  I chose
<br>
a positive continuum to eliminate typing all those minus signs :)
<br>
<p>MRA: It is *opinion* to judge a given action as bad or good, but it
<br>
is *measurable* to judge a given action as a complexity delta.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; [Friendly AI is] Building something that help us
<br>
understand what the heck we're talking about when we say Right and
<br>
Wrong
<br>
<p>MRA: Yes.  This is a big part of what I see as valuable in Friendly
<br>
AI theory.
<br>
<p>--------------
<br>
<p>&lt;Gordon&gt; in my view, accidental processes can be assigned morality
<br>
<p>MRA: Yes, they can be assigned morality, but it is meaningless to do
<br>
so.  Judging how an accidental process *effects* a sentient is
<br>
meaningful, and in that case, it would be on the Bad--Good continuum,
<br>
not the Right--Wrong continuum.
<br>
<p>--------------
<br>
<p>&lt;ChrisRovner&gt; If the process is not carried out by a sentient being,
<br>
then it can't have moral value
<br>
<p>MRA: Correct.
<br>
<p>----------------
<br>
<p>&lt;MichaelA&gt; I think there's a lower bound of nervous system complexity
<br>
needed to approximate morality with any degree of accuracy
<br>
whatsoever, but maybe that's just anthropomorphic on my part
<br>
<p>MRA: As intelligence and situational knowledge approaches zero, the
<br>
'window' of Rightness that a sentient can choose from approaches
<br>
zero.  A mouse, for example, is not very sentient - but there is a
<br>
spark there... it can make decisions.  The Rightness of those
<br>
decisions can be judged based on the mouse's available window.
<br>
<p>-----------
<br>
<p>&lt;Eliezer&gt; higher-Quality premises that result in higher-Quality
<br>
conclusions means that your own perceptions of Quality have perceived
<br>
a step forward
<br>
&lt;Eliezer&gt; heh, Pirsig never took it quite this far, but it's a good
<br>
introduction
<br>
&lt;Eliezer&gt; your perceptions of Quality have perceived *better
<br>
perceptions of Quality*
<br>
<p>MRA: 'Quality' is an interesting idea... I liked it when I originally
<br>
read Pirsig.  But even then, it bothered be that is was so
<br>
subjective.  If we cannot test it against something outside of
<br>
ourself, then its not much use.
<br>
<p>One thing that struck me about FAI, was the way that you suggested it
<br>
be grounded in human decision-making characteristics... and not just
<br>
one human, but the cloud of characteristics that represent many
<br>
different humans.  This hooks Friendliness in something real, it
<br>
makes it into a very defensible morality.  With the definition of
<br>
Rightness, I have tried to describe a way to measure a real situation
<br>
in the universe, and relate that the morality also.  Equating
<br>
Rightness in some way to 'complexity change' removes a lot of baggage
<br>
that comes along with human discussions about morality.  Does it
<br>
throw out the baby with the bath water?  Perhaps not.  The definition
<br>
could be framed in several more-colloquial ways:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'To create is better than to destroy',
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Living things are more valuable than dead things',
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'A human is more precious than an ant',
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Peace is better than war'.
<br>
Perhaps the great majority of moral decisions could be re-assessed in
<br>
the form: &quot;what decision will lead to maximum complexity increase&quot;.
<br>
There may be exceptions to the correspondence - and if there are, I
<br>
would very much like to see an example.
