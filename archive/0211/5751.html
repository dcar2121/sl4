Hi Eliezer,
<br>
<p>Sacramento seems like a good short-term choice; it has attracted many 
<br>
businesses and organisations for reasons similar to those you point out, 
<br>
mostly low costs and proximity to the SF Bay area. I lived in SF for 5 
<br>
years and knew people who commuted between SF/SV and the Sacramento 
<br>
area, so the distances are certainly not bad, although a comfortable, 
<br>
safe, freeway-friendly car is certainly a plus; you'll find a fleet of 
<br>
SUVs and luxury cars making the daily commute.
<br>
<p>Australia would be an excellent long term choice. I've been living in 
<br>
Sydney for almost thee years and find the communications, Internet 
<br>
connectivity and access to commodity technology terrific. Costs are 
<br>
likely to remain low with respect to the US as the Australian economy is 
<br>
valued largely on its agriculture and mineral industries, even though in 
<br>
reality it's shifting heavily toward service, IT and biomedical. The 
<br>
US/AU free trade agreement is likely to have the largest near-term 
<br>
impact on the cost of living, but honestly it could go either way 
<br>
depending on what trade imbalances and industry shake-ups are seen.
<br>
<p>The recent bombing in Bali and Al Quaeda threats specific to Australia 
<br>
however probably mean Australian cities aren't the safest places in the 
<br>
world with respect to terrorism. I'd suggest a location away from urban 
<br>
centers; rural NSW or VIC would be a good choice as you can still have a 
<br>
location within a few hours of Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra, with easy 
<br>
access to daily non-stop flights from SYD/MEL to SFO/LAX.
<br>
<p>Natural disasters are fairly easy to avoid. Many places in QLD and NT 
<br>
have tropical climates and suffer typhoons. Earthquakes are rare, but I 
<br>
would suggest an earthquake-safe structure in any case. This year has 
<br>
seen terrible drought, and other years might see worse. With this and 
<br>
the California 'energy crisis' in mind, I'd suggest a location where 
<br>
self-sufficiency is possible; Australian architecture and technology are 
<br>
geared heavily toward making this possible (environment friendly designs 
<br>
and building materials, passive cooling, solar hot water, solar 
<br>
electricity, rainwater collection, etc. are all the norm in the 
<br>
cutting-edge of the building industry).
