<em>&gt; However, one question that's been on my mind since even before then is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *ideal* location for the Singularity Institute.  To give you an example of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how I've been thinking, here's how Sacramento would scope out:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Most major advantage - within a 2-hour drive of Silicon Valley, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including San Jose, San Francisco, and Palo Alto.
</em><br>
<p><p>Assuming no traffic.  Double that during peak times, maybe 3-hours
<br>
off-peak during the week.  Sacramento is also 2-hours (in reality this
<br>
time) from the Tahoe/Reno area, which has a large population of
<br>
interesting and wealthy Silicon Valley expats.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Cost of living - 2.3% higher than Atlanta.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yep.  Pretty average compared to the national average, but vastly
<br>
cheaper than the Bay Area metro.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 3)  Immediate safety, according to a preliminary online check - no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earthquake problems, no recent civil unrest.
</em><br>
<p><p>Other than the crime problems associated with those types of
<br>
communities, the biggest problem you might have is flooding.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Long-term safety - not an A-list city for a smuggled nuke or other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapon of mass destruction, but as the capital city of a major state, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the list entirely, either.  Probably better than Atlanta, but nowhere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near perfect.  Inside the USA, which is probably not the safest place in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world right now.
</em><br>
<p><p>Of course, Sacramento is directly in the shadow of secondary effects
<br>
from WMD, and which is also where the major feeder Interstates from the
<br>
A-list targets go, but your point is still valid.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
I pretty much despise Sacramento (at least if I had to live there), but
<br>
it will probably work relatively well for your purposes.  Meanwhile, I'm
<br>
trying to get OUT of the Bay Area, for a good number of the reasons you
<br>
mentioned...
