<p>Yes, that's a great idea, but......
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The goal of the site I propose is simple: I want to get media type people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in the Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>But, as I pointed out earlier, this is not possible if the target audience
<br>
(including media people) has never heard the word &quot;Singularity&quot; before. In
<br>
order for the website to work, there needs to be a way of making  people
<br>
aware that the website or the concept exists, and, more importantly, a way
<br>
of making it desirable for the audience to seek the information. Those two
<br>
things are necessarily required before the audience may even entertain the
<br>
idea of visiting the website. The desire to learn about Singularity will not
<br>
appear out of nothing. We need to tell the people that the message exists
<br>
before they can start searching for it, and unlike with TV, internet
<br>
involves putting effort into the search which can't materialize by itself
<br>
without the public's already existing desire or will to find the answers.
<br>
It's a &quot;chicken-egg&quot; thing, except we have the ability to jumpstart this
<br>
process, not the public.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Why get media type people interested in the Singularity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because, for one thing, I suspect that will attract some good PR people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do PR for the Singularity for the benefit of their own careers, without us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having to pay them for it...
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the key word is &quot;attract&quot; here. The website is a finished product, and
<br>
the ultimate success is when a person actually visits the site which might
<br>
be analogous to &quot;buying&quot; the product in store. Of course, it is later up to
<br>
the consumer to decide whether he/she likes the product, but as everybody
<br>
knows, nobody will buy the product, unless he/she knows that the product
<br>
exists and he/she wants to buy it. That's why advertising industry exists.
<br>
In this case, one needs to figure out what the equivalent of a commercial
<br>
for Singularity or a Singularity website (which is the end product) might
<br>
be. A Matrix-type movie, but focused on Singularity, and without the usual
<br>
SF nonsense, would be perfect for this.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; About Internet versus print media and TV, there are many cases in recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of something springing from the Net into traditional media.
</em><br>
<p>Consider the amount of TV-inspired content that finds its way on the
<br>
internet, for example, and how much internet-exclusive content makes it to
<br>
the other media. Internet's impact on the collective conscience of society
<br>
is almost nonexistent.
<br>
<p>In light of all this, I think I'm going to work on my movie script :).
