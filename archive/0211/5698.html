<em> &gt; Okay, I see now what you were trying to say here. Unfortunately, it

</em><br>
<em> &gt; which was to make the FAI research famous in order to get funding, not

<p>You're placing too much trust in your moral intuitions.  Generally, if a 
<br>
moral compromise instinctively seems like a good idea, it's because in the 
<br>
ancestral environment that moral compromise would have promoted your 
<br>
*personal* reproductive fitness.  It is not a coincidence that the moral 
<br>
compromises that seemed to Stalin to promise the greatest good for the 
<br>
greatest number ended up with Stalin as tribal chief and all of the 
<br>
supposed beneficiaries miserable.  I don't mean to imply that this 
<br>
evolutionary motivation is explicitly represented in cognition either 
<br>
consciously or subconsciously; explictly thinking &quot;I am riding this issue 
<br>
for the sake of personal fame&quot; would tend to interfere with riding the 
<br>
issue for the sake of personal fame.
<br>
<p>It seems to your moral intuitions like compromising the message at the 
<br>
heart of the Singularity seems like a good idea, something that would work 
<br>
to promote the Singularity, and certainly not anything that you are doing 
<br>
for the sake of personal fame.  Why does it seem like a good idea?  Is it 
<br>
an empirical generalization from the history of postagricultural 
<br>
societies?  Are you modeling the detailed effect of your moral compromise 
<br>
on millions of interacting people in order to predict the outcome of a 
<br>
complex social and memetic system?  Of course not.  It seems like a good 
<br>
idea because fifty thousand years ago, people who thought it was a good 
<br>
idea tended to end up as tribal chiefs.  In the domain of politics, a 
<br>
means to an end intuitively seems like a good idea to the extent that 
<br>
carrying out that means would have served the purposes of your genes in a 
<br>
hunter-gatherer tribe, not to the extent the means would achieve its 
<br>
supposed end in our far more complex culture.
<br>
<p>It *is* a famous empirical generalization from the history of 
<br>
postagricultural societies that people who start out by making moral 
<br>
compromises in the service of their ideals usually end up not 
<br>
accomplishing anything toward those ideals, although their adaptations may 
<br>
(or may not) operate in accordance with ancestral function to place them 
<br>
in positions of personal benefit.
