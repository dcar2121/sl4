The term 'prescriptive ethics' &amp; 'descriptive ethics' have the following
<br>
generally accepted meanings:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.optimal.org/peter/prescriptive_ethics.htm">http://www.optimal.org/peter/prescriptive_ethics.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Prescriptive - a set of principles that will help you a achieve a given
<br>
purpose (please God, maximize happiness, etc.) - ie. what you *should* do to
<br>
achieve some specified meta-ethical goal (whatever this might be).
<br>
<p>Descriptive -  describing what people 'actually' do (sociology). Recently
<br>
this has often become intertwined with evolutionary psychology in trying to
<br>
explain this behavior
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.optimal.org/peter/ethics_skeptic.htm">http://www.optimal.org/peter/ethics_skeptic.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p>As far as the ultimate goal of any moral/ ethical system is concerned (ie.
<br>
the meta-ethics), I don't believe that any absolute standard can apply, but
<br>
that we can *inductively* come to the conclusion (with all the limitations
<br>
of deduction) that human flourishing is a reasonable goal to pick. Obviously
<br>
this statement is controversial for many people.
<br>
<p>What I *do* believe can be shown is that once a meta-ethical goal has been
<br>
picked, one can go about 'scientifically' (ie. rationally) determining the
<br>
principles and character traits that will generally foster achievement of
<br>
this goal. I have written fairly extensively about achieving human
<br>
flourishing - what I call 'Optimal Living'

<br>
<p>There are two separate 'questions' here that can become confused if
<br>
mixed. Firstly there is question if whether ethical/moral values can
<br>
be tested against reality. Secondly there is the question as to
<br>
whether they are prescriptive or descriptive.
<br>
<p>For the first... I am positing that moral Rightness is an *absolute*
<br>
quality of the universe, therefore if you are correct in saying that
<br>
ethical/moral values cannot be tested against reality, then my whole
<br>
argument falls. Indeed, if you are correct, then *any* argument that
<br>
suggests there is absolute right and wrong will fall, and all
<br>
morality is arbitrary - merely a random side-effect of human social
<br>
consciousness. I suggest that any action taken by a sentience can be
<br>
judged against this absolute value.....
<br>
<p>For the second... moral values can be both prescriptive (thou shalt
<br>
not murder) and descriptive (murder hurts the community). ....
