<p>Who says there is no hardware?  The universe we know could 
<br>
easily be a simulation/VR in a very advanced hardware system 
<br>
outside (obviously) the program/simulation that we are 
<br>
semi-autonomous agents within.  Perhaps you are getting hung up 
<br>
I think on the use of &quot;universe&quot; in its two primary meanings as 
<br>
either &quot;all that is&quot; or &quot;this bubble of more or less contiguous 
<br>
space-time we inhabit&quot;.  We cannot meaningfully say that the 
<br>
latter is the former except as a bald assertion.
