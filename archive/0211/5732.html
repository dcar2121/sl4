</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Should I commit suicide?&quot; as a separate question from &quot;What should I

</em><br>

</em><br>

<em>&gt;&gt; the pain! Won't you please stop the pain? I matter!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I guess I know what your answer to the question is and you can guess 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em> &gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So it was rather obvious that &quot;Should I commit suicide&quot; is not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.   However,  I don't begrudge any sentient the right to wrestle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with their pain and options and decide so basic a question for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.  I would not presume to answer it for others.
</em><br>
<p>Samantha, saying that people have the *right* to make the choice is one 
<br>
thing.  It is another thing entirely to say that they must make it without 
<br>
help and alone.  The concept of &quot;Oops, I'm asking the wrong question&quot; is 
<br>
universal, and I see no reason why Edwin Evans should not ask whether 
<br>
potential suicides are asking the wrong question, either objectively or 
<br>
under their own standards, depending on whether it's an objective 
<br>
question.  The reason that you yourself gave is not one that seems like it 
<br>
would be unique to Samantha Atkins alone out of all the world.  Why 
<br>
wouldn't someone else pondering the question be interested?
