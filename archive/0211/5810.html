Dear Billy,
<br>
<p>You wrote:
<br>

combination of
<br>

</em><br>
a
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  What you have described: facts about existing human ethics,
<br>
ways of judging ethical dilemmas, defined measures (and their
<br>
limitations) and how to use those measures - is part of Friendliness
<br>
content.  We can start creating and organizing this sort of content
<br>
immediately, because it is not contingent upon the detailed design of
<br>
FAI.  Once a Seed AI is up and running, and is in the learning phase,
<br>
this content can be introduced/taught/shown to the program in easily
<br>
digestible lessons.  I believe that a lot of groundwork can be laid
<br>
in preparing this content, and that such content will be useful for
<br>
*any* AI project that wishes to contain and manipulate ethical/moral
<br>
data.  Such content will obviously be just heuristics, 'rules of
<br>
thumb', and will be merely a starting point from which a sentience
<br>
can learn through experience of simulated moral dilemmas, and
<br>
interaction with other moral sentients.
<br>
<p>Creating the FAI content is going to be interesting and important,
<br>
and can proceed independently of the programming of the Seed AI.  I
<br>
imagine it to be like putting together the schooling curriculum for a
<br>
child, a child who will probably absorb and integrate the information
<br>
very quickly.  The simulations and tests presented to a Seed AI will
<br>
be as important (if not more so) than the initial content, as *that*
<br>
is when the Seed AI will relate the new information to all the other
<br>
knowledge it has.  The lessons will have to be graded (just like for
<br>
human children) starting with very simplistic material, probably
<br>
tailored to a 'toy-simulation' or 'microdomain', and gradually
<br>
becoming more sophisticated as the Seed AI grows in intelligence.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure if SL4 is the place to discuss the Seed AI's curriculum
<br>
(Eliezer?) but I have lots of ideas about it (I'm sure many
<br>
subscribers here do as well).  I'll save them for another time.
<br>
<p>Michael Roy Ames
