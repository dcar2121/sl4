</em><br>
<em>&gt; well worth helping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just to be clear, this should not affect SIAI's plans, or the donations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has accumulated (and continues to accumulate) in its main fund. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only effect will be that Eliezer's research fellowship is now going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to find alternate means of funding. Assuming that funding can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found then things will continue as before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer will follow up with more information about his own situation.
</em><br>
<p>First, let me reassure everyone that I am not in immediate jeopardy.  I do 
<br>
have some savings stored up, and one of our previous major donors has made 
<br>
a stopgap contribution to provide another four months (starting in the 
<br>
month of November) of the Fellowship.
<br>
<p>However, I do need to find another source of support for the Research 
<br>
Fellowship, soon.  The previous Fellowship was $24,000/year, but the 
<br>
Atkins also donated rent-free living space on property they owned.  My 
<br>
guess is that $32,000/year is probably a more realistic estimate of what 
<br>
would be needed to maintain parity, although $24,000/year would certainly 
<br>
be a lot better than nothing.  (It would be enough to survive on, but 
<br>
going to conferences and so on would probably be ruled out.)
<br>
<p>In the event that I cannot find any source of funding, I will burn savings 
<br>
to continue working on the Singularity full-time until my savings reach a 
<br>
danger point.  If by that time no new support has been found, I will 
<br>
attempt to find a job that leaves me enough mental energy to continue to 
<br>
accomplish at least some work on the Singularity.  I would consider this 
<br>
scenario a failure.  There's a difference between knowing you have to try, 
<br>
and expecting to succeed.  The work that needs doing cannot realistically 
<br>
be done on a part-time basis.
<br>
<p>As there is now a specific subproject that needs immediate funding, there 
<br>
is a better chance than previously of receiving funding from foundations. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the vast majority of big private foundations: (a) have areas of 
<br>
interest that are too tightly bounded to allow for maverick, 
<br>
category-defying, ultraleveraged projects like the Singularity Institute; 
<br>
(b) have funding cycles with very long periodicity, meaning that no 
<br>
additional funding would come in for many months; (c) are run by 
<br>
committees whose members are afraid of looking foolish to each other.  If 
<br>
any of you have suggestions for private foundations that are *good* 
<br>
prospects - not &quot;Gee, it sure would be nice if the Ford Foundation stepped 
<br>
in, wouldn't it?&quot;, but foundations whose grant criteria you have examined 
<br>
and whose mission actually seems unusually appropriate to the Singularity 
<br>
Institute - please let me know.  An example of what I would consider a 
<br>
&quot;good prospect&quot; is the Ashoka Foundation.  (With respect to Ashoka, please 
<br>
do not helpfully mess up my chances by flooding them with nominations. 
<br>
I've already asked someone to consider nominating me if he feels I fit 
<br>
Ashoka's criteria.)
<br>
<p>If you know somewhere I can find lists of comparatively small private 
<br>
foundations and donor-advised funds - i.e., the sort of grantmakers that 
<br>
are often controlled by one or two founders who can make fast personal 
<br>
decisions without answering to others for their actions - please let me 
<br>
know.  A small, fast, flexible foundation seems like the best bet.
<br>
<p>Most likely of all is funding from individuals.  If you know of an 
<br>
individual whom you think might be (a) reachable and (b) interested in 
<br>
funding the Research Fellowship - again avoiding suggestions such as &quot;It 
<br>
sure would be nice if Bill Gates stepped in, huh?&quot; - then please let me 
<br>
know, or (if you are a friend or associate) contact this person on your 
<br>
own initiative.
<br>
<p>Please note that, as I am both a Research Fellow and a Director of the 
<br>
Singularity Institute, only donations specifically released by the donor 
<br>
to the Fellowship fund can be used for that purpose.  This is not a legal 
<br>
requirement, but it is the voluntary, self-imposed policy of the 
<br>
Singularity Institute.  If you wish a contribution to be used for the 
<br>
Research Fellowship, please say so.
<br>
<p>If you are reading this and you have the resources to support the Research 
<br>
Fellowship, in whole or in part, on a once-off or continuing basis, please 
<br>
consider offering your support.  The work of the Singularity Institute is 
<br>
not finished, nor is the work of the Research Fellowship.  Even for those 
<br>
attainable first steps which have already seen substantial progress as the 
<br>
result of the Research Fellowship - such as building a Singularity 
<br>
movement, and developing as much specific Friendly AI theory as possible 
<br>
in advance - a great deal more work yet remains.  Please consider the 
<br>
matter of the Singularity Institute, and humanity's continuing 
<br>
acceleration toward the Singularity, and the question of Friendly AI, and 
<br>
decide whether you would like to see further progress made.  If you have 
<br>
the ability to help, then please help.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
Eliezer.
