<p>Well, Eliezer and I have argued extensively about such issues before and
<br>
have never really seen eye-to-eye on them.  So it's not surprising if you
<br>
and I also disagree ;)
<br>
<p>It may be that my view of these things is sufficiently different that I
<br>
shouldn't use the term &quot;Friendly AI&quot; and should use a different term.
<br>
<p>What I'm really after is a superhumanly intelligent AI that
<br>
<p>a) values humans &amp; sentient life generally
<br>
b) is highly aware of ethical issues and their difficulty and importance
<br>
<p>I.e., an &quot;Ethically Aware, Human-Friendly AI.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am not at all sure there's such a thing as &quot;the morality of the universe.&quot;
<br>
<p>However, I believe the notion of an &quot;Ethically Aware, Human-Friendly AI&quot; is
<br>
meaningful and worthwhile whether or not a &quot;universal morality&quot; exists.
<br>
<p>When you say &quot;Maybe ... what we have been calling good is actually bad&quot;, I
<br>
am tempted to interpret your statement as &quot;Maybe our specific ethical codes
<br>
of behavior are actually inconsistent with our abstract ethical goals.&quot;  Of
<br>
course this kind of inconsistency is possible even with the best of
<br>
intentions, because predicting the long-term outcome of a certain type of
<br>
behavior can be a difficult problem.
<br>
<p>But I think you mean the statement a different way -- you, like Michael Roy
<br>
Ames, seem to believe that there is some True and Universal Moral Standard,
<br>
which an FAI will find....
<br>
<p>Well, maybe it will.  I'm not confident either way....
<br>
<p>But I am confident that if such a thing does exist and is found by a
<br>
superhumanly intelligent AI, it will transcend in many ways our human
<br>
concepts of &quot;morals&quot; and &quot;ethics&quot; -- both fulfilling and disappointing the
<br>
ideas and feelings elicited in our human  minds by the phrase &quot;Universal
<br>
Morality&quot; ...
<br>
<p>My work toward an Ethically Aware, Human-Friendly, superhumanly intelligent
<br>
AI is independent of the outcome of philosophical debates about the
<br>
existence or otherwise of universal morality.
