<p>
Eliezer,
<br>
<p>I don't see doing well-thought-out PR campaign in favor of the Singularity
<br>
as necessarily being a moral compromise.
<br>
<p>Some PR campaigns *are* immoral; others, in my view, are not.
<br>
<p>What moral principle do you think that a well-thought-out PR campaign
<br>
violates?
<br>
<p>Think about it this way.  Imagine you have 10 seconds to convince entity Y
<br>
of conclusion X.  But to tell Y even a reasonable fraction of what you know
<br>
about X, will take 60 seconds.  So you have to be selective.  There is one
<br>
10-second statement about X (call it X1) that you think really captures
<br>
what's most central and important about X; but there is another 10-second
<br>
statement about X (call it X2) that you think will be more convincing to Y
<br>
(ie more likely to convince Y of X).
<br>
<p>What is the most rational way to spend your 10 seconds?  Telling Y X1, or
<br>
telling Y X2?
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this is the situation one is in, when trying to get complex
<br>
ideas across to the mass of humanity, at this stage.
<br>
<p>Is it immoral to tell Y X2 rather than X1, in order to convince them?
<br>
<p>The moral dilemma, for me, comes up when there's another statement X3, which
<br>
you know to be FALSE, but which you calculate has an even higher chance than
<br>
X2 of convincing Y of X.  In this case, you have the well-known moral
<br>
dilemma of whether to like to Y for its own good.  But in the X1 vs. X2
<br>
choice, I see no moral dilemma.  [Though I do see a source of frustration,
<br>
because as a truth-seeking individual one would always *rather* say X1 than
<br>
X2...]
<br>

<em>&gt;  &gt; Okay, I see now what you were trying to say here. Unfortunately, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; looks like you completely missed the point of the whole discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; which was to make the FAI research famous in order to get funding, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; making you famous. Getting personal fame for the right reasons would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; not be that easy either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're placing too much trust in your moral intuitions.  Generally, if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral compromise instinctively seems like a good idea, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestral environment that moral compromise would have promoted your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *personal* reproductive fitness.  It is not a coincidence that the moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromises that seemed to Stalin to promise the greatest good for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest number ended up with Stalin as tribal chief and all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed beneficiaries miserable.  I don't mean to imply that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary motivation is explicitly represented in cognition either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciously or subconsciously; explictly thinking &quot;I am riding this issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the sake of personal fame&quot; would tend to interfere with riding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue for the sake of personal fame.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to your moral intuitions like compromising the message at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart of the Singularity seems like a good idea, something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to promote the Singularity, and certainly not anything that you are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the sake of personal fame.  Why does it seem like a good idea?  Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an empirical generalization from the history of postagricultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies?  Are you modeling the detailed effect of your moral compromise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on millions of interacting people in order to predict the outcome of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex social and memetic system?  Of course not.  It seems like a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea because fifty thousand years ago, people who thought it was a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea tended to end up as tribal chiefs.  In the domain of politics, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means to an end intuitively seems like a good idea to the extent that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carrying out that means would have served the purposes of your genes in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunter-gatherer tribe, not to the extent the means would achieve its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed end in our far more complex culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It *is* a famous empirical generalization from the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postagricultural societies that people who start out by making moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromises in the service of their ideals usually end up not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishing anything toward those ideals, although their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptations may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or may not) operate in accordance with ancestral function to place them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in positions of personal benefit.
