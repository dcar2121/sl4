<em>&gt; I'd also ask you to consider narrowing your focus from the extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general issue of &quot;the stability of self-modifying goal systems&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements of the order found in CFAI, such as &quot;A goal system with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external reference semantics and probabilistic supergoals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exhibits certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors that are morally relevant to Friendly AI and necessary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI construction, and is therefore a superior design choice by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison with more commonly proposed goal system structures under which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoals are treated as correct by definition.&quot;  Why do you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, e.g., this specific question cannot be considered in advance?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; Eliezer S. Yudkowsky
</em><br>
<p>Although I've spent much of my life creating heuristic conceptual arguments
<br>
about topics of interest, the three forms of knowledge I trust most are:
<br>
<p>-- mathematical
<br>
-- empirical
<br>
-- experiential [when referring to subjective domains]
<br>
<p>I'm afraid that your interesting conjectures about goal systems and Friendly
<br>
AI are not currently demonstrable via any of these three forms of knowledge.
<br>
<p>Friendly AI is not something we can know much about experientially, being
<br>
humans.
<br>
<p>It's not something we can know too much about empirically until we have some
<br>
AGI's to experiment with.
<br>
<p>That leaves mathematics.  One could formalize the notion of &quot;A goal system
<br>
with external reference semantics and probabilistic supergoals&quot;
<br>
mathematically, and try to prove your conjectures about AGI's with this sort
<br>
of goal system.  I think there are many ways to perform the formalization,
<br>
using current mathematical concepts.  But, I don't think current math is
<br>
anywhere near up to constructing the actual proof (or disproof) of the
<br>
formalized correlates of your conjectures.
<br>
<p>So, yeah, we can consider questions like &quot;stability of certain types of AGI
<br>
goal systems&quot; in advance.  But barring a tremendous math breakthrough, all
<br>
we can hope to find, in advance, are moderately convincing, suggestive,
<br>
heuristic arguments.  These arguments may be valuable for directing
<br>
research, of course -- I would never claim they were worthless!
<br>
<p>My own arguments as to why Novamente will work as an AGI are also in the
<br>
category of &quot;moderately convincing, suggestive, heuristic arguments&quot; at this
<br>
stage.  But we're working hard to turn them into empirical demonstrations ;)
<br>
<p>One characteristic of &quot;moderately convincing, suggestive, heuristic
<br>
arguments&quot; is that intelligent, informed, fair-minded people can rationally
<br>
disagree on their validity....
