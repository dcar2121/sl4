<em>&gt; &gt; Could you give me an example of the empirical verification of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an ethical/moral system, and then an example of the empirical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refutation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure.  It's nothing fancy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, one has to define the goal.  Here are some examples of goals:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To get to heaven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be considered a good person by oneself and others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To perpetuate the human species.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To increase the quantity and quality of sentience in this Galaxy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To increase in complexity of the universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, one has to define the system that is intended to reach (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move towards) a goal.  Here are some examples of systems:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humanism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Complexitism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third, you compare how well actions take within the system move
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward (or reach) the goal.  If actions within the system do in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve the goal, then the system is verified.  Otherwise it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This can be summed up with the short phrases like:  Does the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve its goals?  Does it work?
</em><br>
<p>This much is straightforward.  Because the goal is given, and one is then
<br>
asking how well the goal is achieved by a given system.
<br>
<p>The difficulty comes in comparing various goals against one another.  I.e.,
<br>
the hard part is choosing a goal!
<br>
<p>For example is
<br>
<p>A = &quot;increase the quantity and quality of sentience in this Galaxy.&quot;
<br>
<p>a better goal than
<br>
<p>B = &quot;increase in complexity of the universe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or, is
<br>
<p>.5 * A + .5*B
<br>
<p>better than
<br>
<p>.3 * A + .7 * B
<br>
<p>??
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I ask myself &quot;what is the most Right goal&quot;? or &quot;what goal encompasses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the other Right goals?&quot;.  Then I ask myself &quot;what has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe been doing up to now? (that we know of)&quot;.  And one answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeared to be 'Increasing in complexity'.  This seems to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer the Universe is giving us when we ask &quot;what are you doing?&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This answer correlates well with many of the human moral systems that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have grown and prospered over the centuries.  Even now we, as humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are attempting to push the complexity of our environment and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves to ever greater heights.  This seems to be what the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe *does*, and as such, I suspect it is the Right thing to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My definition of Rightness makes a first stab at measuring sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions against-and-within this background of what the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving toward.  Although we are the universe measuring itself, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems circular, it is not.  It is just self-contained.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, Ben, I have you to thank for some of these ideas.  Please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pull them apart if you can, because I would love to get it Right ;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now you are positing a concrete meta-goal:
<br>
<p>** Find out the universe's implicit goal system, and adopt a goal system as
<br>
close as possible to the universe's implicit goal system **
<br>
<p>This is an interesting meta-goal....  And indeed, one that a superhuman
<br>
intelligence may be better able to execute than us mere humans.  Since our
<br>
brains seem to be having a pretty tough time finding out the universe's
<br>
implicit goal system !!
<br>
<p>But why is this meta-goal better than some other one?  There is still,
<br>
ultimately, a basic choice being made...
<br>
<p>One might wonder why the universe needs help in achieving its goals.  By
<br>
definition, it's going to do so anyway ;-)  Are we really helping it by
<br>
helping it &quot;achieve its goals even better&quot;???  Paradoxes of free will seem
<br>
to lurk inside your meta-goal....
<br>
<p>Personally, I do have a goal of increasing the amount of complexity &amp;
<br>
pattern in the universe, AND a goal of preserving human &amp; sentient life....
<br>
And I'm not so sure about your meta-goal.
<br>
<p>My son Zeb asked my dad once &quot;Ted, do you like me more than the universe?&quot;
<br>
Ted said ... &quot;Hmmm.  yeah, I'll have to choose you Zeb.  When you think
<br>
about it, the universe is kind of a mixed bag...&quot;  ;-)
