<em>&gt; I have an acquaintance who's a PR agent, and he basically does what you

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) A better understanding of how to phrase things so as to interest media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, who get WAY more story suggestions each day than they can possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act on.  Instead of one blurb on an idea, he'll create dozens of blurbs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrased specifically for different media people, based on his knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their different psychologies and interests.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I was just merely suggesting the direction, not the detailed
<br>
description of how to get there. It goes without saying that you would
<br>
create dozens of versions of
<br>
what you would like to communicate, depending on who you would sent it to. I
<br>
agree,
<br>
before you can send anything you would need a good knowledge of what your
<br>
targets
<br>
want. Then you would just give it to them (no lies, though), and hope for
<br>
the best.
<br>
<p>I would also like to point out that this kind of story suggestion
<br>
(AGI/Singularity) should stand out among others. Plus, if you send different
<br>
versions of your message to 30 places and do it, say, once a month, then
<br>
sooner or later one of them will perhaps be made into some article. Then,
<br>
when the remaining media targets are being contacted, the message could be
<br>
made more attractive if the reference to the already existing article on the
<br>
subject is made in it. Note, that such a reference would make the new
<br>
writer's job much easier.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) Most importantly by far: **An outstanding network of media contacts.**
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He knows a huge number of reporters and editors and producers personally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So when he has an idea he wants to publicize, he creats spiffy little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descriptions of his idea, and sends them to his contacts.  They know he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested good stuff to them before, so they read his stuff, unlike most
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the things people send their way.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, this is where professional PR agents have a huge advantage.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Without this kind of understanding and Rolodex, sending out press releases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at random is like sending unsolicited music tapes to music companies, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsolicited fiction manuscripts to book publishers.  It's hard to be heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among all the noise out there.
</em><br>
<p><p>True. The question is, therefore, whether the idea of contacting the media
<br>
should be abandoned. I don't think it should. If you consider that fear of
<br>
the unsolicited suggestions being rejected by media may eventually prevent
<br>
you from getting funding for AGI research, then I guess that contacting the
<br>
media makes sense after all. It's not pleasant or &quot;nice&quot; tactic but if it
<br>
helps in any way in the quest to bring about safe Singularity, then I think
<br>
I can live with it.
<br>
<p>One more thing. News media is not exactly a music or book publishing
<br>
company. If I report some event or development of relevance to the society,
<br>
then that's news, which is not in the same category as just another
<br>
unsolicited tape that nobody cares about.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, this particular PR guy I know charges $20K/month minimum,
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; I don't think he'll work for the Singularity or AGI for free...
</em><br>
<p><p>Hiring PR agents is therefore out of the question.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Among other campaigns, this guy did the PR campaign for the Republic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sealand (a bunch of freaks who took over an abandoned oil platform in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Sea, declared it their own country, and started a data haven there).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Among other things, he got them a cover story on Wired... which brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their data haven fuckloads of business...
</em><br>
<p><p>There you go :). Now if you were a writer for Wired and had two suggestions
<br>
for a story. One about &quot;a bunch of freaks who took over an abandoned oil
<br>
platform&quot; and the other about AGI research that may lead to Singularity,
<br>
which one would you want to write about?
