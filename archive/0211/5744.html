<em>&gt; One final comment, then. We already have two great sites on the internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Singularity, one at KurzweilAI, the other at Singularity Institute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The real goal of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;PR for funding&quot; is to provide the right links to the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people. To make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them want to go there, and read that stuff in the first place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as my promotion would go and I would be willing to do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; -----------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slawomir Paliwoda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Heartland
</em><br>
<p><p>SIAI is a great site, but it's definitely for radical futurist techie types
<br>
only, at this stage...
<br>
<p>Kurzweilai.net is a great site too, but it has a whole lotta stuff on it and
<br>
it takes some digging to get to the directly Singularity-in-a-nutshell type
<br>
info...
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.singularitywatch.com/">http://www.singularitywatch.com/</a> is also a pretty good Singularity site, I
<br>
believe
<br>
<p>What I want is a site that is simple, visual, direct, and makes the point
<br>
that the Singularity is coming in a way that any educated person can
<br>
understand within 10-15 minutes of surfing.
<br>
<p>The goal of the site I propose is simple: I want to get media type people
<br>
interested in the Singularity.
<br>
<p>SIAI's site does not do this very effectively.
<br>
<p>Kurzweilai.net does do this moderately effectively, but I don't think its
<br>
message is simply and clearly enough focused to serve the purpose I'm
<br>
thinking of.  [Though I don't doubt it serves the purpose it was intended to
<br>
serve, quite well.]
<br>
<p>SingularityWatch is a little more accessible than SIAI, but still is pretty
<br>
much for futurists only...
<br>
<p>Why get media type people interested in the Singularity?
<br>
<p>Because, for one thing, I suspect that will attract some good PR people to
<br>
do PR for the Singularity for the benefit of their own careers, without us
<br>
having to pay them for it...
<br>
<p>Creating an environment in which it's easier to obtain funding for AGI and
<br>
other Singularity-focused work is one high-level goal.
<br>
<p>Another high-level goal is to get more people involved in thinking about the
<br>
Singularity -- more young people to hear about AGI and thus perhaps work on
<br>
it, etc.
<br>
<p>Personally, yeah, I feel my work on Novamente is a tremendously greater
<br>
contribution to the Sing. than creating another website.  However, the folks
<br>
who have volunteered to help make this site, so far, are not people who --
<br>
because of skill set or inclination -- chose to volunteer to work on
<br>
Novamente.
<br>
<p>Creating AGI may be the most direct way to work toward the Singularity, but
<br>
other ways -- like helping create Singularity-focused websites -- are
<br>
important as well.
<br>
<p>About Internet versus print media and TV, there are many cases in recent
<br>
history of something springing from the Net into traditional media.  I think
<br>
if the profile on the Net is high enough, this can be accomplished.
<br>
Creating a higher profile on the Net is gonna be far easier for us than
<br>
directly invading other media (which are costly to penetrate directly)
<br>
<p>Finally, I certainly don't view &quot;another website&quot; as the ultimate solution
<br>
to Singularity PR.  It's just one little bit of the big picture, no question
<br>
there....  As I meet people at various events, I'm keeping my eye out for
<br>
folks with PR background who may be willing to donate some time/thought to
<br>
the Singularitarian cause -- keep your fingers crossed!!
<br>
