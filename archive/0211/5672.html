</em><br>
<p>The Novamente AGI project (www.realai.net) has a concrete research plan,
<br>
broken into definable steps with periodic milestones.
<br>
<p>We are not maintaining formal project-planning documentation for our AGI
<br>
project at this point, though we are maintaining such documentation for our
<br>
Novamente-based narrow-AI commercial software projects.
<br>
<p>It would be quite easy to put such documentation together, however, if there
<br>
were a need (such as a likely funding source).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This has the added benefit of allowing volunteers to step up to specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasks and perhaps donating skill and expertise as well as money.
</em><br>
<p>We are using volunteer software engineers (one full-time, a few other
<br>
part-timers); and we also have a full-time engineering team who are largely
<br>
devoted to Novamente-based commercial projects, but are along the way doing
<br>
some coding pertinent to the AGI effort.
<br>
<p>This is a lot better than making no progress at all, yet -- I can't deny
<br>
it -- it's a lot worse than having funding to pay a comparable team to work
<br>
on AGI full-time.
<br>
<p>The compensating factor is that the Novamente-based commercial projects are
<br>
also really interesting, though not as important in a grand sense as AGI.
<br>
(Our largest project, Biomind, involves applying Novamente to analyze
<br>
genetic and proteomic data.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I realize that research efforts often cannot be specific as to when or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if a given long-term objective will be accomplished, but the project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plan could list immediate 1-3 month goals, medium range goals 4-12 month
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals and long term.
</em><br>
<p>I, and many other AGI researchers, understand how to plan a project.  The
<br>
reason funding for AGI is hard to achieve is not that researchers in the
<br>
area lack software designs or organizational skills; the reason is that AGI
<br>
is viewed as an unrealistic, pie-in-the-sky goal by the scientific &quot;powers
<br>
that be.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am fairly new to the list and have read some postings regarding ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the AI, some regarding the funding, but thus far nothing has really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated to me how this large project is to be attacked.
</em><br>
<p>I have started an e-mail list called the &quot;AGI List&quot; that is more narrowly
<br>
focused on artificial general intelligence and means of achieving it.  Go to
<br>
www.realai.net and scroll to the bottom of a page and there's a place to
<br>
sign up, if you wish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me bring up another funding idea though.  Think of some aspect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the early project phases that could be made interesting to National
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Science Foundation.  It sounds like some of the principles here may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scientific credentials to pull off an NSF grant.  Doing a grant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposal does require enough of a plan to instill credibility but then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so does fundraising,
</em><br>
<p>I know of two other leading AGI researchers, besides myself, who had NSF
<br>
proposals rejected this year.
<br>
<p>The rejection letter for my proposal specifically stated that they were more
<br>
interested in funding proposals aimed at specific application areas, and did
<br>
not want to fund general intelligence research.
<br>
<p>My scientific credentials are not so bad, and one of the others whom I'm
<br>
referring to has very good scientific credentials also (he has more
<br>
mainstream AI publications than I do, but fewer publications overall)...
<br>
<p>Next year I'll submit an NSF application for bioinformatics work instead,
<br>
because I think that will have a prayer of success.
<br>
We're doing bioinformatics with our Novamente codebase, so if this work gets
<br>
NSF funding, it will indirectly benefit our AGI project.
<br>
<p>You have to understand the history of AI.  Too many AI researchers falsely
<br>
claimed they were just around the corner from creating a general
<br>
intelligence.  This happened so many times that now anything vaguely hinting
<br>
at general intelligence is greeted with scathing skepticism by the majority
<br>
of the AI research community and by the gov't research funding
<br>
establishment.
<br>
<p>Once there is a big, publicized proto-AGI success, the NSF will be all over
<br>
AGI with funding.  Not before.  That's my prediction anyway...
<br>
