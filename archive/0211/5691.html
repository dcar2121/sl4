<em>&gt; I'm interested in any and all potential early applications for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI - both to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluate the performance of our a2i2 system, and for possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any ideas?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Peter
</em><br>
<p>First, I have a general observation about early AGI applications.  Then I'll
<br>
try to answer your question..
<br>
<p>An advanced AGI will be able to observe a new application area, and figure
<br>
out how to apply itself to that area, and connect itself to other
<br>
appropriate software programs, etc.
<br>
<p>Until we're at that stage, setting up a concrete application of a proto-AGI
<br>
software system is a *lot of work*.
<br>
<p>There are two factors here:
<br>
<p>1) setting up any software application is a lot of work
<br>
<p>2)  Creating an AGI-based application can actually be more work than just
<br>
setting up a narrow-AI-based software application, even not counting the
<br>
work involved in creating the AGI system itself.
<br>
<p>The reason for 2 is as follows.  AGI systems are created for autonomy and
<br>
flexibility and nondeterminism, whereas in a software application context,
<br>
one often needs different virtues instead: repeatable efficient behavior in
<br>
particular contexts.  There is of course no intrinsic reason a software
<br>
system can't have both AGI virtues and software application virtues... but
<br>
in practice, early-stage AGI systems often aren't created with software
<br>
application virtues in mind.  We specifically architected Novamente so that
<br>
it could support both the autonomy &amp; flexibility &amp; nondeterminism required
<br>
for AGI, AND also so that one could create highly constrained &amp; efficient
<br>
Novamente-based software apps.  But not all AGI's will be this way; Webmind
<br>
AI Engine, for instance, did not have this property at all, and so building
<br>
practical apps on top of it was like pulling teeth (and we wound up
<br>
primarily pulling objects out of it to use in narrow-AI apps, rather than
<br>
actually using Webmind AI Engine in practical apps).
<br>
<p>So, my experience is, it's possible to make a simple prototype application
<br>
of an AGI system in a particular area by having a strong programmer work on
<br>
it for 6 months or so.  But to actually  make an AGI-based product that can
<br>
be sold or used in some domain, is a huge amount of work, even more than
<br>
building an analogous product without AGI involved.
<br>
<p>Another bit of general wisdom, which you surely know already: The most
<br>
important thing is to pick an app area where you have a lot of domain
<br>
expertise....
<br>
<p>Now, having gotten that blather out of the way, what are good app areas for
<br>
AGI systems?
<br>
<p>We're now working in bioinformatics.  There are loads of subfields here...
<br>
we're working mostly on genomics &amp; proteomics data analysis.
<br>
<p>At Webmind Inc., we worked in computational finance, and information
<br>
retrieval (document categorization, document retrieval).  Big uses for AGI
<br>
here....  And in the info. retrieval case, one can often outperform existing
<br>
apps without any real NLP in one's system, just treating documents as
<br>
patterned character-sequences ...
<br>
<p>Gaming has been mentioned by Reason; I think gaming is an OK application if
<br>
one has a very fast AGI or if one has a gaming idea &amp; biz model that
<br>
supports running game-interacting AGI's on a server farm...
<br>
<p>System administration is a wide open market... in desperate need of smart
<br>
automation tools...
<br>
<p>Knowledge management is a huge market.  So many diverse DB's out there, with
<br>
incompatible DB schemas, waiting for a system to come along and reconcile
<br>
them ...
<br>
<p>Robot control is another big area.  Basic robot arm control issues are
<br>
handled by standard engineering methods.  But no one knows how to deal with
<br>
mobile robotics yet, hardly at all....  The problem with mobile robotics is
<br>
decision making based on data integration.  See Albus's work at NIST, on a
<br>
robot-controlled tank.  Very interesting.  this area is begging for AGI.  Of
<br>
course, the military applications may be disturbing...
<br>
<p>Data mining in general is in great need of AGI.  It is hard to make a LOT of
<br>
money as a datamining company, but plenty of small companies seem to survive
<br>
in this way, often via a handful of contracts with large firms.
<br>
<p>The biomedical area incorporates aspects of robot control automation,
<br>
datamining, and bioinformatics, knowledge management, and system
<br>
administration....  And you get to deal with a huge bureaucracy too ;)
<br>
<p>Well, I could go on further, but there's work to do ;)
<br>
<p>If anyone wants to explore one of these topics further, I'll be happy to do
<br>
so.
<br>
<p>Or, Eliezer, if you feel this thread wanders too far from SL4's intended
<br>
focus, we could move this to the AGI list.
