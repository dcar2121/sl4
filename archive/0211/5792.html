Dear Gordon,

<em>&gt; Morality is not arbitrary.  We didn't evolve some certain set
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage in differential reproduction, spreading as our
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In the context you have given, I would agree that human morality is not
<br>
arbitary.  Groups of humans (and pre-humans) competed and the more
<br>
successful groups prospered, the less successful dimished.   I would
<br>
characterise this as Human Evolved Morality (HEM).  Although HEM is still
<br>
involved in many aspects of society and human interaction, IMO it nolonger
<br>
determines the success of the genepool, and hasn't for some time.  Should we
<br>
then discard HEM as mere baggage?  Perhaps not, because right now it is all
<br>
we have.  We are in the process of taking over our own evolution, and that
<br>
includes the evolution of our morality.  I am certainly dead set against
<br>
letting 'survival of the fittest' determine were we will go from here,
<br>
because offensive capability has far outstripped defensive.  In this
<br>
situation it is the most ruthless, or the most rapacious that will win the
<br>
game - or perhaps lose it for us all.  One of the purposes of creating FAI
<br>
is to restore the offensive/defensive balance by bringing in greater
<br>
intelligence as a player.  Now the question may be asked (I asked it ;) do
<br>
we give FAI our current HEM and nothing else?  Will this lead to the optimum
<br>
results?  Will this give good results at all?  Sure, HEM may be a good
<br>
start, but what comes after?  And how do we know its better?
<br>
<p>(Note: These questions are not rhetorical... I really am searching for
<br>
answers)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Universal Morality looks arbitrary to us.  If it's there for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason, it doesn't seem to be inside the Universe, but maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm just being shortsighted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can't see very far either.  How about we build a Morality Detector?  ;&gt;
<br>
