<p>This is not a correct understanding of Universal Morality.  The 
<br>
morality humans know intuitively comes from an evolutionary adaption.  
<br>
If you look at any animal, it has certain limits on what it considers 
<br>
acceptable behavior.  A baby bird that acts strangely will get thrown 
<br>
from the nest, or a wacky human will be outcast from the tribe.  The 
<br>
difference between humans and mice is that humans, unlike mice, can 
<br>
look at their minds and see a pattern of thought called morality which 
<br>
just refers to a set of mental processes that put limits on acceptable 
<br>
behavior for the benefit of the organism's genes.
<br>
<p>The human idea of morality can only describe good and bad from a goal 
<br>
oriented perspective because human morals are limits that accomplish 
<br>
the goal of better genetic reproduction and this shows through in human 
<br>
understanding of morality.  Look at Zoroastrism.  God gives out moral 
<br>
prescriptions with the goal of having people help the good spirits 
<br>
fight the bad spirits, and if you fail you will, in the Last Judgment, 
<br>
be cast into Hell, but if you succeed you will be in Heaven.  The point 
<br>
is, there's a goal involved:  help the good spirits defeat the evil.  
<br>
All moral systems used by humans are bound to goals.
<br>
<p>Universal Morality is something different.  It is not necessarily tied 
<br>
to the reproductive success of genes.  It is not a way to ask the 
<br>
Universe if you should do something.  If it exists, Universal Morality 
<br>
is the set of limits on acceptable behavior of processes, both 
<br>
accidental and nonaccidental, in the Universe.  Further, it is not goal 
<br>
oriented.  Something is good or bad because that's how it is.
<br>
<p>Of course, another possibility is that universes are differentially 
<br>
reproducing or bound by some other BPT emergent force, in which case 
<br>
morality might evolve or develop much as it did in humans, in which 
<br>
case the idea of Universal Morality is fiction.
<br>
<p>Also, don't confuse Universal Morality, the morality of a universe (not 
<br>
&quot;the morality used by a universe&quot;), with a universal morality, or a 
<br>
morality that exists in all nonaccidental processes.
<br>
<p>Getting back to Friendly AI, if no morality exists on the universal 
<br>
level, this is not a problem.  The normative morality of all life in 
<br>
the universe should suffice.
