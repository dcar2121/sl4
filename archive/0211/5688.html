<em>&gt; &gt; It sure is an inconvenient constraint that theories actually be true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isn't it?  Science is very useful and it needs more funding.  We need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sell Science.  Well, Science would have so much easier a time competing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with astrology if we could just get rid of all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental evidence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and focus on finding theories that are more dramatic and easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understandable to the audience.  Let's get rid of that Newtonian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gravitation thing and replace it with angels.  People like angels.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yet... it was a popular theory, we got to be really famous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and yet somehow, even though Science has more funding than before, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isn't really accomplishing as much as it was earlier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the progress of science is actually exponentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerating, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like the progress of technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Modern science on the whole is working rather well, in spite of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bureaucratic inefficiencies of the funding process, and in spite of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; temporary closed-mindedness in variosu particular areas.
</em><br>
<p><p>OOOOPSSS!!!  DUUUHH!!
<br>
<p>I see, I didn't read that part of your message carefully before replying.
<br>
<p>You were posing a hypothetical scenario in which gravity was replaced with
<br>
angels, and saying that in that hypothetical world, science would progress
<br>
more slowly.  I agree.
<br>
<p>But you're making an extreme analogy...
<br>
<p>A better analogy may be the Human Genome Project.  This was very well
<br>
publicized, and very well funded.
<br>
<p>Now, many of the scientists involved probably realized that, as the HGP was
<br>
being publicized, not enough emphasis was being placed on the limited
<br>
scientific value of the sequenced human genome, *in itself*.  Popular
<br>
articles on the HGP seemed to imply that once the genome was sequenced, a
<br>
lot would be understood.  This overemphasis on sequencing served to draw a
<br>
lot of funding to sequencing.
<br>
<p>Now that the sequencing is done, the research community has moved on to
<br>
collection &amp; analysis of gene expression data, proteomics, and so forth.
<br>
These things build on the completed human genome sequence, and eventually
<br>
they really will lead to an understanding of how the genome codes for an
<br>
organism.
<br>
<p>My point is that, if the HGP publicists had focused on the post-sequencing
<br>
work in proteomics and gene expression, they never would have gotten so much
<br>
funding for HGP.  It was by selectively focusing on more palatable truths
<br>
(&quot;We can sequence the whole genome!  In just a few years!  The complete
<br>
genetic code!&quot;), that they managed to raise the funding to get the HGP done.
<br>
<p>Excellent PR, there, in the service of a very worthwhile goal....
