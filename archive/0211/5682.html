<em>&gt; Yes, in order to create a message that would resonate with people, one needs
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Transition Guides, Singularitarianism, or boring AI technical details you
</em><br>

<em>&gt; that &quot;FAI could save people from dying&quot;. That's basically how the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; well........ you get the idea. If anybody is interested enough, the FAI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; websites would provide the further details.
</em><br>
<p>Dumbing down the Singularity for &quot;the masses&quot;... is that really what an 
<br>
FAI would do?  It doesn't seem very compassionate.  Or very honest.  Or 
<br>
very effective.  I have seen newbie Singularitarians try to spin the 
<br>
Singularity for what they fondly imagine to be the lowest common 
<br>
denominator, and I have never once seen that trick work.  All that happens 
<br>
is that the real message - the message that originally produced the 
<br>
Singularitarian - is lost out in a morass of unconnected technical details 
<br>
and unsupported noncredible assertions.  If you're saying things that you 
<br>
genuinely believe, somewhere in there will be things that even other 
<br>
people may find to be worth believing.  If you're trying to be 
<br>
manipulative, saying things you think are real clever and that will really 
<br>
pander to those stupid masses, you will make amateurish manipulative 
<br>
statements that will instantly be filtered out by an audience trained to 
<br>
resist the highly experienced manipulation of the trained professionals. 
<br>
Is the solution to get more practice at manipulating people?  No.  That 
<br>
high a competence at manipulation takes too much evil.  There's no way 
<br>
those skills could be employed at that level while keeping the essential 
<br>
message of the Singularity intact.  Remember that we are not here to make 
<br>
ourselves famous.  We are here for the Singularity.  If you make yourself 
<br>
famous and lose the Singularity that is anti-progress.
<br>
<p>It sure is an inconvenient constraint that theories actually be true, 
<br>
isn't it?  Science is very useful and it needs more funding.  We need to 
<br>
sell Science.  Well, Science would have so much easier a time competing 
<br>
with astrology if we could just get rid of all that experimental evidence 
<br>
and focus on finding theories that are more dramatic and easily 
<br>
understandable to the audience.  Let's get rid of that Newtonian 
<br>
gravitation thing and replace it with angels.  People like angels.  And 
<br>
yet... it was a popular theory, we got to be really famous and everything, 
<br>
and yet somehow, even though Science has more funding than before, it 
<br>
isn't really accomplishing as much as it was earlier.
