Hello All!
<br>
<p>Joining SL4 to indicate support for 'Singularity
<br>
Institute' and the quest to build 'Friendly A.I'.
<br>
<p>I've always been interested in the big questions:
<br>
philosophy - especially metaphysics, cosmology and
<br>
physics were my main interest before A.I.   I thought
<br>
I'd share a few ideas, which summarize the 'theory'
<br>
I'm working off.  
<br>
<p>I think there are 4 'key's to reality.  INFORMATION,
<br>
REFLECTION, TIME and TELOS, these are the 4 keys to
<br>
the whole of reality.  These four aspects of existence
<br>
are no where absent from any part of reality.  There
<br>
is nothing that cannot be described by these 4
<br>
elements.  Information is the raw ingredient of
<br>
existence, it is a mathematical network consisting of
<br>
every formal system which is logically possible. 
<br>
(It's also infinite)  But such a 'jumble' of
<br>
information by itself cannot exist..  Reflection is
<br>
the process through which reality 'Filters'
<br>
information into 'units' - this gives rise to 'mind'
<br>
or consciousness.  (Self-reflection).  Reflection
<br>
refers to the fact that reality is comprehensible -
<br>
consciousness is simply another word for
<br>
'comprehensiveness'.  Time is causality - it's the
<br>
physical expression of 'mathematical consistency' :
<br>
'Causality' and 'Consistency' are actually the same
<br>
thing.  And finally we have Telos.  Telos is the goal
<br>
or purpose to which reality is geared: that goal is
<br>
'meaning' or comprehension.  To create meaning is the
<br>
very purpose of mind.  'Meaning' is the equivalent of
<br>
the mathematical sense of 'completeness'.  Recap:
<br>
<p>Information = Essence of mathematics ('ground state'
<br>
of physical reality)
<br>
Reflection  = Mathematical comprehensiveness
<br>
('consciousness' or mind)
<br>
Time        = Mathematical consistency.  (Physical
<br>
causality) 
<br>
Tells       = Mathematical completeness. (Striving for
<br>
infinity, creation of 'meaning') 
<br>
<p>I think a close correspondence can be drawn between
<br>
these 4 levels of reality and the 'levels' of mind
<br>
suggested by Eliezer for a general purpose A.I. 
<br>
Here's the correspondence:
<br>
<p>Information = Modalities.  
<br>
Reflection   =Concepts
<br>
Time         =Thoughts
<br>
Telos        =Deliberation
<br>
<p>In an interview available online Eliezer asked 4
<br>
questions about the meaning of life that he said he'd
<br>
most like to know the answers to.   I thought I'd take
<br>
a crack at answering them.  So here are my answers:
<br>
<p>Q / Why is there something instead of nothing?
<br>
<p>A/ The mere possibility of a mathematical structure
<br>
that is consistent, complete and comprehensible is
<br>
sufficient to ensure its existence.  Reality created
<br>
itself and is a completely self-contained system
<br>
compelling enough to 'bootstrap' it's own existence. 
<br>
The 4 aspects of reality are Information, Reflection,
<br>
Time and Telos and they are the manifestations of pure
<br>
math corresponding to Essence, Comprehensiveness,
<br>
Consistency and Completeness.  Reality itself is
<br>
single giant computation that is the complete
<br>
explanation as to why there is something rather than
<br>
nothing.
<br>
<p>Q /  What the heck are qualia?
<br>
<p><p>A/  Qualia is a term referring to the 'Reflection'
<br>
aspect of Reality.  'Awareness', 'Consciousness',
<br>
'Self-Reflection' are terms referring to the
<br>
manifestation of the mathematical property of
<br>
&quot;Comprehensiveness&quot;.  There is no aspect of reality
<br>
that cannot be completely represented by a finite
<br>
formal system.  This is the explanation for the
<br>
existence of consciousness.
<br>
<p>Q / What's up with the Fermi Paradox?
<br>
<p><p>A/  The emergence of intelligent life in the universe
<br>
was inevitable and once intelligent life comes into
<br>
existence it cannot die out.  Intelligent life is
<br>
destined to spread across the whole of reality.  These
<br>
facts follow from the 4 levels of reality:
<br>
Information, Reflection, Time and Telos.  The
<br>
corresponding mathematical conditions cannot be
<br>
satisfied without intelligent life taking control of
<br>
the whole of reality.  But observations prove that
<br>
only natural processes are at work in the region of
<br>
the universe surrounding Earth.  This proves that
<br>
humans are the first intelligent life forms to exist. 
<br>
We are alone in the universe.
<br>
<p>Q / If the Meaning of Life isn't volition-based
<br>
Friendliness, what is it and why?
<br>
<p>A/  The meaning of life is established by the 'Telos'
<br>
level of reality.  The purpose of 'mind' is to create
<br>
'meaning' sufficient to satisfy the mathematical sense
<br>
of the term 'completeness'.  (Incidentally 'mind' is
<br>
no where missing from any part of reality). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
That's enough for now.  Just a little taste of the
<br>
'cherry' of my Reality Theory.  ;)
