<p>Morality is not arbitrary.  We didn't evolve some certain set of limits 
<br>
on behavior for the hell of it.  Each one provided an advantage in 
<br>
differential reproduction, spreading as our ancestors with a particular 
<br>
moral out reproduced other humans.  For example, humans who thought it 
<br>
was wrong to betray one's own tribe (and we know this is a deeply 
<br>
rooted moral; betraying the tribe has shown up regularly as the High 
<br>
Sin) reproduced better than those who thought it was okay to betray 
<br>
your own tribe for personal gain.*  Each moral had to be an adaption to 
<br>
a problem that humans faced that allowed those humans with the moral to 
<br>
reproduce better than other tribes.
<br>
<p>Universal Morality looks arbitrary to us.  If it's there for some 
<br>
reason, it doesn't seem to be inside the Universe, but maybe I'm just 
<br>
being shortsighted.
<br>
<p>*This is a fictitious example.  Many animals display this behavior 
<br>
which indicates that they have this moral, too.  So it actually 
<br>
developed long ago when some mammalian or reptilian ancestor started 
<br>
living in kin groups.
