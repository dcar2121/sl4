<em>&gt;Mitch noted:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;&lt;1. Cyber-Platonism: reality is made of 'formal systems'&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is a modification or variation to this thesis, that at the Planck or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sub-Planck level to the universe, by Stephen Wolfram, the basic particles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in actuality, programs. In essence, that programs are the ultimate basis of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This would capitulate your Cyber-Platonism, mayhaps?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what you mean by &quot;capitulate&quot;, but I would certainly
<br>
classify the idea that reality is made of computer programs as a
<br>
form of cyber-Platonism.
<br>
<p>Suppose fundamental physics turned out to be described by the
<br>
Game of Life. What would that mean? It would mean that the universe
<br>
was made of two-state entities which are causally coupled to each
<br>
other in a certain way. If someone wanted to say that such a
<br>
universe was &quot;made of finite-state machines&quot;, each running the
<br>
basic state-transition law as their &quot;program&quot; - I would find that
<br>
a lot more reasonable. But the idea that the universe is made of
<br>
software that has no hardware... it's like Pythagoras, &quot;all is
<br>
number&quot;. His heart was in the right place, but it would have been
<br>
more accurate to say &quot;All is particle&quot; or &quot;All is field&quot;, with the numbers 
<br>
playing a supporting role. I think our contemporary
<br>
attempts to make a fundamental information ontology are going
<br>
to require a similar compromise with materialisty before they get
<br>
off the ground.
