Quoting LOGI:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Matching imagery against stored memories is going to be very 
<br>
computationally expensive,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but...] One hopeful sign is the phenomenon of cognitive priming on 
<br>
related concepts
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Meyer71], which suggests that humans, despite their parallelism, 
<br>
are not using pure brute
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;force. 
<br>
<p>I would not be so hopeful here; the phenomenon might only be shifting 
<br>
the moment in time when the human is doing the brute force.
<br>
<p>The human might &quot;cheat&quot; by taking the test as follows: When she is 
<br>
given the first word (the priming word), she immediately does the brute 
<br>
force work of coming up with as many related words as possible, and 
<br>
then keeps as many in her short-term memory as she can -- in the hopes 
<br>
that some of these will show up later in the test.
<br>
<p>Then, when a word comes up later on, if it's in her short-term memory 
<br>
she recognizes the relationship immediately and thus her reaction time 
<br>
is reduced. Like a computer's cache, if a word is not in her short-term 
<br>
memory she must then resort to a hard lookup to determine whether there 
<br>
is a relationship or not.
<br>
<p>Obviously this caching is better than nothing as it reduces the number 
<br>
of times brute force is involved, but brute force is still ultimately 
<br>
involved at some point.
<br>
