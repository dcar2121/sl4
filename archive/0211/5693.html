<p>
Slawek,
<br>
<p>I agree with the basic PR approach you describe, but I'm afraid you
<br>
underestimate the amount of effort required to make a PR effort like the one
<br>
you describe actually work
<br>
<p>I have an acquaintance who's a PR agent, and he basically does what you
<br>
describe.  What he has that you and I don't, however, is
<br>
<p>1) A better understanding of how to phrase things so as to interest media
<br>
people, who get WAY more story suggestions each day than they can possibly
<br>
act on.  Instead of one blurb on an idea, he'll create dozens of blurbs,
<br>
phrased specifically for different media people, based on his knowledge of
<br>
their different psychologies and interests.
<br>
<p>2) Most importantly by far: **An outstanding network of media contacts.**
<br>
He knows a huge number of reporters and editors and producers personally.
<br>
So when he has an idea he wants to publicize, he creats spiffy little
<br>
descriptions of his idea, and sends them to his contacts.  They know he's
<br>
suggested good stuff to them before, so they read his stuff, unlike most of
<br>
the things people send their way.
<br>
<p>Without this kind of understanding and Rolodex, sending out press releases
<br>
at random is like sending unsolicited music tapes to music companies, or
<br>
unsolicited fiction manuscripts to book publishers.  It's hard to be heard
<br>
among all the noise out there.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this particular PR guy I know charges $20K/month minimum, and
<br>
I don't think he'll work for the Singularity or AGI for free...
<br>
<p>Among other campaigns, this guy did the PR campaign for the Republic of
<br>
Sealand (a bunch of freaks who took over an abandoned oil platform in the
<br>
North Sea, declared it their own country, and started a data haven there).
<br>
Among other things, he got them a cover story on Wired... which brought
<br>
their data haven fuckloads of business...
<br>
<p>-- Ben G
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; &gt; So, if anyone on this list knows any good PR agents who'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brainstorm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on ways to publicize the Singularity, please let me know ;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe I already suggested how one should go about increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awareness of AGI research or Singularity among potential donors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You locate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right media targets (specific magazines, newspapers, radio
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and TV shows,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internet sites) and then basically suggest them a story they would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in. You contact them and say or write something like:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;I have a great suggestion for a story for you about a growing field of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research that very few people know about, concerned with building
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial, self-enhancing, minds that could very soon be smarter than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note how short this line is (their time is precious too so you better not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste it), then how it refers to AGI &quot;field&quot; and not to the your specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research, since it gives your ideas more credibility and that you're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alone in your endeavor (as oppose to the some crazy scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working alone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the basement). Note also how it goes right to the point and how that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is presented with terms that everybody could understand. But most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all note how it is concerned with what you have to offer to the potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story writer, not what you want from the writer. It's their job to find a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good story that people would enjoy reading so assume that it your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their job. If you make it already attractive-- which is very important or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even crucial--and easy for them to write it, they will be more willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help you too. Who knows, you could even establish some relationship that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will result with some more stories in the future.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And that's the basic approach to the PR campaign, since it applies to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I would prefer not to use &quot;PR campaign&quot; term since it implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some huge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated or even expensive task that would necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interfere with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work on AGI. This is not so scary or time consuming or that it requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional PR agents. In fact this all could be done very cheaply and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiently with minimal effort. The benefits, though, could be enormous.
</em><br>
