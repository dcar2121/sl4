</em><br>
<p><p>I agree with the idea that it's important to make Singularity ideas
<br>
accessible to the general public, or at least to the
<br>
relatively-well-educated section of the general public (a category which
<br>
includes the wealthy individuals likely to donate to Singularity-focused
<br>
research).
<br>
<p>This is why I'm so happy with the work of Ray Kurzweil, who has done more in
<br>
this direction than anyone else in recent years.  He doesn't get everything
<br>
&quot;100% right&quot; in my view, but he brings his readers 90% of the way there,
<br>
which is a big improvement over the contemporary default mind-state...
<br>
<p>But I am not sure how to accomplish really dramatic public
<br>
&quot;consciousness-raising&quot; about the Singularity.  Publishing pop-science books
<br>
doesn't seem to do it -- even Kurzweil's books, which sell fairly well, have
<br>
not come close to transforming general public awareness.
<br>
<p>In thinking about how to bring Singularity ideas to the masses, I'm struck
<br>
by how savvy Kurzweil's approach has been, actually.
<br>
<p>Think about it: At minimum, we need the Singularity meme to make an impact
<br>
equal in magnitude to what the &quot;chaos and complexity&quot; meme has achieved over
<br>
the last few decades: Dozens of pop sci books, laudatory mentions in loads
<br>
of novels and films, college courses, etc.
<br>
<p>Why did &quot;chaos theory&quot; achieve the status it has, in the popular mind?  It's
<br>
a zingy name, and there's some real science there, but there was no huge
<br>
breakthrough really.
<br>
<p>One point is that chaos theory appeals to human intuition -- it tells us
<br>
that the world can't be completely understood after all.  It sends the
<br>
subliminal message &quot;It's OK to be confused, because chaos theory shows the
<br>
world is complex so it's impossible to understand everything.&quot;  Also the
<br>
message &quot;YOU yourself are too complex to be fully understood...&quot; which
<br>
everyone likes to hear.
<br>
<p>I'd say the same thing about &quot;quantum reality&quot; which has become a major
<br>
popular meme.  Thru the much-publicized (and half-substantial) ties to
<br>
Eastern religion, this meme makes people feel that their spiritual feelings
<br>
are in some sense scientifically valid.  Again there's a subliminal
<br>
feel-good factor.
<br>
<p>The Singularity on the other hand does not have this same
<br>
intuitive/emotional appeal to average humans.  It can't be spun as an
<br>
affirmation of life, nature or human common sense and intuition....  Chaos
<br>
theory and quantum reality have been spun to be comforting to the average
<br>
human -- but how do we spin the Singularity this way???
<br>
<p>It's pretty hard because, as I mentioned before, so many people are
<br>
religious, and the Singularity flies in the face of most religious
<br>
doctrines.  On the other hand, people have a remarkable ability to include
<br>
contradictory elements into their belief systems, including their religious
<br>
belief systems.  There is a spiritual side to the Singularity, which has
<br>
been discussed on this list at length in the past...
<br>
<p>I think that to excite the public about the Singularity we need to take a
<br>
pretty different focus than the one we take among a transhumanist crowd.
<br>
But what elements should we focus on?
<br>
<p>-- spirituality
<br>
-- improvements to life in ways that ordinary people can understand
<br>
<p>Wait a minute!! Those are exactly the things Kurzweil has focused on, e.g.
<br>
in &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot; ...
<br>
<p>Kurzweil's take is a lot more likely to convince the public than mine or
<br>
Eliezer's, because he tends to understate the potential for dramatic change,
<br>
assures people that the future will respect and perhaps even fulfill their
<br>
spiritual feelings and emphasize the possibility of living life
<br>
post-Singularity sorta as is, but better.  [A possibility that may well
<br>
exist post-Singularity, but if so, will be far from the only possibility.]
<br>
<p>And yet, his books have not caused a major popular meme like chaos theory or
<br>
quantum reality to emerge.  Perhaps it's just not time, in terms of the
<br>
state of mind if the mass psyche...
<br>
<p>Or maybe a crew of professional PR agents could come up with something
<br>
effective... who knows.  As good as Kurzweil's approach is, it's certainly
<br>
not perfect...
<br>
