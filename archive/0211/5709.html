</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I am not suggesting to ignore ethics, in pursuit of some goal.  Neither was
<br>
anyone else in this thread, so far as I can tell.
<br>
<p>I was suggesting that doing PR for the Singularity might be the best (*most
<br>
ethical*) course of action, even if it involves initially presenting aspects
<br>
of the Singularity to the mass audience in a carefully &quot;spun&quot; way.
<br>
<p>Acting ethically in a situation like this involves making complex judgments,
<br>
involving difficult tradeoffs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone can be ethical when nothing much is at stake.
</em><br>
<p>Well, actually, humans seem to very frequently be unethical (even according
<br>
to their own individual standards), in many cases where *very little* is at
<br>
stake...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  What makes a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularitarian is the ability to keep your ethical balance when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entire planet is at risk.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there are very difficult ethical decisions to be made here.  I respect
<br>
that you understand the seriousness of the decisions involved, and have
<br>
thought hard about them; but I don't always agree with your particular
<br>
judgments.
<br>
<p>I think your judgment that doing PR for the Singularity is unethical, is an
<br>
incorrect judgment.  On the contrary, I think it's unethical NOT to do our
<br>
best to do PR for the Singularity -- because doing this PR is the best way
<br>
to create the funding that will accelerate the creation of AGI, improving
<br>
the odds of a beneficial human-level AGI coming about prior to humanity's
<br>
self-destruction.
<br>
<p>I recognize that I don't have a bulletproof demonstration that my ethical
<br>
judgment is correct here.  There are many uncertainties involved.  It's
<br>
definitely a judgment call.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm curious.  What do you propose I should do about the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Novamente *would* destroy the world if it worked, given that you still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't understand Friendly AI?
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe your alleged &quot;fact&quot; is a fact.  So I don't think you should
<br>
do anything about it.
<br>
<p>I do have a somewhat different view of &quot;Friendly AI&quot; than you do.  I've read
<br>
all your writings fairly carefully, and discussed the issues with you
<br>
extensively, and I just don't agree with you on everything.  Sorry.  Your
<br>
views are forcefully and intelligently presented, and highly stimulating,
<br>
but in my view your arguments contain some major holes.  We've been over
<br>
this ground before and I suppose there's no point to rehash the details.
<br>
<p>I don't think *anyone* can understand as much about Friendly AI up-front,
<br>
prior to having near-human-level AGI's to study, as you think you understand
<br>
about Friendly AI right now.
<br>
<p>I think that there are going to be very difficult ethical decisions to make
<br>
regarding any AGI that becomes seriously intelligent -- and I think that the
<br>
nature of these decisions will become much clearer after the science and
<br>
practice of AGI are a little further along.
<br>
<p>Serious theories of Friendly AI will have to be formulated AFTER we have AGI
<br>
systems that have something like chimp-level AGI (to study and experiment
<br>
with), and BEFORE we have roughly-human-level AGI.  This means that once we
<br>
reach (to speak loosely) dog-level AGI, we'll have to start paying very
<br>
careful attention to some of the things you've been talking about
<br>
<p>-- monitoring intelligence increase in AGI's
<br>
-- ensuring there are good ways to control AGI's
<br>
<p>At this point, when none of us even has a dog-level AGI to show off and
<br>
study and experiment with, I think our time is better spent actually working
<br>
on AGI, rather than extensively speculating about AGI Friendliness, or
<br>
making accusations regarding the potential destructiveness of each others'
<br>
AGI projects.
