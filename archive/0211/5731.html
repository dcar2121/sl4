</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I often suspect that people look at these questions backwards (though 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not saying you Samantha). That they struggle with a question like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Should I commit suicide?&quot; as a separate question from &quot;What should I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do?&quot; Yet 'commit suicide' is an answer to this initial, fundamental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question whereas &quot;Should I commit suicide?&quot; is a question that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably just came up after internally hearing &quot;Awful feeling! Stop 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pain! Won't you please stop the pain? I matter!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess I know what your answer to the question is and you can guess 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I don't agree. I felt I should point out that it would be wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for anyone to struggle with this question by agonizing over whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their &quot;world is hell&quot; or whether they have no hope or how it will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affect family and friends, without ever considering whether they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agonizing over totally the wrong things (which I think they probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are). 
</em><br>
<p><p>&nbsp;From your wording I don't believe you have any idea what my answer to 
<br>
this question is or which question I asked myself to get over 
<br>
considering this possibility completely.   It became obvious to me back 
<br>
when I did consider suicide an option (decades ago) that no matter how 
<br>
much pain, frustration, helplessness and so on I might be feeling now, 
<br>
this world and this life was the &quot;only game in town&quot;.   All possibility, 
<br>
for ill or good, is here.    Even so-called afterlife models have one 
<br>
coming back to the same or worse until a different choice is made.   So 
<br>
it was rather obvious that &quot;Should I commit suicide&quot; is not the 
<br>
question.   However,  I don't begrudge any sentient the right to wrestle 
<br>
with their pain and options and decide so basic a question for 
<br>
themselves.  I would not presume to answer it for others.
