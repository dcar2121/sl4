<p>
For me, there's two aspects to Marc's theory: a set of broad
<br>
philosophical postulates, and then the detailed theory, the
<br>
specific logical-physical-cognitive correspondences he proposes.
<br>
<p>His postulates are
<br>
<p>1. Cyber-Platonism: reality is made of 'formal systems'.
<br>
2. Possibility, actuality, and necessity are all the same thing:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if you can exist, you do exist; and if you can exist, you must exist.
<br>
3. Metaphysical idealism as the criterion of possibility:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to be is to be represented in a mind somewhere.
<br>
<p>In my opinion 1), and very definitely 3), will prove to be on
<br>
the wrong track, while 2) might be true for all we know, but
<br>
it's a quite arbitrary supposition: no reason is offered as
<br>
to why *all* possibilities must be realized, rather than just
<br>
some, or none at all.
<br>
<p>I want to address what's wrong with 1) at some length, because
<br>
it's a very popular way of thinking among transhumanists.
<br>
Platonism has always been about focusing on the concepts we use
<br>
to understand things, and saying that they are all that is real.
<br>
Cyber-Platonism is Platonism 2.0, the use of materialistic
<br>
information-age concepts in a Platonic way.
<br>
<p>For example: the formalist interpretation of mathematics, which
<br>
says that mathematics is just a big game of meaningless symbols,
<br>
was invented to make materialistic sense of the subject, by tying
<br>
it to concrete things like notations on a page or bits in a
<br>
computer. These concrete games were the original 'formal systems'.
<br>
But ironically, we now have a new Platonism in which 'abstract
<br>
formal systems' play the role of the Platonic forms!
<br>
<p>It's worth remembering the philosophical context of the debate
<br>
over Platonism. The originating issue is the problem of the Many
<br>
and the One: what is this 'redness' that all red things share?
<br>
(Also known as the 'problem of universals': an individual red
<br>
thing is a &quot;particular&quot;, a property like redness is a &quot;universal&quot;,
<br>
and the question is, what sort of 'thing' is a universal?)
<br>
<p>In the medieval debates, there seem to have been three positions:
<br>
nominalism, Aristotelian realism, and Platonic realism.
<br>
<p>1. According to nominalists, 'redness' is just a name. There are
<br>
no universals, and all that links red things is how we name them.
<br>
2. According to Aristotelian realists, both particulars and
<br>
universals exist, and you can't have one without the other:
<br>
there are no 'propertyless things', or properties floating free.
<br>
3. According to Platonic realism, only the universals exist.
<br>
There are no things; or, things are somehow 'less real'.
<br>
<p>Cognitive science has given new life to nominalism, by going
<br>
inside the observer and describing the computation underlying
<br>
the act of categorization. A cognitive nominalist like George
<br>
Lakoff will ask: do we really think there is such a thing as
<br>
an 'essence of table', inhabiting all tables? Of course not.
<br>
'Table' is a fuzzy common-sense category, and whether an object
<br>
is a table is a judgement call made by an individual brain.
<br>
(You could also call this 'neural constructivism', by analogy
<br>
with 'social constructivism', which says that such categories
<br>
are social constructs.)
<br>
<p>But when we go to fundamental physics, the natural attitude to
<br>
adopt is some form of Aristotelian realism. The Standard Model
<br>
may or may not be true, but if it's true, it's true objectively
<br>
and absolutely. The 'upness' of an up quark is not dependent
<br>
on observer judgement, it's an observer-independent fact. You
<br>
can't really be a constructivist about the things out of which
<br>
brains and societies themselves are constructed. But that means
<br>
that the problem of universals returns in full force, without
<br>
any nominalist escape-hatch: what sort of a thing is upness?
<br>
<p>I hope it's clear that 'abstract formal system' is a universal:
<br>
it's the abstract pattern instantiated by each member of some
<br>
isomorphism class of concrete formal systems. And that should
<br>
in turn make it clear how odd it is to say that reality itself
<br>
is *made* of those abstractions, which we only know by way of
<br>
their instantiation in concrete systems. It would make more sense
<br>
to say that the universe is a concrete formal system, but that
<br>
would remove the argument for 3), metaphysical idealism.
<br>
<p>Anyway, enough of that for now. I want to turn to Marc's proposed
<br>
system of correspondences.
<br>
<p>Near the end of his book &quot;Shadows of the Mind&quot;, Roger Penrose
<br>
talks about the three interpenetrating worlds of mathematics,
<br>
physics and mind, and adds that &quot;No doubt there are not really
<br>
three worlds but *one*&quot;. Marc's system is a sort of impressionistic
<br>
unified model of the three worlds. He has three sets of four
<br>
concepts, one set for each world, each element in correspondence
<br>
with its neighbors:
<br>
<p>Modalities, Concepts, Thoughts, Deliberation (mental world)
<br>
Information, Reflection, Time, Telos (physical world)
<br>
Essence, Comprehensiveness, Consistency, Completeness (mathematical world)
<br>
<p>Or, to set it out as an ASCII mandala:
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MATHEMATICAL
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WORLD
<br>

<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/   /                                       \   \

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/                                                   \

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WORLD                                             WORLD
<br>
<p><p>Now, so far this is like the Kabbalistic Tree of Life; it's just
<br>
a network of concepts. To be judged as a theory, it needs to be
<br>
expanded into a set of propositions, expressing some systematic
<br>
relationship between the dozen concepts that he's picked out.
<br>
And when I look at it in that fashion, asking just what it is
<br>
that the links represent, I conclude that it doesn't add up.
<br>
Relationships that ought to be analogous are in fact dissimilar,
<br>
or indeed hardly more than chains of association (notably the link
<br>
between TIME and CONSISTENCY). Some associations are stronger than
<br>
others, but I don't think this is the deep structure of reality
<br>
on display just yet.
<br>
<p>Still, I wouldn't abandon it entirely. The planets don't move
<br>
around the sun in circles, but they do move around it, and the
<br>
introduction of a seemingly ugly idea - that they move in
<br>
off-center ellipses - led eventually to the inverse-square law
<br>
of gravitation. There might be the tip of a similar iceberg
<br>
hidden somewhere in the diagram above.
