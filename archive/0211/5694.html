<p>R&gt; The military and the gaming industry (and the military gaming industry) are

R&gt; ripe for something that commoditizes AI in the game sense. By this I mean
<br>
R&gt; customizable, highly abstracted decision making and knowledge
<br>
R&gt; representation/processing tools. Everything is roll-your-own, which is an
<br>
R&gt; insane state of affairs if you stop to look at it. Let's take the gaming
<br>
R&gt; industry: as much effort goes into AI (human simulation, essentially) in
<br>
R&gt; your average game as goes into the 3D engine. 3D engines are commoditized,
<br>
going for $50k -&gt;&gt; $300k per game license. The space is competitive. Why are
<br>
R&gt; people still building their own AI (human simulation) code from scratch each
<br>
R&gt; time? It's certainly not anything to do with complexity or level of
<br>
R&gt; customization required...
<br>
<p>As far as gaming goes this is not really accurate.  The AI is very
<br>
limited, mainly because of processing time constraints, it is very
<br>
gametype- and engine-specific (different for RTSs, FPSs, etc.) and it
<br>
is not being built from scratch each time: with Unreal's UT2K3 engine, for
<br>
instance, licensees get the AI code right along with the 3D engine
<br>
code.  A general &quot;human simulation&quot; package would at this point be far
<br>
too costly to run, resource-wise.
