<em>&gt;&gt;Hmm.  Better check this out with Computability Theory and existence in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;finite universe.  Also consider some of the logical conundrums implied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;by &quot;perfect knowledge&quot;.   There will never be an entity with &quot;perfect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;knowledge&quot; and &quot;infinite processing power&quot;.  So why base an argument on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;such even as a useful model.  Models containing logial contradictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;are not generally useful except to prove the model is faulty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For exactly the same reason that thinkers in the physical sciences usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start with idealized models that only roughly correspond to the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The first step to constructing a fundamental theory in a given field is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strip away all the messy details of the real world and try to isolate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential problem you are trying to grapple with. Once you've got a handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on how to deal with the simplified, idealized version of the problem, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can go back and try to solve it again with the realistic complications.
</em><br>
<p>Even if you create a model that is logically inconsistent?  You 
<br>
cannot isolate the eseential problem by throwing out essential 
<br>
parts of the problem.  Only the relatively unimportant mass of 
<br>
detail should be removed or a logical consistent analogue to the 
<br>
real problem created.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case, it is interesting to note that many of your objections to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idealized model also point to failings of real human ethical systems. After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, how many existing systems explicitly acknowledge and try to deal with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issues like limited information, uncertainty about the effects of actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and finite planning time? It also becomes obvious, in the face of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrealistic complexity of fully solving even the ideal case, that any system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useable by humans has to be more like a set of handy heuristics than a list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of inviolate universal principles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Perfect&quot; knowledge is a logical absurdity.  Do you deny this? 
<br>
If so please show how it is possible.  Information will always 
<br>
be limited, finite rather than infinite.  Planning time will 
<br>
always be finite.  Even a full blown AGI Power does not work by 
<br>
magic pixie dust that can do even the logically impossible.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;From a Friendly AI perspective, especially, I think this is a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive way of approaching the problem of ethics than the traditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human &quot;let's lay down some universal rules that sound good&quot; method. Arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about what list of rules is best doesn't work out well, whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmers are doing it or the AI is trying to figure it out internally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because there is no clear way to compare them. OTOH, trying to build a real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that approximates the performance of the ideal one as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible is a clear-cut engineering problem that allows different approaches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be tested against each other, and their pros and cons weighed in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful fashion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Your approach is utterly unworkable so it cannot be said to be 
<br>
&quot;more productive&quot;.
