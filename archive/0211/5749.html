<p>
I recently received an offer of sanctuary (living space) in Sacramento, 
<br>
CA, starting in February.  If nothing else turns up in the way of 
<br>
Fellowship renewal, I'll probably take up that offer, in order to conserve 
<br>
my resources as long as possible.
<br>
<p>However, one question that's been on my mind since even before then is the 
<br>
*ideal* location for the Singularity Institute.  To give you an example of 
<br>
how I've been thinking, here's how Sacramento would scope out:
<br>
<p>1)  Most major advantage - within a 2-hour drive of Silicon Valley, 
<br>
including San Jose, San Francisco, and Palo Alto.
<br>
<p>2)  Cost of living - 2.3% higher than Atlanta.
<br>
<p>3)  Immediate safety, according to a preliminary online check - no 
<br>
earthquake problems, no recent civil unrest.
<br>
<p>4)  Long-term safety - not an A-list city for a smuggled nuke or other 
<br>
weapon of mass destruction, but as the capital city of a major state, not 
<br>
off the list entirely, either.  Probably better than Atlanta, but nowhere 
<br>
near perfect.  Inside the USA, which is probably not the safest place in 
<br>
the world right now.
<br>
<p>Australia, probably the most commonly mentioned candidate, has a low cost 
<br>
of living, is democratic, doesn't seem likely to be targeted by terrorists 
<br>
with weapons of mass destruction, would probably be the nucleus of revival 
<br>
after nuclear war, etc., but their immigration requirements seem very 
<br>
strict.  It seems like the kind of place the Singularity Institute might 
<br>
want to move to after growing some, if we had sufficient funding, but not 
<br>
a good place to start.
<br>
<p>Undoubtedly the best location in a purely symbolic sense would be 
<br>
Antarctica, but the cost of living would be rather high.
