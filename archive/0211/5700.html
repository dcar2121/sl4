<em>&gt; You're placing too much trust in your moral intuitions.
</em><br>
<p>That's the only heuristic I have. Besides, it's more like common sense.
<br>
Perhaps, I will acquire some new and better heuristic in the future, but now
<br>
I'm stuck with this one which in this case tells me very clearly what needs
<br>
to be done.
<br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; Generally, if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral compromise instinctively seems like a good idea, it's because in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ancestral environment that moral compromise would have promoted your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *personal* reproductive fitness.
</em><br>
<p>I don't doubt that, except I don't see any compromise here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not a coincidence that the moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromises that seemed to Stalin to promise the greatest good for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatest number ended up with Stalin as tribal chief and all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed beneficiaries miserable.
</em><br>
<p>It's convenient to apply the principles of communism to the morality of its
<br>
leaders, but I'm afraid that Stalin didn't start his &quot;career&quot; with the aim
<br>
of providing the greatest good for the greatest number. Anyway, in the
<br>
absence of a compromise discussing this further would be just an unnecessary
<br>
distraction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to your moral intuitions like compromising the message at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heart of the Singularity seems like a good idea, something that would work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to promote the Singularity, and certainly not anything that you are doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the sake of personal fame.
</em><br>
<p>Promotion of the Singularity is not important. Is it shocking? It shouldn't
<br>
because this ought not be about Singularity. Devoting any more time to this
<br>
empty concept would be like those heuristics that assigned the highest value
<br>
to themselves (that I vaguely remember). This is not even about AGI/FAI, but
<br>
what humanity might be like in the future. If your microwave oven could do
<br>
exactly the same things for humanity what FAI could, then the goal should
<br>
still remain the same. Then you would be concerned with microwave ovens, and
<br>
then, maybe Singularity, except if you accomplished your goal without
<br>
technological Singularity, then why would you still care about this event?
<br>
Now, assume you can't talk about Singularity at all, and think of your
<br>
message. Would it still make sense? It should. Otherwise it needs
<br>
adjustment.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Why does it seem like a good idea?  Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an empirical generalization from the history of postagricultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; societies?  Are you modeling the detailed effect of your moral compromise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on millions of interacting people in order to predict the outcome of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex social and memetic system?  Of course not.  It seems like a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea because fifty thousand years ago, people who thought it was a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea tended to end up as tribal chiefs.  In the domain of politics, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means to an end intuitively seems like a good idea to the extent that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carrying out that means would have served the purposes of your genes in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hunter-gatherer tribe, not to the extent the means would achieve its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed end in our far more complex culture.
</em><br>
<p><p>So this is why. But what if this is the only right way. Then you would have
<br>
the answer with two solutions. Just because one solution is implied to be
<br>
derived from &quot;bad&quot; sources, doesn't make the same answer that could be
<br>
obtained by following the other solution less right. Again, another
<br>
distraction.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It *is* a famous empirical generalization from the history of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postagricultural societies that people who start out by making moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromises in the service of their ideals usually end up not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplishing anything toward those ideals, although their adaptations may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or may not) operate in accordance with ancestral function to place them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in positions of personal benefit.
</em><br>
<p>There's a mechanism of attachment by which the author's mind forms a strong
<br>
bond to his ideas comparable to a parental instinct between a parent and a
<br>
child. The connection is so strong that severing it would be considered
<br>
harmful to the whole existing structure. Meanwhile, this is just an
<br>
illusion, but the mind is unable or unwilling to notice, so it tries to
<br>
protect the bond at all costs even though it might have the capability to
<br>
observe that whatever it is connected to so strongly might be just an empty
<br>
space.
