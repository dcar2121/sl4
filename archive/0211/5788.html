<p>For exactly the same reason that thinkers in the physical sciences usually
<br>
start with idealized models that only roughly correspond to the real world.
<br>
The first step to constructing a fundamental theory in a given field is to
<br>
strip away all the messy details of the real world and try to isolate the
<br>
essential problem you are trying to grapple with. Once you've got a handle
<br>
on how to deal with the simplified, idealized version of the problem, then
<br>
you can go back and try to solve it again with the realistic complications.
<br>
<p>In this case, it is interesting to note that many of your objections to the
<br>
idealized model also point to failings of real human ethical systems. After
<br>
all, how many existing systems explicitly acknowledge and try to deal with
<br>
issues like limited information, uncertainty about the effects of actions
<br>
and finite planning time? It also becomes obvious, in the face of the
<br>
unrealistic complexity of fully solving even the ideal case, that any system
<br>
useable by humans has to be more like a set of handy heuristics than a list
<br>
of inviolate universal principles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From a Friendly AI perspective, especially, I think this is a more
</em><br>
productive way of approaching the problem of ethics than the traditional
<br>
human &quot;let's lay down some universal rules that sound good&quot; method. Arguing
<br>
about what list of rules is best doesn't work out well, whether the
<br>
programmers are doing it or the AI is trying to figure it out internally,
<br>
because there is no clear way to compare them. OTOH, trying to build a real
<br>
system that approximates the performance of the ideal one as well as
<br>
possible is a clear-cut engineering problem that allows different approaches
<br>
to be tested against each other, and their pros and cons weighed in a
<br>
meaningful fashion.
