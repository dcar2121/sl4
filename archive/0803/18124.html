<em>&gt; To put it differently, being able to have future experiences is one of my most important goals, and

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree that for many people, including me, &quot;being able to enjoy
<br>
future experiences&quot; seems important at an emotional level.  But I
<br>
think that the only reason it seems so important is because of a
<br>
particular illusion that humans have, which is very common... and even
<br>
I admit to falling for it most of the time.  This is the illusion that
<br>
there is a clear difference between &quot;self&quot; and &quot;environment&quot;.... or
<br>
said another way, that there even *is* such a thing as the self.  I
<br>
know it sounds like I'm getting kind of &quot;zen&quot; here, but I really think
<br>
that this is something that will ultimately turn out to be false.  I
<br>
just don't think there is any real meaning to &quot;personal identity&quot;,
<br>
besides the utility you attach to being able to control future events.
<br>
<p>The way I look at it, I care about my &quot;future self&quot; (or more
<br>
accurately &quot;future selves&quot;) only because we have a lot in common and I
<br>
have a lot of influence on him.  Not because I think we are the same
<br>
person.  A person to me is defined by a particular sequential history
<br>
of memories.  Every sequence is a different person, even if two such
<br>
sequences share a common past.  So the question of whether I will get
<br>
to &quot;enjoy experiencing the future&quot; is already tautologically false by
<br>
my definition.  I *know* that I won't be around in the future... the
<br>
person who I am now will be very different by then.  Even if I just
<br>
believed in a single timeline, that person would still have a lot of
<br>
new experiences and see the world through different eyes by then, just
<br>
as I see the world through different eyes than my past selves did.  So
<br>
strictly speaking, it cannot be said that I will ever have any more
<br>
experiences than I've already had.
<br>
<p>This is something that has always bugged me about a lot of
<br>
immortalists.  It seems like a big motivation for many immortalists is
<br>
that they want to &quot;keep on experiencing&quot; things.  But to me, that's
<br>
silly.  You can't keep on experience things... but you can affect the
<br>
future.  I'd like to radically extend my life, but only because I have
<br>
certain goals I want accomplished in the future and I don't trust
<br>
anyone else besides my &quot;future self&quot; to accomplish them.  Nor do I
<br>
think I can accomplish even a small fraction of them in a natural
<br>
lifespan.  In my opinion, my reasons for wanting life extension are
<br>
rational, whereas a lot of people want life extension for irrational
<br>
reasons (reasons based on the illusion of the self).
<br>
<p>So yes, on one hand you're right, it's &quot;how the mind works&quot;.  But I do
<br>
have hope that we can overcome that prejudice and get past it.  I
<br>
think I've somewhat done that for myself already... even though I
<br>
occasionally find myself retrapped by the illusion of the self.
<br>
<p>Jeff
