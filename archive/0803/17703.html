<p>You would be relying on an evolved intelligence having at least some
<br>
similarity with human intelligence, not an unreasonable assumption.
<br>
But there is no reason why the written language of an alien species
<br>
might not be, for example, based on the radioactive decay pattern of a
<br>
sacred stone, in which case to us a message would look completely
<br>
random.
<br>
<p>Similarly, an alien computer could seem to us completely rando. There
<br>
need not even be a causal connection between the subcomponents of a
<br>
computation. A virtual environment in which you experience Monday
<br>
could be run on computer A, and then Tuesday run on (completely
<br>
different) computer B in the Andromeda galaxy a billion years later at
<br>
one billionth speed. As far as you're concerned, you experience Monday
<br>
followed by Tuesday. You could be in a simulation in which every
<br>
second of experience is implemented on different hardware, at
<br>
different rates, different physical locations, in no particular
<br>
sequence, and you would have no way of knowing it. The shorter the
<br>
frames are, the more likely that a sequence of physical events
<br>
isomorphic to whatever hardware/software combination you specify
<br>
arises by chance.
