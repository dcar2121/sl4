<em>&gt;&gt; Surely this emulation &quot;really is&quot; your wife---it's just that she's been

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; But how do I know the AI chip really &quot;cares&quot; about her values, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just behaves as if it cares?  Isn't this the same situation as the actress?
</em><br>
<p>Not quite, because in the situation described, we are assuming that
<br>
the AI has no particular motive to do such a thing. And, more importantly,
<br>
it would be twice as hard to accomplish.  If you want to present someone
<br>
to the world, i.e. simulate but not emulate them, then the simplest thing
<br>
to do is just get them emulated in some algorithm.  Why add on the baggage
<br>
of an 'actor' one level higher up?
<br>
<p>That possibility did occur, however, in another context.  I suggested that
<br>
a benevolent AI may simulate someone if not enough information is
<br>
available to truly emulate that person, just as a kindness to friends and
<br>
relatives who may miss her.  She could even claim to have a bit of
<br>
amnesia, the AI helping the actor-software whenever it could. That's
<br>
the only motive I can think of for why an AI would really want to just
<br>
simulate someone if for less cost he or she could be emulated. Moreover,
<br>
we want and hope and pray that the AIs which take over are either us,
<br>
or as benevolent as we are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a simulation is just good enough to fool me, and emulation is perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computationally equivalent, then how would I know the difference?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, there isn't any way to know.
