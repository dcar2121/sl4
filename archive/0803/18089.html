Slawek, thoroughly and rightfully disgusted, simply writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; John K Clark:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Heartland, High Priest of the Unique Atom and Sacred Original Cult...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you know, this is an ad hominem attack. It doesn't add anything to this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion and you shouldn't have posted it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slawek 
</em><br>
<p>I totally concur. Heartland has said repeatedly that he is not attached to his
<br>
atoms. Just what is the point of the continued name-calling?  This is one of
<br>
those cases where *ridicule* adds absolutely nothing. As I said not long ago
<br>
in another thread, that although it can be tactically successful, ridicule is
<br>
not legitimate debating, ESPECIALLY BY THE MAJORITY!
<br>
<p>BTW, I just noticed only now that Heartland had made a slight change
<br>
to the subject line:   &quot;There's more to me than memories *but I won't
<br>
tell you what*&quot;.  Only the Omega Point knows why he won't.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Would anyone replying to this please remove the parenthetical
<br>
transistion phrase in the subject line?  Thanks.
