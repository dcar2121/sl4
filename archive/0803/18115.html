<p><em>&gt; Heartland has said repeatedly that he is not attached to his atoms. 
</em><br>
<p>He has been all over the map on this issue. First he tried to convince
<br>
me that atoms were not generic, talking about their “space time
<br>
trajectories” (a fancy way of saying atoms move); and I’m not talking
<br>
about just one post, he went on and on about it. When that didn’t work
<br>
he didn’t renounce his previous position but he did change direction
<br>
slightly and said it wasn’t the atoms themselves that was important but
<br>
the activity of those atoms. That was certainly an improvement but I
<br>
pointed out that the scientific method can detect no difference between
<br>
the same process happening to 2 identical atoms. I received to answer to
<br>
this devastating criticism.
<br>
<p>Mr. Heartland told me “Of course, the copy would &quot;feel&quot; that the
<br>
original subjective experience has been transferred successfully.
<br>
However, the point is that dead original wouldn't.”
<br>
Leaving aside the very obvious fact that if you THINK you’re dead then
<br>
you can’t be and if you THINK you’ve survived then you have I asked him
<br>
just exactly what was so original about “The Original”, and he soon got
<br>
back on the good old atoms express. He can deny it from now to next
<br>
month but it always comes back to atoms.
<br>
<p>By the way Lee I’m really curious, do you agree with Mr. Heartland that
<br>
anesthesia is equivalent to death?
