<p><em>&gt; I have a computer in front of me of bizarre alien manufacture which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulates a day in the life of an apple. I don't understand its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture and there is no I/O which would allow me to test it. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aliens all died when their sun went nova after they launched the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer into space. Even if we could find some sort of pattern in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal workings of the computer it is impossible to assign meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the pattern,
</em><br>
<p>Wait.  One of our apples?  The kind grown on Earth and presumably
<br>
throughout the galaxy?  If all the highly intelligent entities in our solar
<br>
system in the year 2300 were to focus on solving &quot;The Riddle of the
<br>
Alien Artifact&quot;, sooner or later one of them would notice that some of
<br>
the patterns embedded in the artifact are highly characteristic of (isomorphic
<br>
to).... an apple!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, does the computer still simulate the apple?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly.
<br>
<p>Besides, what is inherently true of an object does not depend on who
<br>
happens to have survived some nova somewhere, or upon any truly
<br>
external condition.
<br>
<p>(For example, it may be true of an object that it has the property
<br>
&quot;photons that bounced off it millions of years later affected a certain
<br>
distant photographic plate&quot;.  But that is not *inherently* true of the
<br>
object, although perhaps better words should be found.)
