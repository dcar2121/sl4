<em>&gt; &gt; The decimal expansion of pi looks random but contains any string of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; digits you care to nominate....it contains islands of structure hidden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the noise. If these islands of structure contain observers, they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be no less conscious for the fact that an observer outside the ensemble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can't find them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thats an interesting thesis, but somewhat akin to saying, isn't it, that my
<br>
DNA is aware since it contains the code necessary to generate me, given a
<br>
program to execute it. I dont think that information is akin to
<br>
consciousness, or even computation for that matter. The two are
<br>
fundamentally different processes.
<br>
<p>For example, if I were to swallow tetrodotoxin or some other neurotoxin, I
<br>
would quickly die, but the fundamental structure of my brain would remain
<br>
unchanged for some time. I dont think that 'I' would remain conscious until
<br>
my brain started to decay.
<br>
<p>similarly, if I were to describe the position of every atom in my body with
<br>
a specific number, that number would not exhibit conscious in and of itself.
<br>
but even if it did, are all the possibly polymorphisms of that digit
<br>
conscious in precisely the same way? a reversal of the number, subjecting
<br>
the number to any one of several information-preserving compression
<br>
algorithms, or reducing that number to its lowest possible KC value by some
<br>
means.
<br>
<p>Lets say though that somehow, an abstraction of my atomic structure/energy
<br>
is sufficient for consciousness, that such structure is conscious in and of
<br>
itself. What if we were to create n clones of me, utilizing this abstraction
<br>
as input into a program, lets further say that such clones are implemented
<br>
in a computer program, and all are subject to the same internal environment.
<br>
lets also say that each clone is housed in a small computer, maybe 10cm x
<br>
10cm x 10cm in size. its not important.  If we create several instantiations
<br>
of this program, several of these computers so to speak, and housed them in
<br>
the same building. would there only be one instantiation of consciousness,
<br>
given that its the same structure, even though each instantiation of this
<br>
structure is not causally interactive with any of the others, or are there
<br>
multiple consciousnesses?
<br>
<p>Rgds,
<br>
