<em>&gt;&gt; Also, it's vital because we can *discuss* whatever is objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You and I may discuss a distant nebula, and refer to it as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thing outside our skins, refer to it without any mention of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; subjective impressions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can do this because we both learned the same symbols for mapping our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experiences to the objective world.  When you use the word &quot;red&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand what you mean because it maps to my own subjective experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of red.  Via language acquistion, we've already implicitly agreed on these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mappings and don't have to renegotiate them each time we utter a statement.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. The process of adopting conventions and aligning them to objective
<br>
characteristics isn't so easy to describe, but I sense that we completely agree
<br>
here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can also discuss subjective experience, as evidenced by this thread.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same way that I cannot directly convey my experience of &quot;red&quot; to you, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot directly convey my subjective experience of &quot;subjective experience&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I rely on the assumption that youf experience something similar, and through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context and clarification you can infer what I'm talking about.
</em><br>
<p>Beyond the simple claim that it exists (which is true), what intellectual good
<br>
has ever come from discussing subjective experiences?  Has it ever added
<br>
anything to our knowledge?  Well---sure---some brain investigators have
<br>
been inspired from their own subjective experiences, but in Pan Critical
<br>
Rationalism useful inspiration may come from anywhere, even your local
<br>
witch doctor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Is my red the same as your red?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the purpose of communications, I suppose it doesn't matter.  When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say &quot;red&quot;, I know what you're talking about (that is, it consistently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invokes the same subjective experience), and that's what allows us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [Talk of subjective experience] also vastly add to the difficulties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in discussing consciousness and trying to get a handle on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; True, but we need a better reason than that to dispense with it.
</em><br>
<p>Addressed above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; To think of &quot;the big C&quot; as an objective phenomenon characteristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of some objects/entities---and not characteristic (or only very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; marginally characteristic) of others---makes possible scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; progress towards understanding.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely.
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But discussions of the subjective nature of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lead utterly nowhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From an armchair philosophy standpoint, that might be true.  While this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue may not be resolvable by our meat-brains, I propose that it's relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with regards to Friendly AI.  In fact, it could even be a key element of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friendliness.
</em><br>
<p>Certainly AIs wishing to emulate humans must of course take this
<br>
into account.  But that can be done, I submit, by following an 
<br>
entirely functional approach. Making a human that acts like a
<br>
human, quacks like a human, etc., will be good enough, because
<br>
except for grotesquely elaborate TEs involving computronium and
<br>
GLUTs, functionalism works just fine as a criterion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly, it's possible (in principle) that our mental constructs could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated to the extent they are objectively indistinguishable from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; originals, while at the same time eliminating the most important part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience.  (I.e., turning people into zombies).  We may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree on the likelihood of this, but no one can conclusively rule out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibility.  Similarly, one might argue, we can't rule out the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of gremlins or invisible elephants in the middle of the room, but there's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important difference in these arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have to find a reasonable balance between risks and consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the AI is wrong about the existence of gremlins or invisible elephants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the middle of the room, well, so what...  However, if it's wrong about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experience and suddenly all of the lights in the universe go out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced by highly detailed but dark simulations of lights, what a horrible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shame that would be.  The risk is so unimaginably great that it's worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious consideration, even if we believe it to be unlikely.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  But I'll bet that a seriously &gt;H entity won't have any trouble
<br>
subscribing to practical functionalism. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I wouldn't want to stubbornly refuse new technologies, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teleportation, radical brain-tissue replacement, or even &quot;uploading&quot;, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could improve or extend human life, I also don't want to vanish into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oblivion while some doppelganger runs around claiming to be me.  For me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is a real concern and the jury is still out.
</em><br>
<p>People have been coming up with great scenarios to help us double-check
<br>
that a functionally successful upload---or robots subsequently downloaded
<br>
from its code---will leave us no excuse to think that they're not &quot;conscious&quot;
<br>
or have no &quot;subjective experience&quot;, any more than it is conceivable that, 
<br>
say, black people aren't conscious.
