<p><em>&gt;  I admit I haven't followed the whole thread.  But if you insist that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  consciousness exists, then you need a plausible mathematical model of it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  draw any conclusions.  Suppose you model a sequence of mental states S(1),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  S(2), ..., S(n) as strings or natural numbers N such that the information gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  between successive states, K(S(i+1)|S(i)) is small, but still larger than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  information loss, K(S(i)|S(i+1)).  An example would be a series of bit strings
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  where S(i+1) is formed by appending a random bit to S(i).  In this case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  K(S(i+1)|S(i)) = 1 &gt; K(S(i)|S(i+1)) = 0.  The inequality defines the direction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of perceptual time.  Furthermore, K(S(j)|S(i)) quantifies the perceptual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  experience that occurs from time i to time j.  The model is plausible because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  intelligent systems typically gain and lose information this way by evolving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  slowly over time.
</em><br>
<p>Typically, yes. I guess it's possible to have no net information gain,
<br>
or even net information loss over time, and still experience a
<br>
continuous stream of consciousness. But even in dementia, no mental
<br>
state will contain information that is contained in a subjectively
<br>
future state, even if the total information in a future state is
<br>
actually less.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If you accept this model, then it is possible to implement the scenario you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  described by ordering the states S(1) through S(n) using conditional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  algorithmic complexity to deduce the most recent state.  Also, there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  perceived interruption of consciousness because what is perceived during the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  transition is described by a small program P that inputs S(n) and outputs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  S(n+1) in a perceived time of |P|, no different than any other step.
</em><br>
<p>Does S(n+1) have to be generated by P from S(n) or is the raw fact
<br>
that S(n) and S(n+1) simply occur sufficient to generate subjective
<br>
continuity? Lee would argue that the causal link is important, I would
<br>
say that the moments of consciousness order themselves due to a rule
<br>
such as you describe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The model has some other interesting implications.  For example, it implies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the possibility of conscious experience in more than one dimension of time, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in a type of time where there is no clear distinction between past and future.
</em><br>
<p>Right: the direction, or even existence, of time in the real world (if
<br>
such there is) is irrelevant. S(n+1) could objectively precede S(n)
<br>
and it would make no subjective difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   In our directed one-dimensional model, it implies the existence of birth but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not death: it is not possible to not have experience because for every state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  S(n) there is an infinite sequence S(n+1), S(n+2) such that each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  K(S(n+i+1)|S(n+i)) is small.  (However, the sequence going back in time is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  finite.)
</em><br>
<p>What if each S has to be implemented on real hardware in a finite
<br>
single world cosmology? I don't see how you could fit in more states
<br>
by making the difference between them smaller and smaller, since at
<br>
some point there will be no subjective difference between one state
<br>
and the next.
