<em>&gt; &gt; 1). Your email's subject line is obviously misleading. The primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; concern is how to make Friendly AIs, not Friendly humans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Oh, come on  . . . . given that *no one* has an AI nor expects to have one this year, you have absolutely no excuse for being mislead by the title.  The *only* intelligent machine that I possibly could have implemented Friendliness on is a human being.  This is an intelligent first step to implementing it on a future AI.
</em><br>
<p>Humans and AIs have radically different cognitive structures. Trying
<br>
to implement Friendliness on both at the same time isn't going to
<br>
work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  How am I not addressing the/*your* primary concern?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How is the subject line misleading -- given that it is already longer than the visible field of my webmail page?
</em><br>
<p>My initial thought was that you had actually written out a technical
<br>
specification and tested it on working software.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Me thinks thou doth protest far too much.  Why does this bother you so much?  Are you afraid of being infected with a meme that enforces ethics?
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid of this list being infected with impossible Friendliness
<br>
architectures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; 2). Please provide some evidence to the list that you haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; committed any immoral acts since declaring Friendliness, which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; rather audacious claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  First, I have never made any claims about morals.  I do not agree with most proclamations that most people make when they start using the word morals.  The term is *ethics* -- many people might believe that they are synonymous but they have radically different connotations for many others.
</em><br>
<p>Point taken.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Second, about the only proof that I can provide is to declare that I have not *knowingly* performed any unethical acts since being fully infected and challenge everyone to prove any evidence to the contrary.
</em><br>
<p>Since none of us have any idea who you are or where you live, this
<br>
would be rather difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The problem with this &quot;proof&quot; is that I'd also say that I'm not sure that you could provide any evidence of me knowingly performing unethical acts in the last several *YEARS* -- so Friendliness hasn't visibly changed my personal *willingness* to act ethically AT ALL.  I was previously willing to act ethically and pretty much always did so (to the extent that I can't remember not doing so in the past several years) and I remain that way.
</em><br>
<p>One of Christianity's main principles is that everyone acts
<br>
unethically all the time. This isn't quite true, but it's plausible
<br>
enough, given most people's understanding of human cognitive
<br>
architecture. What makes you different from everyone else?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Third, I can't think of any other evidence I could provide.  Do you have any suggestions to help me?
</em><br>
<p>If you're intelligent enough to rewrite human architecture to that
<br>
extent, without the benefit of ultratechnology, you should be
<br>
intelligent enough to figure out how to provide evidence for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; 3). The fragility of this type of cooperative Friendliness has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; long since established in evolutionary biology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What cooperative Friendliness?  I'm not seeing any cooperation here at all.  I asked for assistance.  I said &quot;If you believe that this is incorrect, *PLEASE* free me by showing me where this meme is harmful and rid me of my infection.&quot;  You came back and attacked me for being misleading and then demanded proof that I was a good person.
</em><br>
<p>It only becomes cooperative when it spreads to a large group of
<br>
people, which (if I understand correctly) is what you're assuming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; The system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; vulnerable to anyone who wants to disrupt it. Mitigating this requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; a huge technological or power advantage, which we don't currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Prove your statement by freeing me of the meme or making me willingly perform an unethical act.
</em><br>
<p>I don't have to. If I'm powerful enough, I can simply *shoot you*.
<br>
Poof, there goes Friendliness.
<br>
