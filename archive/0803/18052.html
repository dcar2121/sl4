<p><em>&gt; Please excuse the top posting, but I agree with all the points that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for all the questions near the end of the post, they're interesting,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; on any of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please feel free to ask any again of them that are real (and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rhetorical) questions, and which vitally address whether memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merging is possible for close duplicats. It is reassuring :-) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you find memory merging of close duplicates (our subject line)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even less problematical than I do. And you gave good examples
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it IMO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the encouragement.  Hinges on = no =&gt; agreed.
<br>
<p>I find it difficult to phrase my thoughts in words because I tend to think
<br>
more in pictures and analogy.
<br>
<p>To give a more concrete (real &amp; not rhetorical) example:
<br>
<p>Today on my way home I took a slightly different path than usual, yet after
<br>
some meandering I found myself on a familiar road and continued from that
<br>
point along my usual route.  Suppose I make similar (yet each unique) small
<br>
detours each day for a week.  After the experiment you ask, &quot;How did you get
<br>
from work to home?&quot;  but you do not provide the specific context of a
<br>
particular day, or a particular travel method.  When I think of all the
<br>
routes I had used, they are a superposition of valid solutions- and they're
<br>
all correct solutions within the scope of the question.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask the same question to both me and my wife, then I might think
<br>
also of those routes she used to travel from her work to our home.  I did
<br>
not subjectively experience those routes in real-time detail, but I am still
<br>
capable of imagining them as solutions to the intentionally open-scoped
<br>
question.  I don't think these 'imagined' routes are difficult to include
<br>
within the sphere of possibility for how I did (or might have) get from work
<br>
to home.  There might have been a route enter my mind's view of possible
<br>
routes that I had taken months before I started this experiment.  I believe
<br>
that experience may or may not have happened (a third-party might have told
<br>
me how to imagine it) but it is still worth some possibility of correctly
<br>
answering the question.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy works here because the question itself does not limited by
<br>
time - so each of those serialized events are presented simultaneously as
<br>
possible answers.  I believe subjective experience of run-time in a
<br>
computation environment where the observation of time can be manipulated by
<br>
an external agent provides for a context switch, several processing threads
<br>
each deposit results into shared &quot;memory&quot; and a context switch back will
<br>
appear to those inhabiting the suspended environment that the results of
<br>
those independent threads have been computed instantly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I have some proficiency with SQL as a visualization for structured
<br>
information / thoughts.  Recent discussion of GLUT makes me think of
<br>
database concepts.  Given that database theory is essentially a scaled down
<br>
version of set theory, would it be acceptable to represent (for discussion)
<br>
these ideas in set theory terms?  (I admit to not having the rigid formalism
<br>
of Set Theory available as a natural language, but might it be worth the
<br>
effort?  Is that too domain-specific to have anyone make the effort?)
