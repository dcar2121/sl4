</em><br>
<p>I would disagree with this.  There is a lot of evidence that people
<br>
are &quot;programmed&quot; to believe in some sort of higher being, but a lot of
<br>
that programming may come from the evolutionary advantage of
<br>
&quot;following the leader&quot; in a tribe.  It's a part of a more general
<br>
tendency for us to respect/worship authority figures, whether it be
<br>
moral authorities or intellectual authorities, natural or
<br>
supernatural.  It doesn't mean there is any formal axiomitization of
<br>
God embedded in our DNA or neural pathways... it just means that we
<br>
are predisposed to certain beliefs because they fit better with the
<br>
way our brains work, and causes behavior that is more reproductively
<br>
favorable.
<br>
<p>Another point I think is important is that consciousness is just a
<br>
word, rather than a fully coherent concept.  Everyone has a different
<br>
opinion on what consciousness is, because everyone makes different
<br>
associations when they hear the word.  Utlimately, the ideas that
<br>
people associate the word with may have some correspondence to
<br>
something that works roughly like what the word consciousness entails,
<br>
but it also may turn out that the word just doesn't correspond to
<br>
anything in the actual world and it's just a manor of speaking that
<br>
evolved for some beneficial reason.  This is the question of whether
<br>
reductive materialism or eliminative materialism is a more accurate
<br>
description of the world.  My personal opinion is that it will be a
<br>
bit of both... consciousness probably corresponds to something that is
<br>
vaguely like what people are talking about when they use the word, but
<br>
probably different enough that it deserves to be replaced with a new
<br>
word/words entirely.
