</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, pi would contain only an infinitesimal proportion of the
<br>
computations underpinning any given physical reality, since there are
<br>
infinitely many transcendental numbers, as well as all the other
<br>
mathematical structures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Even if [Monday and Tuesday] occurred in separate Hubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; volumes with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; chance of information flow between them you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; experience Monday followed by Tuesday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but only if (to my way of thinking) there was any information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  flow going on.
</em><br>
<p>So if two computers implement Monday and Tuesday in isolation from
<br>
each other, i.e. purely by chance, there *won't* be subjective
<br>
continuity between them, while if two similar computers implement
<br>
Monday and Tuesday in a similar way, except the programmer set up
<br>
Tuesday having knowledge of Monday, there *will* be subjective
<br>
continuity between them? How is this discrepancy possible, if mental
<br>
states supervene on physical states?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; If every computation is necessarily implemented by virtue of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; status as a platonic object then there is no basis for saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; there is a separate &quot;real&quot; universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right. That's the main reason that I don't subscribe to &quot;platonic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  computation. That is, real computation---any computation worthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the name---must be driven by causality in which each state is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  causally derived from earlier state(s).  I don't believe in timeless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  computation, calculation, or consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>You have to explain how the computations know they are causally
<br>
connected, and not just accidentally connected. And in any case, the
<br>
parts of any random system, such as atoms in a gas jostling each
<br>
other, are causally connected.
