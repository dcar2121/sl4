&quot;I don't buy it.
<br>
<p>Friendliness has nothing to do with keeping AI out of the hands of &quot;bad guys&quot;.
<br>
Nobody, good or bad, has yet solved the friendliness problem.&quot;
<br>
<p>Right, I meant &quot;good guys&quot; as a very general term that refers to programmers who both understand the safety issues, and who are committed to building a safe, universally beneficial AGI.
<br>
<p>There is a danger from programmers/teams who aren't even aware of safety issues, and another (possibly smaller) danger from programmers/teams who understand the safety issues but who might seek to use the AGI for selfish benefits instead of universal benefits (eg. rogue governments, etc). It's easy to label as science fiction, but it's also not an impossibility.
<br>
<p>I think that as proto-AGIs develop we will gain a better practical understanding of AGI safety.

<br>
<p>Instances of OpenCog and Novamente would likely be peers in a distributed
<br>
query/message posting service like the one I proposed, or some other system
<br>
that manages the communication between billion of humans.  Their success will
<br>
depend on how well and how fast they judge the quality and relevance of
<br>
information in a hostile, competitive environment.
<br>
<p>As long as humans are the primary source of knowledge, the network will be
<br>
friendly because good service is a subgoal of the evolutionarily stable goal
<br>
of acquiring computing resources.  I estimate a network will be deployed over
<br>
the  next decade and it will remain friendly for about 30 more years.  As the
<br>
machines do more of our thinking, humans will become less relevant and the
<br>
interchange between peers will evolve from natural language to something
<br>
incomprehensible and beyond our cognitive abilities to learn.  Shortly
<br>
afterwards there will be a singularity.
<br>
<p>You cannot ignore that there is a US $66 trillion per year incentive (the
<br>
value of all human labor worldwide) to develop distributed AI.  I have seen
<br>
many proposals to build prototype friendly AI on a desert island, or otherwise
<br>
isolated or tightly controlled by its developers.  I hope you can see how
<br>
impractical these approaches are.  You can't compete with the computing power,
<br>
knowledge base, and user base already available on the internet.
