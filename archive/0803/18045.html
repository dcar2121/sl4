</em><br>
<p>This is an excellent question and it raises an important point.
<br>
<p>Typically, questions in the realm of objectivity can be addressed by
<br>
science, while those in the subjective realm are the province of philosophy
<br>
and religion.  However, the very concept of &quot;Friendly AI&quot; places us in a
<br>
strange realm where these two perspectives overlap in a relevant way.  The
<br>
notions of friendliness, ethics, morality, empathy, and the like, have both
<br>
objective and subjective aspects to them.  My personal morality is not based
<br>
strictly on evolutionary psychology or cultural programming, but in part on
<br>
deep reflection about subjective experience and the assumption that other
<br>
humans experience the same.  I suppose my morality boils down to recognizing
<br>
that my actions can impact other people's subjective experience and taking
<br>
responsibility for that knowledge.  In this sense, at least for me,
<br>
subjective experience is directly relevant to morality and friendliness, and
<br>
these issues are the whole point of this discussion group.
<br>
<p>Regarding your specific question:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; what intellectual good has ever come from discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experiences?
</em><br>
<p>I'm taking &quot;intellectual good&quot; to mean objectively testable theories leading
<br>
to practical knowledge, repeatable processes, or new and improved
<br>
technologies.  In terms of this strict interpretation, I'm inclined to agree
<br>
with you.  But this forum isn't strictly about intellectual good, and I
<br>
submit that the very prospects of uploading, teleportation, duplication,
<br>
functional equivalents of subjective experience, etc., make this topic more
<br>
relevant than it's ever been.
<br>
<p>In short, I suggest that the question of whether or not any intellectual
<br>
good can come from such discussions must take a backseat to the more
<br>
pressing question of whether any actual good can come from them.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Norm Wilson
