<em>&gt; &gt;  I had independently derived an order of magnitude estimate of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  content of the universe a few years ago using a different approach.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  estimated the number of possible standing wave patterns in a volume of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; size R
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  as a function of the mass-energy E = mc^2 in that space, which depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Planck's constant h.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know how you estimated it, but if you really got the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer it seems like it must have been pure coincidence.  The number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of standing wave patterns scales with volume, whereas the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bekenstein-Bousso bound scales with area.  The holographic principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies that there are a lot of hidden correlations between different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible standing wave patterns, because of their effects on spacetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself... making any estimate based on standing waves meaningless.
</em><br>
<p>Suppose you have some photons trapped in a torus of circumference R or a tube
<br>
of length R/2 with reflecting ends.  Each photon must have a frequency which
<br>
is an integral multiple of c/R, or an energy which is a multiple of hc/R or a
<br>
mass  which is an integral multiple of h/cR.  If the total mass is bounded by
<br>
m and you count the number of possible states and take its log, you get a
<br>
messy calculation whose result is about S = mcR/h (ignoring small constants). 
<br>
If you increase this to 3 dimensions (as a mirrored cube or hypertorus) the
<br>
result is multiplied by 3, which I'll ignore because it is unimportant. 
<br>
Adding particles with mass also does not substantially change the result.  A
<br>
massive particle can have more states (because it moves slower) but you can
<br>
have fewer of them.  Of course the universe is not a cube or hypertorus, but
<br>
this is only an order of magnitude estimate.  Also, the universe is expanding
<br>
so it doesn't have standing waves.  If you prefer, the number of states is
<br>
bounded by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle over time period T, and the
<br>
result is the same.
<br>
<p>Now if you let R = cT be the &quot;size&quot; of the universe of age T, and set R =
<br>
2Gm/c^2 to the Schwarzchild radius and solve for the mass of the universe m,
<br>
you get S ~ T^2 c^5/hG ~ 10^122, a unitless number.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  It is rather interesting that the volume of a bit is about that of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proton or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  neutron, but S does not depend on the properties of any particles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The area of a bit is 10^-69 m^2, which is roughly 1 Planck length
</em><br>
<em>&gt; squared.  There is no fixed &quot;volume of a bit&quot;, as the number of bits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not proportional to volume.  If you're just taking the volume of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe and dividing it by the volume of a baryon, it's not very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful, because you can definitely have a lot more than 1 bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside the volume of a baryon.  It's just that once you take into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account all of the weird gravitational correlations throughout
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spacetime, you find that there are less bits total than you'd expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a volume-based count.
</em><br>
<p>No, I divide the volume of the universe by S and get the volume of a baryon. 
<br>
S depends only on T, c, h, and G, not on the properties of baryons or any
<br>
other particles.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  It has always puzzled me why the universe didn't collapse into a black
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  shortly after the big bang if it had the same mass as today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A black hole is defined as a region of space from which light cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; escape.  Comparing the Schwarzchild radius to the radius taken up by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some amount of matter/energy is only a rule of thumb, not a hard &quot;law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of physics&quot;.  In particular, it only applies to static spacetimes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where space is not expanding.  When space is expanding or contracting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it provides other ways for light to escape.  In a universe with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dark energy, where the density of matter is less than the critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; density, space will expand forever, and there will be no event
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horizons (black holes) and light will not get trapped in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular region.  If the density of matter is greater than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critical density, then the universe will eventually collapse back onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself and &quot;big crunch&quot; which I suppose you could regard as similar to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a black hole but as far as I know it's not usually called that.
</em><br>
<p>Dark energy doesn't explain why the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
<br>
It is just an observation.  It seems to me this behavior should be explainable
<br>
in the framework of Einstein's field equations.
<br>
<p>Likewise, inflation does not explain the uniformity of the cosmic microwave
<br>
background.  To me, it is a kludge.  Maybe the big bang didn't start with a
<br>
single point.  I mean, how do we know it did.
