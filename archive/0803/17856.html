<p><em>&gt; As Nick commented, I don't see how the history of how the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states came about could have anything to do with the ensuing mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I agree.  It doesn't.  Sorry if I gave a wrong impression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How could you possibly know if your Monday and your Tuesday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were implemented on separate computers a zillion light years apart or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in neighbouring rooms?
</em><br>
<p>Right.  You couldn't know.  Grasping for where I think we're
<br>
disagreeing, what I object to is the chopping up of the entire
<br>
Monday/Tuesday affair into a sequence of states not causally
<br>
connected. And that means locally, and locally computed.
<br>
<p>If Tuesday takes place in a galaxy far, far away, and the initial
<br>
configuration of Tuesday arises by chance, say, (or from a
<br>
record of a previous execution), then there is only an infinitesimal
<br>
loss of consciousness:  namely, the instant between Monday and
<br>
Tuesday.
<br>
<p>I hope that made my position clear on your Monday/Tuesday TE.
<br>
