</em><br>
<p>The case I was thinking of is where the pairs overlap: Sa-&gt;Sb, Sb-&gt;Sc,
<br>
Sc-&gt;Sd,... . It seems that you would allow this set of states
<br>
continuous consciousness. Granted, it is less likely that these pairs
<br>
of states arise by chance in dust clouds and so on than that
<br>
individual, unconnected states do, but it doesn't seem enough of a
<br>
difference to banish consciousness from wherever it wasn't
<br>
deliberately intended.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; I still haven't understood your position on information flow over a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; there an interruption in consciousness if the correct information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; used?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No interruption.  Just like the sudden and miraculous appearance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of Sir Francis Bacon in an exact state that he really did occupy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the 1600s. It really is him, and he didn't lose even an infinitesimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bit of consciousness, because this is a case of  ...-&gt;Sd-&gt;Se-&gt;Sf...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in the 17th century followed by the sudden  Se-&gt;SF-&gt;SG-&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in the 20th century, where caps are used, partly, to indicate his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  astonishment!  Because Se really happened back then and Se
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  also happened in the 20th century, his consciousness was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  interrupted in the slightest.
</em><br>
<p>The operator of the first machine notes its final state, and transfers
<br>
this state plus another unrelated state to the operator of the second
<br>
machine - not telling him which is which. The second operator inputs
<br>
one of the states into his machine and it just happens to be the
<br>
correct one, so no interruption in consciousness, right? (Whereas if
<br>
he had input the wrong state a completely different computation would
<br>
have resulted, so obviously total disruption of the stream of
<br>
consciousness would have resulted).
<br>
<p>Now, suppose the first operator transfers the final state of his
<br>
machine *as well as* every other possible state, again not telling
<br>
which is which, and the second operator just happens to choose the
<br>
right state to input. Is there interruption of consciousness? There is
<br>
information transfer of sorts in that the correct state has been taken
<br>
off the first machine and is known to the first operator, but it is
<br>
completely hidden in the noise. The first operator may as well tell
<br>
the second operator to try all the different states in turn. Do you
<br>
think there will be continuity of consciousness if the first operator
<br>
tells the second operator to try each possible state in turn, but
<br>
*not* if the second operator tries each state in turn on his own
<br>
initiative, without any communication from the first machine?
