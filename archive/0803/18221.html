<em>&gt;&gt; I don't currently see any harmful effects.  I am seeing (possibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incorrectly) *many* PROFOUNDLY beneficial effects.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Such as?
</em><br>
<p>I am enjoying myself spectacularly.
<br>
<p>I've been learning new and useful things about myself.
<br>
<p>My wife is REALLY happy.
<br>
<p>My wife is REALLY happy despite the fact that I outran her over 6.5 miles for the first time ever (I can always out-sprint her but over the longer distances she normally physically kicks my butt).
<br>
<p>I've gotten much more effective at life.
<br>
<p>It actually wasn't a big deal when our hot water heater ruputured and flooded our basement.
<br>
<p>I saved myself a lot of money by just walking out after Home Depot insisted on overcharging for after-market add-ons for my hot water heater.
<br>
<p>I saved myself $50 when buying from Lowe's because I handled it particularly well and made them make good on a bad estimate
<br>
<p>I seem to have converted from a functional extrovert (i.e. a native introvert who can be an extrovert when appropriate -- but it's an effort) to a native extrovert.
<br>
<p>I've been getting comments at work like: 
<br>
o  What has Julie been feeding you?  I've never seen anyone get so much done -- and you're having fun doing it.
<br>
o  No.  There is no way that you got all of that done.
<br>
o  You're having way too much fun this week.  I'm only excusing it because of how much you've gotten done (said by the &quot;boss&quot; as what he considers a joke :-).
<br>
<p>I feel really good.
<br>
<p>Did I mention that I am enjoying myself spectacularly and my wife is REALLY happy?
<br>
<p>And that's just this calendar week -- which is only half over.
