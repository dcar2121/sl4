Stathis writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  I claim that isomorphic copies separated enough in spacetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to constitute separate physical processes are separate subjects.
</em><br>
<p>BTW, the word &quot;subject&quot; here is so prone to miscommunication
<br>
that I've withdrawn the sentence, in accordance with a post by
<br>
Mikko who complained &quot;This is rather nonsensical to me.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Suppose that there is an absolutely identical you being held
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in an Earth-like simulated city near Sirius.  It ought to matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to you that one of them is going to shortly die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that there are two separate subjects, but I don't agree that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it matters if one of them dies. This is because, if you're the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that dies, it will seem to you that you continue to live in the one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that survives.
</em><br>
<p>Naturally, I oppose the construction &quot;if you are the one that dies&quot;
<br>
because I consider you to be both of them. As you know, I
<br>
think that it's possible to be in two places at the same time,
<br>
just as it's possible to be at two times in the same place. (We
<br>
simply need to get used to the idea.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you disagree with this, then you should consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destructive teleportation to be suicide.
</em><br>
<p>Sequence of events in what I think you mean by destructive
<br>
teleportation. (This includes the more shocking case of
<br>
Teleportation With Delay.)
<br>
<p>1. You step into the booth in LA and are scanned.
<br>
2. The information is sent to New York, where, using
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different atoms, a duplicate you is created that is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identical to the person (object)  that was scanned
<br>
3. The LA original sees his duplicate in NY walk out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the NY booth, and knows that he-in-LA will be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disintegrated in 30 seconds (after the transfer has
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been triple checked for validity).
<br>
4. The LA original sweats profusely if he's not up to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed on all this (IMO), because always before
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his memory he walked out of the remote booth.
<br>
5. The LA original is disintegrated.
<br>
<p>Why would I mind traveling like that?  I'm used to the ideas,
<br>
and while I-in-LA would be surprised (of course) to find
<br>
his instance still in LA, I-in-LA would say, &quot;oh well, no
<br>
biggie, the I-in-NY will wake up in my bed tomorrow,
<br>
and, according to every possible objective criterion, is
<br>
none other than me (despite the difference of a few seconds
<br>
of memories).&quot;
