</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I survive under the transformations that people normally think of as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival. But the point is that this depends on my psychology rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than being something basic to physics.
</em><br>
<p>So if someone says &quot;I will survive the upcoming thermonuclear
<br>
explosion, because the fused metal on the ground will really
<br>
be me&quot;, I suppose all you can do is shrug your shoulders and
<br>
say, &quot;Well, each to his own&quot;.  There isn't any objective fact
<br>
of the matter whether a given person has survived a transformation.
<br>
<p>You're giving up too easily!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can try to come up with an objective criterion for survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as &quot;all copies are selves&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>That is *not* a criterion!  That is a claim, though.
<br>
<p>The criterion is sufficient similarity of structure, just as for
<br>
everything else. An object is a rabbit if its DNA is close
<br>
enough, and if it is morphologically close enough. Naturally
<br>
there is no precise dividing line, but please don't say that
<br>
anyone is free to call anything a rabbit (without being
<br>
very, very wrong, absolutely wrong).
