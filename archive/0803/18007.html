</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; that would be the same as a deliberate Monday computation

<em>&gt; Eh?  The cosmic ray strikes at 12:00 midnight = 12am Tuesday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock</a> .   :-)  Just to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sure that we are talking about something after the last state on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Monday and before the first state on Tuesday.
</em><br>
<p>I think we may be talking about slightly different things. To restate
<br>
the problem, we have two separate computers which are going to run
<br>
Monday and Tuesday, respectively, of a person's life. If the final
<br>
state of Monday is transferred to the second machine, by any reliable
<br>
means, so that Tuesday can be computed, then my understanding is that
<br>
you would agree that there is no break in the stream of consciousness
<br>
of the person being simulated (assuming he is staying up late). On the
<br>
other hand, if the run on the second computer starts with initial
<br>
state not causally connected to the first computer, even if by chance
<br>
it turns out that this starting state is in fact the one that would
<br>
have occurred had the causal connection been present, then your claim
<br>
is that there will be a discontinuity in consciousness between Monday
<br>
and Tuesday.
<br>
<p>My problem with this latter position is that, apart from being an
<br>
unnecessary complication, there is no way to specify what counts as a
<br>
causal link and no obvious mechanism whereby the absence or presence
<br>
of this link could affect the consciousness of the computation. For
<br>
example, what happens if the transfer of information occurs by a
<br>
friend passing you a number of files of which only one is the correct
<br>
one. If you guess right does that count as information transfer? What
<br>
if your friend tells you which is the right file but you're not
<br>
completely sure you believe him? What if you implement a series of
<br>
computations using all the files, knowing that one of them has to be
<br>
the right one?
