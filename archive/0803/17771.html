</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course I believe in my own experience or qualia.  But there is a difference

</em><br>
<p>Outside mathematics, you can't prove *anything* at all!  So what
<br>
good is such a complaint?  I think it's a big mistake to try to depend
<br>
in any way upon absolute certainty.  It's an illusion.
<br>
<p>We have *conjectures* that stand up to criticism (see Pan Critical
<br>
Rationalism) <a href="http://clublet.com/why?PanCriticalRationalism">http://clublet.com/why?PanCriticalRationalism</a>, 
<br>

<br>
(apologies if you already are familiar with PCR).
<br>
<p>All knowledge is conjectural.  Any time you try to complete the sentence
<br>
&quot;He knows that...&quot;, &quot;She knows that...&quot;, or &quot;I know that...&quot;, what is
<br>
&quot;known&quot; is only a conjecture.   We believe those conjectures that have
<br>
withstood the test of time, i.e., have withstood a lot of criticism.
<br>
<p>In any real situation, you know that your mother has experiences,
<br>
and if you love anyone then you deeply care about their experiences.
<br>
In daily life, the fact that they do experience is important to you (unless
<br>
you're a psychopath).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't make any argument that a robot couldn't make.  
</em><br>
<p>True enough.  But what the robot says is either so, or it's not so.
<br>
If you don't know how advanced the robot is, you don't have any
<br>
idea of whether or not it has experiences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I suppress my evolutionarily programmed beliefs and analyze the question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logically I have to conclude that either a robot experiences or I don't.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the common sense meaning of the word, humans experience and machines don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But do animals?  Embryos?  Terminally ill Alzheimer's patients?
</em><br>
<p>It's a sliding scale.  We know that some entities are what we call very
<br>
conscious, that other entities are (we think) much less so, and that
<br>
embryos are hardly conscious at all, any more than, say, your arm is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Eventually robots could have &quot;inner lives&quot; as complex as ours or more,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; when one day they have enough intelligence/consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do you measure complexity?  How many bits are required for consciousness?
</em><br>
<p>A lot, but we don't know enough yet to put a lower bound on it.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A program like autobliss ( <a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt">http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt</a> )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulates reinforcement learning.  Would it be moral to run a version of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program capable of learning more complex functions?  Suppose I add episodic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory, i.e. it can recall the training sequence?  Where do you draw the line?
</em><br>
<p>It's not easy.  Since it's still only 2008, we have to do a lot of guessing.
<br>
But if it passes the Turing Test, if it interacts with people in other satisfactory
<br>
ways, then the safe bet is that it would be immoral to run the program if
<br>
it complains or if we think it's suffering.  There is no certainty, of course.
