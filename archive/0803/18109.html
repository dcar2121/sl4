<br>
Noone would be your own closer duplicate than your closest multiverse
<br>
cousin.
<br>
I suppose you could merge with him.
<br>
That being done, your cousins cousin would not be a far fetch from there.
<br>
So on and so on.
<br>
Until you reach maximum intellectual entropy ? The total collective
<br>
consciousness of an intellectual state beginning at a given point in time?
<br>
The concept just makes next to little sense to me .. I mean, to what end ?
<br>
You'd have to have a fundamental, instinctive, understanding of at least the
<br>
4 dimensions and problary qm's to cope with this sort of multi-awareness...
<br>
and again, to what end ??

<em>&gt; &gt; Well, could you have snipped a lot of the foregoing I wonder?

<em>&gt; &gt; In addition to your ghastly HTML, I'm having some trouble here

<em>&gt; &gt; knowing what we've agreed to and what we haven't, and, alas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have not been snipping very conscientiously myself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; P.S.  Sorry, as I explained, for not snipping more. It will be a miracle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if anyone bothers reading this whole thing except you and me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry about the html, I thought I had turned that off in gmail.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably also explains why so few of my posts get responses.  Thanks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the reminder.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we've agreed to many things.  That's my seriously snipped summary.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm happy to clear the slate and focus on this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand there may be value in retaining atomic details of every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transaction.  The transaction record may be later mined for further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns that were not observed from an initial investigation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I offer this scenario:  Your wife asks how your day was.  You say, &quot;It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was fine&quot; (because you really don't care to relive your day to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the details)  You then realize that what she was really asking was,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Are you going to ask me about MY day&quot; so you reciprocate with, &quot;And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how was your day?&quot;  Now tell me, what amount of data do you record
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the next 20 minutes of downloading she attempts to convey?  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe you would in-principle say that you have recorded every nuance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of that 20 minutes.  You might honestly say that you absorbed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant bits and could tell me the &quot;gist&quot; of it were I to ask you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She probably would say you weren't paying attention at all.  OK, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know if you have a wife or are a good listener, etc.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrived in 2nd person so you might more easily identify with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the physical universe real-time has an effectively unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution and bandwidth (granted: a debatable assumption)  You face
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death of your human body.  You can be uploaded with the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limitation on technology.  The bandwidth to memory is a fixed constant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (let's say due to electromagnetic storage constraints).  However, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwidth bringing data into your 'brain' can exceed the bandwidth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory by several orders of magnitude (it's 100% optical)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you tune your input rate down in order to accurately &quot;remember&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything you perceive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
