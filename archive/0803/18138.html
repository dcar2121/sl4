<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  so many many places (assume for a moment our Level One universe

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  raised to 451 degrees Fahrenheit) can't make a difference, can it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; No, I'm not being emulated by rocks, rocks and I are both being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; emulated in Platonia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I recoiled in shock. Suddenly, I didn't know what was going on. What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is emulating what?  How?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (I now rather think, by the way, that Stathis maybe should have said &quot;No,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'm being *implemented* in Platonia&quot;.  And he might have corrected my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  usage by something like &quot;Lee, no, I'm not being emulated by a rock,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the rock and I are on an equal footing, we're both being *implemented*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in Platonia&quot;.  Of course, I don't know yet if that's what Stathis might really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  have thought or agreed with.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, OK: the simulation or the emulation is being implemented on a
<br>
computer somewhere, maybe the big Turing machine in Platonia. But if
<br>
there's no &quot;original&quot; do we call it a simulation or an emulation? We
<br>
do refer to virtual worlds as &quot;simulations&quot; even when they aren't
<br>
actually simulating anything; can we than have an emulation of a
<br>
simulation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  So I will continue to insist that the goal of uploading is to emulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a human consciousness, not simulate it, and we need some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of terminological distinction for this, if not the one I've been pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  on this list and Extropians for five or ten years.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But apparently there are some, such as Jeff L. Jones, who would
<br>
work hard to overcome this bias. I think that that would be like
<br>
working hard to overcome a fear of death.
