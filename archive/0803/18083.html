</em><br>
<p>I readily confess to having changed my mind back and forth
<br>
over the years about this. At one time I'd write about memories
<br>
*and* dispositions, behavior, etc., and then later re-think the
<br>
whole thing and decide it was better to go with just memories
<br>
(for *precisely* the kinds of reasons involving memory 
<br>
swapping being discussed between Heartland and me).
<br>
<p>Hmm. What do we really have here?  We have a very complicated
<br>
human organism, which we might suppose the human component
<br>
of which is entirely located in the brain. (I'll gladly argue against
<br>
Damasio on that point, for example.)  Due to our primitive understanding
<br>
we often break the mentality or neural behavior into &quot;emotional&quot; vs.
<br>
&quot;rational&quot;, &quot;memories&quot; vs. &quot;behavior&quot;, etc., to pick some not very 
<br>
good examples.
<br>
<p>I would argue that changing all one's memories for someone else
<br>
would induce immediate and noticeable behavioral changes.
<br>
Perhaps not while telling the world's most well-known joke,
<br>
but certainly for explaining why the U.S. went into Iraq. In
<br>
one case the memories could well give rise to different behavior
<br>
mediated by the emotions involved.
<br>
<p>Okay---I've substituted &quot;behavior&quot; for &quot;personality change&quot;.
<br>
I take the hit.  To a very *large* degree one's personality 
<br>
might not be affected much by swapping memories with 
<br>
someone.  I don't really know.
<br>
<p>But here is the *crucial* part that may even rescue my
<br>
claim about &quot;personality changes&quot;, or at least minor ones:
<br>
<p>Heartland would very soon notice apparent changes in
<br>
behavior of his friend, if for no reason that &quot;I&quot;---that is,
<br>
Lee in Heartland's friend's body---would not know
<br>
Heartland personally, and my facial expressions would
<br>
not match those that his friend had acquired while he
<br>
and Heartland got to know each other.  Heartland could
<br>
immediately surmise, perhaps incorrectly, that his friend's
<br>
personality traits had undergone a change.
