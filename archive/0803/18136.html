</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I admit to falling for it most of the time.  This is the illusion that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  said another way, that there even *is* such a thing as the self.  I

<em>&gt;  know it sounds like I'm getting kind of &quot;zen&quot; here, but I really think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that this is something that will ultimately turn out to be false.
</em><br>
<p>It is, already, patently false if you are looking for &quot;objective
<br>
truth&quot;. The definition of self, and the distinction between self and
<br>
other and self and environment is just a side-effect of evolution. If
<br>
you consider the entire possibility space of intelligent organisms,
<br>
there is no reason to consider that you are the same entity from
<br>
moment to moment or distinguish between self and other at all; it's
<br>
just that having that sort of mindset is not conducive to survival of
<br>
the potential replicator.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  just don't think there is any real meaning to &quot;personal identity&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  besides the utility you attach to being able to control future events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The way I look at it, I care about my &quot;future self&quot; (or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  accurately &quot;future selves&quot;) only because we have a lot in common and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  have a lot of influence on him.  Not because I think we are the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  person.  A person to me is defined by a particular sequential history
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of memories.  Every sequence is a different person, even if two such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sequences share a common past.  So the question of whether I will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to &quot;enjoy experiencing the future&quot; is already tautologically false by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  my definition.  I *know* that I won't be around in the future... the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  person who I am now will be very different by then.  Even if I just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  believed in a single timeline, that person would still have a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  new experiences and see the world through different eyes by then, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as I see the world through different eyes than my past selves did.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  strictly speaking, it cannot be said that I will ever have any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  experiences than I've already had.
</em><br>
<p>Strictly speaking, yes; why should I care about some guy that wakes up
<br>
in my bed tomorrow morning and thinks he's me? Why should I care about
<br>
him even if he *does* have a lot in common with me and will tend to
<br>
further my projects? Since I know I won't be around anyway, making
<br>
plans beyond the next second is just evolutions ploy to help propagate
<br>
a certain set of genes. In fact, so is having any sort of goal or
<br>
feeling. But the point is, understanding all this does not make me
<br>
want to reprogram my brain so that I am free of it... since that too
<br>
would be contrary to my programming. I'm a kind of willing slave.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This is something that has always bugged me about a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  immortalists.  It seems like a big motivation for many immortalists is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that they want to &quot;keep on experiencing&quot; things.  But to me, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  silly.  You can't keep on experience things... but you can affect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  future.  I'd like to radically extend my life, but only because I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  certain goals I want accomplished in the future and I don't trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  anyone else besides my &quot;future self&quot; to accomplish them.  Nor do I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  think I can accomplish even a small fraction of them in a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  lifespan.  In my opinion, my reasons for wanting life extension are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rational, whereas a lot of people want life extension for irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reasons (reasons based on the illusion of the self).
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, I know it's silly, but not only am I unable to overcome the
<br>
delusion, the delusion itself stops me from *wanting* to overcome the
<br>
delusion.
