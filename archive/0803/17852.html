<p>
Hi all,
<br>
<p>The AGI-08 conference (agi-08.org) occurred last weekend in Memphis...!
<br>
<p>I had hoped to write up a real scientific summary of AGI-08, but at
<br>
the moment it doesn't look like I'll find the time, so instead I'll
<br>
send out this briefer and more surface-level summary...
<br>
<p>Firstly, the conference went VERY well.  The tone was upbeat, the
<br>
discussions were animated and intelligent, and all in all there was a
<br>
feel of real excitement about having so many AGI people in one place
<br>
at one time.
<br>
<p>Attendance was good: We originally anticipated 80 registrants but had 120+.
<br>
<p>The conference room was a futuristic setting called &quot;The Zone&quot; that
<br>
looked sorta like the Star Trek bridge -- with an excellent if mildly
<br>
glitchy video system that, during Q&amp;A sessions, showed the questioner
<br>
up on a big screen in front of the room.
<br>
<p>The unconventional format (brief talks followed by long
<br>
discussion/Q&amp;A) sessions was both productive and popular.  The whole
<br>
thing was video-ed and at some point the video record will be made
<br>
available online (I don't know the intended timing of this yet).
<br>
<p>The proceedings volume was released by IOS Press a few weeks before
<br>
the conference and is a thick impressive-looking tome.
<br>
<p>The interdisciplinary aspect of the conference seemed to work well --
<br>
e.g. the session on virtual-worlds AI was chaired by Sibley Verbeck
<br>
(CEO of Electric Sheep Company) and the session on neural nets was
<br>
chaired by Randal Koene (a neuroscientist from Boston University).
<br>
This definitely made the discussions deeper than if it had been an
<br>
AI-researchers-only crowd.
<br>
<p>Plenty of folks from government agencies and large and small
<br>
corporations were in attendance, as well as of course many AI
<br>
academics and non-affiliated AGI enthusiasts.  Among the AI academics
<br>
were some highly-respected stalwarts of the AI community, alongside
<br>
the new generation...
<br>
<p>There seemed to be nearly as many Europeans as Americans there, which
<br>
was a pleasant surprise, and some Asians as well.
<br>
<p>The post-conference workshop on ethical, sociocultural and
<br>
futurological issues drew about 60 people and was a bit of a
<br>
free-for-all, with many conflicting perspectives presented quite
<br>
emphatically and vociferously.  I think most of that discussion was
<br>
NOT captured on video (it took place in a different room where
<br>
video-ing was less convenient), though the workshop talks themselves
<br>
were.
<br>
<p>The media folks in attendance seemed most energized by the section on
<br>
AI in virtual worlds, which is because in this section the presenters
<br>
(me, Andrew Shilliday, and Martin Magnusson) showed movies of cute
<br>
animated characters doing stuff.  This gave the nontechnical observers
<br>
something to grab onto, which most of the other talks did not.
<br>
<p>As at the earlier AGI-06 workshop, one of the most obvious
<br>
observations after listening to the talks was that a lot of AGI
<br>
research programs are pursuing fairly similar architectures and ideas
<br>
but using different languages to describe what they're doing.  This
<br>
suggests that making a systematic effort at finding a common language
<br>
and really understanding the true overlaps and differences of the
<br>
various approaches, would be very beneficial.  There was some talk of
<br>
organizing a small, invitation-only workshop among practicing AGI
<br>
system architects, perhaps in Fall 2008, with a view toward making
<br>
progress in this direction.
<br>
<p>Much enthusiasm was expressed for an AGI-09, and it was decided that
<br>
this will likely be located in Washington DC, a location that will
<br>
give us the opportunity to use the conference to help energize various
<br>
government agencies about AGI.
<br>
<p>There was also talk about the possibility of an AGI online technical
<br>
journal, and a group of folks will be following that up, led by Pei
<br>
Wang.
<br>
<p>An &quot;AGI Roadmap&quot; project was also discussed, which would involve
<br>
aligning different cognitive architectures currently proposed insofar
<br>
as possible, but also go beyond that.  Another key aspect of the
<br>
roadmap might be an agreement on certain test environments or tasks
<br>
that could be used to compare and explore various AGI architectures in
<br>
more of a common way than is now possible.
<br>
<p>Lots of ideas ... lots of enthusiasm ... a strong feeling of
<br>
community-building ... so, I'm really grateful to Stan Franklin, Pei
<br>
Wang, Sidney DeMello and Bruce Klein and everyone else who helped to
<br>
organize the conference.
<br>
<p>Finally, an interesting piece of feedback was given by my mother, who
<br>
knows nothing about AGI research (she runs a social service agency)
<br>
and who did not attend the conference but read the media coverage
<br>
afterwards.  What she said is that the media seems to be taking a far
<br>
less skeptical and mocking tone toward AGI these days, as opposed to
<br>
7-10 years ago when I first started appearing in the media now and
<br>
then.  I think this is true, and it signifies a real shift in cultural
<br>
attitude.  This shift is what allowed The Singularity Is Near to sell
<br>
as many copies as it did; and what encouraged so many AI academics to
<br>
come to a mildly out-of-the-mainstream conference on AGI.  Society,
<br>
including the society of scientists, is starting to wake up to the
<br>
notion that, given modern technology and science, human-level AGI is
<br>
no longer a pipe dream but a potential near-term reality.  w00t!  Of
<br>
course there is a long way to go in terms of getting this kind of work
<br>
taken as seriously as it should be, but at least things seem to be
<br>
going in the right direction.
<br>
