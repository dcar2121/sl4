</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please forgive the tone of my reply, but this is how I wish to proceed.
</em><br>
<p>I can't speak for Jeff, but the parodic Stathis fails to even slightly
<br>
offend the real Stathis, making no statements that are inconsistent
<br>
with either logic or the empirical data. Just a few comments:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Jeff:       You know, most astronomers really don't understand that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              there is no clear difference between &quot;star&quot; and &quot;its environment&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;               .... or said another way, that there even *is* such a thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              a star.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Stathis:  Yes, it's actually patently false if you are looking for &quot;objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              truth&quot;. The definition of star, and the phony distinction between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              the star and its environment is a side-effect of our visual system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              and its lack of adequate discriminatory abilities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Jeff:       I know exactly what you mean!  In a more accurate approximation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              to reality, we really have nothing more than &quot;atoms&quot; and sub-atomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              particles, and it really boils down to fundamental quarks, gluons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              and the whole zoo according to the Standard Model, our fabulously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              successful theory of matter and energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Stathis:  Yes, exactly.  We see that there is no clear boundary between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              star and non-star.  It's a continuous rise and lowering of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              density of quarks, gluons, and the rest, as you go from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              center where there is the highest concentration (usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              called the &quot;center of the star&quot;) out towards the layers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              lower density, there is no abrupt ending or boundary anywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              When the solar wind, for example, is included, one can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              say even roughly that a so-called star extends a light year
</em><br>
<em>&gt;              or more in diameter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Jeff:      Precisely.  It's just an illusion, although it does sort of sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             a bit weird or zen-ish to say that there are no such things as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             stars, but the whole concept ultimately has to turn out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             false.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Stathis: It's even clearer that there is no such thing as a star if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             examine the question from yet another direction. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             consider the entire possibility space that this clumping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             of subatomic particles has, there is no reason at all to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             consider that it's even the same clump from moment to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             moment! The entire collection of subatomic particles,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             extending maybe 30,000 AU in each direction from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             the &quot;point&quot; of maximum concentration --- ha! as if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             *were* such a point &lt;visibly exasperated at the fallacies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             of those who speak of a star's &quot;center&quot;&gt; --- isn't at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             the same from instant to instant. The trajectory in phase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             space is in constant motion at all times.
</em><br>
<p>It's not a fallacy to speak of a star's centre, as long as the term
<br>
has some definition that we can all agree on. What is wrong is to
<br>
ascribe special significance to the centre, as if this had some basis
<br>
in physics rather than being a cultural peculiarity. An alien
<br>
civilisation might reference everything to the points where the star's
<br>
axis of rotation cuts a surface where the density is exactly one
<br>
seventh that of water at 56.356 degrees Celcius. They understand what
<br>
you mean by &quot;centre&quot; but are mystified as to why you find it special.
<br>
Are you going to tell them that they're idiots?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;             Of course [continues my parody of Stathis], we understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             how people and astronomers came to this faulty conclusion;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             it's just that having that sort of mindset was conducive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             the survival of the &quot;star-meme&quot;, a reification that enables
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             it to spread easily from &quot;mind&quot; to &quot;mind&quot;, and helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             astronomers gain more information about what's out there.
</em><br>
<p>Not exactly. We know that humans have come to &quot;naturally&quot; delineate a
<br>
star from the surrounding space and matter because of the way their
<br>
minds and sense organs have evolved to detect electromagnetic
<br>
radiation, for example. Aliens might consider the whole galaxy as
<br>
close to a homogeneous whole, with variations in temperature and
<br>
clumpiness only of interest to a scientist or a pedant. How would you
<br>
explain to these aliens that they've got it wrong? Where is their
<br>
empirical or logical error.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Returning to the actual Stathis, who, after all, as I quoted above
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  really did write
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; If you consider the entire possibility space of intelligent organisms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; there is no reason to consider that you are the same entity from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; moment to moment or distinguish between self and other at all;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well, one wonders based on this if he's some sort of nominalist (as opposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to realists who---most of us---do reify rather often).
</em><br>
<p>By the definition in the Wikipedia article
<br>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism</a>), I'm a nominalist rather
<br>
than a realist. However, I am a mathematical Platonist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Stathis---the real one, again---agrees:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Strictly speaking, yes; why should I care about some guy that wakes up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; in my bed tomorrow morning and thinks he's me? Why should I care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; him even if he *does* have a lot in common with me and will tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; further my projects? Since I know I won't be around anyway, making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plans beyond the next second is just evolution's ploy to help propagate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a certain set of genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Well, as soon as you are uploaded, you can take care of that, Stathis!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You can reprogram yourself so that you won't make plans for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  future, so long, say, as you can contribute money or something to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  see to it that your projects continue to be worked on. Oh, you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;want&quot; to?  (Actually, I wonder &quot;who&quot; this &quot;you&quot; is who's saying this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  right now.) But please see below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; In fact, so is having any sort of goal or feeling. But the point is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; understanding all this does not make me want to reprogram my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; brain so that I am free of it... since that too would be contrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to my programming. I'm a kind of willing slave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Don't give up so easily!  You can free yourself from your slavery!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Just give the AI who awakens you from cryonic suspension,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or who oversees your uploading, explicit instructions to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  those changes that you won't have the will power to do yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Do you want to be a &quot;willing slave&quot; forever?  Besides, there must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be other words for slaves who want to remain slaves.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't want to die, and because I don't want to die, I don't want to
<br>
do anything that will make me suicidal, such as modifying my own mind
<br>
or allowing someone else to do it. I know beyond any doubt that this
<br>
desire to live (which incorporates beliefs about personal identity and
<br>
what counts as survival) is just something that evolution has
<br>
programmed into me, and that there is no objective basis to it. If a
<br>
person claims that 2+2=5 he is wrong, and if a person claims that lead
<br>
is denser than gold he is wrong; but if a person declares that he no
<br>
longer wishes to live he is *not* wrong, but simply stating a
<br>
predilection which happens to be contrary to the usual evolutionary
<br>
programming. But understanding all this as I do, I *still* would
<br>
resist anything that would make me suicidal. Moreover, I don't in the
<br>
slightest regret the fact that I am trapped in this way. This is what
<br>
I mean by &quot;willing slave&quot;.
