<p>
<em>&gt; Humans and AIs have radically different cognitive structures. Trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to implement Friendliness on both at the same time isn't going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work.
</em><br>
<p>OK.  I agree with the first sentence and strongly disagree with the second. 
<br>
What basis do you have for believing the second?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My initial thought was that you had actually written out a technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specification and tested it on working software.
</em><br>
<p>There is no software sophisticated enough to test Friendliness at this time. 
<br>
I am sorry for confusing you.  It was *not* intentional.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm afraid of this list being infected with impossible Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architectures.
</em><br>
<p>If it's impossible then you shouldn't be afraid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since none of us have any idea who you are or where you live, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be rather difficult.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all correct.  There are a decent number of people on this list who 
<br>
have met me in person at either the AGIRI Workshop in Maryland in May of 
<br>
2006 or the AGI08 Conference held earlier this month in Memphis.  If you 
<br>
Google my name, the top entry tells you where I work.  If you add my state 
<br>
(obvious from my workplace) to my name, the top nine entries are mine and 
<br>
can tell you what my last job was, where I go to church, two of the last 
<br>
races that I ran in, etc., etc.  Are all your statements this bad?  The 
<br>
Bayesian probability of your statement about implementing Friendliness on 
<br>
both not going to work just took a drop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of Christianity's main principles is that everyone acts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unethically all the time. This isn't quite true, but it's plausible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, given most people's understanding of human cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; architecture. What makes you different from everyone else?
</em><br>
<p>No, that principle says that everyone is imperfect and makes mistakes.  I am 
<br>
no different from everyone else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you're intelligent enough to rewrite human architecture to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent, without the benefit of ultratechnology, you should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent enough to figure out how to provide evidence for it.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  You can't figure out a decent proof either.  Why not be honest and 
<br>
admit it rather than launching another attack when all I did was ask for a 
<br>
suggestion?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  What cooperative Friendliness?  I'm not seeing any cooperation here at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; all.  I asked for assistance.  I said &quot;If you believe that this is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; incorrect, *PLEASE* free me by showing me where this meme is harmful and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rid me of my infection.&quot;  You came back and attacked me for being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; misleading and then demanded proof that I was a good person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It only becomes cooperative when it spreads to a large group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, which (if I understand correctly) is what you're assuming.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not trying to promote cooperative Friendliness.  This is a side-track.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Prove your statement by freeing me of the meme or making me willingly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perform an unethical act.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have to. If I'm powerful enough, I can simply *shoot you*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Poof, there goes Friendliness.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  You can kill my Friendliness by killing me.  Is that your solution to 
<br>
the Friendly AI problem as well?  I don't believe that it's going to work.
