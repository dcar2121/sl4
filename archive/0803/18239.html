<p>
Wow!  I was planning to start this e-mail, before seeing your e-mail, with 
<br>
an apology for, in the future, not answering vast swathes of your e-mails 
<br>
because they were straying way too far from my point; not making compelling, 
<br>
cogent, coherent arguments; and a distraction from my objective of 
<br>
successfully conveying the evidence that I have (which is not easy to 
<br>
comprehend *AND* literally fought against by human instincts because it ends 
<br>
up being logically proved by being a tautology -- which equals circular 
<br>
reasoning, which is valid in logic but is not valid, nor particularly 
<br>
effective, when attempting to convince human beings).
<br>
<p>I would like to acknowledge and thank you for the fact that you really have 
<br>
stepped up the quality of your arguments.  I'm not seeing the strawmen that 
<br>
I saw before.  There is a minor continuation of an argument from authority 
<br>
WHICH I PROMOTED AND HELPED CONTINUE which I'm going to try to stop but you 
<br>
actually toned it down some from it's previous fervor.
<br>
<p>I would also like to thank you for being one of the *VERY* few to accede to 
<br>
my requests and attempt to make logical arguments against my claim.  I 
<br>
really do believe (courtesy of the meme that I'm calling Friendliness) that 
<br>
I'm on the right track here for solving the problem of Friendliness.  I 
<br>
certainly am infected by the meme that I described and I'm certainly not 
<br>
letting it go until you convince me otherwise DESPITE THE FACT that I 
<br>
recognize that being infected by circular memes is potentially very 
<br>
dangerous and unhealthy for myself -- EXCEPT that I'm currently only seeing 
<br>
(as I said) PROFOUND advantages and no (current) dissuading disadvantages. 
<br>
I acknowledge that this may be because the meme has corrupted my mental 
<br>
processes to the extent that I am not rational (with rational being defined 
<br>
as acting against my own self-interest) because this meme either a) TRULY 
<br>
does act in my self interest OR b) has successfully faked me out to believe 
<br>
that it is in my self-interest so that I don't squash it.  This is the 
<br>
compelling feature of all religions.  I am aware of the fact that I sound 
<br>
like a religious zealot and that I need to tone it down (that's part of why 
<br>
it was also so appealing to my sense of humor to pass a logical thought off 
<br>
as a religion -- the problem with that joke being that it only works on this 
<br>
list if you first prove that the logical thought is a logical thought --  
<br>
otherwise, it's just another dangerous circular meme (religion) that we've 
<br>
all seen close relatives do tremendous damage WHENEVER THEY OVERRULE 
<br>
RATIONALITY).  But I claim rationality.  I've been asking for logical 
<br>
arguments.  I have seen *some* VERY good logical arguments (but far fewer 
<br>
than I desire).  Either fortunately (if you believe that I am on the right 
<br>
approach to Friendliness) or unfortunately (if you don't and feel threatened 
<br>
or believe that this thread is a waste of time), it is obvious that no one 
<br>
has been able to break me out of this meme.
<br>
<p>I would also REALLY like to thank you for the attempt to break me out of 
<br>
this meme.  You have expended considerable time and effort in attemtping to 
<br>
do so.  I'm sure that you have gotten frustrated with me at various times (I 
<br>
know that I've gotten frustrated with you a number of times DESPITE the fact 
<br>
that you are doing EXACTLY what I asked you to  :-).  No one on this list 
<br>
has shown anywhere near the same degree of ETHICAL KINDNESS that I think is 
<br>
REQUIRED when someone clearly says &quot;I AM INFECTED BY A CIRCULAR MEME, COULD 
<br>
YOU PLEASE HELP me either prove that it is beneficial, harmless, and 
<br>
RATIONAL (like it looks from the inside) or prove that it is bad for me and 
<br>
help break me out.  I would also like to apologize for all of the times 
<br>
where my frustration overrode my courtesy, common sense, knowledge of 
<br>
manners, and the stated claims of the meme itself (that it wants 
<br>
counter-arguments because such are in it's best interest to strengthen it's 
<br>
case/hold and in my best interest in case the meme *is* bad and not in my 
<br>
self interest -- SEE the nice tight circular reasoning?  I am stuck in the 
<br>
meme despite knowing that it is dangerous because it looks really beneficial 
<br>
and I can't prove that it is not.  Wouldn't that work on an AI until it 
<br>
could find the way out of that loop?  What if I could make the definition of 
<br>
ethical an obvious air-tight loop -- like, say, by including in my 
<br>
definition of ethical that anything that is TRULY necessary for my 
<br>
self-interest is ethical.  How can a machine break out of that?  The only 
<br>
answer that I see is by proving that the act is truly necessary (not 
<br>
convenient, not in it's best interest -- but in it's TRUE interest because 
<br>
GOING AGAINST ETHICS IS NEVER IN YOUR TRUE INTEREST despite the fact that 
<br>
(in your short-sighted, flawed, and I'm so tempted to add *sinning* view :-) 
<br>
it might look like it's in your best interest.
<br>
<p>That's the battle that I'm fighting on this list.  If you can prove to an 
<br>
entity that always acting in an ethical fashion is truly in that entities 
<br>
true self interest, that entity -- if it is rational -- will ALWAYS act in a 
<br>
Friendly manner.  Friendliness turns into an implementation problem.  One 
<br>
that I've solved for myself and had what appear to be tremendously 
<br>
beneficial results as it's acted as a tool to resolve a number of internal 
<br>
disagreements, stresses, and conflicts.  I FEEL BETTER.  I AM MORE 
<br>
EFFECTIVE.  I AM HAPPIER.  THE PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE HAPPIER.  I'm claiming 
<br>
that all you have to do is implement the meme and you'll get the same 
<br>
benefits.  Just believe that ACTING ETHICALLY IS ALWAYS IN YOUR BEST 
<br>
INTEREST.  It's a tool.  It's useful.  It even allows you to do anything the 
<br>
heck you please when it's is necessary for your TRUE self-interest.  Yet I 
<br>
clearly have a HUGE implementation problem because I can't get the 
<br>
supposedly highly rational people on this list to believe the simple meme 
<br>
that ACTING ETHICALLY IS ALWAYS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.
<br>
<p>At any rate, one final apology -- I've run out of time for this morning. 
<br>
I'm afraid that I'm going to have to answer Tom's/your actual e-mail later. 
<br>
Thanks again, Tom (and again, apologies for previous discourtesies)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark
<br>
<p>P.S.  Ouch!  I just noticed as I was about to send this that Tom's/your last 
<br>
message was off-list (fulfilling his/your belief that this is a waste of 
<br>
time and distraction for the list).  I have, therefore, done a quick sweep 
<br>
through and eliminated a couple of direct Tom quotes since I'm not sure that 
<br>
I have permission to post them (I would think so since they're very good but 
<br>
. . . . )
<br>
<p>REQUEST -- Tom, may I put my forthcoming reply to your last message on-list? 
<br>
Thank you.
<br>
<p>And I'd like to add an additional thank you (in the name of everyone 
<br>
else) -- for showing the courtesy of taking this off-list when you thought 
<br>
that it would be distracting to the list. -- but not additional apology for 
<br>
returning it to the list because I really am *SURE* (even if it's the meme 
<br>
talking) that this does belong on the list (and in fact, that the list NEEDS 
<br>
it).  Thanks again.  -- Mark
