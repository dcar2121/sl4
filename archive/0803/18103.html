</em><br>
<p>Yes, and this is where my crude chemical analogy falls to the ground.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You have also said, I think, that if a knowledgeable

<em>&gt; computation know whether he is knowledgeable or ignorant if he keeps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to himself?
</em><br>
<p>The computation doesn't know. What I am claiming is that there
<br>
exists an ontological fact concerning whether or not the computation
<br>
was conscious *at* that very step. (See more below.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The 6*7 = 42 computation is carried out in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Australia by someone with a pocket calculator. The M2/M3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is carried out by the calculator reaching all but the last step
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of the calculation, when the machine is destroyed but a nimble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  operator manages to record the semifinal state on a diskette and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  sends it to Vienna [where a] a child in Vienna receives this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  diskette, transfers the state to his own calculator, and finishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  it, getting the answer 42.  But on some cases the operator sends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a faulty semifinal diskette, and then either by luck the answer 42
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is obtained, or else, say, 58 is obtained. You direct our attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to the case where by luck 42 is obtained anyway, despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;noisy channel&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Either actual information flows, or it doesn't, i.e., the channel is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  noisy or it's not. The ignorant person trying out &quot;every possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  state&quot; means what? Maybe the child in Vienna tries out a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  ensemble of diskettes one by one, and every so often one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  them happens by sheer chance to be identical to the proper
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; diskette produced  in Australia?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes: under what circumstances do you think the computation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented? For example, if the child in Vienna gets two diskettes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowing that one of them is the correct one, and tries [out both],
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does that mean the computation will definitely be implemented on one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, please, please forgive me. You're right.  Damn, here we are
<br>
talking (my fault) about taking a particular *state* and moving 
<br>
it somewhere.  I agree---and always have---that it does not
<br>
matter where the state came from.  I was confused.  I mean,
<br>
I've always been a fan of Max More's &quot;Luckiest Man in the
<br>
Universe Scenario&quot; wherein an accidental combination of
<br>
20th century molecules comes together by sheer chance and
<br>
is a close duplicate (or an exact copy of a particular state)
<br>
of Francis Bacon.  I was a fan, because it so well fit the ideas
<br>
I'd had ever since 1966.  That &quot;copy&quot;, if you will, really is Sir
<br>
Francis, just as if he'd stepped out of a teleporter booth.
<br>
<p>What I *am* talking about is the causality *between* the states.
<br>
That is, to revert to your Monday/Tuesday experiment, which
<br>
implements Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;Sc-&gt;...-&gt;Sj on Monday and some other
<br>
computer (if you will) implements Sm-&gt;Sn-&gt;...-&gt;Sz on Tuesday.
<br>
(Or last month, it doesn't really matter.)
<br>
<p>Sj is not the same state as Sm, and I got to talking about
<br>
them as if they were the same state.  Sorry.
<br>
<p>I mean to say that the entire run (on some yet entirely different
<br>
computer) that goes Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;Sc-&gt;...-&gt;Sm-&gt;Sn-&gt;...-&gt;Sz,
<br>
(where it is important to stipulate that Sm follows Sj causally
<br>
even though a few letters of the alphabet have been left out),
<br>
will or will not be exactly the same thing depending on how
<br>
the Sm state really arose.  If it arose by chance---i.e. no
<br>
causal connection, no information flow from Sj---then there
<br>
is an iota of consciousness missing from any Monday/Tuesday
<br>
run that suffered this tiny causal interruption.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  You could easily have an ordinary 3D sculpture totally isomorphic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to a 2D run through time.  I used to suggest to people that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  visualize a stack of very thin gels, each recording the state of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Life Board. Piled on top of each other, they depict with 100%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  fidelity a Life Board computation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but how can you be sure that the pile of Life Boards doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implement consciousness given that the corresponding time-varying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Life Board does?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure!  I have not been sure since 1981. (Actually for a couple
<br>
of years after 1988 I thought that the problem was simply solved by
<br>
demanding &quot;information flow&quot;.  I still stick with that you see, but am
<br>
almost as troubled by all this as I was from 1981-1988.)  I am forced
<br>
to my position by being unable to think of any alternative that I find
<br>
satisfactory:
<br>
<p>Take me to that sculpture (which is timeless), or that stack of Life
<br>
Board gels, and I simply recoil from the idea that the thing is
<br>
conscious (or was conscious at any point in time). Naturally,
<br>
destroying it doesn't matter, since it's timeless anyway.
<br>
It's a &quot;done deal&quot;.  But by the reductio that you read about in
<br>
my &quot;The Problem of the Succession of Frozen States&quot; essay,
<br>
the &quot;stack of gels&quot; that is saliently apparent to the universe,
<br>
if you will forgive a wild figure of speech, could be distributed
<br>
all over.  Even in the sparse clouds of dust between the galactic
<br>
clusters.
<br>
<p>And---needless to say---we are right back to where we
<br>
were.  Though, (for me at least) with yet additional clarity
<br>
and understanding, thanks to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Touche.  All right, then suppose I have a choice between (a) somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  magically removing from the universe---and causing to entirely cease to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  exist---a 400 kilogram of Stathis, or blowing your present biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  incarnation to smithereens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, this will no doubt make it seem even more absurd to you but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removing the rock from the universe won't make any difference either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is because if an amount of matter can map onto any computation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then a smaller amount of matter can map onto the same computation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple parallel processes.
</em><br>
<p>Then why would it matter if your biological instance were removed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the ultimate extrapolation of this idea a simulation of the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe maps onto the null state. This would mean that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate physical reality, but what we think of as physical reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a simulation on the big Universal Machine in Platonia. Thus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical reality is put on the same ontological basis as the natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know. Like Tegmark's Level Four.  Like Greg Egan's &quot;Theory
<br>
of Dust&quot; which, by the way, I had to infer from an interview he gave
<br>
that he does by no means entirely endorse that view (or any particular
<br>
view he so cleverly and superbly explicates in his novels).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No need for God, or for asking why there is something rather than nothing.
</em><br>
<p>I have no need of those in my hypotheses.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Well, I'm sure you don't weigh 400kg, so let's say that you weigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  100kg. In comparison to the biological 100kg Stathis, how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;computation of Stathis&quot;, if I may ask, does a 100kg marble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  statue of you emulate?  Or, in other words, right now your 100kg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  because it's ordinary matter at about 295 degrees Kelvin, already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  emulates you to some degree.  What degree?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There isn't a separate physical me. The physical me is a simulation,
</em><br>
<p>I do prefer &quot;emulation&quot; in this context since a very good actor 
<br>
or a superhuman AI puppet master could just be pulling your
<br>
strings, and there isn't any real feeling and thinking Stathis at all,
<br>
but only some inhuman God-like creature having a bit of fun.
<br>
Or a skillful enough actor, I suppose, who somehow does an
<br>
incredibly good Stathis impersonation, while the real Stathis
<br>
was executed in December.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and blowing up the physical me means the computations in Platonia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underpinning me come to an end; whereas blowing up a statue of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not affect the computations relating to my consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite understand this point. Aren't you being emulated by rocks,
<br>
or maybe large rocks also?  Aren't you being emulated by some of the
<br>
patches of dust between the galaxies?  Since you're being emulated in
<br>
so many many places (assume for a moment our Level One universe
<br>
is infinite like Tegmark says), surely the demise of a little bit of matter
<br>
in Australia (whether it's removed altogether from the universe, or
<br>
raised to 451 degrees Fahrenheit) can't make a difference, can it?
