</em><br>
<p>Consider a robot whose entire mental state is 2 counters: n_heads and n_tails,
<br>
both initialized to 0.  The only observation that the robot can make is that
<br>
of a coin flip, in which case one of the two counters is incremented depending
<br>
on the outcome.  The robot's output is a prediction p(heads) =
<br>
(n_heads+1)/(n_heads+n_tails+2), i.e. Laplace's derivation of the maximum
<br>
entropy prediction of the next coin flip assuming an a-priori bias uniformly
<br>
distributed between 0 and 1.
<br>
<p>1. A robot flips a coin with unknown bias 100 times and counts 99 heads.  What
<br>
is its prediction p(heads) of the next coin flip?
<br>
<p>2. A robot flips a coin with unknown bias 100 times.  If it is heads, it and
<br>
the coin are copied 100 times.  All coins are actually fair (p(heads) = 0.5). 
<br>
What is its expected estimate of p(heads) of the next flip for a robot
<br>
randomly chosen from the resulting ~ 50^100 robots?
<br>
<p>3. 50^100 robots start with 1 coin each with unknown bias (but actually fair).
<br>
&nbsp;Whenever a coin comes up tails the robot is killed with probability 0.99. 
<br>
After 100 flips, only one robot remains.  What is its expected estimate of
<br>
p(heads)?
<br>
<p>4. Start with 50^100 robots.  Divide them into groups of 100 robots with 1
<br>
coin each.  Flip the coin.  If it comes up tails, then hold a lottery and kill
<br>
99 of the robots in that group.  Repeat 100 times, after which one robot is
<br>
left.  What is its expected estimate of p(heads)?
<br>
<p>5. One robot flips a coin with unknown bias (but actually fair) until n_heads
<br>
+ n_tails = 100.  Whenever a coin comes up tails, both counters are reset to 0
<br>
with probability 0.99.  What is its expected estimate of p(heads) when
<br>
finished (about 50^100 coin flips later)?
<br>
<p>Is it possible for a robot to distinguish between these 5 cases?  What about a
<br>
human?
