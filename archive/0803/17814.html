<p><em>&gt; What is the lowest level level of complexity in life forms that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would assign consciousness and self-awareness? Mice? Ants?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mussels maybe?
</em><br>
<p>Clearly it has to be a continuum. Therefore, it's probably wrong
<br>
to look for a dividing line in a careful philsophic discusions such
<br>
as this.
<br>
<p>I claim that we know that undamaged humans are relatively highly
<br>
conscious when awake. Animal experiments seem to show that
<br>
bonobos, chimpanzees, dogs, dolphins, pigs, octopi, and a number
<br>
of others clearly exhibit the signs of having a good deal of consciousness.
<br>
<p>And so it goes down the animal scale. As an aside, for people, a
<br>
signficant part of consciousness is the ability to direct internal
<br>
information to the verbal centers where they are retained in novel
<br>
linguistic ways, ways that only a few highly trained animals are
<br>
achieving (at, say, the level of a four year old child).
<br>
<p>The higher animals and ourselves have consciousness because it
<br>
has proved to be of survival value. Since trees can't act (at least
<br>
beyond rather rudimentary ways of responding chemically when
<br>
under attack by certain insects or diseases), then there has been
<br>
and is very little need for trees to be involved in a lot of decision
<br>
making, and so consciousness would be of very little use to them.
<br>
<p>It seems highly plausible that mice, rabbits, and birds are also
<br>
conscious in the way that we should use the term.  Crows, and
<br>
especially the wonderfully trained and famous Alex the parrot,
<br>
often achieve notable signs of high consciousness.
<br>
<p>Honey bees, surprisingly, seem to exhibit much greater decision
<br>
making capabilities than would have been guessed, but my own
<br>
guess is that consciousness among any insects is pretty miniscule.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also obviously impossible to answer objectively, but one has to try.....
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  And later, with more research, our answers will get better
<br>
and better.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's a practical question for me as it relates directly to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian but obviously has theoretical implications. Though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will still choose not to eat meat as an exercise in compassion
</em><br>
<p>Oh?  If you do that, fewer cows and other meat bearing animals
<br>
will be bred and get to live.  So long as their lives come suddenly
<br>
and as painlessly as possible to an end, any true animal advocate
<br>
should be in favor of human eating them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would like to hear some more educated views on the matter.
</em><br>
<p>Me too.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My (uneducated) view on the matter is that it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising if most insects were conscious because of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple brains and their great reliance on chemical signals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the blood flow for simple communication of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the body. The same might hold for some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smaller mammals. And I would say “no” for the mussels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but wouldn't I love to be surprised...... :)

<p>Oh yes, we do. I suggest the books &quot;Kanzi: The Ape at the Brink of the
<br>
Human Mind&quot;, or parts of &quot;The First Word&quot; (by Christine Kenneally),
<br>
just two that spring to mind of many.
<br>
<p>And there are many other books and essays that make extremely reasonable
<br>
to surmise that animals are conscious to one degree or another, on any normal
<br>
or usual meaning of the term.  We ought not to suppose that on one fine day
<br>
a hundred thousand years ago consciousness just suddenly appeared.
<br>
<p>Also, it's very clear that Helen Keller was conscious while entirely deaf,
<br>
blind, and dumb, and before finding a teacher who communicated with her
<br>
via touch.
<br>
<p><p><p>Agreed. The estimate was to be conservative.
<br>
<p>Not to mention the fact that attributing a 'soul' or the modern equivalent to humans and not animals is largely a judaeo-christian 
<br>
tendency and traceable largely to that tradition.
