</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Right.  As regards *anticipation*, not yet.  I should dig up my old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  essay &quot;The Anticipation Paradox&quot; and post it.  The bottom line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is that there are TEs in which you have to look forward (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;anticipate&quot;) something that already happened to you.(!)
</em><br>
<p>Anticipating something that already happened to you is definitely not
<br>
possible with my definition of anticipate.  I think your problem may
<br>
be that you're using a poor definition of anticipate.  The purpose of
<br>
anticipation is to prepare a current brain state to be able to respond
<br>
appropriately for some future change in that brain state (when it is
<br>
exposed to a new event and hence modified to become a new brain
<br>
state).  The chain of cause and effect only goes from past to future.
<br>
With only a single branch, every current brain state can affect future
<br>
brain states but not past brain states.  With mutliple branches (as in
<br>
the Many Worlds Interpretation, which I consider to be the best
<br>
current scientific model of the world) each brain state in the present
<br>
becomes multiple brain states in the future.  But there is still
<br>
always a chain of cause and effect, but the arrows of causality form a
<br>
tree rather than a single line.  Unless there is some kind of time
<br>
travel possible, you can never affect things in the past and therefore
<br>
there is no reason to anticipate anything in the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Note how totally and completely different (and impossible so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as I know) for memory merging to plausibly take place between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  two actually different people.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand what you mean by &quot;actually different&quot;, since in the
<br>
example you gave, you're merging two &quot;actually different&quot; people.
<br>
There's no such thing as two identical people, unless you're talking
<br>
about right at the single moment you copy someone.  One millisecond
<br>
afterwards they are already two different people, with a different set
<br>
of memories and behavior.  In your example, they would be very
<br>
different by the time they were merged again and probably completely
<br>
unmergable.  Memory in humans is not stored at a single memory address
<br>
like it is in a desktop computer.  When you're exposed to new
<br>
experiences, it recongifgures whole clusters of neurons and the
<br>
structure of your brain and the interconnections between lots of
<br>
different things change.  It's highly sensitive to the order in which
<br>
you experience things, as new events will change the way you
<br>
understand past events, and sometimes even create false memories.
<br>
While I have no proof that it's impossible, I have a very hard time
<br>
imagining any plausible way you could accomplish such a merge.  Maybe
<br>
you could do a very &quot;dirty merge&quot;, but there would be a lot of
<br>
ambiguity and choices to be made about all of the conflicting neural
<br>
modifications that are present in both of the copies... it seems
<br>
guaranteed to cause massive psychological problems, even if the person
<br>
was similar enough that they had only been split for an hour or less.
