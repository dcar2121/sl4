Recap for those who're reading this afresh.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State-j is the last state of Monday, and State-m is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first state of Tuesday, where Monday is a 24hr computer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emulation of a person and Tuesday is the 24hr continuation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that person. We expect it to be subjectively identical to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the emulatee to a 48hr run of the same program.:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is at issue is how different is this situation from a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48 hour computer run that begins at a state Sa and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceeds all the way to the end of Tuesday, state Sz,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if we mess in interesting ways with the last state of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday and the first statet of Tuesday.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sj is the last state of Monday and the first state of Tuesday
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is Sm (Stathis probably very farsightedly left some letters
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between those two states &quot;just in case&quot;.  The computations inside
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Monday computer go from Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;...-&gt;Sj  and are a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfect simulation. Likewise the computations inside the Tuesday
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer go Sm-&gt;Sn-&gt;...-&gt;Sz.  (Sorry for a typo in my previous
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;post, where I erroneously referred to a Sk = State-k.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinarily on a normal computer Sj would give rise to Sm by the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laws of physics or their in-computer equivalent, but we're 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exploring slightly different variations on how (or whether) Sm
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually starts first thing Tuesday, or whether Sj is copied from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the end of Monday and planted on the Tuesday computer as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one little precursor to get things rolling just like the 48 hr run.
<br>
<p>Stathis writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I had in mind was that Sj is used as input to produce its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successor Sm, from which the rest of Tuesday follows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterministically. If Sj is reliably transferred from the first to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second computer that would be the same as if the computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfolded in the one intact machine, no?
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if the transfer were unreliable it would only be by chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the &quot;right&quot; sequence of states was set into motion giving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise to the Tuesday experience.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  To me, that's as if we perfectly emulate a person's 48hr
<br>
life quite a few times without incident. Then in some run of that
<br>
single computer a God-particle level cosmic ray strikes at
<br>
midnight on Monday, and the rest of the computation takes
<br>
off in an entirely random and different direction, probably no
<br>
longer emulating the same person at all
<br>
<p>To you, is that equivalent also?
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  What is the appeal to you and Schmidhuber and the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the gang to all that dust comprising 0.99999999999 of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  experience?  That would seem to me to induce fatalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Determinism, yes. Is that the same as fatalism?
</em><br>
<p>No, I mean something like this:  Suppose that I hear that an
<br>
extremely large asteroid by sheer luck is barreling down on
<br>
the Earth at thousands of kilometers per second. I see this
<br>
as a big, big hit on my runtime. (We're all going to die.)
<br>
Why, in the Tegmark example, there is no other Lee Corbin
<br>
for about 10^10^29 lightyears from here. So for me personally,
<br>
not to mention all the people I love, this (to me) is very bad
<br>
news. 
<br>
<p>How is it for you?   If 0.99999999999 of you (say in the 
<br>
visible universe 10^42 ly across), is unaffected by the asteroid,
<br>
why worry?
