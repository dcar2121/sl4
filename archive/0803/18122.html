<em>&gt;&gt; Let's focus on this because this is where you are assuming what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm asking you to explain. Why is it important to be *like*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; something? As before, concept of  &quot;survival&quot; cannot be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the explanation.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I haven't answered your last question. I sort of have to throw up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my hands. I cannot explain why you don't want to be like certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deformed people who have two heads, and I can't explain why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't want to be &quot;like&quot; a rodent. We have to start somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slawek.
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that preserving &quot;likeness&quot; is important because creatures that are 
<br>
not like you experience lower quality of life?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There *are* other things I can be attached to, you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Like what?
</em><br>
<p>*This* instance of mind process responsible for perception and making sense of the 
<br>
world around me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what does that tell you about importance of runtime vs. memories? You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could have had all your memories intact forever and yet you didn't choose this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; option. Interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As heaven is my witness, I have never in the last 40 years dismissed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what today I call runtime or processing!  As you say, the memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without any possibility whatsoever in all the future history of the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting runtime are totally worthless to me.  I have said that again and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, I'm pretty sure.
</em><br>
<p>Good, so can I infer from this that having runtime is also at least as important to 
<br>
you as maintaining the same memories?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Oh, you are referring to Reagan's amnesia. People close to him said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he had died bit by bit in the preceding months or years. Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes perfect sense, given what we know.  What was being celebrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was his whole life and his whole record, as you know. His deanimation was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a convenient and very traditional point at which to &quot;celebrate&quot; his passing.
</em><br>
<p>If on June 4th 2004 you asked anyone in the world whether Reagan was still alive,
<br>
almost everyone would reply &quot;yes.&quot;  I'm not trying to argue that your definition of
<br>
death is wrong because of this. I'm only trying to point out that your definition
<br>
of death (where death=amnesia) is quite exotic to most people. I doubt Reagan's
<br>
friends and family thought he was actually dead on June 4th 2004. I bet they 
<br>
thought he was very
<br>
sick, and couldn't remember much, but not dead.
<br>
