</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it's an obvious point. But the idea that any computation can be

</em><br>
<p>Well, that's hardly any way to deal with my &quot;obvious point&quot;.
<br>
&lt;Insert humorous analogy here about following a &quot;ridiculous&quot;
<br>
assumption to its thereby ridiculous consequences.&gt;  :-)
<br>
Of course, as I said, so many luminaries join you in believing
<br>
that a timeless object (a frozen state) can implement computation,
<br>
implement, consciousness, and implement information flow, that
<br>
of course I'm not really saying &quot;ridiculous&quot;. How about just
<br>
&quot;suspicious&quot;?  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From this it follows that every computation is implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessarily by virtue of its status as a Platonic object....
</em><br>
<p>I inquired
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; [Stathis wrote] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; and (b) that it doesn't result in information flow between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; the states. But I don't think it's obviously absurd, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; see the lack of information flow (or inability to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; counterfactuals) as just making it impossible for us as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; external observers to use the system for computation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Could you explain a bit more to me about this?  Between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  perhaps not using &quot;counter-factual&quot; correctly, or whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  it makes a fig of difference about &quot;external observers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (it doesn't), I'm not sure I'm following you.  Perhaps an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  example distinct from the Monday/Tuesday one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  help me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with you to an extent about the significance of causality in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation. Suppose there are steps in a computation which don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow from the preceding step, but just happen to occur correctly *as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if* they followed from the preceding step.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, well put. It does seem a tad suspicious to refer to that
<br>
as computation.  But I do note you just said &quot;I agree with you
<br>
to an extent...&quot;   :-)   Somehow, I don't think that this is going
<br>
to degenerate to a flame war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, imagine a machine M1 into which you input &quot;6*7&quot;, gears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and levers and so forth go clickety-clack, and after 100 steps it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outputs &quot;42&quot;. Next, consider another identical machine, M2, into which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you input &quot;6*7&quot;, but at the 73rd step you destroy it. The next day on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other side of the world, by fantastic coincidence, someone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; builds a machine, M3, which just happens to be in identical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; configuration to M1 (and hence M2, had it not been destroyed) at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 73rd step. M3 then goes clickety-clack through steps 74 to 100 and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outputs &quot;42&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would agree with you that even though the activity of M2/M3 seen in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combination might look the same as the activity of M1, they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent computational systems. This is because M1 would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriately handle a counterfactual, but M2/M3 would not: if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input to M1 had been &quot;4*5&quot; the output would have been &quot;20&quot;, whereas if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the input to M2 had been &quot;4*5&quot; the output from M3 would have still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been &quot;42&quot;, as the lack of a causal link between M2 and M3 means there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no way for the input of M2 to influence the output of M3.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the clarification on the usage of terms. I guess I'm
<br>
thinking of &quot;counter-factual&quot; okay in our context here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The obvious significance of this is that M2/M3 is useless as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational device. It could be made useful by introducing reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information transfer between the two machines, say by an operator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passing M2's final state to be used as M3's initial state. The new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M2/M3 system is then equivalent to the intact M1, albeit a bit slower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and more cumbersome.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, let's suppose that implementation of the computation 6*7 = 42
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is associated with a primitive moment of consciousness, and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simplicity that this is the case only if the computation is implemented in full.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We would then both agree that M1 and M2/M3 with reliable information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfer would give rise to consciousness. You would argue that M2/M3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without reliable information transfer would not give rise to consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I would so argue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what if the information transfer doesn't fall into the all or none category?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, what if the operator transfers the right information some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time based on whim, but never reveals to anyone what he decides? The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M2/M3 system (plus operator) would again be useless as a computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; device to an external observer, but on some runs, known only to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operator, there will definitely be a causal link.
</em><br>
<p>Very clear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does consciousness occur on those runs or not?
</em><br>
<p>I would say consciousness occurs only on those runs where, yes,
<br>
true causality obtained.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does it make a difference if the operator lies 99.999% of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time or 0.001% of the time? Does the computation know when he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lying, or does it know the proportion of time he intends to lie so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it can experience fractional consciousness at the appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level?
</em><br>
<p>My conjecture is that when the operator lies 99.999% of the
<br>
time, then consciousness is actually not present that fraction 
<br>
of the time, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You will have a hard time defining criteria (let alone a mechanism)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereby a computation &quot;knows&quot; that there is a causal link.
</em><br>
<p>I would suggest that a computation merely *is*, and doesn't need
<br>
to know anything. But I realize I'm being unfair by putting it so
<br>
harshly. In fact, I would put it the other way around: if there is
<br>
a causal link, then there can be consciousness, but only if.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is simpler to assume that consciousness occurs purely as a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the right physical states being implemented, while the presence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a recognisable causal link only determines whether the system can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used by an external observer for useful computation.
</em><br>
<p>It may (or may not) be simpler, as you suggest, to suppose that all
<br>
that is necessary is that the right physical states occur or are 
<br>
implemented somehow.  I doubt very much that there is a logical
<br>
flaw in your suggestion.  On the other hand, I doubt that there is
<br>
any insoluble problem with mine---just a bit of awkwardness,
<br>
e.g., why is a 3+1 dimensional creature conscious, a 2+1 dimensional
<br>
creature conscious (as in Flatland or the Life Board), but a 3 dimensional
<br>
frozen block that is *completely* isomorphic to the 2+1 structure
<br>
not conscious?  Basically, I just have to hem and haw, and assert
<br>
even more forcibly that I am a time-chauvinist.
<br>
<p>Your &quot;awkwardness&quot;, on the other hand, is that you cannot really
<br>
give (so far as I know) any reason why I should choose to detonate
<br>
the Tsar Bomba next to the Stathis guy in Australia, or a rock I
<br>
pick up at random.  They both emulate my friend Stathis, right?
