<p><em>&gt;&gt; What is the lowest level level of complexity in life forms that you would

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Mice? Ants? Mussels maybe?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It is also obviously impossible to answer objectively, but one has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; try.....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It depends on how you want to define consciousness and self awareness.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but asking for *definitions* is too strong, IMO.  But I know
<br>
what you mean, and I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does an animal experience pain if you observe that it learns to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions that cause pain?  If so, then is autobliss.cpp conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt">http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt</a>
</em><br>
<p>I haven't had time to check out your program, but I don't think
<br>
that even the most sophisticated programs in the world today
<br>
quite rise to the level of some insects.  Soon that may change,
<br>
however. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some people assert that consciousness requires awareness, specifically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; episodic memory.  For example, a  person whose hippocampus was removed would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget events immediately after they happened, but could still learn skills. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If such a person underwent surgery without anesthesia, he would not recall the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pain.  But because he still has procedural memory, he would experience anxiety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the place where the torture occurred, without knowing why.
</em><br>
<p>A very valuable observation. But no one questions that such people
<br>
are conscious.  Now Terry Schiavo, that was very different  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I extended autobliss to add episodic memory (it could recall the training
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence, and recall instances of recalling it), would it be conscious?
</em><br>
<p>Surely, every such addition helps it become conscious.
<br>
I'll just have to find time this weekend to check it out.
<br>
<a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt">http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt</a> .   Thanks.

<p><em>&gt; You [M T] are confusing consciousness with ethics.
</em><br>
<p>I had supposed that M T simply felt bad about the killing and eating
<br>
of conscious creatures, on moral or ethical grounds. 
<br>
<p>You then nicely explain the sources of altruism (as in, e.g. Matt
<br>
Ridley's &quot;Origins of Virtue&quot;, 1995).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It is in the best interest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribes to practice altruism to other tribe members.  Those tribes were more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful than the anarchists, so we inherited their genes and culture.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't mean such behavior is right, just that we believe it is right.  We say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do not inflict pain on others because they are conscious like us and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not want them to inflict pain on us.  But that is just an excuse to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify our beliefs, just like we make excuses to justify killing criminals or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemies at war.
</em><br>
<p>It sounds like a good reason  more than it sounds like &quot;an excuse&quot;,
<br>
to me.  Yes we don't know what is &quot;Right&quot; with a capital R. 
<br>
We approve of some things, disapprove of others. All of us except
<br>
the psychos disapprove of needlessly and warrantlessly inflicting
<br>
pain on conscious creatures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolution does not favor compassion to other species.  Dogs and cats are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carnivores.  There is no moral dilemma for them.  But your question is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important.  We will try to apply the arguments that justify our ethics to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent machines, and our logic will fail.  There is no right answer.
</em><br>
<p>But there may be an answer on which we can achieve consensus.
<br>
Perhaps a century ago you would have said about the slavery question,
<br>
&quot;There is no right answer&quot;.  Well, maybe not, but we came to agree on
<br>
an answer that almost all of us strongly endorse.
<br>
