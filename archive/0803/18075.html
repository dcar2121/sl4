<em>&gt;&gt; Ok, then why are memories important [to people] in the first place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The explanation I'm looking for cannot:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 1) assume memories are important [to people]
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; I'll take that as a joke  :-)   though it's quite possible that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly criticized some of us for circular reasoning.
</em><br>
<p>The latter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; 2) mention concept of &quot;survival&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can you do that?
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; I think so. Suppose that people are different from each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of specific characteristics, brain structures, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on (and not because their soul has a different #ID-num).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree with the assumption that people are different. I disagree with why 
<br>
they are different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose further that in general people don't want to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more like someone else than like themselves;  specifically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person X does not want to lose what makes him X and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become, say, his friend Max (person Y).
</em><br>
<p>Let's focus on this because this is where you are assuming what I'm asking you to 
<br>
explain. Why is it important to be *like* something? As before, concept of 
<br>
&quot;survival&quot; cannot be used in the explanation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you got all of Lee Corbin's memories and retained none of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slawek's then would you (on your idea of what you &quot;is&quot;) behave more like Lee or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more like Slawek?  Specifically, what if I credibly offer to pay you $100,000,000 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to let
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your memories be entirely replaced by mine. Would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the deal?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but under one condition. You couldn't erase or alter my views on survival. 
<br>
This would prevent you from easily convincing this now rich mind instance, formerly 
<br>
labeled &quot;Slawek,&quot; from giving back your money and shutting down what you perceive 
<br>
as a worthless copy without any resistance. Nice try, Lee. You are evil. ;-)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; No, I'm equally unattached to &quot;my atoms&quot; (whatever that means) as I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unattached to my personal memories (hopefully, you'll see this).
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; All I can say is &quot;wow!&quot;.  Hmm.  Would you settle, say, for $25,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in *cash*?  I could use the New Jersey runtime.
</em><br>
<p>I get the feeling that, after I told you my survival is not attached to my
<br>
memories, you're immediately jumping to wrong conclusion that memories must be
<br>
cheap or even worthless. Absolutely not. The point is that personal memories are
<br>
precious, but their loss/replacement doesn't kill me (just like some 
<br>
loss/replacement of atoms doesn't kill me). I compared memories to clothes before 
<br>
and I think it's a pretty good analogy. Or let's try jewelry. It's very expensive 
<br>
and
<br>
can have a huge sentimental value for people, yet its loss doesn't kill the owner.
<br>
I view memories in a similar way.  They do not define my existence even though
<br>
they're worth much more than $25K. :-)
<br>
<p>(I'm pretty sure that in the future, you'll be able to &quot;purchase&quot; and download very 
<br>
cool memories from virtual &quot;stores&quot; (and that's even before your inevitable and 
<br>
desirable tranformation into a completely different/alien psychological construct). 
<br>
These memories will be at least 100 times more vivid, meaningful and fun than your 
<br>
old memories and you'll want to remember them. After you get them, you won't even 
<br>
bother accessing the old, boring ones. And you definitely will not want to access 
<br>
this one really annoying memory of me telling you in 2008 that memories were 
<br>
expendable, like jewelry. ;-))
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; There *are* other things I can be attached to, you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like what?
</em><br>
<p>Before an answer could make sense I would have to disengage two gears currently
<br>
fully meshed and rotating at a high speed in your mind. There's a lot of inertia 
<br>
I'm working against here. :-) The first gear is called &quot;personal memories&quot; that 
<br>
happily engages the second gear called &quot;survival&quot;. Before a replacement gear can 
<br>
engage &quot;survival&quot; gear, first I have to disengage &quot;personal
<br>
memories&quot; from &quot;survival&quot; by getting to the core of why memories are important or 
<br>
why &quot;being like&quot; something is important. After you'll see that this core is hollow, 
<br>
it should be easier to describe an alternative core that isn't so hollow.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Back to the main question about importance of memories [to people]. See if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; dilemma clarifies anything. If you had to choose between 2 options, which one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would you prefer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Option 1) In 1 minute you will go into an eternal coma. On the bright side, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are guaranteed that your brain, and thus your memories, will remain exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; way they are now until the end of Universe.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Arghh!  No runtime :-(   No processing.  No more happy moments for Lee :-(
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, so what does that tell you about importance of runtime vs. memories? You 
<br>
could have had all your memories intact forever and yet you didn't choose this 
<br>
option. Interesting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Option 2) In 1 minute all your personal memories will be completely erased
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from your brain, but, other than that, this brain will function just like any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; other healthy brain that's able to form and retain new personal memories and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; remember all the general knowledge acquired throughout the brain's life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like being able to speak, read and write English, do math, etc. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this brain will not remember its name, its opinions, its family and friends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; its tastes, where it's located, none of that personal stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Option 2 is only slightly preferable because I'm still a bit of an idealist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and think that it's better for some mystery person (whoever he is) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist than not exist.  But alas, for me, selfishly?  To me, I'm dead as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a doornail either way.
</em><br>
<p>If you're dead, then who is this new person in the 2nd option? Should he continue 
<br>
to bear Lee Corbin label or continue to have an access to Lee Corbin's bank 
<br>
account? When Ronald Reagan died, nobody questioned it was Ronald Reagan who died, 
<br>
and not some John Doe. If people thought he was John Doe, would cable news stations 
<br>
have shown 3-4-hour live coverage from his funeral?  These are all fun things to 
<br>
think about. I would still be interested in people answering these even though the 
<br>
bigger point to be made here is that polls are a poor way of determining whether 
<br>
something is true or correct.
