I like the thread reword. The old thread is starting to meander and get
<br>
unfocused and inane.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Yeah, sometimes there is objective meaning---sometimes not. There are two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases. The first I call &quot;isomorphic meaning&quot;, and the second &quot;conventional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ok...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would caution again: only *sometimes*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, that sequence has enough *isomorphic* meaning to be deciphered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by an enemy code breaker or an alien intelligence (assuming, as is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable to assume, that to be sufficiently intelligent is to be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;see&quot; and figure out such sequences).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, hence the example.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But if they sent us one of their sacred stones, we would eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find the non-random redundant pattern in the radioactive decay....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Great example. We would find the pattern because it is objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, and its Komolgorov complexity is less than that of a random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; string. (Of course, after breaking the &quot;code&quot; we might still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally baffled by *conventional* meaning embedded, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what &quot;jerryfooling up&quot; means to them, or that Xmaph is one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their kings.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>yes, almost trivially. but unfortunately necessary apparently to point out.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Isn't this analogous to the code-maker's efforts to change frequencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extremely often in order to thwart enemy decryption? But even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those cases, if there really is a pattern there, sooner or later others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break the code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Naturally, there has to be *isomorphic* meaning in, say, a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passage.  No one can break the following code I just invented five
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seconds ago that in a *convention* I just created five seconds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago:  &quot;ACJXM  TBBCP  EHYSK QNLRZ&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Here is where I think one point is important to make however, that no
<br>
communication is completely devoid of contextual cues.
<br>
Your ACJXM TBBCP EHYSK QNLRZ may seem opaque without reading your
<br>
translation, but thats because it was embedded in communication that
<br>
utilized a marginally different code (english) to convey meaning, and the
<br>
code (your code) itself conveyed message in a more meta-pragmatic way than
<br>
the email itself did. Rather than have internal meaning, the meaning you
<br>
intended to convey was through the *existence* of the message itself--
<br>
namely, that specific codes can exist.
<br>
<p>In English the separation between context and explicit information is often
<br>
fairly salient. It is done through, for a single example usage of pronouns.
<br>
Like in the previous sentence, the word 'it' referred to contextual
<br>
information located in the sentence before it.
<br>
<p>If we move to a code we do not all immediately have a grasp of however,
<br>
context is information since less is understood from the outset. I can infer
<br>
a fairly large amount of information from your code even without your
<br>
translation. A few examples: it is produced by a person. It is likely
<br>
produced by a person who speaks English. Its existence communicates some
<br>
type of information regarding the opacity or transparency of specific codes
<br>
of communication.
<br>
<p>At any rate the distinction becomes less clear. But it would also make sense
<br>
to talk about isomorphisms of context, in addition to isomorphisms of
<br>
signal.
<br>
<p>Rgds,
<br>
<p>Ross
