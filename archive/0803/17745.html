<p><em>&gt; hmmm, lets define this a bit clearer. When Stathis mentioned that it had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no input or output, I assumed that it was not causally interactive with anything. 
</em><br>
<p>But he said  it was right in front of him and that he did not
<br>
understand its architecture.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it has causal interaction, then I take back the statement that its not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a useful question.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, well, it at least does reflect photons evidently, and we can
<br>
measure its mass  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However we still have to deal with Heisenberg. By tinkering with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or observing its insides are we disturbing the natural flow of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation of an apple?
</em><br>
<p>That would be a real danger, all right. It could be so delicate that
<br>
as you say, it cannot be observed without changing it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are we disturbing it, in fact, in the exact same way as observing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 'real' apple would disturb an apple?
</em><br>
<p>I claim that we never disturb an apple by observing it, though the
<br>
word &quot;observe&quot; is too often used by people in unusual ways. To me,
<br>
an apple under ordinary conditions is already reflecting light. We 
<br>
don't do anything to it, just collect those photons later, perhaps
<br>
much later, and perhaps very very far away. The point is that
<br>
it stays very much an apple regardless.
<br>
<p>The observer effect comes up when we have to deliberately
<br>
send signals to something to learn about it, and thereby alter it
<br>
(to put it as simply as I can in a way that's still relevant).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If by observing its internal processes we cause different consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the simulated apple than we would with the real apple, I wonder if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can still be said to be simulating an apple. 
</em><br>
<p>The question would be, &quot;how different are those consequences&quot;?
<br>
They could be sufficiently great so as to violate its &quot;apple nature&quot;, i.e.,
<br>
it would no longer be in the &quot;space&quot; of all apples. Under such 
<br>
change, the device could no longer be said to be simulating an apple.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Lee
