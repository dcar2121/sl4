</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very clear.
</em><br>
<p>Thank-you for following the thought experiment so closely so far.
<br>
However, I think I have made an error by writing writing &quot;there will
<br>
definitely be a causal link&quot; above. In the extreme case, the operator
<br>
might transfer every possible state in sequence, knowing but not
<br>
saying which of these is the right one to implement the computation.
<br>
Does that count as a causal link on the run in which this occurs? As
<br>
far as you can tell by observing him, the operator is no more
<br>
knowledgeable than an ignorant person trying out every possible state.
<br>
Could the computation possibly divine his mental state in order to
<br>
decide whether there is a causal link and thereby become conscious?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may (or may not) be simpler, as you suggest, to suppose that all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that is necessary is that the right physical states occur or are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  implemented somehow.  I doubt very much that there is a logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  flaw in your suggestion.  On the other hand, I doubt that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  any insoluble problem with mine---just a bit of awkwardness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  e.g., why is a 3+1 dimensional creature conscious, a 2+1 dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  creature conscious (as in Flatland or the Life Board), but a 3 dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  frozen block that is *completely* isomorphic to the 2+1 structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not conscious?
</em><br>
<p>How can you be so sure about that last point?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Your &quot;awkwardness&quot;, on the other hand, is that you cannot really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  give (so far as I know) any reason why I should choose to detonate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the Tsar Bomba next to the Stathis guy in Australia, or a rock I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  pick up at random.  They both emulate my friend Stathis, right?
</em><br>
<p>If a rock emulates anything then blowing it up isn't going to make any
<br>
difference, since the point is that it doesn't matter what the rock's
<br>
atoms are doing. On the other hand, if you blow up the physical
<br>
Stathis, that would mean that at least some branches of the
<br>
computations in Platonia simulating me come to an abrupt end. So, even
<br>
though whatever will be will be, I prefer that you blow up the rock.
