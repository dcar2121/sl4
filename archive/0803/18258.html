</em><br>
<p>Ok, I think I see why you got the right answer.  It's because of two things.
<br>
<p>First, you're using the formula for the entropy of a black hole.  And
<br>
this is where the Bekenstein bound comes from.  It's just the Area in
<br>
Planck units divided by 4.  The reason they are the same is because a
<br>
black hole is the maximum amount of stuff you can store in a region of
<br>
space... it's the only thing that saturates the bound.  So that part
<br>
makes sense.
<br>
<p>Second, you're figuring out what the Scharwzchild radius is if you put
<br>
a whole bunch of matter in a volume that is the size of our universe.
<br>
It looks like you're using the Hubble radius to estimate that.  I
<br>
don't think that's really the right radius to use, but it happens to
<br>
be within on order of magnitude away from the deSitter horizon... and
<br>
a related fact is that the amount of dark energy happens to be roughy
<br>
the same order of magnitude as the total amount of matter in the
<br>
universe... so that if you calculate the Schwarzchild radius for that
<br>
amount of matter, you get back roughly the size of the universe again.
<br>
&nbsp;Sometimes this is called the &quot;coincidence problem&quot;.  As far as I
<br>
know, the only known explanation for this is the anthropic
<br>
principle... the amount of dark energy and dark matter have to be
<br>
roughly equal in order for life to exist.  And that only happens at a
<br>
special time during the universe's evolution.  So we happen to be at
<br>
that special time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  No, I divide the volume of the universe by S and get the volume of a baryon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  S depends only on T, c, h, and G, not on the properties of baryons or any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  other particles.
</em><br>
<p>Same thing.  You're dividing the volume of the universe by S to get
<br>
the volume of a baryon (or equivalently, dividing the volume of the
<br>
universe by the volume of a baryon to get S).  Either way, this is not
<br>
meaningful since it's based on volume and not area.  You can fit a
<br>
whole lot of bits inside the volume of a baryon (about 10^30 bits I
<br>
think).  So that's a lot more than 1.  It's just that you can't fit
<br>
that number of bits in *every* volume that size at once, because they
<br>
will have correlations between them due to their gravitational
<br>
interactions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Dark energy doesn't explain why the expansion of the universe is accelerating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It is just an observation.  It seems to me this behavior should be explainable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in the framework of Einstein's field equations.
</em><br>
<p>As you say, the definition of &quot;dark energy&quot; is just &quot;whatever is
<br>
making the universe accelerate&quot;.  In the Standard Model of Cosmology
<br>
(aka Lambda-CDM), this is Einstein's cosmological constant (also known
<br>
as &quot;vacuum energy&quot;).  Yes, it *is* a part of Einstein's field
<br>
equations.  It's just that this constant is very nearly zero (in
<br>
Planck units, it's 10^-120) so for a long time people thought it was
<br>
zero and didn't bother to include it in some introductory GR courses.
<br>
But it is a part of GR... this has been discussed on this list before.
<br>
<p>Is it possible that the dark energy is really something more than just
<br>
Einstein's equations?  Perhaps, but I doubt it.  The simplest
<br>
explanation is that it's just Einstein's cosmological constant, which
<br>
so far fits all observations and perfectly explains the acceleration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Likewise, inflation does not explain the uniformity of the cosmic microwave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  background.  To me, it is a kludge.  Maybe the big bang didn't start with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  single point.  I mean, how do we know it did.
</em><br>
<p>Inflation certainly explains the uniformity of the CMB... but if you
<br>
want to criticize it, you could argue that it also introduces a number
<br>
of problems of its own.  Nevertheless, it's by far the best theory we
<br>
have and has made some impressive predictions which have come true and
<br>
show that it's on the right track.  As far as I know, nobody thinks
<br>
that the big bang started at a single point.  That's not a part of the
<br>
big bang theory.
