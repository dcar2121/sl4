On Wed, 12 Mar 2008 21:01:51 +1100, &quot;Stathis Papaioannou&quot;
<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:stathisp@gmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Is%20a%20Person%20One%20or%20Many?">stathisp@gmail.com</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can only experience being a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person at the one time
</em><br>
<p>I can only experience being one person (not entirely true but I’ll let
<br>
it go) but lots of people can have the experience of having been me, and
<br>
they would have as much a right to call themselves John K Clark as I do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there is no magical process telling you that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are 100 other copies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you or what those copies are up to. 
</em><br>
<p>If the environment those other copies live in is so similar to mine that
<br>
they have not diverged then I know exactly what all those other copies
<br>
are up to.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, the illusion of a mind […]
</em><br>
<p>When I become king it will be illegal to use the word “illusion” in any
<br>
conversation about consciousness; invoking a subjective process to
<br>
explain subjectivity is just not helpful. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; there is no way to tell that the information came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from one hard disk or another, if both of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard disks had the same information. 
</em><br>
<p>Think about it, if there is no way to tell then that must mean it will
<br>
make no difference to the physical universe which hard drive the
<br>
information came from; if the universe doesn’t care I don’t see why I
<br>
should.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This means that if there are 101 identical copies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are definitely only one of those copies
</em><br>
<p>If they are identical then I am all those copies. If they started having
<br>
different experiences they would still remember being me but they would
<br>
not remember being one of there fellow copies, they would diverge. Now
<br>
there would be 101 distinct individuals but they would all be John K
<br>
Clark.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If this next moment involves opening the envelope,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you will end up finding that you are one (and only one)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the 100 copies that reads &quot;no torture&quot; or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single copy that reads &quot;torture&quot;. So you are 100 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times as likely to read &quot;no torture&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>Your arithmetic is wrong. There are 2 versions of me, one gets tortured
<br>
and one does not, you figure out the odds.
<br>
<p>It’s interesting that all the confusion and paradoxes about this topic
<br>
vanishes if you just make one small change in viewpoint. Try thinking of
<br>
yourself as an adjective not a noun. Try it, you’d be amazed how much
<br>
clearer things become.
