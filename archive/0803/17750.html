</em><br>
<p>Not exactly: he says that all mathematical structures are eternally
<br>
and necessarily implemented, and that mathematical structures are all
<br>
there is (eg. see this recent short paper:
<br>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.4024">http://arxiv.org/pdf/0709.4024</a>). One obvious objection to this idea is
<br>
that that physical objects seem to be *different things* compared to
<br>
mathematical objects; a physical circle is the same shape as its
<br>
platonic counterpart, but that's about all they have in common. On the
<br>
other hand, if we look at computations as one subtype of mathematical
<br>
object, the situation seems to be reversed. The computation as seen
<br>
from the inside (consciousness) seems to be a different thing compared
<br>
to the substrate of its implementation: it is nothing like the neurons
<br>
or semiconductors or gears and cogs, and it can produce its own
<br>
solid-seeming physical objects which need bear no relationship to the
<br>
substance of the computer. Indeed, multiple realisability and the
<br>
arguments presented in this thread (as well as other arguments such as
<br>
in this paper by Tim Maudlin:
<br>
<a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-362X%28198908%2986%3A8%3C407%3ACAC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-A">http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-362X%28198908%2986%3A8%3C407%3ACAC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-A</a>)
<br>
suggest that consciousness is necessarily a property of the
<br>
computation as platonic object, and only contingently a property of
<br>
physical objects that happen to be isomorphic to this platonic object.
<br>
This is analogous to roundness being necessarily a property of circles
<br>
as platonic objects, and only a property of physical objects insofar
<br>
as they happen to be isomorphic with a circle.
