<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Why do you believe preservation of memories is important in the first place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I meant, important for survival. If you irretrievably lose your memories, I say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; then you're dead. The cryonicists who obsess over all this strongly agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know, but they can never explain why...There has to be a reason why they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think memories are important to survival. What is it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So if survival is important to you, and you wonder about memory, then please
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; see my reply to Stuart at Tuesday, March 11, 2008 7:48 AM in this thread.
</em><br>
<p>All right. So you, like most of us, are concerned that Slawek live through
<br>
the rest of today, and---God willing---through the rest of the year and so on?
<br>
Sorry, but I have to make sure, because your views are at quite a variance
<br>
with almost everyone else's on these lists, as you know, with great potential
<br>
for miscommunication.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I couldn't find the answer in your reply. There was only one reply, right?
</em><br>
<p>Oops, sorry Slawek.  It depended partly on a previous email.
<br>
<p>But never mind.  Here goes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you and I exchange any given body part (except the brain)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then it's still clear afterwards who you are and who I am. But
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suppose that somehow we could exchange cognitive ability,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchange temperament, and exchange the instinctive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compassion we have for others. What then?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I might find myself suddenly able to think more clearly,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and perhaps find myself emotionally on a much more even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keel a lot of the time, and maybe having intense empathy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and compassion for innocents I see wronged in movies or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in real life.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is it that has kept me &quot;me&quot;?  I say it's memories.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, if we suddenly exchanged *memories*, then you would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very suddenly find yourself in a townhouse in Santa Clara
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California, needing always two or three pairs of glasses,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having little depth perception because of a weak left eye,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maybe being a lot taller or shorter, or heavier or leaner.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With just the memories exchanged, you might suddenly find
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also that you could visualize more easily than before, but that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logic seemed harder, or other things to that effect.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would *not* say to yourself, &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not Slawek
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anymore.  I must be someone else.&quot;  No.  You would say
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME?  What
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just *happened*??  AND WHAT AM I, SLAWEK, doing  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here? and why is everything blurry when I look across the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room?  Whose body is this?  It's not *mine*!&quot;
<br>
<p>I think that it's a *fact* that you would speak and think just like
<br>
that.  You would then, surely, be forced to admit that you went
<br>
with your memories when they were transferred to California.
<br>
<p>Continuing:  Next we swap your memories with some poor
<br>
device, like an ant, that can't work with them or do them
<br>
justice.  Or we move your memories onto a blank DVD
<br>
and move the empty contents of the blank DVD into Slawek's
<br>
body.  Then I claim you are dead, and won't be revived until
<br>
the swap is reversed, if that's still possible (probably not in
<br>
the case of the ant).
<br>
<p>So, you see, you really are your memories, and if they're lost
<br>
then so are you.
<br>
<p>Lee
