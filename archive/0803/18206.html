<p><p><em>&gt; [Lee had written]

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Suppose that by some *obvious* [1] isomorphism, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; today Lee is one bit string
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 11011011001110010110111111001010110100000011...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and tomorrow I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 11011011001110010110011111001010110100000010...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; where two 0's happen to be changed to 1's.  By all measures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of similarity, those two strings are still very similar. (It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; easy to mention some particular measures used by mathematicians,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but the ones I'm completely familiar with without having to go look
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them up aren't very applicable here.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps I am missing the point of this discussion, but the standard way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure the difference between two strings x and y is K(x|y) + K(y|x) where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; K(x|y) is the length of the shortest program that inputs y and outputs x.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks Matt!  Hopefully if I had gone and tried to look up that
<br>
stuff, I would have encountered that vastly more compact and
<br>
simpler notion of similarity between strings.
<br>
<p>What do you think of pushing that idea for 2D patterns on a Life Board?
<br>
(Easy, I would suppose.)  What about for two grains of salt?  Think that
<br>
it can consistently and advisably be stated also in terms of Komolgorov
<br>
complexity?  What about large 3D or 4D objects in general?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, what is the conceptual difficulty of having the memories of two people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who lived separate lives?
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's for another thread, but let's briefly consider two cases.
<br>
<p>1. The two people in question are Julius Caesar and George Patton.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the sudden merger (merged guy) is baffled and very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confused.  But then, rather easily I suspect since each was a bit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a mystic by our standards, the Patton memories would be used
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to formulate the hypothesis that he was really the incarnation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julius Caesar, (a thought that would not displease him in the least,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think).  The problem could be minimal, except for certain values,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like, &quot;should all the inhabitants of certain conquered territories be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exterminated for the sake of future safety&quot;?   But hell, that happens
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to all of us (well, not so graphically, or literally, of course). Whenever
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you act in a certain way for a specific reason, you may recall that a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some time earlier in your life (or earlier in your day) that you acted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the opposite way.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now this is the *conceptual* difficulty, as you asked. The practical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficulty, as when we discussed merging Shakespeare and Einstein,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would still be enormous. 
<br>
<p>2. The two people led concurrent lives, and perhaps had opposing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goals, mutual hatred, and so on.  You could end up with a very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distraught, confused, and possibly mentally ill patient on your
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands.
<br>
<p>(if you reply to that last part, why don't you merge it back into
<br>
the Memory Merging thread?  thank you)
<br>
<p>Lee
