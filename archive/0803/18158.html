<p><p><em>&gt; The original context was a fictional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario where you listened to a 20 minute tale of your wife's day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a level of detail that is &quot;just the facts,&quot; detail that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes humorous situations perhaps only your wife would find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant, details that includes particular facial expressions...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was using 'nuances' to include those details which provide only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subtle refinements on a reasonably useful answer to the question,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;How was your day?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the explanation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  In other words... you missed that point.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the only time that this has ever happened to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was perhaps of tertiary importance to what I was saying.  It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become a distraction.  I would have aggressively trimmed this from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my reply, but I think it served as a self-referential example.
</em><br>
<p>I see  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  It is similarity of structure, ultimately.  Of course, we have various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Suppose that by some *obvious* [1] isomorphism,  today
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Lee is one bit string where two 0's happen to be changed to 1's.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  By all measures of similarity, those two strings are still very similar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your definition of similar is not sufficient for me to make sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your bit string analogy.  I &quot;get&quot; that there might be some reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to TM or Life Board in there, but I'd have to guess too much.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I started a new thread called &quot;Similarity of Structure&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm learning that when I assume too much agreement I will find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later that whatever building goes up will inevitably be torn down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to its unstable foundation.
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps not &quot;inevitably&quot;.  But you are dead right that this
<br>
happens far too often, and we all have to be on the lookout for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If the teleporter or copying machinery is working well, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will be very few bit errors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll grant that you have a perfect copy maker including the dimension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time, such that all bits recording one's existence up to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the copy are absolutely identical.  Each instance has their new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience encoded and appended to the identical stream of bits that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were absolutely perfectly copied.  Using the Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;etc notation from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another current thread, I would imagine normal/expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causation-induced changes between states over a small interval of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be similar (though I am not 100% certain how to accurately measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to five nines precision, right?)
</em><br>
<p>I'm not certain either, but I believe that it can be done. We can take
<br>
it up further in the &quot;Similarity of Structure&quot; thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; [...]memories [..] are used to determine identity up to the point of copy [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Yes. Or new experiences which create or destroy small parts of the structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are allowing new experience to create or destroy parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure?  That is inconsistent with your definition of preserving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information as the True history of an entity's existence.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that the &quot;history&quot; as such---that is, a detailed record
<br>
of how all the little changes get made day in and day out in an
<br>
individual---is important. What is important is that my memory,
<br>
say, of my elementary school not undergo damage.  But it's okay
<br>
if I forget the name of a certain leader of a foreign nation.  I call
<br>
that &quot;creating&quot; and &quot;destroying&quot; small parts of the structure. Bad
<br>
word choice?  Clearly something was destroyed---information
<br>
of some kind was lost---when I forgot whats-his-name. 
<br>
<p>Now it's also true, incidentally, that the more we can, for example,
<br>
remember about details of our daily life, the better that our identities
<br>
are preserved over time. What unfortunately will make me almost
<br>
not the same person 40 years from now---new medical tech aside
<br>
---is that I will have forgotten so much about the way I am now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once the log is open for editing, there will be no integrity to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure.
</em><br>
<p>You mean, for example, when once we're uploaded and we have
<br>
the power to edit any of our memories easily and at-will?  Well,
<br>
yes, then someone would have the ability to utterly destroy his
<br>
personal &quot;integrity&quot; if you will, his wholeness and what it is about
<br>
him that makes him who he is.  But I suspect that I'm not reading
<br>
you right. You need to elaborate? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By this possibility I could simply edit-in or edit-out any memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to force the checksum in your similarity measure.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, it's not a checksum, which is a many-to-one mapping. It's
<br>
a perfect hash, say, or a scan of the kind that can be counted
<br>
upon for re-creating someone.  E.g., we assume that the 
<br>
information, probably sent bit-by-bit by Scotty's teleporter,
<br>
is enough to re-create a very, very convincing replica of 
<br>
Captain Kirk.  Damn, it occurs to me that I could have saved
<br>
a lot of words in the new Similarity of Structure post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is all made up TE anyway, so even if I can't hack your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory gracefully I should be able to do so by brute force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oops, didn't get it right on the first try... maybe I'll get it on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the second attempt, or fifty-second attempt.
</em><br>
<p>If you mean the dystopian nightmare of the authorities being
<br>
able to redact or alter someone's memories, why, yes, no
<br>
reason in principle that they couldn't hack my memories. 
<br>
If they went far enough, I'd turn from a Winston Smith
<br>
into an O'Brien in no time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have consistently used &quot;belief&quot; to indicate a subjective understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the facts available to a clone.  (eg:  the clone believes itself to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be...  or I believe X from a subjective measure.)  I certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the confusion this may cause since the word belief is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overloaded with meaning such that it should perhaps not be used at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I use &quot;belief&quot; like that for the relationship between what
<br>
people think they know and what is true.  Eliezer has described
<br>
this in detail in Overcoming Bias sometime in the last few days.
<br>
Anyway, I guess that the word is being used the same way right
<br>
now here in this thread, and probably need concern us no longer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; close duplicates should merge at least as easily as they are created?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I don't see how that last statement follows from anything above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do not know how to proceed.  The statement does not follow from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything above, it was the starting point for my participation in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has taken this dialog to reach the point of agreement above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I imagine this is where in an in-person conversation that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us would offer to refresh drinks, then start again on a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic upon returning.  :)
</em><br>
<p>Oh, okay.  But you don't defend &quot;close duplicates should merge
<br>
at least as easily as they are created&quot;?  Or 'twas someone else
<br>
said that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I imagine this is where in an in-person conversation that one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us would offer to refresh drinks, then start again on a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic upon returning.  :)
</em><br>
<p>Entirely possible.  Sometimes these kinds of discussions really 
<br>
do peter out  :-)   But surely something I've said above in this
<br>
not-very-short post seems either wrong or too confusing.
