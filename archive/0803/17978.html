<em>&gt; Hmm.  It's a variation that I don't remember encountering in all these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  years. Might be worth pursuing in a new thread.  Surely you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  undergone grueling experiences.  While they were occuring did you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ever happen to say to yourself, &quot;Well, Stuart is dead, not sure if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  want to go back to being Stuart or staying the new person that I am?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Or anything along those lines?
</em><br>
<p>I never thought along those lines (though now I might). I have often
<br>
thought about going back to the person I once was, and am sure that
<br>
the past Stuart would not recognise me as the same person.
<br>
<p>The situation changes, though, if there are duplicates! Then I can no
<br>
longer continue to carry the mantle of Stuart just out of laziness;
<br>
because &quot;well, I'm the closest thing around to what Stuart once was&quot;.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this example hints at what the problem is: maybe we shouldn't
<br>
be thinking &quot;me and my duplicate are the same person, just as me today
<br>
and me last year&quot;, but rather &quot;me today and me next year are a
<br>
different person, just as two of my duplicates in different
<br>
circumstances.&quot;
<br>
<p>Stuart (...I think...)
