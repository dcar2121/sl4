</em><br>
<em>&gt; ended up behaving completely differently after only a few short days.
</em><br>
<p><p>BTW, I have very little respect for Zimbardo's experiment.
<br>
I think that he led his students along, and rather visibly
<br>
approved as they began acting rather savagely. There was
<br>
a political point at stake, you know.
<br>
<p>And how UNFORTUNATE:  The experiment can never
<br>
be repeated on *ethical grounds*. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I am glad to see---finally---after all these years, sustained
<br>
criticism of that experiment (the nice criticism portion of the
<br>
above article).
<br>
<p>WAIT!   Oh, for joy!  For joy!  The blessed Wikipedia article
<br>
goes on to validate what I have suspected all these decades:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haslam and Reicher
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex Haslam and Steve Reicher (2003), psychologists from the University of Exeter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and University of St Andrews, conducted a partial replication of the experiment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the assistance of the BBC, who broadcast scenes from the study as a reality TV
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;program called The Experiment. Their results and conclusions were very different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Zimbardo's and led to a number of publications on tyranny, stress and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leadership (moreover, unlike results from the SPE, these were published in leading
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;academic journals; e.g., British Journal of Social Psychology, Journal of Applied
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychology, Social Psychology Quarterly) . While their procedure was not a direct
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replication of Zimbardo's, their study does cast further doubt on the generality of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his conclusions.
<br>
<p>And the last sentence is the clincher!  Wait till I tell some of my friends
<br>
this exciting news:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, it questions the notion that people slip mindlessly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into role and the idea that the dynamics of evil are in any way banal. Their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research also points to the importance of leadership in the emergence of tyranny
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(of the form displayed by Zimbardo when briefing guards in the Stanford
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experiment).
<br>
<p>As I had guessed:  Zimbardo got the results he wanted. Maybe even an
<br>
example of 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pygmalion effect, or more commonly known as the &quot;teacher-expectancy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect&quot; refers to situations in which students perform better than .
