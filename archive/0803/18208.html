</em><br>
<p>(BTW, would you mind supplying a bit more context, like just what
<br>
question I was trying to answer?   I just don't remember exactly where
<br>
we are in these multiple threads, especially with a brain that badly
<br>
needs an upgrade. And besides, I've been spoiled by Stathis and
<br>
some of the other superb communicators on this list.)
<br>
<p>Ah... well... all in a night's work.  I'll go back and quote more of
<br>
what I said (and maybe what you said)  &lt;sighs with great weariness&gt;
<br>
<p>Oh, that wasn't too hard to find.  I didn't post but one or two items
<br>
in this thread.  Whew!
<br>
<p>Said I: 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Heartland wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; you can't seem to comprehend why you could have the same process
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; using different atoms and different processes using the same atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; John, let's say that you have purchased one copy of a simple computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; program, and you run it on two of your ancient 286 Intel machines
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; under QNX or MS-DOS or whatever OS is on them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The two processes, though on different machines, are identical to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That is, what can you [say] about one process that you can't say about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the other, except for &quot;they are not running on the same machine&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;they were not started at exactly the same time&quot;, and &quot;one may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; executing slightly more slowly than the other for some dumb reason&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And just what is so different about these different machines? Why atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course, it always comes back to atoms.  
</em><br>
<p>WELL, SO WHAT?  Heartland SAID  &quot;you could have the same
<br>
process using different atoms&quot;.   In your one line no doubt rather
<br>
hastily snapped off reply, you disagreed with both his claims there.
<br>
<p>I am addressing  (patience, Lee, patience) the *first* of Heartland's
<br>
claims, namely &quot;you could have the same process using different
<br>
atoms&quot;. 
<br>
<p>He is right!  Admit it!  It won't kill you for once in your life to say
<br>
that you misunderstood, or whatever.
<br>
<p>Then I proceeded to list some differences that can exist in the way
<br>
that the processes are run, just to be thorough.  But you took 
<br>
exception to that too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; one may be executing slightly more slowly than the other [.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A good thought experiment should be as simple and bare bones as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, you're adding crappy copies and all sorts of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complications that add nothing to understanding.  
</em><br>
<p>You're simply not taking the time to read carefully.  As soon as
<br>
someone says &quot;John Clark wrote...&quot; you go into assault mode.
<br>
I'm AGREEING with you that these things DO NOT affect
<br>
the *PROCESS*.  But that just goes to prove that what he
<br>
said was *correct*:  you *can* have the same process running
<br>
on two different machines, er, two different sets of atoms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;As for different processes using the same atoms [.] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Read what heartland wrote, he was talking about different atoms using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same atoms, I don't know what he was trying to say and I doubt if he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knows either.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, here is what he said, once again:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &gt; you can't seem to comprehend why you could have the same process
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; using different atoms and different processes using the same atoms.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Perhaps you think that he meant *concurrently*?  Maybe in the
<br>
same machine?  I don't know what you were assuming, but you didn't
<br>
want to give an iota of possibility that &quot;your enemy&quot; might, just might,
<br>
have said something that was not horribly, hideously, and totally wrong.
<br>
<p>Notice that I'm not asking you to show true guts and apologize,
<br>
just acknowledge---using whatever excuse you want, (say that his
<br>
writing style was so bad that....), that his first of the two claims,
<br>
which was, once again, namely
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; you could have the same process [going] using different atoms 
</em><br>
<p>was not incorrect.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Ten-to-one JC comes back with a one-liner and says
<br>
&quot;then it's not the same process&quot;, and if I ask him why not,
<br>
he'll probably have to say, &quot;well, it's not the same atoms
<br>
at the same time&quot;   :-)
