<p>This is of course true, which is why I noted that the problem is &quot;deep and
<br>
difficult&quot;. Nevertheless, I feel personally that the problem should be
<br>
addressed somehow by the scientific community. If the only effect of the
<br>
non-military use clause is to raise awareness, that seems worthwhile to me.

<p><p>My view on the subject, perhaps in contrast to the prevailing list
<br>
sentiment, is that this form of strong general AI is not likely in the
<br>
immediate future (15 years, say). In my view, narrow AI (computer vision,
<br>
speech recognition, mobile robotics) is much more likely. Furthermore, these
<br>
technologies will provide governments enormous powers of coercion and
<br>
surveillance over their citizens. In contrast, while the new narrow AI
<br>
technology will also be available to the citizenry, it will not provide
<br>
them/us with a comparable ability to resist government intrusion.
