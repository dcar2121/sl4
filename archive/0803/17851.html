<p>It amounts to nothing because no-one can recognise it as a
<br>
computation. The causal connection is necessary to make it useful, and
<br>
if it isn't useful then we may as well say it isn't a computation at
<br>
all. I completely agree with this. But if the computation in question
<br>
gives rise to consciousness, it *doesn't matter* that no-one
<br>
recognises it as a computation, since consciousness is not contingent
<br>
on an external observer. If we have a random system which, purely by
<br>
chance, will have hidden somewhere within it the lottery numbers, so
<br>
what? But if the random system has hidden within it processes
<br>
corresponding to a mind, why should that mind be any less conscious
<br>
for the fact that it is hidden from
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But I grant than many differ, and the question almost surely
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>The Monday/Tuesday example I gave before still works with classical
<br>
physics. There is nothing in your subjective experience which can give
<br>
you a clue as to whether the implementations of the two days were
<br>
causally linked or just accidentally correlated. This is a consequence
<br>
of the supervenience thesis in philosophy of mind: no change in mental
<br>
state without a change in physical state.
