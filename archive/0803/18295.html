</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is essentially circular reasoning.  DARPA et al have shown no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  capacity whatsoever to discriminate between research that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;manifestly on the right track to AI&quot; and the thousands of dead ends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  out there.  To put it another way, if they *were* capable of making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  meaningful discriminations, they would already know how to build AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and they would not need your work.
</em><br>
<p>In many problems, it is a lot easier to see a path is right than to
<br>
find a path.  E.g. NP problems. AI might be one such.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  In short, it will not be manifestly obvious that you are on the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  track until you unambiguously produce AI.
</em><br>
<p>If you know this to be the case, then you must know all possible ways
<br>
to create AI, thus you must be able to create AI ;)
<br>
<p>I think it possible that a research group might unambiguously produce
<br>
non-human level before producing human level.
<br>
<p>It might be a long slow process from say dog level to human, stopping
<br>
through human level with learning difficulties. For all we know that
<br>
might be super human learning stumbling blocks, so that we may produce
<br>
an intelligence that gets above human level then can't improve itself,
<br>
and can't see why it can't improve itself due to some faults in our
<br>
theories. A damp squib of an explosion.
<br>
<p>Another scenario it might be that a partial theory of AI is
<br>
sufficiently water tight and beautiful to convince to engineers to
<br>
follow it. Most theories have been ugly hodge-podges or based on
<br>
unrealistic assumptions.
<br>
<p>I'm not buying AI *having* to spring forth fully formed in the first
<br>
iteration of development. It might but there is no guarantee.
