<p>[To recap, we have a machine and operator in Australia and another

machine and operator in Vienna. The question is whether the Viennese
<br>
machine can continue the computation of the Australian machine, and
<br>
whether any associated consciousness also continues without
<br>
interruption. S(n) is the last state of the Australian machine which
<br>
the Australian operator notes and passes on, either explicitly or
<br>
hidden in false data, to his Viennese counterpart, who then endeavours
<br>
to calculate or look up the next state S(n+1) to input into his
<br>
machine.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see.  In other words, it's as though the Vienna operator, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  very smart dude, works out *himself* with, say, his pocket
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  calculator, S(n+1). Quite all right with me.  I don't think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ever matters where a computation is done, nor on what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hardware.  Just so that it's a real computation, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sustains real causality and information flow.
</em><br>
<p>And you will hopefully allow that in this step, working out the next
<br>
state could involve a lookup table. This low level lookup simply
<br>
mimics the physics of the machine, and is not like looking up the
<br>
answer to a computation in order to bypass all the intermediate steps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; But if the Australian operator simply provides a list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; of all possible states, knowing but not telling which one is S(n),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; that seems to me exactly the same as providing no information at all;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; i.e. the same as if the Vienna operator knew nothing about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; antipodean device and simply tried random states, one of them just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; happening to be S(n+1). How does this affect whether consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; interrupted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very good question.  In that case there is an infinitesimal interruption in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  consciousness, because there was no genuine information flow or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  causality, in other words, to me, not a real computation at all. All
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  possible things are tried in Vienna.  I think I see where you are going,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but I'll let you deliver the next blow!  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Would it make a difference if the Viennese operator worked out the
<br>
appropriate state? Here are several possibilities:
<br>
<p>(a) The file I've received says that the final state of the Australian
<br>
machine was S-6754. The successor state for that is S-2037, so if I
<br>
input that into my machine, the computation won't know it has been
<br>
spread across two continents.
<br>
<p>(b) The file I've received gives the final state of the Australian
<br>
machine as either S-6754 or S-789. Their respective successor states
<br>
are S-2037 and S-9175, so I'll try both of those, and when I get the
<br>
right one, the computation and its consciousness will have been
<br>
implemented without interruption.
<br>
<p>(c) The file from Australia lists all possible machine states S-1 to
<br>
S-9999. I have a lot of work ahead of me, but one of them has to be
<br>
the right one. First, I'll input S-1, the successor state of S-3412;
<br>
then S-2, which as everyone knows is the successor state of S-439;
<br>
next, S-3, successor of S-2031 (or was it S-3021? I always get those
<br>
two mixed up but it's definitely one or the other)... and so on to
<br>
S-9999.
<br>
<p>You can see that the Vienna operator's muttering as he goes about his
<br>
work in the last example has no effect on the mechanics of the
<br>
computation. As he inputs S-2037 he could be thinking that it is the
<br>
successor of S-6754, or he could be thinking about what he will have
<br>
for dinner, and it will make no difference to his behaviour as he is
<br>
just inputting all the states anyway.
<br>
<p>In which of the above cases is the causal link between the two
<br>
machines preserved? In which does consciousness continue
<br>
uninterrupted?
