Actually, the same solution as before -- with *much* more compelling phrasing (I think  :-)
<br>
<p>= = = = = = = = = =
<br>
<p>Hi.  I’m Mark Waser and I would like to introduce you to a new religion.
<br>
<p>This religion has changed my life.  It has given me new power to direct my life and has dramatically increased my happiness.  I believe that it can do the same thing for you.
<br>
<p>This religion is very easy to practice, never conflicts with your own personal self-interest, and even allows you to keep your current religion.
<br>
<p>To join this religion requires only two simple things:
<br>
1)	To declare that you are a member of this religion AND
<br>
2)	To act like you are a member of this religion
<br>
<p>This religion has only five fundamental beliefs:
<br>
1)	You should not interfere with other people unless it is in your TRUE self-interest to do so
<br>
2)	Interfering with other people SOLELY for personal enjoyment, money, power, or other similar things that people compete for is NOT in your true self-interest
<br>
3)	Because everyone can make mistakes, it is NOT in your true self-interest to interfere with other people SOLELY because *you* believe that it is in *their* self-interest that you do so (because people *should* be allowed to make their own mistakes)
<br>
4)	Because everyone has different beliefs about whether God exists or what God wants (and you could therefore be wrong), it is NOT in your true self-interest to interfere with other people SOLELY because of what you believe that God wants
<br>
5)	It is in everyone’s best interest to spread this religion
<br>
<p>The name of this religion is *Friendliness* (or, it can be referred to as the Friendly religion).  Members of this religion are called Friendly/Friendlies.
<br>
<p>I am a member and would very much like to talk to you further about this religion if you are interested.
<br>
<p>Thank you *very* much for your time and attention.
