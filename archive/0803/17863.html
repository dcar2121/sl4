<p><p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin kirjoitti
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I claim that isomorphic copies separated enough in spacetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to constitute separate physical processes are separate subjects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is rather nonsensical to me.
</em><br>
<p>The meanings of the word &quot;subject&quot; renders my sentence too
<br>
ambiguous to be retained, I admit. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Suppose that there is an absolutely identical you being held
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in an Earth-like simulated city near Sirius.  It ought to matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to you that one of them is going to shortly die.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're using faulty terminology to gain psychological advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for your faulty assertion. (&quot;One of them is going to shortly die&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies death of a self in this context, which really isn't the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here; see further down.)
</em><br>
<p>Surely we agree that there is a death of an instance at stake
<br>
in my scenario, and by that I mean that the normal idea of
<br>
one of the two physically running processes being destroyed.
<br>
That wording should have been clear, I claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, certainly it matters in that there'd be one less instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of me (in this universe, anyway), and therefore less redundancy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and fault-tolerance.
</em><br>
<p>We quite agree there, though perhaps for different reasons. 
<br>
My reason is that more &quot;total benefit&quot; per hour of life accrues
<br>
to the person I am, the more places and oftener I get to run.
<br>
Yours I only have a vague understanding of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Were one to go more abstract, also some of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential futures might be weeded out by that, but that happens all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time anyways without it being deadly.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An sich [As such] I see no reason to fret over one instance terminating.
</em><br>
<p>Didn't you just say &quot;certainly it matters in that there'd be one less
<br>
instance of me&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Yes, right now you are &quot;both&quot;, i.e., you can't tell whether you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on Earth or near Sirius, (and I always claim that you actually are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in both places at the same time).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good, you're somewhat sane so far. However this puts at a rather odd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light your previous statement about &quot;one of them shortly dying&quot;. Rather,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one would cease to be (instantiated) in one of the places one previously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was. This does not sync up with &quot;death&quot; in any way or form...
</em><br>
<p>Fine. As I said, by &quot;one of them shortly dying&quot;, I meant the instance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One atom missing would presumably (chaos and all) diverge the copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given some time. I don't claim to know _exactly_ where the line goes as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to when two similar processes have the same subjective existence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when they don't...
</em><br>
<p>Doesn't it have to be entirely a matter of degree, a slow change?
<br>
Myself, I would claim that given enough time they'll probably become
<br>
separate people, just as you and a copy of you living in different
<br>
cities would eventually over perhaps many decades become 
<br>
different people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyways, I generally suggest discussing digital error-resistant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes and going by rather direct mathematical comparisons of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instances; otherwise we just get into wanking over something we just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know how to properly quantify (at this point, anyway), and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't really lead anywhere productive.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I think that some progress can be made before we have to
<br>
go that far  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Incidentally and slightly relevantly...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is also relevant for the concept of &quot;local death&quot; used by Egan in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least Schild's Ladder; even a separate instance of you dying can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shrugged off as little if anything more than a slight case of amnesia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you have a timely backup.
</em><br>
<p>Fully agreed.  More about the rest of your post later.
<br>
<p>Lee
