Hi all,
<br>
<p>A lot of students email me asking me what to read to get up to speed on AGI.
<br>
<p>So I started a wiki page called &quot;Instead of an AGI Textbook&quot;,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.agiri.org/wiki/Instead_of_an_AGI_Textbook#Computational_Linguistics">http://www.agiri.org/wiki/Instead_of_an_AGI_Textbook#Computational_Linguistics</a>
<br>
<p>Unfortunately I did not yet find time to do much but outline a table
<br>
of contents there.
<br>
<p>So I'm hoping some of you can chip in and fill in some relevant
<br>
hyperlinks on the pages
<br>
I've created ;-)
<br>
<p>For those of you too lazy to click the above link, here is the
<br>
introductory note I put on the wiki page:
<br>
<p><p>********
<br>
<p>I've often lamented the fact that there is no advanced undergrad level
<br>
textbook for AGI, analogous to what Russell and Norvig is for Narrow
<br>
AI.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have time to write such a textbook, and no one
<br>
else with the requisite knowledge and ability seems to have the time
<br>
and inclination either.
<br>
<p>So, instead of a textbook, I thought it would make sense to outline
<br>
here what the table of contents of such a textbook might look like,
<br>
and to fill in each section within each chapter in this TOC with a few
<br>
links to available online resources dealing with the topic of the
<br>
section.
<br>
<p>However, all I found time to do today (March 25, 2008) is make the
<br>
TOC. Maybe later I will fill in the links on each section's page, or
<br>
maybe by the time I get around it some other folks will have done it.
<br>
<p>While nowhere near as good as a textbook, I do think this can be a
<br>
valuable resource for those wanting to get up to speed on AGI concepts
<br>
and not knowing where to turn to get started. There are some available
<br>
AGI bibliographies, but a structured bibliography like this can
<br>
probably be more useful than an unstructured and heterogeneous one.
<br>
<p>Naturally my initial TOC represents some of my own biases, but I trust
<br>
that by having others help edit it, these biases will ultimately &quot;come
<br>
out in the wash.
<br>
<p>Just to be clear: the idea here is not to present solely AGI material.
<br>
Rather the idea is to present material that I think students would do
<br>
well to know, if they want to work on AGI. This includes some AGI,
<br>
some narrow AI, some psychology, some neuroscience, some mathematics,
<br>
etc.
