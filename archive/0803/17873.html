</em><br>
<p>So I do a simulation to find the answer.  (Actually I work it out on paper
<br>
because I am too lazy to write a program).  How to model subjective
<br>
anticipation?  Typically we use probability theory as an approximation of
<br>
uncertainty.  We do this because true uncertainty (with only a Solomonoff
<br>
prior) depends on your choice of universal Turing machine, and isn't
<br>
computable anyway.
<br>
<p>So we have to construct a model where probability theory is appropriate.  If
<br>
you have never seen a coin before, you would not have any subjective
<br>
anticipation of it doing anything.  But if you flipped it hundreds of times
<br>
and about half of the time it came up heads then you could assign a
<br>
probability of 1/2.  Just to make sure, you repeat the experiment hundreds of
<br>
times, after which you conclude that there is a probability near 1 that the
<br>
probability of heads is near 1/2.
<br>
<p>So perhaps a good model of subjective anticipation in an agent is that if it
<br>
does an experiment N times and observes an outcome R times, then the
<br>
probability is guessed to be R/N as long as N is large.  It is not perfect but
<br>
it is good enough for my simulation.
<br>
<p>So now I run the simulation where every time an agent observes heads we make
<br>
100 copies of it.  After 1000 trials I end up with a huge number of agents,
<br>
most of whom have seen something like 990 heads and 10 tails.  All of these
<br>
agents will then guess that the next coin flip will be heads with probability
<br>
around 0.99.  I can repeat this experiment many times with the same result.
<br>
<p>My conclusion is that with probability near 1 an agent chosen at random will
<br>
anticipate heads with probability near 0.99.
<br>
<p>Maybe it *should* anticipate 0.5, but that's not what it will do if it is
<br>
rational.
