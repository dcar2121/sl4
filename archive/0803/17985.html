<em>&gt;    You would *not* say to yourself, &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not Slawek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    anymore.  I must be someone else.&quot;  No.  You would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &quot;WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    just *happened*??  AND WHAT AM I, SLAWEK, doing  here? and why is everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blurry when I look across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    room?  Whose body is this?  It's not *mine*!&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that it's a *fact* that you would speak and think just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.  You would then, surely, be forced to admit that you went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with your memories when they were transferred to California.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this person in California would definitely &quot;feel like Slawek&quot;, but why should
<br>
&quot;someone who feels like X&quot; imply &quot;someone is X&quot;?  I know people make this leap
<br>
without awareness of the leap, which is why it deserves attention.
<br>
<p>We could dig even deeper and ask ourselves even more fundamental question, which is
<br>
why preservation of the &quot;feeling of X&quot; is important.
