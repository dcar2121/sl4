Despite being far closer to JKC's position, here I actually disagree with
<br>
him:

</em><br>
<p>John, let's say that you have purchased one copy of a simple computer
<br>
program, and you run it on two of your ancient 286 Intel machines
<br>
under QNX or MS-DOS or whatever OS is on them.
<br>
<p>The two processes, though on different machines, are identical to me.
<br>
That is, what can you about one process that you can't say about the
<br>
the other, except for &quot;they are not running on the same machine&quot;,
<br>
&quot;they were not started at exactly the same time&quot;, and &quot;one may be
<br>
executing slightly more slowly than the other for some dumb reason&quot;.
<br>
<p>Those are extrinsic characteristics.  It would be like saying that one
<br>
of JC's characteristics is that a certain random lurker once read his
<br>
name.  True, but not *characteristic* of JC, nor one of his &quot;real&quot;
<br>
properties.
<br>
<p>So as far as I can see, yes, you can have the same process running
<br>
on different atoms.  Now if you *insist* that by your definition, no
<br>
two processes are the same, then we see that we have come merely
<br>
to a terminological impasse.  An impasse that is inconsequential 
<br>
regarding actions people will or ought to take (I think).
<br>
<p>As for different processes using the same atoms, that surely has
<br>
to be all right too.  For example, let's say that you are locked in
<br>
a steel air-tight box, heaven forbid, and you die.  After you die,
<br>
the bacteria really start to multiply rapidly.  I would say that now
<br>
we have a different process (or many different processes) running
<br>
on exactly the same atoms that JC used to run on.  Any terminology
<br>
or other problems with that?
<br>
<p>Lee
