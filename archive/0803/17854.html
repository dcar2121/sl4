<em>&gt;&gt; Oh?  If you do that, fewer cows and other meat bearing animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; will be bred and get to live.  So long as their lives come suddenly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and as painlessly as possible to an end, any true animal advocate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be in favor of humans eating them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This implies that just being alive and not how you are alive is all that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't mean to imply that. No, lives not worth living shouldn't be lived.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it's the case that living a full life in natural circumstances (for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your species) and partaking of the social activities and milestones of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life that make for a contented life is what life is all about, and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a thousand lives with these is preferable to millions of lives without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these, then your point does not hold.
</em><br>
<p>But cattle have been bred to be what they are today. It's now
<br>
what's &quot;natural&quot; for them, not that I agree that there is much use
<br>
to the concept &quot;natural&quot;.  The cows I've seen in person and on
<br>
television do appear contented   :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Would you argue that a human advocate should be in favor of aliens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raising a quadrillion human beings in cages is better than the life our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere billions have now?
</em><br>
<p>Probably not, but it would depend. Say we're all going to die in five
<br>
years' time in a supernova or GRB, but this isn't known and we really
<br>
are all going to die. Then it would be far better for that five years to
<br>
be spent in the alien's cages as a quadrillion (instead of an insignificant
<br>
six billion), provided that the sum total of the happiness, joy, comfort,
<br>
satisfaction, and contentment exceeds what we would have otherwise.
<br>
<p>Admittedly, that criterion could mean that many of us, like you and me,
<br>
would suffer a dramatic loss of standard of living and so on. But for
<br>
the human race, yes, it would be better.
