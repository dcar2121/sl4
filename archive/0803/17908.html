<p><em>&gt; Also, it's vital because we can *discuss* whatever is objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You and I may discuss a distant nebula, and refer to it as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing outside our skins, refer to it without any mention of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective impressions.
</em><br>
<p>We can do this because we both learned the same symbols for mapping our
<br>
subjective experiences to the objective world.  When you use the word &quot;red&quot;,
<br>
I understand what you mean because it maps to my own subjective experience
<br>
of red.  Via language acquistion, we've already implicitly agreed on these
<br>
mappings and don't have to renegotiate them each time we utter a statement.
<br>
<p>We can also discuss subjective experience, as evidenced by this thread.  In
<br>
the same way that I cannot directly convey my experience of &quot;red&quot; to you, I
<br>
cannot directly convey my subjective experience of &quot;subjective experience&quot;.
<br>
I rely on the assumption that you experience something similar, and through
<br>
context and clarification you can infer what I'm talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Is my red the same as your red?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>For the purpose of communications, I suppose it doesn't matter.  When you
<br>
say &quot;red&quot;, I know what you're talking about (that is, it consistently
<br>
invokes the same subjective experience), and that's what allows us to
<br>
communicate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It also vastly adds to the difficultiess in discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness and trying to get a handle on it.
</em><br>
<p>True, but we need a better reason than that to dispense with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To think of &quot;the big C&quot; as an objective phenomenon characteristic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some objects/entities---and not characteristic (or only very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marginally characteristic) of others---makes possible scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress towards understanding.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But discussions of the subjective nature of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead utterly nowhere.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From an armchair philosophy standpoint, that might be true.  While this
</em><br>
issue may not be resolvable by our meat-brains, I propose that it's relevant
<br>
with regards to Friendly AI.  In fact, it could even be a key element of
<br>
friendliness.
<br>
<p>Certainly, it's possible (in principle) that our mental constructs could be
<br>
simulated to the extent they are objectively indistinguishable from the
<br>
originals, while at the same time eliminating the most important part of
<br>
subjective experience.  (I.e., turning people into zombies).  We may
<br>
disagree on the likelihood of this, but no one can conclusively rule out the
<br>
possibility.  Similarly, one might argue, we can't rule out the possibility
<br>
of gremlins or invisible elephants in the middle of the room, but there's an
<br>
important difference in these arguments.
<br>
<p>We have to find a reasonable balance between risks and consequences.  If the
<br>
AI is wrong about the existence of gremlins or invisible elephants in the
<br>
middle of the room, well, so what...  However, if it's wrong about
<br>
subjective experience and suddenly all of the lights in the universe go out,
<br>
replaced by highly detailed but dark simulations of lights, what a horrible
<br>
shame that would be.  The risk is so unimaginably great that it's worth
<br>
serious consideration, even if we believe it to be unlikely.
<br>
<p>While I wouldn't want to stubbornly refuse new technologies, such as
<br>
teleportation, radical brain-tissue replacement, or even &quot;uploading&quot;, which
<br>
could improve or extend human life, I also don't want to vanish into
<br>
oblivion while some doppelganger runs around claiming to be me.  For me,
<br>
this is a real concern and the jury is still out.
<br>
