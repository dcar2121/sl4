<em>&gt;  implements Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;Sc-&gt;...-&gt;Sj on Monday and some other
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (Or last month, it doesn't really matter.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Sj is not the same state as Sm, and I got to talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  them as if they were the same state.  Sorry.
</em><br>
<p>If the second computer entered by chance into the state Sj, and then
<br>
the rest of the states Sj-&gt;Sm-&gt;Sn etc. followed, would that avoid the
<br>
interruption in consciousness? It doesn't seem fair to say that it
<br>
would, since there is no more causal connection between the two
<br>
computers in one case than in the other. It would open the way to
<br>
saying that while a set of disconnected single states cannot implement
<br>
a computation, a set of disconnected pairs of states can.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I mean to say that the entire run (on some yet entirely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  computer) that goes Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;Sc-&gt;...-&gt;Sm-&gt;Sn-&gt;...-&gt;Sz,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (where it is important to stipulate that Sm follows Sj causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  even though a few letters of the alphabet have been left out),
</em><br>
<p>yes, I made the letters non-consecutive to indicate that the first
<br>
state of the Tuesday computer could not be easily deduced or looked
<br>
up, although I see it was probably a needless complication
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  will or will not be exactly the same thing depending on how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the Sm state really arose.  If it arose by chance---i.e. no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  causal connection, no information flow from Sj---then there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is an iota of consciousness missing from any Monday/Tuesday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  run that suffered this tiny causal interruption.
</em><br>
<p>I still haven't understood your position on information flow over a
<br>
noisy or unreliable channel. If two pieces of information are
<br>
transferred, and it is known that one is correct and the other not, is
<br>
there an interruption in consciousness if the correct information is
<br>
used?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; Touche.  All right, then suppose I have a choice between (a) somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  magically removing from the universe---and causing to entirely cease to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  exist---a 400 kilogram of Stathis, or blowing your present biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  incarnation to smithereens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Well, this will no doubt make it seem even more absurd to you but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; removing the rock from the universe won't make any difference either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; This is because if an amount of matter can map onto any computation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; then a smaller amount of matter can map onto the same computation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; multiple parallel processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then why would it matter if your biological instance were removed?
</em><br>
<p>Because that would mean my simulation stops (or its measure decreases
<br>
- I don't believe my simulation can stop absolutely unless it could
<br>
somehow be shown logically impossible to derive computations that have
<br>
my present mental state in their subjective past), whereas removing
<br>
the rock does not affect me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; In the ultimate extrapolation of this idea a simulation of the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; universe maps onto the null state. This would mean that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; separate physical reality, but what we think of as physical reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; is a simulation on the big Universal Machine in Platonia. Thus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; physical reality is put on the same ontological basis as the natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I know. Like Tegmark's Level Four.  Like Greg Egan's &quot;Theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of Dust&quot; which, by the way, I had to infer from an interview he gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that he does by no means entirely endorse that view (or any particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  view he so cleverly and superbly explicates in his novels).
</em><br>
<p>Do you have a reference to that interview?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; Well, I'm sure you don't weigh 400kg, so let's say that you weigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  100kg. In comparison to the biological 100kg Stathis, how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &quot;computation of Stathis&quot;, if I may ask, does a 100kg marble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  statue of you emulate?  Or, in other words, right now your 100kg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  because it's ordinary matter at about 295 degrees Kelvin, already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  emulates you to some degree.  What degree?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; There isn't a separate physical me. The physical me is a simulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do prefer &quot;emulation&quot; in this context since a very good actor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or a superhuman AI puppet master could just be pulling your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  strings, and there isn't any real feeling and thinking Stathis at all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  but only some inhuman God-like creature having a bit of fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Or a skillful enough actor, I suppose, who somehow does an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  incredibly good Stathis impersonation, while the real Stathis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  was executed in December.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Emulation&quot; implies that there is some gold standard - physical
<br>
reality - against which the simulation is to be measured. But if the
<br>
whole shebang is a simulation anyway, I'm not sure what the status of
<br>
an emulation is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; and blowing up the physical me means the computations in Platonia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; underpinning me come to an end; whereas blowing up a statue of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; does not affect the computations relating to my consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't quite understand this point. Aren't you being emulated by rocks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or maybe large rocks also?  Aren't you being emulated by some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  patches of dust between the galaxies?  Since you're being emulated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  so many many places (assume for a moment our Level One universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is infinite like Tegmark says), surely the demise of a little bit of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in Australia (whether it's removed altogether from the universe, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  raised to 451 degrees Fahrenheit) can't make a difference, can it?
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm not being emulated by rocks, rocks and I are both being
<br>
emulated in Platonia. That I appear to conscious due to brain activity
<br>
is due to the fact that the computations which gives rise to a
<br>
universe in which stars and planets form and life evolves have much
<br>
higher measure than the computations where I just pop into existence
<br>
out of nowhere as a disembodied consciousness.
