</em><br>
<p><p>This is essentially circular reasoning.  DARPA et al have shown no  
<br>
capacity whatsoever to discriminate between research that is  
<br>
&quot;manifestly on the right track to AI&quot; and the thousands of dead ends  
<br>
out there.  To put it another way, if they *were* capable of making  
<br>
meaningful discriminations, they would already know how to build AI  
<br>
and they would not need your work.
<br>
<p>In short, it will not be manifestly obvious that you are on the right  
<br>
track until you unambiguously produce AI.
