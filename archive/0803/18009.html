<p><em>&gt; The point being that merging two separate incidents or separate

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>I doubt that it will be so difficult.  Once you have uploaded the first set
<br>
of memories, the second should cram in with a bit of cleverness.  After
<br>
that, the 3-N are a matter of rinse &amp; repeat.  Sure it might take a
<br>
redesign/upgrade of memory pointers - but you were already suggesting that
<br>
by supposing the movie and bookstore were indeterminately ordered.  I have
<br>
had superpositions of memories that have and have not (yet) happened.  I
<br>
have commented on &quot;dreams&quot; that I had, then (sometimes months) later
<br>
actually experienced what I dreamed.  Is this a defect of memory or
<br>
point-in-time awareness?  What if I told someone about the dream when I woke
<br>
up or wrote the details in a journal?  Can a second party (or journal)
<br>
corroborate the premonition/deja-vu - or, like the observer examining
<br>
Schroedinger's cat, do they become entangled with the perception of
<br>
memory/pre-cognition?
<br>
<p>Suppose I had experience military combat training in an altered state but do
<br>
not consciously recall this training until a life-threatening situation
<br>
presents itself.  Did I 'merge' this experience into myself just-in-time, or
<br>
was it lying dormant in an unconscious memory?  How do I recall the
<br>
knowledge used to answer game-show questions between the time they are asked
<br>
and the time the contestant answers them?  Is there some retrieval of
<br>
knowledge that I casually encountered at some arbitrary point in the past,
<br>
or a pre-cognitive examination of the impending answer?  I don't (often)
<br>
think about it.
