</em><br>
<p>I haven't been on this list that long, so I won't presume to tell
<br>
anyone what they should or shouldn't talk about on SL4.  But I would
<br>
argue that if you're interested in building a machine that can pass
<br>
the Turing test, consciousness is irrelevant.  And by that I mean...
<br>
consciousness is a word that different people apply to different
<br>
things, just like &quot;gross&quot; is a word that different people apply to
<br>
different things.  I mostly see it as an &quot;intentional stance&quot; (as
<br>
Dennett would say) you can adopt towards complex things.  And when
<br>
superhuman intelligence arises, it will likely unleash the full fury
<br>
of the singularity whether or not any unmodified humans agree that the
<br>
posthumans are &quot;conscious&quot;.  So in that sense, it is irrelevant for
<br>
discussions about the technological singularity.  I would suggest
<br>
talking more about things like intelligence and machine learning.
<br>
<p>I do agree that it's interesting from a philosophical standpoint to
<br>
ask what is meant by the word consciousness.  And maybe you're asking
<br>
me what types of things should we think about to get more of an
<br>
intuition for that?  I don't know... maybe more neuroscience or
<br>
psychology experiments?
