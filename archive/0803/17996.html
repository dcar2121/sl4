<em>&gt;&gt;    You would *not* say to yourself, &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not Slawek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    anymore.  I must be someone else.&quot;  No.  You would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    &quot;WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    just *happened*?  AND WHAT AM I, SLAWEK, doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    here? and why is everything blurry when I look across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    room?  Whose body is this?  It's not *mine*!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   I think that it's a *fact* that you would speak and think just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   that.  You would then, surely, be forced to admit that you went
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   with your memories when they were transferred to California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, this person in California would definitely &quot;feel like Slawek&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but why should &quot;someone who feels like X&quot; imply &quot;someone is X&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Because he accumulates additional experience just as the original
<br>
Slawek did.  Consider:  after you've been an hour in California
<br>
getting used to Lee's body and Lee's circumstances, then we
<br>
transfer your memories to Stuart's body in Vienna for that period
<br>
of time. (Yes... please!  I know I'm assuming that &quot;you&quot; are being
<br>
transferred, but hear me out.)
<br>
<p>When it's all over, and you're back in Slawek's own house in
<br>
the old familiar body, you would have no doubt that you had
<br>
traveled to California and then to Vienna.
<br>
<p>Now if you want to say, &quot;Oh, well, that wasn't me in California,
<br>
it was someone else&quot;, then answer me this: if you weren't in
<br>
California during that hour, where were you while all this happened?
<br>
<p>Lee
