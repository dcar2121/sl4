<p>
<em>&gt;&gt; Sorry Lee, but this is not the *kind* of answer I'm looking for. All the answers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I've received so far from you and other people already assume that memories are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; important whereas the original question is still why are memories important in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the first place, and not just to survival, but why are they so important, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; period.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; What in the world does that mean?  How can something be important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the abstract without being important to someone, or for something?
</em><br>
<p>Ok, then why are memories important [to people] in the first place? The explanation 
<br>
I'm looking for cannot:
<br>
1) assume memories are important [to people]
<br>
2) mention concept of &quot;survival&quot;
<br>
Can you do that?
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; And *survival* is what is important in these arguments.  You do wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to survive, I take it, and you can readily understand why survival is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so important for people.  But maybe survival isn't important to you,
</em><br>
<p>It is, but my point is that I don't agree with your definition of survival. To me 
<br>
and others like me, what you refer to as &quot;survival&quot; isn't survival.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You see, my &quot;I&quot; is not attached to any type of personal memories.
</em><br>
Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Er, sorry, can't resist.  So you *are* attached to your atoms!  Was JC right?
</em><br>
<p>And there was a reason why I told you to leave it alone. :-) It's precisely the 
<br>
above. No, I'm equally unattached to &quot;my atoms&quot; (whatever that means) as I am 
<br>
unattached to my personal memories (hopefully, you'll see this). There *are* other 
<br>
things I can be attached to, you know. I'm only in the process of trying to make 
<br>
you see what it is. You might still disagree if it's the correct thing to be 
<br>
attached to, but at least you'll know what it is. Don't try to guess what it is 
<br>
just yet. :-) And if you start quoting JKC, we might as well go home now. :-) As 
<br>
usual, he was just guessing. Please don't guess.
<br>
<p>Back to the main question about importance of memories [to people]. See if this 
<br>
dilemma clarifies anything. If you had to choose between 2 options, which one would 
<br>
you prefer?
<br>
<p>Option 1) In 1 minute you will go into an eternal coma. On the bright side, you are 
<br>
guaranteed that your brain, and thus your memories, will remain exactly the way 
<br>
they are now until the end of Universe.
<br>
Option 2) In 1 minute all your personal memories will be completely erased from 
<br>
your brain, but, other than that, this brain will function just like any other 
<br>
healthy brain that's able to form and retain new personal memories and remember all 
<br>
the general knowledge acquired throughout the brain's life, like being able to 
<br>
speak, read and write English, do math, etc. However, this brain will not remember 
<br>
its name, its opinions, its family and friends, its tastes, where it's located, 
<br>
none of that personal stuff.
