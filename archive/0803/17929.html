</em><br>
<p>Right.  As regards *anticipation*, not yet.  I should dig up my old
<br>
essay &quot;The Anticipation Paradox&quot; and post it.  The bottom line
<br>
is that there are TEs in which you have to look forward (or
<br>
&quot;anticipate&quot;) something that already happened to you.(!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for merging, I don't understand what is meant.  It doesn't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like a very coherent idea.  The whole idea of a &quot;person&quot; is that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have some sequence of memories.
</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed!  You are quite right to be skeptical of what it even
<br>
*means* at all. Permit me to tell a story that expresses my views
<br>
on the matter.
<br>
<p><p>Suppose that last month you went to a movie and you also went
<br>
to a certain bookstore---but you don't remember which happened
<br>
first. That happens to us all the time. Now let me further tell a tall
<br>
tale about what *really* happened to you last month.
<br>
<p>As you were driving down the freeway, in the evening of a dark
<br>
December night, very tired after a day's work, we made a duplicate
<br>
of you and your car---only the copy was one minute retarded in
<br>
time, but at the same point on the freeway (perhaps to the
<br>
momentary consternation of a few drivers who saw a car appear
<br>
out of nowhere). To the copy, who conveniently blinked, or looked
<br>
down at his iPod at this exact time, maybe it did seem that positions
<br>
of the other cars on the freeway jumped. But he just blinked again,
<br>
and thought nothing more about it, seeing this as yet another sign
<br>
of his extreme weariness.
<br>
<p>That is, the copy was following his original self by about sixty 
<br>
seconds barreling down the freeway.
<br>
<p>Say further that the retarded copy soon saw a bus advertising
<br>
a certain movie, and on impulse pulled off the freeway to a
<br>
movie theater that you frequent. Later, this copy drives the
<br>
rest of the way home, where his duplicate, the original is
<br>
already there!  However, just before the copy gets to the
<br>
garage, the original's car is teleported away by us. He pulls
<br>
into the garage, thinking nothing amiss.
<br>
<p>The copy then enters the house as usual---no alarms at this
<br>
place to deactivate. The original is downstairs and is going to
<br>
bed. We now teleport the duplicate to an exactly identical
<br>
house far away where he soon goes to bed also, and gets a
<br>
good night's sleep. Soon both the original and the duplicate
<br>
are in a very very deep sleep (perhaps with a little chemical
<br>
help by us).
<br>
<p><p>Now comes the hard part. While they are sleeping, the memories
<br>
of having turned off the freeway and gone to the movie are copied
<br>
from the duplicate, and &quot;added&quot; to the memory of the sleeping
<br>
original, and then we dispose of the duplicate, who needs play no
<br>
further role in this tale.  Suddenly, at 5am a terrible, terrible
<br>
earthquake rocks the original out of bed, and he fights for his
<br>
life over the next hours amid his collapsing building, the city-wide
<br>
fire, and his own injuries.  He doesn't think about either having
<br>
visited the bookstore or having seen the movie. After being in
<br>
the hospital, sedated for days and days, he is then kept very
<br>
busy during the following month by all the problems that have
<br>
come up, and doesn't think about either the movie or the bookstore
<br>
visit until many weeks later.  When he does, all he really can
<br>
remember is that yes, he did go to a movie on one of those nights
<br>
last month, and yes, he did go to the bookstore sometime last
<br>
month. But he's forgotten which came first.
<br>
<p>I claim that all of the foregoing is in principle conceivable, and
<br>
poses no psychological difficulty. The memories of two extremely
<br>
similar &quot;instances&quot; were merged, and when he's confronted with
<br>
all the facts, the original recalls that yes, he was in two places at
<br>
the same time.
<br>
<p><p>Note how totally and completely different (and impossible so far
<br>
as I know) for memory merging to plausibly take place between
<br>
two actually different people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If you tried to merge people with two different sets of memories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what would that mean?  It couldn't result in a another person,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because people have sequential memories (you can't remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two different things happening).
</em><br>
<p>You can remember two different things happening at the same 
<br>
time as in my story, without being aware that a trick has been
<br>
played. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It might be possible to construct some more general type of sentience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that &quot;remembers&quot; multiple branches but I have no idea how that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work or if it would be possible...
</em><br>
<p>It's *very* problematic, to say the least.  Yes, I agree.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but clearly this thing you created would be very different than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human, and it may or may not be appropriate to even call it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type of consciousness.  But even if it were possible, how it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work would probably depend a lot on the implementation, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would probably require new ways of speaking about identity (if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity even makes sense for such a creature).  But it doesn't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that relevant to the main question here, which is what should you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipate when you are being copied... a question whose answer seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty clear.
