<p>
Stathis writes up an exquisite Thought Experiment that applies both
<br>
the answer to Eliezer's puzzle and tests the adequacy of the value-
<br>
additivity principle over instantiations (which I endorse).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - If 1000 copies of you are made in London lacking 50% of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories and 10 copies are made in Paris lacking 5% of your memories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are you more likely to find yourself waking up in London or Paris?
</em><br>
<p>I do object to the phrasing (though I know what you mean, and it's
<br>
coherent and the idea is praiseworthy).  The fact is that you wake
<br>
up in both those places, but in different measure. But yes, subjective
<br>
probability forces itself on us---and so far I haven't seen any reason
<br>
that a consistent theory can't be arrived at.  Anticipation is another
<br>
matter entirely. I've given up now for over 20 years believing that a
<br>
completely consistent account of anticipation can be formulated.
<br>
<p>My answer: while being in both places, you'll have more experiences
<br>
in London. Hence the &quot;subjective probability&quot;, according to Bayes'
<br>
Formula, letting Y = You and L = London, 
<br>
<p>P(L|Y)  =  ( P(Y|L) * P(L) ) / P(Y) = (500/1000 * 1000/1010) / (500.5/1010)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=  (1/2) * (1000/1010) / ((500 + 9.5)/1010))
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=  (1/2) * 1000 / 509.5   =  1000 / 1019  =  approximately .98
<br>
<p>So your &quot;subjective probability of being in London&quot;, i.e., the proportion
<br>
of your runtime in London, is about 49/50.  (Whew! I certainly can't do
<br>
that stuff like in the old days.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - You are offered two choices:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paris. The Paris copy is tortured while the London copies are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paris. After an hour, the 100 copies in London are tortured while the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy in Paris is duplicated 100,000 times and none of these copies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is your subjective probability of being tortured at the moment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original copying greater in (a) or (b)?
</em><br>
<p>It's greater in (a), because the fraction of your runtime in the multiverse
<br>
where you're being tortured is smaller. (By the same logic used to solve
<br>
Eliezer's puzzle.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Note that there is no problem *objectively* describing what happens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of these cases. Lee tries to take the objective point of view and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translate it into the subjective point of view as well. But to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would require a complete overthrow of our notions of anticipation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective probability, and I don't think this is possible without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewiring our brains.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;Anticipation Dilemma&quot;, as I call it, really isn't connected to subjective
<br>
probability.  It arises from having to, gasp(!), look forward to things that
<br>
have already happened to you, i.e., &quot;anticipate&quot; what you did (and remember)
<br>
doing yesterday.  That's where I gave up on a rational basis for &quot;anticipation&quot;,
<br>
i.e. relishing or dreading future experiences.
<br>
<p>Lee
