<em>&gt; &gt; The fact is that experience doesn't exist.  Of course you will disagree. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So will the robot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Experience doesn't exist&quot;?  You mean to say that you don't have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience right now of sitting in front of a monitor?  That you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the experience of reading an email or watching TV?  You mean to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that the experience of skiing down a slope doesn't exist?  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are using the word in a way that I've never heard before. 
</em><br>
<p>Of course I believe in my own experience or qualia.  But there is a difference
<br>
between believing something exists and it actually existing.  You can't prove
<br>
that anything exists.  I can't make any argument that a robot couldn't make.  
<br>
<p>When I suppress my evolutionarily programmed beliefs and analyze the question
<br>
logically I have to conclude that either a robot experiences or I don't.  But
<br>
in the common sense meaning of the word, humans experience and machines don't.
<br>
&nbsp;But do animals?  Embryos?  Terminally ill Alzheimer's patients?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether a robot has an experience depends on its complexity.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can safely say that the very nice robots the Japanese have recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; built have no experiences, any more than a car has experiences. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Granted, at some level, it may be argued that everything has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences, but those of ants, viruses, and stones are infinitesimally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rudimentary.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eventually robots could have &quot;inner lives&quot; as complex as ours or more,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when one day they have enough intelligence/consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>How do you measure complexity?  How many bits are required for consciousness?
<br>
<p>A program like autobliss ( <a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt">http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt</a> )
<br>
simulates reinforcement learning.  Would it be moral to run a version of the
<br>
program capable of learning more complex functions?  Suppose I add episodic
<br>
memory, i.e. it can recall the training sequence?  Where do you draw the line?
<br>
&nbsp;And note that I can teach it the exact same function using only reward or
<br>
only punishment.  Does it make any difference?
