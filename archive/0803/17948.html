</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  So what is it that has kept me &quot;me&quot;?  I say it's memories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say that memories are a necessary but not sufficient condition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep you &quot;you&quot;  If a [perhaps role-playing] guard had been a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicate of one of the prisoners, their memories would have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtually identical; and yet, to all extent and purposes, they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same person.
</em><br>
<p>But what about different moods?  Do people who are really
<br>
grouchy or really bitchy for a few hours, and then become
<br>
as nice as they can possibly be, actually go from being one
<br>
person to another?  Yes, there is the phrase &quot;you don't
<br>
seem like yourself today.&quot;  But I don't think anyone is taking
<br>
that at all literally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it's not so much &quot;duplicates are different people&quot; that I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking at. I'm more arguing that if your actual life was similar to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicate experience (that nothing that you accumulated was permanent;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no friend can be relied on; that your crimes have little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences; that stability is forever beyond your grasp)
</em><br>
<p>That is a very odd sort of duplicate experiment. If your brother
<br>
got very down on his luck, or found himself struggling for survival
<br>
in a jungle somewhere, no matter how &quot;different a person&quot; (according
<br>
to you) that he had become, he'd snap back to normal as soon as
<br>
circumstances changed back.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  You would *not* say to yourself, &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not Stuart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  anymore.  I must be someone else.&quot;  No.  You would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME?  And what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  am I, Stuart, doing here? and why is everything blurry when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  look across the room?  Whose body is this?  It's not *mine*!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course. But how would I feel after a few days, a week, a month, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year? What if I woke up female? Or in jail?
</em><br>
<p>You're right, I think. Now, how long would life in the Army (helping
<br>
out in some violent area of the world today where the soldiers have
<br>
to work very hard under brutal conditions) take to make you into
<br>
someone that your relatives and friends would say &quot;This is no longer
<br>
Stuart&quot;?  To me, the answer would be years.   The first few days
<br>
would be just like a vacation that had gone badly awry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not arguing any coherent position here, just that memories are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the end all of who you are (just think of hormones, for example).
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Well, for now, we might be at an impasse (though let's not
<br>
give up). Drugs could induce me to behave very differently (e.g.
<br>
alcohol or PCP.  But so long as no *damage* was done, I'd
<br>
always be ready to snap back.  Normally we do not consider
<br>
alcoholics, for example, to be different people than they were.
<br>
Not literally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A lot of my memories are external to myself - stored in pictures,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers, environments, and relationships. Deprived of these,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would not think of myself as the same person.
</em><br>
<p>Good arguments. I hope we hear from others. I'll have to think
<br>
about it more.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This post had some kind of point to it, honest, before it became all meandery.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, not at all :-)    You brought up a lot of good stuff IMO, thanks.
<br>
I need to be criticized on this point of 99% of us being our memories.
<br>
<p>Lee
