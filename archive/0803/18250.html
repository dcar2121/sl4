<em>&gt;&gt; Does S(n+1) have to be generated by P from S(n) or is the raw fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that S(n) and S(n+1) simply occur sufficient to generate subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; continuity? Lee would argue that the causal link is important, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; say that the moments of consciousness order themselves due to a rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; such as you describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the model, continuity depends only on the algorithmic similarity of S(n)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and S(n+1).  In practice, this would require some communication between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What if each S has to be implemented on real hardware in a finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; single world cosmology? I don't see how you could fit in more states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by making the difference between them smaller and smaller, since at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some point there will be no subjective difference between one state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and the next.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The model assumes that the set of states is isomorphic to N.  Any real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implementation with finite memory must have finite subjective experience.
</em><br>
<p>It sounds as though you are insisting on a real implementation, that is,
<br>
an actual physical process consisting of causally linked states, say
<br>
with the causation defined by the Rules of Conway's Life or by
<br>
physics, or whatever.  I'm not asking you to take sides in my debate
<br>
with Stathis, just trying to understand.
<br>
<p>That is, if we try to argue that your model is an accurate description.
<br>
<p>I also would note that some of the preceding posts in this thread might
<br>
be read as saying that a GLUT is conscious.  I don't think that one can
<br>
be, as I've made clear in another thread, mainly because it easily reduces
<br>
(in my opinion) to timeless patterns, e.g., like clouds of dust scattered
<br>
over lightyears in space, or patterns that can be discerned in rocks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All implementations must have finite memory because the universe has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bekenstein bound of about 10^122 bits.
</em><br>
<p>That would be the *visible* universe, of course. If Tipler is right about
<br>
Level One---which I think he is---the actual universe is infinite.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I realize there is a fundamental conflict because the model says that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is immortal but any implementation is mortal.
</em><br>
<p>Well, would you then say that this conflict in your model goes away
<br>
if in your *real implementations* you insist on ordinary causality 
<br>
consisting of orderly information flow between the ordered states
<br>
to characterize them, e.g. some systems obeying laws of physics
<br>
of some form or another?
