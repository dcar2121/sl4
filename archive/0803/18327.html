<p><em>&gt; It seems differentiation is not the example to invoque [invoke] here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the original idea can be adapted, as follows: let us define some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other functional on the set of polynomials, via a GLUT, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximalish Kolmogorov Complexity,
</em><br>
<p>It's this functional, I take it, that has maximalish KC. That is, the
<br>
image of the polynomial P is i(P), and to get from P to i(P) requires
<br>
an extremely non-obvious and highly complex functional &quot;i&quot;. Right
<br>
so far?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; subject to only one rule &quot;R&quot;: it maps polynomials of the nth degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to polynomials of the (n-1)th degree.
</em><br>
<p>R is the original mapping whose analog back in the original problem
<br>
is the succession of causal states that characterize the consciousness
<br>
of some entity. In your earlier, now discarded, case, R happened to
<br>
be differentiation. Now R is some other Rule, which perhaps (I hope)
<br>
is by hypothesis closer to a causal description of what happens between
<br>
two succeeding states in a person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We then hit the set S
</em><br>
<p>where S, I take it, is i({P1, P2, P3, ... for possibly countably many
<br>
terms})? I apologize if I have misunderstood.  Anyway, you are
<br>
hitting the entire set S with a hash function, which I assume has
<br>
the property that f( i{P1, P2, ...}) = f(i(P1), i(P2), ...), right?
<br>
<p>Oh, oh.  I think I've gone astray.  Forget that. I now believe
<br>
that you mean for S to be the original set of polynomials.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with the usual hash function f, and have a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GLUT, called f(GLUT), of pretty much same complexity. The rule about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polynomials is mapped to an equivalent rule f(R) on f(S),
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry.  But I have no conviction left that I have followed correctly.
<br>
Perhaps if you put me on the right track above, I can continue.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with an ordered partition of f(S). The complexity of f(R) depends on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the details of S (in the best case, the rule is vacuous, in the worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case, it is as complicated a f(GLUT) itself). Generally, however, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have much higher KC than R.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, schematically, R is an approximation of GLUT, while f(R) is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation of f(GLUT). However, generically, R will be much simpler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than GLUT, and much simpler than f(R) is vis-a-vis f(GLUT).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is the mathematical statement of the original idea; there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalents when we replace the original GLUT with some object C that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has less Kolmogorov Complexity. If we call C consciousness, and R is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some simple, crude approximation of C, we can't expect that f(R) is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SIMPLE approximation of f(C). Hence my point for distinguishing between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hash-function-equivalent setups.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And ultimately, maybe, between consciousness and an equivalent GLUT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; ...Many thanks. However, the red herring is still, in my view, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; distinction between a GLUT and a hash-equivalent GLUT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I probably don't understand that. You did just get through pointing out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a vital difference between the GLUT in polynomial form, and a GLUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in some hash function equivalent form. So what does the latter mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, me bad and incompetent: &quot;between a rule and a hash equivalent GLUT&quot;.
