<p><em>&gt; Ah.  Here you mean not only the computer science &quot;shared memory&quot;

</em><br>
<p><p>Yes.  Though strained, I don't know what other analogy to use because I am
<br>
assuming the merging of states isn't feasible for discussion unless we're
<br>
talking about uploaded brains.  I guess you could plan for some convoluted
<br>
chemistry and physical manipulation of meat, but that seems too icky for
<br>
discussion.  :)  I expect that the uploaded person will be software running
<br>
on top of some general virtual person hardware.  If so, there will be no
<br>
direct way to experience whether your memories are retrieved through a GLUT
<br>
or somehow recreated on-the-fly from templates (something like
<br>
compression/decompression of a world of context to a few relevant bits that
<br>
can be used to reconstruct a most-likely scenario that we believe to be a
<br>
real memory)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; and a context switch back will appear to those inhabiting the suspended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environment that the results of those independent threads have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computed instantly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not very clear, IMO.  With ordinary raw threads or processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running on a computer, sure, one moment the process has access to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data structures X and Y, and the next, equal access to Z. But that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely ignores the knotty problem of how memories are added to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, as you say &quot;instantly&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><p>what makes &quot;ordinary raw thread&quot; different inside your PC, in a computronium
<br>
Jupiter Brain or the entire detectable universe?  I don't mean this to be a
<br>
rhetorical question.  Given my previous paragraph (this post) - I would like
<br>
you to describe what makes PC threads, their equivalent analogue for the
<br>
software mind running on virtual human hardware and the real-world mechanism
<br>
(whatever it might be)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Normally each new experience you have is immediately compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on some sort of salience measure to everything else that has ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened to you, i.e., to all your other memories. That's why you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are &quot;reminded&quot; of things, some of which happened a long time ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now if you get enough new experiences, the new memories that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are generated are slowly integrated into all your existing ones.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The computer analogy seems a little strained here, at least with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the kinds of algorithms we have today running on our machines.
</em><br>
<p><p>Now I have a greater appreciation for the trouble you see with close copies
<br>
not being close enough to merge.  If the salience measure for two different
<br>
copies were sufficiently far apart that one would find a new fact compatible
<br>
with prior experience enough to learn it while the other was unable to
<br>
accept the new information because it was incompatible with prior
<br>
experience.  In an extreme case we could construct a scenario where the two
<br>
copies were lead to believe completely incompatible beliefs (eg: religious
<br>
conditioning)
<br>
<p>We may need to evolve some method of dealing with this.  My guess would be
<br>
that our normal memory pruning mechanism could be employed to simply
<br>
erase/suppress any incompatibilities.  There is evidence (of varying
<br>
effectiveness) to suggest that sleep facilitates mental housekeeping.  There
<br>
is also evidence of psychological defense mechanisms will artificially
<br>
create memories to block recall of traumatic events.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the reintegration process will involve vetting what experience to
<br>
keep from the copy?  If you spawn a LeeCorbin_EmptyTrash process, it might
<br>
not require the vast knowledgebase of your entire history  (possibly only
<br>
the history of events since the last time it was invoked)  Now this
<br>
task/process believes itself to be be LeeCorbin (so far as you would only
<br>
authorize such process to an implicit trust as yourself)  After this
<br>
sub-self has fulfilled its reason for existing and you have verified
<br>
success, you may choose to reintegrate the complete experiential record of
<br>
that process.  In that case, you should have just done the task directly.
<br>
At the opposite extreme, you don't subsume any of the experience because you
<br>
are confident there is minimal novel experience associated with that task.
<br>
The degree to which you care about the experience is probably related to how
<br>
much of your Self you originally invested in the creation of the
<br>
clone/sub-process.
<br>
<p>I realize this isn't exactly a copy or close duplicate (per the subject
<br>
line) - Would you call a clone that has _only_ the last 2 minutes of
<br>
task-specific knowledge to be a copy?  Would you call it a completely
<br>
different identity?  I think this question comes out of the discussion about
<br>
what makes an identity: the model predicting their behavior, or the memory
<br>
of prior situations?  (tough call because past events are often the raw data
<br>
upon which the model is based)  Is it possible to observe that I choose blue
<br>
rather than red in 100 instances, so you remember only that I prefer blue -
<br>
then delete your memory of the 100 instances and retain only the knowledge
<br>
that I prefer blue?  Upon my next choice will you be able to assess that I
<br>
made a characteristic choice of blue?  Is there any value to incur the
<br>
storage overhead of recording the details of every one of those 100 prior
<br>
instances?  How much memory optimization do we already perform, that we will
<br>
need to be able to do in an uploaded state?  Again, I apologize for the
<br>
strained computer analogy - but I continue to assume the most logical way
<br>
any of these copies exist is after uploading.
