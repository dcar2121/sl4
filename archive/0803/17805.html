<p><em>&gt; Lets say though that somehow, an abstraction of my atomic structure/energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is sufficient for consciousness, that such structure is conscious in and of itself.
</em><br>
<p>(I myself would say that it must get runtime, i.e., be executed on a computer,
<br>
biological, or silicon, or other, in order to be conscious. Frozen data, stored
<br>
somewhere in a warehouse, no matter how detailed, are not conscious.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if we were to create n clones of me, utilizing this abstraction as input
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a program, lets further say that such clones are implemented in a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program, and all are subject to the same internal environment.
</em><br>
<p>Fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lets also say that each clone is housed in a small computer, maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10cm x 10cm x 10cm in size. It's not important.  If we create several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantiations of this program, several of these computers so to speak,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and housed them in the same building. would there only be one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instantiation of consciousness,
</em><br>
<p>No, as causally separate process, each is separately conscious,
<br>
even if isomorphic (according to me).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; given that its the same structure, even though each instantiation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this structure is not causally interactive with any of the others, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are there multiple consciousnesses? 
</em><br>
<p>Let's say that you are being implemented on Earth right now by
<br>
a computer (we live in a local simulation), and there is an identical
<br>
you being emulated *exactly* identically on a computer around
<br>
Proxima Centauri.  These processes are outside each other's
<br>
light cone, and are causally distinct. &quot;You&quot; at Proxima are unaffected
<br>
by, say, the unfortunate demise of &quot;you&quot; on Earth.
