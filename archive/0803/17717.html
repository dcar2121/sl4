</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh, why not?  Perhaps there is a terminological problem here, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the physical system in question, of course the computation yields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (subjective) experience.  What a system is computing is objective,
</em><br>

<p><em>&gt; Why is whether something has experience or not even relevant?
</em><br>
<p>Because all moral questions revolve around the answer! And so unless
<br>
you are a complete nihilist, solipsist, or sociopath, all actions whatsoever
<br>
that affect other sentients depend crucially upon the answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't immediately know if any of you have conscious experience,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you'd pass a turing test if I gave you one. Although that wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell me if you're really conscious, its 'good enough' so to speak. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, you can't *immediately* know if the people living on your
<br>
street have their hearts on the left sides of their bodies, either,
<br>
and for practical reasons you can't and won't go test them all.
<br>
Likewise, it is incredibly reasonable to suppose that such similar
<br>
creatures to you as other humans are also conscious.
<br>
<p>Regards,
