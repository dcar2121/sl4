Dear Lee,
<br>
<p>We got on this point after a long tortuous route: so let's simplify!
<br>
<p>S = a finite set of polynomials.
<br>
G = a GLUT on S.
<br>
R = a rule that says that any polynomial of n-th degree will be
<br>
mapped, under G, to a polynomial of (n-1)-th degree.
<br>
f = a hash function from S (to f(S))
<br>
<p>f(G) = the GLUT on f(S) equivalent to G on S.
<br>
f(R) = the rule on f(S) equivalent to R on S.
<br>
<p>Main point: G has very high KC (as does f(G)), R has low KC, but f(R)
<br>
has high KC.
<br>
<p>Theorem (which will be left as as excercise to the reader - i.e. I
<br>
haven't caluclated it, but it seems obvious):
<br>
<p>KC(f(R)) / KC(f(G)) can be made arbitrarily higher than KC(R) / KC(G) .
<br>
<p><p>Corrolary: We can decrease the KC of G to some extent, and still get
<br>
the inequality above. We want to do this, because we don't want G to
<br>
be a full GLUT but something more &quot;understandable&quot;.
<br>
<p>Inspiration: If we imagine that G is the rules of consciousness, and R
<br>
is some much simpler property of consciousness (say: it learns form
<br>
experience), then R is only much simpler than G in our current
<br>
description of the universe; in hash equivalent settings, R does not
<br>
qualify as being &quot;much simpler&quot;.
<br>
<p>Philosophical consequence: different hash equivalent ways of looking
<br>
at problems are not equivalent. Since we essentially cannot deal with
<br>
hash functions in any computable way, the different ways things are
<br>
set up are very important.
<br>
<p>Punch line: Let E be an explanation of consiousness, (an explanation
<br>
in the sense we are used to). Let F be a GLUT, hash equivalent to E.
<br>
Then though E and F are hash equivalent, they are not equivalent,
<br>
especially from our point of view.
<br>
<p>Hope this helps! I don't know if it's all that useful, though.
<br>
<p>Stuart
