Stuart writes (welcome back!),
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some extra precisions on my long lost example (long lost, since it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened two long weeks ago...)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; The answer, whatever it is, will have simpler,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; quasi answers - incomplete but informative.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; The hash function equivalents will not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; simpler than the hash function equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; to the full question.
</em><br>
<p>Let me make sure that I still remember the context. You are giving
<br>
a nice, precise, elementary model or example of a normally large
<br>
and cumbersome computation carried out by a Giant Look Up Table.
<br>
In other words, your &quot;Polynomial Derivative Model&quot; stipulates
<br>
<p>A.  the analog of a computer or TM's state is a polynomial (over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some field, which we might as well take to be the reals)
<br>
B.  the analog of the computation of the next state is the construction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the polynomial's derivative
<br>
C.  instead of a computation in the ordinary way that polynomials
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are differentiated, it would be in principle possible to store all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the results of say, six billion different polynomial differentiations
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(one for each person on Earth, or if we need to, 10^15 such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each computer or person on the Earth)
<br>
D. the PDM-GLUT operates by computing a very complicated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hash of each polynomial (no infinite polynomials permitted)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which yields the address within the lookup table of the correct
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differentiation (derivative).
<br>
E.  The process can result in a chain of such derivations, which is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the analog to an ordinary computation, and is an interesting
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parallel to a computation that emulates a human consciousness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over some period of time.  Indeed, since a polynomial may be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any length whatsoever---that is, of any degree whatsoever---
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we might even discover an isomorphism between a sequence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of derivatives and human consciousness, though that may be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too much of a stretch at present.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Examples of simpler questions: for the derivative, we have interim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results: the derivative of a monomial is a monomial, the derivative of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a polynomial of n-th degree is a polynomial of n-1 th degree. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are simpler than knowing the full derivative rule, but to list them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the hash function is actually more complicated than listing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GLUT for the derivative itself (as we first have to define the subsets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;monomials&quot; and &quot;polynomial of n-th degree&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite understand, or perhaps it's merely that I don't agree.
<br>
<p>The rules for taking derivatives of polynomials have a relatively
<br>
small Kolmogorov Complexity. Also, giving rules to determine
<br>
the degree of a polynomial has rather low KC. Therefore, it 
<br>
seems to me that what is in the GLUT may have a lot higher
<br>
KC.  For example, if we did have 6x10^6 x 10^15  initial
<br>
polynomials to try, some of which may be of the octillionth
<br>
degree, then clearly the KC of what is stored in the table
<br>
exceeds the KC of all our rules and definitions about polynomial
<br>
differentiation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; 2) The implicit infinity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Implicit in the definition of differentiation is the fact that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; could differentiate any polynomial (with, say, rational coefficients).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; The definition of differentiation to f(S) does not extend to infinity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; in this way; in fact, there is no evident extension of f(S).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  What?  Even if you have infinitely many polynomials, each has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  derivative, the only difference being that there is no &quot;top dog&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Strategically, would it have been better to stick with a crippled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  definition of derivative, oh, something along the lines of either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;we are not going to consider S to be infinite&quot;, or &quot;a qDerivative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is a derivative of a polynomial function, but the domain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  qDerivative is by definition finite&quot;?  Or something like that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The derivative can be defined for any polynomial, and can be defined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a finite (and very short) sentence. A finite definition, generating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an infinite number of relations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes;  okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now try and go the other way; from a GLUT, try and deduce the general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule. If we have the GLUT in polynomial form, the universal rule is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy to deduce; if we have the GLUT in some hash function equivalent,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can't do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I think that the whole infinity digression is a red-herring to your otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  brilliant analysis (and I don't often call what other posters do &quot;brilliant&quot;),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  reserving that appellation strictly to apply to my own missives only.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, at least not easily, and, yes, perhaps not at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...Many thanks. However, the red herring is still, in my view, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction between a GLUT and a hash-equivalent GLUT.
</em><br>
<p>I probably don't understand that. You did just get through pointing out
<br>
a vital difference between the GLUT in polynomial form, and a GLUT
<br>
in some hash function equivalent form. So what does the latter mean?
<br>
