I'll try to keep this minimally political in accordance with list rules. I think it is most realistic and  most cautious to assume that various governments will take an interest in AGI, as proto-AGIs develop. For example, DARPA will often begin long-horizon, low probability projects, based on the small hope that something useful will come out of it. I think that government involvement may be unavoidable from a practical POV. [ I could be wrong, of course, but I figure it's safer to play it conservatively]. From a strategic POV, I think that what we need to do is make the US government an &quot;Allie&quot; of Friendliness. Obviously, we would need to *effectively* convey the importance and ethical responsibility of the Singularity. But there are some aspects of the US gov's structure conducive to this. For example, our advocacy can be concentrated on the next US President - really, only one person needs to be genuinely convinced of the gravity of the situation. Presidential power will
<br>
&nbsp;take care of the other logistics, or at least we can reasonably hope so. Of course, the more US politicians we can convince, the better. I'm not saying that the US government is totally perfect or anything - just that I think this is the &quot;safest&quot; approach.
