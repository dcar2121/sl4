<em>&gt; Sorry for labouring the point (I'd be surprised if anyone other than

</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines + operators can reliably carry out the same computations as a

<em>&gt; single machine. But if the Australian operator simply provides a list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all possible states, knowing but not telling which one is S(n),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seems to me exactly the same as providing no information at all;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. the same as if the Vienna operator knew nothing about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antipodean device and simply tried random states, one of them just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening to be S(n+1). How does this affect whether consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interrupted?
</em><br>
<p>I admit I haven't followed the whole thread.  But if you insist that
<br>
consciousness exists, then you need a plausible mathematical model of it to
<br>
draw any conclusions.  Suppose you model a sequence of mental states S(1),
<br>
S(2), ..., S(n) as strings or natural numbers N such that the information gain
<br>
between successive states, K(S(i+1)|S(i)) is small, but still larger than the
<br>
information loss, K(S(i)|S(i+1)).  An example would be a series of bit strings
<br>
where S(i+1) is formed by appending a random bit to S(i).  In this case,
<br>
K(S(i+1)|S(i)) = 1 &gt; K(S(i)|S(i+1)) = 0.  The inequality defines the direction
<br>
of perceptual time.  Furthermore, K(S(j)|S(i)) quantifies the perceptual
<br>
experience that occurs from time i to time j.  The model is plausible because
<br>
intelligent systems typically gain and lose information this way by evolving
<br>
slowly over time.
<br>
<p>If you accept this model, then it is possible to implement the scenario you
<br>
described by ordering the states S(1) through S(n) using conditional
<br>
algorithmic complexity to deduce the most recent state.  Also, there is no
<br>
perceived interruption of consciousness because what is perceived during the
<br>
transition is described by a small program P that inputs S(n) and outputs
<br>
S(n+1) in a perceived time of |P|, no different than any other step.
<br>
<p>The model has some other interesting implications.  For example, it implies
<br>
the possibility of conscious experience in more than one dimension of time, or
<br>
in a type of time where there is no clear distinction between past and future.
<br>
&nbsp;In our directed one-dimensional model, it implies the existence of birth but
<br>
not death: it is not possible to not have experience because for every state
<br>
S(n) there is an infinite sequence S(n+1), S(n+2) such that each
<br>
K(S(n+i+1)|S(n+i)) is small.  (However, the sequence going back in time is
<br>
finite.)
<br>
<p>Although you can perceive the death of others, you cannot perceive your own
<br>
death.  The model implies a multiverse because for each state S(i) in N there
<br>
are many states S(j) such that K(S(j)|S(i)) is small.  For every universe
<br>
where you die at time t there is another where you don't, and you continue to
<br>
experience in that other universe.
<br>
<p>Finally, the model implies that you have conscious experience because N
<br>
exists.
