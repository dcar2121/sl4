<p>Yes, it's an obvious point. But the idea that any computation can be
<br>
implemented by any system is just the starting point. From this it
<br>
follows that every computation is implemented necessarily by virtue of
<br>
its status as a Platonic object (consciousness is a property of the
<br>
abstract computation just as squareness is a property of the abstract
<br>
square), and then the problem becomes one of defining a measure to
<br>
explain why out of all these computations we experience the orderly
<br>
world that we do. Suggestions have been made as to how the measure of
<br>
a computation might be proportional to the length of the program
<br>
producing it - eg. see this post from the Everything list in which Hal
<br>
Finney and others (including you) discuss this question:
<br>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_thread/thread/c56e49173ab9070c/210afd125ae346dc?lnk=gst&amp;q=tegmark">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/browse_thread/thread/c56e49173ab9070c/210afd125ae346dc?lnk=gst&amp;q=tegmark</a><br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; and (b) that it doesn't result in information flow between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the states. But I don't think it's obviously absurd, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; see the lack of information flow (or inability to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; counterfactuals) as just making it impossible for us as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; external observers to use the system for computation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you explain a bit more to me about this?  Between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  perhaps not using &quot;counter-factual&quot; correctly, or whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it makes a fig of difference about &quot;external observers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (it doesn't), I'm not sure I'm following you.  Perhaps an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  example distinct from the Monday/Tuesday one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  help me.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you to an extent about the significance of causality in
<br>
computation. Suppose there are steps in a computation which don't
<br>
follow from the preceding step, but just happen to occur correctly *as
<br>
if* they followed from the preceding step.
<br>
<p>For example, imagine a machine M1 into which you input &quot;6*7&quot;, gears
<br>
and levers and so forth go clickety-clack, and after 100 steps it
<br>
outputs &quot;42&quot;. Next, consider another identical machine, M2, into which
<br>
you input &quot;6*7&quot;, but at the 73rd step you destroy it. The next day on
<br>
the other side of the world, by fantastic coincidence, someone else
<br>
builds a machine, M3, which just happens to be in identical
<br>
configuration to M1 (and hence M2, had it not been destroyed) at the
<br>
73rd step. M3 then goes clickety-clack through steps 74 to 100 and
<br>
outputs &quot;42&quot;.
<br>
<p>I would agree with you that even though the activity of M2/M3 seen in
<br>
combination might look the same as the activity of M1, they are not
<br>
equivalent computational systems. This is because M1 would
<br>
appropriately handle a counterfactual, but M2/M3 would not: if the
<br>
input to M1 had been &quot;4*5&quot; the output would have been &quot;20&quot;, whereas if
<br>
the input to M2 had been &quot;4*5&quot; the output from M3 would have still
<br>
been &quot;42&quot;, as the lack of a causal link between M2 and M3 means there
<br>
is no way for the input of M2 to influence the output of M3. The
<br>
obvious significance of this is that M2/M3 is useless as a
<br>
computational device. It could be made useful by introducing reliable
<br>
information transfer between the two machines, say by an operator
<br>
passing M2's final state to be used as M3's initial state. The new
<br>
M2/M3 system is then equivalent to the intact M1, albeit a bit slower
<br>
and more cumbersome.
<br>
<p>Now, let's suppose that implementation of the computation 6*7 = 42 is
<br>
associated with a primitive moment of consciousness, and for
<br>
simplicity that this is the case only if the computation is
<br>
implemented in full. We would then both agree that M1 and M2/M3 with
<br>
reliable information transfer would give rise to consciousness. You
<br>
would argue that M2/M3 without reliable information transfer would not
<br>
give rise to consciousness. But what if the information transfer
<br>
doesn't fall into the all or none category? For example, what if the
<br>
operator transfers the right information some of the time based on
<br>
whim, but never reveals to anyone what he decides? The M2/M3 system
<br>
(plus operator) would again be useless as a computation device to an
<br>
external observer, but on some runs, known only to the operator, there
<br>
will definitely be a causal link. Does consciousness occur on those
<br>
runs or not? Does it make a difference if the operator lies 99.999% of
<br>
the time or 0.001% of the time? Does the computation know when he's
<br>
lying, or does it know the proportion of time he intends to lie so
<br>
that it can experience fractional consciousness at the appropriate
<br>
level?
<br>
<p>You will have a hard time defining criteria (let alone a mechanism)
<br>
whereby a computation &quot;knows&quot; that there is a causal link. It is
<br>
simpler to assume that consciousness occurs purely as a result of the
<br>
right physical states being implemented, while the presence of a
<br>
recognisable causal link only determines whether the system can be
<br>
used by an external observer for useful computation.
