</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You may remove the disputed clause .. or you may not.  I prefer to remain
<br>
non-committal regarding your insistance to declare my action UnFriendly
<br>
conditional on my next declaration.  I have not waited very long at all to
<br>
reply, but feel that your repeated insistence may be construed as
<br>
UnFriendly-ism - though perhaps not by me or those local members of our
<br>
Friendly Society, but to a majority of the more Conservatively Friendly
<br>
Citizens who are implicitly assumed by their nature to be Anonymously
<br>
Friendly.
<br>
<p>I believe I may further accept your definition of Friendly at considerable
<br>
expense to all other relevant terms used in your declaration, such as;
<br>
(un)Reasonable, Immediately, Insist, and Fairly Short Period.  I will,
<br>
however, grant that your positive reception of my previous post in this
<br>
thread is indicative that you are a Nice Guy.  :)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Thank you *VERY* much.  I enjoyed this!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed: If nothing else, this self-referential meta-formalism is an amusing
<br>
use of language.

<em>&gt; &gt; The Friendliness Declaration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hi, I'm Mark Waser.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am hereby declaring myself to be a Friendly entity as of March 12,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2008.  I have not knowingly/intentionally performed any UnFriendly actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; since this date.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I have not previously been declared UnFriendly by any declared Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entity.    I have not been requested to put any disputed actions or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unintentional UnFriendly actions in this declaration by any declared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Friendly entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am Mike.  I declare myself to be Friendly.  (Yes, that's a completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambiguous term, but I know it means when I declare it)  I deem Mark Waser's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declaration of Friendly to be hostile to my own definition of Friendly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefor declare him to be UnFriendly.  (again, I'm not sure what exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mark means by his use of the term or the significance of camelCase used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereupon)  I hereby request a dispute resolution clause be added to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mark's declaration of March 12, 2008 and further declare that the now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defunct declaration no longer be declared.
</em><br>
