</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it comes back to the same thing. I know I'm in a minority,
</em><br>
<p>But you have very good company, e.g., Hal Finney and many others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I don't see a problem with assuming that consciousness can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happen with a succession of frozen states. The two reasons you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give in your article for rejecting a conscious SFS are (a) that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously absurd,
</em><br>
<p>Well, er, yes.  Not much of a reason on the face of it :-)
<br>
But isn't it true that if you follow Putnam in his &quot;Representation
<br>
and Reality&quot; (extremely un-recommended by yours truly),
<br>
then you must suppose that any given rock performs the
<br>
calculations making up Stathis just as well as your organic
<br>
body does?   In other words, if I have a choice of using
<br>
the Tsar Bomba (50 megatons) on the rock or on your
<br>
own person, if you come to visit me, then why do you care
<br>
whether I totally destroy the rock or totally destroy
<br>
Stathis's everyday human person?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and (b) that it doesn't result in information flow between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the states. But I don't think it's obviously absurd, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see the lack of information flow (or inability to handle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counterfactuals) as just making it impossible for us as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external observers to use the system for computation.
</em><br>
<p>Could you explain a bit more to me about this?  Between
<br>
perhaps not using &quot;counter-factual&quot; correctly, or whether
<br>
it makes a fig of difference about &quot;external observers&quot; 
<br>
(it doesn't), I'm not sure I'm following you.  Perhaps an
<br>
example distinct from the Monday/Tuesday one would
<br>
help me.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
