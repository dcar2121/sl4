<em>&gt; Depends on your personality.  If I was duplicated 10 times, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would be a lot of coin flipping, and the end result would likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  2 or 3 copies of me that shared my current life in various ways, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or two that went off to do something entirely different, and a bunch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of suicides.  Since we all have the same set of things we want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  do, and there aren't 10 paths, it doesn't really matter which one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  does what; differentiation will occur later.
</em><br>
<p>Ten copies would not be enough to exhaust the possible different paths
<br>
I would want to take :-) but I understand your point. It does
<br>
critically depend on your personality and social connections; a
<br>
homeless wanderer with no friends, family or cirminal record would
<br>
find the duplications perfect.
<br>
<p>I'll explain more of the idea in my next email.
<br>
<p>Stuart
