<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Does S(n+1) have to be generated by P from S(n) or is the raw fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; that S(n) and S(n+1) simply occur sufficient to generate subjective

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; say that the moments of consciousness order themselves due to a rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; such as you describe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the model, continuity depends only on the algorithmic similarity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S(n)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and S(n+1).  In practice, this would require some communication between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; two processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; What if each S has to be implemented on real hardware in a finite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; single world cosmology? I don't see how you could fit in more states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; by making the difference between them smaller and smaller, since at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; some point there will be no subjective difference between one state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; and the next.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The model assumes that the set of states is isomorphic to N.  Any real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implementation with finite memory must have finite subjective experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It sounds as though you are insisting on a real implementation, that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an actual physical process consisting of causally linked states, say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the causation defined by the Rules of Conway's Life or by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, or whatever.  I'm not asking you to take sides in my debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Stathis, just trying to understand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, if we try to argue that your model is an accurate description.
</em><br>
<p>There are really two questions.
<br>
1. What is the source of conscious experience?
<br>
2. Is X conscious, for some X?
<br>
<p>To answer the first question, I proposed a mathematical model that is not too
<br>
far removed from what is going on in the human brain, but vastly simpler.  You
<br>
are free to accept it, propose another model, or reject the idea of
<br>
consciousness entirely.
<br>
<p>The mathematical model does not require consciousness to end because N
<br>
contains an infinite number of infinite, non repeating sequences such that
<br>
adjacent values are algorithmically similar and arbitrary values can be
<br>
arbitrarily non-similar.  Given two times t and u, u &gt; t, in sequence S, the
<br>
total conscious experience is K(S(u)|S(t)).  This number can be arbitrarily
<br>
large in N.  But in any implementation in a finite universe this number is
<br>
bounded by the size of its memory.  But we don't know that the universe is
<br>
finite.  We only know that our model of it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also would note that some of the preceding posts in this thread might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be read as saying that a GLUT is conscious.  I don't think that one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be, as I've made clear in another thread, mainly because it easily reduces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in my opinion) to timeless patterns, e.g., like clouds of dust scattered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over lightyears in space, or patterns that can be discerned in rocks.
</em><br>
<p>A GLUT is not conscious because it does not define a sequence S of
<br>
algorithmically similar states.  Nor is a state machine with a random GLUT. 
<br>
The state table has to be simple, such as the fixed part of a Turing machine.
<br>
The sequence of tape values implements a possible consciousness.
