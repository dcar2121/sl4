2 typo corrections, and another comment....

<br>
<p>And the comment I'd like to add:  it may seem that I've contradicted
<br>
myself by first saying that &quot;subjective anticipation&quot; has no impact on
<br>
the world and then saying &quot;it can seriously cripple your influence on
<br>
the world in the future.&quot;  So I should clarify that.  Anticipating
<br>
that you are going to be someone who isn't going to have the memory of
<br>
that anticipation, or anticipating things in the wrong proportions as
<br>
John Clark has done... both of those can have negative impacts on the
<br>
future people who have your memories.  But if you don't believe that
<br>
those future people are really &quot;you&quot; then you haven't actually hurt
<br>
yourself, as far as you are free to believe.  All you've done is
<br>
negatively affected the future of someone else... or in the case of
<br>
John Clark, negatively affected the future of a bunch of people who he
<br>
believes are all the &quot;same version&quot; of him, even though they each have
<br>
different experiences and will be able to go out and each affect the
<br>
world in different ways.  So in a sense, subjective anticipation is
<br>
harmless.  But the one measurablely negative effect it does have is
<br>
that it fails to maximize your future influence on the world.  And
<br>
this is really the reason why I would argue for adopting objective
<br>
anticipation and forgetting about subjective anticipation.
<br>
<p>One further comment:  most of my intuitions on this come from thinking
<br>
about the Many Worlds Interpretation, something I've believed in for a
<br>
number of years.  And there is is just crystal clear that you *must*
<br>
interpret anticipation in this way.  Because nature is always making
<br>
copies of you, and they are always fanning out and developing into
<br>
different people.  If you don't adhere to the objective anticipation
<br>
criterion that I have outlined, then you will fail to behave like a
<br>
Bayesian would in a quantum world.  Furthermore, adopting Clark's
<br>
point of view would lead to the absurd conclusion that observers would
<br>
behave very different in the Many Worlds Interpretation than they
<br>
would in the Copenhagen Interpretation, which is obviously
<br>
incorrect... as they are both just different descriptions of the same
<br>
*physical* theory.  It's just a matter of interpretation, therefore
<br>
there cannot be any difference in behavior.
