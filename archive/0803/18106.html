<em>&gt; Exactly.  I think the only reason John Clark and Vladimir Nesov are

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  While they can come up with whatever bizarre definition for identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or consciousness they like, it really doesn't tell you anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  meaningful, because they are only talking about something subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (viewing someone as an &quot;adjective&quot; for instance).  You can believe
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  meaningful concept, and neither is subjective anticipation.  But you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  *cannot* believe whatever you want about objective anticipation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Anticipating the wrong thing is going to cause most of your copies to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think that answer is 50% because what happens to observers doesn't
<br>
matter, as long as they have the same information about this question,
<br>
and information that reasoning engine has is what allows it to
<br>
calculate probabilities. It's precisely attempt to do the math, to
<br>
formulate the problem so as to assess the right number to base actions
<br>
of agents on, that changed my mind about the answer. Common intuition
<br>
in this case seems to be wrong. My error was to immediately accept the
<br>
answer I intuited, 100/101, and then to rationalize the reason for
<br>
that answer to be right.
<br>
<p>'Subjectivity' doesn't matter either. When you observe the
<br>
environment, the body that you happen to inhabit is just one more
<br>
feature of said environment, it is only relevant as a functioning
<br>
reasoning engine that also must come in contact with the territory to
<br>
obtain information. If the question doesn't concern the body and
<br>
information already resides in it, it doesn't matter how this body is
<br>
organized or transformed. It might be a 100-headed borg, it might be a
<br>
single person. If information available to me about the world says
<br>
that I'm ignorant about coin flip, I asses probability of it coming up
<br>
heads as 50%.
<br>
<p>If my copy that might have observed &quot;heads&quot; is destroyed with
<br>
probability 90% instead of being copied 100 times, it reformulates the
<br>
question. Now the question is not just about the coin &quot;if the coin
<br>
came up heads&quot;, it's &quot;if the coin that you will observe came up heads&quot;
<br>
that includes parts about the coin, and parts about agent body. In
<br>
this case what happened to the body does matter, it's a part of the
<br>
territory that question addresses. If body is destroyed with
<br>
probability 90% in event of coin coming up &quot;heads&quot;, only 55% of
<br>
original probability mass corresponds to situations where there is a
<br>
body. The fact that I'm doing the reasoning tells me that a surviving
<br>
body is on the territory, so the world is in those 55% or original
<br>
probability mass. Given this fact, I conclude that probability of coin
<br>
coming up &quot;heads&quot; is 1/11.
