<p><p>Non sequitur.  And in any case, I do not assume a FOOM scenario;  
<br>
indeed, I have a history of arguing quite the opposite.  It does not

invalidate my original point, which was that nobody will be paying  
<br>
attention until such a time that tripping over it is unavoidable  
<br>
unless you put a lot of effort toward attracting attention.  This  
<br>
argument is not dependent on the speed of the scenario, though outcome  
<br>
distributions do vary a bit with scenario speed.
