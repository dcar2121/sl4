<em>&gt;&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    You would *not* say to yourself, &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not Slawek
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    anymore.  I must be someone else.&quot;  No.  You would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    &quot;WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    just *happened*?  AND WHAT AM I, SLAWEK, doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    here? and why is everything blurry when I look across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    room?  Whose body is this?  It's not *mine*!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;   I think that it's a *fact* that you would speak and think just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;   that.  You would then, surely, be forced to admit that you went
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;   with your memories when they were transferred to California.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, this person in California would definitely &quot;feel like Slawek&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but why should &quot;someone who feels like X&quot; imply &quot;someone is X&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Because he accumulates additional experience just as the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slawek did.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry Lee, but this is not the *kind* of answer I'm looking for. All the answers 
<br>
I've received so far from you and other people already assume that memories are 
<br>
important whereas the original question is still why are memories important in the 
<br>
first place, and not just to survival, but why are they so important, period. Thank 
<br>
you, though, for trying and I encourage you to keep trying. I must confess I knew 
<br>
full well how difficult it must be to answer this question as it forces a person to 
<br>
become aware of this core assumption and to examine its validity.
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Consider:  after you've been an hour in California
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting used to Lee's body and Lee's circumstances, then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfer your memories to Stuart's body in Vienna for that period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time. (Yes... please!  I know I'm assuming that &quot;you&quot; are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transferred, but hear me out.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When it's all over, and you're back in Slawek's own house in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old familiar body, you would have no doubt that you had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traveled to California and then to Vienna.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now if you want to say, &quot;Oh, well, that wasn't me in California,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was someone else&quot;, then answer me this: if you weren't in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; California during that hour, where were you while all this happened?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I can answer this in detail, but let me just say that I'm not interested in 
<br>
debating whether you or I am right about this. This would not be productive at this 
<br>
stage. We won't be ready to do that until you can answer why memories are 
<br>
important. Right now, and just for fun only, I can give you an outline of what that 
<br>
answer would look like, but hope you leave it alone, at least for now. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my perspective, (what I define as) &quot;I&quot; (different from what you mean by &quot;I&quot;) 
</em><br>
never went anywhere. I never left my house even though I remember now having an 
<br>
experience of being in California and Vienna in other bodies. I only remember this 
<br>
but have not experienced being in California or Vienna.  What I actually 
<br>
experienced was a replacement of Slawek-type memories with Lee-type memories and 
<br>
then replacement of Lee-type memories with updated Slawek-type memories that were 
<br>
pretty cool. You see, my &quot;I&quot; is not attached to any type of personal memories. 
<br>
While personal memories are fun and precious, they do not define what I am (notice 
<br>
&quot;what&quot; instead of &quot;who&quot;) so they are expendable. I would compare Slawek-type 
<br>
memories that currently occupy my brain to a role I'm currently acting out or to a 
<br>
bunch of clothes I'm used to wearing. I can act out different roles in different 
<br>
clothes without affecting my existence in any way.
<br>
