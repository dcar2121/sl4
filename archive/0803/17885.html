<em>&gt;Hi all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The AGI-08 conference (agi-08.org) occurred last weekend in Memphis...!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I had hoped to write up a real scientific summary of AGI-08, but at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the moment it doesn't look like I'll find the time, so instead I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt;send out this briefer and more surface-level summary...
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to say that this was one of my favorite conferences.  The 
<br>
location could not have been better - an environment of quality and 
<br>
character.  Just the right mix for the topic.  Presentations were 
<br>
informative and each speaker was well-versed and enthusiastic.  I 
<br>
loved the workshop - it was a little controversial and a lot of fun.
<br>
<p>Thanks Ben and I look forward to AGI-09!
<br>

<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;Firstly, the conference went VERY well.  The tone was upbeat, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussions were animated and intelligent, and all in all there was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feel of real excitement about having so many AGI people in one place
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at one time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Attendance was good: We originally anticipated 80 registrants but had 120+.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The conference room was a futuristic setting called &quot;The Zone&quot; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looked sorta like the Star Trek bridge -- with an excellent if mildly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;glitchy video system that, during Q&amp;A sessions, showed the questioner
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up on a big screen in front of the room.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The unconventional format (brief talks followed by long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion/Q&amp;A) sessions was both productive and popular.  The whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing was video-ed and at some point the video record will be made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;available online (I don't know the intended timing of this yet).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The proceedings volume was released by IOS Press a few weeks before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the conference and is a thick impressive-looking tome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The interdisciplinary aspect of the conference seemed to work well --
</em><br>
<em>&gt;e.g. the session on virtual-worlds AI was chaired by Sibley Verbeck
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(CEO of Electric Sheep Company) and the session on neural nets was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chaired by Randal Koene (a neuroscientist from Boston University).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This definitely made the discussions deeper than if it had been an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI-researchers-only crowd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Plenty of folks from government agencies and large and small
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corporations were in attendance, as well as of course many AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;academics and non-affiliated AGI enthusiasts.  Among the AI academics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were some highly-respected stalwarts of the AI community, alongside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the new generation...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There seemed to be nearly as many Europeans as Americans there, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a pleasant surprise, and some Asians as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The post-conference workshop on ethical, sociocultural and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;futurological issues drew about 60 people and was a bit of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free-for-all, with many conflicting perspectives presented quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emphatically and vociferously.  I think most of that discussion was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NOT captured on video (it took place in a different room where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;video-ing was less convenient), though the workshop talks themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The media folks in attendance seemed most energized by the section on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;AI in virtual worlds, which is because in this section the presenters
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(me, Andrew Shilliday, and Martin Magnusson) showed movies of cute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;animated characters doing stuff.  This gave the nontechnical observers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;something to grab onto, which most of the other talks did not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As at the earlier AGI-06 workshop, one of the most obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observations after listening to the talks was that a lot of AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;research programs are pursuing fairly similar architectures and ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but using different languages to describe what they're doing.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggests that making a systematic effort at finding a common language
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and really understanding the true overlaps and differences of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;various approaches, would be very beneficial.  There was some talk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organizing a small, invitation-only workshop among practicing AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system architects, perhaps in Fall 2008, with a view toward making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progress in this direction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Much enthusiasm was expressed for an AGI-09, and it was decided that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this will likely be located in Washington DC, a location that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;give us the opportunity to use the conference to help energize various
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government agencies about AGI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There was also talk about the possibility of an AGI online technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journal, and a group of folks will be following that up, led by Pei
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wang.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An &quot;AGI Roadmap&quot; project was also discussed, which would involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aligning different cognitive architectures currently proposed insofar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as possible, but also go beyond that.  Another key aspect of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;roadmap might be an agreement on certain test environments or tasks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that could be used to compare and explore various AGI architectures in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more of a common way than is now possible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lots of ideas ... lots of enthusiasm ... a strong feeling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;community-building ... so, I'm really grateful to Stan Franklin, Pei
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wang, Sidney DeMello and Bruce Klein and everyone else who helped to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organize the conference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Finally, an interesting piece of feedback was given by my mother, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knows nothing about AGI research (she runs a social service agency)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and who did not attend the conference but read the media coverage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;afterwards.  What she said is that the media seems to be taking a far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;less skeptical and mocking tone toward AGI these days, as opposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;7-10 years ago when I first started appearing in the media now and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then.  I think this is true, and it signifies a real shift in cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attitude.  This shift is what allowed The Singularity Is Near to sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as many copies as it did; and what encouraged so many AI academics to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;come to a mildly out-of-the-mainstream conference on AGI.  Society,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;including the society of scientists, is starting to wake up to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;notion that, given modern technology and science, human-level AGI is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no longer a pipe dream but a potential near-term reality.  w00t!  Of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;course there is a long way to go in terms of getting this kind of work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;taken as seriously as it should be, but at least things seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;going in the right direction.
