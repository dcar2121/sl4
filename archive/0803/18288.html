</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Then we disagree, as follows. Your last paragraph conveys, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  naturally too briefly, one standard way of saying what a computation is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  That your views lead directly to beliefs I consider faintly absurd does
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do I take that as meaning you don't agree that a person following a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No, because sufficiently low-level table lookups are just fine. Not
<br>
as any kind of estimate to take to the bank, suppose me to be
<br>
claiming that when you start looking up bit patches of 10^6 or so
<br>
---or in the inimitable example of a Life Board, a region 1000x1000
<br>
---then a very small diminution of consciousness occurs.
<br>
<p>(By that last phrase, if anyone else is reading this, it does not mean
<br>
any event or condition that the subject is later to be able to report
<br>
upon.  For example, if you were killed at 5pm today, but then a
<br>
duplicate of you were created at 6pm and given all the memories
<br>
you would have acquired anyway during that hour, then you too
<br>
cannot report on &quot;not having really been there&quot; during that hour.
<br>
The diminution of consciousness of which I speak has the same
<br>
quality.)
<br>
<p>I had a great idea while talking to a friend last night on the phone.
<br>
<p>Question: would you consider that a given program had passed
<br>
the Turing Test under these conditions?
<br>
<p>A. All Earth's six hundred million English speaking people interact
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by teletype with it, some specialist computer folks up to several
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand interactions each.
<br>
B.  Each interaction consists of a question to the program/human
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of less than 10,000 characters.  The reply of the program (or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;human, the interviewer does not know) is always of about 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same length and complexity of that of the question, i.e.,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around 10^4 characters.
<br>
C. Each interviewer is convinced that as of 2008, the entity typing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back responses must be a human being.
<br>
<p>My guess is that your answer would be &quot;yes, if it is a program then
<br>
it has passed the Turing Test&quot;, and that, moreover, the remote
<br>
entity (whether human or not) was conscious and had internal
<br>
experiences.
<br>
<p>Now, what if it is revealed to you than an Alien intelligence had 
<br>
deposited this program/machine in the possession of an Earth
<br>
person collaborator, and that the computronium based machine
<br>
was merely doing a table lookup on all the possible 26^10000
<br>
possible keyboard inputs?  In other words, the Alien had somehow,
<br>
perhaps by making untold trillions of copies of himself, had personally
<br>
answered all possible 10,000 character questions, and then had
<br>
just left the device to parrot his responses?  You think it's still
<br>
conscious?
