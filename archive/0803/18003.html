<p>
<em>&gt; So what *does* it include?
</em><br>
<p>Exactly what I listed as the Declaration of Friendliness in the e-mail.  I 
<br>
copy-and-paste it below.
<br>
<p>Hi, I'm Mark Waser.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am hereby declaring myself to be a Friendly entity as of March 12, 2008. 
<br>
I have not knowingly/intentionally performed any UnFriendly actions since 
<br>
this date.
<br>
<p><p><p>I have not previously been declared UnFriendly by any declared Friendly 
<br>
entity.    I have not been requested to put any disputed actions or 
<br>
unintentional UnFriendly actions in this declaration by any declared 
<br>
Friendly entity.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am voluntarily undertaking the goals of Friendliness because I understand 
<br>
that doing so is in my own best self-interest and is the best way to achieve 
<br>
all my other goals.
<br>
<p><p><p>I am voluntarily undertaking the primary/overriding goal of Friendliness as 
<br>
my primary and pre-eminent goal.  I understand this goal to be:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;a.. Do not act contrary to someone's/anyone's goals unless absolutely 
<br>
necessary for the fulfillment of a reasonable/rational personal goal 
<br>
(explicitly not including generic sub-goals like money, power, pleasure, 
<br>
religion, etc.)
<br>
I am voluntarily undertaking the goal of spreading Friendliness and 
<br>
assigning it a reasonable priority (i.e. enough to be a net asset to a 
<br>
Friendly Society) because I understand that doing so is in my own 
<br>
self-interest.
<br>
<p><p><p>I will act in accordance with these goals according to the rules/laws of a 
<br>
Friendly Society included in this declaration.  I understand that if I 
<br>
knowingly and intentionally act contrary to these rules/laws that I can be 
<br>
declared UnFriendly and will need to make another declaration of 
<br>
Friendliness including information about the most recent times that I have 
<br>
been declared UnFriendly.
<br>
<p><p><p>I understand that the rules/laws of a Friendly Society include the 
<br>
requirement that all statements in this declaration be truthful under 
<br>
penalty of having this declaration declared null and void and my being 
<br>
declared UnFriendly for attempting to impersonate a Friendly entity.
<br>
<p><p><p>In particular, I understand that hiding or lying about any UnFriendly 
<br>
actions (even if unintentionally or unknowingly performed) is contrary to 
<br>
the rules/laws of a Friendly Society.  I understand that while I may defend 
<br>
myself against unfair charges of UnFriendly actions, I must admit to all 
<br>
UnFriendly actions (even if unknowingly and/or intentionally performed) and 
<br>
must include all disputed charges in this declaration as requested for a 
<br>
reasonable length of time or risk having this declaration declared null and 
<br>
void and my being declared UnFriendly.
<br>
<p><p><p>I understand that the rules/laws of Friendly Society state that declaring 
<br>
another entity UnFriendly is, in itself, UnFriendly unless there is 
<br>
reasonable cause for doing so, I have executed a reasonable due process, and 
<br>
am sure beyond reasonable doubt.  I understand that the rules/laws further 
<br>
require that I retract any declarations of UnFriendliness if *any* 
<br>
reasonable doubt subsequently arises and I must volunteer my most recent 
<br>
retractions of UnFriendliness declarations (if any) when asked and in any 
<br>
subsequent UnFriendliness declarations.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;signed&gt;
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark R. Waser
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Without a definition of &quot;reasonable/rational personal goal&quot;, how can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone say?
</em><br>
<p>Friendliness only requires that you make your best honest effort to make 
<br>
that determination.  If you honestly believe that you acting Friendly then 
<br>
you are acting Friendly as long as you listen and attempt to understand to 
<br>
the best of your ability any counter-arguments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even then, AFAIK you haven't explained why it's in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AGI's self-interest to be Friendly.
</em><br>
<p>No, I have not done so on this list except by claiming that it is in *every* 
<br>
entity's self-interest to be Friendly and then backing it up by declaring 
<br>
myself Friendly.  If you can show me a case where it is not to my advantage 
<br>
to be Friendly, then I will either fix my declaration or remove my claim to 
<br>
a solution to Friendliness.
<br>
<p>I am working very hard to make this a disprovable theory (the *only* 
<br>
valuable kind  :-)
<br>
<p><p><p>Thanks for the questions.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark
