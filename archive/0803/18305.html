<em>&gt; Suppose you have a 3 way Turing test between a human, a GLUT, and a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose memory is set to read-only at the start of the test (or equivalently,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose mental state is reset after each question).  Is the read-only human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious?
</em><br>
<p>Of course the read-only human is conscious. Suppose it's only Homer,
<br>
and he's only reciting the Iliad around a campfire. We adjust his nervous
<br>
system so that during the narration, on which he is totally focused, 
<br>
neither the campfire, nor any of the sounds, nor any other of his
<br>
senses are leaving any record whatsoever in his memory. (Naturally
<br>
we have to idealize this a bit in order to address, in principle, the
<br>
answer to your idealized &quot;read-only human&quot; question.)
<br>
<p>It may be easy for some to say that there is no such thing as consciousness,
<br>
but someday we'll have much more thorough characterizations of it than
<br>
we do now, and the argument that they're wrong will be all the more solid.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, you can choose to believe that the Alien itself and its
<br>
many copies were no more conscious while they were answering the
<br>
26^10000 possible questions, than is the relatively simple little lookup
<br>
device they left behind.  If so, then you're quite wrong.
