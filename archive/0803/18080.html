<em>&gt; Back to the main question about importance of memories [to people]. See if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dilemma clarifies anything. If you had to choose between 2 options, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you prefer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Option 1) In 1 minute you will go into an eternal coma. On the bright side,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed that your brain, and thus your memories, will remain exactly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are now until the end of Universe.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Option 2) In 1 minute all your personal memories will be completely erased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your brain, but, other than that, this brain will function just like any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy brain that's able to form and retain new personal memories and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the general knowledge acquired throughout the brain's life, like being able
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak, read and write English, do math, etc. However, this brain will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its name, its opinions, its family and friends, its tastes, where it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; located, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none of that personal stuff.

<p>Humans did not evolve in an environment where they had to make such choices,
<br>
so lets say they choose randomly.  Those that choose 2 will have children that
<br>
inherit the personality characteristics that made them more likely to make
<br>
that choice.  Therefore future generations will usually choose 2.  Of course
<br>
they will not know why they prefer this choice because their parents would
<br>
have no memory of ever making it.
