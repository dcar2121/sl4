</em><br>
<p>This goes to my point about how much memory is required or is even
<br>
considered useful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But still, if I take your question above quite literally, the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  still is no, I think. BTW, what has this to do with Memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Merging Possible for Close Duplicates?
</em><br>
<p>I agree that the answer should be no.  Along the same intention of
<br>
maximizing runtime should be maximizing resolution and bandwidth.
<br>
There is also a point to be made here for the idea that intelligent
<br>
compression allows a larger volume of data to be written to memory
<br>
through the fixed-bandwidth channel.  That's a different topic though,
<br>
and you're already asking what this line of thinking has to do with
<br>
the subject of close duplicates.
<br>
<p>What determines how close a duplicate is to the original?  Whether the
<br>
TE uses teleportation or computronium uploads, the principle measure
<br>
of identity is ... what exactly?  It seems that often it is memories
<br>
that are used to determine identity up to the point of copy, and that
<br>
instances diverge from each other because of their new memories.  I
<br>
think the &quot;what is identity&quot; question is endemic to this &quot;Close
<br>
duplicates&quot; discussion but it quickly turns into a distracting
<br>
quagmire from which there is no return.  It seems there are others
<br>
here who believe memory is not the sole measure of identity, which
<br>
gives rise to a completely different view of what a close duplicate
<br>
would mean.
<br>
<p>I ask about the relationship between experience of an event and memory
<br>
of the event because it is relevant to how memory can be merged
<br>
without losing the ability to reconstruct the experience.  I would
<br>
have to start a separate thread to discuss what it means to believe in
<br>
a memory as experience, which (like the identity question) is relevant
<br>
but distracting.
<br>
<p>I argue that it should not cause cognitive dissonance to say, &quot;I went
<br>
to the movies&quot; at the same time &quot;I went to the bookstore&quot; (to use your
<br>
original analogy) because both copies have a belief in their identity
<br>
as Me.  I also currently believe that each copy, for the duration that
<br>
each existed, was Me.  As long as I am not bound by a belief that my
<br>
identity can only exist as a linear series of experience, there is no
<br>
problem with being several simultaneous duplicates.  Is that a clearer
<br>
statement of support for my original assessment that close duplicates
<br>
should merge at least as easily as they are created?
