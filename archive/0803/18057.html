<p><em>&gt; [Lee asked asked about *when* you were so young that you were

<em>&gt; not the same person you are now, etc.]:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Care to mention ages, or at least proportions?  Since we don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  good measures and good tools, (and eventually may have many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  different but reliable measures such as we have in statistical theory)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  no precise answers can be forthcoming at this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not sure about proportions; but the rate of change is quite high (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't consider I was the same person as 3 years ago, pretty much).
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, interesting.  Okay, if you don't mind, I'll keep that figure
<br>
in mind!  :-)  But it's quite reasonable compared to &quot;day persons&quot;:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Could you be embracing Mike Perry's notion of &quot;day persons&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  That is, each day you wake up you are really a different person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (Not that Mike endorses this view at all!)  But it's silly, IMNSHO
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to go around denying that you are not the same person you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  yesterday or a few minutes ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think we are talking of difference of degree, not of kind.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly right!  From the above, it does sound like you believe that
<br>
you are the same person you were yesterday (not forgetting for an
<br>
instant that one gradually changes, and, I say, changes into someone
<br>
else). Right, it *is* a matter of degree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can merge me with a recent duplicate of me; or we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merge Shakespear with Einstein; the second is just much harder.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. And I might argue that the result could easily be a person
<br>
that was neither Einstein or Shakespeare. Operationally:  after
<br>
we finish that horrendous merging of the two, we might have
<br>
a dialog with him that goes:
<br>
<p>Us:         Are you the same person you were yesterday?
<br>
<p>Al-Will:  Oh yes. That was something that was the same
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my old lives.
<br>
<p>Us:         If we had asked either Al or Will, before the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;merger, what would they have said regarding
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how many years it took to become a different
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person (i.e. not the same person) through the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;natural process of aging?
<br>
<p>Al-Will:  Well, as Al I would have said &lt;insert answer 1
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here&gt; and as Will I would have said &lt;insert answer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 here&gt;.
<br>
<p>Us:         It seems to us that the merger changed you considerably.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you say that the merger of the 20th century
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German speaking scientist with the 17th century British
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;playwright inflicted more change than either &lt;answer 1&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or &lt;answer 2&gt;?
<br>
<p>I cannot imagine Al-Will saying, &quot;Oh no. That was nothing so severe
<br>
as becoming &lt;answer1&gt; or &lt;answer2&gt; years older!
<br>
<p>Almost surely Al-Will would say that he is not the same person as
<br>
either of the two previous worthies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Mathematically, we could claim that two duplicates represent 1.001
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, and tend towards 1.8 people as they age; if their experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are different enough, they will reach 2 people.
</em><br>
<p>I quite agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not too sure about the moral consequences of this. Logically, killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one duplicate immediately is barely a crime; the evil of killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increases as the two diverge, and there are a host of questions -
</em><br>
<p>I agree. But reducing the two physically distinct processes to
<br>
just one, as you understand I have claimed, amounts to letting
<br>
the 1.001 person live only 60 minutes an hour instead of 120.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Nozick's seriously stupid idea of &quot;closest continuuer&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't know what that idea is, but the name sounds appealing.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, he said that if you had n-duplicates made and then died
<br>
yourself, that only the &quot;closest continuer&quot; would really be you.
<br>
How totally nuts.  Why exactly aren't the rest you, who may
<br>
differ infinitesimally from the anointed one?  &lt;rant suppressed&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do feel that if I was duplicated every day, and the duplicates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were either frozen or sent of to live other lives, then (if I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deprived of my social interactions and my posessions) I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have a strong claim to being &quot;Stuart Armstrong&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Why need only one of you get to be Stuart?  From a physicist's
<br>
perspective, they're all pretty similar---as they should be: they're
<br>
close duplicates after all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  P.S. I'm making my way through your very interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  <a href="http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf">http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf</a> , but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  alas, am woefully not up to speed discussing this issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  on this list. But maybe I'll get better  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Danke! :-)
</em><br>
<p>You're very welcome.
