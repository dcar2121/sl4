<p>I think the issue here is as much with the word &quot;probability&quot; which
<br>
can mean a lot of different things in different contexts.  You have to
<br>
be careful to specify what you're asking:  in other words, &quot;the
<br>
probability of what?&quot;  In this case, the probability that is relevant
<br>
for &quot;what you should anticipate&quot; is the probability that a randomly
<br>
selected future copy of your brain will observe heads.  It's not that
<br>
probability and anticipation are &quot;different concepts&quot; as you've
<br>
suggested, it's just that for the only objective kind of anticipation
<br>
you can define... this is the relevant probability to ask about.  And
<br>
it's not the same as the probability that an outside observer (who
<br>
isn't being copied) will see heads or tails.

</em><br>
<p>Thank you for the clear presentation of your point of view on this
<br>
subject.  I think I see exactly why you're saying what you are.  But I
<br>
still think this should not be relevant to anticipation.
<br>
<p>The way in which you've made the two situations different is by adding
<br>
the condition &quot;you're told that there is at least one sphere in the
<br>
box&quot;.  Because you did not add the condition &quot;you're told how many
<br>
spheres are in the box&quot;, you can come to different conclusions in
<br>
these two situations (copying the spheres versus destroying with 90%
<br>
probability).  However, if there is an observer in each sphere, and
<br>
you ask about what those observers will each see... then you don't
<br>
come to different conclusions.  Each observer counts separately... so
<br>
your probability has to be weighted by the number of observers.  You
<br>
are differentiating between &quot;no observers&quot; and &quot;any observers&quot; but
<br>
you're not differentiating between one obsever and a hundred
<br>
observers.... and you *should* be.  Basically, you are just going back
<br>
to what John Clark is saying, which is that you don't see any
<br>
difference between one observer and a hundred identical observers.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this will make what I'm saying clearer... imagine that you
<br>
make a bet with some external observer before the coin is flipped.
<br>
The first issue is how to make such a bet, because if it comes up
<br>
heads, all of the copies will want to collect on the bet.  But there
<br>
is only one external observer to pay up.  So does he owe 100 times
<br>
what he bet (once to each observer)?  Or does he just owe the amount
<br>
he bet, and that gets split up and a fraction is paid to each
<br>
observer?  If you decide on the first way, the external observer will
<br>
see it as unfair.  If you decide on the second way, the copies will
<br>
see it as unfair.  After all, they made a bet and won it, and they are
<br>
only getting paid a fraction of the money that they bet!
<br>
<p>But regardless of which way the money is handled, I think it's clear
<br>
what both of the original observers should anticipate.  From the
<br>
perspective of the person being conditionally copied, there is a 1%
<br>
chance that they will see the coin come up tails, and a 99% chance
<br>
that it will come up heads.  If it comes up tails, then they will owe
<br>
say $1.  If it comes up tails, they will expect to get $1 but so will
<br>
all of the other copies who are also witnessing it coming up tails.
<br>
So they will have to either fight over who gets the dollar, divide it
<br>
up, or convince the other person placing the bet that they are all
<br>
owed $1 each since they all made the bet.  So in planning for the
<br>
future, they should expect it will very likely come up heads...
<br>
however, if it does there will be financial issues to resolve over who
<br>
collects the money... so it wouldn't be sensible to place the bet,
<br>
unless the other party agrees to pay *each* copy who wins the bet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the perspective of the person not being conditionally copied,
</em><br>
they anticipate there is a 50% chance of seeing it come up heads.  If
<br>
it comes up tails, then they collect $1 from the other person, and
<br>
nobody is copied.  If it comes up heads, then there are 100 copies all
<br>
asking for $1 from him.  And he realizes that he cannot afford to pay
<br>
them all... so he starts saying &quot;wait a minute... I only made a bet
<br>
with *one* of you!  now there are 100 of you and I can't pay you all!
<br>
which one is the *original*?&quot;  The problem is, there is no original...
<br>
they are all legitimate progeny of the original and they all have an
<br>
independent existence by this point.  Separate lives and separate
<br>
financial interests.
<br>
<p>Does this clear it up?
<br>
