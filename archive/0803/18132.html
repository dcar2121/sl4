</em><br>
<p>You do not need to go back.  The original context was a fictional
<br>
scenario where you listened to a 20 minute tale of your wife's day.
<br>
There is a level of detail that is &quot;just the facts,&quot; detail that
<br>
includes humorous situations perhaps only your wife would find
<br>
relevant, details that includes particular facial expressions during
<br>
the retelling, details including respiration and heart rate of the
<br>
story-teller or listener, ad nauseam.  I was using 'nuances' to
<br>
include those details which provide only subtle refinements on a
<br>
reasonably useful answer to the question, &quot;How was your day?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words... you missed that point.  It was perhaps of tertiary
<br>
importance to what I was saying.  It has become a distraction.  I
<br>
would have aggressively trimmed this from my reply, but I think it
<br>
served as a self-referential example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It is similarity of structure, ultimately.  Of course, we have various
</em><br>
[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt;  Suppose that by some *obvious* [1] isomorphism,  today Lee is one bit string
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  where two 0's happen to be changed to 1's.  By all measures
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Your definition of similar is not sufficient for me to make sense of
<br>
your bit string analogy.  I &quot;get&quot; that there might be some reference
<br>
to TM or Life Board in there, but I'd have to guess too much.  I'm
<br>
learning that when I assume too much agreement I will find later than
<br>
whatever building goes up will inevitably be torn down to its unstable
<br>
foundation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If the teleporter or copying machinery is working well, there will be very few bit errors.
</em><br>
<p>I'll grant that you have a perfect copy maker including the dimension
<br>
of time, such that all bits recording ones existence up to the point
<br>
of the copy are absolutely identical.  Each instance has their new
<br>
experience encoded and appended to the identical stream of bits that
<br>
were absolutely perfectly copied.  Using the Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;etc notation from
<br>
another current thread, I would imagine normal/expected
<br>
causation-induced changes between states over a small interval of time
<br>
to be similar (though I am not 100% certain how to accurately measure
<br>
similar to five nines precision, right?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; [...]memories [..] are used to determine identity up to the point of copy [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes. Or new experiences which create or destroy small parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the structure.
</em><br>
<p>You are allowing new experience to create or destroy parts of the
<br>
structure?  That is inconsistent with your definition of preserving
<br>
information as the True history of an entity's existence.  Once the
<br>
log is open for editing, there will be no integrity to any measure.
<br>
By this possibility I could simply edit-in or edit-out any memory
<br>
necessary to force the checksum in your similarity measure.  This is
<br>
all made up TE anyway, so even if I can't hack your memory gracefully
<br>
I should be able to do so by brute force.  Oops, didn't get it right
<br>
on the first try... maybe I'll get it on the second attempt, or
<br>
fifty-second attempt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Well, I don't quite agree with your &quot;because both copies have a belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in their identity as Me&quot;.  To me, it's a fact of the matter, not a conviction.
</em><br>
<p>I have consistently used belief to indicate a subjective understanding
<br>
of the facts available to a clone.  (eg:  the clone believes itself to
<br>
be...  or I believe X from a subjective measure.)  I certainly
<br>
understand the confusion this may cause since the word belief is
<br>
overloaded with meaning such that it should perhaps not be used at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Well, that's two of us. Actually, there may be three or four here who agree with us!  :-)
</em><br>
<p>That we agree on this point is probably the only reason you have had
<br>
any patience with this thread.  I appreciate the dialog.  It has
<br>
reiterated for me how difficult communication is when two people
<br>
agree, let alone when they may not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; close duplicates should merge at least as easily as they are created?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I don't see how that last statement follows from anything above.
</em><br>
<p>I do not know how to proceed.  The statement does not follow from
<br>
anything above, it was the starting point for my participation in this
<br>
thread.  It has taken this dialog to reach the point of agreement
<br>
above.  I imagine this is where in an in-person conversation that one
<br>
of us would offer to refresh drinks, then start again on a different
<br>
topic upon returning.  :)
