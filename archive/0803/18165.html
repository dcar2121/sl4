Jeff and Stathis are reaching agreement that there is no such
<br>
thing as a &quot;self&quot;.
<br>
<p>Allow me to differ, albeit rather sarcastically.
<br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; just that having that sort of mindset is not conducive to survival of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the potential replicator.
</em><br>
<p>Please forgive the tone of my reply, but this is how I wish to proceed.
<br>
<p>I'm glad that Jeff and Stathis aren't astronomer-wanna-be's. Here
<br>
is how a dialog between them might have gone:
<br>
<p>Jeff:       You know, most astronomers really don't understand that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no clear difference between &quot;star&quot; and &quot;its environment&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.... or said another way, that there even *is* such a thing as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a star.
<br>
<p>Stathis:  Yes, it's actually patently false if you are looking for &quot;objective
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth&quot;. The definition of star, and the phony distinction between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the star and its environment is a side-effect of our visual system
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its lack of adequate discriminatory abilities.
<br>
<p>Jeff:       I know exactly what you mean!  In a more accurate approximation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to reality, we really have nothing more than &quot;atoms&quot; and sub-atomic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particles, and it really boils down to fundamental quarks, gluons,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the whole zoo according to the Standard Model, our fabulously
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;successful theory of matter and energy.
<br>
<p>Stathis:  Yes, exactly.  We see that there is no clear boundary between
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;star and non-star.  It's a continuous rise and lowering of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;density of quarks, gluons, and the rest, as you go from the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;center where there is the highest concentration (usually
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called the &quot;center of the star&quot;) out towards the layers of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lower density, there is no abrupt ending or boundary anywhere.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the solar wind, for example, is included, one can only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say even roughly that a so-called star extends a light year
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or more in diameter.
<br>
<p>Jeff:      Precisely.  It's just an illusion, although it does sort of sound
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bit weird or zen-ish to say that there are no such things as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars, but the whole concept ultimately has to turn out to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false.
<br>
<p>Stathis: It's even clearer that there is no such thing as a star if we 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;examine the question from yet another direction. If you
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider the entire possibility space that this clumping
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of subatomic particles has, there is no reason at all to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider that it's even the same clump from moment to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moment! The entire collection of subatomic particles,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extending maybe 30,000 AU in each direction from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the &quot;point&quot; of maximum concentration --- ha! as if there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*were* such a point &lt;visibly exasperated at the fallacies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those who speak of a star's &quot;center&quot;&gt; --- isn't at all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same from instant to instant. The trajectory in phase
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space is in constant motion at all times.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course [continues my parody of Stathis], we understand
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how people and astronomers came to this faulty conclusion;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's just that having that sort of mindset was conducive to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the survival of the &quot;star-meme&quot;, a reification that enables
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it to spread easily from &quot;mind&quot; to &quot;mind&quot;, and helps 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astronomers gain more information about what's out there.
<br>
<p>Returning to the actual Stathis, who, after all, as I quoted above
<br>
really did write
<br>
<p><em>        &gt; If you consider the entire possibility space of intelligent organisms,
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; there is no reason to consider that you are the same entity from
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; moment to moment or distinguish between self and other at all;
</em><br>
<p>well, one wonders based on this if he's some sort of nominalist (as opposed
<br>
to realists who---most of us---do reify rather often).
<br>
<p>Jeff (the real one) went on
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  I just don't think there is any real meaning to &quot;personal identity&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  besides the utility you attach to being able to control future events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  The way I look at it, I care about my &quot;future self&quot; (or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  accurately &quot;future selves&quot;) only because we have a lot in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  common and I have a lot of influence on him.  Not because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I think we are the same person.
</em><br>
<p>Perish the thought!  How can you possibly be the same person you
<br>
were ten seconds ago?  Why, the person reading this very sentence
<br>
has, of course, utterly no responsibility for what that other so-called
<br>
Jeff creature wrote yesterday.  By no means are they the same
<br>
person, after all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  A person to me is defined by a particular sequential history
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of memories.  Every sequence is a different person, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  two such sequences share a common past.
</em><br>
<p>Well, actually, I'm relieved.  I may be misreading, but it looks as 
<br>
though Jeff believes in &quot;people&quot; after all.  That is here he's now
<br>
saying that each *sequence* is a different person (as opposed,
<br>
I think, to  some other sequence who'd be someone else).  Wait!
<br>
What happened? A moment ago he was saying &quot;Not because I 
<br>
think that we [he and his earlier &quot;self&quot;] are the same person.&quot; 
<br>
Now he's saying that a whole sequence of persons is a person
<br>
after all. Confusing, isn't it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  So the question of whether I will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  to &quot;enjoy experiencing the future&quot; is already tautologically false by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  my definition.  I *know* that I won't be around in the future... the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  person who I am now will be very different by then.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Now&quot; being &quot;this instant&quot;?  By then?  Well &quot;by then&quot; must be much
<br>
less than ten seconds, since you *know* that you won't be around
<br>
ten seconds from now, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Even if I just believed in a single timeline, that person would still
</em><br>
<p>That person?  I thought that you had already deconstructed anything
<br>
persisting through time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  new experiences and see the world through different eyes by then, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  as I see the world through different eyes than my past selves did.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  strictly speaking, it cannot be said that I will ever have any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  experiences than I've already had.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  Get a hold of yourself, be logical, and entirely banish the false
<br>
notion that you'll have any experiences tomorrow. [as often in my
<br>
satirical reply, heavy sarcasm is intended for any innocents reading
<br>
this].
<br>
<p>Stathis---the real one, again---agrees:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Strictly speaking, yes; why should I care about some guy that wakes up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my bed tomorrow morning and thinks he's me? Why should I care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him even if he *does* have a lot in common with me and will tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further my projects? Since I know I won't be around anyway, making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plans beyond the next second is just evolution's ploy to help propagate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a certain set of genes.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as soon as you are uploaded, you can take care of that, Stathis!
<br>
You can reprogram yourself so that you won't make plans for the 
<br>
future, so long, say, as you can contribute money or something to
<br>
see to it that your projects continue to be worked on. Oh, you don't
<br>
&quot;want&quot; to?  (Actually, I wonder &quot;who&quot; this &quot;you&quot; is who's saying this
<br>
right now.) But please see below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, so is having any sort of goal or feeling. But the point is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding all this does not make me want to reprogram my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain so that I am free of it... since that too would be contrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to my programming. I'm a kind of willing slave.
</em><br>
<p>Don't give up so easily!  You can free yourself from your slavery!
<br>
Just give the AI who awakens you from cryonic suspension,
<br>
or who oversees your uploading, explicit instructions to make
<br>
those changes that you won't have the will power to do yourself.
<br>
Do you want to be a &quot;willing slave&quot; forever?  Besides, there must
<br>
be other words for slaves who want to remain slaves.
<br>
<p>Jeff agrees totally:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  This is something that has always bugged me about a lot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of immortalists.  It seems like a big motivation for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  immortalists is that they want to &quot;keep on experiencing&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  things.
</em><br>
<p>Bingo!  We sure as hell do!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  But to me, that's silly.
</em><br>
<p>Naturally!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  You can't keep on experience things... but you can affect the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  future.  I'd like to radically extend my life, but only because I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  certain goals I want accomplished in the future and I don't trust
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  anyone else besides my &quot;future self&quot; to accomplish them.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, come now!  You can in certain circumstances become dead
<br>
sure (pun intended) that a given AI, or a given, focused organization
<br>
of people, are even more dedicated to your goals than you are.
<br>
Surely you can't believe that of all the people in the world, you
<br>
are the only one who can carry out your goals now, can you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Nor do I think I can accomplish even a small fraction of them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a natural lifespan.  In my opinion, my reasons for wanting life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  extension are rational, whereas a lot of people want life extension
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  for irrational  reasons (reasons based on the illusion of the self).
</em><br>
<p>Stathis gets the last word in, in this particular post:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, yes, I know it's silly, but not only am I unable to overcome the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion, the delusion itself stops me from *wanting* to overcome the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; delusion.
</em><br>
<p>Like I was telling Jeff, sure you can!  You just need a more positive
<br>
attitude!  Certain drugs might help.  And when an AI awakens you
<br>
in the future or you get uploaded, there will be many extremely wise
<br>
and extremely professional and competent entities around to help
<br>
you rid yourself of these silly delusions that have utterly no basis
<br>
in reality.
