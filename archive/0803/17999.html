Hi Mark,
<br>
<p>Interesting thoughts and I believe my paper that I submitted for the
<br>
AGI-2008 conference has a more formal approach to your line of thought. You
<br>
can find it at:
<br>

<br>
<p>Kind regards,
<br>
<p>Stefan

<em>&gt; Executive Summary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been arguing on the AGI list that a great way to ensure the stability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Friendliness for AGI would be to make it so that it was in an entity's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own self-interest to be Friendly (I've been calling this the Attractor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Theory of Friendliness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's obvious from hindsight, but while working on it, I had the epiphany
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it was only to my own benefit to declare Friendliness myself (duh, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's in any AGI/entity's self-interest, then it must be in *my*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have therefore declared Friendliness (codifying it in the declaration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below) and am attempting to spread it since it can be used to derive useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical guidelines for AGIs, humans, and all other entities to follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it is in their own best self-interest &lt;and mine&gt; to do so).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am also promoting my catchy new slogan &quot;Friendliness:  The Ice-9 of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ethics and the Ultimate in Self-Interest&quot; as a good way to spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness.        :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; = = = = = = = = = =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A Little More Detail
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that I have come up with a formulation of Friendliness that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stable under self-improvement because, *as far as I can tell* (the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotcha), it is in an entity's own best self-interest to be Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (according to the formulation -- but with the realization that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *probably* is a super-Friendliness that is even better that is a subset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this Friendliness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This formulation is simple enough that the intelligence required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analyze whether an action is Friendly or not (according to the formulation)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is substantially below the intelligence required to be a significant threat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolute proof that the formulation will always function as we desire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under all conditions is beyond my capabilities (at this point in time) but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since the derivable conclusions of this formulation include many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally-agreed but previously-difficult-to-prove points of ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior and do not contradict any points of ethical behavior that I know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of, I believe that we should be as safe as is ethically possible (i.e. if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it comes down to a choice between humanity or ten other more populous, more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent races -- we're still toast).  Thus far, on the AGI mailing list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one has been able to propose a scenario where humanity (or an entity) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed or abused where it is not either *clearly* contradictory to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulation or *clearly* ethically permissible for it to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destroyed/abused.  This list is now an acid test to see if anyone here can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come up with such a scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since I believe that crossing ethical boundaries for the sake of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety is a *BAD* idea (because making this allowance for ourselves actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diminishes our safety because it effectively gives others permission to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cross this boundary as well -- i.e. not be Friendly), I strongly suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it *is* formally provable that we cannot be safer than &quot;as safe as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethically possible&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems obvious in hindsight but it was an epiphany when I realized while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working on this that it would be highly beneficial to *me* to officially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declare myself to be a Friendly entity (according to the formulation) since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing so was only in my own self-interest.  I have done so on the AGI list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and am doing so again below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The coolest thing is that I think that the core of these ideas can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captured in a single catchy slogan &quot;Friendliness:  The Ice-9 of Ethics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Ultimate in Self-Interest&quot;.  Given the probable existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-Friendliness, it's a bit of hyperbole but I think that it's fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified to promote the spread of Friendliness (which is in *all* of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best interest).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There have been some fun discussions going on through the AGI list (
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.listbox.com/member/archive/303/=now">http://www.listbox.com/member/archive/303/=now</a>) including a great alien
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contact scenario thread titled 'A Few Questions for &quot;Vladimir, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Destroyer&quot;' and I am inviting any and all to take a swing at my strawman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (just make it a competent swing  :-).

<em>&gt; The Friendliness Declaration
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi, I'm Mark Waser.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am hereby declaring myself to be a Friendly entity as of March 12, 2008.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I have not knowingly/intentionally performed any UnFriendly actions since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this date.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not previously been declared UnFriendly by any declared Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity.    I have not been requested to put any disputed actions or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unintentional UnFriendly actions in this declaration by any declared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am voluntarily undertaking the goals of Friendliness because I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that doing so is in my own best self-interest and is the best way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to achieve all my other goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am voluntarily undertaking the primary/overriding goal of Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as my primary and pre-eminent goal.  I understand this goal to be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do not act contrary to someone's/anyone's goals unless absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary for the fulfillment of a reasonable/rational personal goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (explicitly not including generic sub-goals like money, power, pleasure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am voluntarily undertaking the goal of spreading Friendliness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assigning it a reasonable priority (i.e. enough to be a net asset to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly Society) because I understand that doing so is in my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I will act in accordance with these goals according to the rules/laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a Friendly Society included in this declaration.  I understand that if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowingly and intentionally act contrary to these rules/laws that I can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declared UnFriendly and will need to make another declaration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness including information about the most recent times that I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been declared UnFriendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that the rules/laws of a Friendly Society include the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirement that all statements in this declaration be truthful under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penalty of having this declaration declared null and void and my being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declared UnFriendly for attempting to impersonate a Friendly entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In particular, I understand that hiding or lying about any UnFriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions (even if unintentionally or unknowingly performed) is contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rules/laws of a Friendly Society.  I understand that while I may defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself against unfair charges of UnFriendly actions, I must admit to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UnFriendly actions (even if unknowingly and/or intentionally performed) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must include all disputed charges in this declaration as requested for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable length of time or risk having this declaration declared null and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; void and my being declared UnFriendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that the rules/laws of Friendly Society state that declaring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another entity UnFriendly is, in itself, UnFriendly unless there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable cause for doing so, I have executed a reasonable due process, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am sure beyond reasonable doubt.  I understand that the rules/laws further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require that I retract any declarations of UnFriendliness if *any*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable doubt subsequently arises and I must volunteer my most recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retractions of UnFriendliness declarations (if any) when asked and in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequent UnFriendliness declarations.
</em><br>
