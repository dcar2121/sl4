<p><em>&gt; Isomorphic copies aren't separate subjects (rather just representations

</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect assumption ;]
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, that was my subject line, and I was thereby making a claim :-)
<br>
<p>I claim that isomorphic copies separated enough in spacetime
<br>
to constitute separate physical processes are separate subjects.
<br>
Suppose that there is an absolutely identical you being held
<br>
in an Earth-like simulated city near Sirius.  It ought to matter
<br>
to you that one of them is going to shortly die.
<br>
<p>Yes, right now you are &quot;both&quot;, i.e., you can't tell whether you're
<br>
on Earth or near Sirius, (and I always claim that you actually are
<br>
in both places at the same time). But suppose that one atom of the
<br>
Earth version is missing. Does that really matter?  Surely there
<br>
are not suddenly two people where just a second ago there was
<br>
just one.  Likewise, taking away more atoms, one of them will
<br>
have to be damaged a great deal to cease being you.
<br>
<p>To return to Eliezer's hypothesis---sorry---instantly after the coin flip,
<br>
the one who got heads is duplicated all over the place.  If we stop
<br>
right there, then *subjectively* you have to figure your  odds at
<br>
only 1:100 of seeing tails since
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; then, when (all of) you are about to look at the coin, should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your subjective anticipation of seeing &quot;heads&quot; be 1:1 or 100:1?
</em><br>
<p>and here is why:  For clarity, consider that ten minutes later,
<br>
100 out of the 101 suddenly cease to exist. Then this is repeated,
<br>
and again ten minutes later instantaneous disintegration comes to
<br>
a random 100 of the 101, and this is repeated again and again.
<br>
<p>Any particular survivor of this process will remember seeing heads
<br>
over and over again, and he'll be very surprised (as he ought to be)
<br>
when he sees tails. The measure of his surprise is 100:1.
<br>
