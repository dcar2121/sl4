Eliezer originally wrote

<p><em>&gt;  If you flip a fair quantum coin, have your exoself generate 100

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  heads, then, when (all of) you are about to look at the coin, should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  your subjective anticipation of seeing &quot;heads&quot; be 1:1 or 100:1?
</em><br>
<p>I wish to state more clearly the reasons why the answer should be
<br>
100:1, although let me hastily admit that this is trickier than I thought.
<br>
<p>My new approach is to revert to the Many Worlds Interpretation
<br>
for clarity. I hope it makes understandable what I was saying 
<br>
before. The answer that emerges should be the same as using
<br>
any of the other interpretations.
<br>
<p>Let me break down the steps which discretely occur, to help
<br>
expose any invalid assumptions.
<br>
<p>A. A fair coin is flipped and some process notes the outcome.
<br>
B. If the result is tails, nothing further happens.
<br>
C. If the result is heads, 100 separated isomorphic copies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a person are created.
<br>
D. Each copy in any universe only then examines the coin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see what turned up
<br>
<p>What is the &quot;subjective anticipation&quot; that it will be heads?
<br>
(where I read that as &quot;subjective probability&quot;).
<br>
<p>If this all began in a Group of Identical Universes (a term often
<br>
used by Deutsch in &quot;The Fabric of Reality&quot;), then just after
<br>
the flip, the GIU splits into two, one universe called H and one
<br>
called T, each with a probability of .5 relative to the original GIU.
<br>
<p>Next, in universe H the person's measure is multiplied by 100.
<br>
<p>So how do we answer the question, &quot;What is the person's
<br>
subjective probability of seeing an H now?&quot;.  Well, each
<br>
different instance of the person has the same measure, since
<br>
in T no duplication occurred. That is, each of the 101 copies,
<br>
from the multiverse perspective, has the same salience, the
<br>
same measure. In other words, you get 100 times the
<br>
runtime in H as you do in T.
<br>
<p>Therefore on this account, your subjective probability, sampled
<br>
evenly over the multiverse, is 100:1 that you will now see a &quot;head&quot;.
<br>
<p>The Evolutionary Test
<br>
<p>Let's put this to the test I mentioned before, and check the result
<br>
by evolutionary logic.
<br>
<p>You are furthermore required on each day that the coin is flipped
<br>
to undergo a 100/101 probability of dying (that is, the instance of
<br>
you perishing). This applies equally to all copies of you. I now
<br>
switch to the language of probability, though it would be possible,
<br>
but more cumbersome to stick with branching.
<br>
<p>Consider the case now after five days have passed. We compute
<br>
that the expectation is that just one of you will still be alive, because
<br>
every day 100/101 are eliminated, whether or not they saw an H or a T.
<br>
<p>What will this one remember?  It's possible that he will remember
<br>
TTTTT, but that is very unlikely. That would only occur if each
<br>
day the 100/101 death toll struck only those who had received
<br>
&quot;heads&quot;. The chances are (100/101)^5, which is close to .95,
<br>
that he would remember HHHHH.
<br>
<p>And if this continues, then a &quot;T&quot; will crop up in a long sequence
<br>
of mostly H's about one time in one hundred and one.
<br>
<p>Therefore, as before, the subjective probability is 100/101
<br>
that on each trial you'll see an H.
<br>
