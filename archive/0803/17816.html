<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; So if two computers implement Monday and Tuesday in isolation from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; each other, i.e. purely by chance, there *won't* be subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; continuity between them, while if two similar computers implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Monday and Tuesday in a similar way, except the programmer set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Tuesday having knowledge of Monday, there *will* be subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; continuity between them? How is this discrepancy possible, if mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; states supervene on physical states?
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry, everyone!  The programmer *did* convey the
<br>
causal information from the end of Monday's run to the
<br>
beginning of Tuesday's run.   I was thinking of, like, dust
<br>
in space where the state of a patch of dust near the Virgo
<br>
cluster (over a few light years in extent) is not conveyed
<br>
to a state near the Andromeda galaxy. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Oh, all of Monday will be filled with bonafide conscious experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of all entities lucky enough to be emulated, and so will Tuesday,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  But there will be no causal information flow between them, so for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  one instant between Monday 24:59:59.999... and Tuesday 12:00.00
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  information flow will not exist. But the internal observers, of course,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  will lose almost nothing. This is not the case with dust between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  stars, since no causal information flow connects any two instants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But somewhere in the dust is the transition from moment 0 to moment 1,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhere is the transition from moment 1 to moment 2, ..., so every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transition is computed even though it's not the &quot;same&quot; state 1 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between those two computations (or it is the same, but with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different physical implementation).
</em><br>
<p>A given patch of intergalactic dust (say a tenth of a light year wide) 
<br>
at one instant is isomorphic to my brain state. Some time later (or
<br>
even earlier) another vastly removed patch of dust is isomorphic
<br>
to my brain state as it is an instant later.  I meant to say that between
<br>
these two patches no information actually flew. (It would have 
<br>
probably required FasterThanLight, at least.)
<br>
<p>Or do you mean to say that *somewhere* the dust actually &quot;computes&quot;
<br>
for a tiny microsecond, and is isomorphic to the changes in my brain
<br>
over that microsecond, and then a second place, the computation is
<br>
taken from state 2 to state 3?  If so, these breaks that occur happen
<br>
almost continually, and prevent ongoing information flow. But perhaps
<br>
I'm not understanding you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, I don't see that you could notice the lack of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flow. Since (if) the mental supervenes on the physical, then for there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a noticeable difference the computation would have to come out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently depending on the causal history of the initial state, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrant absurdity.
</em><br>
<p>Surely you don't believe that one patch of dust relays information to
<br>
another patch of dust many, many light years away?  But we may
<br>
simply be miscommunicating.  Can you clarify, please?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
