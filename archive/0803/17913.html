<p>Is every memory required for your sense of self?  When you wake each day, do
<br>
you consult some checksum that verifies the integrity of your memory to
<br>
date?  Could you temporarily be unable to recall the details of your 10th
<br>
birthday, yet still believe yourself to be the same person who does remember
<br>
their birthday?  Suppose those hundred copies each received 1/100th of the
<br>
memories to the point of copying, would any of them believe themselves to be
<br>
you?  Would their subjective sense of identity be comparably diminished one
<br>
hundred fold?  What about only 2 copies, one with all your memories/skills
<br>
for work and the other with skills uniquely allocated for relaxation and
<br>
enjoyment:  Each is run in a microcosm matched to their purpose.  After some
<br>
interval of subjective experience, the two copies are merged back together.
<br>
Is the resulting whole more or less than the sum of their work and rest
<br>
lives?
<br>
<p><p>A sound wave travels through air much faster than individual air particles
<br>
can move.  Using this particle analogy to understand subjective units of
<br>
space-time/experience, is identity/self the wave that moves through this
<br>
medium?  (If not sound&amp;air, use light&amp;vacuum, etc.)
