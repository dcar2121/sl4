<p>
<em>&gt; If I understand Mark's proposal (which he claims I don't), it is that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group of agents that cooperate with each other have greater fitness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a group of agents that fight among themselves.  On this point I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree, but it defines Friendliness very broadly.  Humans have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special status.  I described on the AGI list a possible outcome where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Earth is transformed into a Dyson sphere of gray goo devoid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA based life.  According to Mark's definition, this outcome is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly because the nanobots are cooperating.  He at least did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not post any objection.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry.  I didn't see this before and I'm posting an objection now.  The 
<br>
nanobots *are* cooperating with each other but they are stomping all over 
<br>
humanity.  That is UnFriendly in exactly the same sense that humans 
<br>
terraforming another world with a native sentient species would be extremely 
<br>
unFriendly on the part of the humans. Humans have no special status.  They 
<br>
should not be stomped on.  They should also be not be stomping on others.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not my objection either.  (The nanobots are achieving their goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and since nothing else is alive, their opinions are the only ones that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter).
</em><br>
<p>If the humans were dead or have moved before they started, then I agree with 
<br>
you.  If not, I violently disagree with you unless the humans voluntarily 
<br>
agree to move or be destroyed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My objection is that evolution is not a stable process.  It lies on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; border between stability and chaos.  It is punctuated by mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinctions, plagues, and other catastrophes.  A state where there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no competition is the worst kind of catastrophe.
</em><br>
<p>I can agree with that but only because I don't believe that there is *ever* 
<br>
a state where there is no competition at some level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without competition between groups (e.g. wars), there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no evolutionary pressure to maintain goals that promote group survival.
</em><br>
<p>And this is where we currently have a fundamental disagreement, I am 
<br>
contending that the competition at lower levels or the competition against 
<br>
the environment (and, as long as your goals aren't fulfilled, you *ARE* 
<br>
competing against your environment to fulfilll them) *IS* sufficient 
<br>
pressure to maintain the goal of survival for the competing lower-level 
<br>
entity which then trickles up to group survival.  Also, if the group is 
<br>
self-improving and has any goals, it will then the Omohundro drive for 
<br>
self-preservation.
