<p>You can only experience being a single person at the one time: there
<br>
is no magical process telling you that there are 100 other copies of
<br>
you or what those copies are up to. However, the illusion of a mind
<br>
flitting from one copy to another is created by the fact that although
<br>
you definitely know who you *are* you can't know who you *were*. A
<br>
particular CD you hold in your hand is a single concrete instance of
<br>
stored information, but there is no way to tell that the information
<br>
came from one hard disk or another, if both of the hard disks had the
<br>
same information. This means that if there are 101 identical copies,
<br>
you are definitely only one of those copies now, but in the next
<br>
moment you could be any one of the copies (including the present one)
<br>
whose experience is consistent with the information in your present
<br>
copy being in their subjective past. If this next moment involves
<br>
opening the envelope, you will end up finding that you are one (and
<br>
only one) of the 100 copies that reads &quot;no torture&quot; or the single copy
<br>
that reads &quot;torture&quot;. So you are 100 times as likely to read &quot;no
<br>
torture&quot;.
