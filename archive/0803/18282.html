</em><br>
<p><p>Why would they do it secretly?  At least in the US, the Department of

Defense can walk off with intellectual property like this *legally*,  
<br>
which has always been the case as far as I know.  I am pretty sure  
<br>
that is true in most other countries as well. And they might even pay  
<br>
another defense contractor to turn it into a usable implementation.   
<br>
Usually they play nice and ask for permission, possibly with  
<br>
compensation, as a matter of form -- they might even pay you to turn  
<br>
it into what they want -- but you have no recourse if you say no and  
<br>
they take your technology anyway.
<br>
<p>As such things go, DARPA is essentially benign.

<p><p>Do you understand the failure modes, as it would appear from your

<p><p>Yes, this is like arguing over how you are going to spend the money if

you win the lottery.
