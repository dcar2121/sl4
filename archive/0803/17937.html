<p>It's very difficult to even define what counts as a causal link.

Suppose you're in charge of the Tuesday computer and your friend gives
<br>
you two files, one of which is Sj from the end of the Monday computer
<br>
run while the other is not. If you input one of the files at random
<br>
and it turns out to be Sj, does that count as a causal link? What if
<br>
you input both files on two separate runs, knowing that one of them
<br>
has to be Sj? What if your friend tells you which is the correct file,
<br>
but you know that he's sometimes a bit of a joker?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  To take a more extreme case, suppose again that the last seven

<p>Well, you *could* say that there is something fundamentally
<br>
non-computable about the brain. That would solve all the problems,
<br>
wouldn't it? Patching up functionalism so that it doesn't lead to
<br>
apparently absurd conclusions (even though these conclusions may still
<br>
be compatible with observed reality) sounds to me a bit like patching
<br>
up quantum theory with &quot;wave function collapse&quot; in order to avoid the
<br>
apparent absurdity of the MWI.
