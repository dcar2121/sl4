Interesting discussion. Some updates: According to S. Hagan et al [1],
<br>
&quot;Tegmark considers in his paper two different scales at which quantum
<br>
computation might occur in the brain--one involving superpositions of
<br>
neurons firing and not firing (with calculated decoherence times of 10^-20
<br>
s), and another involving microtubules (calculated decoherence times of
<br>
10^-13 s). We agree that superpositions at the level of neural firing are
<br>
unlikely, and in fact play no role in the orch. OR or any other contemporary
<br>
quantum model. In the orch. OR approach, neural firings are entirely
<br>
classical, though they may be initiated by the outputs of microtubule
<br>
quantum processes in the neuronal interior. We therefore focus our attention
<br>
on Tegmark's assertions regarding decoherence times for
<br>
microtubule-associated quantum superpositions....Recalculation after
<br>
correcting for differences between the model on which Tegmark bases his
<br>
calculations and the orch. OR model (superposition separation, charge vs
<br>
dipole, dielectric constant) lengthens the decoherence time to 10^5 to 10^-4
<br>
s;; decoherence times on this order invalidate the assumptions of the
<br>
derivation and determine the approximation regime considered by Tegmark to
<br>
be inappropriate to the orch. OR superposition.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Hameroff expands on this in a chapter in a recent book, The Emerging Physics
<br>
of Consciousness [2]. As I have noted in Kurzweil Accelerating Intelligence
<br>
News [3], &quot;A new experiment has come close to detecting quantum effects in a
<br>
macroscopic object. NSA physicists have measured the vibrations of a tiny
<br>
nanoelectromechanical arm [mass of 10^-16 kg] to probe the limits at which
<br>
quantum behavior breaks down and classical physics takes over...&quot; [4] 
<br>
<p>Another interesting hypothesis for neural computations involves microtubule
<br>
tubulin dimers, which, according to my co-inventor Jack Tuszynski (prof. of
<br>
physics, U of Alberta and editor of The Emerging Physics of Consciousness
<br>
[5]), are thought to operate at 10^27 operations per second in an entire
<br>
brain (compared to 10^16 to 10^18 in other models). I'm in ongoing
<br>
discussions with Hameroff, Tuszynski (prof. of physics, U of Alberta),
<br>
Tegmark, and others for an article on this subject and I welcome all ideas.

<br>
feasibility. S. Hagan,. 1. S. R. Hameroff,. 2. and J. A. Tuszynski, Physical
<br>
Reviews E, 65: 061901, 2002.
<br>
<p>[2] J. A. Tuszynski (Ed.), The Emerging Physics of Consciousness, Springer,
<br>
2006. From the introductory chapter by Tuszynski and Woolf: &quot;Penrose and
<br>
Hameroff (1996) have put forth a highly disputed model of consciousness
<br>
based on quantum computation in microtubules within the brain's neurons.
<br>
This and other quantum models elucidate a number of enigmatic features of
<br>
consciousness; however, a few hurdles remain in establishing their
<br>
likelihood. Some of these difficulties are identified when designing
<br>
prototype quantum computers. One such obstacle is that quantum computers
<br>
will require a high degree of isolation from decoherence effects of the
<br>
local environment, or alternatively some kind of fault-tolerant architecture
<br>
that permits delicate quantum computing in the presence of realistic levels
<br>
of decoherence (Knill, 2005). The brain operates at body temperature, its
<br>
mass comprises 60 percent water, and is electromagnetically, chemically and
<br>
mechanically noisy, all of which would seem to severely shorten the time
<br>
allowed for quantum computation. Long-lasting, large-scale quantum states
<br>
are deemed to be impossible in the brain because a single ion, photon, or
<br>
thermal vibration can cause decoherence and hence random reduction to
<br>
classical states. On the other hand, proponents of a quantum approach to
<br>
consciousness point to a number of physical mechanisms in the brain that may
<br>
lengthen the time of quantum coherence and provide necessary quantum
<br>
isolation. Firstly, microtubules may be able to perform quantum computations
<br>
at room temperature because basic maintenance of microtubules is energy
<br>
dependent resulting in energy being continuously pumped in and out. This
<br>
situation is analogous to that of lasers, which work accordingly to quantum
<br>
optical principles at room temperature (see Hagan et al., 2002; Mershin et
<br>
al., 2004a). Secondly, the water of hydration surrounding microtubules
<br>
appears to be in an ordered state, which decreases noise (Hagan et al.,
<br>
2002). Thirdly, topological error correction (in a manner similar to that of
<br>
the fault-tolerant architecture described above) may protect delicate
<br>
quantum states (Hagan et al., 2002).&quot;

<p>[5] From J. A. Tuszynski (Ed.), The Emerging Physics of Consciousness:
<br>
&quot;There are on the order of 10^4 synapses per large neuron, which switch
<br>
their states at a rate of some 10^3 switches per second, so that we arrive
<br>
at a number of ~10^18 operations per second in the brain on average. While
<br>
this is a truly huge number, it may pale by comparison with the yield given
<br>
by the brain if neuronal microtubules were actively involved in
<br>
computational processes. Consider that at the cytoskeletal level there are
<br>
roughly 10^7 microtubule tubulin dimers in each neuron which can switch
<br>
their conformational states on the order of nanoseconds resulting in on the
<br>
order of 10^16 operations per second per neuron or 10^27 operations per
<br>
second in an entire brain instead of 10^18 operations per second estimated
<br>
for the coarse-grained approach where neurons are taken as the smallest
<br>
computational units. Moreover, if each tubulin dimer does function as a
<br>
qubit and not a classical bit processor, then the computational power
<br>
becomes almost unimaginably vast. It has been claimed that as few as 300
<br>
qubits have the same computational power as a hypothetical classical
<br>
computer comprised of as many processing units as there are particles in the
<br>
universe.&quot;
