<em>&gt; &gt; The point, I think, is that it seems like there should be an objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact of the matter as to whether some physical system is having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conscious experiences;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>I dont know if its that simple.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but if computation is sufficient for experience, since what a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; system is computing is subjective, this can't be the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, why not?  Perhaps there is a terminological problem here, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the physical system in question, of course the computation yields
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (subjective) experience.  What a system is computing is objective,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally, but the &quot;consciousness&quot; experienced, that old murky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, &quot;as seen from inside&quot; by a device is all that is subjective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<p><p>Why is whether something has experience or not even relevant? I don't
<br>
immediately know if any of you have conscious experience, but you'd pass a
<br>
turing test if I gave you one. Although that wouldnt tell me if you're
<br>
really conscious, its 'good enough' so to speak.
<br>
<p>It doesnt mean we can't revise the criteria of the test, but theres never
<br>
'proof' that another entity is conscious. its not an argument that can be
<br>
resolved.
<br>
<p>At any rate, the observation of output from a system that may or may not be
<br>
conscious may or may not be opaque. Thats perhaps a better avenue to think
<br>
about. The output of our own cognitive processes, (this email) is
<br>
transparent (I hope) to most of you-- why not, we have similar cognitive
<br>
architectures.  The output of an arbitrary computer program built by a human
<br>
is opaque to some, transparent to some. This is also to be expected.  The
<br>
output of a system that is another step removed would be more opaque, but
<br>
this is not to say it wouldnt be systematic or exhibit qualities of
<br>
intelligence if it was the byproduct of a reasoning system.
<br>
<p>I personally think it will be glaringly obvious when we succeed in creating
<br>
an actual conscious entity. For the above reasons. The higher-order
<br>
organization and complexity we see in human behaviour, for example, is not
<br>
deduceable or even obviously related to the behaviour of a single neuron,
<br>
our low-level machine code, so to speak, is still not well understood. Yet
<br>
the higher-order level at which we interface with the world around us can be
<br>
much more isomorphic with our own experience. Obviously this is to be
<br>
expected, but at the same time, if we compare our own higher level
<br>
organization with that of an insect, which is of a fundamentally different
<br>
architecture, or even a bacterium, which is significantly more so, we see a
<br>
good deal of emergent similarities based on function, although we still dont
<br>
know what type of fundamental experience an insect or a bacterium has. This
<br>
is the kind of thing I think we need to watch for as evidence of
<br>
consciousness.
