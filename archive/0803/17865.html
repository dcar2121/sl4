<em>&gt; &gt; You're using faulty terminology to gain psychological advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for your faulty assertion. (&quot;One of them is going to shortly die&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implies death of a self in this context, which really isn't the case
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; here; see further down.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely we agree that there is a death of an instance at stake
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my scenario, and by that I mean that the normal idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the two physically running processes being destroyed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That wording should have been clear, I claim.
</em><br>
<p>I took &quot;death&quot; to imply that something dramatic happens, a person, a
<br>
viewpoint, a self is destroyed. But sure, if we use &quot;death&quot; in the
<br>
cavalier way that me going kill -9 18975 results in a death of a
<br>
particular task on my computer, there is death involved here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We quite agree there, though perhaps for different reasons. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My reason is that more &quot;total benefit&quot; per hour of life accrues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the person I am, the more places and oftener I get to run.
</em><br>
<p>Can't argue with value judgements, but I find this extremely silly,
<br>
bordering on metaphysical (considering it's just not observable to the
<br>
subject how many times it's run in an identical manner). But hey, I'm
<br>
sure even putting oneself into a Permutation Cityesque loop (IIRC it was
<br>
an infinite climbing scenario) will prove popular with some folk, if at
<br>
all feasible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; An sich [As such] I see no reason to fret over one instance terminating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Didn't you just say &quot;certainly it matters in that there'd be one less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance of me&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>But not _as such_; merely because it affects potentials, such as my
<br>
survival _in the case_ that the others fail as well. If there's zero
<br>
instances of me around in our shared reality I quite likely die, or at
<br>
the very least lose contact with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doesn't it have to be entirely a matter of degree, a slow change?
</em><br>
<p>Possibly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Myself, I would claim that given enough time they'll probably become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate people, just as you and a copy of you living in different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cities would eventually over perhaps many decades become 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different people.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>Oh, by the way, since Heartland's post really doesn't warrant a reply of
<br>
its own, I'll stick a short retort here, in the spirit of the quality of
<br>
his argumentation: &quot;Yo momma was fat in the past and will be so in the
<br>
future.&quot;
<br>
<p>To be a bit more constructive though, it should strike one as odd that
<br>
people hold on to philosophies of the self that are what you'd expect
<br>
from an evolved ape but break down into huge irreconciliable
<br>
complications with the tiniest bit of nudging, while complaining that
<br>
better thought out and more robust philosophies are merely &quot;convenient&quot;
<br>
because they happen to not have the same problems as theirs. Hope this
<br>
helps.
