<p><em>&gt;&gt; Okay, so, after I all see the coin - in an algorithmically isomorphic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  way - merge my separated copies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Oh, look, by briefly expending a bit of extra computing power, I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  control the outcome of coinflips - though not in a way that any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  watcher would detect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem has to do with the fact that we believe there is one, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only one, version of us that persists through time. This is shown to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be objectively false when multiple copies are involved, but our minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to interpret the situation as if it's true.
</em><br>
<p>That indeed could be one of the sources of the problem or the main source.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fact, it isn't even true if there is only one copy: why should I care
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the experiences of some guy who will wake up in my bed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow and think he's me, let alone some guy who wakes up as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an upload and thinks he's me?
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course, because you are the same person you were yesterday,
<br>
and, barring extreme thought experiments, surgery, or very weird
<br>
experiences, the same person you'll be tomorrow. Objectively speaking,
<br>
there are a huge number of different ways that you could wake up in
<br>
your bed tomorrow---e.g., whether or not the phone rings between
<br>
now and then, whether you hear a bus go by, whether there is an
<br>
earthquake and you are thrown out of bed for a while, whether the
<br>
police accidentally arrest the wrong person and you spend hours 
<br>
down at the station explaining, etc.  In all these cases, who you
<br>
are is not affected.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So-called paradoxes of personal identity are due to the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought experiments such as these screw with our psychology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Physics and logic remain unaffected.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with that---but these thought experiments also revolve around
<br>
the concept of what a person is, the nature of anticipation, and, (as
<br>
you imply) mistakes we make due to looking at some things subjectively
<br>
which can perfectly well be approached objectively.
