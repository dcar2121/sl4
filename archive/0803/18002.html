<p><em>&gt; The Friendliness Declaration
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi, I'm Mark Waser.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am hereby declaring myself to be a Friendly entity as of March 12, 2008.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I have not knowingly/intentionally performed any UnFriendly actions since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this date.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not previously been declared UnFriendly by any declared Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity.    I have not been requested to put any disputed actions or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unintentional UnFriendly actions in this declaration by any declared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am Mike.  I declare myself to be Friendly.  (Yes, that's a completely
<br>
ambiguous term, but I know it means when I declare it)  I deem Mark Waser's
<br>
declaration of Friendly to be hostile to my own definition of Friendly and
<br>
therefor declare him to be UnFriendly.  (again, I'm not sure what exactly
<br>
Mark means by his use of the term or the significance of camelCase used
<br>
thereupon)  I hereby request a dispute resolution clause be added to the
<br>
Mark's declaration of March 12, 2008 and further declare that the now
<br>
defunct declaration no longer be declared.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Do not act contrary to someone's/anyone's goals unless absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary for the fulfillment of a reasonable/rational personal goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (explicitly not including generic sub-goals like money, power, pleasure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religion, etc.)
</em><br>
<p><p>I am acting contrary to Mark's goals of declaring a state of Friendly for my
<br>
own reasonable personal goal of illustrating the point that it's not so
<br>
simple to generally define Friendly.
<br>
<p>I am voluntarily undertaking the goal of spreading Friendliness and
<br>
<em>&gt; assigning it a reasonable priority (i.e. enough to be a net asset to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly Society) because I understand that doing so is in my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest.
</em><br>
<p><p>&quot;My own self-interest&quot; is of no concern regarding Friendly Society.  You
<br>
will be assimilated.  Resistance is a value of indeterminate measure and
<br>
continues to be measured.
<br>
<p>I will act in accordance with these goals according to the rules/laws of a
<br>
<em>&gt; Friendly Society included in this declaration.  I understand that if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowingly and intentionally act contrary to these rules/laws that I can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declared UnFriendly and will need to make another declaration of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness including information about the most recent times that I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been declared UnFriendly.
</em><br>
<p><p>Won't that turn into a series of &quot;Hi my name is... and I've been Friendly
<br>
for 2 whole days now....&quot; at the beginning of every Friendly Society
<br>
Anonymous meeting?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I understand that the rules/laws of a Friendly Society include the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirement that all statements in this declaration be truthful under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penalty of having this declaration declared null and void and my being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declared UnFriendly for attempting to impersonate a Friendly entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In particular, I understand that hiding or lying about any UnFriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions (even if unintentionally or unknowingly performed) is contrary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rules/laws of a Friendly Society.  I understand that while I may defend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself against unfair charges of UnFriendly actions, I must admit to all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UnFriendly actions (even if unknowingly and/or intentionally performed) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must include all disputed charges in this declaration as requested for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable length of time or risk having this declaration declared null and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; void and my being declared UnFriendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that the rules/laws of Friendly Society state that declaring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another entity UnFriendly is, in itself, UnFriendly unless there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable cause for doing so, I have executed a reasonable due process, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am sure beyond reasonable doubt.  I understand that the rules/laws further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; require that I retract any declarations of UnFriendliness if *any*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable doubt subsequently arises and I must volunteer my most recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retractions of UnFriendliness declarations (if any) when asked and in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subsequent UnFriendliness declarations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ok,. you got me.  I'm no longer sure if I am in Fact Friendly or only
<br>
Believe myself to be Friendly or alternatively FriEndly.  I concede that I
<br>
have made both Friendly and UnFriendly declarations in the name of
<br>
Friendliness and must (under the rules presented so far) demand that you
<br>
retract your declaration of Friendly and simultaneously retract my own.  I
<br>
believe we have both been UnFriendly in our efforts to pursue a state of
<br>
Friendly.
