<p><em>&gt; I understand there may be value in retaining atomic details of every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transaction.  The transaction record may be later mined for further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns that were not observed from an initial investigation.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I offer this scenario:  Your wife asks how your day was.  You say, &quot;It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was fine&quot; (because you really don't care to relive your day to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the details)  You then realize that what she was really asking was,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Are you going to ask me about MY day&quot; so you reciprocate with, &quot;And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how was your day?&quot;  Now tell me, what amount of data do you record
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the next 20 minutes of downloading she attempts to convey?
</em><br>
<p>Depends (a) on the relationship (b) the wife's voice qualities (some gifted
<br>
talk show hosts have somehow such compelling voice qualities that you
<br>
would not find them reading the phone book out loud to be all that
<br>
boring)  (c) just how good your own verbal memory is.  Of course,
<br>
I'm probably taking your question too literally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe you would in-principle say that you have recorded every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuance of that 20 minutes.
</em><br>
<p>Few people would or should make that claim. But then, what you
<br>
are trying to explain is what the &quot;nuances&quot; really amount to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the physical universe real-time has an effectively unlimited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution and bandwidth (granted: a debatable assumption)
</em><br>
<p>You bet it's debatable, what with QM and the Bekenstein bound.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You face death of your human body.
</em><br>
<p>Now you've got my attention, and we may have just progressed
<br>
from SL2 to SL3  --- I hope Eliezer and the list snipers don't parse
<br>
for &quot; SL*  &quot;   :-)    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can be uploaded with the following limitation on technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bandwidth to memory is a fixed constant (let's say due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electromagnetic storage constraints).  However, the bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bringing data into your 'brain' can exceed the bandwidth to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory by several orders of magnitude (it's 100% optical)
</em><br>
<p>At least.  And though we are just discussing principle, there
<br>
are the other senses that should be given passing mention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you tune your input rate down in order to accurately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;remember&quot; everything you perceive?
</em><br>
<p>I'm missing what you are getting at with that question. Oh, on a
<br>
second re-reading, I get it.  That is, for example, do I squint so
<br>
that the incoming bandwidth isn't any greater than the bandwidth
<br>
to my memory? (There's another sentence that could have been
<br>
restated and embroidered with &quot;That is...&quot;, or &quot;In other words...&quot;
<br>
:-)  But I'm just on a kick right now of trying to make other
<br>
people's emails more accessible to me (e.g. so that I have
<br>
to make fewer conjectures as I read, and it's easier to confirm
<br>
the ones I do make), so forgive the stylistic lecture.)
<br>
<p>I can't remember ever doing that.  That is, I don't recall ever
<br>
turning down the volume of an incoming podcast to grok more
<br>
of it (unless, naturally, it's so loud that it's *preventing* information
<br>
flow), or trying to skim written material IN ORDER TO notice
<br>
less of it----ah!  Thanks!  Yes I do.  Often, especially with pages
<br>
I already read or which seem overly redundant I have found,
<br>
as per your prediction, that I can more accurately &quot;remember
<br>
what I perceive&quot;.
<br>
<p>But still, if I take your question above quite literally, the answer
<br>
still is no, I think. BTW, what has this to do with Memory
<br>
Merging Possible for Close Duplicates?
