<em>&gt;&gt; Oh?  Maybe I misunderstood.  Can we defer the extraordinarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  interesting, crucial, appalling, and mind-blowing case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;      Sa-&gt;Sb , Sc-&gt;Sd , Se-&gt;Sf , ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  until later?  As you can well anticipate, this make my claims even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  more unbelievable!  But I want to make sure, as you do, that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  have understood my claim up till now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The case I was thinking of is where the pairs overlap: Sa-&gt;Sb, Sb-&gt;Sc,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sc-&gt;Sd,... . It seems that you would allow this set of states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuous consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; I still haven't understood your position on information flow over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; noisy or unreliable channel. If two pieces of information are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; transferred, and it is known that one is correct and the other not, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; there an interruption in consciousness if the correct information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; used?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  No interruption.  Just like the sudden and miraculous appearance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of Sir Francis Bacon in an exact state that he really did occupy in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the 1600s. It really is him, and he didn't lose even an infinitesimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  bit of consciousness, because this is a case of  ...-&gt;Sd-&gt;Se-&gt;Sf...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in the 17th century followed by the sudden  Se-&gt;SF-&gt;SG-&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in the 20th century, where caps are used, partly, to indicate his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  astonishment!  Because Se really happened back then and Se
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  also happened in the 20th century, his consciousness was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  interrupted in the slightest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The operator of the first machine notes its final state, and transfers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this state plus another unrelated state to the operator of the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine - not telling him which is which. The second operator inputs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the states into his machine and it just happens to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct one, so no interruption in consciousness, right?
</em><br>
<p>Right.  So long as it's transferring the same state, e.g., &quot;Sn&quot; was
<br>
on the first machine (when it broke) and &quot;Sn&quot; is on the diskette
<br>
or CD that is used to transport the state to a new machine where
<br>
it can pick up the calculation uninterrupted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Whereas if he had input the wrong state a completely different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation would have resulted, so obviously total disruption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the stream of consciousness would have resulted).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, provided, indeed, that the latter computation is not similar
<br>
at all to the originally scheduled one.  For example, suppose
<br>
that my entire quantum state at a certain instant is Se, and
<br>
because a cosmic ray struck the diskette during transport,
<br>
a few bits were damaged, resulting in state Se'.  But e' is so
<br>
extraordinarily similar to Se, that it's still the same person
<br>
and still the same computation so far as I am concerned.
<br>
Naturally, as always, the infinitesimal difference will eventually
<br>
diverge the computation who knows how far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, suppose the first operator transfers the final state of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine *as well as* every other possible state, again not telling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is which, and the second operator just happens to choose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right state to input. Is there interruption of consciousness?
</em><br>
<p>No interruption.  The last state on the Australian machine is
<br>
identical to the first state on the Vienna machine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is information transfer of sorts in that the correct state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been taken off the first machine and is known to the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operator, but it is completely hidden in the noise. The first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operator may as well tell the second operator to try all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different states in turn.
</em><br>
<p>That'll really take the second operator and the Vienna computer
<br>
a lot of time and expense, but in principle, that's all, and that's
<br>
nothing worth noting in this discussion, to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you think there will be continuity of consciousness if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first operator tells the second operator to try each possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state in turn, but *not* if the second operator tries each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state in turn on his own initiative, without any communication
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the first machine?
</em><br>
<p>Each *possible* state?  That is, so that all of Se, Se', Se'', Se''',
<br>
Se'''', ..., Sj, Sj', Sj'', etc., etc. are tried?  I think that this is
<br>
indeed what you mean.  The continuity of consciousness 
<br>
will work for most of, I'll arbitrarily say, the Se, Se',...
<br>
sequence, where those sequences are about as different as
<br>
you are after being struck during some fraction of a micro-
<br>
second by a cosmic ray.
<br>
<p>Thanks much for your exceptionally clear probing of my
<br>
position.
<br>
<p>Lee
