</em><br>

<em>&gt; &quot;S=A/4 where A is the two-dimensional area of the black hole's event

<em>&gt; horizon in units of the Planck area, \hbar G/c^3.&quot;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can someone explain how a two dimensional area is used to measure the

<em>&gt; amount of information that can be stored in a 3 (or more) dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe?  (Or if this is too basic a question, simply email me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-list with some educational URLs)
</em><br>
<p>I had independently derived an order of magnitude estimate of the information
<br>
content of the universe a few years ago using a different approach.  I
<br>
estimated the number of possible standing wave patterns in a volume of size R
<br>
as a function of the mass-energy E = mc^2 in that space, which depends on
<br>
Planck's constant h.  Then I set R = Tc where T = 4.3 x 10^17 s is the age of
<br>
universe and c is the speed of light.  Then I estimated the largest mass that
<br>
could be contained in a sphere of radius R before the escape velocity reached
<br>
c (the Schwartzchild radius).  I came up with S ~ T^2 c^5/hG ~ 10^122 ignoring
<br>
small constants because the radius of the universe is not well defined in
<br>
expanding, curved spacetime, the exact mass of the universe isn't known, and I
<br>
don't have the physics background to compute the exact value anyway.
<br>
<p>I only recently came across the Bekenstein bound, which gives S = 2.02 x
<br>
10^122 if you let the surface of the universe be 4*pi*(Tc)^2.  Actually this
<br>
is 2.91 x 10^122 bits because thermodynamic entropy uses natural logs. 
<br>
Calculating with Bousso's figure of 1.4 x 10^69 bits/m^2 gives the same
<br>
result.
<br>
<p>It is rather interesting that the volume of a bit is about that of a proton or
<br>
neutron, but S does not depend on the properties of any particles.  Either
<br>
this is a coincidence or the size or number of baryons is changing because S
<br>
increases with T^2 while the volume increases with T^3.  There are about
<br>
S^(2/3) ~ 10^80 baryons in the universe, enough to make a coating one particle
<br>
thick.
<br>
<p>It has always puzzled me why the universe didn't collapse into a black hole
<br>
shortly after the big bang if it had the same mass as today.  It also puzzles
<br>
me that a black hole is not symmetric with respect to time (stuff goes in but
<br>
not out) even though Einstein's general field equations are.  Shouldn't there
<br>
be another solution with the opposite sign, one where stuff goes out but not
<br>
in, like an expanding universe?  In that case, dark energy is just gravity?
