<em>&gt;&gt;  Question:  would you prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (A)  to be tortured for an hour in the old-fashioned way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (B)  for records of such an hour merely to be retrieved from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        a galaxy far, far away a long time ago in which you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        tortured just the same, and merely the states for that hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        interval brought to Earth and at the proper moment merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        looked up?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; In that case, (A) and (B) would be equivalent.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From a philosophical point of view, I can see your point - but I'd
</em><br>
like to inject some practical caveats here. If I was given such a
<br>
choice, I would jump at (B) instantly. Partly because of anticipation
<br>
of pain (which is much more important to me right now than
<br>
anticipation of the end of pain).
<br>
<p>But mainly because if we tweak this example, we get highly
<br>
non-inuitive consequences. What about &quot;get tortured now, and left to
<br>
live for ten years while slowly recuperating&quot; vs &quot;in ten year's time,
<br>
have a distant memory of being tortured&quot;?
<br>
<p>Or &quot;having a terrible, painful nightmare, then waking up&quot; vs &quot;waking
<br>
up, with a vague fading memory that you had some unpleasant dream&quot;?
<br>
<p>The evolution of our memories - vivid events become less vivid,
<br>
sometimes get erased entirely - seems to militate against total
<br>
equivalence between &quot;C happened&quot; and &quot;everyone remembers that C
<br>
happened (but it didn't)&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You might think that it sounds reasonable, but ultimately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you have to take it on faith. You also have to admit that you might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  at least partially a zombie right now, since feeling that you're all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  conscious does not count as evidence that this is in fact the case.
</em><br>
<p>I'm feeling that Zombies should be denied their rations of brains, and
<br>
buried away from this list for ever. With no way of distinguishing a
<br>
zombie from a non-zombie, I don't see what the point of mentioning
<br>
them is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  to prior existing patterns existing only in Platonia.
</em><br>
<p>I plan to visit Platonia soon, and bring back some photos. Or at
<br>
least, the platonic ideal of photos.
<br>
