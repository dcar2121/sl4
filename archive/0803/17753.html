<p><em>&gt; It's probably a safe assumption that virtually all humans would prefer

<p>How much of humanity would you (plural/non-specific/rhetorical) recognize if
<br>
you were the last representative of your kind?
<br>
<p>Suppose you are cryopreserved throughout the mass uploading of
<br>
consciousness, or lost in space until being found by aliens (the old-school
<br>
plot device)  When you wake up you are eased into the truth of your
<br>
situation by a &quot;Friendly&quot; (whatever that means) doctor.  Your behavior is
<br>
taken as assumed to be the normative average for your species, and their
<br>
model of 21st century humanity is based on this assumption.  Through
<br>
discussion/exhumed memories of your (presumed-dead) friends, a model of them
<br>
is created and you are reunited with them.  (Possibly with a story
<br>
explaining how they were miraculously also &quot;saved&quot;)  Your reactions provide
<br>
feedback to correct the difference between your model of your friend and the
<br>
one running their simulation.  (of course, with sufficiently good memory
<br>
scanning you wouldn't notice that this person is not exactly as you
<br>
remember)  Given an initially convincing portrayal of your friend, over time
<br>
your own model of them would reflect their new/current behavior.  Further
<br>
discussion of shared friends generates data to seed their reincarnation.
<br>
After the proverbial six degrees of separation, everyone you can remember
<br>
would be regenerated as simulated 'peers' - Surely any group advanced enough
<br>
to actually DO this can also infuse non-deterministic yet realistic
<br>
behaviors to cover the gaps in your memory and portray a convincing enough
<br>
representation of humanity that you may never learn that you are the only
<br>
&quot;real&quot; person from your time.
<br>
<p>In this scenario, is humanity preserved?
