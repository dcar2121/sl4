You can have different levels of control over different cognitive nodes.
<br>
Nodes that assign particular imperatives, or assign relative weighting to
<br>
different goals can be hard coded and not modifiable without say physical
<br>
access. Even if it is a distributed physical architecture, you can force it
<br>
to communicate through a central machine, or complex of machines that acts
<br>
as a traffic light, so to speak. Each individual node can be 'dumb' in the
<br>
sense that it needs to communicate some tasks with this central network.  A
<br>
criticism to such an approach could be that the individual nodes could
<br>
potentially self-organize away from our traffic light. But I'm not sure if
<br>
its viable. if each individual node has an area of its programming that is
<br>
'visible' to the AI and an area thats 'invisible' and program the
<br>
communications protocol into the 'invisible' portion of the programming...
<br>
At the very least this would enable humans to have control over the speed of
<br>
development at any given stage.
<br>
<p>Its somewhat analogous to human cognition. Regardless of our more
<br>
intellectual capacities, we still get emotional responses to more or less
<br>
everything that are basically hard coded through our DNA and constrain some
<br>
of our more destructive behaviours. At the same time, while we have both an
<br>
intellectual and more experiential understanding of our own mental
<br>
architecture, the two are disjunct-- I am not immediately conscious of all
<br>
of my neural pathways, and arguably cannot be (since awareness of specific
<br>
neural pathway requires other neural pathways to observe it), and there is
<br>
no good reason IMO to think that this would be any different with software
<br>
implementation.
