<p><em>&gt;  &gt; You can go up as high as you feel is necessary. You suggested that a

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; might cause a small deficit in consciousness. If that's not enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; then imagine that half the Board is looked up and the other half
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; calculated: surely that should be noticeable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Noticeable to whom?  Here is what I think is going on: *naturally*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the subject, the person who's supposed to be having experiences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can report nothing different than what he would report anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  All the states that his brain would have reached (under what I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;totally authentic computation&quot;) would still be reached. So in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  certain sense, he *doesn't* notice any difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But in another sense he does.  But first, our entire hypothesis depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  on the agencies running the experiment to be perfectly aware of when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  his brain states are being looked up, and when they're being computed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by the usual routes of causality and local reductionism.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;But in another sense he does&quot;. I can see how you might say this if
<br>
there is a period of looked up computation (LUC) alternating with a
<br>
period of totally authentic computation (TAC): the person behaves
<br>
normally during the LUC, and during the period of TAC recalls the LUC
<br>
experiences, but these are actually false memories, as there were no
<br>
actual experiences during the LUC.
<br>
<p>However, the case I was considering was where the TAC and LUC are
<br>
occurring simultaneously, in the two halves of the GOL board. This
<br>
might result in, say, zombie vision but normal hearing, or zombie
<br>
aesthetic appreciation but normal arithmetical ability. If you were
<br>
100% zombie no external observer would know but you would (in a sense)
<br>
know, since you would not be having experiences. But is it possible
<br>
that your brain is partly zombified right now, with the normal,
<br>
conscious part systematically deluded into thinking that it can see
<br>
when in fact it is completely blind?
<br>
<p>If you allow the possibility of partial zombification then you have to
<br>
allow that not only can an external observer never know a person's
<br>
subjective experiences, but the person himself can never be sure that
<br>
he is having the experiences he believes he is having. This seems a
<br>
high price to pay in order to maintain that a LUC cannot be conscious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Now, let me phrase my answer using an experiment so that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  no mistaking my meaning.  Question:  would you prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (A)  to be tortured for an hour in the old-fashioned way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (B)  for records of such an hour merely to be retrieved from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        a galaxy far, far away a long time ago in which you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        tortured just the same, and merely the states for that hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        interval brough to Earth and at the proper moment merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        looked up?
</em><br>
<p>I guess it depends on whether the looking up of the records repeats
<br>
the experience which is what we are debating. If the recording were
<br>
accurate down to the atomic level then yes, I think it would reproduce
<br>
the same experience as the original.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; The only (naturalistic) way to avoid this conclusion is if the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; contains fundamentally non-computable physics, and there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; evidence that it does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just so. I would be surprised if this were at all controversial between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you and me, or between us and our favorite correspondents.
</em><br>
<p>The argument above proves that a functionally perfect simulation of a
<br>
brain must be as conscious as the brain *unless* partial zombification
<br>
is possible. The possibility of mind uploading is something else you
<br>
might have to give up if a LUC cannot be conscious.
