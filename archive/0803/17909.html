Stathis writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  In your very appropriate terminology Monday = {Si...Sj} and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Tuesday = {Sm...Sn}, but while S(j-1)-&gt;Sj is characterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  by information flow, that's not true of Sj -&gt;Sm, unless either
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  j = m (as in one of your hypotheses), or somehow Sm really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is computed someway from Sj.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand what you're saying, but how could the machine &quot;know&quot; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sj -&gt;Sm is the result of an operator who is aware of what he is doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a child that just happens to twiddle the right knobs?
</em><br>
<p>Exactly to the point!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A central idea in the theory of computation is that the substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and mechanics of its implementation is irrelevant.
</em><br>
<p>I'll leave it to you and others to judge how severely I'm challenging
<br>
this thesis. In your lovely Monday/Tuesday 48-hour computation of
<br>
an entity's consciousness, indeed, just how important is the way 
<br>
that Sm (the first state of Tuesday) has come to &quot;depend&quot; on the
<br>
last state of the Monday computation Sj?
<br>
<p>Again, I submit that there must be a *causal* connection between
<br>
Sj and its successor Sm, and that it be a *calculation*, i.e., that
<br>
Sm be *computed* from Sj.  And that if Sj arises solely by chance
<br>
(or a child twiddly knobs) then it is not a bonafide computation.
<br>
<p>To take a more extreme case, suppose again that the last seven
<br>
minutes of Monday had suffered just this same lack of what I
<br>
call bonafide computation, and that all the states of those seven
<br>
minutes had arisen strictly by chance. Then we begin the inevitable
<br>
downward spiral (e.g. see &quot;The Story of a Brain&quot; in Hofstadter
<br>
and Dennett's &quot;The Mind's I&quot;).  I say that it leads to ABSURDITY,
<br>
and the weak point in the chain MUST be this point at which,
<br>
as I say, &quot;no actual computing is done&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you drop that idea you may as well say that only brand name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neurons are capable of consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't need to go that far!  :-)    My target is merely rocks
<br>
being conscious, or patches of dust between here and the Hyades
<br>
supercluster being 0.99999999999 of Stathis's experience in life.
