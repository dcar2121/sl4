</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the GLUT would not be a zombie. Besides, a real live GLUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of passing a Turing test would fulfil your requirements for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time-dependent information flow. On what basis would you say it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious?
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe that a lookup table can implement consciousness,
<br>
because no true, reductionistic, locally-variable calculations 
<br>
performing information flow ever occur in a device using it.
<br>
<p>For ease of description together with good mental imagery,
<br>
let's revert to that greatest of all instruments for discussing so 
<br>
many things:  the very, very large Life Board.  With you and
<br>
perhaps many readers, it will be taken for granted that the
<br>
Rules of Conway's Life support consciousness, and even
<br>
civilizations on a large enough Life Board.
<br>
<p>Each subsequent generation (i.e. state) is computed from the last
<br>
generation, and is done so both *locally* and *reductionistically*.
<br>
The term means &quot;a small change locally has no global consequences,
<br>
at least not right away&quot;. The latter term means that any phenomenon
<br>
on the Life Board is &quot;merely&quot; the consequence of vastly many 
<br>
tinier calculations, just as in determinism in physics we suppose that
<br>
a tree is &quot;merely&quot; the summed behavior of myriad atoms and molecules.
<br>
<p>Now then. Suppose that five minutes of someone's life is implemented
<br>
on the very, very large Life Board. Suppose that this five minutes of
<br>
experience requires 10^50 generations, just to pick a number out of
<br>
the air. Each generation, or state, is completely dependent on just
<br>
the prior state, or, as you would write, St -&gt; Su (I like your brief
<br>
alphabetical indication of subsequent states following causally from
<br>
earlier ones) where (t, u) is simply any pair of adjacent letters in our
<br>
alphabet.
<br>
<p>However, a GLUT (Giant LookUp Table) is neither locally computed
<br>
nor reductionistic. Here is how the GLUT could work. Let Sa be the
<br>
first state (generation) of the person's five minute experience. Then,
<br>
instead of Sb obtaining from streams of gliders and glider/spaceship
<br>
logic and so forth, Sb is *merely* looked up in some vast database
<br>
as follows.  The entire Life Board, from the top row (1,1), (1,2), (1,3),
<br>
(1,4), .... consists of pixels either on (1) or off (0).  So the first four
<br>
pixels could be 0110, 1010, or any other four bits.  For the entire
<br>
Life Board, then a generation is an immense bit string, e.g.,
<br>
011011001010000011...
<br>
<p>Next, we perform a seemingly irrelevant step: the string is hashed
<br>
by a one-to-one algorithm into some other string of bits. See
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function</a> .
<br>
This step destroys the &quot;locality&quot;, i.e., as above, one small pixel
<br>
change on the board will now cause a totally different output
<br>
from the perfect hash function.
<br>
<p>This new string is then used as an address to fetch the next state from
<br>
the GLUT.  *Whatever* is at the hash of  011011001010000011...,
<br>
used as an address, is loaded onto the Life Board. But you see, there
<br>
really is no calculation!  No small streams of gliders send signals from
<br>
one &quot;organ&quot; to another, no local group of pixels causally evolves.
<br>
The &quot;next state&quot; is now thus perfectly arbitrary in a sense.
<br>
<p>You might as well have a succession of frozen states, each actually
<br>
having no intrinsic connection with the rest (for an intuitive description
<br>
of &quot;The Problem of the Succession of Frozen States&quot;, see
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/SFS.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/SFS.html</a>).
<br>
<p>Of course this reduces to the problem of &quot;The Theory of Dust&quot;, and
<br>
we are right back to wondering how a pattern found in one cubic
<br>
lightyear of dust, that appears to be Sa, could really be connected
<br>
in any meaningful way with another pattern found in another cubic
<br>
lightyear 10,000,000 parsecs away.  Again, I just don't think that
<br>
all those patches of dust constitute consciousness (no information
<br>
flow, no time involved).  A perfectly consistent position for a
<br>
time chauvinist like me.
<br>
<p><p>Thus, so far we have a GLUT that perfectly simulates (but not
<br>
emulates) a given person for a five minute stretch of his life. It
<br>
*simulates* his life because it only appears to be a conscious
<br>
run. As I've in essence argued above, this run is no more conscious
<br>
than is a succession of frozen heads, or a movie showing a speech
<br>
by Humphrey Bogart that used, say, a million frames per second.
<br>
No matter how alive and how conscious Bogart appears, he's
<br>
not being emulated at all, merely simulated.
<br>
<p>Perhaps in another post, I will have to say how the above can be
<br>
extended in a TRULY HUGE GLUT to encompass an intelligent
<br>
reply to every possible question that you may put to it. In effect,
<br>
it merely &quot;looks up&quot; the answer.  Unlike Searle's Chinese Room,
<br>
however, it doesn't manipulate information or perform calculations.
<br>
The lookup is merely indexical. 
<br>
<p>Thus I say that although it easily passes the Turing Test --- and
<br>
every other imaginable test --- this Truly Huge GLUT is a zombie,
<br>
and could in no possible way be fabricated, even theoretically,
<br>
with what is available today. It's size would be prohibitive. It would
<br>
require some kind of super-computronium. For those who aren't
<br>
familiar what that is, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium</a>
<br>
<p>So zombies are to me, only the faintest of ridiculously improbable
<br>
developments, and so zombies remain completely impossible except
<br>
in super-extreme thought experiements such as this.
