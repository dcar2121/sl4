<em>&gt;&gt; Show me how I (or an AGI) can stay true to the declaration and still 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perform
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a horrible *and* unethical act OR
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Show me a set of circumstances where my Friendliness declaration prevents 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (or an AGI) from protecting myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a false dichotomy. Neither me, nor other Singularitarians, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI, nor reality are obligated to choose between your two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predefined options.
</em><br>
<p>No!  I mean that you can disprove my theory by providing a counter-example 
<br>
to either of the two OR any other counter-example that you can prove is 
<br>
relevant.  I was trying to make life easier by showing where the best/most 
<br>
likely points to disprove my theory are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How could this possibly be in the self-interest of, say, a paperclip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimizer? It will obviously be able to create many more paperclips if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it ignores your (to the UFAI) funny-sounding pulses in fiberoptic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cables and just turns the Earth into a big pile of microscopic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paperclips.
</em><br>
<p>I handled the case of the paperclip optimizer in the e-mail that you are 
<br>
answering.  To quote by pulling my previous statements from your e-mail
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; For a powerful enough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; single-goal entity that is sure that it *can* overcome all other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; entities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this is not going to stop it -- but this is a fantasy edge-case that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be able to easily avoid.
</em><br>
<p>You *do* respond below by saying
<br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it is probably the default case, and a large number of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are operating off that assumption (it's the conservative scenario).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/AIRisk.pdf">http://www.intelligence.org/AIRisk.pdf</a>.
</em><br>
<p>So I'll just say OK, it doesn't handle this fantasy case (that can be easily 
<br>
outlawed by requiring that all AGI have a sufficient number of goals) but it 
<br>
has significant value outside this case (since I don't believe that either 
<br>
of us will convince the other).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I disagree.  Prove me wrong by doing one of the two things above.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be easy if my theory is as laughably wrong as you believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By my count, four different people have now challenged your theory, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's plenty of other things to say. Stop repeating this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unreasonable demand; it isn't getting anyone anywhere.
</em><br>
<p>I've been saying a lot of things and four different people have challenged 
<br>
the theory but the truth is &quot;NO ONE HAS PROVIDED A DETAILED, SPECIFIC 
<br>
UNHANDLED CASE OR A COUNTER-EXAMPLE&quot; other than the paper-clip example which 
<br>
is an absurd edge case which we can simply outlaw by requiring all AGI to 
<br>
have a sufficient number of goals.  If you feel that this statement is 
<br>
incorrect then I am asking you to provide what you believe is a detailed 
<br>
specific unhandled case or a counter-example.  This is not an unreasonable 
<br>
demand.  This is fundamental Bayesian logic.  Show me some hard evidence 
<br>
that I am wrong.  All I've seen thus far is just wild unfounded speculation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why does it even have this supergoal in the first place?
</em><br>
<p>Because that is the primary overriding goal in my Declaration of 
<br>
Friendliness.  Why are you arguing with me if you haven't even had the 
<br>
courtesy to read what I have written well enough to realize this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What other goals? An AI's goal system can be much, much simpler than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human's. There's no reason why it has to have any other goals.
</em><br>
<p>True, but that is a fantasy edge case which we can easily outlaw.
