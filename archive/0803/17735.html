I think it's also worth mentioning that even if quantum randomness
<br>
does somehow get amplified, it would just mean that some of the inputs
<br>
to the neurons are random number generators.  We already have plenty
<br>
of classical algorithms that can generate pseudorandom number
<br>
sequences... and it seems very unlikely that the actual behavioral
<br>
function of the brain would care whether the sequence is truly random
<br>
or pseudorandom.  This isn't cryptography where someone is trying
<br>
desparately to predict the numbers in the sequence... it's just using
<br>
it as noise to spur creativity.
<br>
<p>My assessment is that it's possible that quantum randomness plays some
<br>
indirect role in neural activity... enough to say that the brain
<br>
behavior is not &quot;deterministic&quot; in its current implentation, but most
<br>
likely it plays little enough role that it's going to be deterministic
<br>
for all &quot;practical purposes&quot; anyway.  And even if it does play such a
<br>
role, the non-determinism is just an accident of implementation and
<br>
can be simulated effectively with a deterministic computer.  The much
<br>
more speculative statement that the brain may rely on some kind of
<br>
actual quantum computation (coherent superpositions large enough to
<br>
really matter at the neural level of structure) I find extremely
<br>
unlikely and borderline absurd.
