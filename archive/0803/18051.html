<p>The files contain Sj (your friend reads this off the Monday computer)
<br>
along with other irrelevant states, but you aren't told which one is
<br>
Sj. If you pick out Sj correctly (by chance) does that count as
<br>
information transfer and hence result in no interruption to
<br>
consciousness? If there are only two files to choose from there is a
<br>
1/2 chance of picking Sj; if it is in a list of all possible states
<br>
then your chance of picking it is no better than if you had no
<br>
information at all, even though the Sj in the list was &quot;causally&quot;
<br>
generated.
