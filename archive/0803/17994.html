<p><em>&gt;&gt; This means that if there are 101 identical copies,

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; not remember being one of there fellow copies, they would diverge. Now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there would be 101 distinct individuals but they would all be John K
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Clark.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with that, even though I get the same answers as almost everyone
<br>
here did to Eliezer's puzzle, namely odds of 100:1 for seeing heads.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If this next moment involves opening the envelope,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you will end up finding that you are one (and only one)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of the 100 copies that reads &quot;no torture&quot; or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; single copy that reads &quot;torture&quot;. So you are 100 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; times as likely to read &quot;no torture&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your arithmetic is wrong. There are 2 versions of me, one gets tortured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and one does not, you figure out the odds.
</em><br>
<p>And after 1 millisecond, how many of you do you see, Winston?
<br>
And how many after ten seconds, in those slightly diverging environments?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's interesting that all the confusion and paradoxes about this topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanishes if you just make one small change in viewpoint. Try thinking of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself as an adjective not a noun.
</em><br>
<p>What about this:  I no longer think of Lee Corbin as a thing, but
<br>
just refer to the &quot;Lee Corbin process&quot;?  That makes &quot;Lee Corbin&quot;
<br>
technically an adjective.  Now &quot;process&quot; is still a noun, but you've
<br>
used nouns throughout this whole discussion to refer to yourself
<br>
and to others. Does that help?
<br>
