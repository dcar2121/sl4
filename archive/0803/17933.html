<p><em>&gt; On the whole question of whether your duplicate is really you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not, one thing seems to have been missed: there is more to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who you are than just your memories.
</em><br>
<p>If you and I exchange any given body part (except the brain)
<br>
then it's still clear afterwards who you are and who I am. But
<br>
suppose that somehow we could exchange cognitive ability,
<br>
exchange temperament, and exchange the instinctive
<br>
compassion we have for others. What then?
<br>
<p>Well, I might find myself suddenly able to think more clearly,
<br>
and perhaps find myself emotionally on a much more even
<br>
keel a lot of the time, and maybe having intense empathy
<br>
and compassion for innocents I see wronged in movies or
<br>
in real life.
<br>
<p>So what is it that has kept me &quot;me&quot;?  I say it's memories.
<br>
<p>For, if we suddenly exchanged *memories*, then you would
<br>
very suddenly find yourself in a townhouse in Santa Clara
<br>
California, needing always two or three pairs of glasses,
<br>
having little depth perception because of a weak left eye,
<br>
maybe being a lot taller or shorter, or heavier or leaner.
<br>
<p>With just the memories exchanged, you might suddenly find
<br>
also that you could visualize more easily than before, but that
<br>
logic seemed harder, or other things to that effect.
<br>
<p>You would *not* say to yourself, &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not Stuart
<br>
anymore.  I must be someone else.&quot;  No.  You would say
<br>
&quot;WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME?  And what
<br>
am I, Stuart, doing here? and why is everything blurry when I
<br>
look across the room?  Whose body is this?  It's not *mine*!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you are duplicated ten times, the most likely outcome is that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will lose your partner, your house, your parents, your job, most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your possessions, 9/10s of your cash, and most of your friends - all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in one short instant....
</em><br>
<p>As for the subsequent consequences --- legal fights and so on,
<br>
as Robin Lee Powell says, that would depend on your personality.
<br>
Each copy would sincerely think that he was Stuart Anderson, and
<br>
each of them would be one-hundred percent right!
<br>
<p>Lee
