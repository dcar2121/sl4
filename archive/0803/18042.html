<em>&gt; Care to mention ages, or at least proportions?  Since we don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  good measures and good tools, (and eventually may have many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  different but reliable measures such as we have in statistical theory)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  no precise answers can be forthcoming at this time.
</em><br>
<p>Not sure about proportions; but the rate of change is quite high (I
<br>
wouldn't consider I was the same person as 3 years ago, pretty much).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could you be embracing Mike Perry's notion of &quot;day persons&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  That is, each day you wake up you are really a different person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (Not that Mike endorses this view at all!)  But it's silly, IMNSHO
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to go around denying that you are not the same person you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  yesterday or a few minutes ago.  Talk about doing violence to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ordinary meanings of words!
</em><br>
<p>Words deserve all the violence we can inflict on them! :-)
<br>
I think we are talking of difference of degree, not of kind. We can
<br>
merge me with a recent duplicate of me; or we can merge Shakespear
<br>
with Einstein; the second is just much harder. I am not entirely the
<br>
same as I was yesterday - very close, but the differences add up.
<br>
<p>Duplicates (assuming you duplicate all their friends and possessions)
<br>
are similar to each other; but the differences add up. We should not
<br>
say &quot;they are all Stuart&quot; up until some point when suddenly they are
<br>
no longer the same person.
<br>
<p>Mathematically, we could claim that two duplicates represent 1.001
<br>
people, and tend towards 1.8 people as they age; if their experiences
<br>
are different enough, they will reach 2 people.
<br>
<p>Not too sure about the moral consequences of this. Logically, killing
<br>
one duplicate immediately is barely a crime; the evil of killing
<br>
increases as the two diverge, and there are a host of questions - what
<br>
if you kill one with a slow acting poison? what if the two diverge
<br>
much faster, because of some traumatic event?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nozick's seriously stupid idea of &quot;closest continuuer&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Don't know what that idea is, but the name sounds appealing. I do feel
<br>
that if I was duplicated every day, and the duplicates were either
<br>
frozen or sent of to live other lives, then (if I was deprived of my
<br>
social interactions and my posessions) I would not have a strong claim
<br>
to being &quot;Stuart Armstrong&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  P.S. I'm making my way through your very interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf">http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf</a> , but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  alas, am woefully not up to speed discussing this issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  on this list. But maybe I'll get better  :-)
</em><br>
<p>Danke! :-)
