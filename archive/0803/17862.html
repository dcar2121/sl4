<em>&gt; I claim that isomorphic copies separated enough in spacetime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to constitute separate physical processes are separate subjects.
</em><br>
<p>This is rather nonsensical to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose that there is an absolutely identical you being held
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an Earth-like simulated city near Sirius.  It ought to matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you that one of them is going to shortly die.
</em><br>
<p>You're using faulty terminology to gain psychological advantage for your
<br>
faulty assertion. (&quot;One of them is going to shortly die&quot; implies death
<br>
of a self in this context, which really isn't the case here; see further
<br>
down.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, certainly it matters in that there'd be one less instance of me
<br>
(in this universe, anyway), and therefore less redundancy and
<br>
fault-tolerance. (Were one to go more abstract, also some of my
<br>
potential futures might be weeded out by that, but that happens all the
<br>
time anyways without it being deadly.)
<br>
<p>An sich I see no reason to fret over one instance terminating.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, right now you are &quot;both&quot;, i.e., you can't tell whether you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Earth or near Sirius, (and I always claim that you actually are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in both places at the same time).
</em><br>
<p>Good, you're somewhat sane so far. However this puts at a rather odd
<br>
light your previous statement about &quot;one of them shortly dying&quot;. Rather,
<br>
one would cease to be (instantiated) in one of the places one previously
<br>
was. This does not sync up with &quot;death&quot; in any way or form (to stretch a
<br>
bit, unless moving my arse to the kitchen kills me in the living room;
<br>
sure, you can say so, but it isn't a very practical definition nor does
<br>
it reflect the subjective experience). I suggest that this is where you
<br>
should reconcile your views a bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But suppose that one atom of the Earth version is missing. Does that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really matter?  Surely there are not suddenly two people where just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a second ago there was just one.  Likewise, taking away more atoms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of them will have to be damaged a great deal to cease being you.
</em><br>
<p>One atom missing would presumably (chaos and all) diverge the copies
<br>
given some time. I don't claim to know _exactly_ where the line goes as
<br>
to when two similar processes have the same subjective existence and
<br>
when they don't. We can already see clearly where the line isn't crossed
<br>
(multiple identical digital error-resistant instances) and where it is
<br>
(noticable difference of output given same sensory input), the rest is
<br>
for future study.
<br>
<p>Anyways, I generally suggest discussing digital error-resistant
<br>
processes and going by rather direct mathematical comparisons of the
<br>
instances; otherwise we just get into wanking over something we just
<br>
don't know how to properly quantify (at this point, anyway), and that
<br>
doesn't really lead anywhere productive.
<br>
<p>Incidentally and slightly relevantly, as far as value judgements go, I
<br>
am of the opinion that if there are several highly similar but
<br>
nevertheless noticably different selves, it's as such a lesser loss if
<br>
one of them kicks the bucket than if they were a diverse group. (For
<br>
instance, also everyone transforming into orgasmatrons of one basic
<br>
architecture would be quite a loss, even if they didn't merge all the
<br>
way.)
<br>
<p>This is also relevant for the concept of &quot;local death&quot; used by Egan in
<br>
at least Schild's Ladder; even a separate instance of you dying can be
<br>
shrugged off as little if anything more than a slight case of amnesia,
<br>
if you have a timely backup. Here one's own judgement should take
<br>
precedence; for instance, let's have a freak accident instantiate an
<br>
earlier snapshot while a more experienced one is still in play. Is it
<br>
suicide for it to terminate? I don't really think so, but regardless it
<br>
should be that instance's call. (I also reserve the right to make a
<br>
different call than I think I'd make in that situation :] )
<br>
<p>Anyway, back to business.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To return to Eliezer's hypothesis---sorry---instantly after the coin flip,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one who got heads is duplicated all over the place.  If we stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right there, then *subjectively* you have to figure your  odds at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only 1:100 of seeing tails since
</em><br>
<p>No, because there is only one subject. It is just in many places at the same
<br>
time, to use your own terminology :]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and here is why:  For clarity, consider that ten minutes later,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 out of the 101 suddenly cease to exist. Then this is repeated,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and again ten minutes later instantaneous disintegration comes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a random 100 of the 101, and this is repeated again and again.
</em><br>
<p>Here you manage to demonstrate that if you terminate the heads-seeing
<br>
self with a probability of 1/101 and the tails-seeing self with a
<br>
probability of 100/101 you'll most often end up with a heads-seeing one.
<br>
<p>I agree. :)
