<p><em>&gt; &gt; - If 1000 copies of you are made in London lacking 50% of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; memories and 10 copies are made in Paris lacking 5% of your memories,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are you more likely to find yourself waking up in London or Paris?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess it depends on what part of your memories you use to identify your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Self  :)
</em><br>
<p>Let's say many memories, aspects of personality etc. are involved in
<br>
sense of self, and these are lacking in the proportions as above. Is
<br>
your subjective probability of ending up as a particular copy
<br>
proportional to the degree of fidelity of that copy? What if the
<br>
copying is low in quality but high in quantity? You would expect
<br>
*something* since you might expect something after a head injury with
<br>
partial memory loss. But what, exactly, if there are multiple copies
<br>
involved? I don't think there is a clear answer because the notion of
<br>
subjective probability is based on the idea that you are a single
<br>
person who persists through time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; - You are offered two choices:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (a) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Paris. The Paris copy is tortured while the London copies are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (b) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Paris. After an hour, the 100 copies in London are tortured while the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; copy in Paris is duplicated 100,000 times and none of these copies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is your subjective probability of being tortured at the moment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; original copying greater in (a) or (b)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do we even measure the _degree_ of torture?  If I am to identify with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every copy as myself: scenario A divides my identity 101 ways and only one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is tortured (resulting in &lt;1% subjective torture, assuming the 100 London
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies are blissfully happy)  Scenario B has a division of my identity into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100,100 parts, with 100 being tortured (&lt;0.1% subjective torture)  So it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't seem to matter that scenario B has 100 times as much torture in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future because it is statistically overwhelmed by the greater number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies experiencing the Not-torture option.
</em><br>
<p>That's one way to look at it. The other way to look at it is that if
<br>
you choose (b) you have a 100-fold greater chance of finding yourself
<br>
in London, where torture is certain in an hour, as compared to finding
<br>
yourself in Paris, where you will notice nothing at all when you are
<br>
duplicated in an hour. To change the example a little, nothing makes a
<br>
difference to the subjective probability of being tortured to either
<br>
the London copies or the Paris copy if they are able to decide on
<br>
finding themselves at either city whether the Paris duplication takes
<br>
place, so why should it make a difference at an earlier point?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Note that there is no problem *objectively* describing what happens in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any of these cases. Lee tries to take the objective point of view and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; translate it into the subjective point of view as well. But to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would require a complete overthrow of our notions of anticipation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subjective probability, and I don't think this is possible without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rewiring our brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the rewiring our brains is part of the assumptions for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought experiment.  I assumed the greater &quot;run-time&quot; offered by many copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was only really possible in either an uploaded consciousness situation or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some massively expanded awareness of multiple worlds.  In either case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewiring a brain would seem to be the easy part. :)
</em><br>
<p>I am assuming that, though our brains might be rewired, they are
<br>
functionally identical, including beliefs about personal identity and
<br>
subjective probabilities. Of course if the uploads are designed, for
<br>
example, to desire a greater total runtime regardless of subjective
<br>
probabilities and anticipation of the future that would change things.
