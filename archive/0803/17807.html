<p>Seriously I'd argue that consciousness is an issue of quantity (1-N) not 
<br>
a unique quality.
<br>
<p>Consciousness is just a stream of events and awareness. Being human we are 
<br>
a bit biased in wanting to say why our consciousness is intrinsically 
<br>
special qualitatively different than a whale, worm, plant or solar flare. 
<br>
The only reason we are able to have this conversation is not due to being 
<br>
uniquely conscious, its due to our species advanced level of tool use.
<br>
<p>Thought is simply a greatly sped up form of evolution. Patterns of nerve
<br>
firing compete. If you look at the nervous system you see all sorts of negative
<br>
feedback, loops that will tend to shutdown all but the currently dominant 
<br>
pattern. The cells firing in that pattern eventually weakens and another
<br>
pattern takes over.
<br>
<p>I'd argue that in the broad sense of things a field of wild flowers is 
<br>
conscious and thinks (evolves), its just a much much slower version of 
<br>
the competition of ideas (patterns) that happen in our own brains. Don't 
<br>
expect to have a philosophical conversation with it for a billion 
<br>
years or so until it figures out how to build a high speed brain of its 
<br>
own.
