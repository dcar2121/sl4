</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No interruption.  The last state on the Australian machine is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  identical to the first state on the Vienna machine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry for labouring the point but I intended that there be no overlap.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, probably my error.  Anyway...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Australian operator reads the last state S(n) of his machine, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfers this information to the Vienna operator who works out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (from knowledge of the machine's operation) that he must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start up his machine in state S(n+1).
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have utterly no problem with an overlap of simply two
<br>
states, nor can I imagine anyone having an objection. (BTW,
<br>
I will still get around to starting a &quot;Repeated Experience&quot; thread,
<br>
since at very least you, John Clark, and I will probably differ.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this way the combined machines + operators can reliably carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the same computations as a single machine.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  In other words, it's as though the Vienna operator, a
<br>
very smart dude, works out *himself* with, say, his pocket
<br>
calculator, S(n+1). Quite all right with me.  I don't think it
<br>
ever matters where a computation is done, nor on what
<br>
hardware.  Just so that it's a real computation, and so
<br>
sustains real causality and information flow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if the Australian operator simply provides a list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all possible states, knowing but not telling which one is S(n),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that seems to me exactly the same as providing no information at all;
</em><br>
<p>I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i.e. the same as if the Vienna operator knew nothing about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antipodean device and simply tried random states, one of them just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening to be S(n+1). How does this affect whether consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interrupted?
</em><br>
<p>Very good question.  In that case there is an infinitesimal interruption in
<br>
consciousness, because there was no genuine information flow or 
<br>
causality, in other words, to me, not a real computation at all. All
<br>
possible things are tried in Vienna.  I think I see where you are going,
<br>
but I'll let you deliver the next blow!  :-)
