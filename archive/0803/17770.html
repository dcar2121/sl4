<p><em>&gt; Yes, I was exploring the idea that a random system might still have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;objective meaning&quot;. It will of course be meaningless to any external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer, but it might be meaningful to its own *internal* observers.
</em><br>
<p>That's a remarkable thesis, and I'm a little skeptical. If by &quot;random&quot;
<br>
you mean that the system really does have KC equal to its size in
<br>
bits, (what I mean by &quot;random&quot;), then it defies my understanding
<br>
that it could even have internal observers. 
<br>
<p>To be concrete, there is this completely sealed box in front of you
<br>
that happens to have Kolmogorov Complexity equal to something
<br>
on the order of its mass multiplied by Avogadro's number, or some
<br>
large multiple thereof depending on how much information per cubic
<br>
meter the box can possibly have.  But any observer, even a
<br>
photographic plate, has non-random structure. So how can this be?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  That was sort of Hilary Putnam's point when he said that any rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  emulates anything.  But to me, it's pointless unless an emulation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  driven causally in real time in order to effect a computation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see why you say that. A moment of consciousness implemented in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dust cloud should be just as good as a moment of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented in your head.
</em><br>
<p>Don't want to be picky, but how long is a &quot;moment&quot;?  For me, if
<br>
there is no information flow, there cannot be consciousness. &lt;sigh&gt;
<br>
I admit that by &quot;information flow&quot; I'm subscribing to a belief in
<br>
the importance of time as a basic physical reality---I've never 
<br>
bought into Barbour's views or any of that. It's all too theoretical
<br>
and unsure.
<br>
<p>For example, if you were right, then it could be that coherent local
<br>
small systems like Lee Corbin are only 0.00000000001 of where
<br>
I really get my runtime.  In that case, it wouldn't matter if this
<br>
particular organization in this little corner of California in this little
<br>
corner of our galaxy continued to execute.
<br>
<p>Important: morally, it wouldn't be such a great crime to wipe out
<br>
people here on this little planet, since .9999999999 of their 
<br>
experience would go on just as before (on the reading, say, that
<br>
our level-one universe is incredibly vast, but not infinite, and there
<br>
is just one planet Earth).

<br>
<p><em>&gt; You might argue that the advantage of a head
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that it will continue producing subsequent moments of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the dust cloud will not. However, that isn't so if anything can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be interpreted as a computation: the dust cloud will produce all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your moments of consciousness in parallel; or if you object to that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of economy some other dust cloud vastly distant in time and space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will implement your next moment, and another one the moment after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, and so on. This seems to me to be an inevitable consequence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the multiple realisability criterion of functionalism. We can avoid it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if we say the brain contains special non-computable processes, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see no reason to do that.
