<p><em>&gt;  &gt; It's very difficult to even define what counts as a causal link.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Suppose you're in charge of the Tuesday computer and your friend gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; you two files, one of which is Sj from the end of the Monday computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; run while the other is not. If you input one of the files at random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; and it turns out to be Sj, does that count as a causal link?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, then we have a slightly new situation:  Sm is no longer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  first Tuesday state, but the second. Sj was (maybe) carried
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by sneaker net to the Tuesday computer. That's just like being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ideally teleported!  :-)
</em><br>
<p>What I had in mind was that Sj is used as input to produce its
<br>
successor Sm, from which the rest of Tuesday follows
<br>
deterministically. If Sj is reliably transferred from the first to the
<br>
second computer that would be the same as if the computation unfolded
<br>
in the one intact machine, no? But if the transfer were unreliable it
<br>
would only be by chance that the &quot;right&quot; sequence of states was set
<br>
into motion giving rise to the Tuesday experience.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  [I'm recalling that State-j was the last state of Monday, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  State-m was the first state of Tuesday, when ordinarily on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a normal computer Sj would give rise to Sm by the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of physics or their in-computer equivalent.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So in *no case* in your new scenario above is there a causal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  link, i.e., what I mean, a &quot;computed link&quot; characterized by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  computed information flow. The only computations in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  new scenario (with Sj being both the last state of Monday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and the first state of Tuesday) are the computations inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the computer that go from Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;...-&gt;Sj  and Sj-&gt;Sk-&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Again, if Sm would arise strictly by chance on the Tuesday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  computer, then this one state would---to me---fail to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  been computed. And so thereby inflict an infinitesimal break
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  To take a more extreme case, suppose again that the last seven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  minutes of Monday had suffered just this same lack of what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  call bonafide computation, and that all the states of those seven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  minutes had arisen strictly by chance. Then we begin the inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  downward spiral (e.g. see &quot;The Story of a Brain&quot; in Hofstadter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  and Dennett's &quot;The Mind's I&quot;).  I say that it leads to ABSURDITY,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  and the weak point in the chain MUST be this point at which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  as I say, &quot;no actual computing is done&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt; If you drop that idea you may as well say that only brand name
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &gt; neurons are capable of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt; No, I don't need to go that far!  :-)    My target is merely rocks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  being conscious, or patches of dust between here and the Hyades
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  supercluster being 0.99999999999 of Stathis's experience in life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Well, you *could* say that there is something fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; non-computable about the brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do we want or need to go there?  What is the appeal to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and Schmidhuber and the rest of the gang to all that dust comprising
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  0.99999999999 of your experience?  That would seem to me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  induce fatalism.
</em><br>
<p>Determinism, yes. Is that the same as fatalism?
