<p><em>&gt;  &gt; (a) The file I've received says that the final state of the Australian

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; input that into my machine, the computation won't know it has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; spread across two continents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How did you get a hold of S-2037?   If you looked it up somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  or heard from a little bird that you should try S-2037, then the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would be no. But if you worked out, i.e., your brain emulated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  machine itself, i.e. calculated state S-2037 from S-6754, then yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  no [infinitesimal] interruption occurred.
</em><br>
<p>I looked it up. The physics of the machine is such that state A will
<br>
reliably transition to state B. This can either be worked out from
<br>
first principles or by experiment, and the results stored in a table.
<br>
The entire computation could be done by hand in this way by a human
<br>
operator who blindly follows the rules and has no more idea where the
<br>
rules came from (or the grander purpose behind his actions) than an
<br>
individual gear or transistor does. We need to agree that the causal
<br>
link is preserved in (a), with *no* interruption in consciousness,
<br>
before considering (b) and (c).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; (b) The file I've received gives the final state of the Australian
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; machine as either S-6754 or S-789. Their respective successor states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; are S-2037 and S-9175, so I'll try both of those, and when I get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; right one, the computation and its consciousness will have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; implemented without interruption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. The other run will either occur entirely incorrectly, or, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  somehow getting back on track, will suffer even more than that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  tiny interruption of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; (c) The file from Australia lists all possible machine states S-1 to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; S-9999. I have a lot of work ahead of me, but one of them has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the right one. First, I'll input S-1, the successor state of S-3412;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; then S-2, which as everyone knows is the successor state of S-439;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; next, S-3, successor of S-2031 (or was it S-3021? I always get those
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; two mixed up but it's definitely one or the other)... and so on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; S-9999.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Unless I've missed something, I think that this is just the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  logical next step after (b), and so the answer is should be just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the same. All of these here in (c) seem to me to implement a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  computation that has one non-causal step, i.e., a tiny tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  lapse of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; You can see that the Vienna operator's muttering as he goes about his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; work in the last example has no effect on the mechanics of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; computation. As he inputs S-2037 he could be thinking that it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; successor of S-6754, or he could be thinking about what he will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; for dinner, and it will make no difference to his behaviour as he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; just inputting all the states anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; In which of the above cases is the causal link between the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; machines preserved? In which does consciousness continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; uninterrupted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that I have answered. In some cases, the state S-2037
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  really was computed in a local calculation, and in some cases it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  was gotten by chance, more or less. In the former there were no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  interruptions of consciousness, but in the latter there were.
