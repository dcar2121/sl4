<p>They see the same thing. What is the query that fails to be answered
<br>
by this model?
<br>
<p>There is nothing special about first-person perspective: the only
<br>
thing that is different from me observing another person and that
<br>
person observing himself is the position of sensors. We all observe
<br>
ourselves from a third-person perspective. Our thoughts are
<br>
observations that parts of our brains make from other parts of our
<br>
brains, they are seen from a third-person perspective inside
<br>
ourselves. Feelings and drives are important concepts because they
<br>
describe what's going on in our minds, they explain modes of thought.
<br>
But they did not evolve to handle the reasoning of a creature that
<br>
gets copied all of a sudden, with preservation of all its memories, so
<br>
there is no reason to postulate a new ad-hoc feeling of anticipation
<br>
that is supposed to help in this task.
