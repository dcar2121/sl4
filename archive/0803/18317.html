&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, it doesn't seem so outlandish a possibility that a government or governments of any particular type will actually come to the realization within the decade that AGI even in-principle is monumentally important - even without a powerfully functional AGI in-hand. And if that realization ever dawned, I don't find it totally outlandish that that hypothetical government would throw massive resources at the project. Perhaps picking-up from the work of other groups, or perhaps starting fresh with best ideas and a 15 Billion dollar expense account. Even if the probability was small (and that's questionable, IMO), it should still be considered carefully.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently SIAI also doesn't consider it stupid and delusional, since they've recently made it clear that they intend to &quot;energize&quot; the US government as another means to achieving a safe Singularity.
