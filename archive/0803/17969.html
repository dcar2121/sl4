<p>
<em>&gt;  Why do you believe preservation of memories is important in the first place?
</em><br>
<p>Partially because of what happens when memories are lost; alzhimer
<br>
patients and amnesiacs are most definetly not the same person they
<br>
were.
<br>
<p>Also because of the role that memories play in deciding an action;
<br>
before doing something, my memories of previous occurances resurface,
<br>
along with memories of people's reactions, maybe of some book I read,
<br>
maybe of some conversation with friends, maybe of some news report.
<br>
These are very important for most of my decisions (especially if I
<br>
include &quot;instinctive memories&quot; as well). So most of my actions, and of
<br>
the things I say, are heavily influenced by my memories.
<br>
<p>If my memories were different, I would act differently, speak
<br>
differently, and deal with situations differently. I do not see how
<br>
this person could credibly be considered to be me. Hence memories are
<br>
a necessary condition for identity - though probably not sufficient.
<br>
