Hello list!
<br>
<p>I'm Stuart Armstrong, up until now a protected bystander lurking on
<br>
the edges of the list. But this one-way relationship is no longer for
<br>
me, so I decided to commit. And post.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One list custom is the JOIN post, where you post whatever information
</em><br>
about yourself you're willing to share and which we might be
<br>
interested in.
<br>
<p>That second category is much, much smaller than the first, so I'll try
<br>
and keep this brief.
<br>
<p>I'm a British-Canadian mathematician, brought up in Hong Kong and
<br>
France, currently working in Vienna. My interest in
<br>
singularity-related stuff started when I discovered the Future of
<br>
Humanity Institute in Oxford, and hasn't declined since. Having read
<br>
quite a lot since, I now find my original ideas hopelessly naive and
<br>
unoriginal. I hope to continue this process, until it can't get any
<br>
further - then I'll have a chance a being useful and original.
<br>
<p>I'd probably be a SL3.2 on the future shock list - I still get
<br>
over-excited on most singularity related issues. It's easy to tell
<br>
when I get over-excited - my posts get dull and pedantic (of course,
<br>
this situation has to be carefully distinguished from cases when I'm
<br>
dull and pedantic because I'm feeling depressed, elated, happy, sad,
<br>
angry, lazy, interesting, or dull).
<br>
<p>I have to confess a certain scepticism to the whole concept of the
<br>
Singularity in mathematical terms (reaching some infinity/absurdly
<br>
high level in a short amount of time). I have no problem with the
<br>
physics analogy (rapidly reaching a situation so unimaginably
<br>
different that our ability to predict anything sensible completely
<br>
breaks down).
<br>
<p>No childhood traumas of note (my parents were loving and supportive -
<br>
I'm planning to sue them when my autobiography fails to sell) and no
<br>
more epiphanies than the average guy (six and a half per lifetime,
<br>
according to the most recent statistics).
<br>
<p>All in all, I hope I'll be a useful addition to this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you have something to say, don't phrase it in the form of a
</em><br>
question.  This holds especially true for your first post.
<br>
<p>Phew! Fortunately I managed to avoid that rookie mistake.
<br>
Or did I?
