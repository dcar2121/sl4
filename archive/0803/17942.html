<p>
<em>&gt;  So what is it that has kept me &quot;me&quot;?  I say it's memories.
</em><br>
<p>I'd say that memories are a necessary but not sufficient condition to
<br>
keep you &quot;you&quot;. The guards and inmates in the Stanford prison
<br>
experiment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment</a>
<br>
ended up behaving completely differently after only a few short days.
<br>
If a guard had been a duplicate of one of the prisoners, their
<br>
memories would have been virtually identical; and yet, to all extent
<br>
and purposes, they are not the same person.
<br>
<p>But it's not so much &quot;duplicates are different people&quot; that I was
<br>
looking at. I'm more arguing that if your actual life was similar to a
<br>
duplicate experience (that nothing that you accumulated was permanent;
<br>
that no friend can be relied on; that your crimes have little
<br>
consequences; that stability is forever beyond your grasp) then you
<br>
would most likely be a different person from day to day (or at least
<br>
from week to week). Or you would gravitate to the stable attractor
<br>
&quot;homeless, jobless, friendless, wanderer&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  You would *not* say to yourself, &quot;Oh, I guess I'm not Stuart
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  anymore.  I must be someone else.&quot;  No.  You would say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED TO ME?  And what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  am I, Stuart, doing here? and why is everything blurry when I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  look across the room?  Whose body is this?  It's not *mine*!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Of course. But how would I feel after a few days, a week, a month, a
<br>
year? What if I woke up female? Or in jail?
<br>
<p>I'm not arguing any coherent position here, just that memories are not
<br>
the end all of who you are (just think of hormones, for example). And
<br>
thus I feel that saying &quot;all ten duplicates start out as the same
<br>
person&quot;, is correct. However, saying &quot;all ten duplicates are Stuart&quot;
<br>
is wrong. They are, to an extent, a new person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  As for the subsequent consequences --- legal fights and so on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as Robin Lee Powell says, that would depend on your personality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Each copy would sincerely think that he was Stuart Anderson, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  each of them would be one-hundred percent right!
</em><br>
<p>Except I wouldn't! A lot of my memories are external to myself -
<br>
stored in pictures, computers, environments, and relationships.
<br>
Deprived of these, I would not think of myself as the same person.
<br>
<p>This post had some kind of point to it, honest, before it became all meandery.
<br>
<p>Stuart
