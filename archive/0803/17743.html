<p><em>&gt; &gt; At any rate the distinction becomes less clear. But it would also make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sense to talk about isomorphisms of context, in addition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; isomorphisms of signal.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Example?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Well the most general example I can think of is usage of signal as foreground,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise as background, regardless of the contingencies of message modality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or what specifically constitutes signal. if we go back to the fibonacci example...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qwe*gta*rfe**yqw***qdw*****plo********lmo  etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as opposed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1,1,2,3,5,8,...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; There are two isomorphisms here. There is firstly, the obvious one, an isomorphism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between both signals as well as an actual mathematical fibonacci sequence.
</em><br>
<p>I understand that one.  That was, of course, what I mean by &quot;isomorphic meaning&quot;
<br>
(as opposed to &quot;conventional meaning&quot;, or meaning by convention).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In addition however, a second isomorphism, the usage of signal on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one hand ( a '*' in our first example, a digit in our second) as foreground,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or message carrier, [on the one hand]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the usage of some kind of filler 'noise' to separate units within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signal, could also be construed as isomorphic with the notion of communication,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [on the other]
</em><br>
<p>That seems pretty complicated to me, sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which is a natural byproduct of intelligence. (and, in fact, isomorphic with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process of reasoning as well, since our own thoughts have signal as well as noise). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Am I clear here? process of communication, as well as any arbitrary instantiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of communication is isomorphic with other intelligent activities. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;A process of communication is isomorphic with other intelligent activities&quot;?
<br>
Well, such an isomorphism seems pretty deep to me, not at all obvious or
<br>
clear.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Lee
