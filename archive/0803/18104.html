<em>&gt;  I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;objective anticipation&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Let me explain it a bit further, comparing and contrasting what I'm
<br>
calling &quot;subjective anticipation&quot; with &quot;objective anticipation&quot;...
<br>
<p>Subjective anticipation is anticipating what &quot;your&quot; next experience
<br>
will be, based on some subjective notion of personal identity.
<br>
Reincarnation is a good example of subjective anticipation.  Anyone is
<br>
free to believe that when they did, their
<br>
mind/soul/consciousness/essence will be reincarnated as someone else,
<br>
perhaps even someone in the past.  So, for example, if I believe that
<br>
when I die I will be reincarnated as Jackie Kennedy... then on my
<br>
deathbed I might be (subjectively) anticipating that my next
<br>
experience is going to be Jackie's formative years in 1929.  I don't
<br>
think there is anything inconsistent about this belief, but it's
<br>
important to note that it is a *subjective* belief and doesn't affect
<br>
any objective properties of the world.  Someone might object that
<br>
Jackie has different genes from me, and different memories.  But
<br>
people can get amnesia and you would still call them the same person,
<br>
so as long as you hold onto a notion of subjective personal
<br>
identity... that there is some *subject* experiencing things, rather
<br>
than simply the object of your brian processing information, then you
<br>
are free to believe whatever you like.  Taking the reincarnation
<br>
example further, there is nothing stopping me from anticipating that
<br>
every 5 seconds, I experience different snipets of different minds all
<br>
over the globe, or perhaps even each one in a different time.  Every 5
<br>
seconds of course, I forget where I was during the last 5 seconds and
<br>
instead immediately become aware of whatever memories the new person
<br>
has that I'm in.  There is no experiment anyone could do or evidence
<br>
they could present me to convince me otherwise, since this is just as
<br>
consistent as John Clark's belief that if he is copied 1000 times and
<br>
tortured 999 of those times, he will have a 50% chance of subjectively
<br>
experiencing torture in the next moment.  Both are fine, they just
<br>
have no impact on the objective world or relevance to discussions
<br>
about building a good AI.
<br>
<p>In contrast, objective anticipation does impact the world.  I don't
<br>
have to view myself as a subject at all.  I can just consider the
<br>
facts... regardless of where I believe my personal identity is stored,
<br>
I know that if my brain is copied 100 times and put into 1000
<br>
different bodies and sent out into the world, then it is going to have
<br>
1000 times the impact on the world.  Each of those 1000 copies can
<br>
make his own decisions, but all of them will have my memories, skills,
<br>
genes, desires, way of thinking, etc.  So whatever goal I have, I can
<br>
accomplish it with 1/1000th the manhours if I make the copies.  All I
<br>
need to do is perform the task in parallel.  Since I know how my mind
<br>
works, I know that if I set my intentions to do something... unless a
<br>
good reason presents itself to change my mind otherwise, I carry
<br>
through on that plan.  This means that, regardless of whether I view
<br>
those 1000 copies as &quot;me&quot; or simply people with my memories, I know
<br>
that I have a strong influence on them.  Much stronger than any
<br>
influence I have on anyone else in the world.  If I set my intentions
<br>
to do something, it affects what they do.  If I hone my skills then
<br>
they are given those skills.  if I figure something out or expand my
<br>
knowledge, then they are given that knowledge.
<br>
<p>So given this way of thinking about the copying process objectively,
<br>
instead of worrying about some &quot;personal identity&quot; surviving or not
<br>
surviving (which I would argue is meaningless), there is only one
<br>
right answer to what I should anticipate *objectively*, regardless of
<br>
what my goals are.  I want to maximize the survival of my copies, not
<br>
because I'm worried about my personal identity surviving, but because
<br>
that maximizes my current causal influence on the world.  No matter
<br>
what my goals are, I have a better chance of accomplishing them if
<br>
more of my copies survive.  (No doubt, evolution has helped implant
<br>
this sentiment in me!)  So to help them survive, I should put my brain
<br>
into a state that is useful for them.  Believing that I'm going to be
<br>
Jackie Kennedy in the next moment, right before I get copied, does not
<br>
help prepare them for what's going to happen to them.  They will have
<br>
my memories, so the first thought that goes through all of their heads
<br>
will be &quot;oh,... I'm not Jackie Kennedy.  guess I was wrong!&quot;  If I'm
<br>
told that 999 of them are going to have a giant rock fall on them 1
<br>
second after they are booted up, and the other 1 of them is going to
<br>
have giant rocks fall all around them but *not* exactly on him... then
<br>
I should anticipate a 99.9% chance that a giant rock is going to fall
<br>
on me.  If I do that, then all of them will run as soon as they boot
<br>
up, which will cause 999 of them to avoid being hit by the boulder,
<br>
and the other 1 to be killed.  Taking John Clark's strategy of
<br>
anticipating a 50% chance that the rock will fall on him will result
<br>
in... on average... 500 of them running and 500 of them staying put
<br>
(assuming they choose to do one or the other with probabity .5, which
<br>
would be the rational thing to do assuming your objective anticipation
<br>
is correct).  The result of John Clark's anticipation would be roughly
<br>
500 of them being killed and 500 of them surviving, plus or minus 1
<br>
depending on what the one who had the rocks drop all around him
<br>
instead of on him decided to do.
<br>
<p>I hope this clears up what I mean by &quot;objective anticipation&quot;, why
<br>
it's more useful than subjective anticipation, and why using
<br>
subjective anticipation instead of objective anticipation can
<br>
seriously cripple your chances of carrying out future goals, whatever
<br>
they may be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Suppose you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  have the choice of either being given a million dollars, or having 10
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  copies of yourself made who will then have their memories wiped and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  each given a million dollars. Subjectively, I would like to be given
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the million dollars. Objectively, my copies will prosper if I choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the second option,
</em><br>
<p>First, it depends on what you mean by &quot;their memories are wiped&quot;.  How
<br>
much do they remember?  They must remember *some* things (like how to
<br>
walk and talk) otherwise they will certainly not be able to &quot;prosper&quot;
<br>
even if given the money.  They won't even know what money is!  But
<br>
assuming you give them something similar to amnesia where they
<br>
remember most of your skills, and some general life principles, but
<br>
not specifically who they are or what their life used to be like... I
<br>
think the situation is somewhere in between what I outlined above
<br>
(with full memories) and having kids.... probably being somewhat
<br>
closer to the having kids scenario.  You're passing on your genes, but
<br>
not your memories.  So your causal influence on your clones is
<br>
limited.  It's still better than just having kids, because you could
<br>
perhaps train yourself in certain things or give yourself certain
<br>
skills or subconscious desires before the memory wipe.  But it's not
<br>
nearly as good as cloning yourself with the memories intact.  And it
<br>
doesn't matter much what you anticipate in that case since they can't
<br>
take advantage of it.  At any rate, you could ask the same question
<br>
without the cloning part.  Would you rather get a thousand dollars and
<br>
keep your memories or get a million dollars and get amnesia?  Most
<br>
people (including me) would go for the thousand dollars, because my
<br>
memories are worth more than a million dollars to me.  But if you make
<br>
the amount high enough, perhaps it starts to sound like a good deal :)
