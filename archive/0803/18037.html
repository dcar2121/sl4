Stuart writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I never thought along those lines (though now I might). I have often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought about going back to the person I once was, and am sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past Stuart would not recognise me as the same person.
</em><br>
<p>Care to mention ages, or at least proportions?  Since we don't have
<br>
good measures and good tools, (and eventually may have many 
<br>
different but reliable measures such as we have in statistical theory)
<br>
no precise answers can be forthcoming at this time.
<br>
<p>As for me, I'm the same person I was when I was in my late teens.
<br>
Naturally, it tends to depend upon what anecdotes and memories
<br>
that are most salient at a given time when I'm doing the guessing.
<br>
For example, &quot;the fifty percent overlap&quot; in identity is definitely
<br>
exceeded if you take the 12 yr old Lee and compare him to
<br>
me. But---strictly you understand, to convey a *sense* of it---
<br>
the 30% me that my 12 yr old self  actually implemented more
<br>
Lee than any other creature alive on Earth today does, except
<br>
my present self of course. Likewise, perhaps 30 years ago, I
<br>
had a 80% overlap with who I am now.  Again, just to convey
<br>
a sense of it.  Hope this is making sense, I'm pretty tired.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The situation changes, though, if there are duplicates! Then I can no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer continue to carry the mantle of Stuart just out of laziness;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because &quot;well, I'm the closest thing around to what Stuart once was&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You can say that and think that, but we might reveal that we made
<br>
another duplicate of Stuart at some point in time that lays greater
<br>
claim to being the closest.  It is important to completely repudiate
<br>
Nozick's seriously stupid idea of &quot;closest continuuer&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps this example hints at what the problem is: maybe we shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be thinking &quot;me and my duplicate are the same person, just as me today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and me last year&quot;, but rather &quot;me today and me next year are a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different person, just as two of my duplicates in different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Could you be embracing Mike Perry's notion of &quot;day persons&quot;? 
<br>
That is, each day you wake up you are really a different person.
<br>
(Not that Mike endorses this view at all!)  But it's silly, IMNSHO
<br>
to go around denying that you are not the same person you were
<br>
yesterday or a few minutes ago.  Talk about doing violence to the
<br>
ordinary meanings of words!
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. I'm making my way through your very interesting 
<br>
<a href="http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf">http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf</a> , but
<br>
alas, am woefully not up to speed discussing this issue
<br>
on this list. But maybe I'll get better  :-)
