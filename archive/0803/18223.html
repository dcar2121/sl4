<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; But it is *so* important to know whether your husband has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; successfully uploaded, or if the incredibly smart AI is just faking it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; (though faking it well enough to fool you).  After all, if he's just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; being faked---I call that simulation---then he's dead!  Yikes!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; So I will continue to insist that the goal of uploading is to emulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; a human consciousness, not simulate it, and we need some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; of terminological distinction for this, if not the one I've been pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; on this list and Extropians for five or ten years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You just modify the neurons that makes you falsely believe that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distinction to make you also believe that the upload is successful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From your brief reply, I gather that you do not believe in such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So there is no essential difference between, say, your wife and her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abrupt replacement by an extremely skilled actress fashioned to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look just like her, but who is really laughing at you all the time, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; despises all the values your wife used to hold before her demise?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot believe that you'd endorse this simulation replacing your wife,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not if you truly love her.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now what about if she dies suddenly in her sleep, but a very kindly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and well-meaning AI plants a tiny microchip in her backbone that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manages to send out signals to all parts of her body that cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly the same thinking and acting to be done be done by the body?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, this microchip, over which the AI has no further use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no further interest in, *emulates* your wife. That is, this new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creature is conscious in just the same way as your wife was, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inner thoughts and suspicions in the same way, has the same tastes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and loves and hates and, in general values.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely this emulation &quot;really is&quot; your wife---it's just that she's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded. That's best for her, surely you concede, than being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced by a fiendish actor who is really a different person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altogether.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<p>But how do I know the AI chip really &quot;cares&quot; about her values, or just behaves
<br>
as if it cares?  Isn't this the same situation as the actress?
<br>
<p>If a simulation is just good enough to fool me, and emulation is perfectly
<br>
computationally equivalent, then how would I know the difference?
