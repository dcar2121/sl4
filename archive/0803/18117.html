<em>&gt;&gt;  computer (if you will) implements Sm-&gt;Sn-&gt;...-&gt;Sz on Tuesday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (Or last month, it doesn't really matter.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Sj is not the same state as Sm, and I got to talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  them as if they were the same state.  Sorry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the second computer entered by chance into the state Sj, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest of the states Sj-&gt;Sm-&gt;Sn etc. followed, would that avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interruption in consciousness?
</em><br>
<p>So I assume  (Monday's) Sa-&gt;...-&gt;Si   ,  (Tuesday's) Sj-&gt;Sm-&gt;Sn....
<br>
is what you're talking about.  In that case, there is still the same
<br>
(tiny, infinitesimal, insignificant) interruption in consciousness.
<br>
<p>Whereas, if you mean Sa-&gt;...-&gt;Si-&gt;Sj   ,   Sj-&gt;Sm-&gt;Sn.... 
<br>
then no, there would be no interruption in consciousness, the comma
<br>
meaning transfer of state from one machine to another (possibly
<br>
same) machine either long before Sa or maybe long after the
<br>
last state Sz was reached.
<br>
<p>(To the general reader: we are discussing *my* hypothesis here, and
<br>
so he's asking and I'm answering. Below, we discuss his.
<br>
<p>(The arrow notation -&gt;  means that one state causally follows from
<br>
another and implements information flow. For example, Sj-&gt;Sm
<br>
means that state m causally follows by the laws of physics or by the
<br>
laws of Conway's Life, or whatever, from state j.  Any states not
<br>
so connected are hereby denoted by spaces or commas. Also,
<br>
according to Stathis's original notation, alphabetical precedence
<br>
and subsequence denotes what *would* have transpired under
<br>
perfectly ordinary circumstances on a computer or TM, Life Board,
<br>
and so on, where, for example generation 00015 might be Sf and
<br>
the next generation 00016 would be Sg.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It doesn't seem fair to say... [because] It would open the way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that while a set of disconnected single states cannot implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a computation, a set of disconnected pairs of states can.
</em><br>
<p>Oh?  Maybe I misunderstood.  Can we defer the extraordinarily
<br>
interesting, crucial, appalling, and mind-blowing case of
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sa-&gt;Sb , Sc-&gt;Sd , Se-&gt;Sf , ...
<br>
<p>until later?  As you can well anticipate, this make my claims even
<br>
more unbelievable!  But I want to make sure, as you do, that you
<br>
have understood my claim up till now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  ...how the Sm state really arose.  If it arose by chance---i.e. no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  causal connection, no information flow from Sj---then there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is an iota of consciousness missing from any Monday/Tuesday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  run that suffered this tiny causal interruption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still haven't understood your position on information flow over a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noisy or unreliable channel. If two pieces of information are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transferred, and it is known that one is correct and the other not, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there an interruption in consciousness if the correct information is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used?
</em><br>
<p>No interruption.  Just like the sudden and miraculous appearance
<br>
of Sir Francis Bacon in an exact state that he really did occupy in
<br>
the 1600s. It really is him, and he didn't lose even an infinitesimal
<br>
bit of consciousness, because this is a case of  ...-&gt;Sd-&gt;Se-&gt;Sf...
<br>
in the 17th century followed by the sudden  Se-&gt;SF-&gt;SG-&gt;...
<br>
in the 20th century, where caps are used, partly, to indicate his
<br>
astonishment!  Because Se really happened back then and Se
<br>
also happened in the 20th century, his consciousness was not
<br>
interrupted in the slightest.
<br>
<p>Now it is I who will ask, and Stathis who will answer  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  Touche.  All right, then suppose I have a choice between (a) somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  magically removing from the universe---and causing to entirely cease to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  exist---a 400 kilogram of Stathis, or blowing your present biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  incarnation to smithereens.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Well, this will no doubt make it seem even more absurd to you but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; removing the rock from the universe won't make any difference either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; This is because if an amount of matter can map onto any computation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; then a smaller amount of matter can map onto the same computation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; multiple parallel processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Then why would it matter if your biological instance were removed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because that would mean my simulation stops (or its measure decreases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I don't believe my simulation can stop absolutely unless it could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow be shown logically impossible to derive computations that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my present mental state in their subjective past), whereas removing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rock does not affect me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; In the ultimate extrapolation of this idea a simulation of the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; universe maps onto the null state. This would mean that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; separate physical reality, but what we think of as physical reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; is a simulation on the big Universal Machine in Platonia. Thus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; physical reality is put on the same ontological basis as the natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Yes, I know. Like Tegmark's Level Four.  Like Greg Egan's &quot;Theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of Dust&quot; which, by the way, I had to infer from an interview he gave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that he does by no means entirely endorse that view (or any particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  view he so cleverly and superbly explicates in his novels).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have a reference to that interview?
</em><br>
<p>Sadly no, but it's still probably on his web site, which is where I'm pretty
<br>
certain I saw it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  Well, I'm sure you don't weigh 400kg, so let's say that you weigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  100kg. In comparison to the biological 100kg Stathis, how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  &quot;computation of Stathis&quot;, if I may ask, does a 100kg marble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  statue of you emulate?  Or, in other words, right now your 100kg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  because it's ordinary matter at about 295 degrees Kelvin, already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  emulates you to some degree.  What degree?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; There isn't a separate physical me. The physical me is a simulation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I do prefer &quot;emulation&quot; in this context since a very good actor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or a superhuman AI puppet master could just be pulling your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  strings, and there isn't any real feeling and thinking Stathis at all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  but only some inhuman God-like creature having a bit of fun.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Or a skillful enough actor, I suppose, who somehow does an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  incredibly good Stathis impersonation, while the real Stathis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  was executed in December.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Emulation&quot; implies that there is some gold standard - physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality - against which the simulation is to be measured. But if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole shebang is a simulation anyway, I'm not sure what the status of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an emulation is.
</em><br>
<p>I think in Computer Science, &quot;emulation&quot; has come to mean that, for
<br>
example, an Intel Machine can emulate an older Apple Machine, which
<br>
may be emulating a Commodore 64!   I do hope I'm using the words
<br>
right---it's been a while.  But no level of physical reality was actually
<br>
implied IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; and blowing up the physical me means the computations in Platonia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; underpinning me come to an end; whereas blowing up a statue of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; does not affect the computations relating to my consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I don't quite understand this point. Aren't you being emulated by rocks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or maybe large rocks also?  Aren't you being emulated by some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  patches of dust between the galaxies?  Since you're being emulated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  so many many places (assume for a moment our Level One universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is infinite like Tegmark says), surely the demise of a little bit of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in Australia (whether it's removed altogether from the universe, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  raised to 451 degrees Fahrenheit) can't make a difference, can it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I'm not being emulated by rocks, rocks and I are both being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emulated in Platonia.
</em><br>
<p>A most remarkable sentence. I'll have to start another thread on that
<br>
if no one comments, because it so tidily (if we're making no mistake)
<br>
sums up your position (and Tegmark's, Schmidhuber's, etc.). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That I appear to [be] conscious due to brain activity is due to the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the computations which give rise to a universe in which stars
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and planets form and life evolves have much higher measure than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computations where I just pop into existence out of nowhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a disembodied consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>I'll ponder that, thanks.
