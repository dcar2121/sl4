<p>
Ross,
<br>
<p>Can you please elaborate on what you mean by determinism?  If you mean  
<br>
what I think you mean, that past state-descriptions contain the  
<br>
information for present and then future state-descriptions, then the  
<br>
brain is probably a deterministic system.  Even if quantum computation  
<br>
is important for cognition––which it most likely isn't––then brain  
<br>
could still potentially be thought of as deterministic, depending on  
<br>
your favored interpretation of quantum mechanics.
<br>
<p>But more importantly, neurons are perfectly capable of supporting  
<br>
complex processing/behavior without quantum computation:  complex  
<br>
patterns of action potentials in large numbers of neurons, vast  
<br>
numbers multiple kinds of synapses that change their strengths with  
<br>
experience, higher-level processing structures such as limbic nuclei  
<br>
interacting with a columnar organized cortex; we're still figuring out  
<br>
the specifics of how this all works together, but there probably isn't  
<br>
a significant role for quantum effects in influencing the flow of  
<br>
information in our neural systems.  Quantum computation in neurons is  
<br>
unnecessary to explain behavior/cognition and the theory relies on  
<br>
speculative mechanisms that have not been empirically demonstrated and  
<br>
seem unlikely a priori.
<br>
<p>Question on quantum physics:  My background is in neuroscience, so I'm  
<br>
certainly not in a position to have strong opinions on this matter,  
<br>
but I've always been baffled by the quickness with which people  
<br>
conclude ontological indeterminacy from epistemological  
<br>
indeterminacy.  If measurement is uncertain/whacky at the quantum  
<br>
level, then doesn't that limit the strength of conclusions we can draw  
<br>
about the ontological status of quantum phenomena?  Couldn't the  
<br>
quantum systems be just as deterministic as classical systems, but  
<br>
we're unable to properly measure all of the relevant variables?
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
