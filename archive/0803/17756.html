Yes, the tree falling in the forest makes a sound.
<br>
<p>and no, its not preserved. since &quot;humanity&quot; does not equate with my
<br>
construal of humanity.

<em>&gt; &gt; It's probably a safe assumption that virtually all humans would prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that humanity wasn't murdered by an amoral AGI. We can use reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; eliminations to provide basic guidance. As a matter of reality, there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always be a minority of people who will inevitably disagree with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; selected Friendly super-goal. This is inescapable. If we don't assign a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specific Friendly super-goal, humanity will be destroyed by default.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much of humanity would you (plural/non-specific/rhetorical) recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you were the last representative of your kind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose you are cryopreserved throughout the mass uploading of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, or lost in space until being found by aliens (the old-school
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plot device)  When you wake up you are eased into the truth of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation by a &quot;Friendly&quot; (whatever that means) doctor.  Your behavior is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken as assumed to be the normative average for your species, and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; model of 21st century humanity is based on this assumption.  Through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion/exhumed memories of your (presumed-dead) friends, a model of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is created and you are reunited with them.  (Possibly with a story
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining how they were miraculously also &quot;saved&quot;)  Your reactions provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback to correct the difference between your model of your friend and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one running their simulation.  (of course, with sufficiently good memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scanning you wouldn't notice that this person is not exactly as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember)  Given an initially convincing portrayal of your friend, over time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your own model of them would reflect their new/current behavior.  Further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion of shared friends generates data to seed their reincarnation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After the proverbial six degrees of separation, everyone you can remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be regenerated as simulated 'peers' - Surely any group advanced enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually DO this can also infuse non-deterministic yet realistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors to cover the gaps in your memory and portray a convincing enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation of humanity that you may never learn that you are the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;real&quot; person from your time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this scenario, is humanity preserved?
