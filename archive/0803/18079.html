Me:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Heartland, High Priest of the Unique Atom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and Sacred Original Cult
</em><br>
<p>You:
<br>
<em>&gt; this is an ad hominem attack. 
</em><br>
<p>It you no longer think atoms and their “space time trajectories” (a term
<br>
almost as pompous as ad hominem) is instrumental in giving us
<br>
individuality, and if you no longer think there is a profound difference
<br>
between an original and its exact copy even though that difference can
<br>
not be detected objectively or subjectively then I will stop referring
<br>
to you as the High Priest of the Unique Atom and Sacred Original Cult.
<br>
