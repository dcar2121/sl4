</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Perhaps the words used here could be confusing. What I meant was, if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  think I have an experience of seeing red, then I have an experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  seeing red. You could argue that I am &quot;mistaken&quot; in my belief if I am

</em><br>
<p>Ok, that makes sense.  Although I think there might be another issue
<br>
here... in order to believe you have experience, you have to know what
<br>
experience is.  How could a machine be sure that what is going on in
<br>
its mind is similar enough to what humans call &quot;experience&quot; in order
<br>
to agree that it indeed has experience?  Also, how do we know that the
<br>
whole idea of &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;belief&quot; isn't just folk psychology
<br>
that will one day be replaced by a more rigorous formalism that
<br>
describes minds?  I agree that it's hard to imagine myself being
<br>
mistaken in the belief that I have experiences... but I wouldn't say
<br>
I'm completely sure it's completely impossible.  Maybe I'm mistaken,
<br>
and there isn't any such thing as experience... or there is something
<br>
like what we think of as experience, it's just not what we think it
<br>
is. I'm just throwing these out as possibilities... I think there are
<br>
far too many things we take for granted about our own minds that we
<br>
maybe shouldn't.
