<p><p><em>&gt; Since we're bringing in mathematical isomorphisms between systems (via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hash function and the game of life),
</em><br>
<p>Please see the second message in this thread, posted by me, on
<br>
Tuesday March 11, 2008 at 9:17 PM.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; let's consider a simpler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example: differentiating functions. Let S be some finite (though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly very large) set of polynomial functions, closed under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differentiation. The derivative is a map from S to itself. Via a hash
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function f, this is then seen as an abstract map from f(S) to itself.
</em><br>
<p>What Stuart is getting at, for those not too much into math,
<br>
is that the operation of &quot;taking a derivative&quot; can be seen as
<br>
analogous to &quot;calculating the next state&quot; in a TM (Turing Machine)
<br>
(e.g. general computer), or &quot;calculating the next generation&quot; on
<br>
a Life Board, where I should say that by a TM I am not talking
<br>
about the abstract set of quadruples or quintuples, but the 
<br>
idealized version of a little machine that runs up and down a
<br>
tape. (No more references in this post to TMs.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then what? Well, differentiation is connected with multiplication and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addition of functions. We can choose S to be sufficiently rich to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many examples of this. Via f, we get some complicated relations on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; f(S), and differentiation interacts with these relations (similarly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; localness can be phrased in terms of the image of the hash function;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's just a lot more complicated).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So far, I see no reason to consider that S and f(S) should be treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differently. Sure it's more complicated in f(S), but consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated anyway.
</em><br>
<p>I think, by the way, that below you do identify a difference, and
<br>
you may just be saying the opposite here for effect. (?)
<br>
<p>Before going further, I think that Stuart's mathematical example is
<br>
nothing short of glorious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see only two ways of distinguishing S and f(S), and the equivalents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the game of life: 1) The question asked and 2) The implicit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinity.
</em><br>
<p>But S, you said, was a finite subset of the infinite set of all polynomials.
<br>
I think that this is important later (below).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1) The question asked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you ask &quot;what is the derivative of this function?&quot;, you are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking the equivalent (but hideously complicated) [analogous] version
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in f(S). In fact that hideously complicated question has no meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless we know its simple equivalent.
</em><br>
<p>Has no meaning? It's still sort of a one-to-one function, (except for
<br>
the top polynomals, the top dogs, as it were, where there is no
<br>
inverse function, and except that 0 is the final &quot;state&quot;, the final end
<br>
of taking derivatives of elements of S, and except that g(x) + c
<br>
has the same derivative as g(x)).  But I deliberately suggested
<br>
the concept of &quot;one-to-one&quot; to help us understand the analogy in
<br>
that each state gives rise to a unique next state, just as in Conway's
<br>
Life, and just as in deterministic computer programs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, when we ask &quot;what is consciousness&quot;, we expect the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have meaning, while the hash function equivalent is meaningless.
</em><br>
<p>I really do totally---and admiringly---agree with where you are going
<br>
with this. I just am concerned about inserting the notion of &quot;meaning&quot;
<br>
here without further ado; also, my hunch is that it's an unnecessary
<br>
encumbrance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We can even formalise what we mean by meaning. &quot;What is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness&quot; is a complicated question, but we know the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlines of the answer (and it is not: the average wavelength
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the light hitting Io during a solar flare).
</em><br>
<p>Very good and amusing example  :-)   I do so wish everyone
<br>
would embroider their compositions with examples that enable
<br>
the poor reader to check his understanding and gain conviction
<br>
from redundancy.  But that's another rant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The answer, whatever it is, will have simpler, quasi answers -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incomplete but informative. The hash function equivalents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not be simpler than the hash function equivalent to the full
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>Darn.  I'm afraid that you're losing me here. What question? &quot;What
<br>
is consciousness?&quot;  Oh, dear.  I hope that your development here
<br>
is not contingent on arriving at an answer to that!  And what does
<br>
it mean for an answer to have simpler quasi-answers?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) The implicit infinity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Implicit in the definition of differentiation is the fact that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could differentiate any polynomial (with, say, rational coefficients).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The definition of differentiation to f(S) does not extend to infinity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this way; in fact, there is no evident extention of f(S).
</em><br>
<p>What?  Even if you have infinitely many polynomials, each has a
<br>
derivative, the only difference being that there is no &quot;top dog&quot;.
<br>
Strategically, would it have been better to stick with a crippled
<br>
definition of derivative, oh, something along the lines of either
<br>
&quot;we are not going to consider S to be infinite&quot;, or &quot;a qDerivative
<br>
is a derivative of a polynomial function, but the domain of 
<br>
qDerivative is by definition finite&quot;?  Or something like that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So our definition of &quot;differentiation&quot; somehow covers an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of cases, though it is defined finitely. A GLUT could not do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, well, GLUTs were never intended to, at least not in the applications
<br>
to which I ever put them (nor, if memory serves, anyone on the FoR
<br>
list, the SL4 list, or the Extropy list).
<br>
<p>I think that the whole infinity digression is a red-herring to your otherwise
<br>
brilliant analysis (and I don't often call what other posters do &quot;brilliant&quot;),
<br>
reserving that appellation strictly to apply to my own missives only.
<br>
<p>Gadzooks!  I'm eager to go away now and start thinking about how
<br>
your hash function of the polynomials does destroy &quot;locality&quot; (as I
<br>
originally used it here in this thread), and does destroy the causality
<br>
and information flow (in a certain sense that you've made somewhat
<br>
clear, at least to me) from one polynomial to the next.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stuart, proud sprouter of random thoughts since 2008.
</em><br>
<p>Your modesty is endearing, but so far as I can tell, entirely undeserved :-)
