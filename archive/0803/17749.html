<p><em>&gt;  &gt; You would be relying on an evolved intelligence having at least some

<em>&gt;  &gt; But there is no reason why the written language of an alien species
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; might not be, for example, based on the radioactive decay pattern of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; sacred stone, in which case to us a message would look completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; random.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But if they sent us one of their sacred stones, we would eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  find the non-random redundant pattern in the radioactive decay....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Great example. We would find the pattern because it is objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  there, and its Komolgorov complexity is less than that of a random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  string.
</em><br>
<p>I picked radioactive decay as an example of a truly random process
<br>
(you can predict the average number of decay events per unit time, but
<br>
not the actual number in a particular interval). It is effectively
<br>
what is called in cryptography a &quot;one time pad&quot;: you would find no
<br>
pattern in the sequence, and you would need a copy of the original
<br>
radioactive decay pattern to make sense of it, not just the stone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Similarly, an alien computer could seem to us completely random. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; need not even be a causal connection between the subcomponents of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; computation. A virtual environment in which you experience Monday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; could be run on computer A, and then Tuesday run on (completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; different) computer B in the Andromeda galaxy a billion years later at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; one billionth speed. As far as you're concerned, you experience Monday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; followed by Tuesday. You could be in a simulation in which every
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; second of experience is implemented on different hardware, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; different rates, different physical locations, in no particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; sequence, and you would have no way of knowing it. The shorter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; frames are, the more likely that a sequence of physical events
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; isomorphic to whatever hardware/software combination you specify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; arises by chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Isn't this analogous to the code-maker's efforts to change frequencies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  extremely often in order to thwart enemy decryption? But even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  those cases, if there really is a pattern there, sooner or later others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  break the code.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure that there *has* to be a pattern in the functioning of a
<br>
computer or whether it could instead be deliberately be designed with
<br>
the equivalent of a cryptographer's one-time pad. Suppose for the sake
<br>
of argument that there does have to be a pattern, which an intelligent
<br>
being after long observation could in theory crack. You could still
<br>
increase the randomisation by breaking up a computation into parts,
<br>
implementing the parts on computers with different (randomly chosen)
<br>
architecture, and shuffling them. The only discernible pattern might
<br>
then be within short runs of the one type of computer, and if the
<br>
period of the runs could be brought down to the length of one clock
<br>
cycle, we might be back to a situation where the one-time pad analogy
<br>
holds. In any case, having very short runs exponentially increases the
<br>
probability that an isomorphic system will occur somewhere by
<br>
accident.
