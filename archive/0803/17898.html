<p><em>&gt;  I am unaware of any logical paradoxes concerning personal identity. I

</em><br>
<p>They aren't actually logical paradoxes, but there is a problem when
<br>
you try to fit notions such as anticipation or subjective probability
<br>
into situations we did not encounter when our brains evolved:
<br>
<p>- Eliezer's example where you are duplicated 100-fold if a coin comes
<br>
up heads and then re-merged a short time later: what is the subjective
<br>
probability of heads?
<br>
<p>- Lee's example where you are duplicated and an hour later you (i.e.
<br>
one of the copies) are offered painless death so that the other copy
<br>
gets a large sum of money. Most people would probably not agree to
<br>
this, and yet it is subjectively equivalent to the situation where you
<br>
are offered the money if you agree to have a drug like midazolam,
<br>
which can cause amnesia for a similar period. I have never known
<br>
anyone to refuse midazolam for fear of the amnesia.
<br>
<p>- If 1000 copies of you are made in London lacking 50% of your
<br>
memories and 10 copies are made in Paris lacking 5% of your memories,
<br>
are you more likely to find yourself waking up in London or Paris?
<br>
<p>- You are offered two choices:
<br>
(a) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
<br>
Paris. The Paris copy is tortured while the London copies are not
<br>
tortured.
<br>
(b) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
<br>
Paris. After an hour, the 100 copies in London are tortured while the
<br>
copy in Paris is duplicated 100,000 times and none of these copies are
<br>
tortured.
<br>
Is your subjective probability of being tortured at the moment of the
<br>
original copying greater in (a) or (b)?
<br>
<p>Note that there is no problem *objectively* describing what happens in
<br>
any of these cases. Lee tries to take the objective point of view and
<br>
translate it into the subjective point of view as well. But to do this
<br>
would require a complete overthrow of our notions of anticipation and
<br>
subjective probability, and I don't think this is possible without
<br>
rewiring our brains.
