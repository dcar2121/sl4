<em>&gt; &gt; Could you devise a betting strategy (and an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; optimization target) in which using probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of 1/2 is better then 100/101 when implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by possible clones?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this thought experiment there are only 2 conscious beings not 101,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because 100 of them can be described by the same adjective. If one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those 100 happened to see a tail not a head then there would still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only two conscious beings because 99 could be described with one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjective and 2 could be described with another. It’s still a 50-50
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance.
</em><br>
<p>Consciousness is not relevant to expectation.  If an agent performs N
<br>
independent experiments and observes an outcome R times, and N is large, then
<br>
it applies probability theory to compute an expectation of R/N.  If you make
<br>
100 copies of an agent that sees heads and repeat the experiment 100 times,
<br>
then you end up with a lot of agents, most of whom saw 99 heads and 1 tails.
<br>
Never mind what they were told about fair coins.
<br>
<p>If you are copied 1000 times in London with 50% of your memories and 10 times
<br>
in Paris with 95% of your memories, then there will be 500 people in London
<br>
and 9.5 people in Paris who remember being copied.  If you repeat a bunch of
<br>
times and poll everyone who remembers the last N trials, they will tell you on
<br>
average that they ended up in London about 98% of the time.
<br>
<p>If you are copied 100 times and one copy is tortured, then repeat N times,
<br>
then a poll will show a 1% probability of being tortured per trial.  If you
<br>
torture 99 of the copies and make 100,000 copies of the other one, then a
<br>
similar poll will show a 0.1% probability of being tortured per trial.
<br>
<p>Exercises for the student.
<br>
<p>1. You are about to be tortured, after which the memory of the torture will be
<br>
erased.  What is your subjective probability that you will be tortured?
<br>
<p>2. N-1 copies of you are made.  A lottery is held among all N copies.  One
<br>
winner collects $1 million.  The other N-1 losers are killed by slow torture. 
<br>
What is the maximum price you should pay for N lottery tickets prior to being
<br>
copied (as a function of N)?
