<p><em>&gt; If this truly works then l should have the ice-9 of ethics and it should

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>As a collection of individual cells with a common interest in the continued
<br>
survival of the entity known as ME, I declare that several cells
<br>
unaffiliated with each other despite the name I categorically use to
<br>
describe Germs should be systematically destroyed using the most effective
<br>
chemicals available provided said chemicals pose negligible threat to the
<br>
primary goal of the survival of my own collective of Friendly cells.
<br>
Perhaps there are Friendly amoeba among the broadly defined Germs which have
<br>
neither the inkling or power to declare themselves Friendly yet have not
<br>
(through any definitive action) declared themselves to be UnFriendly
<br>
either.  Suppose the threat of Germs warrants the &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; of
<br>
chemicals also destroys some Ambivalent entities.  Have I committed wanton
<br>
UnFriendliness?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose now the collection of ME is a world government of humans
<br>
colonizing our solar system or the galaxy at large.  Those amoeba are now
<br>
individual aliens that have not yet reached OneWorld Civilization status.
<br>
Suppose they are each as capable an intelligence as yourself.  Would your
<br>
answer to wanton UnFriendliness be the same if we terraformed their
<br>
methane-based atmosphere to support human life?  What if They were doing it
<br>
to Us ?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Also suppose my definition of Friendly is just vastly different than
<br>
yours.  I can agree to be Friendly by my own terms - because that's all you
<br>
said you require for membership in the Friendly Group.  I simply spread the
<br>
my own meme of Friendly until your Group is has allied itself with my own,
<br>
then continue acting on my believes - subjugating your goals to those of the
<br>
Friendly Group that I have now undermined.  I do not willingly admit
<br>
wrongdoing in light of your accusations that I entered the Friendly Group
<br>
under false pretense because I honestly believe that I am righteously
<br>
spreading the Right Meme.  Your current declaration does not protect against
<br>
this kind of invasion.
