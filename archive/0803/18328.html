</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;normal, conscious part&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  One possibility is that only my speech centers are being

</em><br>
<p>I guess it is possible if only the lower motor neurons controlling
<br>
speech are normal and the rest of the brain is looked up that you
<br>
could be a complete zombie, since presumably lower motor neurons are
<br>
not involved in consciousness, or at any rate not very much
<br>
consciousness. But in the thought experiment we could identify every
<br>
neuron from the retina up that is involved in visual processing, and
<br>
replace these with looked up analogues. You would then have no visual
<br>
experience at all, but you would look at a picture of a dog,
<br>
accurately describe the picture, write an evocative poem about it, and
<br>
truly and honestly believe that you are looking at a picture of a dog;
<br>
while in fact you are completely bereft of any visual experience. If
<br>
you believe that this is possible, then you have to admit that you
<br>
have no evidence right now to support the theory that you are actually
<br>
seeing this email. You think you are, but if some medical
<br>
investigation shows that you have been blind for the last twenty years
<br>
without knowing it, you won't be able to dismiss it as absurd. And,
<br>
given that you have always enjoyed (or thought you enjoyed!) your
<br>
visual experiences, you might seriously consider an expensive and
<br>
slightly risky operation to restore your sight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; If you allow the possibility of partial zombification then you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; allow that not only can an external observer never know a person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; subjective experiences, but the person himself can never be sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; he is having the experiences he believes he is having. This seems a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; high price to pay in order to maintain that a LUC cannot be conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are entirely correct.  It is a high price. I wish I knew of any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  other way out. But it does not seem to me to be so high as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  price paid by you and others, namely, that only a tiny bit of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  consciousness is associated with a certain body in a certain city
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  on planet Earth, and that the vast, vast, vast majority of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  experience takes place in other objects, or---in another matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of speaking---doesn't take place at all, but only corresponds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to prior existing patterns existing only in Platonia.
</em><br>
<p>At least you see what you think of as an absurdity and adjust the
<br>
theory (functionalism) to remove the absurdity. Most philosophers and
<br>
cognitive scientists dismiss the apparent absurdity and simply carry
<br>
on as before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  Now, let me phrase my answer using an experiment so that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  no mistaking my meaning.  Question:  would you prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  (A)  to be tortured for an hour in the old-fashioned way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  (B)  for records of such an hour merely to be retrieved from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;        a galaxy far, far away a long time ago in which you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;        tortured just the same, and merely the states for that hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;        interval brought to Earth and at the proper moment merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;        looked up?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I guess it depends on whether the looking up of the records repeats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the experience which is what we are debating. If the recording were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; accurate down to the atomic level then yes, I think it would reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the same experience as the original.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To be precise, an entire state is swapped into the location where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reside once every trillionth of a second. None of the states is causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  connected to any of the others:  they could even have been retrieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  from extremely disparate and separated areas of intergalactic space,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by some random process that just happened to find patches of dust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (Those, by an amazing coincidence, do happen to be the same states
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that are now being computed, a trillion to the second, in the city where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you live, by the ordinary metabolic processes (computations).)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  So can you recapitulate and answer (A) or (B) for sure?  Thanks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  For of course, if your answer differs from mine, I have further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  questions.
</em><br>
<p>In that case, (A) and (B) would be equivalent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; The argument above proves that a functionally perfect simulation of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; brain must be as conscious as the brain *unless* partial zombification
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; is possible. The possibility of mind uploading is something else you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might have to give up if a LUC [looked up computation] cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; conscious.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Not at all.  Uploading is entirely orthogonal to the argument we're having.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The only feasible way to upload someone is to entirely simulate with near
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  perfect fidelity the actual computations his or her brain is already achieving.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Whether I or some part of me could in theory be &quot;looked up&quot; now is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  exactly the same issue as to whether some part of me could be &quot;looked up&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  after I'm uploaded.
</em><br>
<p>Someone could claim that a perfect simulation might behave like the
<br>
original, but it might be unconscious, or at least differently
<br>
conscious. This the layperson's usual response to the idea of mind
<br>
uploading. I claim that the argument whereby if part of your brain is
<br>
replaced by the simulation you could not possibly notice anything had
<br>
changed *proves* that the simulation must be conscious in exactly the
<br>
same way as biological tissue. But, according to you, this argument
<br>
proves nothing since it is possible to feel exactly the same while
<br>
undergoing a process of gradual zombification. If that's so then there
<br>
is no *proof* that an upload will be conscious in the same way as the
<br>
original. You might think that it sounds reasonable, but ultimately
<br>
you have to take it on faith. You also have to admit that you might be
<br>
at least partially a zombie right now, since feeling that you're all
<br>
conscious does not count as evidence that this is in fact the case.
