<p>Let's see.  I wrote

<p><em>        &gt; What determines how close a duplicate is to the original?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[An excellent question, by the way.]

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is similarity of structure, ultimately.  Of course, we have various
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measures of that (but we also have various yard-sticks that differ
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one from the other a little, and even meter-sticks, but we firmly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe in the utility of the 'length' concept, despite the dance of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;atoms going on in physical objects).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose that by some *obvious* [1] isomorphism,  today Lee is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one bit string
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11011011001110010110111111001010110100000011...
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tomorrow I am
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11011011001110010110011111001010110100000010...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where two 0's happen to be changed to 1's.  By all measures
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of similarity, those two strings are still very similar. (It would be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;easy to mention some particular measures used by mathematicians,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the ones I'm completely familiar with without having to go look
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them up aren't very applicable here.)
<br>
<p>I don't think that I *defined* exactly what &quot;similar&quot; means, (which is
<br>
usually a good idea not to try), but okay, so we know from countless
<br>
examples in daily life when two things are similar, or are comparatively
<br>
similar relative to some other comparison. The idea is for this very
<br>
commonplace notion to be supplemented by various &quot;measures&quot;
<br>
quite in analogy to how our ancestors' notions of hot and cold were
<br>
eventually supplemented by the development of the concept of 
<br>
temperature and various apparati (which google seems to think ok
<br>
for the plural form), such as thermometers. To be sure, this did not
<br>
exactly correspond with our ancestors' intuitions in all cases (for
<br>
example when they found water to feel very warm after they'd been
<br>
out in the cold a long time).
<br>
<p>Sorry if the preceding paragraph just belabors the obvious.
<br>
<p>Anyway, so information theorists looked for simpler structures in which
<br>
*similarity* might be easier to quantify.  Thus they came up with the
<br>
measures I alluded to.  Now I can sort of imagine this being extended
<br>
to more complex structures. Suppose we wanted to know as well as
<br>
we could how similar two electrical resistors were.  Assuming the
<br>
easiest case first, let's say that they weigh the same and have no gross
<br>
obvious differences, even to the point where the investigators suspect
<br>
that they may be almost *exactly* identical. 
<br>
<p>The next paragraph will show that I'm *not* a materials scientist! :-)
<br>
<p>They may be able to strip off micrometer thick cylindrical sections
<br>
and directly compare them to the &quot;same&quot; sections of the other. Let's
<br>
say that the first section of each was really a coat of paint. Now we
<br>
have (in principle, here, far from practice I think) two almost exactly
<br>
circular small, very thin disks, each mostly composed of paint. Next
<br>
they attempt to convert, or map, really, these to bit-strings. For 
<br>
instance, it might be found that if we create a grid whose squares
<br>
are .1 nanometer in length, that we could proceed to have 0 represent
<br>
no atom present, and 1 represent an atom present. It may turn out
<br>
that these two 2-dimensional grids are then somewhat similar---where
<br>
now we align the grid patterns as closely as possible, and do a kind
<br>
of &quot;file comparison&quot; (it is hoped that the reader has encountered
<br>
software that &quot;diff&quot; two files).
<br>
<p>A numerical measure of how similar two 1000x1000 grid patterns
<br>
or matrices can be done by a number of measures, but---and this
<br>
is the important point---there is a large class of such measures that
<br>
all yield approximately the same answer and correspond rather
<br>
well with our intuitive feelings (visual impressions) of how similar
<br>
two things are.
<br>
<p><p>Using a different strategy, but in the same way, I imagine that 3D
<br>
objects could also be &quot;gridded&quot; and then compared. I don't know
<br>
what the state of the art is among statisticians these days for doing
<br>
this kind of work, but it seems eminently reasonable and actually
<br>
rather straightforward (to me).
<br>
<p>Any closer to understanding how I think that in principle physical
<br>
objects could be mapped to bit strings?
<br>
<p>Oh, and one last point.   When sending signals into space bit by
<br>
bit (literally) some scientists have hit upon the idea of sending
<br>
a composite number of pixels (bits), like whatever 2999x3001
<br>
is.  Now both 2999 and 3001 are prime, and so it's supposed
<br>
to occur to some alien that they ought to try to make an almost
<br>
square out of it. Then behold!  Straight lines and even pictures
<br>
emerge.  It's not really too different an idea from how TV
<br>
images are scanned, I guess.
<br>
<p>Anyway, hope this helps explain what I was getting at, and
<br>
your question is good enough that it warranted a new thread.
<br>
I'll address the rest of your post in the old thread.
<br>
<p>Respectfully,
<br>
Lee
