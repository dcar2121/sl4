<em>&gt; He said it on April 21 2006 on the Extropian list. I guess it's OK to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give an exact quote as it's in publicly available archives:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Your instance of mind process would die  either from mind stopping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caused by anesthetic or mind stopping caused by natural death.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since then I have thrown this quote back in his face at least a dozen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times, probably more, and he has never once denied saying it. I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told him that even the best of us can say stupid things from time to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and if he retracts that comment I will say no more about it, but he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  John K Clark
</em><br>
<p>There's no reason to retract it. The sentence still makes perfect sense (at least
<br>
to me) if you are careful not to skip any words in it. I guess the word &quot;mind&quot; can
<br>
be too distracting (it's too precious to people) which can lead someone to miss the
<br>
point(s) of the quote. Perhaps, if I replaced &quot;mind&quot; with something like &quot;flight&quot;
<br>
or &quot;motion&quot;, these points/ideas would come more into focus. So, how about, &quot;*This*
<br>
INSTANCE of &quot;motion&quot; TYPE ceases to exist when *this* moving object of
<br>
&quot;capableOfMovement&quot; TYPE comes to a rest (the object explodes, hits the wall,
<br>
engine suddenly freezes and the object slows down to a stop)&quot;? Then, the same
<br>
sentence with &quot;motion&quot; replaced by &quot;mind&quot; would look something like, &quot;*This*
<br>
INSTANCE of &quot;mind&quot; TYPE ceases to exist when *this* hardware of
<br>
&quot;capableOfMindProcessing&quot; TYPE stops functioning (the hardware explodes, loses
<br>
power, the OS &quot;freezes&quot; :-) )&quot;. Still nothing?
<br>
<p>Well, the bottom line is (I strongly believe) that to survive means to preserve the
<br>
instance of life, not the type of life. Type is a meaningless concept.
<br>
My neighbor and I both share &quot;human&quot; type, yet not even the pattern camp would
<br>
agree that a deceased neighbor survives in me just because we share &quot;human&quot; type.
<br>
The degree to which something dead is similar to something living should be equally
<br>
irrelevant to the survival of the dead thing. It's because types are abstract,
<br>
arbitrary and imaginary while instances are real (have physical manifestations) and
<br>
measurable. There would be no types without instances. Type is what you
<br>
artificially assign after you have an instance. It's merely a symbol representing a
<br>
real thing, not the actual thing. Type is a big red herring. ;-)
