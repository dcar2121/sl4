</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's just what I would argue. But I think you can still
<br>
understand what I mean if I contrast altruistic selfishness with
<br>
selfish selfishness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Most people will in fact, I claim, sacrifice their subjective well-being
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, but leaving aside the question of whether this is really selfish
<br>
or not, it still involves subjectivity. No-one is going to sacrifice
<br>
anything in pursuit of a goal that leaves them completely unmoved. But
<br>
perhaps as you said in a response to Nick this isn't problematic if
<br>
subjectivity is equated with experience.
