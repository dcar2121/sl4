<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]     hey, Slawek, how come you don't put attributions at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                        appropriate places in your posts---at least lately?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's focus on this because this is where you are assuming what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm asking you to explain. Why is it important to be *like*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; something? As before, concept of  &quot;survival&quot; cannot be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; in the explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I haven't answered your last question. I sort of have to throw up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; my hands. I cannot explain why you don't want to be like certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; deformed people who have two heads, and I can't explain why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you don't want to be &quot;like&quot; a rodent. We have to start somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Slawek.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying that preserving &quot;likeness&quot; is important because creatures that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not like you experience lower quality of life?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly not.  I know people who experience much higher quality
<br>
of life than I do.  I'm surprised you'd make that particular guess.
<br>
Can't you imagine how inane or dumb it would sound if I were
<br>
to say &quot;Yes. Yes, people and other things who are not me 
<br>
experience lower qualities of life than I do&quot;?
<br>
<p>But---sorry---as I said before, we do have to make sure that
<br>
there is not something really basic we're miscommunicating about.
<br>
So---I'm not really offended or annoyed at the question, &lt;sigh&gt;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There *are* other things I can be attached to, you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *This* instance of mind process responsible for perception and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making sense of the world around me.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  Okay, now I remember that from our discussions a year
<br>
or two back.  What riles up JC and some others, perhaps, is that
<br>
under anaesthesia, perhaps you believe your &quot;instance of mind
<br>
process&quot; is ended?  
<br>
<p>Or is that another canard?   :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, so what does that tell you about importance of runtime vs. memories? You
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; could have had all your memories intact forever and yet you didn't choose this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; option. Interesting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As heaven is my witness, I have never in the last 40 years dismissed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what today I call runtime or processing!  As you say, the memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; without any possibility whatsoever in all the future history of the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; getting runtime are totally worthless to me.  I have said that again and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; again, I'm pretty sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Good, so can I infer from this that having runtime is also at least as important to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you as maintaining the same memories?
</em><br>
<p>They're not directly comparable.  It would be like asking someone about
<br>
their favorite Elvis Presley album---oops, showing my age---CD. The
<br>
question &quot;which is more important, that that CD actually exists or that
<br>
you get to listen to it now and then?&quot;  is kind of equivalent, to me.
<br>
<p>To me, the memories can be retained &quot;off-line&quot; just as Elvis's voice
<br>
can be (e.g. on a CD).  Human memories---all of us uploaders think
<br>
---in some form or another can be preserved WITHOUT necessarily
<br>
getting much, if any, runtime.  The analogy:  You can keep that CD
<br>
around indefinitely, but never play it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Oh, you are referring to Reagan's amnesia. People close to him said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that he had died bit by bit in the preceding months or years. Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; makes perfect sense, given what we know.  What was being celebrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; was his whole life and his whole record, as you know. His deanimation was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just a convenient and very traditional point at which to &quot;celebrate&quot; his passing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If on June 4th 2004 you asked anyone in the world whether Reagan was still alive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost everyone would reply &quot;yes.&quot;  I'm not trying to argue that your definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; death is wrong because of this. I'm only trying to point out that your definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of death (where death=amnesia) is quite exotic to most people. I doubt Reagan's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends and family thought he was actually dead on June 4th 2004. I bet they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought he was very sick, and couldn't remember much, but not dead.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  The friends and family used society's and language's conventions
<br>
in this regard, no matter what they privately thought. Language is for
<br>
communication, after all.  If questioned closely, many would concede
<br>
that he'd died slowly bit by bit, and was almost dead already. &lt;Insert
<br>
mini-lecture on the way that &quot;alive/dead&quot; dicotomy doesn't capture
<br>
what is the real continuum very well, and that the cryonics literature,
<br>
for one place, goes into great detail about all this by very thorough,
<br>
intelligent, and sensible people&gt;
<br>
<p>Have I answered all your questions yet?  Please reply, because I have
<br>
some of my own.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
