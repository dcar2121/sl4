</em><br>
<p>I don't know how you estimated it, but if you really got the right
<br>
answer it seems like it must have been pure coincidence.  The number
<br>
of standing wave patterns scales with volume, whereas the
<br>
Bekenstein-Bousso bound scales with area.  The holographic principle
<br>
implies that there are a lot of hidden correlations between different
<br>
possible standing wave patterns, because of their effects on spacetime
<br>
itself... making any estimate based on standing waves meaningless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It is rather interesting that the volume of a bit is about that of a proton or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  neutron, but S does not depend on the properties of any particles.
</em><br>
<p>The area of a bit is 10^-69 m^2, which is roughly 1 Planck length
<br>
squared.  There is no fixed &quot;volume of a bit&quot;, as the number of bits
<br>
is not proportional to volume.  If you're just taking the volume of
<br>
the universe and dividing it by the volume of a baryon, it's not very
<br>
meaningful, because you can definitely have a lot more than 1 bit
<br>
inside the volume of a baryon.  It's just that once you take into
<br>
account all of the weird gravitational correlations throughout
<br>
spacetime, you find that there are less bits total than you'd expect
<br>
from a volume-based count.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It has always puzzled me why the universe didn't collapse into a black hole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  shortly after the big bang if it had the same mass as today.
</em><br>
<p>A black hole is defined as a region of space from which light cannot
<br>
escape.  Comparing the Schwarzchild radius to the radius taken up by
<br>
some amount of matter/energy is only a rule of thumb, not a hard &quot;law
<br>
of physics&quot;.  In particular, it only applies to static spacetimes,
<br>
where space is not expanding.  When space is expanding or contracting,
<br>
it provides other ways for light to escape.  In a universe with no
<br>
dark energy, where the density of matter is less than the critical
<br>
density, space will expand forever, and there will be no event
<br>
horizons (black holes) and light will not get trapped in any
<br>
particular region.  If the density of matter is greater than the
<br>
critical density, then the universe will eventually collapse back onto
<br>
itself and &quot;big crunch&quot; which I suppose you could regard as similar to
<br>
a black hole but as far as I know it's not usually called that.
<br>
<p>In our universe however, which contains dark energy, the situation is
<br>
different.  There *is* an event horizon about 16-billion light years
<br>
away.  (Note that it's a bit further away than 13-billion lightyears,
<br>
the Hubble horizon, but not as far as the current &quot;radius of the
<br>
visible universe&quot; which is 45-billion lightyears... the distance to
<br>
the furthest objects we can currently see).  This event horizon is
<br>
created by the fact that the expansion is accelerating, which traps
<br>
light in a region of size 16-billion lightyears (and this region is
<br>
currently shrinking).  So in a sense, we *are* in a black hole.
<br>
Although it's again usually not said that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                                                                                                       It also puzzles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  me that a black hole is not symmetric with respect to time (stuff goes in but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not out) even though Einstein's general field equations are.  Shouldn't there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  be another solution with the opposite sign, one where stuff goes out but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in, like an expanding universe?  In that case, dark energy is just gravity?
</em><br>
<p>Yup... good intuition.  There is such a solution, and the technical
<br>
term for it is a &quot;white hole&quot;.  If you interpolate between a black
<br>
hole and a white hole, you get a wormhole that appears to dump matter
<br>
from one universe into another.  It goes in the black hole on one
<br>
side, and out the white hole on the other.  Unlike black holes, they
<br>
are purely theoretical... nobody has ever seen evidence for them in
<br>
the sky.  But as you say, they do exist mathematically in GR.
<br>
However, I would urge caution to anyone getting excited about white
<br>
holes or wormholes because they are solutions to classical GR and are
<br>
not necessarily consistent with quantum mechanics (ie, quantum
<br>
gravity).  Most theoretical physicists are very skeptical that they
<br>
could really exist.
