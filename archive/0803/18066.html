<p>
If I understand Mark's proposal (which he claims I don't), it is that a group
<br>
of agents that cooperate with each other have greater fitness than a group of
<br>
agents that fight among themselves.  On this point I agree, but it defines
<br>
Friendliness very broadly.  Humans have no special status.  I described on the
<br>
AGI list a possible outcome where the Earth is transformed into a Dyson sphere
<br>
of gray goo devoid of DNA based life.  According to Mark's definition, this
<br>
outcome is Friendly because the nanobots are cooperating.  He at least did not
<br>
post any objection.
<br>
<p>This is not my objection either.  (The nanobots are achieving their goals, and
<br>
since nothing else is alive, their opinions are the only ones that matter). 
<br>
My objection is that evolution is not a stable process.  It lies on the border
<br>
between stability and chaos.  It is punctuated by mass extinctions, plagues,
<br>
and other catastrophes.  A state where there is no competition is the worst
<br>
kind of catastrophe.  Without competition between groups (e.g. wars), there is
<br>
no evolutionary pressure to maintain goals that promote group survival.
<br>
<p>But maybe that's just my own evolutionary programmed goals telling me that
<br>
survival is desirable.
