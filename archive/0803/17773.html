<p>I can't be mistaken about having what I personally call &quot;experience&quot;,
<br>
even if it is different to what you or a computer might mean by that
<br>
term. The only way I could be mistaken if there is some objective
<br>
standard against which putative experiences could be measured, and
<br>
that isn't possible even in theory.
