<p>
Exactly.  I think the only reason John Clark and Vladimir Nesov are
<br>
coming to idiotic conclusions here is because they think that
<br>
anticipation is subjective or tied in with consciousness or identity.
<br>
While they can come up with whatever bizarre definition for identity
<br>
or consciousness they like, it really doesn't tell you anything
<br>
meaningful, because they are only talking about something subjective
<br>
(viewing someone as an &quot;adjective&quot; for instance).  You can believe
<br>
whatever you want about identity, since at heart it's not really a
<br>
meaningful concept, and neither is subjective anticipation.  But you
<br>
*cannot* believe whatever you want about objective anticipation.
<br>
Anticipating the wrong thing is going to cause most of your copies to
<br>
behave the wrong way.

<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; Could you devise a betting strategy (and an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; optimization target) in which using probability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; of 1/2 is better then 100/101 when implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &gt; by possible clones?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; In this thought experiment there are only 2 conscious beings not 101,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; because 100 of them can be described by the same adjective. If one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; those 100 happened to see a tail not a head then there would still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; only two conscious beings because 99 could be described with one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; adjective and 2 could be described with another. It's still a 50-50
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Consciousness is not relevant to expectation.  If an agent performs N
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  independent experiments and observes an outcome R times, and N is large, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it applies probability theory to compute an expectation of R/N.  If you make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  100 copies of an agent that sees heads and repeat the experiment 100 times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  then you end up with a lot of agents, most of whom saw 99 heads and 1 tails.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Never mind what they were told about fair coins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you are copied 1000 times in London with 50% of your memories and 10 times
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in Paris with 95% of your memories, then there will be 500 people in London
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and 9.5 people in Paris who remember being copied.  If you repeat a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  times and poll everyone who remembers the last N trials, they will tell you on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  average that they ended up in London about 98% of the time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  If you are copied 100 times and one copy is tortured, then repeat N times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  then a poll will show a 1% probability of being tortured per trial.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  torture 99 of the copies and make 100,000 copies of the other one, then a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  similar poll will show a 0.1% probability of being tortured per trial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Exercises for the student.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1. You are about to be tortured, after which the memory of the torture will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  erased.  What is your subjective probability that you will be tortured?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  2. N-1 copies of you are made.  A lottery is held among all N copies.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  winner collects $1 million.  The other N-1 losers are killed by slow torture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  What is the maximum price you should pay for N lottery tickets prior to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  copied (as a function of N)?
</em><br>
