<p><em>&gt;  Option 1) In 1 minute you will go into an eternal coma. On the bright side, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  guaranteed that your brain, and thus your memories, will remain exactly the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  they are now until the end of Universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Option 2) In 1 minute all your personal memories will be completely erased from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  your brain, but, other than that, this brain will function just like any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  healthy brain that's able to form and retain new personal memories and remember all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the general knowledge acquired throughout the brain's life, like being able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  speak, read and write English, do math, etc. However, this brain will not remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  its name, its opinions, its family and friends, its tastes, where it's located,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  none of that personal stuff.
</em><br>
<p>Option 2 is equivalent to my dying and an unrelated person with no
<br>
memories but a brain similar to mine (like a clone) being created.
<br>
This is not much better from a selfish point of view than option 1,
<br>
where I die and there is no replacement. Static memories aren't really
<br>
any good: consciousness involves a series of related memories.
