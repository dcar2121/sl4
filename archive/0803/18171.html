Wow!  
<br>
<p>&quot;allow me to address what I think you're (rightly)
<br>
really getting to:  what if the AI just dreams up a whole scenario
<br>
having no other referent outside its own imagination?
<br>
&quot;
<br>
<p>Imagination!   &quot;Its&quot; own?  That in and of itself out weighs this entire argument.  
<br>
Can of worms open.

<p><p><em>&gt; Lee wrote:

<em>&gt;&gt;  I now rather think, by the way, that Stathis maybe should have said &quot;No,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I'm being *implemented* in Platonia&quot;.  And he might have corrected my

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the rock and I are on an equal footing, we're both being *implemented*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in Platonia&quot;.  Of course, I don't know yet if that's what Stathis might really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  have thought or agreed with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, OK: the simulation or the emulation is being implemented on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer somewhere, maybe the big Turing machine in Platonia.
</em><br>
<p>Hmm. I suspect that the rock and you are *simply* being implemented.
<br>
and  suspect that there are no emulations or simulations evident here. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if there's no &quot;original&quot; do we call it a simulation or an emulation?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that we do so call it.  That is, we normally have a case
<br>
that &quot;A simulates B&quot;, or &quot;A emulates B&quot;.  In each, we are referring
<br>
to a larger or more basic machine that simulates or emulates a
<br>
smaller or simpler machine. (But see below.)
<br>
<p>Now what I just wrote can be taken literally if we believe MWI.
<br>
That's because whatever &quot;simulation&quot; the AI dreams up, it really
<br>
did happen in some other universe. But let's forget that for a 
<br>
moment, and allow me to address what I think you're (rightly)
<br>
really getting to:  what if the AI just dreams up a whole scenario
<br>
having no other referent outside its own imagination?
<br>
<p>Well, in that case, I suggest, we may be using the word &quot;simulation&quot;
<br>
in yet another way, one that does not relate very closely to the 
<br>
CS usage.  If people found that we are all living in a simulation
<br>
that was not a historical re-creation, but just entirely a figment of
<br>
the AI's imagination, then they'd be using the term as in &quot;what 
<br>
we are living in is an *imitation* of an actual sort of existence&quot;.
<br>
That is, *this only &quot;simulates&quot; or &quot;imitates&quot;, &quot;parodies&quot;, &quot;impersonates&quot;,
<br>
etc., some real Earth made of real rocks and trees, that actually
<br>
does not exist in the Milky Way galaxy or anywhere else in a
<br>
small finite universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We do refer to virtual worlds as &quot;simulations&quot; even when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they aren't actually simulating anything;
</em><br>
<p>Right. Have I captured what you are saying here in my own
<br>
words above?  I also always read that as &quot;We are being simulated,
<br>
or we are living in a simulation&quot; as also implying &quot;There is some
<br>
bottom level process of which we are unaware that is a more
<br>
basic reality, and that our level is just another level being imitated
<br>
more or less by the lower level.&quot;  (Or by perhaps any large finite
<br>
number of levels, each one implementing the level above it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; can we than have an emulation of a simulation?
</em><br>
<p>Interesting.  Let me see.  On my usage of terms, a simulation
<br>
of Abraham Lincoln would appear to everyone's consternation
<br>
in Washington D.C. tomorrow, and quickly convince historians
<br>
that he was the real McCoy.  But the truth would be that either
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) a hidden AI, vastly more intelligent than people, was just
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulling his strings. Rather than actually having its own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughts and feelings, the Lincoln would be merely outwardly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exhibiting false signs of them.  The AI might reside in a tiny,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tiny microchip embedded in the Lincoln's pineal gland, say :-)
<br>
or
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(ii) an uncannily talented actor really was fooling everyone. Though
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the actor has thoughts and feelings of his own, he's just imitating
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the historical Lincoln's, not actually feeling the real Lincoln's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emotions nor having the real Lincoln's moral concerns, etc.
<br>
or
<br>
<p>(iii) Our whole world is being &quot;simulated&quot; by some AI with a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fanciful imagination (the sort usually being referred to people
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they say &quot;*this is a simulation&quot;), but all the rest of us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are real in the sense that we are independent modules in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the AI's implementation of Earth. We really have our own
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feelings, independent thoughts, etc., except for the 2008
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lincoln, who is a simulation as in (i) and (ii).
<br>
<p>Now your question 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; can we than have an emulation of a simulation?
</em><br>
<p>might mean several things.  On (i) above, it would mean that an even
<br>
vaster (or more basic level AI) was emulating the first AI who is
<br>
imbedded in the ersatz Lincoln together with the rest of the ersatz
<br>
Lincoln's body.  The AI in Lincoln's pineal gland would have no
<br>
clue that he was really being emulated, say, on an Intel 4000086
<br>
chip, by the Microsoft 2050 version of whatever OS bloatware
<br>
they have going by then, probably &quot;DreamyVista version 2050&quot;,
<br>
or some other horrible name.  The AI in the Lincoln's pineal
<br>
gland believes that he has actual access to the hardware level,
<br>
i.e., that &quot;he&quot; is the OS.
<br>
<p>On (ii), the case of the uncannily talented actor just arrived in
<br>
Washington D.C. who has fooled *everybody*,  an emulation
<br>
is easy:  some machine just uploads the actor in a few microseconds
<br>
and runs the emulation, the &quot;interior&quot; or computer version running
<br>
exactly in parallel with the real actor.  The actor has been emulated.
<br>
<p>On (iii), where our whole world is a simulation not necessarily 
<br>
having any actual, real historical predecessor, and only the Lincoln
<br>
is simulated (the rest of us being real in the simulation), then making
<br>
an emulation of the Lincoln means, I guess, just another simulation,
<br>
Lincoln2.  But that's problematic, since Lincoln depends on the 
<br>
same calculations done by whatever is simulating our whole Earth.
<br>
Maybe an &quot;emulation of a simulation&quot; here would mean just another
<br>
copy of the Lincoln simulation. The picture is clear---but the words
<br>
to describe it don't appear to be too easy to find.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  So I will continue to insist that the goal of uploading is to emulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a human consciousness, not simulate it, and we need some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of terminological distinction for this, if not the one I've been pushing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  on this list and Extropians for five or ten years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes. But apparently there are some, such as Jeff L. Jones, who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work hard to overcome this bias. I think that that would be like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; working hard to overcome a fear of death.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, sorry.  I had missed that you and Jeff were disagreeing. Well, in
<br>
that case I'm with you naturally, since (if you have characterized his
<br>
position correctly) I certainly don't want to overcome any &quot;bias&quot;
<br>
that I exist, have a life, and am a person.  But to be literal---I don't
<br>
have a fear of death.  I just think the more runtime I get, the better.
<br>
(E.g., if right now I'm just a copy on a planet orbiting Sirius of the
<br>
real Lee who is in California, and I learn (unlike the California Lee)
<br>
that I was brought into existence on this planet orbiting Sirius for
<br>
the sole purpose of giving Lee two extra hours of runtime.  The
<br>
remote Lee on Sirius would say, &quot;Well, two hours was better than
<br>
nothing.  My sincere thanks for giving them to me.&quot;
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. Apolgies to Philip K. Dick who used a &quot;Lincoln&quot; very much
<br>
as in one of the scenarios above in his novel &quot;We Can Build You&quot;.
<br>
<p>P.P.S.  Sorry I'm so far behind reading the great posts on this list.
