<em>&gt;  &gt; might.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do take this as a direct implantation on the Life Board's version
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of our V1 visual processing center.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Next, a change is made to a patch of the Board so that those

<em>&gt;  &gt; squares are looked up rather than calculated. This patch is large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; enough that it causes the theorised diminution in conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then this is probably not the example you want. If I'm seeing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  dog and the experimenters who have computer access to my V1
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  make a perfect substitute, then naturally I can't even see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  difference. The hardest part for us to try to deal with here is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that starting with V1 and going all &quot;the way up&quot;, there isn't any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  clear dividing line between the person's &quot;mind&quot; and the outside.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But I still think that you'll have to aim higher  :-)  than V1 here.
</em><br>
<p>You can go up as high as you feel is necessary. You suggested that a
<br>
1000x1000 patch of the Board that was looked up rather than calculated
<br>
might cause a small deficit in consciousness. If that's not enough
<br>
then imagine that half the Board is looked up and the other half
<br>
calculated: surely that should be noticeable?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; The emulation is still looking at the dog and describing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; what it is seeing as the change is made. What happens?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; If there is a change in consciousness then the emulation notices that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the picture has suddenly gone blurry, or one of the dog's legs has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; disappeared, or whatever (we can imagine that the looked-up patch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; increases in size until the change in visual perception becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; noticeable). So, as per your instructions, the emulation tries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; report this change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't know what the point is here that you're trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  get to. A brutal change is of course going to affect the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  states of the &quot;subject&quot;.  That is, in the sequence Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a sudden substitution of Sm' for Sm may not be alarming to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the subject---he doesn't know that Sm' was not supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to occur---but as he reports his experiences, presumably,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the description becomes different from what it would have been.
</em><br>
<p>The states - the patterns of squares - are not affected; what is
<br>
affected is the way the patterns are generated. You have argued that
<br>
if a sufficiently large patch of the Board is looked up rather than
<br>
calculated, this will affect the quality of the experience. For
<br>
reasons as below, I don't see how this is possible. I think we are
<br>
forced to conclude that looking up an arbitrarily large proportion of
<br>
the Board, up to 100%, will make no difference at all to the emulated
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; However, there is a problem: the squares on the Board which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; interface with the loudspeaker are *exactly the same* as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; they would have been if the looked-up patch had actually been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; calculated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, there we go. This is closer to the crux.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; So the emulation would be saying, &quot;It's the same picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; of a dog, try looking up a larger patch of squares&quot;, while thinking,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;Oh no, I'm going blind, and my mouth is saying stuff all on its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; own!&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, wait.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; But how is this possible unless you posit a disembodied soul,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; which becomes decoupled from the emulation and goes on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; have its own separate thoughts?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course. There are no souls, and if you perfectly substitute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  an entirely different set of pixel values over some region of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the board, the calculation nonetheless proceeds exactly as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; The other possibility is that there is a change to visual perception
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; which is not actually noticed. When all the squares relating to visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; perception are looked up the emulation becomes blind, but it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; realise it's blind and continues to accurately describe what is shown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; to it, using zombie vision. This is almost as implausible, and begs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the question of what it means to perceive something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I totally agree. Such a distinction is beneath you and me :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  As I say, *all* my visual inputs could be looked up rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  faithfully passed in by my retina along all those nerve fibers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Naturally I'd never know, (unless what I was seeing was starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to clash with my other senses).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; The above is a variation on Chalmers' &quot;Fading Qualia&quot; argument:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that Chalmers almost by definition can never find what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is looking for, because any explanation would fail to satisfy him
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  either for one reason, or if that doesn't work, then a new one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I'm afraid that an explanation would have to *make* Chalmers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  feel conscious, or feel an experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Extremely hypothetical guess:  if you took the set of all 26^500
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  explanations of 500 characters in length, not one of them would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  satisfy those who insist that there is an insoluble  mystery to the matter.

<p>The quoted paper has nothing whatsoever to do with the &quot;hard problem&quot;
<br>
(if that's what you were referring to). It is an argument that,
<br>
whatever consciousness may be, it should be possible to generate it in
<br>
a suitably configured non-biological substrate. The only
<br>
(naturalistic) way to avoid this conclusion is if the brain contains
<br>
fundamentally non-computable physics, and there is no evidence that it
<br>
does.
