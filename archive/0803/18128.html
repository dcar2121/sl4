<em>&gt; &gt; primitive world, not a world where we can have everything we want.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want 1000 permanent orgasms or a simulated fantasy world with a magic

<em>&gt; &gt; genie,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efficiently as gray goo and your body and world are simulated?  You're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; going to know.  Does this count as extinction?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the person being &quot;re-implemented&quot; believes so, then yes.  In that case, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are clearly messing with their goals of not being extinct.  You can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely sure that your &quot;re-implementation&quot; truly is exactly the same and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the subject wouldn't know or realize.  Doing this against someone's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will is evil.
</em><br>
<p>Getting the re-implementation correct is an intelligence problem.  If you
<br>
still have any doubts, the nanobots will go into your brain and remove them. 
<br>
You will believe whatever you are programmed to believe.  If you are opposed
<br>
to being reprogrammed, the nanobots will move some more neurons around to
<br>
change your mind about that too.  It can't be evil if everyone is in favor of
<br>
it.
<br>
<p>Look, the AI is smarter than you and knows what's best for you.  If you
<br>
persist in your stubbornness and continue to waste the AI's resources, it will
<br>
simply declare you UnFriendly and do it anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But we don't really have a choice over whether there is competition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; groups or not.  My bigger concern is the instability of evolution, like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plague or population explosion that drastically changes the environment 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reduces the diversity of life.  Some of the proposals for controlling the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outcome of a singularity depend on a controlled catastrophe by setting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; initial dynamic in the right direction.  This is risky because 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; catastrophes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are extremely sensitive to initial conditions.  But of course we are in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; midst of one now, a mass extinction larger than any other in the last 3.5
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; billion years.  We lack the computing power to model it, and there is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to acquire it in time because the process itself is needed to produce it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it always stays a step ahead.  Sorry for the bad news.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Um, I'm missing the bad news (or, at least, how it relates to my proposal). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you please clarify?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, our long discussion on whether it is better to have one group of
<br>
cooperating agents or competition between groups is moot.  Whether there is
<br>
one group or many depends on the outcome of a catastrophe.  We don't have a
<br>
choice in the matter.
