<p>Good point, although I feel that Turing Machines are a lot more useful
<br>
to think about than GLUTs.  They can answer all sorts of questions
<br>
about what problems can or cannot be solved... since they are the
<br>
infinite limit of a series of finite machines that *can* be built, and
<br>
are physical.  GLUTs on the other hand aren't the infinite limit of
<br>
anything that could be used to pass a Turing test, or could be said to
<br>
&quot;implement consciousness&quot;.  I guess you could argue that finite tape
<br>
Turing machines, if they are thought to be literally a piece of paper
<br>
sliding through a device, will always be way too slow to pass a Turing
<br>
test.  But I don't think the piece of paper sliding through a device
<br>
is the essence of what the Turing machine is about... I don't think
<br>
it's unreasonable to believe you could make one fast enough to
<br>
implement consciousness if you used nanobots for the device and giant
<br>
strings of molecules for the tape.  The tape size would be finite, but
<br>
other than that it would really *be* a conscious Turing machine.  I
<br>
don't see any analogue of that for GLUT's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I have always liked the GLUT as a device because it forces people to

</em><br>
<p>I admit, that it does have this appeal.
