</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how it could feel different to be implemented without vs.
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just different.
</em><br>
<p>What causal chain?  Among one dust patch here and another there?
<br>
<p>Computation is a *process*.  As wikipedia puts it
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computation is a general term for any type of information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processing that can be represented mathematically. This includes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phenomena ranging from human thinking to calculations with a more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;narrow meaning. Computation is a process following a well-defined
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model that is understood and can be expressed in an algorithm,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protocol, network topology, etc.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I am a &quot;time chauvinist&quot;, and believe that our best physics theories
<br>
and our best epistemology are grounded in the notion of *time*.
<br>
<p>But others differ. Some don't see a central role for time, but
<br>
believe it to be derivative. So then they're stuck patches of
<br>
dust here and there in the cosmos being conscious (or at
<br>
least &quot;doing computations&quot;) and all that. To me, it's as wrong
<br>
as having a child in Australia write &quot;2+2 =&quot; on a whiteboard
<br>
and coincidentally having a child in Hungary writing a &quot;4&quot; on
<br>
a different whiteboard. So what if an &quot;answer&quot; pops up 
<br>
somewhere in the universe?  If there is no causal connection,
<br>
no information flow, then it amount to nothing at all.
<br>
<p>But I grant than many differ, and the question almost surely
<br>
has no resolution that will be accepted by all---unless there
<br>
is a huge physics breakthrough of some kind, I suppose.
<br>
