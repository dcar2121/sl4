<p><em>&gt; I think we may be talking about slightly different things. To restate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem, we have two separate computers which are going to run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monday and Tuesday, respectively, of a person's life. If the final
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of Monday is transferred to the second machine, by any reliable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means, so that Tuesday can be computed, then my understanding is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would agree that there is no break in the stream of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the person being simulated (assuming he is staying up late).
</em><br>
<p>Correct---indeed I would so agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, if the run on the second computer starts with initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state not causally connected to the first computer, even if by chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it turns out that this starting state is in fact the one that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have occurred had the causal connection been present, then your claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that there will be a discontinuity in consciousness between Monday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Tuesday.
</em><br>
<p>Infinitesimal, but yes.
<br>
<p>Now let's be *very* careful here.  Your Sj is the last state of Monday
<br>
and Sm is the first state of Tuesday, where Sj -&gt; Sm is the usual 
<br>
calculation depending locally and reductionistically on the information
<br>
flow between Sj and Sm. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, to just carry Sj over to Tuesday and *start*
<br>
Tuesday with Sj defeats the most important part of our TE.
<br>
Clearly, if Tuesday starts with Sj---no matter how obtained,
<br>
no consciousness not even for a pico second is interrupted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My problem with this latter position is that, apart from being an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unnecessary complication, there is no way to specify what counts as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causal link and no obvious mechanism whereby the absence or presence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this link could affect the consciousness of the computation. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, what happens if the transfer of information occurs by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend passing you a number of files of which only one is the correct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one. If you guess right does that count as information transfer?
</em><br>
<p>What is on those files?  If it is Sm on those files, well, where did
<br>
Sm come from?  By chance?  In that case, there was an infinitesimal
<br>
absence of consciousness in the person being emulated.  But as I
<br>
said, if it is Sj, then that's no different than benign teleportation.
<br>
<p>So am I right in thinking that your next question is either irrelevant
<br>
or not properly specified?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if your friend tells you which is the right file but you're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely sure you believe him? What if you implement a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computations using all the files, knowing that one of them has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right one?
