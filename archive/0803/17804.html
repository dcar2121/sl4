<em>&gt;&gt;  I do not believe that pi (or more precisely an entirely random sequence)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is more conscious, and has more conscious observers, than the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  human race on Earth in the year 2008.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  But to your way of thinking, must not an infinitely long random sequence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  similar to pi in many ways, contain stretches isomorphic to anyone's life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  isomorphic to all the thoughts humans have ever had or ever can have?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, pi would contain only an infinitesimal proportion [!] of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computations underpinning any given physical reality, since there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinitely many transcendental numbers, as well as all the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical structures.
</em><br>
<p>But pi contains *every* finite sequence of digits, sooner or later in
<br>
its expansion.  I wasn't talking about proportions. Pi (given that it is
<br>
random and never does exhibit patterns, and is like a truly random string)
<br>
also contains every infinite sequence too, allowing for gaps, e.g. infinite
<br>
sequences using blocks a trillion digits long. Therefore by your lights
<br>
when you said
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;&gt; The decimal expansion of pi looks random but contains any string of
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt; digits you care to nominate, if you calculate it to enough places
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt; [actually I don't think this has been proven, but it is conjectured to
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt; be so]. That is, the ensemble looks random, but it contains islands of
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt; structure hidden in the noise. If these islands of structure contain
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt; observers, they will be no less conscious for the fact that an
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;&gt; observer outside the ensemble can't find them.
</em><br>
<p>mustn't you say that pi contains all the thoughts of all Earth people in 2008?
<br>
(Where we differ is that to me, pi is a frozen string. There is no information
<br>
flow, hence no consciousness.)  Clifford Pickover (in the link you provided)
<br>
<a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/pimatrix.html">http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/pimatrix.html</a>  and his readers don't
<br>
understand the difference between a frozen state and live computation.
<br>
<p>So while the dust between the galaxies (out to say 10^200 light years)
<br>
in a finite though large universe, rather explicitly exhibits every state of 
<br>
of any person. But that person gets no runtime from it, since there is
<br>
no information flow between the states.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Even if [Monday and Tuesday] occurred in separate Hubble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; volumes with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; chance of information flow between them you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; experience Monday followed by Tuesday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes, but only if (to my way of thinking) there was any information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  flow going on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if two computers implement Monday and Tuesday in isolation from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other, i.e. purely by chance, there *won't* be subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity between them, while if two similar computers implement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monday and Tuesday in a similar way, except the programmer set up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tuesday having knowledge of Monday, there *will* be subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity between them? How is this discrepancy possible, if mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states supervene on physical states?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, all of Monday will be filled with bonafide conscious experience
<br>
of all entities lucky enough to be emulated, and so will Tuesday,
<br>
But there will be no causal information flow between them, so for
<br>
one instant between Monday 24:59:59.999... and Tuesday 12:00.00
<br>
information flow will not exist. But the internal observers, of course,
<br>
will lose almost nothing. This is not the case with dust between the
<br>
stars, since no causal information flow connects any two instants. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  That's the main reason that I don't subscribe to &quot;platonic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  computation. That is, real computation---any computation worthy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  of the name---must be driven by causality in which each state is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  causally derived from earlier state(s).  I don't believe in timeless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  computation, calculation, or consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have to explain how the computations know they are causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected, and not just accidentally connected.
</em><br>
<p>To me, it's not a matter of them knowing it.  In your example,
<br>
Monday and Tuesday (separately, it is true) exhibit total and
<br>
continuous causal information flow (except for one tiny instant
<br>
half way through the 48 hours).  But then, each day is fully
<br>
implemented in a computer operating under ordinary information
<br>
flow.
<br>
<p>Consciousness just is, causal information flow just is. And it is they,
<br>
I claim, which are required, contrary to the Theory of Dust.
<br>
Otherwise &quot;absurdities&quot; follow, such as that almost every random
<br>
decimal expansion between 0 and 1 implements more consciousness
<br>
than all the people together who ever lived.
