</em><br>
<p><p>Yes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Everyone has a different

</em><br>
<p><p>Agreed, although the same could be said of anything that is not formalized
<br>
in an internally consistent system.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Utlimately, the ideas that

</em><br>
<p><p>Perhaps. But it may be helpful at this point to delineate what specifically
<br>
we are talking about here.
<br>
Lets propose that the term 'consciousness', as we are using it here, is
<br>
synonymous with 'self awareness'. There are possible differences, but lets
<br>
treat it as analogous for the time being. To me, 'self awareness' is a kind
<br>
of recursive incorporation of a formal, rational system into itself. I'm not
<br>
sure if it is completely self-incorporated to the point of it being almost
<br>
holographic (exact self-similarity), with the whole contained in each
<br>
instantiation of its parts, or only partially so (quasi self-similarity).
<br>
This may have evolved, so to speak, as a consistency-checking mechanism.
<br>
<p>Of course it is impossible to formalize the 'experience' of consciousness,
<br>
but it may make sense to talk about its likely effects and architecture.  To
<br>
me there seems to be an isomorphism between the experience of self-awareness
<br>
and certain aspects of recursive logic.
<br>
<p>Rgds,
<br>
<p>Ross
