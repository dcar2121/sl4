<em>&gt;  Oh, okay.  But you don't defend &quot;close duplicates should merge

</em><br>
<p>I don't defend it.  I don't deny that I said it either.  I meant that
<br>
by whatever mechanism that a duplicate is created, there should be as
<br>
simple or complex a machine to reverse the process.  If by teleporter,
<br>
then I would note that in the Star Trek universe there were a few
<br>
occasions where individuals were recovered from the pattern buffer at
<br>
the expense of new experience in their alternate awareness substrate.
<br>
Perhaps that is a nod to the difficulty the machinery would have in
<br>
managing anything beyond a 1:1 mapping over some distance within a
<br>
sufficiently small time.  To jump to another fictional universe
<br>
employing transporter technology, I suggest a Stargate Atlantis
<br>
example:  an alien race known as Wraith feed on human Life Force (so
<br>
capitalized because I want to treat it as a named property which I
<br>
can't explain)  Their race can only grow in number if there are
<br>
sufficient numbers of humans to consume, and it's a moderately
<br>
successful plot device.  I always wondered why this would be a problem
<br>
for aliens that can teleport a human via upload-&gt;storage, then
<br>
reconstitute the person from storage back to flesh&amp;blood.  It would
<br>
seem an easy solution to produce any number of copies from storage
<br>
using whatever fantastical power source drives the ship as the input
<br>
energy for the reconstitution.  I know this is completely divergent...
<br>
sorry.
<br>
<p>Given further consideration of my statement you have quoted above, I
<br>
would like to put a strike-through over it.  Or white-out, or whatever
<br>
the Web2.0 mechanism for a retraction might be.  (hmm... Does such a
<br>
thing as retraction even exist in the always-instantly-everywhere
<br>
world?)
