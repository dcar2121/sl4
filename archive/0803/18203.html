<em>&gt;&gt; But it is *so* important to know whether your husband has been

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So I will continue to insist that the goal of uploading is to emulate

<em>&gt;&gt; a human consciousness, not simulate it, and we need some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of terminological distinction for this, if not the one I've been pushing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You just modify the neurons that makes you falsely believe that there is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinction to make you also believe that the upload is successful.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From your brief reply, I gather that you do not believe in such a
</em><br>
distinction?
<br>
<p>So there is no essential difference between, say, your wife and her
<br>
abrupt replacement by an extremely skilled actress fashioned to
<br>
look just like her, but who is really laughing at you all the time, and 
<br>
despises all the values your wife used to hold before her demise?
<br>
<p>I cannot believe that you'd endorse this simulation replacing your wife,
<br>
not if you truly love her.
<br>
<p>Now what about if she dies suddenly in her sleep, but a very kindly
<br>
and well-meaning AI plants a tiny microchip in her backbone that
<br>
manages to send out signals to all parts of her body that cause
<br>
exactly the same thinking and acting to be done be done by the body?
<br>
In other words, this microchip, over which the AI has no further use
<br>
and no further interest in, *emulates* your wife. That is, this new 
<br>
creature is conscious in just the same way as your wife was, has
<br>
inner thoughts and suspicions in the same way, has the same tastes
<br>
and loves and hates and, in general values.
<br>
<p>Surely this emulation &quot;really is&quot; your wife---it's just that she's been
<br>
uploaded. That's best for her, surely you concede, than being
<br>
replaced by a fiendish actor who is really a different person 
<br>
altogether.
