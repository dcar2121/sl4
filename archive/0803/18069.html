<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the first place, and not just to survival, but why are they so important, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; period.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What in the world does that mean?  How can something be important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in the abstract without being important to someone, or for something?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, then why are memories important [to people] in the first place?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The explanation I'm looking for cannot:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) assume memories are important [to people]
</em><br>
<p>I'll take that as a joke  :-)   though it's quite possible that you have
<br>
correctly criticized some of us for circular reasoning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) mention concept of &quot;survival&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can you do that?
</em><br>
<p>I think so. Suppose that people are different from each other
<br>
because of specific characteristics, brain structures, and so
<br>
on (and not because their soul has a different #ID-num).
<br>
Suppose further that in general people don't want to become
<br>
much more like someone else than like themselves;  specifically,
<br>
person X does not want to lose what makes him X and thus
<br>
become, say, his friend Max (person Y).  Finally, it's a
<br>
commonplace observation that people often resist change
<br>
anyway.
<br>
<p>Given those two assumptions and one observation, we
<br>
can conclude that my becoming a lot more like you means
<br>
to some degree that Lee Corbin is---just a little bit or quite
<br>
a bit---morphing into someone else, namely Slawek, say.
<br>
<p>Time for a pithy example.  Suppose that your best friend
<br>
rather suddenly acquired all of my memories (due to some
<br>
fiendish test for world domination that I'm trying out).
<br>
You do start noticing startling and sudden personality
<br>
changes.  Finally he says &quot;I'm really your pen-pal Lee
<br>
Corbin!&quot;.  You'd be aghast and you'd say: &quot;prove it!&quot;.
<br>
&quot;Well, &quot; says he, &quot;do you remember how in an email
<br>
not so long ago I got you to tell me that you lived in
<br>
New Jersey by correctly guessing your age (to within
<br>
five years)?&quot;  And he goes on and on relating things that
<br>
presumably only Lee Corbin would know (unless your
<br>
friend is part of some incredible conspiracy and has
<br>
acquired uncanny acting skills).
<br>
<p>(You would probably retort &quot;Oh Fred, or whatever
<br>
his name is, &quot;you're not really Lee at all!  You just
<br>
have his memories!&quot;.  To me that's a pretty weak
<br>
response, most obviously because 99 out of 100
<br>
people knowing the facts would *say* that &quot;that
<br>
diabolical Lee Corbin has taken over your friend,
<br>
and your friend is apparently gone&quot;. But that's just
<br>
an illustration. I understand that to you he's still Fred.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, back to the logic.  Since X does not want to
<br>
become more like Y than X, especially perhaps in terms
<br>
of behavioral characteristics at least, say, (we can find
<br>
other characteristics to add), then X surely does not
<br>
want X's body to suddenly have Y's memories. People
<br>
hate amnesia, and regard it as an inconvenience, to say
<br>
the very least (you can surely agree with that). 
<br>
<p>Again, your question was
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok, then why are memories important [to people] in the first place?
</em><br>
<p>and I think I've answered pretty well. So now I get to ask
<br>
two questions:  would you mind losing most of your memories?
<br>
If you got all of Lee Corbin's memories and retained none of
<br>
Slawek's then would you (on your idea of what you &quot;is&quot;) 
<br>
behave more like Lee or more like Slawek?  Specifically,
<br>
what if I credibly offer to pay you $100,000,000 to let
<br>
your memories be entirely replaced by mine. Would you
<br>
take the deal?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; No, I'm equally unattached to &quot;my atoms&quot; (whatever that means) as I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unattached to my personal memories (hopefully, you'll see this).
</em><br>
<p>All I can say is &quot;wow!&quot;.  Hmm.  Would you settle, say, for $25,000
<br>
in *cash*?  I could use the New Jersey runtime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There *are* other things I can be attached to, you know.
</em><br>
<p>Like what?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm only in the process of trying to make you see what it is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please don't guess.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Back to the main question about importance of memories [to people]. See if this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dilemma clarifies anything. If you had to choose between 2 options, which one would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you prefer?
</em><br>
<p>Ah, a man after my own heart. Decisions and actions reveal better
<br>
than anything what we believe!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Option 1) In 1 minute you will go into an eternal coma. On the bright side, you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed that your brain, and thus your memories, will remain exactly the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are now until the end of Universe.
</em><br>
<p>Arghh!  No runtime :-(   No processing.  No more happy moments for Lee :-(
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Option 2) In 1 minute all your personal memories will be completely erased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from your brain, but, other than that, this brain will function just like any other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; healthy brain that's able to form and retain new personal memories and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember all the general knowledge acquired throughout the brain's life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like being able to speak, read and write English, do math, etc. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this brain will not remember its name, its opinions, its family and friends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its tastes, where it's located, none of that personal stuff.
</em><br>
<p>Option 2 is only slightly preferable because I'm still a bit of an idealist,
<br>
and think that it's better for some mystery person (whoever he is) to
<br>
exist than not exist.  But alas, for me, selfishly?  To me, I'm dead as
<br>
a doornail either way.
<br>
<p>Lee
