</em><br>
<p>I'm pretty sure there is only one approach here.  Here is my understanding:
<br>
<p>The entropy of a black hole is based on calculating the rate of pair
<br>
production to see how much Hawking radiation comes out, which turns
<br>
out to be exactly what you'd expect of a blackbody radiating at a
<br>
particular temperature T.  If you use standard thermodynamics to turn
<br>
that temperature into an entropy S, then voila, you get S = A/4 for
<br>
the entropy of a black hole.  The Bekenstein bound is based on the
<br>
argument that the most stuff you can fit into a region of space is a
<br>
black hole... and on various thought experiments, which indicate that
<br>
if you tried to put *more* stuff in, you would just get a bigger black
<br>
hole.  You don't calculate anything independently, you just quote the
<br>
result from black holes, and say that for anything else, S &lt; A/4.   So
<br>
yes, there is some thermodynamics involved, but it's involved at the
<br>
stage of calculating the black hole entropy... which you need to do
<br>
first in order to find the Bekenstein bound.  There aren't two
<br>
different approaches, because one result requires the other result to
<br>
be computed first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  That is not the same thing.  My question is how do you derive the mass of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  proton from c, h, and G if it is not a coincidence?  Why do you need the age
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the universe?
</em><br>
<p>You *cannot* derive it from those, as it depends on completely
<br>
different physical constants from those (such as the fine structure
<br>
constant, lots of electroweak parameters, the QCD scale, etc.).  If
<br>
you are putting in those numbers and getting something close to the
<br>
proton mass, then it is purely coincidence... you haven't done
<br>
anything meaningful, you've just put a bunch of random numbers
<br>
together.  It seems to me that no matter what you got when you divided
<br>
V by S, you would have claimed it was an interesting coincidence.  I
<br>
mean, if you had gotten the size of an atom, you would say &quot;oh wow, 1
<br>
bit per atom&quot;... if you had gotten the size of the solar system, you
<br>
would have said &quot;wow, 1 bit per solar system!&quot;  But bits per volume
<br>
means nothing.  There is nothing significant about that quotient
<br>
coming out near the proton mass.  There are plenty of other masses of
<br>
particles that it could have come out near.
