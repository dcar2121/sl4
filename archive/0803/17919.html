</em><br>
<p>I don't think anything in this thread is all that paradoxical.  As
<br>
many have pointed out, it's clear what will happen physically, and
<br>
what fraction of your copies will be tortured (or see heads).  So the
<br>
only issue is regarding this word &quot;anticipation&quot;.  My opinion is not
<br>
that we should give up on anticipation, but that we should just choose
<br>
the most useful thing to do in the situation.  The point of
<br>
anticipating an event is to set your brain up in a state so that it is
<br>
prepared to deal with that event if and when it happens with the
<br>
appropriate proabability.  And I think it's clear that there is only
<br>
one objective &quot;right answer&quot; to what you should anticipate.  You
<br>
should anticipate in the case of the coins, that there is a 100:1
<br>
chance that a future instance of your brain will have to deal with the
<br>
coin being heads, and in the case of the torture it's the same story.
<br>
So clearly the most adaptively useful thing to do is to put your brain
<br>
into a state where you expect to see heads with 100:1 odds.
<br>
<p>As for merging, I don't understand what is meant.  It doesn't seem
<br>
like a very coherent idea.  The whole idea of a &quot;person&quot; is that you
<br>
have some sequence of memories.  If you tried to merge people with two
<br>
different sets of memories, what would that mean?  It couldn't result
<br>
in a another person, because people have sequential memories (you
<br>
can't remember two different things happening).  It might be possible
<br>
to construct some more general type of sentience that &quot;remembers&quot;
<br>
mutliple branches but I have no idea how that would work or if it
<br>
would be possible... but clearly this thing you created would be very
<br>
different than a human, and it may or may not be appropriate to even
<br>
call it a type of consciousness.  But even if it were possible, how it
<br>
would work would probably depend a lot on the implementation, and it
<br>
would probably require new ways of speaking about identity (if
<br>
identity even makes sense for such a creature).  But it doesn't seem
<br>
that relevant to the main question here, which is what should you
<br>
anticipate when you are being copied... a question whose answer seems
<br>
pretty clear.
