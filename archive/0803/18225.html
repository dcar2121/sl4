<em>&gt; 1). Your email's subject line is obviously misleading. The primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concern is how to make Friendly AIs, not Friendly humans.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, come on  . . . . given that *no one* has an AI nor expects to have one this year, you have absolutely no excuse for being mislead by the title.  The *only* intelligent machine that I possibly could have implemented Friendliness on is a human being.  This is an intelligent first step to implementing it on a future AI.  
<br>
<p>How am I not addressing the/*your* primary concern?  
<br>
<p>How is the subject line misleading -- given that it is already longer than the visible field of my webmail page?  
<br>
<p>Me thinks thou doth protest far too much.  Why does this bother you so much?  Are you afraid of being infected with a meme that enforces ethics?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2). Please provide some evidence to the list that you haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committed any immoral acts since declaring Friendliness, which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather audacious claim.
</em><br>
<p>First, I have never made any claims about morals.  I do not agree with most proclamations that most people make when they start using the word morals.  The term is *ethics* -- many people might believe that they are synonymous but they have radically different connotations for many others.
<br>
<p>Second, about the only proof that I can provide is to declare that I have not *knowingly* performed any unethical acts since being fully infected and challenge everyone to prove any evidence to the contrary.  The problem with this &quot;proof&quot; is that I'd also say that I'm not sure that you could provide any evidence of me knowingly performing unethical acts in the last several *YEARS* -- so Friendliness hasn't visibly changed my personal *willingness* to act ethically AT ALL.  I was previously willing to act ethically and pretty much always did so (to the extent that I can't remember not doing so in the past several years) and I remain that way.
<br>
<p>Third, I can't think of any other evidence I could provide.  Do you have any suggestions to help me?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3). The fragility of this type of cooperative Friendliness has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long since established in evolutionary biology. 
</em><br>
<p>What cooperative Friendliness?  I'm not seeing any cooperation here at all.  I asked for assistance.  I said &quot;If you believe that this is incorrect, *PLEASE* free me by showing me where this meme is harmful and rid me of my infection.&quot;  You came back and attacked me for being misleading and then demanded proof that I was a good person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vulnerable to anyone who wants to disrupt it. Mitigating this requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a huge technological or power advantage, which we don't currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.
</em><br>
<p>Prove your statement by freeing me of the meme or making me willingly perform an unethical act.
<br>
