<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; I looked it up. The physics of the machine is such that state A will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; reliably transition to state B. This can either be worked out from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; first principles or by experiment, and the results stored in a table.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  But if the result of this calculation is merely stored in a table,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and subsequent &quot;calculations&quot; just access and exhibit this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  result, then no genuine computation is performed the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and later times.  Only the first calculation was authentic, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  also authentic in the sense that I believe consciousness during
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  any particular run to depend on this authenticity of computation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The physics of the machine is just there to determine that the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state transitions consistently occur. A model of an AND gate does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to involve a simulation of semiconductor physics; the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose of the physics is to ensure that the state transitions in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple lookup table are followed.
</em><br>
<p>And who says that there's never any progress in email discussions?
<br>
It sounds as though you have finished asking about my requirements
<br>
for a computation to be conscious.  If not, pray continue.
<br>
<p>Then we disagree, as follows. Your last paragraph conveys, though
<br>
naturally too briefly, one standard way of saying what a computation is.
<br>
That your views lead directly to beliefs I consider faintly absurd does
<br>
not bother you at all, since you endorse the final results of my
<br>
reduction anyway. Namely, a succession of frozen states, or patches
<br>
of dust between the galaxies, or even a rock---all of these do just as
<br>
good as does your own brain.  True, if your brain is demolished in an
<br>
accident tomorrow, that infinitesimally reduces the amount of runtime,
<br>
but at least you gain the consolation that the very same atoms, buried
<br>
in a cemetery somewhere in Australia, still continue to implement you,
<br>
just as does every object or collection of atoms (no matter how dispersed),
<br>
all according to the patterns of Platonia.
<br>
<p>Thanks so very much, if we're done.  Else continue.
<br>
<p>Time for me to start asking (I guess with my provocative last paragraph
<br>
I already have), or time to move on to Repeated Experience?
<br>
