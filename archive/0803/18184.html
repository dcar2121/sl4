Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     hey, Slawek, how come you don't put attributions at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;                        appropriate places in your posts---at least lately?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Because I realized you don't do that. I was trying to make you more comfortable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; adopting your style of posting.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes I do.  At the top of every post I say who said something. Later
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, when I think it's &quot;obvious&quot; I drop it.  But mistakes can be made  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See how it says &quot;Heartland writes&quot; up there?  I don't think that you'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even find one post I wrote on this list where I don't do that---even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I do issue a preamble of sorts first.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you do that, but once you scroll down it's sometimes hard to figure out who 
<br>
said
<br>
what, which is why I prefer attributing each group of paragraphs and make 
<br>
everything visually clean for crystal
<br>
clarity. I think I'm the only one who bothers to do that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You still haven't answered the main question (the one I keep asking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; beginning of my posts). You can always ask anything you want but please
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; know that we won't go very far until you're able to answer the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; question or realize the answer doesn't exist.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Sorry---what question is that?  Can you repeat it, please?  I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try again to answer it.
</em><br>
<p>It's the same question I've been asking since the beginning of our discussion. 
<br>
First, I asked you why
<br>
memories were important to you. You answered it was because you wanted to remain 
<br>
like Lee Corbin. Then I asked why being &quot;like something&quot; was important, and you 
<br>
replied that people don't want to be like rodents, for example. Since I'm not much 
<br>
closer to getting the answer, I'm asking it again below.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; So can you please explain what point you were making when you said people don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; want to be like rodents?
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; People don't want to be as small as rodents, or have as short a lifespan, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have as little intelligence, or be so ugly (in human bias). There are also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surely many other features of rodents in general that people in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not want.
</em><br>
<p>Wait. You're making the exact same point as before, namely, that people don't want
<br>
to be like rodents because rodents experience lower quality of life (small size, 
<br>
shorter
<br>
lifespan, decreased intelligence, ugliness). I thought we agreed that a
<br>
potential change in quality of life could not have influenced your desire to not
<br>
become like a rodent. If you imply something other than lower quality of life, what 
<br>
is it?
<br>
<p>Regarding the other paragraph I snipped (see, I'm doing my share :-)), I'm well 
<br>
aware that people don't want to be drastically different than they already are, and 
<br>
know what they mean when they say, &quot;I want to be like Brad Pitt,&quot; but I still have 
<br>
not received an explanation for *why* it's so important to you not to be like 
<br>
someone/something else. Do you think this explanation exists?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It's crucial that we identify what it is, exactly, as it's the same thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that causes you to say, &quot;I want to remain like Lee Corbin.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; We are not yet sure that it is the *same* thing.  I may have other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons for wanting to remain Lee Corbin besides acquiring the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristics of rodents.
</em><br>
<p>What are they?
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; ...is [it] that under anaesthesia, perhaps you believe your &quot;instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; of mind process&quot; is ended?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It's an objective fact. Even all cryonicists should have no problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; acknowledging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this simple truth. An instance of any type of process ends when it stops. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; catch a ball, its flight ends. What can be less confusing than that?
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Just checking. Just confirming that you believe that what you value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really would be lost if you take anaesthesia.  Right?  I mean, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would refuse general anaesthesia if you went to a hospital and the doctors were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to perform an exceedingly, exceedingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painful operation?
</em><br>
<p>It's complicated. My final decision would have to take into account potential size
<br>
of area under the &quot;pain over time&quot; curve on a xy-plane--where x-axis denotes time
<br>
and y-axis measures intensity of pain--for both cases. In the end, it's all about
<br>
quality of life for me, so, if the size of area under &quot;pain over time&quot; curve 
<br>
reached
<br>
a certain limit (not sure what it is right now, I don't think it's very high) in 
<br>
any case, I
<br>
would accept general anesthesia as surviving with this limit exceeded would make no
<br>
sense either. IOW, the quality of life would reach unacceptably low levels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I will always try to find something that will hopefully invalidate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this view, but, so far, I've been unsuccessful in my search.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; What's worse is that, the more I think about it, the final
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; conclusion seems more obvious in retrospect.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Well, that can happen even if one is dead wrong.
</em><br>
<p>I suspect it's at least less likely to happen than seeing something as more obvious 
<br>
in retrospect and be right about it.
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Would you like for someone you love to go under anesthesia?
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't have liked it even if I had believed in new-age-inspired theories such
<br>
as that &quot;people are adjectives,&quot; to quote my inebriated persecutor. I wouldn't 
<br>
protest, though.
