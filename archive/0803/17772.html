</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How do you measure complexity?  How many bits are required for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A lot, but we don't know enough yet to put a lower bound on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We dont have a clue about consciousness in non-human entities (animals etc)
<br>
and where on the tree of life we want to draw a cut-off point, but we can be
<br>
conservative and set an upper lower bound. Since the human genome has approx
<br>
3x10^9 base pairs (of which each pair has 4 states), about 6x10^9 bits. or
<br>
6Gbits. While the human brain holds significantly more information than
<br>
6Gbits, it could be argued that the brain itself is a recursive fractal
<br>
generated by some subset of the 6Gbit base pair 'program' we have in our
<br>
DNA.
<br>
<p>but the bigger question by far is how much contextual information that base
<br>
program requires to execute. If you have a stretch of DNA and lay it out on
<br>
a table, its going to decay and blow away. so you need some sort of
<br>
environmental, cellular 'context' with which to generate a program that can
<br>
utilize that DNA. The program itself may be recursive, generated largely
<br>
from the DNA itself, which likely has a blueprint for various cell types,
<br>
but we dont know if its possible to create a slightly different cellular
<br>
environment that this DNA could be housed in, and end up with a completely
<br>
different type of organism. In addition, its difficult to tell precisely how
<br>
much information is contained in a cellular program. Do self-assembling
<br>
structures inside cells require 'information' to self assemble, so to speak?
<br>
or are the laws of physics contextually assumed?  Even if they are, if we
<br>
are simulating consciousness on a computer, we are relying on a subset of
<br>
the laws of physics that are present in a cellular environment with which to
<br>
run our computer program.
<br>
<p>Its not necessarily a clear-cut answer, as you know,
<br>
<p>Ross
