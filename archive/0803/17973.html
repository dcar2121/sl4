</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  reply to every possible question that you may put to it. In effect,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  The lookup is merely indexical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you mention afterwards, this is a &quot;super extreme thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment&quot; since it's not only practically impossible, but also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physically impossible even in principle.
</em><br>
<p>*Unless* it turns out that computronium is even more capable of
<br>
performing calculations in a small space and at a greater rate than
<br>
we have imagined. It's also important to see---as I think you have
<br>
---that if I walk into a room with a GLUT-driven human shaped
<br>
robot, then because of the speed of light limitations, its physical
<br>
volume cannot be very big. No Jupiter Brain here. Yet it acts
<br>
perfectly as well under any test as would a real human being.
<br>
<p>But the point is that on ****very**** theoretical grounds, 
<br>
functionalism is be false. Who knows? Such computronium
<br>
might be possible.
<br>
<p>So I agree perfectly with the remainder of your comments, and
<br>
could not have written them as well as you did.  Thanks!

<p><em>&gt;  Let's say you want to ask it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any question that can be fit into a 100 byte string.  (I could imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asking questions which take more than a line to type out, but let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make the conservative assumption that every possible question fits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a 1-line short string like this.)  That means there are 2^800
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different possible questions you could ask it (let's ignore the issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of whether all of the possible strings you could make correspond to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful questions... if only 1 in a million correspond to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaningful question, then add a few more bytes to the length of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowed string to get up to the full 2^800 possibilities).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since there are 2^800 possible questions, it needs a lookup table that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is at least 2^800 bits long.  This is assuming every question has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes/no answer.  If they require freeform response, then you'd need an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even larger lookup table... something like 800^800 = 2^7715 bits if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the answers can be 100 bytes just like the questions.  However, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total number of quantum bits in the entire universe is only 10^120 =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2^400 (from the Bekenstein bound).  This is the maximal amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information which can be stored in the entire universe.  2^7715 simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't fit!  Even if you believe the universe extends forever past the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cosmological horizon, it still doesn't help because there is an event
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horizon about 16 billion light years away beyond which nothing will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever be able to affect us so it cannot be used for computing.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're stuck always with this 10^120 bit limitation... no global lookup
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tables are allowed, even if you are only interested in yes/no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions limitted to 100 bytes in length.
