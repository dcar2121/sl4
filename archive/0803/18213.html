<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Aliens might consider the whole galaxy as close to a homogeneous

<em>&gt;  &gt; to a scientist or a pedant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do they have scientists?  Do their instruments reach all the way down
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to the tiny size of stars? (No sarcasm; they may be gigantic beings.)
</em><br>
<p>They have scientists, they have instruments, but their brains are not
<br>
like yours and mine. They think of a planet orbiting a star as
<br>
time-dependent fluctuations in the local density of a solar system
<br>
which they see as basically homogeneous. Their model predicts
<br>
everything that our model does, but the aliens are unable to see it
<br>
intuitively in the way we do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; How would you explain to these aliens that they've got it wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Where is their empirical or logical error.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Their empirical error is an apparent inability to detect drastic changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in density over stellar scales. For all I know, we might be making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  same &quot;empirical error&quot; about quarks.
</em><br>
<p>Their scientists may be able to give you density readings over a large
<br>
volume of space, but still not be able to see why humans make sharp
<br>
distinctions between the star and the surrounding space. I am not
<br>
suggesting that it is likely such an alien species would evolve, but
<br>
it is possible. And they would not be making any empirical or logical
<br>
error: their model may predict the clumpiness of various parts of
<br>
space, describe what happens in stellar evolution etc. as well as we
<br>
can - but with an alien understanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; I don't want to die, and because I don't want to die, I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; do anything that will make me suicidal, such as modifying my own mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; or allowing someone else to do it. I know beyond any doubt that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; desire to live (which incorporates beliefs about personal identity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; what counts as survival) is just something that evolution has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; programmed into me, and that there is no objective basis to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a bit surprised that you, as a nominalist, even find the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;objective basis&quot; useful.
</em><br>
<p>Objective is all that which isn't subjective. If we agree on how to
<br>
define a star we can measure its diameter. But there is no objective
<br>
basis for saying that a star must be defined a particular way, despite
<br>
what seems natural to us.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But I believe selves to essentially be as real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as stars, or as real as democracy.  All of these can be deconstructed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of course, as you and some others here have shown. One can even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  take split-brain patients, and so on. Their case is especially interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  because they'll dissemble for the sake of the unity of their selves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  But when it comes down to it, it is just sophomoric to deny that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  are the same person from moment to moment.
</em><br>
<p>I accept that it would be unlikely that an evolved species would
<br>
define &quot;person&quot; in that way, but there is no reason why they could not
<br>
do so and still consistently describe reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; If a person claims that 2+2=5 he is wrong, and if a person claims that lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; is denser than gold he is wrong; but if a person declares that he no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; longer wishes to live he is *not* wrong, but simply stating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; predilection which happens to be contrary to the usual evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; programming.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, exactly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; But understanding all this as I do, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which &quot;I&quot; ?
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;I&quot; that seems to persist from moment to moment. Unless stated
<br>
otherwise, I use the term in the way everyone else does.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; *still* would resist anything that would make me suicidal. Moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; I don't in the slightest regret the fact that I am trapped in this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; This is what I mean by &quot;willing slave&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that particular &quot;slave&quot; you refer to is just as illusory to your way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of thinking as your self is, isn't it?
</em><br>
<p>Once a term is defined and understood, it isn't illusory. The illusion
<br>
is the feeling that the definition must be somehow on a par with
<br>
physical facts: that the demarcation between star and not-star is
<br>
right or wrong in the same way as the value of the density in a
<br>
particular volume of space is right or wrong.
