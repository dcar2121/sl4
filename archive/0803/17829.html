<p>If you're an altruist in a world with 6 billion people to drown out your
<br>
individual hedonism, then we can say that to calculate the EU of some
<br>
action, you add half the utility of having one copy of you take that
<br>
action to half the utility of having 100 copies of you take that action.
<br>
Subjective anticipation is really just one of the steps involved in
<br>
making decisions, so once you know what the decision is, who cares what
<br>
you anticipate?
<br>
<p>If we make not just 100 copies of you, but 100 copies of everything you
<br>
care about, then I'm less sure how to answer this. It would sure make
<br>
things easy if we could say that 100 copies of everything is precisely
<br>
100 times as good as 1 copy of everything.
<br>
<p>This would, however, imply that it's better to have 2 non-interacting
<br>
copies of a world with utility 10 than to have 2 distinct
<br>
non-interacting worlds with utility 10 and 9. I think this probably
<br>
wouldn't make the AI tile the universe with small optimal objects,
<br>
because the possible utility of an object could increase more than
<br>
linearly with size.
<br>
<p>This would also contradict my previously-stated opinion that utility
<br>
functions should be bounded.
