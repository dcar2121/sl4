</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  will seem crazy to believe that another copy isn't you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soon after merging of two similar entities becomes possible, merging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dissimilar entities will become possible.
</em><br>
<p>Egads!  Well, yes, it would become *possible*, but the resulting
<br>
creature... gee, it wouldn't be either of the two people who chose
<br>
such a drastic (and very problematic) merger. Quite another thing
<br>
altogether!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It may then seem crazy to deny that We Are All One.
</em><br>
<p>As long as I just have the Lee Corbin memories, I certainly am
<br>
*not* the GroupMind/AllInOne thingy.  I will continue to deny
<br>
that &quot;We Are All One&quot; until my dying day, literally.

<em>&gt;&gt;  Naturally, I oppose the construction &quot;if you are the one that dies&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  because I consider you to be both of them. As you know, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  think that it's possible to be in two places at the same time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  just as it's possible to be at two times in the same place. (We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  simply need to get used to the idea.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a bit confused, because it seems you are saying that it matters if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your copy near Sirius dies but it doesn't matter if one of your copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dies as during destructive teleportation (by which I meant what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described except that the original disintegrates during the scan).
</em><br>
<p>Oh, it is *very* regrettable that one of my instances (in the originating
<br>
teleportation booth) must perish. I'd far rather have two instances
<br>
going than one. So it *does* matter that it dies. It just doesn't matter
<br>
much which one (except that in the case of teleportation, of course,
<br>
the whole point is to start being at one place even at the cost of no
<br>
longer being at another place.
