<p>As you've known full well for years, I never said that unique atoms were 
<br>
instrumental in giving
<br>
us individuality. Even other people told you many times this wasn't what I had 
<br>
said. Do you think if you repeat this often enough, people will believe it?
<br>
<p>In fact, I think it is you who've said many times before that unique atoms are 
<br>
crucial to your survival, right? Can you explain that? I disagree. ;-)

<p>Well, then I'm certainly under no obligation to explain my views to you. Feel free

to not be obligated to respond to anything I write. Thanks.
