<p><em>&gt; No one would be your own closer duplicate than your closest multiverse cousin.
</em><br>
<p>We agree.  That for sure is the very common usage.  Especially here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose you could merge with him.
</em><br>
<p>Quite pointless, since you and he are identical---unless you mean the tiniest possible
<br>
quantum difference. In that case, I agree.  Of course, we can't reach into that other
<br>
branch, so we'd have to have a copy of that other &quot;you&quot; here somehow, in order
<br>
to really begin the merge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That being done, your cousin's cousin would not be a far fetch from there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So on and so on.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but of course it gets harder and harder. And by the time you get
<br>
to &quot;another person&quot; (see preceding emails in this thread) it's very, very
<br>
problematical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until you reach maximum intellectual entropy ? The total collective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness of an intellectual state beginning at a given point in time? 
</em><br>
<p>I don't know what you mean by &quot;maximum intellectual entropy&quot; or
<br>
&quot;collective consciousness of an intellectual state&quot;.  Forgive a mild rant: 
<br>
<p>&lt;rant on&gt; Why on Earth do people think that they can just throw around
<br>
all sorts of weird phrases with no explanation on this list?  I've seen it a lot.
<br>
My own suspicion is that there is a hell of a lot of &quot;math envy&quot; on this list,
<br>
and if anyone wants to say
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Peter washed his hands&quot;,
<br>
<p>they'll rather say instead
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There is a t1 &lt; 0 such that the image of t1 under the natural
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mapping  t1 -&gt; Peter(t1) belongs to the set of dirty hands, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a t2,  t1&lt; t2 &lt;= 0 such that the image of t2 under that above-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioned mapping belongs to the complement of the set
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defined in the preceding sentence.&quot;  (Credit: V. I. Arnold)
<br>
<p>and that the more terse and mathematical the sentences, the more the writer
<br>
feels that he's showing everyone how smart he is, and (sad to say) the more
<br>
impressed feeble minds will be with him.
<br>
<p>&lt;rant off---for now&gt;
<br>
<p>And I don't mean to blame or single out CyTG.  I've seen much worse.
<br>
<p>Anyway, feeling better now, CyTG goes on
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until you reach maximum intellectual entropy ? The total collective consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an intellectual state beginning at a given point in time? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The concept just makes next to little sense to me
</em><br>
<p>That's two of us, pal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  .. I mean, to what end ? You'd have to have a fundamental, instinctive,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of at least the 4 dimensions and problary qm's to cope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with this sort of multi-awareness... and again, to what end ??
</em><br>
<p>Can you possibly restate your last questions?  I count three of them, one
<br>
with two question marks.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  And please go read about the evils of &quot;top posting&quot; and &quot;quoting the
<br>
entire  #?&amp;^%#*!!   text of someone's message.  Otherwise, I will taunt
<br>
you a second time.
