Stathis writes
<br>
<p>No written language will be based upon 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  But if they sent us one of their sacred stones, we would eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  find the non-random redundant pattern in the radioactive decay....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Great example. We would find the pattern because it is objectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  there, and its Komolgorov complexity is less than that of a random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  string.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I picked radioactive decay as an example of a truly random process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (you can predict the average number of decay events per unit time, but
</em><br>
<p>Oops.  Sorry, I did misunderstand. If they're using anything analogous to
<br>
a one-time pad, then of course.
<br>
<p>You had earlier written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But there is no reason why the written language of an alien species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; might not be, for example, based on the radioactive decay pattern of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sacred stone, in which case to us a message would look completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; random.
</em><br>
<p>In fact, it would *be* entirely random, which is what threw me off:
<br>
Why would anyone ever have a *language* based on total encipherment?
<br>
It makes no sense. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure that there *has* to be a pattern in the functioning of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer or whether it could instead be deliberately be designed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the equivalent of a cryptographer's one-time pad.
</em><br>
<p>I guess I can see that:  as you were saying, you could run some machine
<br>
at one set of randomly chosen galactic coordinates for one picosecond,
<br>
then run the next part of the computation light years away at another
<br>
randomly chosen location, and so on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose for the sake of argument that there does have to be a pattern,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which an intelligent being after long observation could in theory crack.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You could still increase the randomisation by breaking up a computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into parts, implementing the parts on computers with different (randomly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chosen) architecture, and shuffling them. The only discernible pattern might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then be within short runs of the one type of computer, and if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of the runs could be brought down to the length of one clock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cycle, we might be back to a situation where the one-time pad analogy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holds.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds plausible. Certainly someone would have to go through 
<br>
a lot of trouble for this, and I don't see why anyone or anything
<br>
would evolve to do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, having very short runs exponentially increases the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability that an isomorphic system will occur somewhere by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accident.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Was that the point?  Sorry, I've forgotten what the point here
<br>
was. 
<br>
<p>I've generally said that among the swirling dust clouds and random
<br>
particle motions of deep intergalactic space one could eventually
<br>
find a set of atoms isomorphic in structure to my brain at this instant.
<br>
That was sort of Hilary Putnam's point when he said that any rock
<br>
emulates anything.  But to me, it's pointless unless an emulation is
<br>
driven causally in real time in order to effect a computation.
<br>
<p>By the subject line, my claim was that any meaning found in a
<br>
communication (or artifact) if in order to truly be objective,
<br>
must exhibit isomorphism.  Some message that has meaning
<br>
which needs an exterior Rosetta stone or one-time pad to
<br>
decipher does not have objective meaning.  For, as you and
<br>
others have said, then anything can mean anything, with the
<br>
right key.
