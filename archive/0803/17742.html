<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; Why is whether something has experience or not even relevant?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Because all moral questions revolve around the answer! And so unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you are a complete nihilist, solipsist, or sociopath, all actions whatsoever
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that affect other sentients depend crucially upon the answer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No it doesn't.  Morality evolved (memetically) because it increases overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fitness of the tribe.  Thus, hunting, war, and judicial punishment are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permitted.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  And you do account nicely for its existence and properties
<br>
<p>What I was saying is that *your* own morality, e.g. the answers you would
<br>
provide to morally challenging questions, depends utterly on the experiences
<br>
you expect others to have.
<br>
<p>This is obvious.  For example, if you could prevent extreme pain from
<br>
afflicting one of two creatures of your acquaintance, and you are having
<br>
a hard time deciding, the question is immediately resolved were you
<br>
to learn the truth that one was a robot incapable of sensation.
<br>
<p>So, you see, whether something has experience or can be extremely relevant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no test to tell whether something has experiences or just expresses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; belief in experience.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But there will still be a fact of the matter, whether or not we are
<br>
able to learn it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, evolution favors animals that behave as if they believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience is real (e.g. actively avoiding pain). This might explain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why you find consciousness so mysterious.
</em><br>
<p>Consciousness is only mysterious to me in the same way that the sun's
<br>
corona is mysterious. (We don't yet know for sure why it's so hot.)
<br>
As yet, we don't have very good criteria for determining just how conscious
<br>
a system under examination is.
<br>
