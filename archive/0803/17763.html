</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes. Was that the point?  Sorry, I've forgotten what the point here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  was.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I was exploring the idea that a random system might still have
<br>
&quot;objective meaning&quot;. It will of course be meaningless to any external
<br>
observer, but it might be meaningful to its own *internal* observers.
<br>
This doesn't apply to messages - they don't have internal observers -
<br>
but it does apply to certain classes of computations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I've generally said that among the swirling dust clouds and random
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  particle motions of deep intergalactic space one could eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  find a set of atoms isomorphic in structure to my brain at this instant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  That was sort of Hilary Putnam's point when he said that any rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  emulates anything.  But to me, it's pointless unless an emulation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  driven causally in real time in order to effect a computation.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why you say that. A moment of consciousness implemented in
<br>
a dust cloud should be just as good as a moment of consciousness
<br>
implemented in your head. You might argue that the advantage of a head
<br>
is that it will continue producing subsequent moments of consciousness
<br>
while the dust cloud will not. However, that isn't so if anything can
<br>
be interpreted as a computation: the dust cloud will produce all of
<br>
your moments of consciousness in parallel; or if you object to that
<br>
sort of economy some other dust cloud vastly distant in time and space
<br>
will implement your next moment, and another one the moment after
<br>
that, and so on. This seems to me to be an inevitable consequence of
<br>
the multiple realisability criterion of functionalism. We can avoid it
<br>
if we say the brain contains special non-computable processes, but I
<br>
see no reason to do that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  By the subject line, my claim was that any meaning found in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  communication (or artifact) if in order to truly be objective,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  must exhibit isomorphism.  Some message that has meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  which needs an exterior Rosetta stone or one-time pad to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  decipher does not have objective meaning.  For, as you and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  others have said, then anything can mean anything, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  right key.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is trivial or wrong (which term you use doesn't really matter)
<br>
to say that anything can mean anything with the right key - *except*
<br>
in the case of conscious computations, which bootstrap themselves into
<br>
meaningfulness.
