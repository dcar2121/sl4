Please excuse the top posting, but I agree with all the points that
<br>
Mike appears to be making.
<br>
<p>As for all the questions near the end of the post, they're interesting,
<br>
but I don't see how any of the basic issues we're discussing hinges
<br>
on any of them.
<br>
<p>Please feel free to ask any again of them that are real (and not
<br>
rhetorical) questions, and which vitally address whether memory
<br>
merging is possible for close duplicats. It is reassuring :-) that
<br>
you find memory merging of close duplicates (our subject line)
<br>
even less problematical than I do. And you gave good examples
<br>
of it IMO.

I doubt that it will be so difficult.  Once you have uploaded the first set of memories, the second should cram in with a bit of 
<br>
cleverness.  After that, the 3-N are a matter of rinse &amp; repeat.  Sure it might take a redesign/upgrade of memory pointers - but you 
<br>
were already suggesting that by supposing the movie and bookstore were indeterminately ordered.  I have had superpositions of 
<br>
memories that have and have not (yet) happened.  I have commented on &quot;dreams&quot; that I had, then (sometimes months) later actually 
<br>
experienced what I dreamed.  Is this a defect of memory or point-in-time awareness?  What if I told someone about the dream when I 
<br>
woke up or wrote the details in a journal?  Can a second party (or journal) corroborate the premonition/deja-vu - or, like the 
<br>
observer examining Schroedinger's cat, do they become entangled with the perception of memory/pre-cognition?
<br>
&lt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Suppose I had experience military combat training in an altered state but do not consciously recall this training until a 
<br>
life-threatening situation presents itself.  Did I 'merge' this experience into myself just-in-time, or was it lying dormant in an 
<br>
unconscious memory?  How do I recall the knowledge used to answer game-show questions between the time they are asked and the time 
<br>
the contestant answers them?  Is there some retrieval of knowledge that I casually encountered at some arbitrary point in the past, 
<br>
or a pre-cognitive examination of the impending answer?  I don't (often) think about it.
