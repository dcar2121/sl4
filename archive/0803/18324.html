<em>&gt;  I don't quite understand, or perhaps it's merely that I don't agree.
</em><br>
<p>Your comment showed you didn't understand the point. However,
<br>
rereading the point, I realised the point was utterly wrong, which
<br>
kind of undermines my feelings of smug superiority :-) It seems
<br>
differentiation is not the example to invoque here.
<br>
<p>But the original idea can be adapted, as follows: let us define some
<br>
other functional on the set of polynomials, via a GLUT, with
<br>
maximalish Kolmogorov Complexity, subject to only one rule &quot;R&quot;: it
<br>
maps polynomials of the nth degree to polynomials of the (n-1)th
<br>
degree.
<br>
<p>We then hit the set S with the usual hash function f, and have a new
<br>
GLUT, called f(GLUT), of pretty much same complexity. The rule about
<br>
polynomials is mapped to an equivalent rule f(R) on f(S), equivalent
<br>
with an ordered partition of f(S). The complexity of f(R) depends on
<br>
the details of S (in the best case, the rule is vacuous, in the worst
<br>
case, it is as complicated a f(GLUT) itself). Generally, however, it
<br>
will have much higher KC than R.
<br>
<p>So, schematically, R is an approximation of GLUT, while f(R) is an
<br>
approximation of f(GLUT). However, generically, R will be much simpler
<br>
than GLUT, and much simpler than f(R) is vis-a-vis f(GLUT).
<br>
<p>That is the mathematical statement of the original idea; there are
<br>
equivalents when we replace the original GLUT with some object C that
<br>
has less Kolmogorov Complexity. If we call C consciousness, and R is
<br>
some simple, crude approximation of C, we can't expect that f(R) is a
<br>
SIMPLE approximation of f(C). Hence my point for distingushing between
<br>
hash-function-equivalent setups.
<br>
<p>And ultimately, maybe, between consciousness and an equivalent GLUT.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; ...Many thanks. However, the red herring is still, in my view, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distinction between a GLUT and a hash-equivalent GLUT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I probably don't understand that. You did just get through pointing out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a vital difference between the GLUT in polynomial form, and a GLUT
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in some hash function equivalent form. So what does the latter mean?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, me bad and incompetent: &quot;between a rule and a hash equivalent GLUT&quot;.
<br>
