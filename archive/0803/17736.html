<p><em>&gt; Here is where I think one point is important to make however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no communication is completely devoid of contextual cues. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your ACJXM TBBCP EHYSK QNLRZ may seem opaque
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without reading your translation, but that's because it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embedded in communication that utilized a marginally different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; code (english) to convey meaning, and the code (your code)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself conveyed message in a more meta-pragmatic way than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the email itself did. Rather than have internal meaning, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning you intended to convey was through the *existence*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the message itself-- namely, that specific codes can exist. 
</em><br>
<p>I think that I agree. &quot;No communication is completely devoid of
<br>
contextual clues.&quot;  I can't think of a counter-example.  If one
<br>
alien senses another's presence somewhere in the galaxy and
<br>
throws up a big detailed map of the galaxy with an arbitrary portion
<br>
clearly differentiated, then among evolved species struggling to
<br>
prevail, the meaning is pretty clear.  But still---as you suggest---
<br>
that map's main communication between the two depends on
<br>
their potential contest for the real estate (the context).  The
<br>
conventional part of the meaning (the isomorphism to the galaxy)
<br>
does not, however, depend on convention, but relies on isomorphism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we move to a code we do not all immediately have a grasp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of however, context is information since less is understood from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outset. I can infer a fairly large amount of information from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your code even without your translation.
</em><br>
<p>True. &quot;A few examples: it is produced by a person.... likely... speaks English... &quot;
<br>
yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its existence communicates some type of information regarding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opacity or transparency of specific codes of communication.  
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At any rate the distinction becomes less clear. But it would also make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense to talk about isomorphisms of context, in addition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isomorphisms of signal. 
</em><br>
<p>Example?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Lee
