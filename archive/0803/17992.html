<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;  Anyway, I claim it isn't even *imaginable* how two truly separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  people (on the usual meaning of words), e.g. William Shakespeare
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and Albert Einstein, could be merged, without, as you say, creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;massive psychological problems&quot;, or a completely confused brand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  new person.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh! A challenge! :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's take a year, to do it properly. Start with Einstein, and try and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add Shakespeare (a retired Shakespear back at Stradford-upon-Avon).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every night we have our little mind-manipulator-o-matic, and change a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little bit of Einstein's mind. To keep it simple, let's assume Al is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware we are doing this...
</em><br>
<p>Very good. With enormous effort, just of the kind you are outlining
<br>
(thanks), perhaps it could be managed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There will be contradictions here, but people can live with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictions; more importantly, they can resolve them. During this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period, we encourage Al-Will to not [do] too much conceptual thinking.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, with the slow approach you're taking, I can imagine that---
<br>
even if it took years---there would finally emerge someone who
<br>
remembered being Einstein and who remembered being The Bard.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then finally, when we have implanted all of Will's memories, we put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our subject on mind numbing drugs for the rest of the year..., and put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him though a routine, dull, and boring existence. This allows us to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid the pitfalls of &quot;who was I yesterday&quot; and such things; before we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wake him up&quot;, we can then fit both Al's and Will's memories into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category &quot;recent but not immediate past&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I had to do a trick in my own scenario to avoid the subject
<br>
suddenly thinking:  &quot;Wait!  Did I go to that movie or did I go to
<br>
that bookstore?&quot;, where neither seems plausible since it would
<br>
not include any trace of memory of the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lastly, the most important part: we wake up Al-Will, and have him
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve his own contradictions.
</em><br>
<p>A very, very long process, IMO, during which he very likely becomes
<br>
someone who is neither of those men.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some aspects of Al will fade away; so will some aspects of Will.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Others will complement and reinforce each other. His vision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his place in the world will be a fascinating thing to watch... I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would also like to see his politics!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does this sound imaginable?
</em><br>
<p>Yes it does, thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And if it is doable in the above sense, it's certainly also doable at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high speed and with a subject who doesn't agree to the process.
</em><br>
<p>So the Merge Machine would &quot;resolve his own contractions&quot; as
<br>
you wrote above, for him?  That borders on being non-computable,
<br>
as is, e.g., what the state of chaotic system will be in the far future.
<br>
The only way to find out is to let the system run. So am I to infer
<br>
that you would just speed up several years of brain development
<br>
in Al-Will's skull?  Okay.  But it may be non-computable to
<br>
try to take short cuts.
<br>
<p>The point being that merging two separate incidents or separate
<br>
days for close duplicates is child's play compared to that! You
<br>
go to Florence for a vacation, we duplicate you and your hotel
<br>
room, and in each case la policia burst into your hotel room
<br>
and take you in for interrogation.  But in one case, they're very
<br>
nice and wear blue uniforms, and in the other they're very mean
<br>
and wear black.  Later, after the merge, you'd be confused, but
<br>
you'd have to guess that either you'd suffered a little amnesia
<br>
or your imagination had played tricks. But you are still absolutely
<br>
the same person, even though you had a very weird day or two
<br>
in Italy.
