<em>&gt;&gt; [Lee wrote]     hey, Slawek, how come you don't put attributions at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;                        appropriate places in your posts---at least lately?
</em><br>
<p>Because I realized you don't do that. I was trying to make you more comfortable by
<br>
adopting your style of posting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's focus on this because this is where you are assuming what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm asking you to explain. Why is it important to be *like*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; something? As before, concept of  &quot;survival&quot; cannot be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in the explanation.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I haven't answered your last question. I sort of have to throw up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; my hands. I cannot explain why you don't want to be like certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; deformed people who have two heads, and I can't explain why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; you don't want to be &quot;like&quot; a rodent. We have to start somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Slawek.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Are you saying that preserving &quot;likeness&quot; is important because creatures that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are not like you experience lower quality of life?
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Certainly not.  I know people who experience much higher quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of life than I do.
</em><br>
<p>If you had said yes, I would have made this very point next.
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm surprised you'd make that particular guess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can't you imagine how inane or dumb it would sound if I were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say &quot;Yes. Yes, people and other things who are not me experience lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualities of life than I do&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>So can you please explain what point you were making when you said people don't
<br>
want to be like rodents?
<br>
<p>I suspect being like a rodent feels just fine to a rodent. What causes you to say
<br>
that you, human, don't want to be like a rodent? It's crucial that we identify what
<br>
it is, exactly, as it's the same thing that causes you to say, &quot;I want to remain 
<br>
like
<br>
Lee Corbin.&quot; If we rule out potential change in quality of life, then what is it? 
<br>
In your answer, please don't rely on our shared humanity, like common aversion to 
<br>
rodents. Explain this as if a rational alien that perhaps sees no big difference 
<br>
between rodents and humans asked you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There *are* other things I can be attached to, you know.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Like what?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; *This* instance of mind process responsible for perception and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; making sense of the world around me.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Thanks.  Okay, now I remember that from our discussions a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or two back.  What riles up JC and some others
</em><br>
<p>Let me stop you there. There have been NO others, just JKC.
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; perhaps, is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under anaesthesia, perhaps you believe your &quot;instance of mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process&quot; is ended?
</em><br>
<p>It's an objective fact. Even all cryonicists should have no problem acknowledging
<br>
this simple truth. An instance of any type of process ends when it stops. If you
<br>
catch a ball, its flight ends. What can be less confusing than that?
<br>
<p>What you are really asking me is whether I think *this* life ends whenever mind
<br>
stops and the answer is yes. I did not adopt this view because I liked it. In fact,
<br>
I hate it. Believe me, I was forced, kicking and screaming, by logic to agree with
<br>
the conclusion. I will always try to find something that will hopefully invalidate
<br>
this view, but, so far, I've been unsuccessful in my search. What's worse is that,
<br>
the more I think about it, the final conclusion seems more obvious in
<br>
retrospect.
<br>
<p>I would also like to make crystal clear that I don't care whether people go under
<br>
anesthesia or not because I don't really care if I'm interacting with a copy or an
<br>
original, as long as the copy is, and behaves, like the original. IOW, my quality
<br>
of experience is not affected regardless of whether I'm dealing with the original
<br>
or a copy.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Good, so can I infer from this that having runtime is also at least as important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to you as maintaining the same memories?
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; They're not directly comparable.  It would be like asking someone about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their favorite Elvis Presley album---oops, showing my age---CD. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question &quot;which is more important, that that CD actually exists or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get to listen to it now and then?&quot;  is kind of equivalent, to me.
</em><br>
<p>To recap, you believe person survives only when there exists a copy of his memories
<br>
AND these memories get runtime (true?), whereas I believe only uninterrupted
<br>
runtime is required.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I doubt Reagan's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; friends and family thought he was actually dead on June 4th 2004. I bet they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; thought he was very sick, and couldn't remember much, but not dead.
</em><br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  The friends and family used society's and language's conventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this regard, no matter what they privately thought. Language is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication, after all.  If questioned closely, many would concede
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he'd died slowly bit by bit, and was almost dead already. &lt;Insert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mini-lecture on the way that &quot;alive/dead&quot; dicotomy doesn't capture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is the real continuum very well, and that the cryonics literature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for one place, goes into great detail about all this by very thorough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent, and sensible people&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't respect cryonics literature all that much. I think medical
<br>
establishment is essentially correct when it claims that people die &quot;when the
<br>
electrical activity in their brain ceases [permanently].&quot; (
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death#Definition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death#Definition</a> ). My point continues to be that
<br>
&quot;amnesia&quot; is one thing, &quot;death&quot; is something else. I realize some cryonicists 
<br>
insist on inserting a
<br>
&quot;=&quot; between these two different concepts but I think that would be incorrect.
<br>
<p>Lee:
<br>
<em>&gt; Have I answered all your questions yet?  Please reply, because I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of my own.
</em><br>
<p>You still haven't answered the main question (the one I keep asking at the
<br>
beginning of my posts). You can always ask anything you want but please know that
<br>
we won't go very far until you're able to answer the original question or realize 
<br>
the answer doesn't exist.
