</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Truest existence and all implementations of that in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  emulations/universes are local instances of the ideal form.
</em><br>
<p>Now we know what to *implement* something means:  a computer may
<br>
implement a certain algorithm, for example.
<br>
<p>We also have a fairly good idea of what &quot;to simulate&quot; means because
<br>
of all the talk of the kind &quot;*this could be a simulation&quot;, where &quot;*this&quot;
<br>
is a pointer to all the universes very much like ours---so far indistinguishable
<br>
from the &quot;one&quot; live in.  (Every time, incidentally, that we discover a new
<br>
faraway star, we are living in a separate branch from those identical others
<br>
of ourselves who did not discover that star.)
<br>
<p>So, many years ago I said, &quot;Okay, but what if an advanced intelligence
<br>
simulates a human?&quot;  [Reacting to language that was going around at the
<br>
time.] &quot;Hell,&quot; sez I, &quot;doesn't a good actor simulate Hamlet?  Can't
<br>
an advanced AI---cool and vast and unsympathetic---be actually
<br>
simulating my good friend Joe?&quot; My answer was &quot;Horrors! Yes! It could!
<br>
Jumping Joe has left and gone away... oh, oh, oh.&quot;
<br>
<p>So I began using the term &quot;emulate&quot; to distinguish a sort of &quot;true simulation&quot;
<br>
from an ordinary simulation, i.e., when some machine, some computer,
<br>
for instance, *emulated* a human being.  We called it downloading in
<br>
the late 80's, but the ilk I hang around with quickly pointed out that it
<br>
should be called &quot;uploading&quot;.  I don't know who first introduced that very
<br>
nice change in nomenclature, but I know that the cryonics community and
<br>
some northern California types were using way before, say, Moravec,
<br>
who continued to use &quot;downloading&quot; for an embarrassingly long time after.
<br>
<p>So then tonight when Stathis wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Lee writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I don't quite understand this point. Aren't you being emulated by rocks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or maybe large rocks also?  Aren't you being emulated by some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  patches of dust between the galaxies?  Since you're being emulated in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  so many many places (assume for a moment our Level One universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is infinite like Tegmark says), surely the demise of a little bit of matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  in Australia (whether it's removed altogether from the universe, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  raised to 451 degrees Fahrenheit) can't make a difference, can it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I'm not being emulated by rocks, rocks and I are both being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emulated in Platonia.
</em><br>
<p>I recoiled in shock. Suddenly, I didn't know what was going on. What
<br>
is emulating what?  How?
<br>
<p>(I now rather think, by the way, that Stathis maybe should have said &quot;No,
<br>
I'm being *implemented* in Platonia&quot;.  And he might have corrected my
<br>
usage by something like &quot;Lee, no, I'm not being emulated by a rock,
<br>
the rock and I are on an equal footing, we're both being *implemented*
<br>
in Platonia&quot;.  Of course, I don't know yet if that's what Stathis might really
<br>
have thought or agreed with.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, I decided tonight to ask a friend of mine about the terms &quot;simulate&quot;
<br>
and &quot;emulate&quot;, who, by the way, was around at the time in the 50s and 60s
<br>
that he refers to, and was very active (and still keeps a hand) in the computer
<br>
field.
<br>
<p>Here is his response:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight over the words 'simulation' and 'emulation' goes back
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the middle 60's in CS [Computer Science] anyway.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then some preferred to refer to an ordinary program faking some  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computer as simulation, while when micro-code was used to the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same end, it would be called 'emulation'.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not impressed with the distinction and don't see that any  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinction is necessary.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the trick of dynamic translation translation to the native ISA,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulation was at least 20 times as slow as the real machine,  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neglecting circuit and architecture differences.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Attribution available upon request.)
<br>
<p>It seems to me, BTW, (I'll have to ask my friends) that the CS community
<br>
has shifted to using &quot;emulation&quot; to describe, say, an Intel machine as
<br>
being able to &quot;run&quot; old Apple machine-language code, although because
<br>
it has to work so hard to actually implement the step by step Apple
<br>
instructions, the *program's* processing andoutput is really slow.
<br>
<p>But you see, for our purposes, the program didn't &quot;know&quot; that it wasn't
<br>
running on Apple hardware, just as we might not know that we are living
<br>
in a simulation or a simulation of a simulation, etc.
<br>
<p>Now if the Apple Operating System (OS) were, say, conscious when
<br>
running, and a user says &quot;calculate this here for me&quot;, the Apple machine
<br>
thinks &quot;yessir, I always do what the user wants&quot;.  Well, the Apple
<br>
OS is having the same conscious experience that it would if it was really 
<br>
running on Apple hardware.  And the same goes for the Apple hardware:
<br>
if by the same stretch of imagination the Apple hardware were conscious,
<br>
then it wouldn't know that it was really being emulated (or simulated) by
<br>
the Intel and the Intel's OS.
<br>
<p>But it is *so* important to know whether your husband has been
<br>
successfully uploaded, or if the incredibly smart AI is just faking it
<br>
(though faking it well enough to fool you).  After all, if he's just
<br>
being faked---I call that simulation---then he's dead!  Yikes!
<br>
<p>So I will continue to insist that the goal of uploading is to emulate
<br>
a human consciousness, not simulate it, and we need some sort
<br>
of terminological distinction for this, if not the one I've been pushing
<br>
on this list and Extropians for five or ten years.
