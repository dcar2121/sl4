<em>&gt;&gt;  Again, I submit that there must be a *causal* connection between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Sj and its successor Sm, and that it be a *calculation*, i.e., that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Sm be *computed* from Sj.  And that if Sj arises solely by chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (or a child twiddly knobs) then it is not a bonafide computation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's very difficult to even define what counts as a causal link.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose you're in charge of the Tuesday computer and your friend gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you two files, one of which is Sj from the end of the Monday computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run while the other is not. If you input one of the files at random
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and it turns out to be Sj, does that count as a causal link?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, then we have a slightly new situation:  Sm is no longer the
<br>
first Tuesday state, but the second. Sj was (maybe) carried
<br>
by sneaker net to the Tuesday computer. That's just like being
<br>
ideally teleported!  :-)
<br>
<p>[I'm recalling that State-j was the last state of Monday, and
<br>
State-m was the first state of Tuesday, when ordinarily on
<br>
a normal computer Sj would give rise to Sm by the laws
<br>
of physics or their in-computer equivalent.]
<br>
<p>So in *no case* in your new scenario above is there a causal
<br>
link, i.e., what I mean, a &quot;computed link&quot; characterized by
<br>
computed information flow. The only computations in that
<br>
new scenario (with Sj being both the last state of Monday
<br>
and the first state of Tuesday) are the computations inside
<br>
the computer that go from Sa-&gt;Sb-&gt;...-&gt;Sj  and Sj-&gt;Sk-&gt;...
<br>
<p><p>Again, if Sm would arise strictly by chance on the Tuesday
<br>
computer, then this one state would---to me---fail to have
<br>
been computed. And so thereby inflict an infinitesimal break
<br>
in consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  To take a more extreme case, suppose again that the last seven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  minutes of Monday had suffered just this same lack of what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  call bonafide computation, and that all the states of those seven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  minutes had arisen strictly by chance. Then we begin the inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  downward spiral (e.g. see &quot;The Story of a Brain&quot; in Hofstadter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and Dennett's &quot;The Mind's I&quot;).  I say that it leads to ABSURDITY,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and the weak point in the chain MUST be this point at which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  as I say, &quot;no actual computing is done&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; If you drop that idea you may as well say that only brand name
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; neurons are capable of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No, I don't need to go that far!  :-)    My target is merely rocks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  being conscious, or patches of dust between here and the Hyades
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  supercluster being 0.99999999999 of Stathis's experience in life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, you *could* say that there is something fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-computable about the brain.
</em><br>
<p>Why do we want or need to go there?  What is the appeal to you
<br>
and Schmidhuber and the rest of the gang to all that dust comprising
<br>
0.99999999999 of your experience?  That would seem to me to
<br>
induce fatalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That would solve all the problems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't it? Patching up functionalism so that it doesn't lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparently absurd conclusions (even though these conclusions may still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be compatible with observed reality) sounds to me a bit like patching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up quantum theory with &quot;wave function collapse&quot; in order to avoid the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent absurdity of the MWI.
</em><br>
<p>Well, just between you and me, I stopped being a true absolute
<br>
functionalist a long time ago. There is the terrible problem of the
<br>
GLUT which &lt;choke&gt; &lt;damn me&gt; is a &lt;gasp&gt; zombie. It could
<br>
sit down to tea with you and pass every test. So I seize upon
<br>
&quot;information flow&quot;, and time chauvinism as a sailor thrown overboard
<br>
seizes upon some floating wreckage. Besides, I could never accept
<br>
the &quot;Theory of Dust&quot; (Permutation City) or the idea that rocks can
<br>
be conscious anyway.  But I'm up for talking about the GLUT zombie
<br>
in a different thread if you are  :-)
