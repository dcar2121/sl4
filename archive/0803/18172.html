<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; [Lee wrote]     hey, Slawek, how come you don't put attributions at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;                        appropriate places in your posts---at least lately?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I realized you don't do that. I was trying to make you more comfortable by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopting your style of posting.
</em><br>
<p>Yes I do.  At the top of every post I say who said something. Later
<br>
on, when I think it's &quot;obvious&quot; I drop it.  But mistakes can be made  :-)
<br>
See how it says &quot;Heartland writes&quot; up there?  I don't think that you'll
<br>
even find one post I wrote on this list where I don't do that---even
<br>
if I do issue a preamble of sorts first.
<br>
<p>A convention that I and many use is this:  if there are an even number
<br>
of &quot;&gt;&quot; symbols (and 0 is an even number) then it is either the author of
<br>
the present post, or someone else that is two levels back.  In the latter
<br>
case, that writer usually should be identified. But sometimes it truly
<br>
is irrelevant, and there really is no need to.
<br>
<p>Now on one other list I could mention  :-)  sometimes, but very very
<br>
rarely, I'll get into the spirit of the thing if people are just posting
<br>
funny one-liners.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you saying that preserving &quot;likeness&quot; is important because creatures that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; are not like you experience lower quality of life?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Certainly not.  I know people who experience much higher quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of life than I do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you had said yes, I would have made this very point next.
</em><br>
<p>Okay. Then the above can be snipped next time.  I should snip it this
<br>
time, but honestly I'm not so sure that you do your share of snipping.
<br>
(That might be totally unfair; I could be confusing you with someone
<br>
else.) Anyway, surely *this* paragraph itself can be snipped, thanks.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'm surprised you'd make that particular guess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Can't you imagine how inane or dumb it would sound if I were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to say &quot;Yes. Yes, people and other things who are not me experience lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; qualities of life than I do&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So can you please explain what point you were making when you said people don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to be like rodents?
</em><br>
<p>I'll have to dig back through my posts. But let me start this way:
<br>
<p>People don't want to be as small as rodents, or have as short a lifespan, or
<br>
have as little intelligence, or be so ugly (in human bias). There are also
<br>
surely many other features of rodents in general that people in general
<br>
do not want.
<br>
<p>In general, people don't want to be drastically different than they already
<br>
are. Not only do they not want to be elephants and amoeba, they don't
<br>
want to be other people.  If asked, &quot;Do you wish that you were Vladimir
<br>
Putin?&quot;, they'll generally say no, but if you ask them if they'd like to be
<br>
like &lt;insert famous and greatly admired Hollywood actor or actress&gt;,
<br>
then they may say yes.&quot;  What they *mean* by that, however, is not
<br>
that suddenly there are two Brad Pitts or whatever, but that they had
<br>
the money, or the fame, or the skill, or the good looks of Brad Pitt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect being like a rodent feels just fine to a rodent. What causes you to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you, human, don't want to be like a rodent?
</em><br>
<p>Dealt with above.  I also expanded the answer to include other animals,
<br>
and even other people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's crucial that we identify what it is, exactly, as it's the same thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that causes you to say, &quot;I want to remain like Lee Corbin.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>We are not yet sure that it is the *same* thing.  I may have other
<br>
reasons for wanting to remain Lee Corbin besides acquiring the
<br>
characteristics of rodents.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we rule out potential change in quality of life, then what is it? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In your answer, please don't rely on our shared humanity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like common aversion to rodents.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Explain this as if a rational alien that perhaps sees no big difference 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between rodents and humans asked you.
</em><br>
<p>Rational alien?  Any alien that can not appreciate the difference between
<br>
humans, rodents, elephants, amoeba, and dogs would be stupid enough
<br>
in his misunderstanding of how evolution works that it would not have
<br>
been smart enough to get here.  Those differences are *objectively* real.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ...is [it] that under anaesthesia, perhaps you believe your &quot;instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of mind process&quot; is ended?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's an objective fact. Even all cryonicists should have no problem acknowledging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this simple truth. An instance of any type of process ends when it stops. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catch a ball, its flight ends. What can be less confusing than that?
</em><br>
<p>Just checking. Just confirming that you believe that what you value
<br>
really would be lost if you take anaesthesia.  Right?  I mean, you
<br>
would refuse general anaesthesia if you went to a hospital and 
<br>
the doctors were going to perform an exceedingly, exceedingly
<br>
painful operation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What you are really asking me is whether I think *this* life ends whenever mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stops and the answer is yes. I did not adopt this view because I liked it. In fact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hate it. Believe me, I was forced, kicking and screaming, by logic to agree with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conclusion.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, we're in the same boat (but using different paddles)!
<br>
I was forced kicking and screaming many years ago to conclude
<br>
that technically, very technically, functionalism is false (given 
<br>
certain very unrealistic possibilities involving computronium
<br>
and GLUTs).  But Like you, I felt I had no choice. But of course
<br>
this digression should be snipped.  I just said as an aside  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will always try to find something that will hopefully invalidate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this view, but, so far, I've been unsuccessful in my search.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's worse is that, the more I think about it, the final
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion seems more obvious in retrospect.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that can happen even if one is dead wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would also like to make crystal clear that I don't care whether people go under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anesthesia or not because I don't really care if I'm interacting with a copy or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original, as long as the copy is, and behaves, like the original. IOW, my quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of experience is not affected regardless of whether I'm dealing with the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a copy.
</em><br>
<p>Would you like for someone you love to go under anesthesia?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Good, so can I infer from this that having runtime is also at least as important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; to you as maintaining the same memories?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; They're not directly comparable.  It would be like asking someone about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; their favorite Elvis Presley album---oops, showing my age---CD. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; question &quot;which is more important, that that CD actually exists or that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you get to listen to it now and then?&quot;  is kind of equivalent, to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To recap, you believe person survives only when there exists a copy of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories AND these memories get runtime (true?), whereas I believe only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uninterrupted runtime is required.
</em><br>
<p>I think that's correct.  Of course, a running instance in my view need have
<br>
no separate copy of his memories except the one he's running with at the
<br>
moment.  But you probably meant that.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt Reagan's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; friends and family thought he was actually dead on June 4th 2004. I bet they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; thought he was very sick, and couldn't remember much, but not dead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes.  The friends and family used society's and language's conventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in this regard, no matter what they privately thought. Language is for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; communication, after all.  If questioned closely, many would concede
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that he'd died slowly bit by bit, and was almost dead already. &lt;Insert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mini-lecture on the way that &quot;alive/dead&quot; dicotomy doesn't capture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what is the real continuum very well, and that the cryonics literature,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for one place, goes into great detail about all this by very thorough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intelligent, and sensible people&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I don't respect cryonics literature all that much. I think medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishment is essentially correct when it claims that people die &quot;when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electrical activity in their brain ceases [permanently].&quot; (
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death#Definition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death#Definition</a> ).
</em><br>
<p>Actually, we cryonicists agree with that in the sense that if
<br>
we *knew* for absolute certain that a frozen person would
<br>
never be revived, we would consider that indeed he had died.
<br>
I only refer to the large body of cryonics literature to show
<br>
that I'm hardly alone in my beliefs, nor did I originate the
<br>
one's we're discussing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My point continues to be that  &quot;amnesia&quot; is one thing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;death&quot; is something else. I realize some cryonicists 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insist on inserting a &quot;=&quot; between these two different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts but I think that would be incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Have I answered all your questions yet?  Please reply, because I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; some of my own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You still haven't answered the main question (the one I keep asking at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning of my posts). You can always ask anything you want but please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that we won't go very far until you're able to answer the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question or realize the answer doesn't exist.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry---what question is that?  Can you repeat it, please?  I will
<br>
try again to answer it.
<br>
