<p><em>&gt; [To recap, we have a machine and operator in Australia and another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine and operator in Vienna. The question is whether the Viennese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine can continue the computation of the Australian machine, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether any associated consciousness also continues without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interruption. S(n) is the last state of the Australian machine which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Australian operator notes and passes on, either explicitly or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hidden in false data, to his Viennese counterpart, who then endeavours
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to calculate or look up the next state S(n+1) to input into his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine.]
</em><br>
<p>Excellent summary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  I see.  In other words, it's as though the Vienna operator, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  very smart dude, works out *himself* with, say, his pocket
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  calculator, S(n+1). Quite all right with me.  I don't think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  ever matters where a computation is done, nor on what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  hardware.  Just so that it's a real computation, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  sustains real causality and information flow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you will hopefully allow that in this step, working out the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state could involve a lookup table. This low level lookup simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mimics the physics of the machine, and is not like looking up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer to a computation in order to bypass all the intermediate steps.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  The lower the level of the lookup table in a computation apparently
<br>
isomorphic to a conscious being, the more consciousness is retained. 
<br>
Looking up very small patches in Conway's Life (i.e., just as a crude
<br>
guess, patches less than 100x100) has utterly no effect on consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; i.e. the same as if the Vienna operator knew nothing about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; antipodean device and simply tried random states, one of them just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; happening to be S(n+1). How does this affect whether consciousness is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; interrupted?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Very good question.  In that case there is an infinitesimal interruption in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  consciousness, because there was no genuine information flow or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  causality, in other words, to me, not a real computation at all. All
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  possible things are tried in Vienna.  I think I see where you are going,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  but I'll let you deliver the next blow!  :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would it make a difference if the Viennese operator worked out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate state? Here are several possibilities:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) The file I've received says that the final state of the Australian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine was S-6754. The successor state for that is S-2037, so if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input that into my machine, the computation won't know it has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread across two continents.
</em><br>
<p>How did you get a hold of S-2037?   If you looked it up somewhere,
<br>
or heard from a little bird that you should try S-2037, then the answer
<br>
would be no. But if you worked out, i.e., your brain emulated the
<br>
machine itself, i.e. calculated state S-2037 from S-6754, then yes,
<br>
no infinitesiaml interruption occurred.  (And just for the record, no tiny
<br>
interruptions in consciousness matter much to me.  They have to be
<br>
significantly many, consecutive or not, over some given period of time.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (b) The file I've received gives the final state of the Australian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine as either S-6754 or S-789. Their respective successor states
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are S-2037 and S-9175, so I'll try both of those, and when I get the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right one, the computation and its consciousness will have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented without interruption.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. The other run will either occur entirely incorrectly, or, after
<br>
somehow getting back on track, will suffer even more than that
<br>
tiny interruption of consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (c) The file from Australia lists all possible machine states S-1 to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S-9999. I have a lot of work ahead of me, but one of them has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right one. First, I'll input S-1, the successor state of S-3412;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then S-2, which as everyone knows is the successor state of S-439;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next, S-3, successor of S-2031 (or was it S-3021? I always get those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two mixed up but it's definitely one or the other)... and so on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; S-9999.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Unless I've missed something, I think that this is just the
<br>
logical next step after (b), and so the answer is should be just
<br>
the same. All of these here in (c) seem to me to implement a
<br>
computation that has one non-causal step, i.e., a tiny tiny
<br>
lapse of consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can see that the Vienna operator's muttering as he goes about his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work in the last example has no effect on the mechanics of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation. As he inputs S-2037 he could be thinking that it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successor of S-6754, or he could be thinking about what he will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for dinner, and it will make no difference to his behaviour as he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just inputting all the states anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In which of the above cases is the causal link between the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines preserved? In which does consciousness continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uninterrupted?
</em><br>
<p>I believe that I have answered. In some cases, the state S-2037 
<br>
really was computed in a local calculation, and in some cases it
<br>
was gotten by chance, more or less. In the former there were no
<br>
interruptions of consciousness, but in the latter there were.
