</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I did not find that isomorphism obvious enough.  My initial
<br>
confusion was related (i think) to the notion of your bit string in
<br>
Platonia - which made no sense that it should be a different string
<br>
from day to day.  Now I realize that each byte position could be a
<br>
measure of separate dimensions, some of which might be temporal - and
<br>
that the string always represents a fixed point (Lee) measured from a
<br>
moving observer.
<br>
<p>There also exist some cases of similar that are completely ambiguous.
<br>
Less Than (&lt;) and Greater Than (&gt;) symbols may be similar in that they
<br>
identical after a simple rotational translation.  Depending on our
<br>
choice of font, the letters p and d share rotational similarity.  d
<br>
and b share the same similarity as q and p.  Is there a similarity
<br>
function for how p and b are first-order similar, or are they similar
<br>
through a two step transformation where first p -&gt; d then d -&gt; b ?
<br>
I'm surprised if you are still with me.  It's completely fine if you
<br>
are not.
<br>
<p>We could of course agree on the common usage of similar and trust that
<br>
the net ambiguity will cancel on either side of the conversation.
<br>
<p>If we were to provide a greater measure of similarity (as in your
<br>
thermometer example) I suggest the function by which two candidate
<br>
entities are compared must necessarily be stated.  I could define a
<br>
translation where
<br>
A) 10110010 &lt;-&gt; B) 01001101 are similar because they are binary
<br>
compliments of each other.  The same strings could be similar because
<br>
generally F( A(n) ) = F( B( len(B)-n+1 ) ) for every integer byte
<br>
position n &gt;= 1 to n &lt;= len(B) aka the first string is identical to
<br>
the inverse byte order of the second.  Now I have two definitions of
<br>
similar for the same strings.  If I declare we are discussing the
<br>
strings' similarity, we may be in agreement until I declare that 101
<br>
and 010 are similar by measure 1 (binary compliment) and you are using
<br>
measure 2 (reverseability).  Unfortunately if that declaration is not
<br>
made until after several further agreements along a proof, then it
<br>
causes a great deal of frustration and confusion when those agreements
<br>
are no longer valid and must be revoked.
<br>
<p>I feel this point is relevant to this list because it illustrates a
<br>
type of problem that a general intelligence will have to face trying
<br>
to communicate with another intelligence.  Not all isomorphisms are
<br>
obvious.  If language (communication protocol) is something that must
<br>
evolve between two parties then it will be important to understand how
<br>
this mechanism works.  I am unsure how to frame this thought as a
<br>
primitive function of learning.  Until I am able, I feel it is
<br>
worthwhile to discuss examples (above) of a class of behavior I
<br>
haven't yet modeled well enough.
