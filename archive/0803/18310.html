<p>If consciousness is Turing emulable, then it is GOL emulable. Suppose
<br>
we have a large Life Board which is emulating a human mind,
<br>
interfacing with a camera, microphone and loudspeaker so that it has
<br>
vision, hearing and speech. The emulation is shown a picture of a dog
<br>
and asked to describe it, which it does, just as well as you or I
<br>
might. Next, a change is made to a patch of the Board so that those
<br>
squares are looked up rather than calculated. This patch is large
<br>
enough that it causes the theorised diminution in conscious
<br>
experience. The emulation is still looking at the dog and describing
<br>
what it is seeing as the change is made. What happens?
<br>
<p>If there is a change in consciousness then the emulation notices that
<br>
the picture has suddenly gone blurry, or one of the dog's legs has
<br>
disappeared, or whatever (we can imagine that the looked-up patch
<br>
increases in size until the change in visual perception becomes
<br>
noticeable). So, as per your instructions, the emulation tries to
<br>
report this change. However, there is a problem: the squares on the
<br>
Board which interface with the loudspeaker are *exactly the same* as
<br>
they would have been if the looked-up patch had actually been
<br>
calculated. So the emulation would be saying, &quot;It's the same picture
<br>
of a dog, try looking up a larger patch of squares&quot;, while thinking,
<br>
&quot;Oh no, I'm going blind, and my mouth is saying stuff all on its
<br>
own!&quot;. But how is this possible unless you posit a disembodied soul,
<br>
which becomes decoupled from the emulation and goes on to have its own
<br>
separate thoughts?
<br>
<p>The other possibility is that there is a change to visual perception
<br>
which is not actually noticed. When all the squares relating to visual
<br>
perception are looked up the emulation becomes blind, but it doesn't
<br>
realise it's blind and continues to accurately describe what is shown
<br>
to it, using zombie vision. This is almost as implausible, and begs
<br>
the question of what it means to perceive something.
<br>
<p>The above is a variation on Chalmers' &quot;Fading Qualia&quot; argument:
<br>
<p><a href="http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html">http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html</a>
<br>
<p>(I might add that many cognitive scientists don't like Chalmers due to
<br>
his insistence that there is a &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness, but in
<br>
actual fact, he is mostly an orthodox computationalist, and the above
<br>
paper probably presents the strongest case for consciousness surviving
<br>
neural replacement scenarios.)
