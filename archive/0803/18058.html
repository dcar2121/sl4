<em>&gt;&gt; Beyond the simple claim that it exists (which is true),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; what intellectual good has ever come from discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; subjective experiences?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an excellent question and it raises an important point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Typically, questions in the realm of objectivity can be addressed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science, while those in the subjective realm are the province of philosophy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and religion.  However, the very concept of &quot;Friendly AI&quot; places us in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strange realm where these two perspectives overlap in a relevant way.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notions of friendliness, ethics, morality, empathy, and the like, have both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective and subjective aspects to them.  My personal morality is not based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strictly on evolutionary psychology or cultural programming, but in part on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deep reflection about subjective experience and the assumption that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans experience the same.
</em><br>
<p>That seems eminently reasonable to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suppose my morality boils down to recognizing that my actions can impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people's subjective experience and taking responsibility for that knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  For example, if you found out that a certain acquaintance of yours
<br>
was really just being &quot;played&quot; by a vast and cool and unsympathetic
<br>
intelligence who studies us all under a microscope, then you wouldn't
<br>
act to save your acquaintance from physical harm as soon as you'd
<br>
act to save a poodle.  Yeah, if I found out that someone was just a
<br>
simulation of a person (as opposed to *emulation*) then I'd be much
<br>
more callous about what happened to him, (or in truth, the empty
<br>
shell whose strings were being pulled by someone who wouldn't
<br>
suffer when he appeared to be in pain).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this sense, at least for me, subjective experience is directly relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to morality and friendliness, and these issues are the whole point of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion group.
</em><br>
<p>What I don't understand is why these things can't be discussed in
<br>
objective terms?  Frankly, that's what most people here, it seems
<br>
to me, are wont to do.  Just how much more can you say about
<br>
subjective experience beyond 
<br>
<p>1. we think that all of us have it
<br>
2. it probably is a necessary consequence of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way animal brains work,
<br>
3. that almost surely an AI (friendly or not) would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have one, and
<br>
4. we non-sociopaths don't want harm to come to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creatures that have them?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Lee
