<p>
Matt also inquires
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it bad to be tortured and then have the state of your mind reset to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earlier time so that you had no memory of it?
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes, quite bad. To prove it, suppose that you are indeed
<br>
awakened every night at 3pm and tortured for an hour, and
<br>
then have the memory erased, but you get $1000 deposited
<br>
to your bank account for each hour. &quot;Big deal if I don't remember
<br>
the torture&quot;, you might say.
<br>
<p>But before I get to &quot;the proof&quot;, let me say that on the face of
<br>
it you should be suspicious of this proposition. This is because
<br>
an objective determination of how well your life went would
<br>
sample those hours with the same weight as other hours. You
<br>
don't want that.
<br>
<p>Now let's change the TE (thought experiment) slightly. This time
<br>
you are awakened as before at 3pm, but imprisoned ten years
<br>
in a hideous, pitiful prison somewhere, where the food is marginal
<br>
but you have plenty, plenty of time to think and reflect. Moreover,
<br>
we also add that the during the ten years you are able to remember
<br>
what happened &quot;the night before&quot;, i.e., the last time you were
<br>
awakened and imprisoned for ten years.  Oh, I should have added,
<br>
---if you didn't figure it out---that this prison manages to compress
<br>
ten years in-prison time into a single hour of outside time.
<br>
<p>You would then see what your life has become. Your perpetual,
<br>
miserable existence in prison would be the reality, and the little
<br>
24 hours outside episodes merely a weird interruption, during
<br>
which you didn't have a clue as to what your real life was about.
<br>
So we see that experience is what matters, and whether you
<br>
retain the memories is secondary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it bad to program a false memory of being tortured into your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain without actually inflicting pain?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it certainly is, as you know.  It gives you the willies to recall
<br>
the episode, even if you know it didn't really happen (a variation).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you had to choose between these two options, which would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you choose?
</em><br>
<p>Alas, there is the horrible Clock/Torture experiment that perhaps
<br>
I'll describe later. The bottom line is that you should always prefer
<br>
to get only the memories---but tragically you will eventually choose
<br>
the worse option, namely the experience without the memories.
<br>
