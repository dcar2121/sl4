</em><br>
<p>I have a technical objection.  A highly skilled human actor who
<br>
has studied video tapes of you for years, (not to mention a vast
<br>
and cold and unsympathetic AI who has studied you)  might
<br>
&quot;do as you do&quot;, and be perceived by _other people_ as you
<br>
are perceived by them.  But that hardly means that either the actor
<br>
or the AI---each of which may be just coldly going through a
<br>
pantomime---is anything like the genuine you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you accept this reasoning, then what constitutes a &quot;person&quot;--whose  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyday actions in the social realm are defined by learned, conscious,  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but mostly unconscious behaviors--is lost when our memories are lost.
</em><br>
<p>Well, indeed I totally agree with your conclusions, but not with
<br>
your reasoning   :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What defines &quot;lost&quot; in this case (could memories be retrieved? is  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there a difference between memories lost due to physical, rather than  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychical, damage?) is a whole other--and fantastically interesting-- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  I mean, what is the appeal of the question? Isn't it a simple
<br>
matter?  I.e., if the information constituting the memories is really
<br>
and permanently lost/destroyed, then what difference does it make
<br>
how they were destroyed?  Well, maybe I've done no more here
<br>
than to inform you what I mean by &quot;lost&quot;.  But all the people I
<br>
know, and especially in the cryonics community, I think totally
<br>
share my terminology here.
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
Lee
