</em><br>
<p>Sorry about the html, I thought I had turned that off in gmail.  It
<br>
probably also explains why so few of my posts get responses.  Thanks
<br>
for the reminder.
<br>
<p>I think we've agreed to many things.  That's my seriously snipped summary.  :)
<br>
<p>I'm happy to clear the slate and focus on this:
<br>
<p>I understand there may be value in retaining atomic details of every
<br>
transaction.  The transaction record may be later mined for further
<br>
patterns that were not observed from an initial investigation.
<br>
<p>I offer this scenario:  Your wife asks how your day was.  You say, &quot;It
<br>
was fine&quot; (because you really don't care to relive your day to provide
<br>
the details)  You then realize that what she was really asking was,
<br>
&quot;Are you going to ask me about MY day&quot; so you reciprocate with, &quot;And
<br>
how was your day?&quot;  Now tell me, what amount of data do you record
<br>
from the next 20 minutes of downloading she attempts to convey?  I
<br>
believe you would in-principle say that you have recorded every nuance
<br>
of that 20 minutes.  You might honestly say that you absorbed the
<br>
relevant bits and could tell me the &quot;gist&quot; of it were I to ask you.
<br>
She probably would say you weren't paying attention at all.  OK, I
<br>
don't know if you have a wife or are a good listener, etc.  It's
<br>
contrived in 2nd person so you might more easily identify with it.
<br>
<p>If the physical universe real-time has an effectively unlimited
<br>
resolution and bandwidth (granted: a debatable assumption)  You face
<br>
death of your human body.  You can be uploaded with the following
<br>
limitation on technology.  The bandwidth to memory is a fixed constant
<br>
(let's say due to electromagnetic storage constraints).  However, the
<br>
bandwidth bringing data into your 'brain' can exceed the bandwidth to
<br>
memory by several orders of magnitude (it's 100% optical)
<br>
<p>Do you tune your input rate down in order to accurately &quot;remember&quot;
<br>
everything you perceive?
