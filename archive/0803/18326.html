<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Noticeable to whom?  Here is what I think is going on: *naturally*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the subject, the person who's supposed to be having experiences,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  can report nothing different than what he would report anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  All the states that his brain would have reached (under what I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;totally authentic computation&quot;) would still be reached. So in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  certain sense, he *doesn't* notice any difference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  But in another sense he does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;But in another sense he does&quot;. I can see how you might say this if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a period of looked up computation (LUC) alternating with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; period of totally authentic computation (TAC): the person behaves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; normally during the LUC, and during the period of TAC recalls the LUC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences, but these are actually false memories, as there were no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual experiences during the LUC.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, the case I was considering was where the TAC and LUC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are occurring simultaneously, in the two halves of the GOL board.
</em><br>
<p>A very telling case.  Thanks for bringing the focus of the discussion to it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This might result in, say, zombie vision but normal hearing, or zombie
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aesthetic appreciation but normal arithmetical ability.
</em><br>
<p>Or could result even if any of these processes has undergone what
<br>
you  would call 50% zombiefication. That is, for example, the email
<br>
you are reading is being written by someone who has several
<br>
reasons to doubt that he is being anything but normally computed.
<br>
Yet there are extremes, such as you bring up, in which I do indeed
<br>
claim that it is theoretically possible for me to believe (or part of 
<br>
me to believe, at any rate) that I am having fully computed experience,
<br>
yet for the reality to be different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you were 100% zombie no external observer would know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you would (in a sense) know, since you would not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having experiences.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that you should try in any way whatsoever to say
<br>
that this is a sort-of &quot;knowing&quot; or a sort-of &quot;experience&quot;, any
<br>
more than it would be advisable to suggest that the chair
<br>
on the far side of the room is in anyway a knowing Lee
<br>
or a feeling Stathis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But is it possible that your brain is partly zombified right now,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the normal, conscious part systematically deluded into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking that it can see when in fact it is completely blind?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;normal, conscious part&quot;. 
<br>
One possibility is that only my speech centers are being
<br>
authentically computed while the rest of my cortex is
<br>
being merely looked up. I would be having very, very
<br>
little in the way of experience, of course.
<br>
<p>So what difference does it make? See the choice, again,
<br>
between A and B below.
<br>
<p>As for a normally functioning cortex, already it's aware in
<br>
a certain sense of the visual area known as V1. If this were
<br>
being looked up, that would make extremely little difference,
<br>
since all it's doing anyway is transferring images from the
<br>
retina with rather little processing added.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you allow the possibility of partial zombification then you have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow that not only can an external observer never know a person's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective experiences, but the person himself can never be sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he is having the experiences he believes he is having. This seems a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high price to pay in order to maintain that a LUC cannot be conscious.
</em><br>
<p>You are entirely correct.  It is a high price. I wish I knew of any
<br>
other way out. But it does not seem to me to be so high as the
<br>
price paid by you and others, namely, that only a tiny bit of your
<br>
consciousness is associated with a certain body in a certain city
<br>
on planet Earth, and that the vast, vast, vast majority of your
<br>
experience takes place in other objects, or---in another matter
<br>
of speaking---doesn't take place at all, but only corresponds
<br>
to prior existing patterns existing only in Platonia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Now, let me phrase my answer using an experiment so that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  no mistaking my meaning.  Question:  would you prefer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (A)  to be tortured for an hour in the old-fashioned way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  (B)  for records of such an hour merely to be retrieved from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        a galaxy far, far away a long time ago in which you were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        tortured just the same, and merely the states for that hour
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        interval brought to Earth and at the proper moment merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;        looked up?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess it depends on whether the looking up of the records repeats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experience which is what we are debating. If the recording were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate down to the atomic level then yes, I think it would reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same experience as the original.
</em><br>
<p>To be precise, an entire state is swapped into the location where you
<br>
reside once every trillionth of a second. None of the states is causally
<br>
connected to any of the others:  they could even have been retrieved
<br>
from extremely disparate and separated areas of intergalactic space,
<br>
by some random process that just happened to find patches of dust.
<br>
(Those, by an amazing coincidence, do happen to be the same states
<br>
that are now being computed, a trillion to the second, in the city where
<br>
you live, by the ordinary metabolic processes (computations).)
<br>
<p>So can you recapitulate and answer (A) or (B) for sure?  Thanks.
<br>
For of course, if your answer differs from mine, I have further
<br>
questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The argument above proves that a functionally perfect simulation of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain must be as conscious as the brain *unless* partial zombification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is possible. The possibility of mind uploading is something else you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have to give up if a LUC [looked up computation] cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  Uploading is entirely orthogonal to the argument we're having.
<br>
The only feasible way to upload someone is to entirely simulate with near
<br>
perfect fidelity the actual computations his or her brain is already achieving.
<br>
Whether I or some part of me could in theory be &quot;looked up&quot; now is
<br>
exactly the same issue as to whether some part of me could be &quot;looked up&quot;
<br>
after I'm uploaded.
