<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No drugs involved.  Just a *very* complicated problem with a surprisingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple solution that takes some time and effort to convey.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The way to clearly disprove my theory (and the ability to be disproven is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the key to any good theory) is to do one of the two following things:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Show me how I (or an AGI) can stay true to the declaration and still perform
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a horrible *and* unethical act OR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Show me a set of circumstances where my Friendliness declaration prevents me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or an AGI) from protecting myself
</em><br>
<p>This is a false dichotomy. Neither me, nor other Singularitarians, nor
<br>
the AI, nor reality are obligated to choose between your two
<br>
predefined options.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; You are just talking about rational choice theory, which neither says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much of anything about human action which is frequently irrational, nor does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it ensure that an AGI would choose to be friendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not *just* talking about rational choice theory.  I am proposing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulation that I argue that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will prevent the an entity who implements from performing any horrible and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unethical act AND
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once an entity understands this formulation, that entity will see via
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational choice theory that it is in its own self-interest to implement it
</em><br>
<p>How could this possibly be in the self-interest of, say, a paperclip
<br>
optimizer? It will obviously be able to create many more paperclips if
<br>
it ignores your (to the UFAI) funny-sounding pulses in fiberoptic
<br>
cables and just turns the Earth into a big pile of microscopic
<br>
paperclips.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt; At the very least you could have tried to prove this with symbolic logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or something. If you had tried, I'm sure you would find the formulas don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.  Prove me wrong by doing one of the two things above.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be easy if my theory is as laughably wrong as you believe.
</em><br>
<p>By my count, four different people have now challenged your theory, so
<br>
there's plenty of other things to say. Stop repeating this
<br>
unreasonable demand; it isn't getting anyone anywhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Take one of Eliezer's examples of an AGI that loves smiley faces
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Trust me.  I started with that example.  The AGI starts with my Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal of &quot;Do not act contrary to someone's/anyone's goals unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely necessary for the fulfillment of a reasonable/rational personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal (explicitly not including generic sub-goals like money, power,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure, religion, etc.&quot;).
</em><br>
<p>Why does it even have this supergoal in the first place?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It then recognizes that filling the universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with smiley faces, as awesome as it is, is also going to be to the detriment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all of it's other goals
</em><br>
<p>What other goals? An AI's goal system can be much, much simpler than a
<br>
human's. There's no reason why it has to have any other goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; since *every* other entity is the universe is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to resist rather than assisting it.  For a powerful enough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single-goal entity that is sure that it *can* overcome all other entities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is not going to stop it -- but this is a fantasy edge-case that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be able to easily avoid.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it is probably the default case, and a large number of us
<br>
are operating off that assumption (it's the conservative scenario).
<br>
See <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/AIRisk.pdf">http://www.intelligence.org/AIRisk.pdf</a>.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  *Any* sufficiently intelligent multi-goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity (or any entity that realizes that it is not powerful enough to take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on *the entire universe*) is going to recognize that this path is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seriously sub-optimal for it fulfilling the vast majority of it's goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;  Acid test over, you lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't concur.  Please try again.  The easiest path is to disprove one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the two things above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And thank you for spending the time to answer.
