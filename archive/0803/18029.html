<p><em>&gt; Not according to my definition because germs don't have goals.  Having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals is the lower bound for applying Friendliness.  There is also the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the existence of harmful germs is directly contrary to your personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals of health but if non-harmful germs had goals then you are obligated to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid wiping them out as much as you can without *unnecessarily*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compromising your goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>germs have goals: To reproduce.  Let's call them an extremely weak mechanism
<br>
of a single-minded replicator .  The germ analogy was really just to set up
<br>
the scenario where you would easily dismiss the trivially important &quot;lesser&quot;
<br>
species.  It could have been the more common ants or bees, although
<br>
ants/bees do belong to a colony/hive so imply a collection in their nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Suppose now the collection of ME is a world government of humans
</em><br>
colonizing our solar system or the galaxy at large.  Those amoeba are now
<br>
individual aliens that have not yet reached OneWorld Civilization status.
<br>
Suppose they are each as capable an intelligence as yourself.  Would your
<br>
answer to wanton UnFriendliness be the same if we terraformed their
<br>
methane-based atmosphere to support human life?  What if They were doing it
<br>
to Us ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both cases are nasty, nasty, nasty because the larger power could have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone somewhere else and not obliterated the lesser.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>explain &quot;nasty&quot;.  Just because the larger power could have gone elsewhere
<br>
does not mean that it was a profitable use of resources to do so.  It only
<br>
takes deciding (as you have done) the lesser power is insignificant or lacks
<br>
sufficient goals (which may be an failure to properly model the species) to
<br>
allow genocide without breaching Friendliness.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  No, but intelligent action dictates that ensure that our versions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness are compatible or else I ask you to include in your version of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness that it is not compatible with my version.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>as above, we may have a problem detecting &quot;intelligent action&quot; from the
<br>
other party.  I agree that it is not as much an ethical issue to
<br>
accidentally allow harm, but it would still be inexcusable to use ignorance
<br>
to justify unfortunate behavior.  I understand this does not per se
<br>
invalidate the declaration of Friendly.  I guess our inaction to save the
<br>
less fortunate bacteria during our germ cleanup could be considered an
<br>
UnFriendly action by a third party.  In this case, our blundering ignorance
<br>
could get us black-listed from the Friendly Society because we're just too
<br>
ignorant.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Further, the most critical point is the primary overriding goal.  If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both agree on it, then we are compatible and the rest is really just details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of how we protect ourselves.  If we don't agree on it, then we are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compatible and we simply treat each other as non-hostile non-Friendlies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (which is very different from an UnFriendly) which is relatively harmless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but not to our mutual advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>In a sufficiently plentiful environment it might be acceptable to live and
<br>
let live.  Our appetite for resources in a zero-sum universe prohibit such a
<br>
Utopian view.  The Haves in our world already have much/most of the
<br>
resources.  I would argue that they make a good case for claiming that with
<br>
even more resources they might be able to do more to find/create energy that
<br>
would allow the Have-Not to get some.  ex:  If I had 30 million dollars I
<br>
could give to Richard Loosemore in 10M checks over the next three years, he
<br>
claims to be able to deliver AGI.  Do I believe I can purchase something
<br>
that promises an ROI countless orders of magnitude in excess of my measely
<br>
30M investment, or am I merely making Loosemore 30M richer than he is now?
<br>
Honestly, I wish I had the problem of deciding how to invest $30M.  :)
