<p><em>&gt; I don't see how what you suggest is possible. A computer, or a brain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a finite state machine.  We might note that Monday = {Si...Sj} and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tuesday = {Sm...Sn}, i.e. a discrete number of states covering each of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the days. Where is the extra information that allows the observer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience to differ depending on whether the computations are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causally connected?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps you missed my reply to Nick.  As I wrote to him
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Nick wrote]
<br>
<em>    &gt; &quot;Loss of consciousness&quot; implies something the observer would
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; notice. I'm confused.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, sorry, [Nick]. I would like to claim that a loss of consciousness
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed might pass unnoticed by the &quot;subject&quot; in this case. I should have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stated that.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, let's say that all of Monday except the last seven minutes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a genuine computation on some genuine computer, and that in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;executing Monday, the computer goes through N states per minute.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's further say that during the last seven minutes, each of the 7*N
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;states was not computed at all, but was loaded from completely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;random states somebody produced from a random number 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generator BUT JUST SO HAPPENED by sheer chance to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identical to the 7*N states that would have been computed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I claim
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) during those 7 minutes the subject, i.e. the person, was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not conscious (or alive)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) later he would have absolutely no way of knowing that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those 7 minutes were in any way different, unless he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learned about it indirectly some time later.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, to the person, it might just as well have been, I claim,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same as if he stopped being conscious at 23:23 on Monday,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then at 12:00:00 am on Tuesday morning had some memories
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those 7 minutes added, memories that would be identical to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the memories he would have obtained had he been calculated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole time.
<br>
<p>In short, the experience differs only by being vacuous at certain times.
<br>
Of course, the experiencer is unable to report on this state of affairs
<br>
any more than Humphrey Bogart can report on his entire lack of
<br>
experience whenever &quot;Casablanca&quot; is shown.  For there, just as
<br>
for the instant between Monday and Tuesay, Humphrey's state
<br>
from one instant to the next is not computed, just looked up.
<br>
<p>In your very appropriate terminology Monday = {Si...Sj} and
<br>
Tuesday = {Sm...Sn}, but while S(j-1)-&gt;Sj is characterized
<br>
by information flow, that's not true of Sj -&gt;Sm, unless either
<br>
j = m (as in one of your hypotheses), or somehow Sm really
<br>
is computed someway from Sj.
