<p>You can't simply *assume* that society will enforce prohibitions
<br>
against unethical actions. We're not just laying back and observing
<br>
the future- it's our job to *build* such a society, from the ground
<br>
up, starting with whatever we have now. You can't write a blueprint
<br>
for how to build such a society that starts off by assuming that such
<br>
a society has already been built. If you start off by assuming that
<br>
any unFriendly being is instantly vaporized, you're quite correct. The
<br>
question is, how do we get to the point where unFriendly beings are
<br>
vaporized (or at least prohibited from doing harm)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Show us examples of such derivations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Coming shortly (it's getting late).  Again, an excellent question!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Error, reference not found. There's no such thing as a computer &quot;with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; the intelligence of a human&quot;, because computers will have vastly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; different skillsets than humans do (see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/LOGI/seedAI.html">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/LOGI/seedAI.html</a>).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  :-)  You're being pedantic and difficult.  I'm arguing a general equivalence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  here, not a specific skill set.
</em><br>
<p>There's no such thing as general equivalence, without specific
<br>
equivalence in at least some cases; the general skillset is simply
<br>
some function of the union of all specific skillsets. To name a
<br>
specific example, there's no such thing as an animal that's
<br>
human-equivalent in sports, because the skillsets are too different.
<br>
Few animals could even hold a javelin, while no human can match the
<br>
brute strength of most animals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; The people on this list already have a great deal of human-universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; architecture, which AIs won't have. See
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; <a href="http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI//anthro.html">http://www.intelligence.org/upload/CFAI//anthro.html</a>,

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Yes, but I don't see why my argument cares whether or not the AGIs have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  human universal architecture (except that it is a good argument that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  testing on humans is insufficient for proof of behavior in AGIs)
</em><br>
<p>You can't explain something to someone in English unless they have a
<br>
great deal of human-universal architecture. English was *built* for
<br>
humans- you can't just give it to, say, a Boeing 767 and pray for the
<br>
instructions to work. We invented programming languages precisely
<br>
because computers can't parse English.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Any AI intelligent enough to actually understand all this will be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; than intelligent enough to rewrite itself and start a recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; self-improvement loop. See <a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/tom/?p=7">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/tom/?p=7</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Possibly true but it is probably not smart enough to get around the blocks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that humans will have placed in it's way (and the fact that humans will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  placed the goal that it is UnFriendly to attempt to do so until the humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  declare that it is ready).
</em><br>
<p>See <a href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/tom/?p=94">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/tom/?p=94</a> on how effective such
<br>
&quot;blocks&quot; are, even against other humans.
