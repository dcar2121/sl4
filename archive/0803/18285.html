</em><br>
<p>Hmmmm.  I'm used to expressing everything in units where Planck's
<br>
constant is 1, as well as the speed of light.  So any size has an
<br>
equivalent mass and vice versa.  However, what I was getting at is
<br>
that the size of something and its mass are in general two completely
<br>
different physical quantities, regardless of whether you measure them
<br>
both in terms of mass or both in terms of length.  Their relationship
<br>
depends on the density of the particles making them up.  However, upon
<br>
looking up the diameter of a proton, I realized that you're right in
<br>
this case... it *is* the same as the mass.  I was then going to say,
<br>
maybe this is just coincidence... but upon further thought I think I
<br>
see why they are the same.  For something like an atom, its size and
<br>
its mass are unrelated, because it's made up of particles which are
<br>
non-relativistic (most of their energy is stored in their rest mass).
<br>
However, for protons, it's made up of quarks which are relativistic
<br>
(most of their energy is stored in their kinetic energy).  So if most
<br>
of the proton's mass is due to the kinetic energy of the quarks, then
<br>
the average separation of the quarks is going to be related to the
<br>
total mass of the proton.  Tricky!  So you're right.  Strike my
<br>
comment about the mass and volume of the proton not being the same
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Anyway, maybe it's not interesting to you that a bit is the size of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  smallest stable particle, but it's interesting to me.  The entropy of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  universe puts an upper bound on the biggest memory you can build, independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of whatever particles the universe might contain.  It also suggests a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  relationship between the strong force and gravity.
</em><br>
<p>It's definitely not interesting.  I don't know what makes you say it's
<br>
the &quot;smallest particle&quot;, but I think it's unlikely that it's stable.
<br>
If any kind of Grand Unified Theory is true, than it's guaranteed to
<br>
decay into positrons eventually.  You can pack a lot of bits into a
<br>
femtometer, which is the size of a proton.  It would just  have to be
<br>
stored in stuff that is a lot smaller than protons (for instance, high
<br>
energy photons, gravitational waves, etc.)  In principle, you could
<br>
have an entire quantum computer the size of a proton, and have it
<br>
calculating all sorts of interesting things.  You just seem to be
<br>
proposing a limit that doesn't exist, by taking a limit for a large
<br>
volume and translating that into a limit for a small volume which just
<br>
gives you a totally wrong result... since the # of bits scales with
<br>
area and not volume.
