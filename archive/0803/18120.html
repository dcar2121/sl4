<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; electromagnetic storage constraints).  However, the bandwidth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; bringing data into your 'brain' can exceed the bandwidth to

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  At least.  And though we are just discussing principle, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  are the other senses that should be given passing mention.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assumed bandwidth covers the sum of all senses.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Right.  Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  second re-reading, I get it.  That is, for example, do I squint so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  that the incoming bandwidth isn't any greater than the bandwidth
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  restated and embroidered with &quot;That is...&quot;, or &quot;In other words...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or trying to skim written material IN ORDER TO notice

<em>&gt;&gt;  less of it----ah!  Thanks!  Yes I do.  Often, especially with pages

<em>&gt;&gt;  I already read or which seem overly redundant,  I have found,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  as per your prediction, that I can more accurately &quot;remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  what I perceive&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This goes to my point about how much memory is required or is even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  But still, if I take your question above quite literally, the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  still is no, I think. BTW, what has this to do with Memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Merging Possible for Close Duplicates?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that the answer should be no.  Along the same intention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximizing runtime should be maximizing resolution and bandwidth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is also a point to be made here for the idea that intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compression allows a larger volume of data to be written to memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the fixed-bandwidth channel.  That's a different topic though,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you're already asking what this line of thinking has to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the subject of close duplicates.
</em><br>
<p>The compression you speak of could be done as you say, before
<br>
it reaches memory (in our highly oversimplified language and model
<br>
we're using here), or maybe memory itself that does it (e.g. at a future
<br>
time).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What determines how close a duplicate is to the original?  Whether the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TE uses teleportation or computronium uploads, the principle measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of identity is ... what exactly?
</em><br>
<p>It is similarity of structure, ultimately.  Of course, we have various
<br>
measures of that (but we also have various yard-sticks that differ
<br>
one from the other a little, and even meter-sticks, but we firmly
<br>
believe in the utility of the 'length' concept, despite the dance of
<br>
atoms going on in physical objects).
<br>
<p>Suppose that by some *obvious* [1] isomorphism,  today Lee is
<br>
one bit string
<br>
<p>11011011001110010110111111001010110100000011...
<br>
and tomorrow I am
<br>
11011011001110010110011111001010110100000010...
<br>
<p>where two 0's happen to be changed to 1's.  By all measures
<br>
of similarity, those two strings are still very similar. (It would be
<br>
easy to mention some particular measures used by mathematicians,
<br>
but the ones I'm completely familiar with without having to go look
<br>
them up aren't very applicable here.)
<br>
<p>If the teleporter or copying machinery is working well, there will
<br>
be very few bit errors. I claim that the reality really is [Jef will
<br>
have a fit with that] that similarity of structure exists 100% for
<br>
all truly identical things (e.g. different carbon atoms in the same
<br>
QM state), and falls off directly as one thing starts less and less
<br>
to resemble another.  In other words, resemblance does *not*
<br>
lie strictly in the eye of the beholder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems that often it is memories that are used to determine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity up to the point of copy, and that instances diverge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from each other because of their new memories.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Or new experiences which create or destroy small parts
<br>
of the structure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the &quot;what is identity&quot; question is endemic to this &quot;Close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicates&quot; discussion but it quickly turns into a distracting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quagmire from which there is no return.  It seems there are others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here who believe memory is not the sole measure of identity, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives rise to a completely different view of what a close duplicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would mean.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, you're right.  Naturally, I think my views 100% sensible,
<br>
the views of many other worthies in the high 90's, and those who
<br>
believe that identity has nothing to do with memory in the low 10's.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I ask about the relationship between experience of an event and memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the event because it is relevant to how memory can be merged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without losing the ability to reconstruct the experience.  I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to start a separate thread to discuss what it means to believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a memory as experience, which (like the identity question) is relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but distracting.
</em><br>
<p>I'll do it!  Thanks for the suggestion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I argue that it should not cause cognitive dissonance to say, &quot;I went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the movies&quot; at the same time &quot;I went to the bookstore&quot; (to use your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original analogy) because both copies have a belief in their identity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as Me.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I don't quite agree with your &quot;because both copies have a belief
<br>
in their identity as Me&quot;.  To me, it's a fact of the matter, not a conviction.
<br>
Some people think they're Napoleon, but they're wrong.  Yet it would
<br>
be possible for a fantastic coincidence of molecular motions to produce
<br>
the actual Napoleon. (He might have a hard time proving that, at least
<br>
until he talked to enough historians and linguists!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also currently believe that each copy, for the duration that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each existed, was Me.
</em><br>
<p>So do I.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As long as I am not bound by a belief that my identity can only exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a linear series of experience, there is no problem with being several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simultaneous duplicates.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's two of us. Actually, there may be three or four here who agree
<br>
with us!  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is that a clearer statement of support for my original assessment that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close duplicates should merge at least as easily as they are created?
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how that last statement follows from anything above.
<br>
We may be having a terminological problem here. In principle,
<br>
nothing is easier than creating duplicates whose subsequent
<br>
experiences and memories diverge. In fact, they can merge
<br>
away from each other arbitrarily far, and become---to my way
<br>
of thinking---different people entirely.
<br>
<p>But how in the world to merge them?  What about temporal
<br>
conflicts, like &quot;Oh, man, am I confused!  I could swear I went
<br>
to the bookstore last night until it closed at 11pm. But I can
<br>
also swear I was watching &quot;The Incredibles&quot; from 9pm to
<br>
11pm.&quot;   Somehow we have to reconcile this in his brain.
<br>
And that's just an easy example. Much more difficult conflicts
<br>
can be described. So merging is vastly more difficult than
<br>
copy generation.

<p>[1]  A detailed bas-relief of the Mississippi Valley is &quot;isomorphic&quot;
<br>
to the real Mississippi Valley, where the scare quoted term doesn't 
<br>
have exactly the same meaning that it does in mathematics. Here
<br>
I'm using the term much as the way a mathematician might use
<br>
&quot;homomorphism&quot;. As for it being &quot;obvious&quot;, if people all died and
<br>
an alien came along, he *would* be able to stop the homomorphism.
<br>
He'd say &quot;Hmm, those entities were making a map of that valley
<br>
for some reason.&quot;
<br>
<p>Likewise, there is an easy &quot;isomorphism&quot; between the sentence
<br>
&quot;now is the time for all good men to...&quot;  and the string
<br>
<p>1415220009190020080500200913050006151800011212
<br>
000715150400130514002015...
<br>
<p>which people who like codes and ciphers will have no trouble
<br>
decrypting.  The same is true of a bit string representing a person.
<br>
Sooner or later a highly intelligent entity will spot whatever coding
<br>
scheme has been used to encode the person as bits.
