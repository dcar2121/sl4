</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The lookup is merely indexical.
</em><br>
<p>As you mention afterwards, this is a &quot;super extreme thought
<br>
experiment&quot; since it's not only practically impossible, but also
<br>
physically impossible even in principle.  Let's say you want to ask it
<br>
any question that can be fit into a 100 byte string.  (I could imagine
<br>
asking questions which take more than a line to type out, but let's
<br>
make the conservative assumption that every possible question fits
<br>
into a 1-line short string like this.)  That means there are 2^800
<br>
different possible questions you could ask it (let's ignore the issue
<br>
of whether all of the possible strings you could make correspond to
<br>
meaningful questions... if only 1 in a million correspond to a
<br>
meaningful question, then add a few more bytes to the length of the
<br>
allowed string to get up to the full 2^800 possibilities).
<br>
<p>Since there are 2^800 possible questions, it needs a lookup table that
<br>
is at least 2^800 bits long.  This is assuming every question has a
<br>
yes/no answer.  If they require freeform response, then you'd need an
<br>
even larger lookup table... something like 800^800 = 2^7715 bits if
<br>
the answers can be 100 bytes just like the questions.  However, the
<br>
total number of quantum bits in the entire universe is only 10^120 =
<br>
2^400 (from the Bekenstein bound).  This is the maximal amount of
<br>
information which can be stored in the entire universe.  2^7715 simply
<br>
won't fit!  Even if you believe the universe extends forever past the
<br>
cosmological horizon, it still doesn't help because there is an event
<br>
horizon about 16 billion light years away beyond which nothing will
<br>
ever be able to affect us so it cannot be used for computing.  So
<br>
we're stuck always with this 10^120 bit limitation... no global lookup
<br>
tables are allowed, even if you are only interested in yes/no
<br>
questions limitted to 100 bytes in length.
