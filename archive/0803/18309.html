AGI projects that they *thought* were &quot;proto-AGI&quot; over the years. It

seems to me that people need to re-calibrate their model of what

government can discern with respect to AGI.
<br>
<p>Describe, in very strict terms, how a proto-AGI is discernible from  
<br>
parlor-trick AGI.  What scientific measure can we use to categorize  
<br>
the two?

<p><p><em>&gt;  For example, DARPA will often begin long-horizon, low probability

<p><p><em>&gt;  From a strategic POV, I think that what we need to do is make the

<p><p>This bit of pablum is delusional and mostly stupid, sorry.  Not just  
<br>
on one point, but several points, mostly because it lacks an

intersection with reality.
<br>
<p>I think it is safe to say that this line of reasoning has no business

on the SL4 list, mostly because it is more platitude than &quot;reasoning&quot;.
