<em>&gt; Question: would you consider that a given program had passed

<em>&gt; the Turing Test under these conditions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A. All Earth's six hundred million English speaking people interact
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      by teletype with it, some specialist computer folks up to several
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      thousand interactions each.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B.  Each interaction consists of a question to the program/human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      of less than 10,000 characters.  The reply of the program (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      human, the interviewer does not know) is always of about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      the same length and complexity of that of the question, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      around 10^4 characters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; C. Each interviewer is convinced that as of 2008, the entity typing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      back responses must be a human being.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My guess is that your answer would be &quot;yes, if it is a program then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has passed the Turing Test&quot;, and that, moreover, the remote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity (whether human or not) was conscious and had internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, what if it is revealed to you than an Alien intelligence had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deposited this program/machine in the possession of an Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person collaborator, and that the computronium based machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was merely doing a table lookup on all the possible 26^10000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible keyboard inputs?  In other words, the Alien had somehow,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps by making untold trillions of copies of himself, had personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answered all possible 10,000 character questions, and then had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just left the device to parrot his responses?  You think it's still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious?
</em><br>
<p>Suppose you have a 3 way Turing test between a human, a GLUT, and a human
<br>
whose memory is set to read-only at the start of the test (or equivalently,
<br>
whose mental state is reset after each question).  Is the read-only human
<br>
conscious?
