</em><br>
<p><p>To put it simply, it is a Red Queen's Race, and for a variety of  
<br>
technical reasons no one is likely to catch you after a certain point  
<br>
is crossed in development that should occur pretty early on and/or  
<br>
under the noise floor of notice.  The curious thing is that in an  
<br>
effectively closed system this has a high probability of being true  
<br>
for a very broad range of takeoff speeds.  Whether it takes a day or a  
<br>
year, any interdiction will likely show up too late though for  
<br>
slightly different predominant reasons.  It should be obvious with  
<br>
some consideration, being a mixture of complexity scaling, cognitive  
<br>
biases, and latency.  It is not a *certainty*, just probable.  Even if  
<br>
they are copying an immature system, they inherit its scaling  
<br>
characteristics but any time delay imposed by implementation or  
<br>
improvement imposes extreme costs with respect to catching the  
<br>
original system in terms of intelligence, such that throwing hardware  
<br>
at the problem faster may not significantly help.
<br>
<p>Given the current landscape, I find it improbable that anyone will be  
<br>
paying close attention until well after the critical point where  
<br>
another competitor can enter the race with any probability of  
<br>
success.  By the time they try to steal your AI, they will not be able  
<br>
to unless you expended considerable effort to make it a possibility.
