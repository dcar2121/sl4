Slawek writes

<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, this person in California would definitely &quot;feel like Slawek&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; but why should &quot;someone who feels like X&quot; imply &quot;someone is X&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Because he accumulates additional experience just as the original
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Slawek did.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry Lee, but this is not the *kind* of answer I'm looking for. All the answers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've received so far from you and other people already assume that memories are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important whereas the original question is still why are memories important in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first place, and not just to survival, but why are they so important, period.
</em><br>
<p>What in the world does that mean?  How can something be important
<br>
in the abstract without being important to someone, or for something?
<br>
<p>And *survival* is what is important in these arguments.  You do wish
<br>
to survive, I take it, and you can readily understand why survival is
<br>
so important for people.  You know, people who are afraid to 
<br>
teleport, for example, are merely afraid that they won't survive the
<br>
trip.  Quite reasonable, actually, to worry this way.
<br>
<p>But maybe survival isn't important to you, if it's still the case that you
<br>
wouldn't permit the use of a general anesthetic on your person. Or
<br>
else you would, but claim that you wouldn't survive the treatment. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thank  you, though, for trying and I encourage you to keep trying.
</em><br>
<p>Surely. No problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Consider:  after you've been an hour in California
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; getting used to Lee's body and Lee's circumstances, then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; transfer your memories to Stuart's body in Vienna for that period
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of time. (Yes... please!  I know I'm assuming that &quot;you&quot; are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; transferred, but hear me out.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; When it's all over, and you're back in Slawek's own house in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the old familiar body, you would have no doubt that you had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; traveled to California and then to Vienna.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Now if you want to say, &quot;Oh, well, that wasn't me in California,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it was someone else&quot;, then answer me this: if you weren't in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; California during that hour, where were you while all this happened?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, I can answer this in detail, but let me just say that I'm not interested in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debating whether you or I am right about this. This would not be productive at this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage. We won't be ready to do that until you can answer why memories are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important....
</em><br>
<p>Hopefully, I successfully criticized what you seem to mean by
<br>
&quot;important&quot; and also explained that survival is what is at issue
<br>
for most of us in these discussions.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Right now, and just for fun only, I can give you an outline of what that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer would look like, but hope you leave it alone, at least for now. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From my perspective, (what I define as) &quot;I&quot; (different from what you mean by &quot;I&quot;) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never went anywhere. I never left my house even though I remember now having an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience of being in California and Vienna in other bodies. I only remember this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but have not experienced being in California or Vienna.  What I actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced was a replacement of Slawek-type memories with Lee-type memories and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then replacement of Lee-type memories with updated Slawek-type memories that were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty cool. You see, my &quot;I&quot; is not attached to any type of personal memories. 
</em><br>
<p>Er, sorry, can't resist.  So you *are* attached to your atoms!  Was JC right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While personal memories are fun and precious, they do not define what I am (notice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;what&quot; instead of &quot;who&quot;) so they are expendable. I would compare Slawek-type 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories that currently occupy my brain to a role I'm currently acting out or to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunch of clothes I'm used to wearing. I can act out different roles in different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clothes without affecting my existence in any way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
