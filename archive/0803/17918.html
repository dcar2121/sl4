<p>
On the whole question of whether your duplicate is really you or not,
<br>
one thing seems to have been missed: there is more to who you are than
<br>
just your memories.
<br>
<p>If you are duplicated ten times, the most likely outcome is that you
<br>
will lose your partner, your house, your parents, your job, most of
<br>
your possessions, 9/10s of your cash, and most of your friends - all
<br>
in one short instant.
<br>
<p>This should count as a very traumatic experience. One that will
<br>
definitely affect your subjective experience - but it is precisely the
<br>
similarity in subjective experience that seems to be the main argument
<br>
for claiming you and your duplicates are the same.
<br>
<p>The more your are socially embedded in the world, the more convincing
<br>
the argument becomes that you are not duplicating &quot;you&quot;, but creating
<br>
two new beings.
<br>
<p>Of course, there are other legal issues with duplication - do you need
<br>
to follow a previously signed contract, for example? This is not just
<br>
a gratuitous example; our whole social, legal and financial system is
<br>
based around some sort of continuity of responsibility (if I killed
<br>
someone a year ago, that still counts as me). This passing on of
<br>
responsibility keeps us pretty consistent; if nothing we did would be
<br>
criticised or praised in a week's time, our behaviour would be far
<br>
more erratic, and we would be a &quot;different person&quot; from day to day.
<br>
<p>So the issue of how much legal, environmental and social continuity
<br>
there is upon duplication will be important to deciding if a duplicate
<br>
is the same person as the original.
<br>
<p>Somewhat trivial example: unable to decide between a career in acting
<br>
or in tax accounting, you duplicate yourself and each copy takes a
<br>
different path. Immediately after duplication you are told &quot;you're the
<br>
actor!&quot; or &quot;you're the tax accountant!&quot;. After ten seconds to let that
<br>
sink in, I'd say that you're already two different people.
<br>
