<em>&gt;&gt;  configuration of Tuesday arises by chance, say, (or from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  record of a previous execution), then there is only an infinitesimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  loss of consciousness:  namely, the instant between Monday and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Tuesday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Loss of consciousness&quot; implies something the observer would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notice. I'm confused.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, sorry. I would like to claim that a loss of consciousness indeed
<br>
might pass unnoticed by the &quot;subject&quot; in this case. I should have
<br>
stated that.
<br>
<p>For example, let's say that all of Monday except the last seven minutes
<br>
is a genuine computation on some genuine computer, and that in
<br>
executing Monday, the computer goes through N states per minute.
<br>
Let's further say that during the last seven minutes, each of the 7*N
<br>
states was not computed at all, but was loaded from completely
<br>
random states somebody produced from a random number 
<br>
generator BUT JUST SO HAPPENED by sheer chance to be
<br>
identical to the 7*N states that would have been computed.
<br>
<p>Then I claim
<br>
<p>(1) during those 7 minutes the subject, i.e. the person, was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not conscious (or alive)
<br>
(2) later he would have absolutely no way of knowing that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those 7 minutes were in any way different, unless he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;learned about it indirectly some time later.
<br>
<p>For, to the person, it might just as well have been, I claim,
<br>
the same as if he stopped being conscious at 23:23 on Monday,
<br>
and then at 12:00:00 am on Tuesday morning had some memories
<br>
of those 7 minutes added, memories that would be identical to
<br>
the memories he would have obtained had he been calculated
<br>
the whole time.
