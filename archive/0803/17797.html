<p><em>&gt; The decimal expansion of pi looks random but contains any string of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digits you care to nominate....it contains islands of structure hidden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the noise. If these islands of structure contain observers, they will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be no less conscious for the fact that an observer outside the ensemble
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't find them.
</em><br>
<p>I do not believe that pi (or more precisely an entirely random sequence)
<br>
is more conscious, and has more conscious observers, than the entire
<br>
human race on Earth in the year 2008.
<br>
<p>But to your way of thinking, must not an infinitely long random sequence,
<br>
similar to pi in many ways, contain stretches isomorphic to anyone's life,
<br>
isomorphic to all the thoughts humans have ever had or ever can have? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Don't want to be picky, but how long is a &quot;moment&quot;?  For me, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  there is no information flow, there cannot be consciousness. &lt;sigh&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I admit that by &quot;information flow&quot; I'm subscribing to a belief in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the importance of time as a basic physical reality---I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  bought into Barbour's views or any of that. It's all too theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and unsure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seemed to agree earlier on that there wouldn't be a problem if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moments lasted a day.
</em><br>
<p>That's right.  A lot of information can flow, causally, in a day,
<br>
or even in a second. No information flows between the dust
<br>
between the galaxies that is isomorphic to the thoughts of a
<br>
conscioius creature. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if they occurred in separate Hubble volumes (as indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they must, purely by chance, if the universe is infinite) with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of information flow between them you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience Monday followed by Tuesday.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but only if (to my way of thinking) there was any information
<br>
flow going on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If every computation is necessarily implemented by virtue of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; status as a platonic object then there is no basis for saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is a separate &quot;real&quot; universe.
</em><br>
<p>Right. That's the main reason that I don't subscribe to &quot;platonic&quot;
<br>
computation. That is, real computation---any computation worthy
<br>
of the name---must be driven by causality in which each state is
<br>
causally derived from earlier state(s).  I don't believe in timeless
<br>
computation, calculation, or consciousness.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead, what you think of and everyone has always thought of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the real universe is a subset of a wider mathematical reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your living in a world with orderly physical laws would then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be explained probabilistically as following the computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paths of highest measure....
