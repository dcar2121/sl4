<em>&gt; Prove your statement by freeing me of the meme or making me willingly perform an unethical act.
</em><br>
<p>One can make the argument that you are being unethical just by
<br>
existing, and consumming at the level you (and I) do. One can make the
<br>
argument that by not being out in the streets, not protesting against
<br>
your government, or by the way you voted/didn't vote, you are being
<br>
profoundly unethical. One can make the argument that by not investing
<br>
your time/money entirely in the thrid world, you are being unethically
<br>
(or one can make the reverse argument, of course).
<br>
<p>I don't want to deny your experiment - which sounds worthy and
<br>
gratifying - but you just seem to be finding the best way for you,
<br>
personally, to live in a friendly way with your immediate suroundings.
<br>
Which is great, but not what we'd want of an AI.
<br>
<p>Would you want a politician to behave the way you do? Yes, probably,
<br>
but that is not the main thing we want from a politician - the
<br>
crucial, most important thing is their policies, not their morales.
<br>
And policies often must do harm to someone (generally to benefit
<br>
someone else). But the details of who is harmed, why, for what reason,
<br>
and to benefit whom, are all ethical and moral decisions that must be
<br>
framed within specific moral systems - concepts your everyday
<br>
definition of friendliness fails to capture.
<br>
<p>Similarly, would you want a general to have your moral position? (a
<br>
general in an &quot;acceptable&quot; war - western allies WWII, for example). A
<br>
dominant AI will be much closer to a general or a politician than it
<br>
would be to you or me.
<br>
<p>Anyway, keep up the experiment, but I feel it has unfortunately little
<br>
relevance to AI's as such,
<br>
<p>Stuart
