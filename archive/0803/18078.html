<p>Do you think it’s important that the copy of your message that I am
<br>
reading is *like* the one you typed on your computer?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; concept of &quot;survival&quot; cannot be used in the explanation.

<p>Something of the John Clark of 10 seconds ago still exists right now;
<br>
I’d like the same thing will be true 10 seconds from now. I feel no
<br>
obligation to explain why I’d like this to happen, and in fact you may
<br>
feel differently and prefer oblivion. There is no disputing matters of
<br>
taste.

<p><em>&gt; When Ronald Reagan died, nobody questioned it was Ronald Reagan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who died [….] cable news stations have shown 3-4-hour live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coverage from his funeral 
</em><br>
<p>It was certainly the conventional viewpoint that Ronald Reagan died when
<br>
his heart stopped beating, but I’ll let you in on a little secret, even
<br>
Fox news can be wrong. I think he died about 10 years before that.
