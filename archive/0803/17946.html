<p>
Dear all,
<br>
<p>I've recently finished a paper on a possible method for designing the
<br>
moral system of a developing AI. The paper is at
<br>
<a href="http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf">http://www.neweuropeancentury.org/GodAI.pdf</a> , and it too long to copy
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>People recomended that I put it on this list, and beg for comments on
<br>
it. Any such comments are most welcome, including recursive comments
<br>
(i.e. comments on where to go to get people's comments). Especially
<br>
needed would be advice to put in section 7, which lists the ways in
<br>
which the paper could be wrong.
<br>
<p>The basic assumptions are: self improving AI is possible. These
<br>
machines will be far beyond what we can imagine, and will have a basic
<br>
understanding of humans and human language.
<br>
<p>The paper argues that simple solutions, such as a single wish, or even
<br>
a more complicated coherent extrapolated volition goal, will not be
<br>
enough to build a friendly AI.
<br>
<p>The entire idea of limited humans guiding a supremely intelligent AI
<br>
(a GodAI, to use the term in the paper) seems ridiculous.
<br>
Nevertheless, the paper argues that it can be done. The
<br>
trustworthiness of the AI will be checked at each step by the AI
<br>
itself, and a &quot;chain&quot; of gradually lesser intelligences stretching
<br>
back down to us.
<br>
<p>The interactions between the GodAI and humans will be very
<br>
complicated, but will mainly consist of the GodAI figuring out the
<br>
likely consequences of particular moral systems, and humans figuring
<br>
out whether this is an acceptable result. This plays to the lack of
<br>
symmetry of human cognitive abilities: our complete cluelessness at
<br>
predicting the consequences of certain decisions, but our skill at
<br>
judging whether the consequences are sound. The GodAI will complement
<br>
our deficiencies, and, with open and imaginative minds, we can guide
<br>
its goals.
<br>
<p>The procedure does not fail catastrophically if the intelligence of
<br>
the top AI turns out to be limited; in fact, it is rather suited to
<br>
such an eventuality. It is also robust.
<br>
<p>The procedure is, however, both political and imperfect: political
<br>
because the end result will depend on decisions made my humans along
<br>
the way, and on the manner in which these decisions are made, and
<br>
imperfect because the aim is not to find the single most ideal
<br>
solution, but just a suitably great one (and, not incidentally, a
<br>
non-lethal one).
<br>
<p>Many thanks,
<br>
Stuart
