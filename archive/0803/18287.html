</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why would they do it secretly?
</em><br>
<p>If someone is manifestly on the right track to AI, I can see the
<br>
military mind treating it the same way as nuclear technology, keeping
<br>
it as secret as possible to gain an edge and avoid its use by
<br>
terrorists/unfriendly states. That might mean appropriating it, then
<br>
quietly quashing the research trying to make it appear as another
<br>
failed attempt in the litany of AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Far and fast is my argument so that any one persons mistake is

<em>&gt; Do you understand the failure modes, as it would appear from your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  perspective, of democracy and markets when you inject gross
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  disparities of intelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure of the exact failure modes you are referring to
<br>
(Economics 2.0 of accelerando origin?). As I see it there are no
<br>
likely* pure success models for when humanity understands
<br>
intelligence. So the least worst situation is where the maximum amount
<br>
of humanity possible leaves some imprint of its existence on the
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>Humanity losing &quot;control&quot; and stopping being the top dog is pretty
<br>
much a given. But perhaps we can do as well as the bacteria and be 90%
<br>
of the individuals that make up the higher order life form that will
<br>
be created. Most likely not in our current bodies, unless non-bio nano
<br>
tech is nigh impossible.

<p>* I don't consider friendly AI at all likely (theoretically or
<br>
practically), so I have to consider contingencies.
