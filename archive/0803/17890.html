<p>
I propose the following formal measure of subjective experience.  The
<br>
experience of an agent observing event X is K(S2|S1) where S1 is the state of
<br>
the agent before observing X, S2 is the state afterwards, and K is Kolmogorov
<br>
complexity.  In other words, the subjective experience is measured by the
<br>
length of the shortest program that inputs a description of S1 and outputs a
<br>
description of S2.
<br>
<p>Motivation.
<br>
<p>Humans are said to have subjective experience, meaning that:
<br>
<p>1. You can recall that X happened (episodic memory).
<br>
2. After observing X, you assign a higher probability of observing X again in
<br>
the same context (procedural memory).
<br>
3. If X has nonzero utility, you change your behavior to increase your
<br>
utility, to seek or avoid X (reinforcement learning).
<br>
<p>All of these result in a change in mental state.  On the other hand, if you
<br>
were unconscious or someplace else when X happened, then none of these changes
<br>
would have taken place.
<br>
<p>The existence of subjective experience has not been proven.  For example, a
<br>
philosophical zombie is claimed to have no subjective experience but otherwise
<br>
behave identically to a human (e.g. say &quot;ouch&quot; but not feel pain).  However a
<br>
rationalist would reject this view because there is no test to distinguish a
<br>
zombie from a human.
<br>
<p>Assume humans have subjective experience.  This experience must occur in the
<br>
brain.  If you put a brain in a vat and stimulated its sensory nerves, it
<br>
would experience a sensation.  If you replaced the neurons one at a time with
<br>
equivalent functional devices (Chalmers' fading qualia argument), then there
<br>
would be no change in behavior and presumably no loss of subjective
<br>
experience.  If you replaced the brain with any equivalent Turing machine
<br>
(implementing the same function), then it must have subjective experience.  If
<br>
we assume further that there are things that don't have subjective experience
<br>
(for example, rocks or dead humans), then subjective experience must be a
<br>
nontrivial property of Turing machines.
<br>
<p>Conditional Kolmogorov complexity is therefore one possible measure.  As
<br>
further motivation, consider experiencing two events, X and Y.  This will
<br>
result in more to be recalled (greater complexity with respect to episodic
<br>
memory), greater adjustment of probability (procedural memory) and greater
<br>
change in behavior (reinforcement).
<br>
<p>Applications.
<br>
<p>Some people believe that it is unethical to harm (kill or decrease utility of)
<br>
agents that have subjective experience.  I do not take a position on this
<br>
issue, but if we assume it is true, then:
<br>
<p>- Teleportation (making a copy of a person and destroying the original) is
<br>
ethical because K(S2|S1) = 0 (no change in mental state).
<br>
<p>- Torture followed by reprogramming the brain to erase the memory of it is
<br>
ethical for the same reason.
<br>
<p>- Killing animals to save humans is ethical because humans have bigger brains,
<br>
and therefore a greater capacity for subjective experience.  (One could argue
<br>
that killing humans for the benefit of superhuman intelligence is ethical for
<br>
the same reason).
<br>
<p>- There is no subjective experience of death because K({}|S1) = 0.
<br>
<p>However, this ethical view also leads to the conclusion:
<br>
<p>- Creating and then killing a person regardless of what happens in between is
<br>
ethical because K({}|{}) = 0.  (But one could argue that killing is unethical
<br>
because of its negative utility on survivors).
<br>
<p>A data compression program like zip has subjective experience in all 3 modes
<br>
that humans do.  A compressor accepts a sequence of symbols from an unknown
<br>
source and has the task of predicting future symbols so that it can assign
<br>
shorter codes to the most likely symbols.  It has procedural memory because
<br>
after each event (observing symbol X in some context), it raises the
<br>
probability that X will occur next time the same context is observed.  It has
<br>
episodic memory because decompression recalls the exact sequence of events. 
<br>
It undergoes reinforcement learning with a utility function equal to the
<br>
negative of the length of the compressed output.  So even if you accept that
<br>
only one mode of learning is required for subjective experience (say, episodic
<br>
memory), then you have to conclude that if humans have subjective experience
<br>
then so do data compression programs.
<br>
<p>The human brain has a capacity for subjective experience K(S2|{}) from birth
<br>
between 10^9 bits (Landauer's estimate of long term memory, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.merkle.com/humanMemory.html">http://www.merkle.com/humanMemory.html</a> ), and 10^15 bits (the number of
<br>
synapses).  A data compression program together with its output could
<br>
therefore have as much subjective experience as an adult human from birth if
<br>
its input is large enough.
