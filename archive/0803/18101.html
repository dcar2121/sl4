<p><em>&gt; Exactly.  I think the only reason John Clark and Vladimir Nesov are

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  While they can come up with whatever bizarre definition for identity

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I agree that personal identity is a subjective concept, and this is
<br>
the reason for the &quot;paradoxes&quot; in thought experiments involving
<br>
duplication. However, we are stuck with the brains that we have
<br>
evolved with, and the idea that there can only be one version of us
<br>
persisting through time determines our concept of survival and
<br>
subjective anticipation.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;objective anticipation&quot;. Suppose you
<br>
have the choice of either being given a million dollars, or having 10
<br>
copies of yourself made who will then have their memories wiped and
<br>
each given a million dollars. Subjectively, I would like to be given
<br>
the million dollars. Objectively, my copies will prosper if I choose
<br>
the second option, but I don't care because I won't be able to
<br>
anticipate enjoying any of that money. Moreover, I wouldn't choose to
<br>
alter my sense of personal identity and anticipation so that I prefer
<br>
the second option, even though evolution would favour individuals that
<br>
did.
