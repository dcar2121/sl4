<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Thank-you for following the thought experiment so closely so far.

<em>&gt; &gt; However, I think I have made an error by writing &quot;there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; definitely be a causal link&quot; above. In the extreme case, the operator
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; saying which of these is the right one to implement the computation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Does that count as a causal link on the run in which this occurs? As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; far as you can tell by observing him, the operator is no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; knowledgeable than an ignorant person trying out every possible state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Could the computation possibly divine his mental state in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; decide whether there is a causal link and thereby become conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naturally, I don't see it as the computation getting access to his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  mental state, or anything like that. It's perhaps a bit like the operator
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  supposedly transferring quantities of Argon by gas canister into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a target receptacle but sometimes transfers Krypton either by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  accident or design. The delicate mass of the target will be affected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  without any access to his intentions, etc. (Sorry for the crude analogy, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  hope it doesn't have problems, and I hope I am not belating the obvious.)
</em><br>
<p>But the mass of the target will be affected in the same way whether or
<br>
not the operator transferring the gas canisters (which we can suppose
<br>
to be a means of transferring information) is aware of what he is
<br>
doing. An ignorant operator may happen upon the right Ar/Kr sequence
<br>
by chance, or by trying out every possible combination. If I have
<br>
understood you correctly that would mean no computation is
<br>
implemented. You have also said, I think, that if a knowledgeable
<br>
operator transfers the right information on some occasions then on
<br>
those occasions the computation is implemented; but how does the
<br>
computation know whether he is knowledgeable or ignorant if he keeps
<br>
it to himself?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Maybe I've got the wrong picture of what you are describing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Does the following implement your TE in more slightly more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  concrete terms?  The 6*7 = 42 computation is carried out in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Australia by someone with a pocket calculator. The M2/M3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is carried out by the calculator reaching all but the last step
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of the calculation, when the machine is destroyed but a nimble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  operator manages to record the semifinal state on a diskette and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  sends it to Vienna. A child in Vienna happens to receive this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  diskette, transfers the state to his own calculator, and finishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it, getting the answer 42.  But on some cases the operator sends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  a faulty semifinal diskette, and then either by luck the answer 42
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is obtained, or else, say, 58 is obtained. You direct our attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to the case where by luck 42 is obtained anyway, despite the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;noisy channel&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Either actual information flows, or it doesn't, i.e., the channel is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  noisy or it's not. The ignorant person trying out &quot;every possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  state&quot; means what? I apologize for not being able to correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  visualize what you mean here---it's probably quite clear but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  can't see it. Maybe the child in Vienna tries out a huge ensemble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  of diskettes one by one, and every so often one of them happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  by sheer chance to be identical to the proper diskette produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in Australia?
</em><br>
<p>Yes: under what circumstances do you think the computation is
<br>
implemented? For example, if the child in Vienna gets two diskettes,
<br>
knowing that one of them is the correct one, and tries them out both
<br>
does that mean the computation will definitely be implemented on one
<br>
run?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  On the other hand, I doubt that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  any insoluble problem with mine---just a bit of awkwardness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  e.g., why is a 3+1 dimensional creature conscious, a 2+1 dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  creature conscious (as in Flatland or the Life Board), but a 3 dimensional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  frozen block that is *completely* isomorphic to the 2+1 structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  not conscious?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; How can you be so sure about that last point?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; About assuming the complete isomorphism? What do you mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  You could easily have an ordinary 3D sculpture totally isomorphic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to a 2D run through time.  I used to suggest to people that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  visualize a stack of very thin gels, each recording the state of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Life Board. Piled on top of each other, they depict with 100%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  fidelity a Life Board computation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but how can you be sure that the pile of Life Boards doesn't
<br>
implement consciousness given that the corresponding time-varying Life
<br>
Board does?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; If a rock emulates anything then blowing it up isn't going to make any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; difference, since the point is that it doesn't matter what the rock's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; atoms are doing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Touche.  All right, then suppose I have a choice between (a) somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  magically removing from the universe---and causing to entirely cease to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  exist---a 400 kilogram of Stathis, or blowing your present biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  incarnation to smithereens.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this will no doubt make it seem even more absurd to you but
<br>
removing the rock from the universe won't make any difference either.
<br>
This is because if an amount of matter can map onto any computation,
<br>
then a smaller amount of matter can map onto the same computation in
<br>
multiple parallel processes. In the ultimate extrapolation of this
<br>
idea a simulation of the entire universe maps onto the null state.
<br>
This would mean that there is no separate physical reality, but what
<br>
we think of as physical reality is a simulation on the big Universal
<br>
Machine in Platonia. Thus, physical reality is put on the same
<br>
ontological basis as the natural numbers. No need for God, or for
<br>
asking why there is something rather than nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; On the other hand, if you blow up the physical Stathis, that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; mean that at least some branches of the computations in Platonia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; simulating me come to an abrupt end.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I'm sure you don't weigh 400kg, so let's say that you weigh
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  100kg. In comparison to the biological 100kg Stathis, how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;computation of Stathis&quot;, if I may ask, does a 100kg marble
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  statue of you emulate?  Or, in other words, right now your 100kg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  because it's ordinary matter at about 295 degrees Kelvin, already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  emulates you to some degree.  What degree?
</em><br>
<p>There isn't a separate physical me. The physical me is a simulation,
<br>
and blowing up the physical me means the computations in Platonia
<br>
underpinning me come to an end; whereas blowing up a statue of me does
<br>
not affect the computations relating to my consciousness.
