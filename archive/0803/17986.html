The threads here have been far too much to fully keep up with
<br>
lately, but I had to respond to this one. Legal responsible person
<br>
hood is a different matter from being a person. There are people
<br>
with Alzheimer's who do not form new memories, but otherwise are
<br>
functional enough that you wouldn't know they had it. I once ran
<br>
into this, a neighbor of my grand mothers looking for his car,
<br>
it had been gone for months but he expected it to be there. We had
<br>
him over for dinner, I'm quite certain that other than not forming
<br>
new long term memories of the dinner, his experience of it was not 
<br>
much different than anyone elses.
<br>
<p>In the end all our of memories go when we die, and generally fade away 
<br>
well before we die. Losing memories in minutes rather than years is
<br>
just a different time scale. But the experience of being alive and
<br>
being a person is very much there even if forgotten quite quickly.
<br>
<p>I have to argue memory is not what makes us human. Although it is
<br>
required to carry out the legal responsibilities of an adult. All
<br>
all of us really have for sure is right now, a bus hitting me 10 minutes
<br>
from now doesn't invalidate this moment.
