Stathis writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not a fallacy to speak of a star's centre, as long as the term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has some definition that we can all agree on.
</em><br>
<p>In the swirling dance of gluons and quarks, you're not going
<br>
to be able to give any pristine definition of &quot;centre&quot; (or &quot;center&quot;
<br>
as we write on this side of the oceans).
<br>
<p>That's just one problem with these rotten Aristotelian &quot;definitions&quot;
<br>
and why I cannot recall ever seeing any progress made in a 
<br>
discussion by someone trying to define something.  If your
<br>
interlocutor doesn't understand a certain term, re-phrase or
<br>
look for synonyms. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is wrong is to ascribe special significance to the centre,
</em><br>
<p>It is sometimes useful in some models of the solar system; don't
<br>
completely give it short shrift.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as if this had some basis in physics rather than being a cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peculiarity. An alien civilisation might reference everything to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the points where the star's axis of rotation cuts a surface where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the density is...
</em><br>
<p>Well, we're all free---and in physics even encouraged---to use
<br>
different and various coordinate systems. Even using different
<br>
coordinate systems (or, God forbid, different &quot;definitions&quot;) we
<br>
are still referring to the same reality out there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; exactly one seventh that of water at 56.356 degrees Celsius.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They understand what you mean by &quot;centre&quot; but are mystified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to why you find it special.  Are you going to tell them that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're idiots?
</em><br>
<p>Has it ever occurred to them that they can approximate the
<br>
entire trajectory of a moving body by assuming its mass is
<br>
concentrated at one point?  Answer me that, and I'll tell
<br>
you whether or not they're idiots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;             Of course [continues my parody of Stathis], we understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;             how people and astronomers came to this faulty conclusion;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;             [of thinking that there are such things as stars]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;             it's just that having that sort of mindset was conducive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;             the survival of the &quot;star-meme&quot;, a reification that enables
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;             it to spread easily from &quot;mind&quot; to &quot;mind&quot;, and helps
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;             astronomers gain more information about what's out there.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Not exactly. We know that humans have come to &quot;naturally&quot; delineate a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; star from the surrounding space and matter because of the way their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds and sense organs have evolved to detect electromagnetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radiation, for example.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aliens might consider the whole galaxy as close to a homogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole, with variations in temperature and clumpiness only of interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a scientist or a pedant.
</em><br>
<p>Do they have scientists?  Do their instruments reach all the way down
<br>
to the tiny size of stars? (No sarcasm; they may be gigantic beings.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How would you explain to these aliens that they've got it wrong?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where is their empirical or logical error.
</em><br>
<p>Their empirical error is an apparent inability to detect drastic changes
<br>
in density over stellar scales. For all I know, we might be making the
<br>
same &quot;empirical error&quot; about quarks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Stathis---the real one, again---agrees:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; Strictly speaking, yes; why should I care about some guy that wakes up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; in my bed tomorrow morning and thinks he's me? Why should I care about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; him even if he *does* have a lot in common with me and will tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; further my projects? Since I know I won't be around anyway, making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; plans beyond the next second is just evolution's ploy to help propagate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; a certain set of genes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Well, as soon as you are uploaded, you can take care of that, Stathis!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  You can reprogram yourself so that you won't make plans for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  future, so long, say, as you can contribute money or something to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  see to it that your projects continue to be worked on. Oh, you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;want&quot; to?  (Actually, I wonder &quot;who&quot; this &quot;you&quot; is who's saying this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  right now.) But please see below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; In fact, so is having any sort of goal or feeling. But the point is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; understanding all this does not make me want to reprogram my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; brain so that I am free of it... since that too would be contrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; to my programming. I'm a kind of willing slave.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Don't give up so easily!  You can free yourself from your slavery!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Just give the AI who awakens you from cryonic suspension,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or who oversees your uploading, explicit instructions to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  those changes that you won't have the will power to do yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Do you want to be a &quot;willing slave&quot; forever?  Besides, there must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  be other words for slaves who want to remain slaves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't want to die, and because I don't want to die, I don't want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do anything that will make me suicidal, such as modifying my own mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or allowing someone else to do it. I know beyond any doubt that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to live (which incorporates beliefs about personal identity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what counts as survival) is just something that evolution has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed into me, and that there is no objective basis to it.
</em><br>
<p>I'm a bit surprised that you, as a nominalist, even find the concept of
<br>
&quot;objective basis&quot; useful. But I believe selves to essentially be as real
<br>
as stars, or as real as democracy.  All of these can be deconstructed,
<br>
of course, as you and some others here have shown. One can even
<br>
take split-brain patients, and so on. Their case is especially interesting
<br>
because they'll dissemble for the sake of the unity of their selves.
<br>
<p>But when it comes down to it, it is just sophomoric to deny that you
<br>
are the same person from moment to moment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a person claims that 2+2=5 he is wrong, and if a person claims that lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is denser than gold he is wrong; but if a person declares that he no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer wishes to live he is *not* wrong, but simply stating a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predilection which happens to be contrary to the usual evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programming.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But understanding all this as I do, I
</em><br>
<p>which &quot;I&quot; ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *still* would resist anything that would make me suicidal. Moreover,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't in the slightest regret the fact that I am trapped in this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what I mean by &quot;willing slave&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>But that particular &quot;slave&quot; you refer to is just as illusory to your way
<br>
of thinking as your self is, isn't it?
