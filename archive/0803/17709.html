I also agree that there are significant risks with the open-source approach. 
<br>
<p>I think that some of those risks can be partially reduced by having a well-resourced, Safe-AI team building a closed-source AGI alongside improvements to the OpenCog model (eg. Novamente). IOW, keep the good guys &quot;on top of the code&quot;.
<br>
<p>Here are some other positive/neutral considerations:
<br>
<p>- If done well, the OpenCog project can also help to spread the concept of Safe-AI among AGI researchers.
<br>
<p>- The most gifted and prolific contributors could potentially be later incorporated into the parallel, closed-source, Safe-AGI team (eg. Novamente).
<br>
<p>- Even if we didn't launch OpenCog, some other team in the future could launch their own open-source project. Perhaps it's better to capture interest early in a project that's specifically focused on safety (ie. corner the &quot;market&quot;).
<br>
<p>- Potential Safe-AI donors/investors can see some tangible evidence (actual code) that AGI may be coming soon.
<br>
<p>- Going open-source would somewhat reduce the probability of enforced relinquishment. The cat is out of the bag - now we would have to actually deal with the issues effectively instead of just (dangerously) sweeping them under the rug.
<br>
<p>- Might somewhat help public awareness of the issues - hopefully that can be molded into a good thing.
<br>
<p>Overall, I think it's a close call. I think that the potential Risk:Benefit ratio is leaning ever so slightly in favor of Benefit. Careful execution can improve the odds. One thing that might help would be to include with OpenCog a folder that lays out the basic science and philosophy of Safe/Friendly AI. Why the AGI must be designed a certain way; and why a generic AGI will not automatically be safe, at all.

<p><a href="http://www.opencog.org/">http://www.opencog.org/</a>
<br>
<p>Safety is addressed only insofar as to say that risks will be minimal  
<br>
in the near future because they are only attempting weak AI for now  
<br>
and will worry more about risks and ethics when they need to.  In and  
<br>
of itself this attitude worries me, since it seems to assume that  
<br>
there's essentially no possibility of even accidentally creating  
<br>
something slightly smarter than EURISKO that goes FOOM!  Further, even  
<br>
if in the near term OpenCog doesn't pose a threat, the product of its  
<br>
research may create something that, in 10 to 20 years time, could  
<br>
serve as a jumping off point for someone who wants to throw a lot of  
<br>
computing power at the problem and create strong AI by brute forcing  
<br>
it.  However, since this is coming from SIAI and given Eliezer's  
<br>
conservative stance toward AI development, I can't help but wonder if  
<br>
the risks aren't as large as I suspect they are.
<br>
<p>If this has been discussed publicly elsewhere I'd appreciate a link to  
<br>
those discussions, but if not I think we need to have one here.
<br>
<p>How risky is OpenCog?  Is this risk a good tradeoff in that it will  
<br>
lead to the safe development of Friendly AI sooner?
