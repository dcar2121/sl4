</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; But if the transfer were unreliable it would only be by chance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; that the &quot;right&quot; sequence of states was set into motion giving
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  To me, that's as if we perfectly emulate a person's 48hr
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  life quite a few times without incident. Then in some run of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  single computer a God-particle level cosmic ray strikes at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  midnight on Monday, and the rest of the computation takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  off in an entirely random and different direction, probably no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  longer emulating the same person at all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  To you, is that equivalent also?
</em><br>
<p>No, the cosmic ray would cause a different computation. But if instead
<br>
the cosmic ray set off a Monday computation that otherwise wouldn't
<br>
have happened, that would be the same as a deliberate Monday
<br>
computation from the point of view of the internal observers.
<br>
<p>What you refer to as the significance of a causal link in computation
<br>
is equivalent to what is sometimes called the requirement that the
<br>
computational system &quot;handle counterfactuals&quot;. For example, if some
<br>
event on Monday had been different, then should be taken into account
<br>
by the computation and events on Tuesday would also have been
<br>
different; whereas if Tuesday just happened due to a random event this
<br>
sort of sensitivity to Monday would be lacking. The idea is that if
<br>
the computational system doesn't handle counterfactuals it is not only
<br>
useless for computation, but also that it doesn't give rise to
<br>
consciousness. But while it is obvious that a computation that doesn't
<br>
handle counterfactuals is useless to an external observer, it isn't
<br>
obvious that it would lack an internal observer. You would have to
<br>
invoke seemingly magical effects to explain how the computation knows
<br>
or cares that it hasn't been &quot;properly&quot; implemented when there is
<br>
nothing in the physical states underpinning it which indicates this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  What is the appeal to you and Schmidhuber and the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  the gang to all that dust comprising 0.99999999999 of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;&gt;  experience?  That would seem to me to induce fatalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Determinism, yes. Is that the same as fatalism?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I mean something like this:  Suppose that I hear that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  extremely large asteroid by sheer luck is barreling down on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the Earth at thousands of kilometers per second. I see this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  as a big, big hit on my runtime. (We're all going to die.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Why, in the Tegmark example, there is no other Lee Corbin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  for about 10^10^29 lightyears from here. So for me personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  not to mention all the people I love, this (to me) is very bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  news.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  How is it for you?   If 0.99999999999 of you (say in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  visible universe 10^42 ly across), is unaffected by the asteroid,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  why worry?
</em><br>
<p>You're assuming that you somehow know that you are the &quot;real&quot; Lee
<br>
Corbin, as opposed to all those simulations in Platonia. But if the
<br>
theory you scoff at is for the sake of argument right, there is no
<br>
reason to posit a separate, concrete universe at all. And you can
<br>
still hope that the computational branches where the asteroid misses
<br>
the Earth are of higher measure than the ones where it hits.
