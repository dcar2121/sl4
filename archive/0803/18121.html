<em>&gt; Thanks for your side of the history. You could be right. I've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never heard him say, &quot;Oops. Sorry, mistaken about that&quot;, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sorry I gave the wrong impression&quot;, or &quot;okay, the way *you*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are using words, then...&quot; or any similar concession. But alas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that applies to almost every bloody person on these lists  :-(
</em><br>
<p>How could I have acknowledged a mistake I had never made in the first place?
<br>
<p>I've been talking about uniqueness of activity/process from day one and never 
<br>
supported the idea that in order to survive I must maintain the same exact atoms I 
<br>
was born with. That's ridiculous.
<br>
<p>What happened was that Clark never grasped the difference between uniqueness of 
<br>
atoms and uniqueness of activity/process. In his mind, one implies the other and 
<br>
vice versa. And whenever I would attempt to explain to him that these things were 
<br>
independent of each other, he would refuse to believe me and immediately skip to 
<br>
name calling and ridiculing me for saying that maintaining the same exact atoms is 
<br>
necessary for survival; something I never believed.
<br>
<p>Imagine someone accusing you year after year that you've been trying to convince 
<br>
the whole world that 3+4=46, and then refusing to believe you whenever you say you 
<br>
never believed 3+4=46, let alone tried to convince anyone of this falsehood. What 
<br>
would you do?
