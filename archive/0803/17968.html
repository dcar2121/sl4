<em>&gt;  Anyway, I claim it isn't even *imaginable* how two truly separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people (on the usual meaning of words), e.g. William Shakespeare
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and Albert Einstein, could be merged, without, as you say, creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &quot;massive psychological problems&quot;, or a completely confused brand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  new person.
</em><br>
<p>Oh! A challenge! :-)
<br>
<p>Let's take a year, to do it properly. Start with Einstein, and try and
<br>
add Shakespeare (a retired Shakespear back at Stradford-upon-Avon).
<br>
Every night we have our little mind-manipulator-o-matic, and change a
<br>
little bit of Einstein's mind. To keep it simple, let's assume Al is
<br>
aware we are doing this, and doesn't object (so won't get panicked
<br>
when he starts remembering queen elizabeth in 1938).
<br>
<p>First, we add the instinctive memories; we add the memories of Will's
<br>
plays to the background of Al's mind. There must be some point in Al's
<br>
life in which he was an actor (maybe for a School production?); we
<br>
amplify that memory, maybe multiply it a bit, until Al has the skills
<br>
needed to be an actor. Then we add more of Will's skill set to Al.
<br>
Maybe build a small model of a theatre and of a street in old London,
<br>
so he can practice his new skills. In each case, we do it my taking a
<br>
memory of Einstein's and modifying it (there aren't so many
<br>
architypes, so this should be possible). A few examples:
<br>
<p>- Everyone has a memory of being unaffected by some foul odour while
<br>
others were affected. Expand on that, make it more a part of Al's
<br>
being, until he can walk around old London with unblocked nose.
<br>
<p>- Everyone has an experience of swallowing their pride and defering to
<br>
authority. Similarly, everyone has some basic social skills, and knows
<br>
you should somethimes keep quiet what you wanted to say. Build on both
<br>
these memories, until Al can accomplish the double-speak and deference
<br>
to authority that is needed in Elizabethan england. Since these are
<br>
very much in conflict with Al's personality, transmute his natural
<br>
urges to independent thought into writting plays. Make him think of
<br>
this as his &quot;act of resistance&quot; and he will accept the other
<br>
restrictions more.
<br>
<p>In such a way, we can give Al most of Will's skill set. Now we can
<br>
start actually adding memories. Dribble them in, bit my bit, leaving
<br>
them in the background; the idea is that just as some people say &quot;ah
<br>
yes, when I was young in Italy...&quot; and have a seperate memory zone for
<br>
this, Al can now say &quot;ah yes, when I was Shakespear in Old London...&quot;
<br>
<p>We then cross reference these memories with concepts. For example, the
<br>
word &quot;fashion&quot; should link immediately back to the Will memories,
<br>
while &quot;quantum physics&quot; should link to Al's. Concepts like &quot;how the
<br>
universe works&quot; should link to both. This will also allow us to cross
<br>
link both sets of memories; so that the subject can say: &quot;Saw
<br>
Roosevelt at the theatre two years back; the place was quite regal,
<br>
but my little Globe had more character. It's a shame Roosevelt and the
<br>
Queen never met; they'd have got on quite well. As long as she took a
<br>
bath first, that is...&quot;
<br>
One possible hook to help link these memories: I had a role-playing
<br>
phase in my callow youth, and have some memories of what happened to
<br>
my character. I can perfecty link those memories with those that
<br>
really happened to me. If I did so, and used the word &quot;I&quot; when
<br>
refering to my character, I could come up with sentences like the one
<br>
just above. Reinforcing this tendancy shouldn't be too hard.
<br>
<p>There will be contradictions here, but people can live with
<br>
contradictions; more importantly, they can resolve them. During this
<br>
period, we encourage Al-Will to not too much conceptual thinking.
<br>
<p>Then finally, when we have implanted all of Will's memories, we put
<br>
our subject on mind numbing drugs for the rest of the year, and put
<br>
him though a routine, dull, and boring existence. This allows us to
<br>
avoid the pitfalls of &quot;who was I yesterday&quot; and such things; before we
<br>
&quot;wake him up&quot;, we can then fit both Al's and Will's memories into the
<br>
category &quot;recent but not immediate past&quot;.
<br>
<p>Lastly, the most important part: we wake up Al-Will, and have him
<br>
resolve his own contradictions. Since he lives in the modern era, and
<br>
knows about planes across the Atlantic, he will probably keep most of
<br>
the science in his world view; but it will be heavily laced with an
<br>
artistic outlook, an urge to put it all into words, and a host of
<br>
superstitions. Some aspects of Al will fade away; so will some aspects
<br>
of Will. Others will complement and reinforce each other. His vision
<br>
of his place in the world will be a fascinating thing to watch... I
<br>
would also like to see his politics!
<br>
<p>Does this sound imaginable?
<br>
<p>And if it is doable in the above sense, it's certainly also doable at
<br>
high speed and with a subject who doesn't agree to the process.
<br>
<p>Stuart
