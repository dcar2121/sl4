<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Yes, I was exploring the idea that a random system might still have

<em>&gt;  &gt; &quot;objective meaning&quot;. It will of course be meaningless to any external
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; observer, but it might be meaningful to its own *internal* observers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a remarkable thesis, and I'm a little skeptical. If by &quot;random&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  you mean that the system really does have KC equal to its size in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bits, (what I mean by &quot;random&quot;), then it defies my understanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that it could even have internal observers.
</em><br>
<p>The decimal expansion of pi looks random but contains any string of
<br>
digits you care to nominate, if you calculate it to enough places
<br>
[actually I don't think this has been proven, but it is conjectured to
<br>
be so]. That is, the ensemble looks random, but it contains islands of
<br>
structure hidden in the noise. If these islands of structure contain
<br>
observers, they will be no less conscious for the fact that an
<br>
observer outside the ensemble can't find them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't want to be picky, but how long is a &quot;moment&quot;?  For me, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  there is no information flow, there cannot be consciousness. &lt;sigh&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I admit that by &quot;information flow&quot; I'm subscribing to a belief in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the importance of time as a basic physical reality---I've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bought into Barbour's views or any of that. It's all too theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and unsure.
</em><br>
<p>You seemed to agree earlier on that there wouldn't be a problem if the
<br>
moments lasted a day. You would experience Monday followed by Tuesday,
<br>
each day subjectively one day long, no matter what the details of
<br>
their separate implementation. Even if they occurred in separate
<br>
Hubble volumes (as indeed they must, purely by chance, if the universe
<br>
is infinite) with no chance of information flow between them you would
<br>
experience Monday followed by Tuesday.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  For example, if you were right, then it could be that coherent local
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  small systems like Lee Corbin are only 0.00000000001 of where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I really get my runtime.  In that case, it wouldn't matter if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  particular organization in this little corner of California in this little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  corner of our galaxy continued to execute.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Important: morally, it wouldn't be such a great crime to wipe out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people here on this little planet, since .9999999999 of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  experience would go on just as before (on the reading, say, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  our level-one universe is incredibly vast, but not infinite, and there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  is just one planet Earth).
</em><br>
<p>If every computation is necessarily implemented by virtue of its
<br>
status as a platonic object then there is no basis for saying that
<br>
there is a separate &quot;real&quot; universe. Instead, what you think of and
<br>
everyone has always thought of as the real universe is a subset of a
<br>
wider mathematical reality. Your living in a world with orderly
<br>
physical laws would then have to be explained probabilistically as
<br>
following the computational paths of highest measure. For example,
<br>
algorithmic probability theory predicts that given a universal machine
<br>
generating and running random programs, shorter programs have a higher
<br>
probability. It takes much less information to specify a universe
<br>
according to a set of simple physical laws and parameters than to
<br>
&quot;hand code&quot; a universe in which all sorts of weirdness takes place.
