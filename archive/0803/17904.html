John Clark writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Objectivity is of trivial importance, subjectivity is the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important thing in the universe; at least in my subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion.
</em><br>
<p>I grant that your subjective experience (or &quot;subjectivity&quot; if
<br>
you insist on a noun) is the most important thing in the world
<br>
to you. Actually, for me, mine is not.  I can imagine sacrificing
<br>
the quality of my subjective experience for a number of things.
<br>
<p>Objectivity---the process of trying to be objective---is important 
<br>
for many, many reasons.  It's our road to the truth.  It's what
<br>
everyone from scientists to consciencious journalists should
<br>
strive for. To try to say and understand what is objectively true
<br>
about the world is what saves us from subjectivity and
<br>
superstition. 
<br>
<p>Also, it's vital because we can *discuss* whatever is objective 
<br>
You and I may discuss a distant nebula, and refer to it as a
<br>
thing outside our skins, refer to it without any mention of our
<br>
subjective impressions.
<br>
<p>Subjective experiences, as you know, have the grave defect that
<br>
we really cannot accurately communicate them to each other,
<br>
e.g., &quot;Is my red the same as your red?&quot;  It is this feature that lies
<br>
at the heart of all the hopeless quagmire of talk of qualia.
<br>
<p>It also vastly adds to the difficultiess in discussing consciousness
<br>
and trying to get a handle on it.
<br>
<p>To think of &quot;the big C&quot; as an objective phenomenon characteristic
<br>
of some objects/entities---and not characteristic (or only very
<br>
marginally characteristic) of others---makes possible scientific
<br>
progress towards understanding. But discussions of the subjective
<br>
nature of consciousness lead utterly nowhere.
<br>
<p>Lee
