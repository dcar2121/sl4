</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; There is no test to tell whether something has experiences or just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &gt; expresses belief in experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Yes.  But there will still be a fact of the matter, whether or not we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; able to learn it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact is that experience doesn't exist.  Of course you will disagree.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will the robot.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Experience doesn't exist&quot;?  You mean to say that you don't have an
<br>
experience right now of sitting in front of a monitor?  That you have
<br>
not the experience of reading an email or watching TV?  You mean to
<br>
say that the experience of skiing down a slope doesn't exist?  You
<br>
are using the word in a way that I've never heard before. 
<br>
<p>Whether a robot has an experience depends on its complexity.  We
<br>
can safely say that the very nice robots the Japanese have recently
<br>
built have no experiences, any more than a car has experiences. 
<br>
(Granted, at some level, it may be argued that everything has
<br>
experiences, but those of ants, viruses, and stones are infinitesimally
<br>
rudimentary.)
<br>
<p>Eventually robots could have &quot;inner lives&quot; as complex as ours or more,
<br>
when one day they have enough intelligence/consciousness.
