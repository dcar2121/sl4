<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; (a) The file I've received says that the final state of the Australian

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; input that into my machine, the computation won't know it has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; spread across two continents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  How did you get a hold of S-2037?   If you looked it up somewhere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  or heard from a little bird that you should try S-2037, then the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  would be no. But if you worked out, i.e., your brain emulated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  machine itself, i.e. calculated state S-2037 from S-6754, then yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  no [infinitesimal] interruption occurred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I looked it up. The physics of the machine is such that state A will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reliably transition to state B. This can either be worked out from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first principles or by experiment, and the results stored in a table.
</em><br>
<p>But if the result of this calculation is merely stored in a table,
<br>
and subsequent &quot;calculations&quot; just access and exhibit this
<br>
result, then no genuine computation is performed the second
<br>
and later times.  Only the first calculation was authentic, and
<br>
also authentic in the sense that I believe consciousness during
<br>
any particular run to depend on this authenticity of computation.
<br>
(To appeal---perhap a bit illogically but perhaps not---to an
<br>
analogy, only once did Clinton say &quot;it depend on what you
<br>
mean by &quot;is&quot; &quot;, and no matter how many times that's televised,
<br>
those are just lookups, and he gets no runtime out of any them.) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The entire computation could be done by hand in this way by a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operator who blindly follows the rules and has no more idea where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules came from (or the grander purpose behind his actions) than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual gear or transistor does. We have need to agree that the causal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link is preserved in (a), with *no* interruption in consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before considering (b) and (c).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, we do need to stop here (at least for now), and resolve this
<br>
first.
<br>
<p>And yes, just like the transistors, the human operator need have no
<br>
understanding of what he's doing, so long as he's following definite
<br>
prescribed rules that happen to be isomorphic to the physics that
<br>
determines one state from earlier states in the transistors.
