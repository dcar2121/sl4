Lay off the drugs.
<br>
<p>You are just talking about rational choice theory,
<br>
which neither says much of anything about human action
<br>
which is frequently irrational, nor does it ensure
<br>
that an AGI would choose to be friendly.
<br>
<p>At the very least you could have tried to prove this
<br>
with symbolic logic or something. If you had tried,
<br>
I'm sure you would find the formulas don't add up.
<br>
<p>Take one of Eliezer's examples of an AGI that loves
<br>
smiley faces and ends up tiling the universe with
<br>
smiley faces. How would any of this prevent that? It
<br>
wouldn't. Acid test over, you lose.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Executive Summary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been arguing on the AGI list that a great way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ensure the stability of Friendliness for AGI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be to make it so that it was in an entity's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own self-interest to be Friendly (I've been calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this the Attractor Theory of Friendliness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's obvious from hindsight, but while working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, I had the epiphany that it was only to my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit to declare Friendliness myself (duh, if it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any AGI/entity's self-interest, then it must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in *my* self-interest).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have therefore declared Friendliness (codifying it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the declaration below) and am attempting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread it since it can be used to derive useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical guidelines for AGIs, humans, and all other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities to follow because it is in their own best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest &lt;and mine&gt; to do so).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am also promoting my catchy new slogan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Friendliness:  The Ice-9 of Ethics and the Ultimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Self-Interest&quot; as a good way to spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness.        :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; = = = = = = = = = =
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A Little More Detail
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that I have come up with a formulation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness that is stable under self-improvement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because, *as far as I can tell* (the big gotcha), it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in an entity's own best self-interest to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendly (according to the formulation -- but with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the realization that there *probably* is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-Friendliness that is even better that is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subset of this Friendliness).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This formulation is simple enough that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence required to analyze whether an action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is Friendly or not (according to the formulation) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially below the intelligence required to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a significant threat to humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolute proof that the formulation will always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function as we desire under all conditions is beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my capabilities (at this point in time) but since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the derivable conclusions of this formulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; include many of the generally-agreed but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously-difficult-to-prove points of ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior and do not contradict any points of ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior that I know of, I believe that we should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as safe as is ethically possible (i.e. if it comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down to a choice between humanity or ten other more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; populous, more intelligent races -- we're still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toast).  Thus far, on the AGI mailing list, no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been able to propose a scenario where humanity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or an entity) is destroyed or abused where it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not either *clearly* contradictory to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulation or *clearly* ethically permissible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to be destroyed/abused.  This list is now an acid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test to see if anyone here can come up with such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since I believe that crossing ethical boundaries for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sake of our safety is a *BAD* idea (because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making this allowance for ourselves actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diminishes our safety because it effectively gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others permission to cross this boundary as well --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. not be Friendly), I strongly suspect that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *is* formally provable that we cannot be safer than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;as safe as ethically possible&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems obvious in hindsight but it was an epiphany
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I realized while working on this that it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be highly beneficial to *me* to officially declare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself to be a Friendly entity (according to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formulation) since doing so was only in my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest.  I have done so on the AGI list and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am doing so again below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The coolest thing is that I think that the core of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these ideas can be captured in a single catchy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogan &quot;Friendliness:  The Ice-9 of Ethics and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ultimate in Self-Interest&quot;.  Given the probable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of super-Friendliness, it's a bit of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hyperbole but I think that it's fully justified to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote the spread of Friendliness (which is in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *all* of our best interest).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There have been some fun discussions going on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the AGI list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.listbox.com/member/archive/303/=now">http://www.listbox.com/member/archive/303/=now</a>)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including a great alien contact scenario thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; titled 'A Few Questions for &quot;Vladimir, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Destroyer&quot;' and I am inviting any and all to take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swing at my strawman (just make it a competent swing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  :-).

<em>&gt; The Friendliness Declaration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi, I’m Mark Waser.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am hereby declaring myself to be a Friendly entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as of March 12, 2008.  I have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowingly/intentionally performed any UnFriendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions since this date.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have not previously been declared UnFriendly by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any declared Friendly entity.    I have not been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requested to put any disputed actions or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unintentional UnFriendly actions in this declaration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by any declared Friendly entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am voluntarily undertaking the goals of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness because I understand that doing so is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my own best self-interest and is the best way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve all my other goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am voluntarily undertaking the primary/overriding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal of Friendliness as my primary and pre-eminent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal.  I understand this goal to be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do not act contrary to someone’s/anyone’s goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unless absolutely necessary for the fulfillment of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable/rational personal goal (explicitly not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including generic sub-goals like money, power,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleasure, religion, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am voluntarily undertaking the goal of spreading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness and assigning it a reasonable priority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (i.e. enough to be a net asset to a Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Society) because I understand that doing so is in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own self-interest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I will act in accordance with these goals according
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the rules/laws of a Friendly Society included in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this declaration.  I understand that if I knowingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and intentionally act contrary to these rules/laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I can be declared UnFriendly and will need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make another declaration of Friendliness including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about the most recent times that I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been declared UnFriendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that the rules/laws of a Friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Society include the requirement that all statements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this declaration be truthful under penalty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having this declaration declared null and void and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my being declared UnFriendly for attempting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impersonate a Friendly entity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In particular, I understand that hiding or lying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about any UnFriendly actions (even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unintentionally or unknowingly performed) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary to the rules/laws of a Friendly Society.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that while I may defend myself against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfair charges of UnFriendly actions, I must admit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to all UnFriendly actions (even if unknowingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or intentionally performed) and must include all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disputed charges in this declaration as requested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a reasonable length of time or risk having this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declaration declared null and void and my being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declared UnFriendly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand that the rules/laws of Friendly Society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state that declaring another entity UnFriendly is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in itself, UnFriendly unless there is reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause for doing so, I have executed a reasonable due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process, and am sure beyond reasonable doubt.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand that the rules/laws further require that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I retract any declarations of UnFriendliness if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *any* reasonable doubt subsequently arises and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must volunteer my most recent retractions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UnFriendliness declarations (if any) when asked and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in any subsequent UnFriendliness declarations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &lt;signed&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
