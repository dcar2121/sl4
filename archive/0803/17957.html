<p><em>&gt;&gt;  &gt; I don't think anything in this thread is all that paradoxical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Right.  As regards *anticipation*, not yet.  I should dig up my old
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  essay &quot;The Anticipation Paradox&quot; and post it.  The bottom line
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is that there are TEs in which you have to look forward (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &quot;anticipate&quot;) something that already happened to you.(!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anticipating something that already happened to you is definitely not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible with my definition of anticipate.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly!  It has to be impossible. So I gave up on &quot;anticipation&quot;,
<br>
and now regard it as this somewhat irrational module nature had
<br>
to endow us with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think your problem may be that you're using a poor definition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anticipate.  The purpose of anticipation is to prepare a current brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state to be able to respond appropriately for some future change in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that brain state (when it is exposed to a new event and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modified to become a new brain state).
</em><br>
<p>Right.  That's why in 1986 I was so disturbed by a certain TE that
<br>
I had concocted that I'd just pace the halls at work, unable to focus
<br>
on my job.  I published a very condensed version of it in 1994 in
<br>
&quot;The Venturist&quot;, a Mike Perry cryonics-related publication. I once
<br>
tried to write it up in a more user-friendly story-telling style, but
<br>
it's just too complicated.  But NOT too complicated for the people
<br>
here.  I'm sorely tempted to give it another shot.  I don't have to
<br>
explain determinism, for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  Note how totally and completely different (and impossible so far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  as I know) for memory merging to plausibly take place between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  two actually different people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand what you mean by &quot;actually different&quot;, since in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example you gave, you're merging two &quot;actually different&quot; people.
</em><br>
<p>In my example, the two duplicates (well, one original and one copy)
<br>
were extremely similar. I call these &quot;close duplicates&quot;. You are a
<br>
close duplicate of the person you were yesterday.  It would be
<br>
theoretically possible to take a copy of the you that you were
<br>
yesterday, and just &quot;add&quot; some memories (what happened to
<br>
you today) and subtract others (what you have forgotten), and
<br>
this is in fact what nature easily and routinely accomplishes.
<br>
<p>In my example, the copy---who had gone to a movie and the
<br>
original---who had stopped at a bookstore meanwhile, could
<br>
relatively easily have their memories merged because, forgive
<br>
the language, &quot;they are the same person&quot; (with only tiny
<br>
differences).  We just take the original, who naturally remembers
<br>
going to the bookstore, and &quot;add&quot; the memory of getting off
<br>
the freeway early, going to the movie and watching it, and getting
<br>
back on the freeway. (I will say that he is then too tired or it is
<br>
too late to satisfy an urge he might also have to visit the bookstore.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's no such thing as two identical people, unless you're talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about right at the single moment you copy someone.  One millisecond
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afterwards they are already two different people, with a different set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of memories and behavior.
</em><br>
<p>I think that that is quite wrong.  You are the same person from minute
<br>
to minute, even though the changes to you are vast, vast, vast by
<br>
comparison to the &quot;change&quot; one millisecond later that takes place
<br>
with copying (e.g. teleporting).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In your example, they would be very different by the time they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were merged again and probably completely unmergable.
</em><br>
<p>Well, why?  We can easily imagine the outcome.  So you go on:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Memory in humans is not stored at a single memory address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like it is in a desktop computer.  When you're exposed to new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences, it recongifgures whole clusters of neurons and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure of your brain and the interconnections between lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different things change.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say it would be easy!  I said that it is theoretically possible.
<br>
We &quot;just&quot; adjust all those neurons.  Compared to the bulk of the
<br>
neurons that constitute your memories---who you are---they're
<br>
nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's highly sensitive to the order in which you experience things,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as new events will change the way you understand past events,
</em><br>
<p>That's why the TE I presented about the copy going to the movie
<br>
had to be carefully done, so that later it wouldn't seem strange to
<br>
him that he totally forgot about the movie while he was at the
<br>
bookstore---or, since it's weeks later, whichever came first.
<br>
This depends on the fact that surely two separate, memorable
<br>
things happened to you last month, but you don't recall which
<br>
happened first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I have no proof that it's impossible, I have a very hard time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagining any plausible way you could accomplish such a merge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you could do a very &quot;dirty merge&quot;, but there would be a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambiguity and choices to be made about all of the conflicting neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modifications that are present in both of the copies... it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteed to cause massive psychological problems, even if the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was similar enough that they had only been split for an hour or less.
</em><br>
<p>Would it be easier to imagine if they were already uploaded?  Would it
<br>
be easier to imagine if we're already running in a sim?
<br>
<p>Anyway, I claim it isn't even *imaginable* how two truly separate
<br>
people (on the usual meaning of words), e.g. William Shakespeare
<br>
and Albert Einstein, could be merged, without, as you say, creating
<br>
&quot;massive psychological problems&quot;, or a completely confused brand
<br>
new person.
