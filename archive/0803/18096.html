</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm sorry.  I didn't see this before and I'm posting an objection now.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanobots *are* cooperating with each other but they are stomping all over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity.  That is UnFriendly in exactly the same sense that humans 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terraforming another world with a native sentient species would be extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unFriendly on the part of the humans. Humans have no special status.  They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should not be stomped on.  They should also be not be stomping on others.
</em><br>
<p>There are a number of ways in which humans could become extinct without our
<br>
goals being stomped on.  Human goals are appropriate for survival in a
<br>
primitive world, not a world where we can have everything we want.  If you
<br>
want 1000 permanent orgasms or a simulated fantasy world with a magic genie,
<br>
then the nanobots go into your brain and your wishes are granted.  What
<br>
difference does it make to you if your brain is re-implemented more
<br>
efficiently as gray goo and your body and world are simulated?  You're not
<br>
going to know.  Does this count as extinction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Without competition between groups (e.g. wars), there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no evolutionary pressure to maintain goals that promote group survival.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this is where we currently have a fundamental disagreement, I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contending that the competition at lower levels or the competition against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the environment (and, as long as your goals aren't fulfilled, you *ARE* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competing against your environment to fulfilll them) *IS* sufficient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pressure to maintain the goal of survival for the competing lower-level 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entity which then trickles up to group survival.  Also, if the group is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-improving and has any goals, it will then the Omohundro drive for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-preservation.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're right that competition doesn't necessarily imply agents killing
<br>
each other.  Rather, it is indirect.  When an agent acquires a limited
<br>
resource needed for its survival or reproduction, it reduces the survival or
<br>
reproduction probability of other agents.  Also, agents that cooperate (are
<br>
friendly) can acquire more resources on average than those that don't.  We
<br>
agree that evolution favors friendly groups over unfriendly groups.
<br>
<p>But we don't really have a choice over whether there is competition between
<br>
groups or not.  My bigger concern is the instability of evolution, like a
<br>
plague or population explosion that drastically changes the environment and
<br>
reduces the diversity of life.  Some of the proposals for controlling the
<br>
outcome of a singularity depend on a controlled catastrophe by setting the
<br>
initial dynamic in the right direction.  This is risky because catastrophes
<br>
are extremely sensitive to initial conditions.  But of course we are in the
<br>
midst of one now, a mass extinction larger than any other in the last 3.5
<br>
billion years.  We lack the computing power to model it, and there is no way
<br>
to acquire it in time because the process itself is needed to produce it.  So
<br>
it always stays a step ahead.  Sorry for the bad news.
