<p>Excellent!  I will add a disputed clause to my declaration.  I would request that you let me know when I can remove it.  I would argue that I should be able remove it immediately since there is reasonable doubt that 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a.. you are a Friendly entity because you yourself said &quot; I concede that I have made both Friendly and UnFriendly declarations in the name of Friendliness and must (under the rules presented so far) demand that you retract your declaration of Friendly and simultaneously retract my own.  I believe we have both been UnFriendly in our efforts to pursue a state of Friendly.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;b.. you performed sufficient due diligence before declaring me UnFriendly (since you didn't communicate with me and attempt to resolve our differences, most specifically including the differences between our individual versions of Friendliness since you did not understand that you should not have made your demand that I retract my declaration according to my stated rules).
<br>
May I remove the disputed clause from my declaration?  If you say yes immediately, then I will not insist upon a declaration of UnFriendly action (interfering with my declaration) be appended to your next declaration.  If you say no (or wait unreasonably long before replying), I shall insist on such a clause (for a fairly short period of time since I'm such a nice guy  :-).
<br>
<p>Thank you *VERY* much.  I enjoyed this!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Friendliness Declaration
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Mark Waser.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hereby declaring myself to be a Friendly entity as of March 12, 2008.  I have not knowingly/intentionally performed any UnFriendly actions since this date.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not previously been declared UnFriendly by any declared Friendly entity.    I have not been requested to put any disputed actions or unintentional UnFriendly actions in this declaration by any declared Friendly entity.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Mike.  I declare myself to be Friendly.  (Yes, that's a completely ambiguous term, but I know it means when I declare it)  I deem Mark Waser's declaration of Friendly to be hostile to my own definition of Friendly and therefor declare him to be UnFriendly.  (again, I'm not sure what exactly Mark means by his use of the term or the significance of camelCase used thereupon)  I hereby request a dispute resolution clause be added to the Mark's declaration of March 12, 2008 and further declare that the now defunct declaration no longer be declared.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not act contrary to someone's/anyone's goals unless absolutely necessary for the fulfillment of a reasonable/rational personal goal (explicitly not including generic sub-goals like money, power, pleasure, religion, etc.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am acting contrary to Mark's goals of declaring a state of Friendly for my own reasonable personal goal of illustrating the point that it's not so simple to generally define Friendly. 
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am voluntarily undertaking the goal of spreading Friendliness and assigning it a reasonable priority (i.e. enough to be a net asset to a Friendly Society) because I understand that doing so is in my own self-interest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My own self-interest&quot; is of no concern regarding Friendly Society.  You will be assimilated.  Resistance is a value of indeterminate measure and continues to be measured.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will act in accordance with these goals according to the rules/laws of a Friendly Society included in this declaration.  I understand that if I knowingly and intentionally act contrary to these rules/laws that I can be declared UnFriendly and will need to make another declaration of Friendliness including information about the most recent times that I have been declared UnFriendly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Won't that turn into a series of &quot;Hi my name is... and I've been Friendly for 2 whole days now....&quot; at the beginning of every Friendly Society Anonymous meeting?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the rules/laws of a Friendly Society include the requirement that all statements in this declaration be truthful under penalty of having this declaration declared null and void and my being declared UnFriendly for attempting to impersonate a Friendly entity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, I understand that hiding or lying about any UnFriendly actions (even if unintentionally or unknowingly performed) is contrary to the rules/laws of a Friendly Society.  I understand that while I may defend myself against unfair charges of UnFriendly actions, I must admit to all UnFriendly actions (even if unknowingly and/or intentionally performed) and must include all disputed charges in this declaration as requested for a reasonable length of time or risk having this declaration declared null and void and my being declared UnFriendly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that the rules/laws of Friendly Society state that declaring another entity UnFriendly is, in itself, UnFriendly unless there is reasonable cause for doing so, I have executed a reasonable due process, and am sure beyond reasonable doubt.  I understand that the rules/laws further require that I retract any declarations of UnFriendliness if *any* reasonable doubt subsequently arises and I must volunteer my most recent retractions of UnFriendliness declarations (if any) when asked and in any subsequent UnFriendliness declarations.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok,. you got me.  I'm no longer sure if I am in Fact Friendly or only Believe myself to be Friendly or alternatively FriEndly.  I concede that I have made both Friendly and UnFriendly declarations in the name of Friendliness and must (under the rules presented so far) demand that you retract your declaration of Friendly and simultaneously retract my own.  I believe we have both been UnFriendly in our efforts to pursue a state of Friendly.
