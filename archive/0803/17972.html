<p><em>&gt;&gt; To me, that's as if we perfectly emulate a person's 48hr
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  life quite a few times without incident. Then in some run of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  single computer a God-particle level cosmic ray strikes at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  midnight on Monday, and the rest of the computation takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  off in an entirely random and different direction, probably no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  longer emulating the same person at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  To you, is that equivalent also?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, the cosmic ray would cause a different computation.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry---did you get the wrong impression from my word &quot;equivalent&quot;?
<br>
I meant for the tremendously powerful cosmic ray to completely
<br>
change the computation, and so the Tuesday run would *not* in
<br>
any way be like the Tuesday computation that was supposed to
<br>
have run.  (By &quot;equivalent&quot;, I had meant equivalent to your fake
<br>
diskette substituted for the real Sj from Monday.)  Please, is
<br>
this clear now?  Or is there is some miscommunication here?
<br>
See the next few sentences just to be sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if instead the cosmic ray set off a Monday computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that otherwise wouldn't have happened,
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes!  That's just how I read you!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; that would be the same as a deliberate Monday computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the point of view of the internal observers.
</em><br>
<p>Eh?  The cosmic ray strikes at 12:00 midnight = 12am Tuesday
<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock</a> .   :-)  Just to make
<br>
sure that we are talking about something after the last state on
<br>
Monday and before the first state on Tuesday.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What you refer to as the significance of a causal link in computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is equivalent to what is sometimes called the requirement that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational system &quot;handle counterfactuals&quot;. For example, if some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; event on Monday had been different, then [it] should be taken into account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the computation and events on Tuesday would also have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different; whereas if Tuesday just happened due to a random event this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of sensitivity to Monday would be lacking.
</em><br>
<p>I think I understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea is that if the computational system doesn't handle counterfactuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not only useless for computation, but also that it doesn't give rise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Let's see if I understand you. If at 4pm on Monday we deliberately intervene
<br>
and change the state of the person's consciousness (say we introduce a slight
<br>
ringing, mild tinnitus, in his ears), then his subsequent remainder-of-Monday/
<br>
Tuesday experience is slightly different, the difference growing chaotically
<br>
of course.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;the computational system doesn't handle
<br>
counterfactuals&quot;:  *any* computational system will &quot;handle&quot; tiny damage
<br>
that creates a &quot;counter-factual&quot; in our usage here, no?  Now some of
<br>
those will be so extreme that the person (subject)  is killed, but others
<br>
will just mean a slightly different 8 + 24 hours. Right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But while it is obvious that a computation that doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle counterfactuals is useless to an external observer, it isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious that it would lack an internal observer. You would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invoke seemingly magical effects to explain how the computation knows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or cares that it hasn't been &quot;properly&quot; implemented when there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing in the physical states underpinning it which indicates this.
</em><br>
<p>I think I agree: In other words, like my &quot;tiny damage&quot; above?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  What is the appeal to you and Schmidhuber and the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  the gang to all that dust comprising 0.99999999999 of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt;  experience?  That would seem to me to induce fatalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I mean something like this:  Suppose that I hear that an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  extremely large asteroid by sheer luck is barreling down on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the Earth at thousands of kilometers per second. I see this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  as a big, big hit on my runtime. (We're all going to die.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Why, in the Tegmark example, there is no other Lee Corbin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  for about 10^10^29 lightyears from here. So for me personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  not to mention all the people I love, this (to me) is very bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  news.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Bad news&quot;, of course, to the instance *here*. But by my lights,
<br>
the total Lees in almost all the solar systems are unaffected. Still---
<br>
this instance does often worry about its own skin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; How is it for you?   If 0.99999999999 of you (say in the visible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; universe 10^42 ly across), is unaffected by the asteroid, why worry?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're assuming that you somehow know that you are the &quot;real&quot; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corbin, as opposed to all those simulations in Platonia.
</em><br>
<p>Eh?  No, not at all.  To me Platonia is a configuration space, but
<br>
only the Lees in the Tegmark Levels 1, 2, and 3 get runtime.
<br>
To me, Platonia doesn't host simulations (emulations) because 
<br>
it's timeless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if the theory you scoff at is for the sake of argument right, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no reason to posit a separate, concrete universe at all. And you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still hope that the computational branches where the asteroid misses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Earth are of higher measure than the ones where it hits.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  For now  :-)
<br>
