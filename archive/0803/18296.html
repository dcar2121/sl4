<p><p>How many AI bets has DARPA already placed?  How many have produced AI?
<br>
<p>Even if it is possible in theory to separate the wheat from the chaff,  
<br>
there is ample evidence that the government possesses no such insight  
<br>
nor has any faith in its own ability to discern such things as  
<br>
evidenced by its shotgun method for selecting AI paths.  They are  
<br>
planning on being lucky rather than smart, because &quot;being smart&quot; has  
<br>
failed them more times than they can count in this endeavor.
<br>
<p>Organizations with a long-term entrenched interest in AI tend to be  
<br>
thoroughly skeptical of AI research, and there is very little to  
<br>
distinguish one AI theory/flavor from another.  If you are worried  
<br>
about the military taking the research early on, you should look at  
<br>
this as a blessing; they will be certain that your research is full of  
<br>
crap just like the hundreds of other research projects that never  
<br>
produced anything of value beyond parlor tricks.
<br>
<p><p>No one is so special that their crappy flavor of Yet Another AI  
<br>
Project will attract any real interest from the Powers That Be until  
<br>
the technology is sufficiently developed that it can distinguish  
<br>
itself from all other AI projects by force of capability.  At which  
<br>
point, you have AI and the Powers That Be are a day late.  The  
<br>
government has better things to do than monitor thousands of AI cranks  
<br>
just in case one of them does something interesting.
