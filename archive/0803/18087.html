Slawek writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I think so. Suppose that people are different from each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because of specific characteristics, brain structures, and so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on (and not because their soul has a different #ID-num).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I agree with the assumption that people are different.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree with why they are different.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry for proceeding so slowly and carefully, but our differences
<br>
seem profound, and the chance for miscommunication very great.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Suppose further that in general people don't want to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much more like someone else than like themselves;  specifically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; person X does not want to lose what makes him X and thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; become, say, his friend Max (person Y).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's focus on this because this is where you are assuming what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm asking you to explain. Why is it important to be *like*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something? As before, concept of  &quot;survival&quot; cannot be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the explanation.
</em><br>
<p>Do you want to be &quot;like&quot; Brittany Spears and have large tits? Do
<br>
you want to be &quot;like&quot; a Nazi war criminal who remembers joyfully
<br>
working &quot;subhumans&quot; to death (even though, naturally, you would
<br>
not enjoy the recollections---they might even give you nightmares).
<br>
<p>I haven't answered your last question. I sort of have to throw up
<br>
my hands. I cannot explain why you don't want to be like certain
<br>
deformed people who have two heads, and I can't explain why
<br>
you don't want to be &quot;like&quot; a rodent. We have to start somewhere,
<br>
Slawek.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you got all of Lee Corbin's memories and retained none of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Slawek's then would you (on your idea of what you &quot;is&quot;) behave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more like Lee or more like Slawek?  Specifically, what if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; credibly offer to pay you $100,000,000 to let your memories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be entirely replaced by mine. Would you take the deal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, but under one condition.
</em><br>
<p>I was afraid of that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You couldn't erase or alter my views on survival. This would prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you from easily convincing this now rich mind instance, formerly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labeled &quot;Slawek,&quot; from giving back your money and shutting down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you perceive as a worthless copy without any resistance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nice try, Lee. You are evil. ;-)
</em><br>
<p>I am not evil!   :-)   That mere condition is of comparatively trivial
<br>
importance.  So my new instance is pretty selfish about his $100M
<br>
won't share for some unknown reason.  Fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lee:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; All I can say is &quot;wow!&quot;.  Hmm.  Would you settle, say, for $25,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in *cash*?  I could use the New Jersey runtime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get the feeling that, after I told you my survival is not attached to my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories, you're immediately jumping to wrong conclusion that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories must be cheap or even worthless. Absolutely not. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point is that personal memories are precious, but their loss/replacement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't kill me (just like some loss/replacement of atoms doesn't kill me).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I compared memories to clothes before and I think it's a pretty good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy. Or let's try jewelry. It's very expensive and can have a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentimental value for people, yet its loss doesn't kill the owner. I view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories in a similar way.  They do not define my existence even though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're worth much more than $25K. :-)
</em><br>
<p>But your memories are worth *only* sentimental value, and have nothing
<br>
else to do with your identity.  Now if I were truly evil, I would take you
<br>
at your word and say &quot;Well, Slawek may be right or I might be right&quot;,
<br>
and then when I got rich enough I'd do it:  plant all the Lee Corbin 
<br>
memories for some adequately large monetary compensation to my
<br>
new selfish duplicate. (On my usage of words.)  Of course I don't want
<br>
to pin you down to an exact figure (that would be stupid), but could you
<br>
give me the correct half-order magnitude of money you'd need?  $50,000?
<br>
$100,000?   $300,000?  $1,000,000?   Please be as honest as you can,
<br>
of course, since this is strictly hypothetical and you have to remember that
<br>
by my lights I would be killing you, an utterly unacceptable act.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I'm pretty sure that in the future, you'll be able to &quot;purchase&quot; and download very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cool memories from virtual &quot;stores&quot; (and that's even before your inevitable and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable transformation into a completely different/alien psychological construct). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These memories will be at least 100 times more vivid, meaningful and fun than your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; old memories and you'll want to remember them. After you get them, you won't even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bother accessing the old, boring ones.
</em><br>
<p>I will always access my old memories, and frequently, so long as I'm me,
<br>
by God. Your scenario faintly brings up the oft-discussed possibility of
<br>
changing so much that (in my view) I have evolved into someone else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; There *are* other things I can be attached to, you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Like what?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before an answer could make sense I would have to disengage two gears currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully meshed and rotating at a high speed in your mind.
</em><br>
<p>In *my* mind?  I just asked you a straightforward question. Feel free
<br>
to explain your answers afterwards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's a lot of inertia I'm working against here. :-) The first gear is called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;personal memories&quot; that happily engages the second gear called &quot;survival&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before a replacement gear can engage &quot;survival&quot; gear, first I have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disengage &quot;personal memories&quot; from &quot;survival&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You need do nothing of the kind.  Just answer the bloody question!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by getting to the core of why memories are important or why &quot;being like&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something is important. After you'll see that this core is hollow, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it should be easier to describe an alternative core that isn't so hollow.
</em><br>
<p>Yass, like &quot;Lee, you wouldn't understand my deep &quot;things&quot; that I
<br>
would be attached to, you're understanding at this point is still 
<br>
too shallow.&quot;  Go ahead.  Mention them those things.  You never
<br>
can tell. I just want to understand what you're attached to since
<br>
it's not your atoms and not your memories.  But, pray, don't react
<br>
to this *last* question unless you have answered the simple, earlier
<br>
one, or more satisfactorily explained why it is not possible for you
<br>
to answer. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yeah, so what does that tell you about importance of runtime vs. memories? You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have had all your memories intact forever and yet you didn't choose this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; option. Interesting.
</em><br>
<p>As heaven is my witness, I have never in the last 40 years dismissed
<br>
what today I call runtime or processing!  As you say, the memories
<br>
without any possibility whatsoever in all the future history of the universe
<br>
getting runtime are totally worthless to me.  I have said that again and
<br>
again, I'm pretty sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Option 2) In 1 minute all your personal memories will be completely erased
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; from your brain, but, other than that, this brain will function just like any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; other healthy brain that's able to form and retain new personal memories and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; remember all the general knowledge acquired throughout the brain's life,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; like being able to speak, read and write English, do math, etc. However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; this brain will not remember its name, its opinions, its family and friends,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; its tastes, where it's located, none of that personal stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Option 2 is only slightly preferable because I'm still a bit of an idealist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and think that it's better for some mystery person (whoever he is) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exist than not exist.  But alas, for me, selfishly?  To me, I'm dead as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a doornail either way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you're dead, then who is this new person in the 2nd option?
</em><br>
<p>He's just some clown with total, irreversible amnesia.  I hope you
<br>
don't demand that I give him a name or something.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should he continue to bear Lee Corbin label or continue to have an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access to Lee Corbin's bank account?
</em><br>
<p>No.  My relatives should inherit my savings, and it doesn't matter,
<br>
except for medical records, I suppose, what they call the thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When Ronald Reagan died, nobody questioned it was Ronald Reagan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who died, and not some John Doe. If people thought he was John Doe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would cable news stations have shown 3-4-hour live coverage from his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funeral?
</em><br>
<p>Oh, you are referring to Reagan's amnesia. People close to him said
<br>
that he had died bit by bit in the preceding months or years. Which
<br>
makes perfect sense, given what we know.  What was being celebrated
<br>
was his whole life and his whole record, as you know. His deanimation was
<br>
just a convenient and very traditional point at which to &quot;celebrate&quot; his passing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I would still be interested in people answering these even though the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigger point to be made here is that polls are a poor way of determining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether something is true or correct.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  Otherwise I wouldn't spend a moment more debating you
<br>
about this.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  Sorry for losing my temper back there, but this exasperated me quite
<br>
a bit more than usual for some reason.
