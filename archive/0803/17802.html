</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thats an interesting thesis, but somewhat akin to saying, isn't it, that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA is aware since it contains the code necessary to generate me, given a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program to execute it. I dont think that information is akin to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally different processes.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I didn't mean to suggest that pi is conscious, just used it
<br>
as an example of structure hidden in noise - *if* the structures were
<br>
conscious (we can say they are computations rather than bitstrings)
<br>
they would not be any less conscious for the fact that they are
<br>
hidden.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, Clifford Pickover has speculated about this very idea:
<br>
<a href="http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/pimatrix.html">http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/pimatrix.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, if I were to swallow tetrodotoxin or some other neurotoxin, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would quickly die, but the fundamental structure of my brain would remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unchanged for some time. I dont think that 'I' would remain conscious until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my brain started to decay.
</em><br>
<p>No, because consciousness requires a series of states, not a single
<br>
state frozen in time. But I would argue that there need be no causal
<br>
connection between the states: as long they have the right structure,
<br>
you will experience continuity of consciousness. It's just that
<br>
usually the states aren't produced with the right structure unless
<br>
they are causally related.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; similarly, if I were to describe the position of every atom in my body with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a specific number, that number would not exhibit conscious in and of itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but even if it did, are all the possibly polymorphisms of that digit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious in precisely the same way? a reversal of the number, subjecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number to any one of several information-preserving compression
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithms, or reducing that number to its lowest possible KC value by some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means.
</em><br>
<p>Well, multiple realisability is a basic assumption of functionalism.
<br>
There is a mapping from computer A to computer B, so computer B is
<br>
performing the &quot;same&quot; computation as A. I see no basis for deciding
<br>
that some mappings, like the simple ones, are allowed while others are
<br>
not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Lets say though that somehow, an abstraction of my atomic structure/energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is sufficient for consciousness, that such structure is conscious in and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself. What if we were to create n clones of me, utilizing this abstraction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as input into a program, lets further say that such clones are implemented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a computer program, and all are subject to the same internal environment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lets also say that each clone is housed in a small computer, maybe 10cm x
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10cm x 10cm in size. its not important.  If we create several instantiations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of this program, several of these computers so to speak, and housed them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same building. would there only be one instantiation of consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given that its the same structure, even though each instantiation of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structure is not causally interactive with any of the others, or are there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple consciousnesses?
</em><br>
<p>There is effectively only one consciousness. The reason I say this is
<br>
that as long as there is at least one instantiation, it makes no
<br>
difference to it if other instantiations start or stop. Suppose there
<br>
are two copies of you, A1 and A2, running in perfect lockstep on
<br>
separate computers. You are *either* A1 *or* A2 at a particular
<br>
instant, but it is impossible for you to know which. If you are A1 and
<br>
A2 suddenly stops, you notice nothing unusual happening, since you
<br>
continue being implemented as A1. If you are A1 and A1 stops, you
<br>
notice nothing unusual happening, since you continue to be implemented
<br>
as A2. The latter may seem counterintuitive, but it is equivalent to
<br>
saying that if you went through a Star Trek type teleporter, you
<br>
wouldn't notice anything unusual happening (other than ending up
<br>
somewhere else).
