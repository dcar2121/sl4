<em>&gt; There appears to be a serious lack of communication between people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think we're doomed without FAI and the people who expect a diverse society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of AIs. It appears that the leading advocates of one outcome can't imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how anyone could believe the other outcome is possible. This appears to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a symptom of a serious failure of rationality somewhere. I wish I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lock the leaders of each side of this schism into a room and not let them
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out until they either reached agreement or came up with a clear explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of why they disagreed.
</em><br>
<p>There is a AI meetup run by Monica in the SF Bay area every other
<br>
weekend, and she's willing to have a debate between someone who thinks
<br>
we're doomed without FAI and someone who expects a diverse society of
<br>
AI's.  The next time slot is 9 days from now, which is March 16, 2008.
<br>
<p>I can take the doomed-without-FAI position.  Do we have a volunteer to
<br>
advocate a diverse society of AI's?  I want the announcement to be
<br>
sent a week in advance, so I need responses by March 9.
<br>
<p>I'm not claiming to be a leading advocate of anything, and I'm not
<br>
willing to be locked up until someone else is reasonable, but this
<br>
still seems worth doing.
<br>
<p>I'm expecting a format like around 10 minutes of stating a position
<br>
each, up to 10 minutes of rebuttals each, then random questions from
<br>
the crowd until we're out of questions or out of time.
