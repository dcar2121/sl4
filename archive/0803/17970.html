<em>&gt; &gt;  Of course this reduces to the problem of &quot;The Theory of Dust&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  we are right back to wondering how a pattern found in one cubic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  lightyear of dust, that appears to be Sa, could really be connected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  in any meaningful way with another pattern found in another cubic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  lightyear 10,000,000 parsecs away.  Again, I just don't think that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  all those patches of dust constitute consciousness (no information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  flow, no time involved).  A perfectly consistent position for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  time chauvinist like me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, it comes back to the same thing. I know I'm in a minority, but I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a problem with assuming that consciousness can happen with a succession
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of frozen states. The two reasons you give in your article for rejecting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious SFS are (a) that it's obviously absurd, and (b) that it doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result in information flow between the states. But I don't think it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously absurd, and I see the lack of information flow (or inability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle counterfactuals) as just making it impossible for us as external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observers to use the system for computation.
</em><br>
<p>Since we're bringing in mathematical isomorphisms between systems (via
<br>
the hash function and the game of life), let's consider a simpler
<br>
example: differentiating functions. Let S be some finite (though
<br>
possibly very large) set of polynomial functions, closed under
<br>
differentiation. The derivative is a map from S to itself. Via a hash
<br>
function f, this is then seen as an abstract map from f(S) to itself.
<br>
<p>Then what? Well, differentiation is connected with multiplication and
<br>
addition of functions. We can choose S to be sufficiently rich to have
<br>
many examples of this. Via f, we get some complicated relations on
<br>
f(S), and differentiation interacts with these relations (similaly,
<br>
localness can be phrased in terms of the image of the hash function;
<br>
it's just a lot more complicated).
<br>
<p>So far, I see no reason to consider that S and f(S) should be treated
<br>
differently. Sure its more complicated in f(S), but consciousness is
<br>
complicated anyway.
<br>
<p>I see only two ways of distinguishing S and f(S), and the equivalents
<br>
in the game of life: 1) The question asked and 2) The implicit
<br>
infinity.
<br>
<p>1) The question asked.
<br>
When you ask &quot;what is the derivative of this function&quot;, you are not
<br>
asking the equivalent (but hideously complicated) version in f(S). In
<br>
fact that hideously complicated question has no meaning unless we know
<br>
its simple equivalent. Similalrly, when we ask &quot;what is
<br>
consciousness&quot;, we expect the answer to have meaning, while the hash
<br>
function equivalent is meaningless.
<br>
<p>We can even formalise what we mean by meaning. &quot;What is consciousness&quot;
<br>
is a complicated question, but we know the outlines of the answer (and
<br>
it is not: the average wavelength of the light hitting Io during a
<br>
solar flare). The answer, whatever it is, will have simpler, quasi
<br>
answers - incomplete but informative. The has function equivalents
<br>
will not be simpler than the hash function equivalent to the full
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>2) The implicit infinity.
<br>
Implicit in the definition of differentiation is the fact that we
<br>
could differentiate any polynomial (with, say, rational coefficients).
<br>
The definition of differentiation to f(S) does not extend to infinity
<br>
in this way; in fact, there is no evident extention of f(S).
<br>
<p>So our definition of &quot;differentiation&quot; somehow covers an infinite
<br>
amount of cases, though it is defined finitely. A GLUT could not do
<br>
this.
<br>
