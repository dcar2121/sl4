<p>Lost memories make you a non-person.

<p>In the later stages of Alzheimer's disease the patient can no longer

look after their affairs. Someone is appointed to legally look after
<br>
their bank account, make decisions about their property,
<br>
accommodation, treatment, etc.
<br>
Legally and practically they are no longer a 'person' operating in
<br>
human society.
<br>
<p>Obviously this makes them very different from what they used to be.
