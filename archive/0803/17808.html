<p><em>&gt; &lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;}--&gt;While on this topic, I have to ask:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the lowest level level of complexity in life forms that you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assign consciousness and self-awareness?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mice? Ants? Mussels maybe?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also obviously impossible to answer objectively, but one has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try.....
</em><br>
<p>It depends on how you want to define consciousness and self awareness.  Does
<br>
an animal experience pain if you observe that it learns to avoid actions that
<br>
cause pain?  If so, then is autobliss.cpp conscious?
<br>
<a href="http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt">http://www.mattmahoney.net/autobliss.txt</a>
<br>
<p>Some people assert that consciousness requires awareness, specifically,
<br>
episodic memory.  For example, a  person whose hippocampus was removed would
<br>
forget events immediately after they happened, but could still learn skills. 
<br>
If such a person underwent surgery without anesthesia, he would not recall the
<br>
pain.  But because he still has procedural memory, he would experience anxiety
<br>
in the place where the torture occurred, without knowing why.  If I extended
<br>
autobliss to add episodic memory (it could recall the training sequence, and
<br>
recall instances of recalling it), would it be conscious?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's a practical question for me as it relates directly to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vegetarian but obviously has theoretical implications. Though I will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still choose not to eat meat as an exercise in compassion I would like to
</em><br>
hear
<br>
<em>&gt; some more educated views on the matter. My (uneducated) view on the matter
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; that it would be surprising if most insects were conscious because of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple brains and their great reliance on chemical signals on the blood flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for simple communication of information within the body. The same might hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for some of the smaller mammals. And I would say “no” for the mussels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but wouldn't I love to be surprised...... :)
</em><br>
<p>You are confusing consciousness with ethics.  It is in the best interest of
<br>
tribes to practice altruism to other tribe members.  Those tribes were more
<br>
successful than the anarchists, so we inherited their genes and culture.  This
<br>
doesn't mean such behavior is right, just that we believe it is right.  We say
<br>
we do not inflict pain on others because they are conscious like us and we
<br>
would not want them to inflict pain on us.  But that is just an excuse to
<br>
justify our beliefs, just like we make excuses to justify killing criminals or
<br>
enemies at war.
<br>
<p>Evolution does not favor compassion to other species.  Dogs and cats are
<br>
carnivores.  There is no moral dilemma for them.  But your question is
<br>
important.  We will try to apply the arguments that justify our ethics to
<br>
intelligent machines, and our logic will fail.  There is no right answer.
