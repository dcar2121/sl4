<p><em>&gt; I find it difficult to phrase my thoughts in words because I tend to think more in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pictures and analogy.
</em><br>
<p>Me too!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To give a more concrete (real &amp; not rhetorical) example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today on my way home I took a slightly different path than usual, yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after some meandering I found myself on a familiar road and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continued from that point along my usual route.  Suppose I make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar (yet each unique) small detours each day for a week.  After 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experiment you ask, &quot;How did you get from work to home?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but you do not provide the specific context of a particular day, or a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular travel method.  When I think of all the routes I had used,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are a superposition of valid solutions- and they're all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct solutions within the scope of the question.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If you ask the same question to both me and my wife, then I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think also of those routes she used to travel from her work to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our home.  I did not subjectively experience those routes in real-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail, but I am still capable of imagining them as solutions  to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentionally open-scoped question.  I don't think these 'imagined'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routes are difficult to include within the sphere of  possibility for how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did (or might have) get from work to home.  There might have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a route enter my mind's view of possible  routes that I had taken months
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before I started this experiment.  I believe that experience may or may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not have happened (a third-party might have told me how to imagine it)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is still worth some possibility of correctly answering the question.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The analogy works here because the question itself does [is] not limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by time - so each of those serialized events are presented simultaneously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as possible answers.  I believe subjective experience of run-time in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation environment where the observation of time can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manipulated by an external agent provides for a context switch,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several processing threads each deposit results into shared &quot;memory&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Ah.  Here you mean not only the computer science &quot;shared memory&quot;
<br>
but real human type shared memory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and a context switch back will appear to those inhabiting the suspended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment that the results of those independent threads have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computed instantly.
</em><br>
<p>That's not very clear, IMO.  With ordinary raw threads or processes
<br>
running on a computer, sure, one moment the process has access to
<br>
data structures X and Y, and the next, equal access to Z. But that
<br>
entirely ignores the knotty problem of how memories are added to
<br>
people, as you say &quot;instantly&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Normally each new experience you have is immediately compared
<br>
on some sort of salience measure to everything else that has ever
<br>
happened to you, i.e., to all your other memories. That's why you
<br>
are &quot;reminded&quot; of things, some of which happened a long time ago.
<br>
Now if you get enough new experiences, the new memories that
<br>
are generated are slowly integrated into all your existing ones.
<br>
The computer analogy seems a little strained here, at least with
<br>
the kinds of algorithms we have today running on our machines. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I have some proficiency with SQL as a visualization for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structured information / thoughts.  Recent discussion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GLUT makes me think of database concepts.  Given that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; database theory is essentially a scaled-down version of set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, would it be acceptable to represent (for discussion)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these ideas in set theory terms? 
</em><br>
<p>Well, I suppose so.  At least keep the provisos I suggested
<br>
above in mind (thanks) and be very skeptical of every step
<br>
you take, of course, to minimize the damage done to the
<br>
original questions.  But sure. After seeing Stuart Armstrong
<br>
successfully get away with modeling states of a TM (or
<br>
generations of a Life Board) with mere polynomials, and
<br>
state transitions as differentiation, I'm pretty willing to listen
<br>
to anything!
<br>
<p>Well, almost anything  :-)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (I admit to not having the rigid formalism of Set Theory available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a natural language, but might it be worth the effort?  Is that too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domain-specific to have anyone make the effort?)
