<em>&gt;&gt;  Anyway, I am a &quot;time chauvinist&quot;, and believe that our best physics theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and our best epistemology are grounded in the notion of *time*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  ...as having a child in Australia write &quot;2+2 =&quot; on a whiteboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  and coincidentally having a child in Hungary writing a &quot;4&quot; on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  a different whiteboard. So what if an &quot;answer&quot; pops up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  somewhere in the universe?  If there is no causal connection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  no information flow, then it amount to nothing at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It amounts to nothing because no-one can recognise it as a computation.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I assume (reading ahead) that whether or not someone recognizes it
<br>
is immaterial. Just to be sure, don't you believe that &quot;computationalness&quot;
<br>
like &quot;consciousness&quot; is independent of what outsiders observe or think about it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The causal connection is necessary to make it useful, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it isn't useful then we may as well say it isn't a computation at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all. I completely agree with this. But if the computation in question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gives rise to consciousness, it *doesn't matter* that no-one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognises it as a computation, since consciousness is not contingent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on an external observer.
</em><br>
<p>I quite agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we have a random system which, purely by chance, will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hidden somewhere within it the lottery numbers, so what? But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the random system has hidden within it processes corresponding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a mind, why should that mind be any less conscious for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that it is hidden from?
</em><br>
<p>Well, as I said earlier, first, I deny that anything truly random will
<br>
have anything at all of substance in it. To me, an almost random
<br>
system could indeed contain a conscious mind, so long as it was
<br>
not frozen in place, but was causally being computed from one
<br>
state to the next.

<p><em>&gt; The Monday/Tuesday example I gave before still works with classical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics. There is nothing in your subjective experience which can give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you a clue as to whether the implementations of the two days were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causally linked or just accidentally correlated. This is a consequence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the supervenience thesis in philosophy of mind: no change in mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state without a change in physical state.
