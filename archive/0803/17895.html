A great deal needs to be said here, but I'll just hit the high points.

</em><br>
<p>&quot;Subjective experience&quot; is an ill-defined concept (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/wrong-questions.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/wrong-questions.html</a>), and we
<br>
could argue about it for thousands of years and never get anywhere.
<br>
Isn't this exactly what philosophers have been doing, ever since the
<br>
days of ancient Greece?
<br>
<p>Your definition doesn't seem to be connected to the usual notion of
<br>
&quot;subjective experience&quot;. Everyone agrees that a five-line Python
<br>
program has no real capability for understanding, in the human sense
<br>
of the term, but it's easy to write a five-line program with a
<br>
positive Kolmogorov complexity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Motivation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Humans are said to have subjective experience, meaning that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  1. You can recall that X happened (episodic memory).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  2. After observing X, you assign a higher probability of observing X again in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the same context (procedural memory).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  3. If X has nonzero utility, you change your behavior to increase your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  utility, to seek or avoid X (reinforcement learning).
</em><br>
<p>A paperclip tiler, with no general intelligence whatsoever, can say as much.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  All of these result in a change in mental state.  On the other hand, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  were unconscious or someplace else when X happened, then none of these changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would have taken place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The existence of subjective experience has not been proven.
</em><br>
<p>There's no such thing as proof. See
<br>
<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/gray-fallacy.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/01/gray-fallacy.html</a>.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  For example, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  philosophical zombie is claimed to have no subjective experience but otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  behave identically to a human (e.g. say &quot;ouch&quot; but not feel pain).  However a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rationalist would reject this view because there is no test to distinguish a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  zombie from a human.
</em><br>
<p>This sounds like an eighteenth-century discussion of what air would be
<br>
like if you removed the phlogiston.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Assume humans have subjective experience.  This experience must occur in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  brain.  If you put a brain in a vat and stimulated its sensory nerves, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would experience a sensation.  If you replaced the neurons one at a time with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  equivalent functional devices (Chalmers' fading qualia argument), then there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  would be no change in behavior and presumably no loss of subjective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  experience.  If you replaced the brain with any equivalent Turing machine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (implementing the same function), then it must have subjective experience.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  we assume further that there are things that don't have subjective experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (for example, rocks or dead humans), then subjective experience must be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  nontrivial property of Turing machines.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Conditional Kolmogorov complexity is therefore one possible measure.
</em><br>
<p>K complexity is hardly a sufficient metric for nontrivial properties
<br>
of Turing machines! Consider all Turing machines with n or fewer
<br>
states acting on a blank tape. The number of possible Turing machines
<br>
increases with C^N, so the number of possible nontrivial properties of
<br>
Turing machines increases with C1^C2^N (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/superexp-concep.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/superexp-concep.html</a>). K
<br>
complexity, meanwhile, increases with N. The amount of information
<br>
conveyable with K goes with log(N); the amount of information needed
<br>
as a metric for an arbitrary nontrivial property goes with
<br>
log(C1^C2^N) = C^N.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  further motivation, consider experiencing two events, X and Y.  This will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  result in more to be recalled (greater complexity with respect to episodic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  memory), greater adjustment of probability (procedural memory) and greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  change in behavior (reinforcement).
</em><br>
<p>Your Kolmogorov-based definition doesn't account for any of these. A
<br>
five-line Python program has no episodic memory, procedural memory or
<br>
reinforcement mechanisms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Applications.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Some people believe that it is unethical to harm (kill or decrease utility of)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  agents that have subjective experience.  I do not take a position on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  issue, but if we assume it is true, then:
</em><br>
<p>Beware using one Really Great Idea to explain absolutely everything
<br>
(<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/affective-death.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/12/affective-death.html</a>). Human
<br>
morality is much more complex than this
<br>
(<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/thou-art-godsha.html">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/11/thou-art-godsha.html</a>).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  - Teleportation (making a copy of a person and destroying the original) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ethical because K(S2|S1) = 0 (no change in mental state).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Torture followed by reprogramming the brain to erase the memory of it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ethical for the same reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Killing animals to save humans is ethical because humans have bigger brains,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  and therefore a greater capacity for subjective experience.  (One could argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that killing humans for the benefit of superhuman intelligence is ethical for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the same reason).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - There is no subjective experience of death because K({}|S1) = 0.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  However, this ethical view also leads to the conclusion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  - Creating and then killing a person regardless of what happens in between is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  ethical because K({}|{}) = 0.  (But one could argue that killing is unethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  because of its negative utility on survivors).
</em><br>
<p>It's impossible to have negative K complexity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A data compression program like zip has subjective experience in all 3 modes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that humans do.  A compressor accepts a sequence of symbols from an unknown
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  source and has the task of predicting future symbols so that it can assign
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  shorter codes to the most likely symbols.  It has procedural memory because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  after each event (observing symbol X in some context), it raises the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  probability that X will occur next time the same context is observed.  It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  episodic memory because decompression recalls the exact sequence of events.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  It undergoes reinforcement learning with a utility function equal to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  negative of the length of the compressed output.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't studied compression algorithms extensively, but you seem to
<br>
be playing fast and loose with the idea of &quot;memory&quot; and &quot;utility
<br>
function&quot; here. Compression algorithms, so far as I know, have no
<br>
explicit utility functions, and at least one (LZW) has no explicit
<br>
representation of probability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  So even if you accept that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  only one mode of learning is required for subjective experience (say, episodic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  memory), then you have to conclude that if humans have subjective experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  then so do data compression programs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  The human brain has a capacity for subjective experience K(S2|{}) from birth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  between 10^9 bits (Landauer's estimate of long term memory, see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://www.merkle.com/humanMemory.html">http://www.merkle.com/humanMemory.html</a> ), and 10^15 bits (the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  synapses).
</em><br>
<p>There's a big distinction between K complexity and bits of memory in
<br>
the normal sense. Assuming that the universe is a closed
<br>
Turing-computable system, it cannot have a K complexity significantly
<br>
higher than the K complexity at the time of the Big Bang.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A data compression program together with its output could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  therefore have as much subjective experience as an adult human from birth if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  its input is large enough.
</em><br>
