<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But he said  it was right in front of him and that he did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand its architecture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>He also said no I/O, which was confusing since even the sight of it is some
<br>
sort of output. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt however and assume
<br>
that the aliens gave it some sort of input when they made it, enough to kick
<br>
start the simulation, and then left it, happy to have it simulating an apple
<br>
for all of eternity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However we still have to deal with Heisenberg. By tinkering with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or observing its insides are we disturbing the natural flow of its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; simulation of an apple?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That would be a real danger, all right. It could be so delicate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you say, it cannot be observed without changing it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>haha, not quite where I Was going with it...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If by observing its internal processes we cause different consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the simulated apple than we would with the real apple, I wonder if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it can still be said to be simulating an apple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question would be, &quot;how different are those consequences&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They could be sufficiently great so as to violate its &quot;apple nature&quot;, i.e
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would no longer be in the &quot;space&quot; of all apples. Under such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change, the device could no longer be said to be simulating an apple.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, if its a simulation, since part of what an apple is is the way it
<br>
interacts causally with the rest of the universe, any difference at all
<br>
invalidates the simulation.
<br>
<p>I can poke an apple, I can't poke this simulated apple. If I can devise some
<br>
means of poking this simulated apple, perhaps through applying current at
<br>
nodes x and y, then again, its not an inputless system.
<br>
<p>As well, even without poking, the device itself is actually accepting input
<br>
and giving output all the time. It is irrelevant whether we pay attention to
<br>
the output or not. It is no longer self contained. It may simulate an apple
<br>
through a logical mapping of all properties of a real-world apple to its
<br>
machine language, but the fact that we can observe such means we are
<br>
accepting some type of output from the system.  If it possible to accept
<br>
output from the system, we are able to input into the system.
<br>
<p>Its no longer a 'self-contained inputless system'.
<br>
<p>I would argue that there is no actual members of the class 'inputless
<br>
self-contained virtual environments' since, by being inputless, they can't
<br>
interact with the universe. And any other alternative allows an isomorphic
<br>
mapping of signals to simulate any arbitrary real universe action in the
<br>
natural language of the virtual environment.
<br>
<p>Rgds,
<br>
<p>Ross
