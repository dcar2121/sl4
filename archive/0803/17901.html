<p><em>&gt; - If 1000 copies of you are made in London lacking 50% of your

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I guess it depends on what part of your memories you use to identify your
<br>
Self  :)
<br>
<p>- You are offered two choices:
<br>
<em>&gt; (a) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paris. The Paris copy is tortured while the London copies are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) 100 copies of you are made in London and one copy is made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paris. After an hour, the 100 copies in London are tortured while the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copy in Paris is duplicated 100,000 times and none of these copies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is your subjective probability of being tortured at the moment of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original copying greater in (a) or (b)?
</em><br>
<p><p>How do we even measure the _degree_ of torture?  If I am to identify with
<br>
every copy as myself: scenario A divides my identity 101 ways and only one
<br>
is tortured (resulting in &lt;1% subjective torture, assuming the 100 London
<br>
copies are blissfully happy)  Scenario B has a division of my identity into
<br>
100,100 parts, with 100 being tortured (&lt;0.1% subjective torture)  So it
<br>
doesn't seem to matter that scenario B has 100 times as much torture in my
<br>
future because it is statistically overwhelmed by the greater number of
<br>
copies experiencing the Not-torture option.  I guess it become more
<br>
difficult to decide if each copy experiences varying degrees of torture in
<br>
their subjective futures, making the resulting best-choice calculation at
<br>
t=0 a tedious mess of prediction.  I would imagine there must be some
<br>
pruning feature to make the deep search of all possible branches less
<br>
computationally expensive by giving up early on those choices that require
<br>
too much work.  In that case, the greater number of copies in scenario B may
<br>
be less likely to be discovered within resource constraints because scenario
<br>
A appears to be more efficient to calculate.  Consider: &lt;1% chance of
<br>
torture that is 3 orders of magnitude less copies to consider than the
<br>
marginal 1 order of magnitude smaller chance at &lt;0.1%
<br>
<p>Note that there is no problem *objectively* describing what happens in
<br>
<em>&gt; any of these cases. Lee tries to take the objective point of view and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translate it into the subjective point of view as well. But to do this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would require a complete overthrow of our notions of anticipation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective probability, and I don't think this is possible without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewiring our brains.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I believe the rewiring our brains is part of the assumptions for this
<br>
thought experiment.  I assumed the greater &quot;run-time&quot; offered by many copies
<br>
was only really possible in either an uploaded consciousness situation or
<br>
some massively expanded awareness of multiple worlds.  In either case,
<br>
rewiring a brain would seem to be the easy part. :)
