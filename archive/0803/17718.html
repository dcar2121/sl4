<em>&gt;&gt; I dispute the can opener argument. You make the assumption that all of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 'signal' is contained inside the packaging, i.e. that all meaning of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; email is external to the email itself, and dependant upon cultural context.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But an extreme construal of that position implies that there is no objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; meaning,
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, sometimes there is objective meaning---sometimes not. There are two
<br>
cases. The first I call &quot;isomorphic meaning&quot;, and the second &quot;conventional meaning&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ...most serious logicians, even on the extreme externalist end of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; spectrum would concede that a signal has an internal logic.
</em><br>
<p>I would caution again: only *sometimes*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The position is somewhat akin to saying that if I create  a sequence such as:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; -.-.--.---.-----.--------.   etc
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that an alien intelligence could not possibly interpret it as a fibonacci
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sequence, since of course, all the meaning is contextually dependant.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that sequence has enough *isomorphic* meaning to be deciphered
<br>
by an enemy code breaker or an alien intelligence (assuming, as is only
<br>
reasonable to assume, that to be sufficiently intelligent is to be able to
<br>
&quot;see&quot; and figure out such sequences).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You would be relying on an evolved intelligence having at least some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarity with human intelligence, not an unreasonable assumption.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there is no reason why the written language of an alien species
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not be, for example, based on the radioactive decay pattern of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacred stone, in which case to us a message would look completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; random.
</em><br>
<p>But if they sent us one of their sacred stones, we would eventually
<br>
find the non-random redundant pattern in the radioactive decay....
<br>
Great example. We would find the pattern because it is objectively
<br>
there, and its Komolgorov complexity is less than that of a random
<br>
string. (Of course, after breaking the &quot;code&quot; we might still be 
<br>
totally baffled by *conventional* meaning embedded, such as
<br>
what &quot;jerryfooling up&quot; means to them, or that Xmaph is one of
<br>
their kings.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, an alien computer could seem to us completely random. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need not even be a causal connection between the subcomponents of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computation. A virtual environment in which you experience Monday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be run on computer A, and then Tuesday run on (completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different) computer B in the Andromeda galaxy a billion years later at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one billionth speed. As far as you're concerned, you experience Monday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed by Tuesday. You could be in a simulation in which every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second of experience is implemented on different hardware, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different rates, different physical locations, in no particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sequence, and you would have no way of knowing it. The shorter the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frames are, the more likely that a sequence of physical events
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isomorphic to whatever hardware/software combination you specify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arises by chance.
</em><br>
<p>Isn't this analogous to the code-maker's efforts to change frequencies
<br>
extremely often in order to thwart enemy decryption? But even in 
<br>
those cases, if there really is a pattern there, sooner or later others
<br>
break the code.
<br>
<p>(Naturally, there has to be *isomorphic* meaning in, say, a long 
<br>
passage.  No one can break the following code I just invented five
<br>
seconds ago that in a *convention* I just created five seconds
<br>
ago:  &quot;ACJXM  TBBCP  EHYSK QNLRZ&quot;
<br>
<p>But Krekoski's &quot;-.-.--.---.-----.--------.&quot; contains *isomorphic*
<br>
meaning.  Isomorphic, that is, to many extant real world structures,
<br>
and also isomorphic to rather rudimentary mathematical investigations.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. No one could have guessed that by &quot;ACJXM  TBBCP EHYSK
<br>
QNLRZ&quot;, I meant &quot;sticks hicks nix pix&quot;, which also happens to be laden
<br>
only with *conventional* meaning.
