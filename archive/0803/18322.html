<p><em>&gt;&gt;  But I still think that you'll have to aim higher  :-)  than V1 here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can go up as high as you feel is necessary. You suggested that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1000x1000 patch of the Board that was looked up rather than calculated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might cause a small deficit in consciousness. If that's not enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then imagine that half the Board is looked up and the other half
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculated: surely that should be noticeable?
</em><br>
<p>Noticeable to whom?  Here is what I think is going on: *naturally*,
<br>
the subject, the person who's supposed to be having experiences,
<br>
can report nothing different than what he would report anyway.
<br>
All the states that his brain would have reached (under what I call
<br>
&quot;totally authentic computation&quot;) would still be reached. So in a
<br>
certain sense, he *doesn't* notice any difference.
<br>
<p>But in another sense he does.  But first, our entire hypothesis depends
<br>
on the agencies running the experiment to be perfectly aware of when
<br>
his brain states are being looked up, and when they're being computed
<br>
by the usual routes of causality and local reductionism. 
<br>
<p>Now, let me phrase my answer using an experiment so that there is
<br>
no mistaking my meaning.  Question:  would you prefer
<br>
<p>(A)  to be tortured for an hour in the old-fashioned way
<br>
<p>(B)  for records of such an hour merely to be retrieved from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a galaxy far, far away a long time ago in which you were
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tortured just the same, and merely the states for that hour
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interval brough to Earth and at the proper moment merely
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked up?
<br>
<p>I would far, far prefer option B, even though afterwards I
<br>
would remember them equally well (and hideously) whichever
<br>
I chose. Would you really have the fortitude to say &quot;I'm indifferent
<br>
concerning A and B&quot;?
<br>
<p>In other words, if half my states over a period T are looked up,
<br>
and the other half thereby properly calculated, then the misery
<br>
or pleasure I get during T is thereby halved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  I think that Chalmers almost by definition can never find what he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  is looking for, because any explanation would fail to satisfy him
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  either for one reason, or if that doesn't work, then a new one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  I'm afraid that an explanation would have to *make* Chalmers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  feel conscious, or feel an experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  Extremely hypothetical guess:  if you took the set of all 26^500
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  explanations of 500 characters in length, not one of them would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  satisfy those who insist that there is an insoluble  mystery to the matter.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The quoted paper has nothing whatsoever to do with the &quot;hard problem&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (if that's what you were referring to). It is an argument that, whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness may be, it should be possible to generate it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a suitably configured non-biological substrate.
</em><br>
<p>Anyone who's for uploading is clearly already on-board to this point
<br>
of view.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only (naturalistic) way to avoid this conclusion is if the brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains fundamentally non-computable physics, and there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence that it does.
</em><br>
<p>Just so. I would be surprised if this were at all controversial between
<br>
you and me, or between us and our favorite correspondents.
