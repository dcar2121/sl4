</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'll try to restate the problem to eliminate explicit mention of
<br>
observers from it, until after the solution is found. I assume your
<br>
main issue with it will revolve around what &quot;anticipate&quot; actually
<br>
means. If you still have problem with it, please explain what
<br>
anticipation is, why is it different from probability and what it is
<br>
for.
<br>
<p>Say, there is a box with a sphere in it. We now will do one of two
<br>
possible things, with 50% chance of doing either:
<br>
- in first case, we toss a red cube in it;
<br>
- in second case, we toss in it a green cube and 99 spheres identical
<br>
to the one that is already in the box.
<br>
<p>What is the probability of finding a green cube in a box, if I tell
<br>
you that in this particular outcome there is also at least one sphere
<br>
in it? The same as just finding a green cube, 50%. And I know that
<br>
there is at least one sphere in the box, thank you very much, there is
<br>
at least one in each case.
<br>
<p>Now, in the second experiment, we start with the same original
<br>
setting, one sphere in the box, and with 50-50 chance we now do one of
<br>
two following things:
<br>
- in first case, we toss a red cube in it;
<br>
- in second case, we toss in it a green cube, and additionally with
<br>
90% probability we remove a sphere from the box.
<br>
<p>What is the probability of finding a green cube in a box, if I tell
<br>
you that in this particular outcome there is also at least one sphere
<br>
in it? Now this information about the presence of sphere is useful,
<br>
because in some outcomes in second cases there isn't one, it gets
<br>
removed.
<br>
Probability of finding a green cube is 50%, and of these 50% only in
<br>
0.5*0.1=0.05 of cases have a sphere, of total 0.5+0.05 of cases having
<br>
a sphere, so probability of finding a green cube is 1/11.
<br>
<p>And, by the way, you are a remotely controlled robot whose mind is
<br>
implemented by a computer running inside one of those spheres, I won't
<br>
tell you which one. Lucky you there was at least one sphere after the
<br>
experiment.
