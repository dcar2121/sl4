<p>
Toby,
<br>
<p>I was walking down the street about 6 months ago and bumped into an old
<br>
friend from my childhood.  Even though our meeting was by chance, we
<br>
took the opportunity to catch up.  It turns out we've become good
<br>
friends again and have also supported each other as colleagues.  
<br>
<p>Should we have turned the other way because there was no higher
<br>
explanation for our meeting again?  Instead of choosing this avenue, we
<br>
seized the opportunity to inject meaning into a chance encounter.  We
<br>
chose to generate meaning at that cusp, where the default outcome would
<br>
have been zero.
<br>
<p>But I suppose that my entire anecdote is completely meaningless if you
<br>
require all meaning to derive from a singular root, because there always
<br>
has to be a higher source of meaning to bootstrap that &quot;root&quot;.  It looks
<br>
like turtles all the way down!  
<br>
<p>Ha... can't have that.  Therefore, there must be no point at all.
<br>
<p>But wait!  What if that root meaning could indeed bootstrap itself?
<br>
What if meaning could somehow weave itself into existing, out of a bunch
<br>
of stuff that was, on its own, devoid of meaning.  What might that look
<br>
like?
<br>
<p>Perhaps it would look a whole lot like evolution, as the entire chain of
<br>
events leading to this exact moment.  
<br>
<p>And finding oneself embedded and aware within such a landscape, an
<br>
expansive plateau of meaninglessness exhibiting embryonic sparks and
<br>
isolated pockets of meaning, what greater source of meta-meaning could
<br>
there be than to fan those sparks into flames?  
<br>
<p>If the meaning we're supposed to find in our everyday lives is to come
<br>
from outside the system somewhere, then I cry foul.  It just pushes the
<br>
problem elsewhere; pushes meaning behind an impenetrable curtain of
<br>
unknowability.  I don't know how to make existence more meaningless and
<br>
arbitrary than by doing just that.
<br>
<p>But if instead, meaning is something we contruct, something that *must*
<br>
be constructed to exist at all, then we all bear a deep responsibility
<br>
for tending that most delicate and uncertain spark.  Meaning becomes
<br>
bound to our collective existence, whether we like it or not.  We can
<br>
grow up and engage that responsibility, exploring the potential depths
<br>
of meaning, or we can bask in the relative bliss of our current
<br>
position.
<br>
<p>Either way, if the above is true, one thing is for certain.  If we don't
<br>
project the meaning we *can* find into our collective future, then it
<br>
will be smothered still-born in the womb.
<br>
<p>The Fermi paradox isn't an outcome.  It is a challenge to be remedied.
<br>
<p>-Chris Healey

Subject: Re: Existential Risk and Fermi's Paradox
<br>
<p>This is my rather depressing take on the Fermi
<br>
Paradox.
<br>
There is no point in anything.
<br>
<p>We humans are programmed/evolved to make sense out of
<br>
the environment, so we find it hard to accept that
<br>
large complex artefacts, like the universe for
<br>
example, are pointless. This has allowed us to
<br>
confabulate higher meanings that keep us going.
<br>
<p>But if a truly rational being accepts that there is no
<br>
creator/mysticism/purpose then what is the point? 
<br>
Evolution generates its own purpose; survival. But a
<br>
rational being will not be able to deceive itself for
<br>
long if the universe really is devoid of higher
<br>
purpose.
<br>
These minds will euthanize leaving nothing behind.
<br>
<p>This may be a view in common circulation. Ian M Banks
<br>
touches on the idea in one of his books when he
<br>
describes a clean AI free of any of the &quot;noise&quot; of the
<br>
creating species. These AIs always sublime
<br>
immediately.
