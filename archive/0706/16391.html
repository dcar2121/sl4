<p>&quot;My point is these are all arbitrary, all of our most fundamental drives are just almost vestigial relics from our evolutionary upbringing.&quot;
<br>
<p>Why does it matter where these &quot;fundamental drives&quot; come from?  Would it somehow be better or less arbitrary if they were imposed upon us by some sort of external supermind?  Does anything exist that *cannot* be somehow classified as arbitrary?
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that examining and understanding the origins and development of various drives is uninteresting or pointless, but rather that &quot;arbitrary&quot; is something of a red-herring designation.  If something turns out to be useful and/or interesting, why should it matter whether it is &quot;merely vestigial&quot; or not? 
<br>
<p>&quot;Of course this AI could choose to be enthralled by anything, but why would it, if it knew it was all built on sand?&quot;
<br>
<p>For the same reason that clinically depressed people might take antidepressants if they start feeling a lack of interest in everyday or previously-pleasurable activities.  Existence is full of stuff, and while you may wish to term this observation &quot;arbitrary&quot; as well, I think that conscious awareness and the ability to process information about all this &quot;stuff&quot; is, at the very least, a phenomenon of tremendous potential.  
<br>
<p>To suggest that a &quot;chosen&quot; sense of enthrallment is somehow &quot;built on sand&quot; is nonsensical, because it makes the (fallacious, in my mind) assumption that nothing is actually interesting -- that the universe is fundamentally boring if you are sufficiently smart or well-informed.  Perhaps a property of advanced intelligence *is* the ability to recognize things that are complex and closer to being &quot;objectively interesting&quot; and tune one's motivational circuits to respond to these things.  
<br>
<p>Note also, though that I am not one who believes that personal survival (and therefore the &quot;need&quot; to come up with motivations to continue) necessarily needs to be incorporated as a &quot;meta-goal&quot; in order for an entity or AI not to destroy itself; if the AI lacks the desire to NOT exist, there is no reason to assume it would choose oblivion.
