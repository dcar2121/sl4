<p><em>&gt; When the technological singularity comes, cars will have an infinite

</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance is no guarantee of future results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for razors and tailpipes, perhaps it may be for microprocessors.
</em><br>
<p>Leonard is apparently referring to a humor piece in the March 16th 2006
<br>
issue of The Economist, &quot;More blades good.&quot; Here's a response from Ray
<br>
Kurzweil that may clarify this issue. - Amara D. Angelica, editor,
<br>
KurzweilAI.net
<br>
<p>&quot;Exponentials continue if there is (1) a benefit or reason for it
<br>
continuing, (2) the resources for it to continue, and (3) a mechanism for it
<br>
to continue.  Rabbits in Australia expand exponentially until they run out
<br>
of resources (foliage).  Razor blades expand as long as there is a market
<br>
benefit that provides the mechanism.  Information technology will continue
<br>
to expand as long as these three factors enable its expansion.  I analyze
<br>
the resources for continued expansion of computation in chapter 3 of The
<br>
Singularity is Near.  
<br>
<p>&quot;There ARE limits but they are not very limiting. Based on what we know
<br>
about the physics of computation, the amount of matter and energy required
<br>
to compute are not zero, but vanishingly small.  The ultimate limits of
<br>
computation would permit one gram of matter to be trillions of trillions of
<br>
times more powerful than the computation required to simulate all several
<br>
hundred regions of the human brain, based on the most conservative estimates
<br>
of the amount of computation required.  One cubic inch of nanotube
<br>
circuitry, a type of circuitry that aleady works in experiments, would
<br>
ultimately be 100 million times more powerful than the human brain.  So the
<br>
resources ARE a limitation but will not kick in until vast levels are
<br>
achieved.  There is a clear benefit from continued expansion as more
<br>
powerful, more intelligent, more capable information technology always
<br>
eclipses the prior generation.  And the mechanism is that more powerful
<br>
information technology allows the design of the next generation.
<br>
<p>&quot;We will get to the point where the latest generation of information
<br>
technology will design its own next generation.  We also find that as one
<br>
particular paradigm in information technology runs of steam, it creates
<br>
research pressure for the next.  In the 1950's, they were shrinking vacuum
<br>
tubes to keep the exponential growth of the price-performance of computing
<br>
going, and that approach ran out of steam when they could no longer shrink
<br>
the size of the vacuum tubes and keep the vacuum.  This gave rise to the
<br>
fourth paradigm: transistors.  Moore's law, which pertains to the shrinking
<br>
of features on a (flat) integrated circuit, was not the first, but the fifth
<br>
paradigm to bring exponential growth to computing.  We have had smooth
<br>
doubly exponential growth of the price-performance of computing for over a
<br>
century, going back to the data processing equipment used in the 1890
<br>
census, the first American census to be automated.  
<br>
<p>&quot;When we run out of steam with Moore's law, we will go to the sixth
<br>
paradigm, three-dimensional molecular computing, which is already beginning
<br>
to work in laboratories.  We won't need this sixth paradigm until about
<br>
2020.  
<br>
<p>&quot;None of these factors pertain to razor blades or tail pipes.&quot;
