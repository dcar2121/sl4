<p>
Firstly I myself do not feel that life is pointless,
<br>
apart from all the other wonders I enjoy, I have two
<br>
boys and they would be meaning enough for me on their
<br>
own.
<br>
I was not trying to make a nihilist point:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't find this depressing at all... the universe
</em><br>
doesn't come with
<br>
<em>&gt; an inherent point, it simply is. We bring the
</em><br>
meaning, we invent 
<br>
<em>&gt;the reasons, we create the point. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't find this universe depressing either, but then
<br>
I am riddled with behaviours bestowed upon me by
<br>
evolution designed to keep me fit and happy enough to
<br>
have grand children. These are my hard wired meanings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Your desire for a point is as pointless as your
</em><br>
desire for survival. 
<br>
<em>&gt;Nihilism is not a moral philosophy which leads to
</em><br>
suicide, it is a 
<br>
<em>&gt;philosophy without moral direction at all. Minds are
</em><br>
machines, 
<br>
<em>&gt;and machines do not need a purpose in order to
</em><br>
function.
<br>
<p>Yes they are both arbitrary evolutionary hangovers. So
<br>
why would some hard core post singularity AI choose
<br>
either as a  reason to live? 
<br>
I do it for the beauty of the world and for my kids.
<br>
But this AI who can edit vis own mind and choose any
<br>
arbitrary configuration of &quot;noise&quot; (by this I mean the
<br>
idiosyncratic, irrational, *human* quirks that give
<br>
life meaning) must choose some set over another... So
<br>
which will ve choose?
<br>
None is not an option because even survival is an
<br>
arbitrary goal.
<br>
Hedonism: will lead to a self stimulating wire head
<br>
civilisation. I grant this is possible... but equally
<br>
depressing (and undetectable).
<br>
<p>Exploration, expansion: We can conceive of an AI /
<br>
civilisation that understands the fundamental laws of
<br>
physics. All permutations of these laws might still be
<br>
hidden due to chaos, but still, even the most
<br>
beautiful complex life forms or wonders of geology
<br>
would be like random rude phrases spat out of a random
<br>
sentence generator. A child would eventually get bored
<br>
of the latter and I maintain a god like AI would
<br>
quickly get bored of the former. So why explore? I
<br>
stress again I am not bored of these inspiring,
<br>
fascinating flukes, but I am a relatively simple
<br>
intellect.
<br>
<p>My point is these are all arbitrary, all of our most
<br>
fundamental drives are just almost vestigial relics
<br>
from our evolutionary upbringing. Of course this AI
<br>
could choose to be enthralled by anything, but why
<br>
would it, if it knew it was all built on sand?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Either way, if the above is true, one thing is for
</em><br>
certain.  If we don't
<br>
<em>&gt;project the meaning we *can* find into our collective
</em><br>
future, then it
<br>
<em>&gt;will be smothered still-born in the womb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Fermi paradox isn't an outcome.  It is a
</em><br>
challenge to be &gt;remedied.
<br>
<p>I totally agree with this. I hope we can find a
<br>
satisfactory purpose. 
<br>
But back to the original point, for them to be visible
<br>
to us in the universe this meaning would have to be
<br>
fascinating enough to keep a civilisation going for
<br>
millions of years. That is one hell of a hobby :)
