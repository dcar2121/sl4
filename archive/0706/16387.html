I don't find this depressing at all... the universe doesn't come with an 
<br>
inherent point,
<br>
it simply is. We bring the meaning, we invent the reasons, we create the 
<br>
point. The
<br>
power to &quot;BE&quot;, is remembering you are the source of all the points in 
<br>
your life, and
<br>
that when they no longer serve, you're responsible for creating new ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;We humans are programmed/evolved to make sense out of

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The problem is that the moment we begin to believe our confabulations, 
<br>
they have
<br>
us not the other way around. When you can accept that much of life is 
<br>
little more
<br>
than a likely story, and it's up to you to ferret out the interesting 
<br>
bits through what
<br>
wit or grace you have at your disposal... life become a brilliant 
<br>
mystery, a puzzle,
<br>
a prize to be taken. There is nothing sad or depressing about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But if a truly rational being accepts that there is no
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;Evolution generates its own purpose; survival. But a

This is the failure of the existentialists. Life is empty and 
<br>
meaningless... of course
<br>
in their existential angst and horror, they siezed up in terror and 
<br>
never finished the
<br>
sentence... Life is empty and meaningless, and it's empty and 
<br>
meaningless that
<br>
it's empty and meaningless. This isn't a horror... it's a puchline. The 
<br>
cosmic joke.
<br>
Each of us is responsible for the mythos of our existence. The minute 
<br>
you are
<br>
clear that it's a mythos, then your free to create anything you please. 
<br>
Why live
<br>
in a world of disempowering contexts? You brought the meaning with you,
<br>
why not be responsible for inventing empowering meanings and context? If in
<br>
fact you live in an invented universe, what do you choose to invent?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This may be a view in common circulation. Ian M Banks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;touches on the idea in one of his books when he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;describes a clean AI free of any of the &quot;noise&quot; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;creating species. These AIs always sublime
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immediately.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;LLbster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
We need to stop heaping human attributes onto something that will probably
<br>
very unlike us. An AI might not have any problem at all with the context of
<br>
reality. Without a bunch of evolutionary hardwiring desperately trying 
<br>
to get
<br>
one more iota of survival value out of the local space-time, an AI might be
<br>
very comfortable in a universe that had no reason, or beginning or end, or
<br>
even a universe that served no fundamental purpose... you can hear the
<br>
centuries of Gregorian Propaganda gnashing it's teeth on the very thought.
<br>
<p>We are inherently noisy. We add to that by becoming enamoured with our
<br>
noise, like our noise has some intrisc truth or value in it. All there 
<br>
is, is to take
<br>
a big step back, notice our prejudices, own them, and then get out of their
<br>
way. Of what value would it be to create a being just like us? How banal,
<br>
how small minded. If I'm going to jump on the evolutionary bandwagon, I
<br>
want to take a flying leap not fumbling baby step.
<br>
<p>Of course this is the discomfort you have with Fermi's Paradox... By all
<br>
means, if you see something I don't please share it with me.
