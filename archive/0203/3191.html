Subject: Re: Hardware Progress: $397 (fwd)
<br>
<p>A couple of years ago I stared at Intel's historical price
<br>
and performance numbers numbers until I started to hallucinate
<br>
and believe that I saw some patterns there. I did a few
<br>
calculations, some of which many of y'all might find
<br>
interesting. I put it up at
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.drzyzgula.org/aicpd.pdf">http://www.drzyzgula.org/aicpd.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>A couple of notes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* I pretty much just use an arbitrary 18-month Moore's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law doubling time without much comment. However, I had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sufficient data to float this doubling rate and have the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least squares pick it for each pricing level from $150
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to $800. When I did this, the doubling period was more
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like, IIRC, 15-17 months. Interestingly, although not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surprisingly, the doubling period was shorter for less
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expensive processors. As a result, the model showed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faster (in the SPECint sense) processors ultimately
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being less expensive than slower processors. To some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extent, this makes some sense in that really expensive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x86 processors tend to have larger caches which drive
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the price without adding to CPU speed. This doubling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skew was a hassle for the rest of the paper, however,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I fixed it a single value across all pricing levels.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried a 16 month period, but it didn't change the result,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I went back to 18 months because the economists I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was trying to reach were more familiar with the 18 month
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mythology.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* I wrote this paper for internal use at my office.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it's not sensitive or anything, I probably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have done a bit better job with references and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such if I had planned on publishing it. A large portion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the data was collected by Micro Design Resources
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and/or the SPEC consortium.  I supplemented this through
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other numbers I pulled off the web from things like
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Chip Directory and Intel's press releases. This
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all should have been credited.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* Internally, I had an appendix that contained all the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers and the Octave program I used to do the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calculations. This appendix isn't available because much
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the data collection is copyrighted. However, if anyone
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is really interested in playing with it -- or especially
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updating it -- let me know and I'll see what I can do.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;* I'm not a statistician. This isn't my area of expertise,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so there could be some egregious errors. I had some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;real statisticians read it, though, and they didn't
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barf or anything. Still, if anyone spots anything
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suspicious feel free to let me know.
