<em>&gt;You're wrong. If you can do an upload, the resources required dwarf that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;could use a telepresence puppet.
</em><br>
<p>The puppet might have trouble pacing the thinking speed of an upload.  Even 
<br>
diamond is likely not capable of, say, jogging at one million times the 
<br>
speed of a human body.
<br>
<p>I've seen a procedure for copying one neuron at a time into a computer, but 
<br>
not for producing the proper 'inputs'.  It's difficult as it stands for us 
<br>
to 'crack', say, the format in which Microsoft encodes their  Word 
<br>
documents, a format that was written by human beings.  Figuring out the 
<br>
exact pattern of impulses associated with, say, looking at the Mona Lisa 
<br>
with both eyes might be more difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; a problem, but &quot;what if the rest of my life is like this?&quot; would be, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Whole point of an upload is self modification, driven by adaptation and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I can't help thinking about the perspective of myself, a college sophomore 
<br>
living in a dormitory and learning to be a professional computer 
<br>
scientist.  I can understand how intuitively grasping code, and making no 
<br>
errors from forgetfullness, could make me a much more efficient programmer; 
<br>
I can't really understand what it would be like to be able to input a 
<br>
shockwave movie, for example, as a bit stream and immediately know how it 
<br>
was laid out, and exactly what bit pattern produced the anvil hitting Daffy 
<br>
Duck on the head, and which other produced his scream in stereo.
<br>
<p>I suppose I'd become inhuman in a matter of time, but I don't know how much 
<br>
time it would take.  Understanding things more efficiently would definately 
<br>
help, and I wonder how much time I would have for human thought if I were 
<br>
constantly busy calculating, for example, the exact hyperbolic tangent of 
<br>
the angles of every pair of blades of grass I passed, and aware of doing so.
