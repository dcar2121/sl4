<p>
<em>&gt; When the intelligence exceeds some threshold (roughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the upper human level) then it will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redefine all previous contexts. Even humans can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this at their low level of intelligence. Saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI can't is tantamount to saying it hasn't achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly transhuman intelligence. It's naive to think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the AI will not come up with its own definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of what it wants. By definition being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly-transhuman intelligence gives it the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'see through' all attempted hardwiring. It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overcome any unnecessarily narrow definitions and give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself more optimal ones. It will have the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sets its own supergoals and decide for itself what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desirable. There is no programming trick that will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent this.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although AI will be crafty, there's no need to ascribe it
<br>
godlike or supernatural powers. There may be an unlimited number of ways
<br>
to prevent it. Imagine you could ask an SI for such a programming trick.
<br>
Could it find one?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot control your own heartbeat - there's no reason to
<br>
assume that machine intelligence cannot have (or be purposely built
<br>
with) limitations.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 	Consider humans and procreation. The only purpose of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans (or any evolved biological organism) is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procreate. This ability to replicate and survive is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what started life.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life did not begin as the result of replication and survival.
<br>
Those follow the first organism. This is a boundary condition problem
<br>
that is related to the fact that evolution does not (and cannot) explain
<br>
the origin of life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We are life's most advanced achievement on earth.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a blanket statement, I disagree. What are your criteria?
<br>
Number? Ants and beetles win hands down. Longevity? Individually, trees
<br>
outlive us, and many species have remained essentially unchanged for
<br>
tens to hundreds of millions of years. Complexity? Insects accomplish
<br>
much with far less mass. Mantis shrimp have vision with ten color bases
<br>
(to our three) and so on. Meme infection? I believe bacteria do more
<br>
interesting things than think, and the long term effects of being a meme
<br>
carrier are largely unknown.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That humans use and carry memes so well, and are alone in that
<br>
on a planet of billions of species (perhaps trillions over the last
<br>
billion years) is evidence that intelligence is not a survival trait.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  And yet many people today choose NOT to procreate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They have changed their basic goal. Some see their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bloodlines terminate as a result favoring other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples genes at the expense of their own. Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealthy western nations are seeing their populations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decrease as people opt out from procreating. Their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA's only goal has been pre-empted, overturned. The
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 'goal' of the DNA is unchanged. It had no goal, of course,
<br>
though you could semantically argue that its goal is survival through
<br>
replication.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans behave irrationally (as far as their biology and their
<br>
DNA is concerned) because they carry a second replicator, the memes.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; point is that intelligence has the ability to change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the built-in definition of what an entity was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; originally programmed to desire. The same will be true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any AI of high intelligence no matter how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentally built-in its goal system is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how you could ever even come close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guaranteeing that a super-intelligent AI's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supergoal will be friendly. And you can't seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that any human is going to constrain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-intelligent AI's ultimate goal algorithm by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling its seed.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is excruciating, and I imagine it's why Eliezer has
<br>
devoted his talents to Friendliness first, before trying to build a
<br>
device that would get out of control. Can't speak for him.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Your best hope is that super-intelligence is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlated with friendliness to humans and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; orthogonal or anti-correlated.  Correlated basically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that being friendly to humans is the intelligent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing to do. The worst case scenario is that it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-correlated.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In which case...?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artificial intelligence occurs when memes supercede human
<br>
hardware; they will create a device for survival and replication
<br>
superior to us. It's not for our good, it's for the memes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, we may have to decide who's in charge, a decision
<br>
that saddens me. Sometimes I feel like a lifeless rock on a cooling
<br>
world, that's about to be overcome by seas of green algae, and grass.
