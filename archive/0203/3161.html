<p>
Speaking of Vernor Vinge, I've just placed an order for Vinge's new revised
<br>
and expanded book &quot;True Names and the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier&quot;
<br>
that includes essays by various authors in addition to Vinge's classic
<br>
novella of the title. The book missed its original publication deadline by
<br>
about a year. I wonder if this is one of the &quot;other projects&quot; he was
<br>
referring to, Damien.
<br>
<p>I also understand why you wanted to avoid going with an academic press.
<br>
American chain bookstores are now owned by conglomerates, not the old-line
<br>
people who loved books, and stores like Waldenbooks refuse to stock or even
<br>
special-order any titles from academic presses. At least there is
<br>
Amazon.com, which is the salvation of book-lovers such as myself who live in
<br>
small cities in remote parts of North America.

<p>Partly out of deference to Vernor Vinge, since I thought he might wish to
<br>
write the definitive scholarly book on his construct and I didn't wish to
<br>
steal the obvious title out from under him. Since then I've suggested to
<br>
him an anthology of the most important papers on the topic, under that
<br>
title, but Vernor wasn't interested, explaining that he had too many other
<br>
pressing projects. Maybe I'll do it myself if someone doesn't beat me to
<br>
it. (You can't imagine how difficult it is to sell this sort of marginal
<br>
thing from distant Oz; even with email, you might as well be on Pluto as
<br>
far as most US publishers are concerned. I could sell it to an academic
<br>
press *in Australia*, but then that tends to kill it for outside Oz, and
<br>
the American book distribution system is curiously resistant to handling
<br>
books sourced from elsewhere.)
