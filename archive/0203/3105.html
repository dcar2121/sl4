Hi all,
<br>
<p>I mentioned a week ago that I had an idea for how to mathematically
<br>
formalize the different levels of self-modifiability that I had informally
<br>
presented.
<br>
<p>Well, I haven't had time to do a totally rigorous mathematical treatment,
<br>
but I don't know when I'll have that kind of time to devote to something
<br>
that isn't Novamente engineering.
<br>
<p>However, I have written up a semi-mathematical paper, the last section of
<br>
which gives a formalization of the self-modifiability levels.  The previous
<br>
parts of the paper give formal definitions for things like &quot;intelligence&quot;
<br>
and &quot;mind&quot;, some of which are needed for the self-modifiability definitions.
<br>
<p>I also describe herein one &quot;AI proof of principle&quot; -- a design for an
<br>
insanely inefficient AI system that would be intelligent if it could be run
<br>
on a powerful enough computer.  This idea is close to the theory of
<br>
Solomonoff Induction.
<br>
<p>Please note, this little article is NOT directly related to the Novamente AI
<br>
system.  It gives some formalizations that have been useful to me in
<br>
thinking about Novamente, but only in a very general sense.  The &quot;AI proof
<br>
of principle&quot; described in the article has very little to do with Novamente,
<br>
which is tremendously more complex and more efficient (it's a real AI design
<br>
not a proof of principle).
<br>
<p>As an aside, however: The formal definition of pattern given in the paper
<br>
*is* used in Novamente in a couple of places (the system tries to
<br>
evolve/infer schema and compound relationships that are &quot;patterns&quot; in the
<br>
formal sense given here).
<br>
<p>Constructive feedback will be much appreciated.
<br>
<p>I know the definitions given here are not at all practical to compute.  They
<br>
are also sufficiently complex that proving anything nontrivial about them
<br>
would be a huge pain. So I think their main role is conceptual.
<br>
<p>The paper is at
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.goertzel.org/dynapsyc/2002/FormalTheoryIntelligence.htm
<br>
<p>I tried to proofread all the equations, but I tend to be poor at this, so
<br>
it's possible there are a couple notational slip-ups in here..
<br>
