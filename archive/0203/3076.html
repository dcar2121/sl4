&nbsp;&nbsp;Being more of a math person, Chatin is one of my personal heroes.  And I
<br>
really like the quote!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a somewhat relevant and very interesting transcript of a talk
<br>
he once gave at CMU about the limits of mathematics...  Wish I could find
<br>
the link.

<em>&gt; 	I was reading the book “Conversations with a Mathematician” by algorithmic
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; passage:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	“[M]y personal opinion is that AI is not a mathematical problem, it’s an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering problem….  To me a human being is just a very complicated piece
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of engineering that’s exquisitely well-suited for surviving in this world….
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	“[I]t’s very often the case that theoreticians can show that in theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there’s no way to solve a problem, but software engineers can find a clever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithm that usually works, or that usually gives you a good approximation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a reasonable amount of time.  And I think that human intelligence is also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a little bit like that, and that it’s a matter of creeping up on it little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by little, a step at a time, until we can usually do a good job imitating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	“In fact I think that we may be almost halfway there, only we don’t realize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and that fifty years from now we’ll be close to a real AI, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will wonder why anyone ever thought that it was difficult to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an AI.  This AI won’t be the result of a theorem, it’ll be a mountain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work, a giant engineering project that was built piece by piece, little by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little, just like what happens in Nature.  As the biologists say, God is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tinkerer, he cobbles things together, he patches things up, he makes do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what he has to create new forms of life by experimenting with sloppy little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes one step at a time….
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	“We humans aren’t artistic masterpieces of design, we’re patched together,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit by bit, and retouched every time that there’s an emergency and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design has to be changed!  We’re strange, awkward creatures, but it all sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of works!  And I think that an AI is also going to be like that….
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	“[A] working AI is going to be like some kind of Frankenstein monster that’
</em><br>
<em>&gt; s patched together bit by bit until one day we realize that the monster sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of works, that it’s finally intelligent enough! “
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	I think he overstates the case a little bit.  There is a kind of elegance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and order to complex adaptive systems with emergent behavior, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from the elegance and order in modern mathematics.  But still, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like his articulation of a point that has always seemed to me a piece of “AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common sense,” but that yet seems to elude most academic AI theorists.
