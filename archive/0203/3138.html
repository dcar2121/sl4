<p>Early uploads will be s l o w. Last time I looked the slowdown was at
<br>
least three orders of magnitude for simple systems. We'll have to shortly

look into how neural emulation codes scale on commodity clusters, but I
<br>
doubt news will be very good.

<p>We're not just talking about most of the CNS (neuropatients miss a lot of
<br>
that, but have way better cerebral preservation). You have to imbed that
<br>
into a body phantom, and put that into the artificial reality renderer
<br>
box.

<p>Nope, you render the impact of photons on the retina. I'm referring to the
<br>
freeze/slice/scan procedure, as it's the only one which is relevant to our

time frame.

<p>Inhumanity is a wide field. You're describing something distinctly

autistic.
