<p><p><em>&gt; One large risk, which I am certainly not the first to observe, is as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follows.  Suppose someone creates a huge media uproar over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity -- with good intentions, but resulting in a widespread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superficial, glitzy &quot;Hollywood&quot; style vision of the Singularity.  People
</em><br>
get
<br>
<em>&gt; excited.  Then the Singularity frustratingly fails to come tomorrow --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead there's another dot-com crash or 9/11 disaster, or whatever.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity becomes the next Virtual Reality -- i.e. the next craze to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people overoptimistically psyched about the possibility of X, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disenchanted with the slowness of the actual advent of X.
</em><br>
<p>I had been worried about this as well, but its been my increasing impressin
<br>
lately that what are probably the most &quot;lively&quot; AI projects in the world
<br>
(Novamente, SIAI) have a very real need and use for funding *now* -- in the
<br>
short term.  I am also in the school of thought that says that the right AI
<br>
design could probably run on the hardware avaialable now.  Therefore, what I
<br>
would like to see is a greater spread of Singularity ideas soon to increase
<br>
near term funding, and thereby improve the odds of a Singularity in the
<br>
short term.  I'm not worried about Singularity in the long term; I'm
<br>
convinced that it will happen no matter what I do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Singularity: The Movie&quot; sounds great.  Sure, if it comes out like &quot;2001:
</em><br>
A
<br>
<em>&gt; Space Odyssey&quot;.  But what if it comes out like &quot;A.I.: Artificial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Intelligence&quot;, or, say, &quot;Robocop.&quot;  Feeding deep ideas to the popular
</em><br>
media
<br>
<em>&gt; mill has a way of transforming them into trivial and foolish things,
</em><br>
easily
<br>
<em>&gt; dismissed as fantasies.
</em><br>
<p>Permuation City: The Movie, might be a good start.  As would any movie that
<br>
portrays uploading as something other than evil or a tool of evil.
<br>
Permutation City does spread the concept you mentioned of Singularity as the
<br>
playground of the rich, however...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 2) DEMONIZATION
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And remember, nearly all people in the world are religious.  I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything against religion as a general principle -- I have great respect
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; many of the varieties of spiritual experience, and in fact my wife is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buddhist priest.  But the fact is that most current religions teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superstitous doctrines that are implicitly or explicitly anti-Singularity
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; nature.  Religious people by and large are made very uneasy by cloning,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploading, and other ideas that we on this list take for granted.
</em><br>
<p>I know what you mean.  My own upbringing would very easily equate the
<br>
realization of a Sysop with the realization of &quot;Satan's Plan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems very, very possible that wide attention brought to the
</em><br>
consequences
<br>
<em>&gt; of future technology, might lead to a widespread outcry to SQUELCH this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, just as we're seeing now with stem cell research and human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning in the US.
</em><br>
<p>Fortunately, the very nature of Singularity as an intangible,
<br>
counter-intuitive fantasy should allow those who do not understand it to
<br>
easily dismiss it.  AI programs are not nearly as photogenic as Dolly the
<br>
Sheep, or nearly as tangible as tortillas made biotech corn.  It will be
<br>
hard to demonize seed AI research until it has some sort of &quot;abominable&quot;
<br>
poster child -- something that is unlikely in the short term without some
<br>
more funding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From this point of view, the &quot;trivialization&quot; risk may be a *good* thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may be that the only thing saving us from  demonization by the masses,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and consequent government repression of our research, is precisely the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; INABILITY of the masses of humanity to do anything but reject or
</em><br>
trivialize
<br>
<em>&gt; ideas as far-out as the Singularity.  (Please note my wording: I said it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;may&quot; be.  I don't know.)
</em><br>
<p>Well said.  I would like to point out that I was being a bit facetious with
<br>
some of my media suggestions :)  But I think it may actually be hard to
<br>
simultaneously trivialize and demonize the Singularity.  When you really
<br>
think about it, the movie The Matrix was probably the worst-case scenario
<br>
for a movie about AI and artificial environments.  But people loved it, and
<br>
many of those who didn't just dismiss the whole thing as hollywood fantasy
<br>
actually left the theater thinking about the blurring line between reality
<br>
and simulation.  It is easy enough to strike down the extremely illogical
<br>
premise of the movie (which was the result of trivialization) for those who
<br>
happen to fear AI and uploading because of it.
