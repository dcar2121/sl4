I don't often forward posts from the Extropians list, but this one is so
<br>
good that I just had to do it.

<p><em>&gt; Uploading by definition means that you are confined to a system which is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than the physical universe and subject to the effects of the physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, i.e., you do not have the freedom to move around in space-time or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access the physical resources of the universe.  Even if you assume that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system you are in has widely-spread nodes across star systems or whatever, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and can access physical resources via telepresence or robotic agents, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are still metaphysically limited.  This is not the situation a Transhuman 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wants to be in.
</em><br>
<p>You may be thinking of a specific scenario for uploading that is more
<br>
restrictive than necessary.  Broadly speaking we use uploading to refer
<br>
to transferring our minds from their current biological brains to some
<br>
kind of artificial system like a computer.
<br>
<p>Our minds are already confined to a system which is less than the
<br>
universe, namely our brains.  Transferring them to a computer does
<br>
not have to limit our options to move around or access the universe.
<br>
Of course if the computer is gigantic and needs massive power feeds
<br>
then moving it will be difficult, but in principle one could have
<br>
a small computer and move it around easily.
<br>
<p>Even without that, I don't see what the problem is with telepresence.  In
<br>
a way, all of our perceptions are mediated already by sensory modalities.
<br>
Our brains live in a dark, quiet, wet place.  That is the reality.
<br>
It is only by means of our senses that we get the illusion of being out
<br>
there in the world.  In a way, our bodies are a form of telepresence,
<br>
operated by our brains, huddling safe in their little caves of bone.
<br>
<p>Uploading also does not necessarily mean operating in virtual reality
<br>
independent of the physical universe.  Of course if the new system is
<br>
super-fast, it may not be desirable to spend too much time waiting
<br>
for things to happen in the physical universe, so naturally we would
<br>
turn to some form of VR which can operate at a more convenient speed.
<br>
But manipulating the physical universe will still be a necessary and
<br>
important activity.  Even if you spend most of your time in a VR there
<br>
needs to be construction, maintenance and defense of the physical
<br>
substrate which runs the VR.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect that a lot of people like the notion because it is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;scientific&quot; equivalent of &quot;Heaven&quot;...
</em><br>
<p>Now I think you are getting even more specific and picturing a very
<br>
special kind of VR, where you have fantasy wish-fulfillment.  I
<br>
suspect that this will be a popular form of recreation but will not
<br>
be the only mode in which people interact in the future.
