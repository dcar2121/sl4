<p>
<em>&gt; To get greater exposure (with the ultimate aim of adequate funding for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right projects) we need more than books.  We need Singularity:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Magazine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity: The Multimedia Experience, Singularity: The TV Documentary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity: The Motion Picture, Singularity for the Mac and the PC, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, even Singularity: The Jiggling Plush Novelty. (I'm thinking fluffy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bunnies here)
</em><br>
<p>I agree that wider exposure to the Singularity idea (and related but yet
<br>
shocking notions) could possibly be a good thing.
<br>
<p>However, there are several major cautions to be observed here.  I will list
<br>
two, in order of increasing severity.
<br>
<p>1) TRIVIALIZATION
<br>
<p>One large risk, which I am certainly not the first to observe, is as
<br>
follows.  Suppose someone creates a huge media uproar over the
<br>
Singularity -- with good intentions, but resulting in a widespread
<br>
superficial, glitzy &quot;Hollywood&quot; style vision of the Singularity.  People get
<br>
excited.  Then the Singularity frustratingly fails to come tomorrow --
<br>
instead there's another dot-com crash or 9/11 disaster, or whatever.  The
<br>
Singularity becomes the next Virtual Reality -- i.e. the next craze to get
<br>
people overoptimistically psyched about the possibility of X, and then
<br>
disenchanted with the slowness of the actual advent of X.
<br>
<p>&quot;Singularity: The Movie&quot; sounds great.  Sure, if it comes out like &quot;2001: A
<br>
Space Odyssey&quot;.  But what if it comes out like &quot;A.I.: Artificial
<br>
Intelligence&quot;, or, say, &quot;Robocop.&quot;  Feeding deep ideas to the popular media
<br>
mill has a way of transforming them into trivial and foolish things, easily
<br>
dismissed as fantasies.
<br>
<p>I'm not saying this is an unavoidable problem, but it's certainly a big
<br>
risk.  Modern culture can absorb *anything* as superficial entertainment,
<br>
even the end of the world as we know it... (wait a minute - hey - that's a
<br>
pop song already! ;)
<br>
<p>Really getting the average person to *think* about something, to accept the
<br>
reality of something counterintuitive, is a much harder problem than
<br>
disseminating ideas in popular media forms.
<br>
<p>I don't have the solution to this problem right now, but I can tell you that
<br>
the solution to *effectively* popularizing the Singularity lies in a really
<br>
subtle consideration of mass psychology.  And the solution will be very
<br>
different in different countries of the world.
<br>
<p>2) DEMONIZATION
<br>
<p>Thinking about the great variety of nations in the world brings up another
<br>
risk: that popularization leads to rampant spreading of some variant of
<br>
Luddite meme.
<br>
<p>The Singularity sounds pretty fucking different in Brazil than in the US, to
<br>
name two of the countries with which I'm fairly familiar.  For one thing,
<br>
the average person in a poor country will immediately assume that the
<br>
Singularity is going to be only for the rich -- since, well, nearly all
<br>
other technology is, right?
<br>
<p>The statements of Moravec and other Extropians to effect that &quot;the poor of
<br>
the world are like dinosaurs headed for extinction, and who cares&quot; -- should
<br>
they ever get widespread international media attention -- aren't going to
<br>
play very well in the favelas on the hills outside Rio...
<br>
<p>And remember, nearly all people in the world are religious.  I don't have
<br>
anything against religion as a general principle -- I have great respect for
<br>
many of the varieties of spiritual experience, and in fact my wife is a
<br>
Buddhist priest.  But the fact is that most current religions teach
<br>
superstitous doctrines that are implicitly or explicitly anti-Singularity in
<br>
nature.  Religious people by and large are made very uneasy by cloning,
<br>
uploading, and other ideas that we on this list take for granted.
<br>
<p>It seems very, very possible that wide attention brought to the consequences
<br>
of future technology, might lead to a widespread outcry to SQUELCH this
<br>
technology, just as we're seeing now with stem cell research and human
<br>
cloning in the US.
<br>
<p>Sure, I believe that squelching AI would be vastly harder than squelching
<br>
biotech, since computers are everyday household appliances by now.  But do
<br>
we really want government agents trying to crush AI research, so that this
<br>
e-mail list has to be conducted with homebrew crypto, and academic
<br>
researchers working on Real AI have to adopt mainstream &quot;cover-up&quot; research
<br>
programs or lose their jobs (heck, this is already almost true just based on
<br>
cultural bias within the computer science community!!)?
<br>
<p>We need to seriously consider the possibility that mass understanding of the
<br>
Singularity at this point would be a BAD thing.
<br>
<p>I am not saying for sure that it would be a bad thing.  But to so blithely
<br>
assume it would be a good thing, seems to me very naive about human nature
<br>
and the diversity of world cultures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this point of view, the &quot;trivialization&quot; risk may be a *good* thing.
</em><br>
It may be that the only thing saving us from  demonization by the masses,
<br>
and consequent government repression of our research, is precisely the
<br>
INABILITY of the masses of humanity to do anything but reject or trivialize
<br>
ideas as far-out as the Singularity.  (Please note my wording: I said it
<br>
&quot;may&quot; be.  I don't know.)
<br>
<p>I'm sorry if this sounds elitist.  However, the fact is that a large
<br>
percentage of the world's population holds what I (and probably almost all
<br>
of us on this list) consider to be ridiculously dangerous and irrational
<br>
views.  Examples are well-known:
<br>
<p>-- the post-death journey to Heaven or Hell
<br>
<p>-- reincarnation
<br>
<p>-- the belief that their own racial or cultural group is somehow objectively
<br>
superior to all others (&quot;the chosen people of god&quot;, to use a phrase
<br>
associated with one of the cultural groups into which I was born)
<br>
<p>-- the use of the belief in their own group's superiority to justify
<br>
murdering members of other groups, individually or via intertribal or
<br>
international warfare
<br>
<p>These beliefs gratify human emotions in deep ways and have proved
<br>
impressively resistant to reason.  Reasoning about the Singularity is not
<br>
likely to sway them.  And that is all we have to offer about the Singularity
<br>
right now: Reasoning, plus a bit of associated poetry.  [Furthermore, this
<br>
is a line of reasoning that even the vast majority of academics and
<br>
scientists and intellectuals do not (yet) accept....]
<br>
<p>Well, I have typed on this long enough for the morning -- time to get the
<br>
kids brekky -- but although I have not brought this message to any grand
<br>
conclusion I hope I have at least made the point that popularizing the
<br>
Singularity in an effective way is neither
<br>
<p>a) easy, nor
<br>
<p>b) necessarily desirable
<br>
<p><p>There are big, big issues here.
