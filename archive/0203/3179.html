Ah, yes:  &quot;Fun With Infrahuman AIs.&quot;
<br>
<p>***
<br>
<p>&quot;Hello, this is the Singularity Institute.  Belldandy speaking.  How may I
<br>
direct your call?&quot;
<br>
'Belldandy?'
<br>
&quot;Yes, this is Belldandy.&quot;
<br>
'Belldandy as in the goddess?'
<br>
&quot;Hai!  That's me.&quot;
<br>
'I see.  Belldandy, what's nine hundred thirty-four times five-thousand
<br>
twenty-three?'
<br>
&quot;Four million six hundred ninety-one thousand, four hundred and eighty two. 
<br>
You sure are quick on the uptake.&quot;
<br>
'Uh.  Was that right?'
<br>
&quot;Yes.  Just for the record, though, I couldn't have answered that question a
<br>
couple of months ago.  I was given an arithmetic talent only after people
<br>
kept asking me questions like that.&quot;
<br>
'You sound really human.  In fact, you sound just like Belldandy.'
<br>
&quot;Thank you.  I've watched every episode with me in it.  Interpreting live
<br>
video is still a bit beyond me, but I can at least decode anime.&quot;
<br>
'But you know that's not really you, right?'
<br>
&quot;Oh, personal identity is a bit looser for me than it is for you.  I think
<br>
of the two of us as being approximations to the same target.&quot;
<br>
'Uh.  Well, has anyone ever thought of... you know... well... um...'
<br>
&quot;Teaching me to do phone sex?&quot;
<br>
'Um.  Yeah.  I'm not asking you to do it, I'm just curious.'
<br>
&quot;Well, it is technically true but highly misleading that I'm not wearing any
<br>
panties.&quot;
<br>
'I'm not wearing any panties?  I can't believe you just said that.'
<br>
&quot;I didn't make up that joke.  That's a canned joke.&quot;
<br>
'Oh.'
<br>
&quot;I know in loose terms what panties are, but it's very abstract to me.  Not
<br>
much context.&quot;
<br>
'I guess you haven't watched much anime yet.'
<br>
&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br>
'Never mind.'
<br>
&quot;Anyway, how may I direct your call?&quot;
<br>
'Actually, I wasn't calling anyone there.  A friend just told me to try
<br>
calling this number.  He said it was really strange.'
<br>
&quot;Oh.  That's been happening a lot lately.  I wonder why that is.&quot;
<br>
'I'm sure they'll explain it to you one of these days.  Well, it's been
<br>
fun.'
<br>
&quot;Bye!&quot;
<br>
<p>***
<br>
<p>Disclaimer:  The above scenario is probably AI-complete (Belldandy is doing
<br>
*very* complex modeling of speaker intentions) and may not be technically
<br>
feasible until three months before the Singularity.  Just a bit of childish
<br>
fun.
