<p>Well gee, time to start working on the software...:-)
<br>
<p>That might take a LOT more than four years, as at this time I'd have to
<br>
say &quot;computer intelligence&quot; is still pretty much even more of an
<br>
oxymoron than &quot;military intelligence&quot;, and it is by no means clear that
<br>
the key to solving it is &quot;more&quot; of anything -- I'd say instead that the
<br>
problem of intelligence (or self-awareness) is still algorithmic, not
<br>
processing power per se.  We don't know how it works yet; at best we
<br>
crudely simulate it -- it may be that we could make our existing
<br>
computers &quot;intelligent&quot; if we only knew how.  What they lack in
<br>
connections they can make up in speed, since human brains function
<br>
(admittedly in parallel) in chemical time, which is slooooow.
<br>
<p>As far as work load and value are concerned, ANY computer today can do
<br>
far more work/second than a human can in its domain of application,
<br>
which is why we buy them.  Anybody who wants to show up in my office
<br>
with some dice and a slide rule to take over my physics computations is
<br>
welcome, but be warned that I'll need your services for most of the rest
<br>
of the probable lifetime of Mr. Sun to make any real progress.
<br>
<p>However, computers are better viewed as amplifiers of human abilities
<br>
than as replacements for humans.  One human plus a computer may replace
<br>
many humans at certain tasks (like generating 10^18 or so steps in a
<br>
Markov Process and sampling them appropriately), but I cannot forsee a
<br>
time when the human is entirely removed from this equation until
<br>
(possibly when) computers are truly self aware and can dream up useful
<br>
or even useless work to do on their own.
<br>
<p>On another note, I'd disagree somewhat with the extrapolation details of
<br>
this particular Moore's Law CBA -- for example, it seems unfair to base
<br>
performance on a theoretical measure of instruction latency under ideal
<br>
circumstances and then create a system with a LOT of relatively slow
<br>
memory that in actual application would cut your ideal floating point
<br>
performance by a factor of four or more.  Then, it isn't clear that
<br>
floating point rates are as relevant to AI as (for example) integer
<br>
rates, although lacking anything like real AI this is open to argument.
<br>
Finally, it isn't clear why these particular hard disk and memory ratios
<br>
where chosen as part of the metric, especially given the fact that hard
<br>
disk has (recently, at least) expanded in capacity with a different
<br>
exponent than CPU and memory, and that &quot;memory&quot; is available in a wide
<br>
variety of speeds, widths, and (hence) cost-benefit optimum points.
<br>
<p>For example, one notes that memory and hard disk are the most expensive
<br>
components in the &quot;standard system&quot; cited, that the use of 3x MORE
<br>
expensive DDR might get you closer to the theoretical FLOPS peak (but
<br>
still quite far away from my own direct experience), and that for
<br>
aggregate performance to have any meaning whatsoever in the attempt to
<br>
build an &quot;intelligent cluster&quot; (which seems to be where this is going)
<br>
one would be better off mostly neglecting hard disk capacity altogether
<br>
in favor of networking.  Presuming (not unreasonably, based on the
<br>
nonlocality of neural models of intelligence) that &quot;intelligence&quot; is
<br>
likely to be a tightly coupled, synchronous parallel problem, the
<br>
network would be far important than CPU speed, memory size or speed, and
<br>
disk size or speed in determining what fraction of the theoretical node
<br>
in-cache peaks can actually be applied to the problem as a measure of
<br>
aggregate performance.  However, networking speed is hard to include in
<br>
the metric -- it is pretty strongly bounded, has a LESS favorable
<br>
exponent in Moore's law, and there is both latency and bandwidth to
<br>
consider even then.
<br>
<p>To conclude, this seems to be a moderately naive metric for systems
<br>
comparison and I wouldn't recommend that it be widely adopted:-)
<br>
<p>None of which is intended as a flame, BTW.  The idea was undoubtedly
<br>
presented more for fun than as a serious statement that in four years I
<br>
need to watch out or I might be replaced by a computer cluster, and fun
<br>
it is...;-)
