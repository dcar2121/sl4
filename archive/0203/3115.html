<p>
Two other things that came up on the chat session:
<br>
<p>1) Some people thought my paper on intelligence &amp; levels of
<br>
self-modifiability was hard to understand due to the use of math notation.
<br>
<p>I believe I can write a version that does not involve any math notation.  In
<br>
a sense there is no loss in doing this sense I did not use the math notation
<br>
to do any proofs or calculations.  The reason I like using mathematical
<br>
concepts for such things is that it is the only way to unambiguously define
<br>
things.  With verbal descriptions of things like &quot;intelligence&quot; one too
<br>
often seems to get bogged down in disputes over the meanings of words ...
<br>
and gets lost in the web of interlocking meanings.
<br>
<p>2) Eli and I continued our debate on hierarchical vs. heterarchical goal
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>Recently Eli asked me to write something systematic on my ideas about goal
<br>
systems and Friendliness.  I replied that it was hard for me to do so,
<br>
outside of the context of the overall Novamente design.  However, I've been
<br>
thinking about this a bit, and though it's hard, I don't think it's
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p>So, I'll write these two documents at some point in the next month or so....
<br>
(I always think I don't have time for such things because of having so much
<br>
&quot;serious work&quot; on my hands, but yet the fun conceptual documents always seem
<br>
to weasel their way into my schedule anyway ;)
<br>
<p>I'm afraid that, in spite of me being one of the biggest goofballs on the
<br>
face of God's green Earth, my presence seems to have made this SL4 chat a
<br>
little serious than the previous one....  Next time I'll try to bring up
<br>
iridescent chinchillas or some such ;&gt;   Actually, the ongoing meme at
<br>
Webmind Inc. was about goats -- but, well... this is a G-rated list ;.&gt;
