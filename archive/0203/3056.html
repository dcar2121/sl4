Hi Eliezer
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see.  I guess I'd better administer the oath, then, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remainder of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the SL4 list standing in for the human species as witnesses.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, Eli.... As you know, you're bringing up the good old
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli = &quot;100% Singularity dedication&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;versus
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben = &quot;Powerful Singularity dedication plus some ordinary human
<br>
attachments&quot;
<br>
<p>debate again.
<br>
<p>This is familiar ground for SL4, and I'd guess that many of the members of
<br>
this list are probably bored with this particular quibble between the two of
<br>
us.
<br>
<p>But I'll answer you anyway ;)
<br>
<p>I don't particularly believe in &quot;oaths&quot;, although about 20 years ago, I had
<br>
some Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters that did....
<br>
<p>If I did believe in oaths, however, I wouldn't take your oath.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you, Ben Goertzel, having declared your intention to entangle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Singularity and thereby make the death or survival of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and perhaps wholly dependent on your actions, acknowledge that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility you have accepted transcends all other considerations, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; swear that you shall hold it inviolable?  Do you swear that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insofar as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have any especial ability to influence the course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity, you shall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never use this ability for any personal consideration, and you shall act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only under the name of all humanity or all sentient life, and not for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lesser group or faction?
</em><br>
<p>As we've discussed before, Eli, my answer is: Almost but not quite.
<br>
<p>I find this question, when taken seriously, poses &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; type
<br>
dilemmas.
<br>
<p>(If anyone doesn't know this William Styron novel, later cinematized: it
<br>
regards a young Polish mother who, while standing in line waiting for entry
<br>
to a Nazi death camp with her two children by her side, is given the choice
<br>
to choose at most *one* of her kids to be spared from death.  The child
<br>
selected for death, and the child spared, will see exactly what her choice
<br>
was.  The child selected for death will watch their sibling walk off to
<br>
safety, and watch their mom with fearful eyes as they're dragged away,
<br>
knowing their mom has just chosen them for death.  What should she do?
<br>
Choosing one is an impossible choice -- she loves them both infinitely and
<br>
equally -- but choosing none means they both die.  She chooses her son, and
<br>
torments herself psychologically for the rest of her life.  Her son is
<br>
killed a few years later, anyway.)
<br>
<p>Your oath immediately leads me to the question: Would I murder my own
<br>
children for the Singularity?
<br>
<p>And my answer is: I really don't know.
<br>
<p>Now, Eli, perhaps you believe yourself to be *so* altruistic and so
<br>
dedicated to the Singularity that,
<br>
<p>a) you'd never have children except under very unusual circumstances,
<br>
because it would interfere with your work toward the Singularity
<br>
<p>b) if you did have kids, and it were somehow necessary, you would
<br>
*definitely* murder them for the Singularity
<br>
<p>However, even if you *do* beieve yourself to be this purely altruistic and
<br>
Singularity-dedicated, *I* do not have faith that *your* altruism and
<br>
Singularity-dedication are that absolute.  I don't consider it *impossible*
<br>
than they are, but I also have a lot of respect for the diverse complexity
<br>
and perversity of human nature, and the ability of novel situations to bring
<br>
out novel responses in human beings.
<br>
<p>I very much appreciate the deep philosophical/ethical approach to
<br>
Singularity work that you advocate and embody.  However, I do not feel that
<br>
the kind of 100% altruistic Singularity-dedication that you describe is
<br>
necessary in order to work effectively and beneficially toward Real AI and
<br>
the Singularity.
<br>
<p>I have a deep-seated skepticism of &quot;the ends justifies the means&quot; type
<br>
thinking, and, in my view, the extreme nature of your proposed oath has a
<br>
bit of this flavor to it.
<br>
<p>This isn't to say that there couldn't be a circumstance in which I wouldn't
<br>
make the choice to murder my kids in order to bring about the Singularity.
<br>
However, it would have to be a pretty extreme circumstance.  Under very many
<br>
circumstances, I would decide that a Singularity that required me to murder
<br>
my children wasn't the right kind to bring about anyway....
<br>
<p>Anyway, rather than worrying about bizarre ethical worst-cases, I am
<br>
proceeding under the assumption that bringing the Singularity about is most
<br>
likely NOT going to involve any terrifying Sophie's-choice-type dilemmas for
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>In fact, Eli, I reckon that in 100 year or so, our uploaded selves are going
<br>
to look back on conversations like this and emit some powerful fully-digital
<br>
laughter -- at oaths, children, seriousness, and all the other ridiculous
<br>
though somewhat charming human concepts and mental habit-patterns with which
<br>
they are bound up.
<br>
<p>Hmmm... a conversation about circumstances in which I might butcher my
<br>
offspring to save the human and posthuman race is really a cheerful way to
<br>
begin the day ;) .  (Of course, I have only my own subconscious to blame for
<br>
turning the conversation in this particular direction, I suppose... it just
<br>
seemed the best way to illustrate why I can't 100% accept your oath.)   Time
<br>
to do something more entertaining, maybe some unanesthetized
<br>
self-administered dental work or something...
<br>
<p><p>-- Ben G
