<br>
<p><em>&gt; I was reading the book &quot;Conversations with a Mathematician&quot; by algorithmic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information pioneer Gregory Chaitin today, and I found the following
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passage:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;[M]y personal opinion is that AI is not a mathematical problem, it's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering problem..  To me a human being is just a very complicated
</em><br>
piece
<br>
<em>&gt; of engineering that's exquisitely well-suited for surviving in this
</em><br>
world..
<br>
<p>I have always thought this. But surely anyone who agrees with the &quot;mind is a
<br>
machine&quot; theory, like I assume all of us on this list are, could infer that
<br>
&quot;reverse engineering&quot; the mind inside a modern computer substrate is indeed
<br>
an engineering problem.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;[I]t's very often the case that theoreticians can show that in theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no way to solve a problem, but software engineers can find a
</em><br>
clever
<br>
<em>&gt; algorithm that usually works, or that usually gives you a good
</em><br>
approximation
<br>
<em>&gt; in a reasonable amount of time.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe I'm thinking on a different plane here, but to me the clever
<br>
algorithms are indeed a mathematical problem. For example, computer graphics
<br>
algorithms are used to render a potentially real 3D model onto a 2D screen.
<br>
All of these algorithms use shortcuts to reduce computation time, i.e.
<br>
instead of modelling every single photon's behaviour in a scene, ther are
<br>
shading algorithms that approximate what it looks like. As the raw computing
<br>
power gets faster, the computer graphics industry can use more complex
<br>
algorithms for better mathematical approximations. But the raw computing
<br>
power may come in the form of faster CPU's, parallel processing in clusters,
<br>
etc. That is both a software and hardware engineering problem.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &quot;We humans aren't artistic masterpieces of design, we're patched together,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit by bit, and retouched every time that there's an emergency and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design has to be changed!
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like the eXtreme Programming methodology! :-) Or more likely the
<br>
timeless classic Waterfall method of software development.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  We're strange, awkward creatures, but it all sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of works!  And I think that an AI is also going to be like that..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;[A] working AI is going to be like some kind of Frankenstein monster
</em><br>
that'
<br>
<em>&gt; s patched together bit by bit until one day we realize that the monster
</em><br>
sort
<br>
<em>&gt; of works, that it's finally intelligent enough! &quot;
</em><br>
<p>That's one way it could work. Another way is with a very formalized
<br>
methodology that begins with design and modelling first. It's a Project
<br>
Management / Engineering problem. Thank goodness we have organizations such
<br>
as the Singularity Institute to monitor and encourage proven and proper
<br>
project management methodologies so as to reach The Goal with efficiency,
<br>
minimum faults, and all those other nice things that we all want from
<br>
software but only the military and NASA seem to adhere to the strictest
<br>
standards, even if they did have to define those standards for their own
<br>
use.
<br>
<p><p>So I still believe that a general AI could come from a cluster of 286's. All
<br>
you need is enough of them working in parallel, not necessarily running
<br>
exactly the same software, or individual OS. Of course, the more powerful
<br>
computers help speed things up a bit, but it doesn't make the 286's useless.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
