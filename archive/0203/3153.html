<p><em>&gt; The book exists. As of last month, it's been out there in trade paperback
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Forge/Tor. It's called THE SPIKE. Buy it and give it to your favorite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auntie. Well, maybe not. Your favorite teacher or geek pal. (I'm not
</em><br>
saying
<br>
<em>&gt; this for the royalties, pleasant as those are. I spent a lot of effort on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that book, and I believe it's a good, lively general introduction to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range of relevant issues.)
</em><br>
<p>And as soon as my local library gets a copy I'll be able to afford to read
<br>
it.  I can't wait to do away with poverty!
<br>
<p>Books are great, and I'm glad to see that the Singularity message has now
<br>
been given quality air-time in this medium.  But as you yourself admit, it's
<br>
not going to help my auntie.  Even many people who read books will not
<br>
neccessarily pick up an entire paperback about topics so &quot;obviously&quot; (to
<br>
SL0-2) fanciful -- no... Grandiose!
<br>
<p>&quot;You mean you want me to read a *whole* book??&quot;
<br>
<p>To get greater exposure (with the ultimate aim of adequate funding for the
<br>
right projects) we need more than books.  We need Singularity: The Magazine,
<br>
Singularity: The Multimedia Experience, Singularity: The TV Documentary,
<br>
Singularity: The Motion Picture, Singularity for the Mac and the PC, and
<br>
yes, even Singularity: The Jiggling Plush Novelty. (I'm thinking fluffy
<br>
bunnies here)
<br>
<p>I personally am planning to script a multimedia experience, but to organize
<br>
my thoughts I recently decided that I needed to give a Singularity FAQ a
<br>
shot first.  If there's one adjective I'm going for with this document it is
<br>
&quot;inviting.&quot;  The design is multi-layered (one &quot;durantula&quot; suggested this on
<br>
Wednesday), with the main FAQ page being just four concisely answered
<br>
questions.  &quot;The Spike&quot; is even mentioned in the third paragraph!  Follow-up
<br>
questions on this page are links to a couple layers of progressively more
<br>
detailed and technical responses to equally technical concerns.  The
<br>
structure branches out into what will eventually be short summaries and
<br>
introductions to some of the best -- and often most difficult -- source
<br>
materials out there.  I may need to request help on this last part, since
<br>
unlike some on this list I can't yet claim to have read the complete body of
<br>
Singularity-related works.  Stay tuned, everyone, and feel free to offer me
<br>
some suggestions on which source materials are the best (offlist is probably
<br>
best for everyone else's sake).  Feel free to offer me employment, too --
<br>
I've been dying to read &quot;Transcension.&quot;
