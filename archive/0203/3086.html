<em>&gt; Surely you've already had some experience with this in Webmind/Novamente?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I.e., you argued over whether it was engineering or math or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neuroscience or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive psychology, and then you implemented it and found out it was all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same thing?  I'm not necessarily saying that I would expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; routine experience, but weren't there at least one or two memorable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasions?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, all of us who were involved with the conceptual design of the
<br>
system had been thinking about these issues for *years* before we started
<br>
the project.  So those of us on the core &quot;conceptual&quot; team (Pei Wang, Cassio
<br>
Pennachin, me, Stephan Bugaj, Cate Hartley, Anton Kolonin, Jeff pressing, a
<br>
few others) had all pretty  much already pre-internalized the idea that
<br>
designing an AI would be an integrative process.
<br>
<p>To some extent the core conceptual team was selected to be composed of
<br>
people whose philosophical outlook was *vaguely similar* to mine, though
<br>
there were significant differences as well.  (For instance, Jeff was
<br>
strongly biased toward cognitive psychology and neuroscience; Pei tends to
<br>
think his NARS inference equations are the essence of it all; Anton likes
<br>
relationships between relationships between relationships and reinforcement
<br>
learning; Stephan tends to believe sophisticated perception is a
<br>
prerequisite to cognition; Cassio is an self-organizing
<br>
software-agents-systems guy, etc.)
<br>
<p>But there were plenty of assorted folks around the company who weren't part
<br>
of the core conceptual AI team but who had different, deeply-thought-out
<br>
ideas about AI.  At least one guy strongly believed for a while there was
<br>
*one simple abstract equation* at the heart of intelligence, which he was
<br>
constantly on the verge of discovering ... (he  may still believe this, I'm
<br>
not sure...)
<br>
<p>It was good to have gadflies around holding radically different points of
<br>
view; and it was also good that the members core group held basically
<br>
similar though nonidentical philosophies...
