<p>Well, actually, I *am* diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, and had a 
<br>
special-education monitor into the tenth grade.
<br>
<p>Also, I got a perfect score on the math section of the SAT, for what it's 
<br>
worth, so *maybe* I can relate to thinking directly in math at least 
<br>
slightly more than some people can.  That's not to say that I don't think 
<br>
that being uploaded and directly linked with the equivalent of a math 
<br>
coprocesser wouldn't help me do things that are now completely impossible, 
<br>
or that I can *imagine* knowing intuitively how to play a perfect game of 
<br>
chess, and being able to spend a second or two figuring out who would win 
<br>
such a game!
