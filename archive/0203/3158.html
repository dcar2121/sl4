<p>Yep. Not much to shock those in this corner. But of course it's intended as
<br>
the 21st century equivalent of Arthur Clarke's PROFILES OF THE FUTURE, as
<br>
he notes, recommending it, in his latest edition. And I gather that was
<br>
what was being discussed in the Wednesday chat--the need for something
<br>
fairly comprehensive, well written, accessible, and *available already*.

<p>Thanks, Ben. That's a large part of the intended audience.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One peripheral comment: To me, the term &quot;The Spike&quot; just doesn't have the

</em><br>
<p>Very possibly, especially with Ray Kurzweil's forthcoming book using the
<br>
term `Singularity' in the title. I don't care; inventing new terms is easy,
<br>
conveying the singularity perspective is what counts. I devised `the Spike'
<br>
as slightly less of a mouthful, easier to spell, and because I figured
<br>
people might lock on to the image of that spikish exponential curve. Is it
<br>
a competitive meme-handle? Well, it's already been used as an episode title
<br>
and recurring motif in one TV series on accelerating technologies and their
<br>
implications (in Australia last year, and presumably will appear sooner or
<br>
later on whatever Yank TV channel does animals and medicine and science). A
<br>
sociologist of science here has written national newspaper articles on `the
<br>
Two Spikes' (the singularity versus over-population and other doom
<br>
scenarios). Has the term `Singularity' managed that yet? (Obviously it has
<br>
in James Hughes' `Changesurfer' radio show; how about other media?)
