&quot;The authors conclude that our experiment measures the dark side of human
<br>
nature...&quot;  Obviously the authors aren't being quite pessimistic enough, or
<br>
they would have said:  &quot;Our experiment adds another of humanity's many dark
<br>
sides to the collection that have been experimentally measured.&quot;  No cause
<br>
for despair, though; there are experimentally measured good sides, too.

Subject: Research Shows Just How Much People Hate A Winner
<br>
<p>I recently received this chilling article on the cryonics mailing
<br>
list I frequent.  It goes a long way towards explaining why
<br>
Libertarianism hasn't caught on, why the US is plagued by
<br>
terrorism, and even why some individuals sometimes behave in
<br>
petty or cruel manners, even to their own detriment.  &quot;What a
<br>
piece of work is man&quot; (Shakespeare)!

Research Shows Just How Much People Hate A Winner
<br>
<p>New research by economists at the Universities of Warwick and Oxford in the
<br>
UK has provided surprising insight into just how much people hate a winner.
<br>
<p>It also shows what lengths human beings are prepared to go to damage a
<br>
winner out of a sense of envy or fairness.
<br>
<p>The researchers, Professor Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick and
<br>
Dr. Daniel Zizzo of Oxford, designed a new kind of experiment, played with
<br>
real cash, in which subjects could anonymously  burn  away other people s
<br>
money -- but only at the cost of giving up some of their own.
<br>
<p>Despite this cost to themselves, and contrary to economists  usual
<br>
assumptions, 62% of those tested chose to destroy part of other test
<br>
subjects  cash. In the experiment, half of all the laboratory earnings were
<br>
deliberately destroyed by fellow subjects.
<br>
<p>Everyone in the laboratory sessions was anonymous and hidden. The subjects
<br>
had only a computer terminal, into which they played, and in which they
<br>
could see how much other people were winning.
<br>
<p>In each session, the test subjects began with a betting stage which gave
<br>
them some money (about 10 pounds, but sometimes much more), creating an
<br>
unequal wealth distribution.
<br>
<p>In the final stage, the  burning  stage, subjects could if they wished
<br>
eliminate ( burn away ) other people s money -  but only by giving up some
<br>
of their own cash winnings. At the most expensive level, they had to give
<br>
up 25 pence to destroy 1 full pound owned by someone else.
<br>
<p>It was made clear to all subjects that burning others would reduce the cash
<br>
of the person choosing to burn.
<br>
<p>The economists expected little burning, and especially that the laboratory
<br>
subjects would stop destroying other people s money once the price reached
<br>
0.25, but in fact they found that even this high price did little to stop
<br>
people from annihilating other people s wealth. Most individuals still
<br>
chose to hurt others, despite the large cost to their own pocket.
<br>
<p>The researchers found that those who gained the most additional money at
<br>
the betting stage burned poor and rich alike, while disadvantaged
<br>
laboratory subjects mainly targeted those subjects they saw getting what
<br>
they perceived as undeserved financial windfalls.
<br>
<p>The authors conclude that  our experiment measures the dark side of human
<br>
nature.
