<p>More practically, microprocessor manufacturers and other tech component
<br>
manufacturers don't generally focus on reducing consumer costs, they
<br>
focus on increasing speed (and other overall performance measures) at
<br>
constant consumer cost and relatively high margins.  They can do this
<br>
because tech profit margins depend to a significant extent on demand in
<br>
a fairly inelastic market with very limited competition.
<br>
<p>[Parenthetically:  A good example of this is hard disk.  I'm fairly
<br>
certain that 10 GB hard disks could be sold for $25 retail, much as
<br>
floppy drives are today, if vendors were forced by competition to focus
<br>
on decreasing price instead of maintaining margin by increasing disk
<br>
size.  If, however, there were $25 10 GB hard disks, perhaps 2/3 of
<br>
system buyers would probably choose to buy them where now they are
<br>
&quot;forced&quot; to buy $100+ 40 GB drives, soon to be (I'm sure 60 GB $100
<br>
drives). For some years manufacturers have worked fairly hard to ensure
<br>
that the cheapest drives they make to sell retail for around $100.  Even
<br>
so competition gradually pushes down the price of the cheapest
<br>
mass-market retail hard disk from thousands of dollars in the 80's (in
<br>
1980's dollars!) to maybe $80 today.
<br>
<p>Compare disk to memory, where there are far more manufacturers and
<br>
(aside from massive price fluctuations caused by supply side dimples)
<br>
absolute price of the cheapest components has come down remarkably.
<br>
Think of the price of 512 MB SDRAM DIMMS a couple of years ago, and the
<br>
cost of 64 or 128 MB DIMMS today.]
<br>
<p>So don't count on seeing much of a price reduction in CPU (top to
<br>
bottom), count on seeing a performance increase at constant cost with a
<br>
more or less constant minimum buy-in price (for the older technology)
<br>
and a consistent, much higher price for bleeding-edge technology. If a
<br>
price drop does occur, it will more likely be related to competition and
<br>
manufacturing scale than to improvements in VLSI scale.
<br>
<p>As for as what that increase (at constant cost) will be -- I believe
<br>
that the average performance doubling time is roughly 16 months
<br>
(somewhere between 12 and 18) although the actual doubling time is very
<br>
irregular with quantum jumps (new processor families) and then smooth
<br>
increases as they ramp up the clock and clean up the design.  Over four
<br>
years I'd believe anything from 2^5 = 32x down to 2^3 = 8x for CPU speed
<br>
alone, depending on whether the four year boundary begins and/or ends
<br>
before and/or after a quantum jump (which can yield as much as factor of
<br>
2 relative to clock).  I'd be very surprised if CPU speed &quot;only&quot;
<br>
increases by a factor of 5-6 over four years -- that would be a doubling
<br>
time of around 18 months (at the high side of the range) and we KNOW
<br>
that there will be The Great 64-Bit Crossover in the next year or two
<br>
(see e.g. the AMD &quot;processor roadmap&quot;) which will probably be worth most
<br>
of a factor of two alone.
