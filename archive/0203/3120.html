Subject: RE: Transcendental Fiction List
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Arthur C. Clarke's Childhood's End was already mentioned when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transcendental Fiction list idea was first proposed. That work certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describes a type of Singularity, albeit one with a rather underexplained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause. But I would like to propose that portions of Clarke's 3001: The
</em><br>
Final
<br>
<em>&gt; Odyssey (is that the right subtitle?) also qualify. While the book as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole tends to be more traditional SF, in which the year 3001 is &quot;the
</em><br>
future
<br>
<em>&gt; the way it used to be,&quot; the prologue describes a Singularity having
</em><br>
occurred
<br>
<em>&gt; to the unnamed alien race that is behind the powerful monoliths that were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; central to all the 2001-series novels. These beings had advanced through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stages to immortality, then species unity of mind, and eventually
</em><br>
embedding
<br>
<em>&gt; their minds into the very fabric of space. They also uplift (and judge)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lesser species. If you don't want to read the whole book, just read those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first few pages and about the last 10. Or better yet, read the whole
</em><br>
thing.
<br>
<p><p>You're right about the Prologue, and I hadn't thought about including it
<br>
mainly because the material about transcendence is confined to the Prologue.
<br>
The book itself has nothing to do with that.  So, in the list, I would
<br>
recommend the Prologue, but the whole thing.
<br>
<p><p>SPOILER!  DO NOT READ BEYOND THIS POINT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW 3001
<br>
TURNS OUT!
<br>
<p>Personally, I thought it was a terrible book.  How can Clarke say that these
<br>
beings have become so advanced and then have a computer virus written by
<br>
moshes able to disable the Monolith?  It's only slightly less shlockey than
<br>
Captain Kirk's talking AI's to apoplexy in 'Star Trek'.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Don't get me wrong.  I wouldn't exclude a book from the list simply because
<br>
I thought it wasn't very good.  I didn't really care that much for 'Queen
<br>
City Jazz', but unless I get some good arguments as to why not, I think it
<br>
has to go on.
