Hi,
<br>
<p>In the document that I posted (a link to) here recently, I defined three
<br>
kinds of intelligent self-modification: noetic, dynamical and substructural.
<br>
<p>Here are some more explicit comments on how these relate to my Novamente
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>In the beginning of that paper, I say:
<br>
<p>****
<br>
Suppose we have a system S, which is attempting to achieve goal G relative
<br>
to environment E.  Let S(t) denote the state of S at time t.
<br>
<p>There are three different senses in which we can say that S is
<br>
self-modifying.  These may be quantified as three different quantities
<br>
associated with a system S at a time t:
<br>
<p>· Intelligent noetic self-modification: the degree to which changes in the
<br>
system’s state correlate with increases in the system’s intelligence
<br>
· Intelligent dynamical self-modification: the degree to which changes in
<br>
the system’s dynamics correlate with increases in the system’s intelligence
<br>
· Intelligent substructural self-modification: the degree to which changes
<br>
in the system’s “pragmatically meaningful state space” correlate with
<br>
increases in the system’s intelligence
<br>
****
<br>
<p>The paper also gives a formal definition of intelligence, based on the
<br>
notion of intelligence as &quot;achievement of complex goals in complex
<br>
environments,&quot; and the quantification of complexity in terms of algorithmic
<br>
pattern.
<br>
<p>Now, any AI system worthy of the name will display intelligent noetic
<br>
self-modification.   All of Novamente’s cognitive dynamics are specifically
<br>
oriented toward this kind of self-modification: changing the state of the
<br>
system to make the system achieve its goals more effectively.
<br>
<p>Intelligent dynamical self-modification is to some extent implicit in
<br>
intelligent noetic self-modification, but, in Novamente, it becomes much
<br>
more significant when schema learning becomes a major part of the system’s
<br>
dynamics.  Schema learning is the mechanism by which Novamente explicitly
<br>
modifies procedures by which it does things.  When the system begins
<br>
modifying its own basic cognitive dynamics, then intelligent dynamical
<br>
self-modification becomes truly prevalent.
<br>
<p>Finally, intelligent substructural self-modification is happening all the
<br>
time in Novamente as well – but it gets more and more significant as schema
<br>
learning and basic-cognitive-dynamic learning rise.  And it becomes truly
<br>
overpowering when the system becomes able to rewrite its own sourcecode and
<br>
transform itself into something entirely different than it once was – in
<br>
this case it is modifying its own substructure in a direct and obvious way.
<br>
