Hi all,
<br>
<p>It's been a while since I have checked out this email list -- I figured
<br>
that I would pop back in to see what's happening with this interesting
<br>
group and possibly contribute.  Feel free to not read the rest of the
<br>
email -- it's just a brief summary of maybe relevant stuff I've been up
<br>
to.
<br>
<p>I've been spending much of my time working on my ugrad thesis -- which
<br>
is due on April 11, 2002.  I'm working with a molecular pharmacologist
<br>
[1] investigating the electrophysiology of specific types of receptor
<br>
subunit combinations in regards to certain drugs using a method called
<br>
patch clamping [2].  Basically this means that I slice up rat brains and
<br>
then using electrodes attached to individual neurons record their firing
<br>
rate (or related measures) while I change the drug composition of the
<br>
bath.  It can be really exhilarating when you get recordings of
<br>
real-live neurons but it takes a lot of dedication since it is a lot of
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>Recently I've been talking to a few program managers at DARPA about
<br>
transferring from the computer oriented project [3] I have been working
<br>
on during the summers to the new-ish BIO|INFO|MICRO program [4].  We'll
<br>
see if this arrangement can work out -- although I can rule out such a
<br>
change happening during the upcoming 8 months.
<br>
<p>Other than the neuroscience lab work the only other interesting thing
<br>
(in regards to this list) is the C# coding that I've been doing.  Maybe
<br>
someone remembers me talking about how much I thought that I would like
<br>
C# back in the summer?  Anyways, I've got two fairly functional projects
<br>
of mine posted to the web [5,6].  I've been using
<br>
runtime-code-generation, reflection and xml to a fair degree but I
<br>
haven't yet got into the XML-RPC/SOAP stuff yet.
<br>
<p>Recently someone though did contact me about joining a company or group
<br>
of people [7] that are building an AI down in California it seems.  I'm
<br>
suspecting that many on this list already know about this project.
<br>
<p>That's it for me.  I have read a little of the last couple months of the
<br>
SL4 archives -- neat stuff.  I noticed that there's a fellow Ottawa,
<br>
Ontario, Canada native on the list.  Cool. :-)
<br>
<p>Kind regards,
<br>
