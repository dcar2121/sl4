Ben, if you want to rephrase it, it's fine.  Obviously I have no authority
<br>
whatsoever to put the oath in canonical form.  But I'd like to see some
<br>
evidence that you're taking this seriously.  If you like, I'm not asking as
<br>
Eliezer Yudkowsky, Singularity specialist; I'm just asking as an ordinary
<br>
human being, one of many.  It is possible that your future actions may kill
<br>
me or worse.  I'm asking for a promise from you that you'll do your best to
<br>
avoid that.  It is unfortunately true that humanity does not presently have
<br>
social structures which could handle this problem collectively and that the
<br>
problem must be handled by someone anyway, but that doesn't diminish in the
<br>
slightest the staggering chutzpah of doing it.  Humanity is fully entitled
<br>
to demand certain promises from me, and with the declaration you just made,
<br>
we are entitled to demand those promises from you as well.  I didn't ask you
<br>
to swear that you would put 100% of your personal efforts into this.  I just
<br>
asked you to swear that, insofar as you did put in any efforts, you would
<br>
put in those efforts on behalf of humanity and not any other consideration. 
<br>
There is a difference between wanting to spend some time with your children,
<br>
and making a decision that permanently destroys a part of humanity's
<br>
potential because you made the decision on the basis of how it affected your
<br>
children and not how it affected the whole of humanity, should the issue
<br>
somehow arise.
<br>
<p>And before anyone in the audience even asks, these issues arise
<br>
*immediately* from the *declaration of intent* to do certain things,
<br>
regardless of whether you think Ben or I or whoever is probabilistically
<br>
likely to succeed in doing them.  Maybe I believe in Ben's AI design and
<br>
maybe I don't, but since I don't know the whole design, and I know that Ben
<br>
isn't the only person on the team, the *conservative* assumption from the
<br>
let's-protect-the-Singularity standpoint is to take Novamente's announced
<br>
intent seriously.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, oath or affirmation is a standard part of the procedure for
<br>
swearing in participants in life-critical social processes - judges, juries,
<br>
witnesses, political representatives.  It's not a &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;
<br>
thing.
