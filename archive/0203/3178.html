When Ben Goertzel mentioned:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is where we try to teach the system by interacting with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it in a shared perceptual environment.
</em><br>
<p>it got my imagination going.
<br>
<p>The Gallery.
<br>
&quot;This is what we call The Gallery&quot;, said Ben.  The Gallery was a large room
<br>
with numerous computer stations along the walls.  Several programmers were
<br>
working.  &quot;The Nova system can see and hear everything that happens in
<br>
here.&quot; he continued, &quot;Notice the cameras in the corners, giving Nova true
<br>
three dimensional vision.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Like people, I mean humans?&quot; I said.
<br>
&quot;Not exactly.  Humans don't have actual three dimensional vision.  Each eye
<br>
produces a two dimensional picture.  The combined stereoscopic vision is 2.5
<br>
dimensions at most.  Nova has a camera in all four corners of the room
<br>
providing true three dimensional vision.  We hard coded the visual cortex in
<br>
three dimensions by extending the design of the human visual cortex reverse
<br>
engineered by other researchers.&quot;
<br>
&quot;You mean real scientists?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Hey!  We're real scientists!&quot;
<br>
&quot;Sorry.  Why even have a Gallery?  Why not just hook it up to the internet?
<br>
Isn't there enough information there for all the intellectual stimulation it
<br>
would need?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Well, that depends.  If we wanted Nova to grow up to be a web site that
<br>
might work.  But we want Nova to be a person, so we want it to have
<br>
relationships with real people.  Take a look over here.&quot;  Ben crosses the
<br>
room and points out a computer station operated by a robotic arm.  The arm
<br>
is moving the mouse and clicking on links.  &quot;This is Nova's web access.  We
<br>
may eventually give Nova direct access but while she is still an infant we
<br>
thought this approach has advantages.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Can it type?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Oh yes, she hasn't shown much selectivity in web pages yet but we are very
<br>
optimistic.&quot;
<br>
&quot;So, bottom line, how long till approximately human level?&quot;
<br>
&quot;Barring unforeseen technical problems and continued funding, I would say 18
<br>
months.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Isn't that what you always say?&quot;
<br>
Ben frowns.
<br>
&quot;Sorry.&quot;
