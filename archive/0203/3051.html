</em><br>
<p>So don't, model a critter. Learn how to image it first. Or fiddle with

molecules, preferably ones useful to build faster computers.

<p>Um, if we're talking about human level intelligence people have been
<br>
claiming this for &gt;20 years. If you look at the actual system performance
<br>
of current architectures, you'll see that they're highly skewed (benchmark
<br>
XY, not AI), and hence are not a good estimate of human processing
<br>
equivalent (even if we had a good idea what a human processing equivalent
<br>
is, which we don't yet -- Kurzweil has been using the glass pipe, as
<br>
usually).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is so much work left to do to create a general intelligence, and all
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't believe genetic engineering is going to produce significant advances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in intelligence in the next 50 years.
</em><br>
<p>True. Given that you have generation iterations of about three decades,
<br>
plus acceptance time before it gets deployed widely, plus time before
<br>
enhanced people will start having an impact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, nanotech may happen in some very limited form but not enough to lead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a singularity without superhuman intelligence guiding it.
</em><br>
<p>We should get molecular circuitry in 3d bulk (computronium) in less than
<br>
two decades. We should get molecular memories (2d) in less than a decade,
<br>
2d computronium soon after.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I expect at least 20 years, probably more like 30 years for programming a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good enough general intelligence. I hope to be able to be a part of this,
</em><br>
<p>I do not see anybody who goes on two legs programming a general
<br>
intelligence at all. Creating boundary conditions for emergence of a seed,
<br>
yes. A seed without control, however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm just now finishing my CS study, I need to make some money somehow, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise I want to work on this.
</em><br>
<p>The longer you wait, the less time you will have. Of course, you will need
<br>
to get rid of the college debt first.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that's a very wild guess - just my intuition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another part of me says that we will continue as before, gradual improvement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in technology, no singularity. People will have enough of technology at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point. Research money will go into entertainment only.
</em><br>
<p>Lots of hardware innovation comes from entertainment. Resources to run
<br>
simulated game worlds and rendering them would seem to drive towards
<br>
parallelism.
