<em>&gt; However, computers are better viewed as amplifiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human abilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than as replacements for humans.  One human plus a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer may replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many humans at certain tasks (like generating 10^18
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or so steps in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Markov Process and sampling them appropriately), but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot forsee a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time when the human is entirely removed from this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equation until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (possibly when) computers are truly self aware and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can dream up useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even useless work to do on their own.
</em><br>
<p>My employer right now buys a lot of human thinking
<br>
power (represented as the present value of my
<br>
salary and benefits) and a little computer power
<br>
(represented by the 500MHz PC I'm typing on).
<br>
When an economic crossover occurs, I would expect
<br>
the ratio of spending to shift in favor of more
<br>
computer and less human.  I don't expect the
<br>
human component to disappear, and I don't require
<br>
'real AI' for the shift to happen.  For example,
<br>
my employer (Boeing) may develop a genetic
<br>
algorithm/monte carlo/optimizing wing design
<br>
program that replaces a bunch of engineers with
<br>
one engineer and a big linux cluster.
<br>
<p>A real example is my local supermarket installing
<br>
4 self-checkout units with one cashier to oversee
<br>
them.  More computers, less people.
<br>
<p>The point of the particular crossover I am tracking
<br>
is that for 'real AI' to get deployed as more
<br>
than a reasearch project, it needs to be competitive
<br>
with the cost of what it is replacing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, it isn't clear why these particular hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disk and memory ratios
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where chosen as part of the metric, 
</em><br>
<p>Lacking a 'real AI' algorithm that works, I used
<br>
the complexity of the human brain as an estimate
<br>
for how much storage will be required.  The numbers
<br>
I used were 10 bytes/synapse x 10^4 synapse/neuron x
<br>
10^11 neurons/brain = 10^4 Terabytes, which is 100x
<br>
the 100 Tflops processing rate.
<br>
<p>For human-like reaction times of ~1/4 second, I
<br>
assumed that you need 8 bits of active memory
<br>
for each 32 bit floating point operation, which
<br>
works out to 1 byte/Flop.  To get consistent cost
<br>
trend data, I want to keep the ratios of processor
<br>
power, memory, and storage the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To conclude, this seems to be a moderately naive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metric for systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparison and I wouldn't recommend that it be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely adopted:-)
</em><br>
<p>As soon as someone comes up with a better estimate
<br>
of computer requirements for running a 'real AI'
<br>
I'll adopt them, but in the mean time I consider
<br>
it useful to track computer cost trends regardless
<br>
of whether I've got the mix of components exactly
<br>
right.
<br>
