<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was reading the book “Conversations with a Mathematician” by algorithmic
<br>
information pioneer Gregory Chaitin today, and I found the following
<br>
passage:
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“[M]y personal opinion is that AI is not a mathematical problem, it’s an
<br>
engineering problem….  To me a human being is just a very complicated piece
<br>
of engineering that’s exquisitely well-suited for surviving in this world….
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“[I]t’s very often the case that theoreticians can show that in theory
<br>
there’s no way to solve a problem, but software engineers can find a clever
<br>
algorithm that usually works, or that usually gives you a good approximation
<br>
in a reasonable amount of time.  And I think that human intelligence is also
<br>
a little bit like that, and that it’s a matter of creeping up on it little
<br>
by little, a step at a time, until we can usually do a good job imitating
<br>
it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In fact I think that we may be almost halfway there, only we don’t realize
<br>
it, and that fifty years from now we’ll be close to a real AI, and then
<br>
people will wonder why anyone ever thought that it was difficult to create
<br>
an AI.  This AI won’t be the result of a theorem, it’ll be a mountain of
<br>
work, a giant engineering project that was built piece by piece, little by
<br>
little, just like what happens in Nature.  As the biologists say, God is a
<br>
tinkerer, he cobbles things together, he patches things up, he makes do with
<br>
what he has to create new forms of life by experimenting with sloppy little
<br>
changes one step at a time….
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We humans aren’t artistic masterpieces of design, we’re patched together,
<br>
bit by bit, and retouched every time that there’s an emergency and the
<br>
design has to be changed!  We’re strange, awkward creatures, but it all sort
<br>
of works!  And I think that an AI is also going to be like that….
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“[A] working AI is going to be like some kind of Frankenstein monster that’
<br>
s patched together bit by bit until one day we realize that the monster sort
<br>
of works, that it’s finally intelligent enough! “
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he overstates the case a little bit.  There is a kind of elegance
<br>
and order to complex adaptive systems with emergent behavior, which is
<br>
different from the elegance and order in modern mathematics.  But still, I
<br>
like his articulation of a point that has always seemed to me a piece of “AI
<br>
common sense,” but that yet seems to elude most academic AI theorists.
<br>
