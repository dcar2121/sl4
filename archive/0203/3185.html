<p>Santa's Workshop
<br>
<p>by Dani Eder
<br>
v0.2,  26 March 2002
<br>
<p>Abstract:
<br>
<p>An automated factory that can make copies of itself in
<br>
a short (~1 year) time and can switch to making useful
<br>
products would have major implications for mankind's
<br>
future.  From a finite input to produce the first
<br>
factory, a growing and infinite stream of products
<br>
could be produced.  NASA studied the feasibility of
<br>
such a factory in 1980, but the computer power to run
<br>
it was not available then.  It is now.  A start is
<br>
made at re-examining the concept and the issues it
<br>
raises
<br>
<p>----------------------------------- 
<br>
<p>NASA studied the idea of a self-reproducing factory
<br>
over 20 years ago (1) in the context of future space
<br>
missions.  In that context, transportation is
<br>
expensive.  Therefore it makes sense to send a 'seed
<br>
factory' to a destination such as the Moon or an
<br>
asteroid.  The seed makes copies of itself, which then
<br>
continue to reproduce exponentially until you have a
<br>
desired number of factories.  They then switch to
<br>
producing whatever product you wanted large quantities
<br>
of in the first place.  The estimated computer power
<br>
to run the factory, ~2GB memory and ~30GB storage, was
<br>
way out of reach then, and the concept received no
<br>
further attention.   Such computer power is well
<br>
within the reach of desktop PCs today, so it is time
<br>
to reconsider the concept.
<br>
<p>The NASA study was limited in scope in several areas. 
<br>
Only factories in space were considered due to NASA's
<br>
area of interest.  If such a factory can be built in
<br>
space, it should also be possible to build one on
<br>
Earth.  In fact, it should be easier since we already
<br>
know a lot more about designing machines to work here
<br>
on Earth.  In addition to ignoring Earthbound
<br>
factories, the factory design in the study merely
<br>
produced copies of itself on the Moon to show the
<br>
feasibility of reproduction.  The study did not
<br>
address what useful products the factory would
<br>
eventually make, nor did it address the idea of
<br>
starting with a simplified seed factory that uses a
<br>
subset of the machines and processes that later
<br>
generations of factories could use.  The study assumed
<br>
for the sake of analysis production of 100% of it's
<br>
own parts and 100% automated operation.  In a real
<br>
world system less than 100% values may make economic
<br>
sense, especially for a factory on Earth.  The
<br>
limitations in the original study should be addressed
<br>
by future work.
<br>
<p>The reproduction time of the factory on the Moon was
<br>
estimated at about 1 year.  If a reproducing factory
<br>
can be built on Earth, it should have approximately
<br>
the same reproduction time:  Less raw sunlight is
<br>
available on Earth for the solar panels producing
<br>
power, but the computer components will likely be
<br>
bought rather made, eliminating the whole electronics
<br>
manufacturing sector of the lunar factory.  From an
<br>
economic standpoint, 100% compound growth is a
<br>
phenomenal return rate.  After a factory has
<br>
reproduced enough times, mass quantities of goods can
<br>
be produced cheaply, hence the title of this article.
<br>
For example, a seed factory that runs on 100 KW of
<br>
solar panels is allowed to reproduce for 30 years. 
<br>
You now have 1 billion factories with a power output
<br>
100,000 GW, roughly 50 times the total electric output
<br>
of the planet today.
<br>
<p>There are a number of additional questions and issues
<br>
that should be addressed in future analysis of this
<br>
concept:
<br>
<p>(A)  Does a self-replicating factory have inherent
<br>
advantages over the industrial complex we have on
<br>
Earth with many specialized but physically distributed
<br>
factories?  By co-locating the factory components you
<br>
can cut transportation costs and automate the transfer
<br>
betweeen components.  On the other hand you lose the
<br>
benefits of resources (sunlight, ores) that are more
<br>
concentrated in certain locations on Earth than
<br>
others.
<br>
<p>(B)  Is there a simpler subset of machines and
<br>
processes for the 'seed factory' that can then build
<br>
the rest of the machines in the later generation
<br>
factories?  For example, could you start with a
<br>
milling machine, a mobile robot with an assortment of
<br>
hand-tool attachments, a solar panel, and a pile of
<br>
raw stock and proceed to make additional types robots,
<br>
machine tools, etc.  What would be the optimal growth
<br>
strategy for such a seed factory? 
<br>
<p>(C) What is the optimum fraction of self-replication? 
<br>
It may make sense to buy hard-to-make components (like
<br>
computer processors and hard disks) rather than making
<br>
them internally.  Even a fully automated factory can
<br>
order parts over the internet and have them delivered
<br>
as needed, and sell and ship products as needed to pay
<br>
for it's purchases.  The UPS guy may wonder, however,
<br>
why there are no cars in the parking lot.  A related
<br>
issue is how reliable the equipment needs to be vs.
<br>
maintenance overhead and the need to complete &gt;1 set
<br>
of new equipment before the original equipment wears
<br>
out to sustain reproduction and growth.  
<br>
<p>(D) What are the economic and social implications of
<br>
fast factory reproduction?  If you own the first
<br>
factory, you could end up owning a major fraction of
<br>
the world's economic output.  Of course, automation is
<br>
being introduced progressively into non-replicating
<br>
factories too.
<br>
<p>(E) How do you analyze, design, and simulate the
<br>
production process?  Like any mass-produced item,  the
<br>
factories would benefit in cost from designing it
<br>
once, then producing many copies.  Determining the
<br>
optimum amount of effort to spend on design may be a
<br>
challenge.  If the factories grow in number faster
<br>
than the discount rate you are using for economic
<br>
analysis, then the present value of the future
<br>
factories is very large.
<br>
<p>(F) Does it make sense start with a partially
<br>
reproducing and/or partially automated factory and
<br>
progressively improve it?  How will such an evolving
<br>
system interact with the rest of the world’s economic
<br>
system, which is also evolving towards greater
<br>
automation?
