<p>
Hi,
<br>
<p>A couple weeks ago I posted here two versions of a brief informal paper on
<br>
&quot;defining intelligence and self-modification.&quot;
<br>
<p>I just now found time to revisit those draft papers.
<br>
<p>One key point that came up: As two people separately pointed out to me, my
<br>
definition of &quot;substructural self-modification&quot; was essentially meaningless.
<br>
Well, you win some, you lose some.
<br>
<p>In revisiting the more mathematical variant of the paper, I found myself
<br>
irresistably drawn to using some special Novamente-style notation.  For this
<br>
reason, the current version of that paper no longer stands alone; I've
<br>
instead made it an appendix in our someday-to-appear treatise on Novamente.
<br>
I took the old draft off the Web.
<br>
<p>However, the nonmathematical variant of the paper has also been revised a
<br>
bit, and exists online at:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.goertzel.org/papers/IntelligenceAndSelfModification.htm">http://www.goertzel.org/papers/IntelligenceAndSelfModification.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p>I hope it was clear to everyone that, by using math in formulating these
<br>
ideas in the previously posted draft, I was not trying to give any undue
<br>
impression of rigor or &quot;definitiveness&quot; of the ideas.  These are definitely
<br>
highly speculative ideas, and my use of math in this context is purely
<br>
because I sometimes find math formalism useful for clarifying my own
<br>
thoughts to myself.  For instance, it was the attempted math. formalization
<br>
that made it clear that my previous attempt to clarify intuitive idea of
<br>
&quot;substructural self-modification&quot; was meaningless ;)
<br>
<p>Two ways of measuring &quot;degree of self-modification&quot; that still appear to me
<br>
to be clearly meaningful are:
<br>
<p>1) noetic intelligent self-modification.  By this I mean changes in the
<br>
system's structure that are causally related with increases in the system's
<br>
intelligence
<br>
<p>2) dynamical intelligent self-modification.  By this I mean changes in the
<br>
system's dynamical behavior that are causally related with increases in the
<br>
system's intelligence.
<br>
<p>What I was trying to capture with the now-defunct definition of
<br>
&quot;substructural self-modification&quot; was something a little different: the
<br>
degree by which the system modifies its own “basic components.”
<br>
<p>This intuitive concept is certainly relatively simple.  For instance, if a
<br>
human learns new thought processes, this modifies his brain’s dynamics to a
<br>
certain extent.  On the other hand, if a human augments his brain with a
<br>
neurochip that enables him to do arithmetic and algebra at high speeds, this
<br>
modifies his knowledge base and dynamics to a very large extent.
<br>
<p>One would like to say that the neurochip expands the dynamical repertoire of
<br>
the system in some fundamental sense.  Once the chip is there, the system
<br>
can do a lot of things it could not have done otherwise: for instance,
<br>
compute 1757775555*466464444 in a tenth of a second.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it is not clear to me at this point how  this is really
<br>
qualitatively different from dynamical self-modification.  After all,
<br>
learning a new cognitive skill allows one to carry out activities that could
<br>
not have been carried out otherwise.
<br>
<p>As far as I can tell at the moment, the difference seems to be mainly one of
<br>
extent.  A neurochip suddenly allows a huge amount of new “implicit
<br>
dynamics.”   It thus allows the formation of all sorts of system states that
<br>
would have been impossible otherwise.
<br>
<p>In the physical world, without modifying its basic components, there is
<br>
going to be a ceiling to the intelligence that any finite system can assume.
<br>
“Substructural self-modification” in the intuitive sense is thus necessary
<br>
for dynamical and noetic self-modification to continue beyond a certain
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>It seems to be possible formalize the notion of substructural
<br>
self-modification, but only by taking a point of view that isnt entirely
<br>
satisfactory to me.   For instance, one can consider a physical system in
<br>
terms of an hierarchy of abstract state machines M1, M2,…,Mk, where each
<br>
state of Mi is defined as a set of states of Mi-1, and the transitions
<br>
between states of Mi are consistent with the transitions permitted between
<br>
states of Mi-1.   In the case of a computer program we may have, roughly
<br>
speaking,
<br>
<p>M1 = computer hardware
<br>
M2 = operating system
<br>
M3 = programming language
<br>
M4 = AI program
<br>
M5 = Easily mutable parts of AI program
<br>
<p>Generally speaking, intelligent modifications to lower levels of the
<br>
hierarchy will tend to cause higher degrees of noetic and dynamical
<br>
self-modification.  “Substructural” self-modification as in the neurochip
<br>
example occurs at a lower level than modification of learning algorithms via
<br>
experiential adaptation.  In Novamente, for instance, modifications to the
<br>
underlying source code occur at a lower level than modifications to schema
<br>
operating with a fixed-source-code system.
