<p>
Are there any lists out there of singularity-aware or more broadly
<br>
transcendental SF?  I've seen some good nonfiction lists about accelerating
<br>
change and related topics - John Smart has a fairly comprehensive list.  But
<br>
I think that sometimes fiction can be a more powerful way of conveying the
<br>
ideas of radical change than the usually just intellectual descriptions in
<br>
the nonfiction I've read.
<br>
<p>If there is already such a list, with shorter works, as well as novels,
<br>
would someone point me to it?  If not, then someone ought to--  You really
<br>
thought I was gonna say it didn't you?  I read the thread about people
<br>
saying that 'someone ought to do something-or-other' and I agree that the
<br>
person saying that should be the one.  So, if such a list does not exist, I
<br>
will begin making it.  (Even some on this list may have missed some good
<br>
storys in this vein.  If you haven't read any or all of the four stories
<br>
that Asimov's has published in the last year! that take the singularity as
<br>
their subject you have missed some really great work.  This David Stross is
<br>
pretty impressive)  Even if there is a list of novels, I think there also
<br>
should be one for shorter works.  SF has done much of it's best work in the
<br>
novella and novelette forms and still does.  But if there is a list of
<br>
novels, then maybe I can integrate shorter works in the same vein into it.
<br>
<p>But I'll want some input from you'll to try to make it comprehensive, and to
<br>
hash out some of the inevitable borderline cases.  That's why I use the term
<br>
'transcendental' instead of just 'singularity-aware'.  If a story such as
<br>
'Blood Music' for instance - which doesn't use the term 'singularity' can't
<br>
make the list because it isn't technically 'singularity-aware', then I would
<br>
have to give up before I began.
<br>
<p>There's also a selfish component to this project.  I have only had access to
<br>
Analog and Asimov's in recorded form or in Braille until very recently; I
<br>
just discovered this morning that most of the content of 'Eidolon' is
<br>
available online now - according to Greg Egan anyhow, so hopefully, I'll
<br>
have some interesting stuff to look through.  But I want to find out about
<br>
good stuff from other mags such as 'Interzone', 'F&amp;SF', among others I could
<br>
list that I have not been able to read.  So those of you who have read some
<br>
of these should make suggestions for shorter works that you think should be
<br>
on the list.  A brief synopsis would be appreciated, as well as the date of
<br>
the issue.  If it sounds promising, I will try to get hold of it online, or
<br>
failing that, at one of those libraries with wood pulp stuff in them. (-:
<br>
I'm banking on there not being very many really good ones, so I shouldn't
<br>
have to scan in hundreds of stories; because if I'm making this list, then I
<br>
feel I should vet the potential candidates for inclusion.
<br>
<p>I want to keep the sl level as high as possible, partly to keep the list
<br>
manageable, but mostly to keep it focused on the kind of radical transitions
<br>
that the word 'singularity' connotes.  I'm not saying that there has to BE a
<br>
singularity in the story, but I think it ought to be close.  I'm not sure
<br>
about stories that simply mention the word 'singularity' or 'transcendence'
<br>
but don't do anything with them in the story - a casual conversation among
<br>
characters about why it's a stupid idea probably shouldn't make it; but one
<br>
in which the idea is recognized but where transcendence does not occur for
<br>
some reason should perhaps maybe be included.  I want input on this, also.
<br>
<p>One important thing, though.  I don't think that the transcendence has to
<br>
occur in a realistic way.  If only what are considered realistic paths are
<br>
allowed, then 'Childhood's End' wouldn't make it - one of the best in this
<br>
subgenre - and 'Blood Music' probably wouldn't either.  And if neither of
<br>
those can qualify, then forget the whole thing.  The idea is to FEEL
<br>
transcendence, not to just read an intellectual discussion.
<br>
<p>A Digression:
<br>
<p>I first encountered the idea of a singularity in Vinge's Marooned in Real
<br>
Time'.  It was Della's telling Will what she thought happened to humans in
<br>
the 23rd century.  I'll never forget that moment!  Another jolt in the same
<br>
novel was the all-too-brief description that Tanz Blumenthal gave to Will
<br>
about his life just before he got bobbled.  Wow!  Nonfiction books just
<br>
can't do that kind of thing.  (I once participated in a discussion in the
<br>
rec.arts.sf.written newsgroup entitled 'Why Vernor Vinge Ruined Science
<br>
Fiction' or something similar.  I didn't create the thread, and I wouldn't
<br>
go quite that far - I've read some pretty damn good stuff since MIRT, but I
<br>
would say that he did ruin a lot of it.  Reading 'Analog' for me has become
<br>
like stepping into a time warp back to the 1950s or '60s, with VERY few
<br>
pitifully few exceptions.  Asimov's has published more 'singularity-aware'
<br>
fiction in the last year than 'Analog' has in the last 15 years.  Gardner
<br>
Dozois even put out an anthology severall years ago called 'Isaac Asimov's
<br>
Transcendental Tales' or something like that.  I've probably read most if
<br>
not all the stuff in it, since I've been reading Asimov's for over twenty
<br>
years, but I'll certainly go through it for list candidates.  'Analog
<br>
wouldn't have enough material to begin such an anthology.  Yah, they
<br>
published MIRT, but that was a long time ago.
<br>
<p>End Digression
<br>
<p>Anyway, my point is that an appeal to the imagination can be much more
<br>
powerful than the necessarily more constrained, more 'realistic' discussions
<br>
of even good books such as 'Engines of Creation' or 'Mind Children'.
<br>
<p>So send those suggestions to me..  I'll put a preliminary list together
<br>
shortly and then we can talk it out.
<br>
<p>I hope the list moderator will allow this discussion here, but if not, then
<br>
I guess I'll take it private.  I think it would be fun though to have it on
<br>
the list.
