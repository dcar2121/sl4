Hi,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Referring to a transactional paradigm for AI)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is same conclusion I came to when 'playing' with AI designs.  Once I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got down to actually imagining how I was going to monitor, to debug, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjust the parameters on-the-fly, to recover-from-failure, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...  well, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of unworkable 'mind' ideas got tossed out.  What was left had an - how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can I say it - unglamorous overhead.  But I thought it was *doable*.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  So one winds up with a multilayered design approach.  An unglamorous,
<br>
contemporary-software-engineering-ish layer, and then on top of that, a
<br>
layer that does implement the structures and dynamics of mind.  For us to
<br>
get the relationship and interaction between these layers &quot;right&quot; (for our
<br>
AI design) took a long time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Of course, the transaction architecture is just a start, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah... but an important start.  Without that start, you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backtrack and retrofit everything once you tried to 'go distributed'.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, because of our past experience building a distributed Webmind, now we
<br>
have built our 1-machine Novamente in such a way that only a very small
<br>
number of objects will need to be modified when Novamente goes the way of
<br>
Webmind and gets distributed...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The bottom line seems to be: No one is going to supply an off-the-shelf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; testing/monitoring package suitable for distributed Real AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purposes.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will have to build one ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yep.  A &quot;Console&quot; for Real AI.  Gotta have it.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that an AIConsole or something like it is a must-have, and we had a
<br>
graphical tool like this for use with the Webmind AI Engine.  It was very
<br>
cool, and made playing with the system much easier.  (&quot;Webmind Explorer&quot;, we
<br>
called it.)
<br>
<p>What we have now isn't exactly a AIConsole but serves a similar purpose.  We
<br>
call it wmshell (should be nmshell I guess, but the name is historical ;).
<br>
<p>It's a Linux shell customized for experimenting with Novamente.  So you can
<br>
send commands to a Novamente instance in real-time, get information back,
<br>
etc.
<br>
<p>In our architecture, one would implement a graphical AIConsole by having it
<br>
issue and receive wmshell commands, I suppose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would be a good idea to make this as 'general' a solution as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow flexibility in adapting as our AI theories of 'what works'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and thrown out 8D).
</em><br>
<p>Well, my main point in this regard is: The first version of a tool like this
<br>
is inevitably going to be only half-usable.
<br>
<p>It's *interaction with the developers using the tool in the context of
<br>
creating and running and debugging an AI system* that will allow the second
<br>
version to be really good.
<br>
<p>So, a *general* tool of this type will only be creatable if, while creating
<br>
it, there are *teams associated with more than one AI project* actively
<br>
using the tool.
<br>
<p>Another way to say this is: The detailed requirements for such a tool are
<br>
hard to articulate.  They're essentially *impossible* to articulate until
<br>
one has a largely-designed, partially-completed AI system on one's hands,
<br>
demanding the tool for its development.  And even so, one will always fail
<br>
in articulating them completely at first; new and important requirements
<br>
will always come out in the course of using the tool's first version.
<br>
<p>If it were possible to coordinate the development of an AIConsole between
<br>
two Real AI projects ... well, that might be a bigger miracle than actually
<br>
creating Real AI ;) ... but who knows!!
<br>
<p>On a less nitty-gritty level, Eliezer and I have talked before about
<br>
creating a series of &quot;IQ tests&quot; for different phases of seed AI development,
<br>
which would be applicable to both of our AI systems.  I've also talked to
<br>
Shane Legg, currently involved with Peter Voss's Adaptive Intelligence
<br>
project, about this.  This seems to me more likely to happen than the
<br>
development of a general-purpose testing tool, but... who knows... ;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not to mention it being easier to start a commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-shoot of the product if it is coded fairly generally.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have enough painful business experience to know that making a
<br>
commercial product to be broadly marketed is a whole different task from
<br>
building a tool for use within 1 or 2 or 3 particular projects....
<br>
<p>However, I agree that if a specialized AIConsole tool is well-built, it may
<br>
be possible to take core components of it, and use them to fill out the back
<br>
end of a subsequent product, whose overall design is based on an analysis of
<br>
the requirements of a broader range of customers.
<br>
<p>Generally, though, starting a business based on a technology rather than a
<br>
concretely observed pressing customer need is a recipe for trouble (of a
<br>
type with which I'm very familiar!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Hence, it seems likely that each would-be Real AI project, as it goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; distributed, will have to tackle this problem on its own!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The sooner we tackle it the better IMO.  You mentioned many times, when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recounting the difficulties/fun of the Webmind project, that 'parameter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tuning' was difficult and time-consuming.  The Console concept is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just-the-thing to make this easy(ier).  You could also use it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pound-away
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the models with thousands of test scenarios.  And as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debugging tool: to
</em><br>
<p>I agree, this stuff is important.  Our wmshell tool is a start, for our
<br>
specialized purposes, but we're well aware that it's only a start!
