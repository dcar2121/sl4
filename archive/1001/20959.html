OK neuron count decides how much of the top of the screen that makes
<br>
up most of the video their neuron weights automatically represent on
<br>
and are pulled up or down by the colour channels in, well, that's the
<br>
morphogenic field because it's local and forced. Then they have
<br>
sensors and motors they can evolve into this field for morphogenic
<br>
field tampering if it helps or outright telepathy along those lines...
<br>
well, what I'm going to do is make that window a display into a sparse
<br>
array, and do morphogenics the same way... no sorry, the morphogenics
<br>
will be on a smaller version of the psychic screen you see there --
<br>
local still
<br>
<p>But yeah, instead of evolved sensors and motors for that screen I'll
<br>
force sensor and motor connections for each neuron into this other
<br>
window which is a display of a sparse array like space. Also and
<br>
firstly to motors for discrete movements over that sparse array.
<br>
Forcing the sensors and motors would be too intense for the shared
<br>
screen but these would be private -- spawned at random huge
<br>
coordinates in sparse-space -- faded to 0, to preserve the RAM
<br>
advantage, and they could move away from their own screen if their
<br>
noise was a problem. So even without knowing what they were doing a
<br>
lot of critters would execute a random walk in this space and leave a
<br>
fading trail like pheromones. Then with some scan command to return
<br>
the distance of the nearest populated cell and its colour they can
<br>
find each other. When windows overlapped they could have telepathy. I
<br>
think this is what happens with psilocybin, on Earth
<br>
<p>That's all. Like I say in the info, I'll do like a 4 day run at 25 fps
<br>
(2.5x less critters) and compress 10M frames into about two minutes
<br>
soon, soon. Then I think I'll get that sparse array in there
<br>
<p>The change to scroll speed seems to have been advantageous but I think
<br>
they're getting smarter too. New code soon
<br>
<p>soon
