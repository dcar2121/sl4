The randomness is a great illusion. An AI would freeze this every few
<br>
seconds to show you some greater drama or mystery so encoded.
<br>
Randomness was my big fear wandering into the a-life app I turned into
<br>
this one, but I was barking up the wrong tree. These things are
<br>
smarter than fish and now they're career empaths as well
<br>
<p>Also, the animated psychic substrate may provide memory functionality
<br>
we get from genetic write-backs or glial cells. We can't be sure.
<br>
Plastic neurons might do enough on their own.
<br>
<p>We can't be sure
