<p>
OK guys this isn't funny or cool, alright. In Fall '08 I went and
<br>
camped out alone in a meadow near a town I lived in once and the CIA
<br>
stuck a chip in my head that night. Next few weeks I had the
<br>
occasionally pain or sensation of warmth in my head and I thought I
<br>
could hear sort of 'testing, testing' style shit. It certainly
<br>
occurred to me that I had been tampered with overnight. From then on
<br>
I'd hear the occasional wet mouth noise in some direction where it
<br>
couldn't have come from, but only every few weeks, and I think the
<br>
occasional tiny kiss. Which is really the problem right now
<br>
<p>These tiny kisses are its big theme at the moment, this implant, which
<br>
has lit up like a Christmas tree since 2010 started. Oh my god. So I
<br>
greeted the new year with some wonderful trip and they were I guess
<br>
trying to break into it with this thing -- I talk to aliens when I
<br>
take enough drugs and I think that's what they're most worried about.
<br>
Anyway I must have ignored anything neutral or malevolent it did, this
<br>
implant, because I was sooo high. But then it got my attention
<br>
claiming to be from aliens or indeed to be the fungus I have in my
<br>
sinus right now. Either of which would have been cooler than they
<br>
would have been shitty
<br>
<p>But after two or three days of being in love with my new alien
<br>
implant, the first few days of 2010, it gave me electroshock while I
<br>
was in bed the night of the 4th or 5th then started being really mean
<br>
after that. Basically it makes faces in my head that's the main thing,
<br>
and I think that's its biggest ability and probably selected for
<br>
because it's hard to relate, so I am gonna try now. Yes, it makes the
<br>
feeling in my head of faces being made, not like with my own face but
<br>
maybe with the area of my brain I use to make out faces real people
<br>
are making, people I can actually see. So they are these sarcastic
<br>
faces like it's gonna be in trouble now or has to run to tell someone,
<br>
or like it's leering down at me or yes, kisses, accompanied usually by
<br>
an actual kissing sound, small. But these faces are more common than
<br>
any sounds or words. By a factor of like a hundred. It makes -tons- of
<br>
these faces but it only selects from about ten different ones which
<br>
does make each of them more annoying.
<br>
<p>With me it's super hyper and goes constantly and I think it's because
<br>
I smoke pot and they figure that means I forget fast, also can
<br>
tolerate some lower rate that would drive a non-pot-smoker totally
<br>
insane. Also this is Canada not the motherland so maybe they do want
<br>
me to go mucker. I don't know but it is crazy fast super hyper right
<br>
now and every night for the last two nights and tonight starting at
<br>
sunset... I guess because I'm a night person
<br>
<p>If you are radical enough, go hard enough in life, the governor kicks
<br>
in. You were doing 180 and you didn't take your foot off the gas but
<br>
it drops to 110 and it's like you broke something. I've never owned a
<br>
car but a good friend showed me this and it's another lesson I just
<br>
ignored. Now there's a chip in my head. Oh my god
<br>
<p>If you google it you'll see the disinfo, psy-ops and FUD surrounding
<br>
the subject so I ask you why is it there if this isn't what they're
<br>
doing? The money disappeared in Iraq has gone into the head of Flamoot
<br>
to slow him down and make fun of him and hurt and abuse his
<br>
personality and you know, I tried radically sexualizing the implant
<br>
into some kind of anonymous homoerotic glory-hole thing, and that just
<br>
made them start using it for sexual harassment which they didn't do
<br>
before!! GOD
<br>
<p>I want it removed. That's all I guess. Thank for sharing this much with me
