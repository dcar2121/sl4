Hi Greythumb a-life cultivators and others
<br>
<p>I'm sorry to plug your inboxes with this but this is my best video of
<br>
a telepathic-critterdrug experiment or run, or series of experiments,
<br>
so far. A lot of people have asked what exactly they're looking at --
<br>
this is not as extreme a time-lapse as prior recordings, particularly
<br>
the last third or so, so you should be able to actually see what's
<br>
going on. To make sure, I freeze-framed the racial movie or psychic
<br>
screen for much longer than they're used to. (Starts about halfway
<br>
through) Er with interesting results. For one thing, they stopped
<br>
breeding for a while near the end. Well, see the notes with the video
<br>
for caveats and addenda, but what I chiefly expect to see (I haven't
<br>
looked yet) is some kind of meme exchange, negotiation, or
<br>
socialization. I think those abilities are indigenous to neurons.
<br>
Maybe to mycelium. Please try my software
<br>
<p>Next video will be at half this speed with the movie in motion so that
<br>
it wraps back to the scroll point about once a second (1900fps, movie
<br>
is 1024 frames and plays in two directions). So you will see 12 frames
<br>
from each playback which is plenty to make out any trends.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind this video is still pretty much what critters from
<br>
regular Critterding would do with all this. I'd really encourage
<br>
anyone to start evolving random animals in telepathic-critterdrug
<br>
since these were rewired for it after evolving in the parent app. I
<br>
want to see what those would do. Rather than these per se. Well they
<br>
can fight. You can see how there's only a little window at the bottom
<br>
of the screen their morphogenic fields don't reach (less total
<br>
writes). That's because they have a ton of neurons already. They don't
<br>
know what it means like ones that grew to that size on the same
<br>
substrate would. That's my thing
<br>
<p>I'll release the code with some switches and different animation modes
<br>
for the screen as well as an option to enforce or evolve each of them
<br>
(propagation rules) with energy rewards, which is gonna be awesome.
<br>
The scroll when it's moving is so they'll understand which cells are
<br>
adjacent but I've thought of a lot of more interesting ways to do that
<br>
now
<br>
