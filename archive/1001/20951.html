Below I will explain an easy way to possibly get the Singularity Institute For
<br>
AI many thousands
<br>
or millions of dollars, and the first $100,000 is being doubled by charity
<br>
matching.
<br>
Specificially my writing below contains an unofficial draft of a proposal to a
<br>
very
<br>
rich and generous organization that should be interested if its properly
<br>
explained.
<br>
Please help rewrite this so a formal proposal can be made.
<br>
<p>Older version of this same proposal is at:
<br>
<a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/mindx/frame.html?main=/mindx/show_thread.php?rootID%3D171434">http://www.kurzweilai.net/mindx/frame.html?main=/mindx/show_thread.php?rootID%3D171434</a>
<br>
<p>I'll quote Bill Gates (owner of Microsoft) in a forbes.com news article (linked
<br>
from his webpage)
<br>
about him, titled &quot;Ruthless Philanthropy&quot;:
<br>
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/06/23/gates-philanthropy-foundation-tech-gates08-cx_ec_0623philanthropy.html">http://www.forbes.com/2008/06/23/gates-philanthropy-foundation-tech-gates08-cx_ec_0623philanthropy.html</a>
<br>
<p>[quote]Ask Bill Gates what advice he'd offer the next U.S. president to improve
<br>
American competitiveness
<br>
and innovation, and he gives a wry chuckle. &quot;I tend to think more about
<br>
improving the entire world as
<br>
opposed to relative positions,&quot; he told Forbes.com. &quot;Otherwise you could say,
<br>
'Hey, World War II was
<br>
great because the U.S. was in its strongest relative position when that was
<br>
over.' &quot;[/quote]
<br>
<p>[quote]he's going after Big Problems: diseases that kill children, illiteracy,
<br>
hunger.
<br>
<p>Of course even if the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation winds up spending about
<br>
$100 billion--roughly
<br>
the combination of its current assets along with the existing fortunes of the
<br>
Gates family and pal
<br>
Warren Buffett--the problems Gates is tackling are achingly big.[/quote]
<br>
<p>It says Bill Gates is in the process of spending over $30,000,000,000 on charity
<br>
(see the numbers below).
<br>
Thats over 300,000 times more than the <a href="http://intelligence.org/challenge">http://intelligence.org/challenge</a> charity is
<br>
trying to get people to
<br>
donate (I'll explain their purpose below), and every dollar donated to
<br>
<a href="http://intelligence.org/challenge">http://intelligence.org/challenge</a>
<br>
is matched 1 to 1 to become a 2 dollar donation, until February 28 (8 weeks from
<br>
now).

<br>
<p>[quote]What We Fund
<br>
Our Community Grants program supports projects that:
<br>
<p>* Are in alignment with one or more of the Community Grants focus areas
<br>
* Are proposed by a 501(c)3 nonprofit, tribe, or government entity
<br>
* Serve residents of Washington state or the metro Portland area
<br>
* Include the priority populations of youth, families, Native Americans, and
<br>
other communities
<br>
of color. Within these populations, a majority of those who would benefit from
<br>
the work should be
<br>
low income.
<br>
* Show evidence of sufficient organizational capacity to successfully carry out
<br>
the proposed work
<br>
and achieve the proposed project outcomes-or include a viable plan for
<br>
increasing capacity in
<br>
order to complete the work
<br>
* Leverage partnerships with public or other private funders[/quote]
<br>
<p>I recommend everyone send a copy of the following to the &quot;Bill &amp; Melinda Gates
<br>
Foundation&quot; and rich
<br>
software businesses, or if you are more knowledgeable on the subject, maybe you
<br>
could write, or convince
<br>
<a href="http://intelligence.org">http://intelligence.org</a> to write, a proposal on that webpage for it

<br>
<p>[quote]To the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation,
<br>
as the leader of the software industry, I'm sure you're aware of the
<br>
exponentially fast progress
<br>
being made in artificial intelligence, in simulating smarter and smarter
<br>
animals,
<br>
and in robotics (like that Asimo robot that walks up and down stairs and serves
<br>
drinks),
<br>
so you must be aware that we are approaching Human level artificial intelligence
<br>
software
<br>
that can think for itself, join the military like a Terminator robot could, or
<br>
help with research,
<br>
or whatever it wanted to do, and what we do in these next few years or decades
<br>
will strongly
<br>
influence what it chooses to do, if it chooses to fight us or help us, therefore
<br>
I request
<br>
that you take advantage of the charity matching (1 dollar becomes 2 dollars, up
<br>
to $100,000)
<br>
until February 28, to the charity for the only organization whose primary
<br>
purpose is to prepare
<br>
the Earth for such advanced artificial intelligence and other global risks, and
<br>
to research
<br>
better ways to do those things.
<br>
<p>Millions of people are dieing of Malaria (one of your preferred charities), but
<br>
a much smaller
<br>
donation to the Singularity Institute For Artificial Intelligence (multiplied by
<br>
2) is much
<br>
more cost effective per life saved, on average, just in case bad things were
<br>
going to happen
<br>
from very smart artificial intelligence. Malaria kills millions of children. If
<br>
Human-level
<br>
artificial intelligence is done the wrong way, it could kill billions.
<br>
<p>You may think theres only a 1 in 1000 chance of that happening, but its still a
<br>
good gamble.
<br>
A billion lives divided by 1000 is a million lives on average. You got where you
<br>
are today
<br>
by being a good gambler. Please look into the possibility of these dangers,
<br>
and similar long-term global dangers at <a href="http://lifeboat.com">http://lifeboat.com</a> which also each have
<br>
a charity.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, this organization could effectively make use of up to 100 million
<br>
dollars,
<br>
but any amount would help. Its a small organization that hires geniuses to do
<br>
abstract thinking,
<br>
and they live on very small amounts of money so they can hire a maximum number
<br>
of geniuses
<br>
to think about these problems. They say $100,000 (multiplied by 2) would fund
<br>
their operation
<br>
for an entire year. Thank you.

<br>
<p>I don't know if it will work, but theres a small chance it will work, so the way
<br>
I see it,
<br>
multiply that small chance by whatever donation he might make, and that is what
<br>
I've accomplished
<br>
in the few minutes it took me to write this and copy it to a few places. I'm
<br>
explaining this
<br>
so other people can learn how to push money around without having any of their
<br>
own,
<br>
and generally to be more resourceful and strategic, like an artificial
<br>
intelligence would be.
<br>
<p>While I don't like the Digital Rights/Restrictions Management (DRM) in many
<br>
Microsoft products,
<br>
or the many bugs left in abandoned older softwares, when Bill Gates decides to
<br>
do something,
<br>
he is very effective at doing it, and his new goal is saving the world as much
<br>
as he can.
<br>
These 2 organizations I wrote above are a perfect match for eachother to get a
<br>
high
<br>
effectiveness per dollar, and that's what he's looking for. To everybody, please
<br>
copy this
<br>
text to many people, to forums where the subject is relevant, and most
<br>
importantly,
<br>
find someone who can write up a more official and detailed proposal to
<br>
