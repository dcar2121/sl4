The Foresight Institute, an organization close to the Singularity
<br>
Institute, is holding their 2010 conference
<br>
(<a href="http://www.foresight.org/conf2010/">http://www.foresight.org/conf2010/</a>) at the Sheraton Palo Alto Hotel
<br>
this January 16-17. Here is the blurb from the website of the
<br>
conference:
<br>
<p>&quot;   Join us in for an exciting conference focused on the Synergy of
<br>
Molecular Manufacturing and general Artificial Intelligence and
<br>
celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of Foresight. Register
<br>
online here. The two day conference rate is $175 with discounts for
<br>
early registration!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several rapidly-developing technologies have the potential to
<br>
undergo an exponential takeoff in the next few decades, causing as
<br>
much of an impact on economy and society as the computer and
<br>
networking did in the past few. Chief among these are molecular
<br>
manufacturing and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Key in the
<br>
takeoff phenomenon will be the establishment of strong positive
<br>
feedback loops within and between the technologies. Positive feedback
<br>
loops leading to exponential growth are nothing new to economic
<br>
systems. At issue is the value of the exponent: since the Industrial
<br>
Revolution, economies have expanded at rates of up to 7% per year;
<br>
however, computing capability has been expanding at rates up to 70%
<br>
per year, in accordance with Moore’s Law. If manufacturing and
<br>
intellectual work shifted into this mode, the impact on the economy
<br>
and society would be profound. The purpose of this symposium is to
<br>
examine the mechanisms by which this might happen, and its likely
<br>
effects.&quot;
