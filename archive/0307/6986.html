<em>&gt;  &gt; Looks worthless except for those interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping up with popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; error. 
</em><br>
<p>I think the articles I read do some good in exposing
<br>
people to varieties of growth curves.  We here on the
<br>
SL4 list are comfortable with an AI-based Singularity,
<br>
where the curve trends upward, then takes an abrupt
<br>
turn vertically upward.
<br>
<p>The eclectic layman (which is the Whole Earth
<br>
Review's audience) is in the range of SL0-SL2.
<br>
<p>Their ideas about technology might be like:
<br>
<p>There's progress in some technologies, but life's
<br>
been getting worse in other areas
<br>
<p>or:
<br>
<p>There's progress in technology, but it's a steady
<br>
improvement (linear)
<br>
<p>Some people think in terms of Moore's Law or
<br>
other expressions of exponential growth, but
<br>
the implications of that are hard for the average
<br>
person to think through.
<br>
<p>Actual growth curves that I've looked at such
<br>
as population, manufacturing productivity, and
<br>
computer power/$ are following curves that are
<br>
closer to hyperbolic than exponential.  That
<br>
means there is an asymptote in time at which
<br>
the curve will either go vertical, or break the
<br>
curve.
<br>
<p>To the extent that the WER issue exposes an
<br>
audience to the ideas of faster growth curves
<br>
and their implications, it does good.
<br>
<p>Bruce Sterling's article about stopping science
<br>
in it's tracks is just silly.  IBM all by itself
<br>
has enough R&amp;D power to maintain progress in
<br>
the semiconductor/computer arena.  Does anyone
<br>
think they can change IBM's internal motto from
<br>
'THINK' to 'DON'T THINK'?
<br>
<p>Short of the Khmer Rouge solution (kill all the
<br>
intellectuals), progress won't be stopped.  And
<br>
we won't implement such a solution because we
<br>
need some smart people to keep society running.
<br>
I've got a friend who works at a waste treatment
<br>
plant, and his job requires a college-level
<br>
science degree.  You have to understand things like
<br>
bacterial growth, trace chemicals, Ph levels, etc.
<br>
to do the job.  Other jobs at oil refineries,
<br>
power plants, etc. require technical knowledge,
<br>
and then you need people to teach these people 
<br>
those technical subjects.  Now try to stop all
<br>
these people from thinking.  It's just not going
<br>
to happen.
