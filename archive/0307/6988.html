<p>
There's a reason why the Whole Earth Review can't raise enough money to
<br>
paper-publish anymore: it's as dead financially as it is intellectually.
<br>
<p>No doubt WER thought that an issue focusing on the Singularity might bring
<br>
in a host of new readers. Unfortunately, its imbalanced presentation of the
<br>
Vingean Singularity idea is so poorly done that it is little more than a
<br>
joke. WER rounded up its usual suspects, such as Lanier and Sterling, to do
<br>
their usual hatchet job on trends they either don't like (Lanier) or they
<br>
don't understand (Sterling). Cory Doctorow, a once promising SF author, has
<br>
just embarrassed himself for life.
<br>
<p>It's too bad, really. WER used to be provocative, interesting and a whole
<br>
lot of fun. But that was in the good old days before it began its long, slow
<br>
decline.
<br>
<p>The slide of WER into irrelevance began more than 10 years ago. What was
<br>
once a vibrant and intellectually diverse clearinghouse for non-mainstream
<br>
ideas under founder Stewart Brand became a significantly less adventuresome,
<br>
more predictable, more politically-correct effort under the hands of a long
<br>
line of short-term editors, none of whom could make a go of it.
<br>
<p>I cancelled my subscription some time in the '90s after having been a loyal
<br>
subscriber since the '70s.
<br>
<p>Like many more-or-less intellectual magazines, WER never made enough money
<br>
through subscriptions or newsstand sales to pay its own way. Such journals
<br>
are wholly dependent on rich benefactors to keep publishing. Willing
<br>
benefactors became few and far between as their fortunes dwindled along with
<br>
Silicon Valley and the stock market. (BTW, the offices of WER are in Marin
<br>
County near a houseboat landing. Very funky and cool. I knew people who
<br>
worked there just for a cachet of being able to say that they had done so.)
<br>
WER tried taking advertising for the first time several years ago in order
<br>
to make up the difference. It didn't work.
<br>
<p>The Vingean Singularity, if it transpires in the form of a Yudkowskian
<br>
Friendly A.I., promises to be a white hole fountain of fabulous creativity
<br>
and an almost magical cornucopia of beneficence for humanity.
<br>
<p>The Singularity of WER is, apparently, the gravitational collapse of a once
<br>
great magazine into a black hole of intellectual and financial bankruptcy.
