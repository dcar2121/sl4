<em>&gt; You make a large leap here, from communities have people who do more

(osteniably 
<br>
<em>&gt; the 'leaders' of a community) to community building is simply a process of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leader-selection. I disagree, because there are many communities that have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear leader, yet remain effective and rewarding. 
</em><br>
<p>In fact, I am not referring to a single leader, whether it be by authority 
<br>
through title or assigned position as a manager, nor a king with a hierachy of 
<br>
subordinates. I am referring to the type of leader(s) that people choose to 
<br>
follow or listen to - some extreme examples of powerful leaders would be Ghandi 
<br>
and Hitler. Those effective communities that have no clear authoritative leader
<br>
work because the members are in fact leading as well as following. Upon further 
<br>
examination of a community, you might actually find that some people have the 
<br>
ability to lead more than others.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; is the leader of slashdot? CmdrTaco? He started it, but the frontpage stories 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are selected by a groupeffect, not by him, nor anyone else. Who is the leader 
</em><br>
of 
<br>
<em>&gt; Extropy? Max More is the headman, certainly, but he's few and far between on 
</em><br>
the 
<br>
<em>&gt; lists, whereas bigtime list posters are nowhere to be found at the events.
</em><br>
<p>They might have led the founding of these communities, but these online 
<br>
communities are now led by the members who get listened to the most, most 
<br>
likely the frequent posters. Offline, Max More seems to be (one of) the leaders.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Communities need dedicated members, and Shirky makes a point of the fact that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sense of 'real members' new members, and core members may need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishing. But no body wants online monarchies, except some men who would 
</em><br>
be 
<br>
<em>&gt; king. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Hopefully you've understood my explanation of the two types of leaders -
<br>
&nbsp;one leader is defined by authority with subordinates, the other type of leader 
<br>
by their ability to communicate with their peers.
<br>
<p>Of course, if you're setting out to build an online community, you probably 
<br>
need to take on both my described leadership roles, like Eliezer is doing with 
<br>
this SL4 list, or people who create MUD's. Slashdot and the Extropian 
<br>
communities is an example of where the founders are not the biggest leaders WRT 
<br>
their online access.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From an intra-corporation standpoint, Carmack from id Software is an example of 
</em><br>
a founder who wants to stay involved in the core of the business, leading with 
<br>
his coding skillz, not with his authority.
<br>
<p>So by my definition, who are the leaders of this SL4 online community? Those 
<br>
with the most posts so far, I would say. Speaking for myself, when Eliezer or 
<br>
Ben post, I read it. They are my SL4 leaders. There are others whose postings I 
<br>
respect too, but they're relatively post less frequently for me to consider 
<br>
them as SL4 leaders.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
