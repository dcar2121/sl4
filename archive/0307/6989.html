<p>Economics will have a big impact on the shape of the emerging 
<br>
singularity, just as it had a big impact on the development of the 
<br>
internet.
<br>
<p>An AGI which requires costly resources will be expected to earn value 
<br>
for its creators and, if it is independent, compete for resources in a 
<br>
regulated market just like the rest of us. Until technology advances 
<br>
enough where &quot;everything is free&quot;, an AGI must earn its keep, even if 
<br>
it has to use benefactors.
<br>
<p>The process of surviving and thriving also could give an AGI valuable 
<br>
experiences (just as it does for human beings and organizations).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do we avoid getting a generation of AGIs that will do whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earns the most money to expand their minds?  If Dubya or some Mafia 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boss or an arms manufacture or a drug company or....pay the highest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why wouldn't the young AGI go along with it?
</em><br>
<p>Making money in un-Friendly ways would attract all kinds of costly heat 
<br>
from the affected (or concerned) parties. While an AGI would ideally be 
<br>
intelligent enough to avoid the pitfalls of easy money, what about the 
<br>
&quot;bad apples&quot;?
<br>
<p>On a somewhat related subject, I have been flushing out the 
<br>
implications of a theoretical software agent called an Econophage that 
<br>
will certainly be constructed once web services become more widespread. 
<br>
This agent  would &quot;survive&quot; and &quot;proliferate&quot; on the web by gathering 
<br>
financial energy through various kinds of market trading. The 
<br>
Econophage would use surplus financial energy to support its various 
<br>
life-like activities: maintaining an ISP account, maintaining some sort 
<br>
of market trading account, analyzing market information, and, most 
<br>
costly of all, reproduction.
