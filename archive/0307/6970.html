<em>&gt;I need a new word: a word to denote a mind that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;halfway between an individual mind and a society of minds.
</em><br>
<p>Rather than immediately shoot off in search of neologisms and
<br>
social metaphors, I'd like to see people think concretely and
<br>
pragmatically about this first. The future is going to hold all sorts
<br>
of novel psycho-socio-computational hybrids. There will be a
<br>
nuanced vocabulary, partly derived from the technical jargon of
<br>
AI and neuroscience, for the description of these entities.
<br>
Ben's word designates a very broad class of possible beings.
<br>
<p>Of the words suggested so far, &quot;chorus&quot; and &quot;symposium&quot;
<br>
suggest to me particular subclasses. They're both social
<br>
metaphors, and they carry connotations of particular forms
<br>
of activity: harmonizing and intellectualizing, respectively.
<br>
They are more likely to be *types* of mind-society, rather
<br>
than being truly general terms.
<br>
<p>Then we have &quot;mindplex&quot;. I suppose it has a chance. It
<br>
reminds me of &quot;meme&quot;. In a final scientific theory of mind, is
<br>
there really going to be anything called a meme? &quot;Meme&quot;
<br>
has already been spread too thin; it denotes any sort of
<br>
repeated or replicated structure with meaning. And conversely,
<br>
it's not grounded in any of the specificities of real minds.
<br>
If we find, say, that William Calvin is right and that there are
<br>
widely replicated representations in the cortical columns,
<br>
I would be very surprised to see those representations ending
<br>
up with the name &quot;meme&quot;. More likely they'll end up with
<br>
an acronym like &quot;CCSVs&quot; (&quot;cortical-columnar state vectors&quot;).
<br>
Anyway, &quot;mindplex&quot; seems to me too science-fictional, too
<br>
much a groovy term from the dawn of the Age of Mind to be
<br>
what they'll use when the networking of minds is an everyday
<br>
affair. Then again, even &quot;electron&quot; probably sounded outlandish
<br>
when it was first coined. That's why I think &quot;mindplex&quot; does
<br>
have a chance.
<br>
<p>Then we have a few terms that really are from science fiction.
<br>
&quot;Medusa&quot;, &quot;coral&quot;, &quot;snowflake&quot; - a different sort of metaphor.
<br>
To me, these ones have *architectural* connotations (in
<br>
the sense of system architecture). Again, they sound like
<br>
types - a coral is a mind-society or mind-network built on a
<br>
particular *type* of networking.
<br>
<p>&quot;The Comprise&quot;, well, that's like &quot;the Internet&quot;, it's a name
<br>
for a particular collective, rather than being a taxonomic term.
