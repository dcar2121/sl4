While researching mindplexes, I found this page on Theodore Sturgeon
<br>
<p><a href="http://glinda.lrsm.upenn.edu/~weeks/sturgeon/williams.html">http://glinda.lrsm.upenn.edu/~weeks/sturgeon/williams.html</a>
<br>
<p>which contains the following excellent quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;The secret I am trying to tell here is the art of storytelling, at its
<br>
highest -- how it's done. It's like Houdini getting himself locked in a
<br>
trunk and thrown in the ocean. I don't think he knows beforehand how he's
<br>
going to get out of that trunk. Rather, he's putting himself in a situation
<br>
where he will be forced to focus every bit of his own strength and
<br>
concentration on the problem at hand -- and he knows that under those
<br>
circumstances, and only those circumstances, he has the capability to find a
<br>
way out. It's an act of faith.
<br>
<p>&quot;The solution is: open the trunk. That's obvious. And the way to arrive at
<br>
the solution is to lock yourself in the trunk. That's not obvious at all.
<br>
But it's beautiful.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am sure this dude is wrong about Houdini (who would have been dead far
<br>
younger if this guy's theory were correct), but he's right about
<br>
storytelling!!
<br>
<p>And, veering back toward the SL4 domain, this seems like a rather nice
<br>
metaphor for the pickle the human race has gotten itself into with its
<br>
penchant for much technology and little wisdom....  In the metaphor, I guess
<br>
some of us on this list represent the portions of Houdini's brain who
<br>
actually realize that we are locked in the trunk ;)
<br>
<p>Yeah, yeah, metaphors are easily overstretched.  That's what makes them
<br>
poetic, I suppose ;-)
