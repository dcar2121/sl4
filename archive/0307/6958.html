</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a really important document for anyone interested in designing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; online communities.
</em><br>
<p><p>This thread is rather off-topic, possibly belonging in the &quot;meta&quot; category.
<br>
<p>We can abstract the concept of designing online communities to simply designing 
<br>
a community. I think it is a fallacy that any sort of community is self-
<br>
organizing with every member contributing and extracting an equal amount of 
<br>
experience. Communities have leaders that the other people are motivated to be 
<br>
led by in one way or another. There are different strategies for leadership, 
<br>
and even more books written about them.
<br>
<p>Most people who have studied or read up on leadership in business and politics 
<br>
probably have learnt one strategy from one authority, and failed. To those 
<br>
people and the people who have not studied leadership, there is a cynicism 
<br>
about whether any author can come up with a strategy for leadership. But I do 
<br>
believe there is a way, and that leadership strategy can be used by anyone to 
<br>
build a community, online or not.
<br>
<p>At this moment, I'm listening to Stephen Covey's &quot;Beyond the 7 Habits&quot;. He has 
<br>
written a slew of books under the &quot;7 Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; 
<br>
branding, and I would recommend reading one to anyone, especially if you're a 
<br>
leader, manager, or even a cynic.

<br>
<p>Remember, Franklin-Covey is much more than a business that makes time planners.
<br>
<p>In summary, if you want to build an (online) community, become an (online) 
<br>
leader. IMHO, Eliezer gets a 8/10 ranking from me so far :-)
<br>
<p>cheers,
