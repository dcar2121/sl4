Thanks, Mez, we are aware of some of those past efforts. I agree that those
<br>
are samples of  important work we must consider as a guidance in our
<br>
efforts, as you will not doubt agree with me that those projects show us
<br>
what NOT to do, but do not show what CAN'T be done. 
<br>
<p>Mass simulation in a computer constrained environment is a challenging task,
<br>
and we do believe this is a classical computer science challenge, not only a
<br>
neurology mystery. We think that this type of challenge is not so different
<br>
from the task before anyone trying to take on Google or SAP.
<br>
<p>What type of computer infrastructure do you need to integrate the supply
<br>
chain, product and order fulfilment, customer support, payment orders and
<br>
banking needs of a world wide corporation?
<br>
How many ops does it take to look for a given phrase in a pool of 3,3
<br>
billion web pages, rank the results, re-rank the winners, and orderly
<br>
display those for thousands of concurrent users?
<br>
<p>Well, certainly not us many as a candid observer would estimate. The
<br>
difference between theoretical computation taking place in a complex query,
<br>
and the real computer power needs of Google, is what makes possible its
<br>
astonishing performance, and the main reason why, so far, Microsoft has been
<br>
unable to circumvent their patents and produce the competing search engine
<br>
they promised 2 years ago.
<br>
<p>Our job is to take over that challenge, and we have some modest reasons to
<br>
believe that we may succeed, reasons good enough to dedicate my resources,
<br>
my employees, and my full, an distracted attention to that task from now on.
<br>
<p>But over all, we very much welcome the help, comments and frank dialog with
<br>
like minded individuals like you, what is why we are in the Valley in the
<br>
first place!
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
Marcos Guillen
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Marcos, as I said in email to you and on this list, I like your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;architecture and the fact that it allows you to easily update the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simulation techniques you use.  I'm very pleased to see someone taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a project of this sort, and in particular doing so without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constraints of a short-term project.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I also agree with you that we don't know yet exactly what level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;granularity will be required to simulate the brain.  My only complaint
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that we can be fairly certain that the required level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;granularity is quite a bit beyond what you currently estimate.  How do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we know this?  Because other groups have spent years working on neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;simulations and have found that, without getting down to well below
</em><br>
<em>&gt;single-neuron resolution, their simulations produce results that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wildly different from what we see in actual brains*.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So again, I congratulate you on the audacity of trying to pull off
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this project.  Your approach on the software side seems sound.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would only suggest that you reconsider your estimates of how far away
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you are from being able to accurately simulate a real human brain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mez
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;* - See for example:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1) The NEURON Neural Simulation Environment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2) The book _Computational Neuroscience: Realistic Modeling for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Experimentalists_, CRC Press (2000)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
