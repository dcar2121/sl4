The Moral Sense Test
<br>
<p><a href="http://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/">http://moral.wjh.harvard.edu/</a>
<br>
<p>Sponsored by the Primate Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Harvard
<br>
<p>The Moral Sense Test is a Web-based study into the nature of moral
<br>
intuitions. How do humans, throughout the world, decide what is right and
<br>
wrong? To answer this question, we have designed a series of moral dilemmas
<br>
designed to probe the psychological mechanisms underlying our ethical
<br>
judgments. By putting these questions on the Web, we hope to gain insight
<br>
into the similarities and differences between the moral intuitions of people
<br>
of different ages, from different cultures, with different educational
<br>
backgrounds and religious beliefs, involved in different occupations and
<br>
exposed to very different circumstances. Participation in the study is easy,
<br>
quick and completely confidential.
<br>
<p>* * * *
<br>
<p>Nothing captures human attention more than a moral dilemma. Whether we are
<br>
soap opera fanatics or not, we can't help sticking our noses in other people
<br>
's affairs, pronouncing our views on right and wrong, permissible and
<br>
impermissible, justified or not. For hundreds of years, scholars have argued
<br>
that our moral judgments arise from rational, conscious, voluntary,
<br>
reflective deliberations about what ought to be. This perspective has
<br>
generated the further belief that our moral psychology is a slowly
<br>
developing capacity, founded entirely on experience and education, and
<br>
subject to considerable variation across cultures. With the exception of a
<br>
few trivial examples, one culture's right is another's wrong. We believe
<br>
this hyper rational, culturally-specific view is no longer tenable. The MST
<br>
has been designed to show why and offer an alternative. Most of our moral
<br>
intuitions are unconscious, involuntary, and universal, developing in each
<br>
child despite formal education. When humans, from the hunter-gathers of the
<br>
Rift Valley to the billionaire dot-com-ers of the Silicon Valley generate
<br>
moral intuitions they are like reflexes, something that happens to us
<br>
without our being aware of how or even why. We call this capacity our moral
<br>
faculty. Our aim is to use data from the MST, as well as other experiments,
<br>
to explain what it is, how it evolved, and how it develops in our species,
<br>
creating individuals with moral responsibilities and concerns about human
<br>
welfare. The MST has been designed for all humans who are curious about that
<br>
puzzling little word &quot;ought&quot; - about the principles that make one action
<br>
right and another wrong, and why we feel elated about the former and guilty
<br>
about the latter.
<br>
<p>As in every modernly held view, there are significant historical
<br>
antecedents. The origins of our own perspective date back at least 300 years
<br>
to the philosopher David Hume and more recently, to the political
<br>
philosopher John Rawls. But unlike these prescient thinkers, we can now
<br>
validate the intuitions with significant scientific evidence. Over the past
<br>
twenty years, there has been growing evidence for a universally shared moral
<br>
faculty based on findings in evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology,
<br>
anthropology, economics, linguistics, and neurobiology. This evidence has
<br>
created a powerful movement directed at the core aspects of human nature. It
<br>
is a movement that has the power to reshape our lives by uncovering the deep
<br>
structure of our moral intuitions and showing how they can either support or
<br>
conflict with our conscious, often legally supported decisions.
