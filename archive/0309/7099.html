<p><em>&gt; Want to bring to your attention the point of view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that may be more practical and productive.
</em><br>
<p>I conjecture that in daily life all our theorizing results in very little effective
<br>
behavioral differences anyway.  But!   Indeed what you have to say could
<br>
impact people's thinking about the emergence and design of AI, I gather.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is a sight on [view of] moral categories as on a game.
</em><br>
<p>This really, really brings memes and results arising from game theory
<br>
into play.  Have you read any of the literature about the theory of games and
<br>
its relation to morals?  E.g.,  Harsanyi (who I have not read) and Binmore
<br>
&quot;Playing Fair&quot; which I have---there is evidently a huge literature on the subject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That [it] is accepted that sensations [of] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fan on a football match [are] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentially similar to sensations of the juryman.
</em><br>
<p>It is understood that the responsible juryman attempts to add more into
<br>
his verdict than merely sentiments in favor of the person he
<br>
sympathizes with.  Whether or not on logical grounds the law has
<br>
been broken is supposed to be a large part of his thinking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not under the form but under the contents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that moral values have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent value which does not give in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the rational analysis.
</em><br>
<p>I would say yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same can be told about game.
</em><br>
<p>I would say no.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But also we have cautions.  The moral category is not reduced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the game.
</em><br>
<p>Correct, IMO
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This caution is based on the lowest level on an instinct to survive.
</em><br>
<p>And (theory of games) to propagate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We may consider 10 precepts as rules of the game. But we have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities to change them.
</em><br>
<p>There are other precepts besides the ten commandments that I submit
<br>
do change some people's behavior.
<br>
<p>Isn't it commonly accepted that our memes can change our behavior?
<br>
That parents, for example, can drill into you things like &quot;honesty is the best
<br>
policy&quot;, or &quot;just say no to drugs&quot;, and it *can* affect behavior?  Is it not
<br>
also true that for some religious people, their acceptance of Jesus Christ
<br>
into their hearts really does improve their ability to reciprocate with others
<br>
and even to be apparently very altruistic to others?   I am asking because
<br>
all this is remains most unsettled with me!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; P.S. Please do not think that above given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meditation for final belief of the author.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question of morals - a thing very thin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Critically investigating it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is very hard to not get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a trap of denying of morals.
</em><br>
<p>I enthusiastically agree!  Morals can *not* be reduced to game theory so
<br>
far as I know (and have believed since 1995 after having read &quot;The Origins
<br>
of Virtue&quot; by Matt Ridley).  And yet, whether we ought to call a certain 
<br>
subject of &quot;altruistic&quot; behavior that arises in some people at some times
<br>
&quot;genuine altruism&quot;  is something I am actively pursuing.  
<br>
<p>I do appreciate that perhaps you mean more along the lines of &quot;morality&quot; as
<br>
pursuit of an reasoning set of axioms or principles on which to logically
<br>
base moral behavior.   The latter does not interest me at this time.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your post,
<br>
Lee Corbin
