<em>&gt; The efficacy is independent of the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data since it codes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns in the abstract.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Some more questions, if you can stand them: Since it
<br>
codes patterns in abstract have you tested it against
<br>
&quot;junk&quot; material to ensure a control to compare
<br>
against?
<br>
<p>And would it be worth it to run this code upon two
<br>
types of related datasets, such as a code tree and the
<br>
corresponding documentation? Or perhaps, even upon
<br>
itself, or would that meaningless?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It won't be released in a developmental stage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless.  The code base is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite small and clean but also very intricate; it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be very difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hack...
</em><br>
<p>Not to offend, but anything can be hacked and there's
<br>
always someone smarter than you, so don't let that
<br>
hold you back. If you had the code tied up in some
<br>
kind hedge investment and legalities prevented you,
<br>
than sure, don't release it.
<br>
<p>I just want to get on my soap box here very quickly
<br>
before I get sniped off. I'll make this short: 
<br>
<p>If anyone approaches AGI, but it is funded via some
<br>
kind of commercialization scheme, mankind will not see
<br>
Singularity from it. It's a catch-22 though cause you
<br>
want to make money, but would like to move things
<br>
along towards the Singularity. You have to look at who
<br>
legally controls the code and decide which is more
<br>
important; money or Man.
<br>
<p>Well it sounds like you have something really swell.
<br>
I'll be looking out for your company, when you figure
<br>
out a name. 
<br>
<p>cheers
