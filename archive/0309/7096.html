<br>
<p>EMERGING COMMUNITY ASKS BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT ACCELERATING CHANGE
<br>
<p>PALO ALTO, CA (September 3, 2003) - The world's first multidisciplinary
<br>
forum to explore business and society's accelerating rate of change, the
<br>
Accelerating Change Conference (ACC2003), occurs September 12-14, 2003,
<br>
at Stanford University's Tresidder Union.  Twenty-four prominent thinkers
<br>
will present topics with profound implications about the course of our
<br>
lives, and humanity's near- and long-term future.
<br>
<p>Several presenters will focus on the domains of nanotechnology and
<br>
artificial intelligence - two rapidly growing technologies expected to be
<br>
critically important in the twenty-first century.
<br>
<p>K. Eric Drexler, Chair of Foresight Institute and author of Engines of
<br>
Creation, will clarify the long-term goals of nanotechnology (developing
<br>
nanofactories that precisely control matter at the atomic level), and the
<br>
focused research likely to safely and swiftly achieve these goals.
<br>
<p>Matthew Lennig, Senior VP of Engineering at Nuance Inc., will review the
<br>
history of linguistic interfaces (systems that support communication
<br>
between humans and machines based on spoken or written human language),
<br>
present a vision for the future, and discuss the challenges that lie between
<br>
the present state of technology and the future linguistic user interface.
<br>
<p>Christine Peterson, President of Foresight Institute, will explore the
<br>
benefits and risks of nanotechnology, the importance of avoiding intentional
<br>
abuse, the need for improved education about this technology and what policy
<br>
strategies will work, the Foresight Institute's preferred strategy of open,
<br>
cooperative international development, and how individuals can help ensure
<br>
the safe progression toward the next manufacturing revolution.
<br>
<p>Ben Goertzel, CEO of Biomind, will examine the current state of artificial
<br>
general intelligence (AGI) theory and technology, and why over the next few
<br>
decades, powered by ongoing advances in computing hardware, AGI is poised
<br>
to play a leading role in the development of twenty-first century
<br>
technology, with emphasis on the power of AGI to enhance work in biotech,
<br>
nanotech, fundamental physics, and distributed cognition. Wearing his
<br>
futurist hat, Goertzel will propose that the infusion of AGI through various
<br>
areas of advanced technology may serve as the transition phase to a
<br>
technological singularity (the development of human-surpassing
<br>
intelligence), driven and dominated by sophisticated AGI systems.
<br>
<p>John Smart, President of the Institute for Accelerating Change (IAC), the
<br>
event's organizer, said &quot;Everybody has noticed it, but no community talks
<br>
openly and systematically about accelerating change. We're bringing together
<br>
leaders from multiple disciplines on this neglected and future-critical
<br>
subject. We don't just focus on nanotech, AI, and the continuation of
<br>
Moore's Law - we explore broader topics, such as 'Is technology becoming a
<br>
learning system?' 'Which technologies are self-catalyzing?' 'Is there a
<br>
historical trend toward increasing interdependence, intelligence, and
<br>
immunity in complex systems, such as human societies?' 'How do we guide
<br>
technology's development toward effectively solving social problems?'&quot;
<br>
<p>Smart continued, &quot;We are still early in asking the big questions about the
<br>
accelerating future, and in finding ways to wisely guide acceleration in our
<br>
modern lives. But the more we give ourselves permission to consider these
<br>
issues, the better equipped we will be to create our daily personal and
<br>
collective futures, consistent with unavoidable accelerating trends.&quot;
<br>
<p>To that end, the event's Collective Intelligence dinner will give all
<br>
participants a chance to explore their choice of 20-30 &quot;Challenge Questions&quot;
<br>
about the conference's themes, such as &quot;What is the significance of global
<br>
IT services to small businesses?&quot; and &quot;What classes of technologies can
<br>
individuals and enterprises use to increase their productivity in the next
<br>
five years?&quot; Each table will seat eight attendees with one question per
<br>
table. After the dinner, self-selected speakers will give a summary report
<br>
of their table's response to their particular question.
<br>
<p>Tyler Emerson, IAC Vice President, said &quot;The dinner blends small-group
<br>
brainstorming with large-group presentation to gain personalized
<br>
perspectives on a range of valuable questions. To be honest, every event
<br>
should have such a dinner. It provides an efficient way to explore the
<br>
knowledge of our distinguished participants, both speakers and attendees,
<br>
and to improve the quality of their networking and participation.&quot;
<br>
<p>Christine Peterson, President of Foresight Institute, noted that &quot;The first
<br>
meeting on an exciting topic like this is always a major event, attracting a
<br>
'Who's Who' of forward-looking thinkers. You'll meet the people who see
<br>
what's coming, know how to grapple with it, and are taking action to steer
<br>
and benefit from the tsunami of change we're all riding.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mark Finnern, an event speaker, added &quot;Most events covering the future look
<br>
two years ahead. What ACC2003 participants will do is take a step back, open
<br>
their eyes and look five to 30 years into the future. If you bring bright
<br>
minds together, some of them experts in their fields, coming from different
<br>
walks of life with different viewpoints, magical things happen.&quot;
