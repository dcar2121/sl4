</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; what is happening, but it's the explanation that seems most likely - it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems as if the last fifteen seconds of mental imagery are still &quot;in my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loop&quot; when I wake up, so I remember them too, just as if they were lucid. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From my psychology training many years ago...
</em><br>
There are two types of memories.  Short-term or temporary memories which are
<br>
never stored for long-term use, and long-term memory.  Short-term memory is
<br>
used when you are driving a car and pass someone.  You know they are there,
<br>
you pay attention to them, and safely pass them.  A minute later, you may
<br>
not remember passing them.  If there was nothing memorable about them, you
<br>
won't note it for long term storage.  The brain does not store every single
<br>
experience with photographic precision for all time.  Instead, it
<br>
accumulates important items, and condenses the rest.  Even though you may
<br>
remember driving on a trip, you won't be able to recall every single mile
<br>
and describe what you observed on each.
<br>
<p>Dreams are unimportant to most of us.  You have them all the time, but don't
<br>
note them.  Everybody can remember their dreams upon immediately waking, but
<br>
forgets them within minutes of waking up.  The only thing that makes them
<br>
memorable is if you think about them.  If you wake up suddenly, you recall
<br>
your dream and think about it to yourself.  For example, when your cellphone
<br>
wakes you up, you think to yourself that you were just sitting in a class
<br>
and suddenly were jolted awake somewhere else to find that the class was
<br>
just a dream.  That is a pretty dramatic thought, and you will probably
<br>
remember it.  If you don't think about the entire dream, you will probably
<br>
only remember the last few seconds of your dream later.  If you keep a dream
<br>
diary, or sequentially try to recall your dreams immediately upon waking,
<br>
you will be able to remember them later.  I have done a lot of experimenting
<br>
with lucid dreams (where you know you are dreaming) and have had to figure
<br>
out how to remember my experiments later.  If I don't recount the dream, I
<br>
forget it.  Even if I remember that I had a dream, I can't recall the
<br>
details.  If I recount the dream to myself, I can remember it later.  I have
<br>
tested this theory by selectively recounting one dream to myself but not
<br>
others.  Later, I can only recall the dream I chose and not the others.  I
<br>
have even selected items to remember and items to forget.  For example, I
<br>
had a dream about teaching a class.  I deliberately repeated over and over
<br>
to myself the statement &quot;I was teaching a class.&quot;  I deliberately wanted to
<br>
focus on that item only and nothing else.  Sure enough, later I could
<br>
remember teaching, but not what the subject was.  I have also done the same
<br>
thing where I have had dreams about three objects, and tried to recall as
<br>
much detail about two of them trying to ignore the other one.  Sure enough,
<br>
the ones I recalled to myself were remembered later, but the one I did not
<br>
focus on quickly faded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   So the memory I actually have is of waking up, and then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; five seconds or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifteen seconds *later*, the phone rings.  With an experience 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that, 
</em><br>
<p>Dreams seems to be able to fit a lot of action in a small amount of time.  I
<br>
have had long detailed dream sequences in the space of a few minutes.  I
<br>
have nodded off for a few seconds and had a dream when other people insisted
<br>
I couldn't have been asleep long enough.  I have even had a couple of rare
<br>
dreams that seemed to span months (with different &quot;scenes&quot; at different
<br>
points in time).  This phenomenon also explains why people who awaken during
<br>
a few seconds of sleep-paralysis often dream about being paralyzed unable to
<br>
move for minutes at a time.  This has been observed in the laboratory where
<br>
external stimuli is known to have been short while dreamers report longer
<br>
experiences.
<br>
<p>My explanation is that you actually heard the phone or alarm.  Your brain
<br>
knows what it is and works it into your dream.  During the seconds when you
<br>
wake up, you aren't conscious of the noise as you transition between dream
<br>
sensory input and outside (real-life) sensory input.  The dream sounds fades
<br>
and it seems like a longer period of time before you realize that you are
<br>
hearing the external noise.
