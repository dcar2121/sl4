Hi,
<br>
<p>I just saw a talk by one of the leaders of this enterprise, at the
<br>
Accelerating Change 2003 conference.
<br>
<p>It's an interesting effort, but they seem to have no particular insight into
<br>
the operation of the human brain and how it may give rise to intelligent
<br>
behavior.  Their focus so far has been on the mechanics of building up the
<br>
distributed neural-net simulation.  They have no neuroscientists involved
<br>
with the project, just programmers.
<br>
<p>It seems very likely that their initial efforts will not lead to anything
<br>
very interesting.  But, afterwards, if they ally themselves with some folks
<br>
with more insight into the neuroscience side of brain modeling, they  might
<br>
come up with something interesting/useful, who knows.

<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;CCortex Will Rank among the World's Fastest Computers
<br>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 12, 2003--Artificial
<br>
Development, Inc. today announced that it has completed assembly of
<br>
the first functional portion of a prototype of CCortex(TM), a 20-
<br>
billion neuron emulation of the human cortex, which it will use to
<br>
build a next-generation artificial intelligence system. Artificial
<br>
Development will initiate testing of CCortex in October.
<br>
The cluster being assembled at AD.com Data Center is a high-
<br>
performance, parallel supercomputer, composed of 500 nodes and one
<br>
thousand processors, 1.5 terabytes of RAM, and 80 terabytes of
<br>
storage.
<br>
<p>The low-cost software/hardware system runs on Linux, Intel and AMD
<br>
processors. When all sections are assembled, CCortex is expected to
<br>
reach a theoretical peak performance of 4,800 Gflops, making it one
<br>
of the top 20 fastest computers in the world. The cluster will be
<br>
used as a test bed for beta versions of CCortex.
<br>
<p>CCortex is a massive spiking neuron network emulation and will mimic
<br>
the human cortex, the outer layer of gray matter at the cerebral
<br>
hemispheres, largely responsible for higher brain functions. The
<br>
emulation covers up to 20 billion layered neurons and 2 trillion 8-
<br>
bit connections.
<br>
<p>&quot;Our new neural network is several orders of magnitude larger than
<br>
any of today's research efforts,&quot; said Marcos Guillen, Artificial
<br>
Development CEO.
<br>
<p>How CCortex Works: A Spike-Friendly Neural Network
<br>
<p>Most neural network models to date have been based on the Hebbian
<br>
network, a simplified version of the real neural networks based
<br>
exclusively on connectivity properties between neurons.
<br>
<p>CCortex adds to classical Hebbian connections a time-sensitive,
<br>
analog representation of the shape of &quot;spikes,&quot; the pulsing patterns
<br>
that enable neuron populations to communicate with each other. This
<br>
allows CCortex to tune vast populations of neurons and the
<br>
information they hold to complex spiking patterns, adding a much
<br>
higher level of complexity to a highly realistic simulation.
<br>
<p>The CCortex software emulation applies its Spiking Neuron Software
<br>
Engine to a database that has a representation of the layered
<br>
distribution of neural nets and detailed interconnections in the
<br>
brain. The data closely emulates specialized regions of the human
<br>
cortex, corpus callosum, anterior commissure, amygdale and
<br>
hippocampus.
<br>
<p>The emulation aims to actualize the estate of each neuron and its
<br>
connections several times per second, maintaining a myriad of
<br>
competing spiking patterns, while providing feedback and limited
<br>
interaction with simplified versions of other nervous and sensory
<br>
systems.
<br>
<p>About Artificial Development
<br>
<p>Mountain View, Calif.-based Artificial Development was founded by
<br>
Founder, President and CEO Marcos Guillen in July 2003. A privately
<br>
held company, Artificial Development is comprised of an
<br>
international, multidisciplinary team of computer programmers,
<br>
mathematicians, and computer infrastructure professionals who are
<br>
working to introduce the world's first true AI. The company's
<br>
technology, CCortex(TM) is a complete emulation of the human cortex
<br>
and peripheral systems. Artificial Development plans to deliver a
<br>
wide range of commercial products based on CCortex(TM) to enhance
<br>
business relationships globally. For more information, please visit
