<em>&gt; There is also the phenomenon of lucid dreaming where one is

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I am one of those rare people who have lucid dreams regularly.  A lucid
<br>
dream is when you recognize that you are asleep while you dream.  Once you
<br>
realize that you are dreaming, you can try to change the items in your
<br>
dream.
<br>
<p>I developed this ability because my parents allowed me to watch horror films
<br>
at a very young age.  I would regularly have nightmares about the movies
<br>
after I had seen them.  After seeing so many reruns and having so many
<br>
recurring nightmares, I began to recognize the monsters.  Specifically, I
<br>
would recognize which monster came from which movie.  I would remember which
<br>
actors were in the movie, or which remake of the movie my particular monster
<br>
was emulating.  I knew the monsters were fictional and therefore I must be
<br>
dreaming.
<br>
<p>After a while, I began to recognize other dreams as well.  Dreams just
<br>
seemed different than waking life.  I would just suddenly realize, oh I am
<br>
asleep and dreaming this.  Even though it looks real to me, it is a dream.
<br>
Usually, people wake up as soon as they realize that they are dreaming.  I
<br>
think their mental focus goes away from the dream image and they start
<br>
trying to pay attention to physical sensations of lying in bed, or they try
<br>
to open their eyes to see where they are.  It is difficult to stay relaxed
<br>
and asleep.
<br>
<p>While one is asleep and dreaming, it is possible to change the dream.
<br>
Visualizations can seem to become real.  The subconscious dream process
<br>
creates and maintains the image with no conscious effort on the part of the
<br>
dreamer.  If the dreamer writes a large mathematical equation on paper in a
<br>
dream, it is easier to see it and work out the problem longhand than trying
<br>
to do it in your head.  While the conscious mind can't keep all the numbers
<br>
straight, the dream visualization can.  I have performed large mathematical
<br>
equations and memorized the results to demonstrate that I could do real math
<br>
&quot;on paper&quot; in a dream.  I have also developed plans and checklists while
<br>
asleep and woken up with memories of actual accomplishments that I could use
<br>
in real life.  It really works like a Star Trek holodeck within one's own
<br>
mind.  I expect future computer/human interfaces to be able to make use of
<br>
this ability of the human mind to run simulations.
