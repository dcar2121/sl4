</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would volitionism deal with this problem?
</em><br>
<p>Classical economists tend to construct U(x) by looking at a person's 
<br>
actual choices, assuming their probability function P obeys Bayesian 
<br>
rules, and assuming that their choices obey the expected utility rule. 
<br>
Cognitive psychologists know darn well that people don't use Bayesian 
<br>
reasoning on probabilities and that their choices aren't consistent under 
<br>
expected utility, so they try to figure out the probabilities actually 
<br>
assign, and the forces that actually influence their choices.
<br>
<p>As humans, we simply don't *have* a U(x) in the sense of the expected 
<br>
utility rule - we are not that consistent.  We do, however, have a 
<br>
decision system that relates utilities to outcomes, outcomes to 
<br>
probabilities, probabilities to actions, and uses all that information to 
<br>
assign desirabilities to actions.  We just don't do it consistently.
<br>
<p>Some analyses of utility assume that humans are black boxes and that we 
<br>
are allowed only to look at their actions, and that we are supposed to 
<br>
deduce a utility function and probability assignment from these actions 
<br>
and the (false) assumption that people are perfectly structured according 
<br>
to Bayesian probability and expected utility.  If so, there would be an 
<br>
infinite set of U', P' that could generate those choices, but that might 
<br>
not generate any ambiguity in the set of possible *volitional* orderings 
<br>
over the same choices.  For example, if you multiply all utilities by a 
<br>
non-negative constant, you get the same preference orderings.  You also 
<br>
get the same volitional orderings.  So the apparently infinite range of 
<br>
U(x) merely reflects the fact that utility is a measure rather than a 
<br>
function.  (That is, the &quot;utility&quot; in &quot;expected utility&quot;, which is a 
<br>
mathematical construct, is a measure rather than a function; this is not 
<br>
intended as an assertion about human cognition.)
<br>
<p>I haven't looked into the result you refer to, Wei Dai, but my initial 
<br>
impression is that it assumes infinite degrees of freedom in both U(x) and 
<br>
P(x).  Leaving aside the former, the latter, at least, is usually assumed 
<br>
to normatively obey Bayesian probabilities, and cognitively it obeys 
<br>
certain loose non-Bayesian rules.  We are surprised when we see that under 
<br>
certain circumstances people assign subjective likelihoods P(A&amp;B) &gt; P(A), 
<br>
but having discovered this, we can then predict that most people will do 
<br>
it most of the time under those conditions.  So there are not infinite 
<br>
degrees of freedom in P(x), either normatively or cognitively, and if you 
<br>
use this constraint to construct U(x) you will not find infinite relevant 
<br>
degrees of freedom in U(x) either.  Of course I am only reasoning 
<br>
intuitively here, and I may have gotten the math wrong.
<br>
<p>But, mostly my reply is that I'm not using the economist assumption that 
<br>
we have to construct U(x) and P(x) by looking exclusively at people's 
<br>
choices.  From a volitionist standpoint, what I would like to do is open 
<br>
up people's heads and look at their mind-state, figure out what systems 
<br>
are working, what they contain, what actual system is producing the 
<br>
choices, and then, having this functional decomposition, ask which parts 
<br>
have U(x) nature and which parts have P(x) nature, bearing in mind that 
<br>
they will overlap.  Existing cognitive psychology actually goes quite a 
<br>
ways toward doing this.
<br>
<p>Or to put it another way... suppose I show someone a spinner wheel A that 
<br>
is one-tenth red, and another spinner wheel B that is nine-tenths red.  I 
<br>
ask:  &quot;Would you rather have a chocolate ice cream cone given that A shows 
<br>
red, or a vanilla ice cream cone given that B shows red?&quot;  Technically we 
<br>
should also show an empty spinner C, in case the person is on a diet and 
<br>
doesn't want an ice cream cone at all.  Suppose the person waves aside our 
<br>
offer to opt out of the experiment.
<br>
<p>If the person then says they would rather have a chocolate ice cream cone 
<br>
on A, rather than a vanilla ice cream cone on B, it *could* be that they 
<br>
like vanilla more than chocolate, but that they think that B is extremely 
<br>
unlikely to come up red for some odd reason, or that they think A is 
<br>
unusually likely to come up red for some odd reason.  But most people, 
<br>
modeling what is actually likely to be going on inside the chooser's head 
<br>
- inferentially, rather than deductively - would make the pragmatic guess 
<br>
that the person prefers chocolate to vanilla.
<br>
<p>And if we opened up the person's mind-state and looked inside to see what 
<br>
kind of information-processing was going on, we would find some subjective 
<br>
likelihood for A and B was being generated, some expected liking was being 
<br>
generated for vanilla and chocolate, and that these two cognitive datums 
<br>
interacted to generate desirabilities for the actions and finally a choice.
