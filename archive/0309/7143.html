Hi Marcos,
<br>
<p>Sorry if my comments seemed too skeptical and not understanding enough of
<br>
the nature of your enterprise.  I get that way sometimes, especially when my
<br>
obsession with AI leads me to cut my sleeping hours too short ;-)
<br>
<p>I certainly agree that having a large-scale distributed platform for neural
<br>
computing will be a very good thing.  And I'm glad you agree that, to get
<br>
real value out of this network for AI (or for theoretical neuroscience, for
<br>
that matter), a lot of hard thinking will need to be done regarding the
<br>
specific design of the neural network being run on this exciting new
<br>
platform.
<br>
<p>I agree that neuroscience, in itself, does not currently provide enough
<br>
guidance to create a highly intelligent, large-scale neural net.  What it
<br>
provides is general guidance, and the rest of the architecture of your NN
<br>
will have to be figured out through intuitive combination of information
<br>
from neuroscience, psychology, computer science, with a healthy dose of pure
<br>
guesswork.
<br>
<p>If you ever feel interested in doing some collaborative thinking on how to
<br>
structure your mega neural network in a useful way, I'm sure that both Peter
<br>
Voss and I would be very willing to toss around some ideas together with
<br>
your team.  While we don't have hardware infrastructures on the scale of
<br>
yours, we've been thinking about how to structure quasi-neural computing
<br>
systems for quite some time (although my own AI design Novamente, isn't
<br>
really all that quasi-neural anymore, it did start out that way).
<br>
<p>-- Ben G

<em>&gt; &gt;I saw the same talk as Ben, and his post pretty much sums it up. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;current model of the brain this group has is rather simplistic, to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the least. On the other hand, the architecture of their system seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;to allow fairly rapid additions to the model.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; I just saw a talk by one of the leaders of this enterprise,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; at the Accelerating Change 2003 conference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It's an interesting effort, but they seem to have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; particular insight into the operation of the human brain ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yea, I agree. At Artificial Development, we have no particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insight into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the operation of the human brain, and we are rather simplistic folks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Further more, we are not that smart, either. Nothing to see here, keep on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, I would like to thank you both, Ramez and Ben, for attending our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presentation, it was a pleasure talking for such a qualified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audience. It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great to be able to exchange ideas with people like you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are computer engineers, no neurologist, and we are aware that our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediate goals may not seem that interesting from a theorist perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our goal is to build a system capable of algorithmically operating over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billions of neuron and trillions of connections, in real time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sounds fun to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you? Well, for us it is, and it's quit a challenge: CCortex data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matrix is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of times bigger than Google.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem to be concern with what you perceive as a 'simplistic'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what specific operations do we perform, and what parameters we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering. Well, so we do. We don't think that there is enough knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out there to define the precise operations we must necessarily perform to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correctly update our artificial brain. We do not have any special,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'particular insight' into the human brain, no mystic, sudden revelation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In fact, the only thing we are really sure about is that neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we, neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other competing groups know enough at this point; and those are precisely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the foundations of our project: A versatile, flexible, powerful, easy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adapt, pure software implementations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By design, we can modify the central algorithm governing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; update over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weekend, to accommodate different theories. We keep individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for each neuron to accommodate a number of fields of updatable data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pertaining to the neuron body,  plus vector, positioning and weigh data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fields for and average 1,000 connections per neuron. What fields? Those we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deem necessary in each run. What operations? Any operation we may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need. Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation has low computing requirements, while the rest are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximated or pre-calculated and stored on a database. After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, after a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few cycles, the bulk of the possible operations to perform in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been already calculated, and is susceptible of being sampled,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stored and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reused with minimum error margins.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Finally, keep in mind that, also by design, we are a privately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held company,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we are not aiming for the sort term. We do not depend of outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; financing, and we do not need to spend that much time with things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customers, academic peer approval, or even (mostly nonexistent)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And yes, we are here to stay, but don't expect our 1 week old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cluster to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ready for prime time any time soon: this are just the first steps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term project, and it's no time yet for Eliezer to start freaking out :-)
