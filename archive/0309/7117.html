</em><br>
<p>James, can you briefly put down the actual math of the theoretical limit 
<br>
you're talking about?
<br>
<p>One of the things us AGI researchers need to worry about is that the 
<br>
conceptual distance between ourselves and others is much greater than we 
<br>
expect, even when we are trying to be aware of this problem and take it 
<br>
into account.  When I got a closer, more technical look at Novamente it 
<br>
was almost nothing like I'd imagined it from Ben Goertzel's other 
<br>
descriptions - if I'd written a summary of what I thought was going on in 
<br>
Novamente, I doubt that Ben Goertzel would have been able to recognize any 
<br>
element of it as his own.  Similarly, when Ben Goertzel is talking about 
<br>
&quot;Levels of Organization in General Intelligence&quot; or Friendliness, I have 
<br>
yet to see anything that I would recognize as similar to my own ideas if 
<br>
it were not being attributed to &quot;Eliezer Yudkowsky&quot;.  It is just very hard 
<br>
for us AGIfolk to constrain other AGIfolk to construct mental imagery that 
<br>
is anything like what is in our own heads.  For example, the term &quot;mental 
<br>
imagery&quot; has a meaning to me that is probably totally unlike what it has 
<br>
to Ben Goertzel.
<br>
<p>I don't have any idea of what's going on in your AI, except that it has 
<br>
something to do with Solomonoff induction.  (My internal model 
<br>
distribution of possible AIs is inadequately constrained by your 
<br>
environmental inputs so far.)  I visualize you generating short programs 
<br>
and investigating the match of their predicted probability distributions 
<br>
to the environmental input.  But which theoretical limit on convergence 
<br>
are you talking about?
