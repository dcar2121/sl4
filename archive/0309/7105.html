<p>
I see this mailing list - a good place for discussions.
<br>
And I have many topics.
<br>
<p>Coming back to the concept of knowledge of impossible.
<br>
It was remarks which has arisen spontaneously but it's not casual.
<br>
It is based on my understanding of ideas suggested by the Stanislaw Lem.
<br>
Those who read his books will agree that
<br>
he has really not ordinary approach.
<br>
I shall quote his one statement:
<br>
&quot; There is no mind if there are minds of different capacity &quot;
<br>
In this book (Golem XIV) he is consistently carry out
<br>
the technological point of view on various problems.
<br>
Many of these problems deeply philosophical.
<br>
What is the technology -- I quote:
<br>
&quot;The Technology is a sphere of delivered tasks,
<br>
and also methods of their solutions&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;From this position I also spoke about knowledge of impossible.
</em><br>
Task on development of that that has the name but is not filled knowledge.
<br>
And without regard to it AI will be developed.
<br>
Why I so sure.
<br>
The task is put and it will be solved.
<br>
To state here all proofs for doubting I have'nt an opportunity. Criticize.
<br>
I think that this book
<br>
{
<br>
Stanislaw Lem 
<br>
Golem XIV
<br>
}
<br>
most precisely expresses the concept of Singularity.
<br>
Should become the reference book of all
<br>
who supports this concept.
<br>
<p>Specially for those who has reached to that of a place.
<br>
This letter may cause imperception.
<br>
In general may remain imperceptible.
<br>
I do not know all answers.
<br>
But precisely I know some questions which it is necessary to put.
