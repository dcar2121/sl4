<p><strong>attached mail follows:</strong><hr><p>
As a part of my ongoing and semi-voluntary colonization of useful networking
<br>
services, I was just dragged into tribe.net. It's sort of like the bastard
<br>
child of ryze.com and friendster.com, run through a good prep school and
<br>
given a nice haircut. The selling point for a group of people migrating from
<br>
friendster.com is the designed-in ability to create &quot;tribes&quot; of people;
<br>
something that friendster frowns on within their interface (but need to
<br>
start supporting before they lose their head start). So with this in mind, I
<br>
put together the &quot;Transhumanists&quot; tribe:
<br>
<p><a href="http://transhumanists.tribe.net">http://transhumanists.tribe.net</a>
<br>
<p>Those of you who participate in these things, feel free to jump on in. (That
<br>
means you ragged-trousered transhumanists on friendster too).
<br>
<p>(And I should note that Mike Lorrey seems to have created Transhumanism on
<br>
friendster, joining the ranks of other concept avatars in the system, with
<br>
the note: &quot;Hi everyone, I want to tell you about my friend Transhumanism!
<br>
Transhumanism is ... one hot babe. She's hip, cool, techie, and 1337 as all
<br>
4377. She has an open marriage thing going on, and is looking for more
<br>
partners in developing emergent phenomena, exploring the universe, and
<br>
transcending physical limits.&quot; Sorry, had to share.
<br>
<a href="http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=600401">http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=600401</a>).
<br>
<p>It has to be said, watching the evolution of these things is fascinating.
<br>
It's the scrabbling lizards on a glass wall stage; lots of momentum and
<br>
action, but not much purchase yet in the climb to something truly new. I'm
<br>
fairly sure there's something very cool, transforming and radically new
<br>
hiding somewhere in this whole six degrees and networking service thing, but
<br>
it remains to be seen what that actually might be.
