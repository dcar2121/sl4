</em><br>
<em>&gt; be &quot;prepared&quot;, meaning you can't just use raw text or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some other lowest denominator type of information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you considered applying the program to stock

<em>&gt; market data :)
</em><br>
<p><p>Raw bytes, no massaging.  In many cases, files and tarballs that I
<br>
downloaded off the Internet with many different types of data and file
<br>
formats.  The efficacy is independent of the kind of data since it codes
<br>
patterns in the abstract.  For the purposes of testing, the corpuses I've
<br>
collected range from raw genomics data to English literature collections to
<br>
source code tarballs and most anything else I could get my hands on.  I also
<br>
have some generator functions that can create arbitrary amounts of
<br>
mathematically characteristic data for testing purposes.
<br>
<p>There is only one tunable parameter (the data structure automatically adapts
<br>
itself to the nature of the data it is exposed to, so not much is needed),
<br>
and that has been locked into the same value for all the testing, mostly
<br>
because it was easier than changing it and it only has a minor impact on
<br>
efficiency anyway.  That parameter was roughly set to a good value for raw
<br>
genomics data.  Massaging or cleaning up the data would definitely improve
<br>
the efficiency and let the model converge faster, but that wasn't the point
<br>
of this series of tests.  However, I will be testing some simple pre-filter
<br>
code shortly that I can insert into the data stream.  The primary point of
<br>
pre-filtering is to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data stream; a
<br>
lot of raw file formats have a lot of extraneous crap in them, which is
<br>
handled just fine but hardly desirable.
<br>
<p>And yes, there is already keen hedge fund interest based upon the
<br>
capabilities of earlier versions.  Whereas I wasn't entirely satisfied with
<br>
certain aspects of those earlier generations at that time from a theoretical
<br>
standpoint, I am pretty much satisfied with the design and performance of
<br>
this system.  I've been working on these problems for many years and have
<br>
gone through numerous revisions.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And do you plan to keep this code to yourself or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; release to the world, in its developmental stage?
</em><br>
<p><p>It won't be released in a developmental stage regardless.  The code base is
<br>
quite small and clean but also very intricate; it would be very difficult to
<br>
hack unless you knew how it does what it does and why it does it in a
<br>
theoretical sense -- I wrote it and it is difficult even for me to think
<br>
through the interactions that lead to the correct emergent result.  I
<br>
haven't decided on what to do with the code precisely, but the formation of
<br>
a company is underway (name already selected, in fact) and it looks like I
<br>
may be able to collect a pretty interesting cast of Silicon Valley
<br>
characters for that venture.  The exact nature of the commercialization is
<br>
still being decided.  I've been stalling on commercialization until I could
<br>
prove this major milestone to my satisfaction.
<br>
<p>There is still work to be done, but it is becoming more a matter of tying up
<br>
loose ends and taking care of things I've put off, as well as simply
<br>
cleaning the code up a bit and adding some scalability enhancements for very
<br>
large systems.   I am inclined to put in my own VM since many of them don't
<br>
take well to being used like this, but the BSD VM that most of the testing
<br>
is done on is very fast and smiles the whole time.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
