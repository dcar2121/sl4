Brian Atkins quotes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The black hole survival guide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New Scientist vol 179 issue 2411 - 06 September 2003, page 26
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Falling into a black hole need not spell certain doom. Marcus Chown 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks forward to the ultimate thrill ride
</em><br>
...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fantastic voyage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Immediately ahead of you lies the event horizon, the point of no return 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for in-falling light and matter. Here time appears to slow to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standstill, so your friends see your gradually fading image frozen in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space forever. The truth (for you, anyway) is that you have long gone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the event horizon and are falling towards the singularity, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point with infinite density.
</em><br>
<p>What is this inter-subjectivity of the equivalence of time,
<br>
anyway?  Isn't this much like pointing to a frozen cryonics
<br>
patient and expostulating to others nearby, &quot;the truth for
<br>
our friend, here, is that he has long gone past the point
<br>
where he was reanimated; the several hours of our time since
<br>
his deanimation corresponds for him (in his nearly frozen
<br>
frame) of at least a couple of hours after his revival.&quot;
<br>
<p>The notion that we observe a black hole for hundreds of years
<br>
years and that meanwhile we can assert &quot;he (our friend) has
<br>
long gone over the event horizon&quot; may be ultimately arising
<br>
from such a feeling of temporal intersubjectivity.
<br>
<p>Before these remarks are taken as those of a crank, please
<br>
appreciate the following.  The first 5 are for sure true in
<br>
classical GR theory pertaining to black holes:
<br>
<p>1. Photon trajectories into a stationary black hole are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;symmetrical, in that a photon would take as long to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reach a tiny mirror suspended just above the event
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizon as it would take to make the return trip
<br>
<p>2. There is no latest time at which external observers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may receive such a photon, which takes this symmetrical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journey, nor receive a photon emitted by an infalling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astronaut
<br>
<p>3. the (external) time required for such a complete round
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trip is approximately ln(1/(r-2M)), where 2M is the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radius of the black hole, and r is the position of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mirror.  (This expression obviously diverges as r 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;becomes very close to the event horizon.)
<br>
<p>4. Though one has to be very careful when attempting to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;define simultaneity at remote distances, as Wheeler
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Ciufolini write on page 100 of &quot;Gravitation and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inertia&quot;, 1995,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, if spacetime is static we can find a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coordinate system where the metric is time independent,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore the coordinate time T required for an electro-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magnetic signal to go from a coordinate point A to any
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other coordinate point B is the same as the coordinate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time T for the signal to return from B to A.  Therefore,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one can consistently define *simultaneity* on the manifold
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between any two points using light signals between them.
<br>
<p>5. The Schwarzschild time coordinate of the event horizon is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infinite (though of course that would mean nothing to an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astronaut using his own infalling coordinate system).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This infinity is removed by transforming to the Kruskal-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Szekeres coordinates (see pages 833 through 835 of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gravitation&quot; by Wheeler et al.).  However, events that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occur in one coordinate system occur in all coordinate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;systems, and all finite values of t in Schwarzschild
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coordinates correspond to real positions of the infalling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astronaut, and all such positions (for finite t) are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*outside* the event horizons.
<br>
<p>6. Therefore, if the black hole exists for only finitely long,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(as in Hawking's theories), it becomes less than clear that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time-retarded astronaut crosses the event horizon before
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the black hole evaporates.
<br>
<p>7. At the conclusion of a lengthy debate I held on this topic
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on sci.physics.relativity, a Berlin physicist Ilja Schmelzer
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote on 23 August 2000 in my thread &quot;Why is the frozen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;star concept passe&quot;, evidently in my defense,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It radiates away in finite external Schwarzschild time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sure that it succeeds to form a horizon before
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radiating away?  Hint: go back in time from the event
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the outside observers observe late Hawking radiation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the black hole, and ask where it meets the infalling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That the black hole evaporates completely before even
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forming a horizon is not crackpot nonsense, but a scenario
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposed by Gerlach, PRD 14(6), 1976.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no substantive rejoinders to Schmelzer's post, so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long as I remained in the discussion (but see below).
<br>
<p>So I stand unconvinced that the event horizons can be said to
<br>
have finished forming anywhere.  The black hole FAQ at
<br>
<p><a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/bh_pub_faq.html">http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/bh_pub_faq.html</a>
<br>
<p>helps a little, but not much, as it seems at crucial points to
<br>
invoke this same suspect temporal intersubjectivity.
<br>
<p>Evidently, the discussion was going on about a month after I left:
