Hi folks,
<br>
<p>I've been meaning to say a little more on this, but I've been very busy working
<br>
on my own AGI stuff.  In this case, being busy has resulted in some remarkable
<br>
theoretical progress (more on that below).
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>As to whether or not there is one road to AI, I think a lot of you are
<br>
unnecessarily trying to segment The Problem into multiple exclusive domains.
<br>
Consider the problem of transportation.  You have many options: planes, trains,
<br>
boats, etc.  While one can develop a detailed engineering science about any one
<br>
mode of transportation, it tells you very little about engineering the other
<br>
modes of transportation because the engineering of any one mode is heavily laden
<br>
with assumptions that are both overt and subtle that pervade that particular
<br>
specialization.  If all you've ever done is study and engineer trains, you'll
<br>
have a great deal of difficulty transitioning to engineering airplanes even
<br>
though they are both solving the exact same problem: translating matter across
<br>
time/space.  In this way, there is an artificial perception that the principles
<br>
of each of these modes of transportation is more or less exclusive to that mode.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, someone who solely studied the physics and fundamentals of
<br>
moving matter across time/space can design a mode of transportation that looks
<br>
like any of the three nominally exclusive modes of transportation above simply
<br>
by constraining the parameters of the physics to a particular phase space.  It
<br>
is simpler for the physicist to design both an airplane AND an automobile than
<br>
for an automobile engineer to design an airplane.
<br>
<p>I think those stating that there are many solutions to AI are taking the view of
<br>
the automobile engineer.  Yes, the automobile is one solution to transportation,
<br>
but what will you do when you need to cross an ocean?  It is still an identical
<br>
problem in the abstract, just with a different set of constraining parameters.
<br>
A physicist who assumes no constraining parameters sees exactly one problem to
<br>
solve in ALL the cases.
<br>
<p>AI is fundamentally a single problem, even if we don't agree on what that single
<br>
problem is.  A pervasive problem in AGI research is that it is attacked as a
<br>
narrow engineering problem.  As a result, a lot of the solutions proposed in AI
<br>
research have dealt with problems outside their narrowly engineered cases by
<br>
cobbling on engineering solutions designed for different phase spaces.  So you
<br>
end up with &quot;flying cars&quot; and &quot;car-boats&quot;, and when those don't work out, they
<br>
attempt &quot;flying car-boats&quot;.  Which inevitably ends up being a very screwed up
<br>
kludge by the time it gets even vaguely useful.  In this way, they completely
<br>
lose sight of precisely what the problem is they are actually trying to solve.
<br>
What should happen in these cases is that you step back and abstract the
<br>
underlying principles until the engineering solutions theoretically intersect.
<br>
<p>What some of you are calling &quot;many roads&quot; to AGI looks more like a distinction
<br>
without a difference to me -- it is all solving the same problem -- unless there
<br>
is some fundamental disagreement as to what constitutes AGI.  The danger is that
<br>
a lot of people have a tendency to conflate the solution they have with the
<br>
problem they are nominally solving.  Better solutions will be effective across a
<br>
greater percentage of the phase space for The Problem.  Therefore, the better
<br>
the solution the higher the probability that it will intersect with other
<br>
solutions in a given part of the phase space.  Solutions that overlap heavily in
<br>
the phase space will also overlap heavily in implementation because the
<br>
underlying fundamentals and parameters that determine where they exist in the
<br>
phase space reflect the nature of the implementation.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>I've been very busy with AGI work over the last few months, largely with
<br>
refinements to the algorithm design and implementation.  The design testbed is
<br>
Python (which works great for this), but Python's memory management is extremely
<br>
slow and inefficient such that testing/proving the theoretical correctness of
<br>
the design in large-scale would have been painfully slow and taxed the memory
<br>
more than I would have liked.  Python still works well for verifying code
<br>
correctness though, and I have libs that make porting to C++ relatively easy
<br>
(though still time-consuming).  I finished porting the Python to C++ a couple
<br>
days ago, which has really allowed me to fully exercise the engine in real
<br>
theoretical spaces of interest such that crucial results can now rise above the
<br>
noise floor, especially in terms of the effective memory available.  The C++
<br>
implementation is very fast even on my dev system (533MHz G4), at least three
<br>
orders of magnitude faster than Python speed-wise and at least an order of
<br>
magnitude more efficient memory-wise.
<br>
<p>One of the core design features of my computational model is that the entire
<br>
system is an extremely scalable Solomonoff induction engine in its own right.
<br>
As is well known, SI implementations have the problem that their memory
<br>
requirements grow exponentially with the complexity of the system encoded into
<br>
them.  However, the effective exponent is attenuated as a function of the
<br>
entropy of the information being encoded into them.  An SI implementation with a
<br>
reasonably high theoretical efficiency (and hence a smaller exponent) can also
<br>
theoretically show convergent behavior (i.e. exponent &lt; 1) across a greater
<br>
range of possible data sources as the entropy factor attenuates the resource
<br>
exponent by a fixed amount.
<br>
<p>Designing any SI implementation that exhibits a very high theoretical efficiency
<br>
is a hard problem; I've been working on it for years.  Early work on this led to
<br>
designs that while better than anything existing still showed sub-optimal
<br>
convergence in the cases where they did converge, or didn't converge on datasets
<br>
where I know humans do exhibit convergence.
<br>
<p>With the minor design tweaks (really just refining it and making it more
<br>
elegant) and reimplementation in C++ (which mostly just makes large-scale
<br>
testing practical), this aspect of the system is now exhibiting very high
<br>
theoretical efficiency such that it exhibits real convergence on essentially
<br>
every test corpus that SHOULD show convergence, and at a level that is
<br>
definitely comparable to human capability.  This includes a pronounced
<br>
convergence on things such as the English language text corpus that I use.
<br>
(Finding junk to feed it just to see what it would do with it kept me up for
<br>
hours -- mildly addictive, that.)
<br>
<p>(For those that don't know what &quot;convergence&quot; translates into, it essentially is
<br>
the measure of the ability of a system to discover and efficiently encode
<br>
complex patterns in an arbitrary system.  The resource roll-off is the result of
<br>
efficient high-order models automatically being generated as it is exposed to
<br>
data, classic Kolmogorov compression. In a sense, it measures the ability of a
<br>
given system to grok the essence of another system it is modeling in some finite
<br>
amount of space, in a very pure mathematical fashion.  In the case of my
<br>
software, actual performance is now very close to the theoretical limit in this
<br>
regard.)
<br>
<p>I'm also measuring pretty close to theoretical on a number of other key aspects
<br>
of the system now.  As one might expect, improvements in the theoretical design
<br>
elegance are generating metrics that are closer to theoretical limits.  The
<br>
primary limitation right now is inadequate memory; the convergence on things
<br>
that matter to me, like language, wasn't very clear until I got the 10x memory
<br>
boost by porting to C++ because the resource roll-off was mostly above the
<br>
threshold of the memory available (or more precisely, allocable nodes).  There
<br>
is a lot of work to be done, but the hard part is mostly done now.  Actually
<br>
proving highly optimal convergence for complexity spaces that have been
<br>
intractable is a major capability milestone.
<br>
<p>There is a lot of other stuff going on behind the scenes, but I am extremely
<br>
pleased with this bit of design verification meeting theoretical targets.  I
<br>
knew I was close, but this was key.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
