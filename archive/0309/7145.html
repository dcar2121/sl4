Hi Ben
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Sorry if my comments seemed too skeptical and not understanding enough of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nature of your enterprise.  I get that way sometimes, especially when my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;obsession with AI leads me to cut my sleeping hours too short ;-)
</em><br>
<p>It's Ok, Ben, your original comments seem 'fair an balance' enough for me.
<br>
You have show a lot of shelf-restrain from your natural bias against, well,
<br>
a competing project. After all this is a project that has chosen a very
<br>
different approach from yours, and believe me, competing researchers and CEO
<br>
of competing companies are not usually as kind as we are being with each
<br>
other :-)
<br>
Besides, from your point of view, we have probably popped up into existence
<br>
from nowhere, so your scepticism is not only unsurprising, but also necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I certainly agree that having a large-scale distributed platform for neural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computing will be a very good thing.  And I'm glad you agree that, to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;real value out of this network for AI (or for theoretical neuroscience, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that matter), a lot of hard thinking will need to be done regarding the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;specific design of the neural network being run on this exciting new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;platform.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree, a lot of hard thinking is needed, but specially a lot of
<br>
testing. That is what justifies building the CCortex Cluster prototype in
<br>
the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I agree that neuroscience, in itself, does not currently provide enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guidance to create a highly intelligent, large-scale neural net.  What it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provides is general guidance, and the rest of the architecture of your NN
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will have to be figured out through intuitive combination of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from neuroscience, psychology, computer science, with a healthy dose of pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guesswork.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. But as a company we must concentrate on our strengths, software
<br>
development and computer infrastructure deployment. We will let other much
<br>
better suited groups do the neuroscience research work. Of course we can
<br>
only hope they publish it, so that we can read it and incorporate it on our
<br>
model.
<br>
Incidentally, there are a few millionaires around that are already using
<br>
some astonishing money for doing just that, neuroscience basic research.
<br>
Jeff Hawkins has been doing that for a few years now, and Paul Allen has
<br>
just decided to donate $100 million to help 'decipher' the brain. Hey, I'm
<br>
not competing with Paul! I think I let him hire the neuroscientists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you ever feel interested in doing some collaborative thinking on how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structure your mega neural network in a useful way, I'm sure that both Peter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Voss and I would be very willing to toss around some ideas together with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your team.  While we don't have hardware infrastructures on the scale of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yours, we've been thinking about how to structure quasi-neural computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems for quite some time (although my own AI design Novamente, isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really all that quasi-neural anymore, it did start out that way).
</em><br>
<p>We do welcome the collaboration with other researches. In fact, that was
<br>
partially the porpuse of our presentation: To reach groups like yours :-) 
<br>
<p>Best Regards,
<br>
Marcos Guillen
