<em>&gt; &gt;If you ever feel interested in doing some collaborative thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;structure your mega neural network in a useful way, I'm sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that both Peter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Voss and I would be very willing to toss around some ideas together with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;your team.  While we don't have hardware infrastructures on the scale of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;yours, we've been thinking about how to structure quasi-neural computing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;systems for quite some time (although my own AI design Novamente, isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;really all that quasi-neural anymore, it did start out that way).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We do welcome the collaboration with other researches. In fact, that was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partially the porpuse of our presentation: To reach groups like yours :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best Regards,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marcos Guillen
</em><br>
<p>Although my Novamente system is NOT neural net based, I've thought a lot
<br>
about how to make a neural net based AI system.
<br>
<p>The reason I didn't choose the NN path is that it seemed to me it would be
<br>
*much* more consumptive of computing resources than the Novamente approach.
<br>
I.e., it seemed to me that the NN approach relied on a lot of redundancy.
<br>
But on the scale you're working, you can afford a fair bit of redundancy, so
<br>
you can probably do some interesting things.
<br>
<p>Specifically, I've figured out some modifications to the standard hebbian
<br>
learning (long-term potentiation) rules, which seem to lead to neural nets
<br>
whose behavior approximates probabilistic logic on an &quot;emergent level&quot; (i.e.
<br>
on the level of bundles of connections between neural clusters).  The
<br>
dynamics of the average weights of the connection-bundles over time will
<br>
often approximate probabilistic logic in a certain sense.  So it's a cell
<br>
assembly model that seems to give rise to symbolic logic in an emergent
<br>
sense.  At least, to certain parts of logic -- I haven't yet pursued that
<br>
train of thought to its conclusion to see how far it can be pushed.
<br>
<p>So, when you get to the point that you've got your big-ass neural net
<br>
running and your problem is making it learn, it would be interesting to talk
<br>
to you about these &quot;hebbian logic&quot; learning rules and their possible
<br>
applicability in your architecture.
<br>
<p>This is not something I'm currently actively working on; and nor have I
<br>
published it yet, more due to lack of time to write it up carefully than due
<br>
to any desire for secrecy...
<br>
