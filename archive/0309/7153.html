<p><em>&gt; First, you need to know something about the way dreams work for me, and in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular, an odd thing about the way I wake up.  Usually, like everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I forget my dreams.  When I'm suddenly woken up, for example, by an alarm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clock or by my cellphone ringing, it seems - I'm not quite sure if this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is happening, but it's the explanation that seems most likely - it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems as if the last fifteen seconds of mental imagery are still &quot;in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loop&quot; when I wake up, so I remember them too, just as if they were lucid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   So the memory I actually have is of waking up, and then five seconds or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifteen seconds *later*, the phone rings.  With an experience like that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's easy to see why anyone less than a dedicated rationalist would assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychic powers; &quot;Oh, look, I become lucid fifteen seconds *before* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phone rings, I must be psychic&quot;.  Sometimes I'll even apparently remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have a dream in which an alarm goes off in my dream, which wakes me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up, and then five seconds later the alarm goes off; one needs to have done
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite a lot of reading in cognitive science before one looks at that and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says, &quot;Timing fault in memory formation - yes, the brain really is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fragile&quot;, and not &quot;I had a precognitive dream.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>As I understand it, the brain also is capable of generating quite a bit of 
<br>
internal imagery/&quot;story&quot; around any external stimulus in a very short time 
<br>
period.  So one explanation is that the brain generated what seemed like an 
<br>
amount of content that must have been responding to the stimulus long before 
<br>
it actually happened.  Switching between sleep and waking states causes the 
<br>
assumptions of one to be sometimes used on the material/experience within the 
<br>
other. 
<br>
<p>There is also the phenomenon of lucid dreaming where one is partially awake in 
<br>
the sense of being aware within a dream and being able to direct it.  Many 
<br>
people do this fairly often spontaneously and the ability is trainable to 
<br>
some extent.   Some friends use this ability to do creative problem solving 
<br>
within the context of a dream and retain the solutions found upon waking.  I 
<br>
have done that a few times by accident.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This led me to ponder the problem of dream memories and personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity.  I now remember having experiences that I would not remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I had not been woken up by an alarm clock; I remember those apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lucid dream experiences, and those &quot;inserted&quot; memories, as if they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of my ordinary life continuity.  What happens to the person who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences the dreams I have and *don't* remember?  Did I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience the dream of the alarm going off, or was the memory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufactured and inserted without ever being experienced?  Are *all*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams manufactured and inserted without ever being experienced?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why would you consider it a separate person who had the dream experiences that 
<br>
you do not remember?  Do you even remember all of your waking experiences?  I 
<br>
don't see any real grounds for believing that the dreams were not actually 
<br>
exprienced. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is where we stand at the moment I had my anthropic dream.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My cellphone rang and woke me up.  I apparently remembered becoming lucid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my dream a few seconds before the cellphone woke me.  And my &quot;inserted&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dream experience leading up to the cellphone ringing was the thought:  &quot;If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't wake up now, this experience will not have existed in retrospect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Therefore, since I'm now having this experience, something will wake me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, what this *feels* like is this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're dreaming, and your dream turns lucid, and you think to yourself:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If I don't wake up now, this experience won't have existed in retrospect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Therefore, since I'm having this experience, something will wake me up.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I almost invaribly wake myself up when I am finished with an 
<br>
interesting stretch of lucid dreaming.   It feels like &quot;wake up and remember 
<br>
this&quot;.    It doesn't require an external stimulus.  But such a stimulus might 
<br>
be the reason the person would find more explicable.    Yeah, this stuff does 
<br>
get a bit twisted.
