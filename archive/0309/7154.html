Hi Eli,

<p><em>&gt; Our recent Transhuman Atlanta gathering reminded me of an interesting 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting dream I have ever had in my life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, you need to know something about the way dreams work for me, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in particular, an odd thing about the way I wake up.  Usually, like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone, I forget my dreams.  When I'm suddenly woken up, for example, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by an alarm clock or by my cellphone ringing, it seems - I'm not quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure if this is what is happening, but it's the explanation that seems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most likely - it seems as if the last fifteen seconds of mental imagery 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are still &quot;in my loop&quot; when I wake up, so I remember them too, just as if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they were lucid. So the memory I actually have is of waking up, and then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; five seconds or fifteen seconds *later*, the phone rings.  With an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience like that, it's easy to see why anyone less than a dedicated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationalist would assume psychic powers; &quot;Oh, look, I become lucid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fifteen seconds *before* the phone rings, I must be psychic&quot;.  Sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll even apparently remember that I have a dream in which an alarm goes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off in my dream, which wakes me up, and then five seconds later the alarm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes off; one needs to have done quite a lot of reading in cognitive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science before one looks at that and says, &quot;Timing fault in memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formation - yes, the brain really is that fragile&quot;, and not &quot;I had a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precognitive dream.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This led me to ponder the problem of dream memories and personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continuity.  I now remember having experiences that I would not remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I had not been woken up by an alarm clock; I remember those apparently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lucid dream experiences, and those &quot;inserted&quot; memories, as if they were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of my ordinary life continuity.  What happens to the person who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiences the dreams I have and *don't* remember?  Did I really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience the dream of the alarm going off, or was the memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manufactured and inserted without ever being experienced?  Are *all* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams manufactured and inserted without ever being experienced?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where we stand at the moment I had my anthropic dream.
</em><br>
<p>Up to this point in your account, I would say it makes little difference 
<br>
from your own perspective whether they're &quot;manufactured&quot; or &quot;experienced&quot;. 
<br>
You could ask the same question of waking memories. I don't think you can 
<br>
tell by introspection after the event, and if the memory is &quot;the same&quot; [as 
<br>
what you think it would be if swap(manufactured,experienced)], the end 
<br>
result (on learning, etc) should be the same. The only way to determine the 
<br>
dream origin would be to have some kind of snapshot of earlier mental 
<br>
states to compare with, to see if the dream memory was first formed (or 
<br>
first accessible) before you were woken.
<br>
<p>Now that you mention it, I think I've had similar &quot;retrospective&quot; 
<br>
experiences on being awakened suddenly - the most dramatic of which 
<br>
occurred on having a brick thrown through the (very large, double-glazed) 
<br>
window beneath which I was sleeping! Obviously I woke up rather abruptly 
<br>
with a massive adrenaline rush; my apparent immediately preceding memory 
<br>
was an unpleasant semi-nightmarish dream about, well, suffice to say an 
<br>
accident involving a lot of shock, noise, breaking glass, destruction of 
<br>
buildings, etc. I'd previously put this down to nerve-jangling coincidence, 
<br>
but yours seems a potential explanation, especially given the lack of 
<br>
mental clarity when I woke up - my memories of the moments afterwards are 
<br>
confused as well. _Thank you_ for sharing this!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What happens to the person who doesn't remember?
</em><br>
<p>Whether they are manufactured or really experienced, I guess that if 
<br>
forgotten (or just not manufactured, if you don't wake), the dream still 
<br>
does its stuff in terms of whatever learning or processing function it 
<br>
serves, and the lack of memory of the process itself becomes largely 
<br>
irrelevant. Probably the end result is &quot;better&quot; (in the sense of improved 
<br>
learning / personality adaptation to experience) than for the interrupted 
<br>
dreamer, who presumably doesn't finish the learning process.
<br>
<p>Question: if &quot;manufacture&quot; is what happens, what could be the evolutionary 
<br>
benefit, as opposed to remembering nothing?  (of course this depends 
<br>
whether my assumption holds about forgotten dreams still having an effect)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My cellphone rang and woke me up.  I apparently remembered becoming lucid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my dream a few seconds before the cellphone woke me.  And my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;inserted&quot; dream experience leading up to the cellphone ringing was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought:  &quot;If I don't wake up now, this experience will not have existed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in retrospect. Therefore, since I'm now having this experience, something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will wake me up.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>It's fascinating that you remember it down to the level of individual 
<br>
thoughts; I don't think I ever get that. Dreams are more of an emotional 
<br>
sensation for me; regardless of how I wake up, I can't usually recall 
<br>
speech or specific thoughts - if there are any. Events, yes; details, no. 
<br>
This raises the obvious question: is it the dream, the memory, or my 
<br>
reality testing during the dream that lacks detail? - since the dream seems 
<br>
entirely convincing while I'm &quot;experiencing&quot; it. (Hence I've not yet 
<br>
managed to &quot;wake up&quot; within a dream to achieve lucid dreaming - the usual 
<br>
techniques involve training yourself to habitually perform various forms of 
<br>
reality testing.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, what this *feels* like is this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're dreaming, and your dream turns lucid, and you think to yourself: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If I don't wake up now, this experience won't have existed in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retrospect. Therefore, since I'm having this experience, something will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wake me up.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And then, a moment later, the cellphone rings and wakes you up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The illusion of a spooky anthropic effect was *very* strong.
</em><br>
<p>What exactly do you mean by &quot;anthropic effect&quot;? That it seemed as though 
<br>
there was some kind of causal relation from the dream to the trigger which 
<br>
woke you, rather than vice versa? That your seeming to experience the dream 
<br>
(as opposed to merely manufacturing it :] ) seemed to trigger the alarm 
<br>
call and subsequent wakeup? (&quot;It was the way it was because you experienced 
<br>
it&quot;.)
<br>
<p>I'm not sure how this fits in with anthropic theory, since the phone could 
<br>
still have woken you if there was no causal relation from dream to phone, 
<br>
and the dream could still have been manufactured afterwards, yet you would 
<br>
still have the same memories to ask why and reach the same conclusion (or 
<br>
not)!
<br>
<p>What was discussed in Atlanta in relation to this?
<br>
<p>Nick
