<p>
Marcos, as I said in email to you and on this list, I like your
<br>
architecture and the fact that it allows you to easily update the
<br>
simulation techniques you use.  I'm very pleased to see someone taking
<br>
on a project of this sort, and in particular doing so without the
<br>
constraints of a short-term project.
<br>
<p>I also agree with you that we don't know yet exactly what level of
<br>
granularity will be required to simulate the brain.  My only complaint
<br>
is that we can be fairly certain that the required level of
<br>
granularity is quite a bit beyond what you currently estimate.  How do
<br>
we know this?  Because other groups have spent years working on neural
<br>
simulations and have found that, without getting down to well below
<br>
single-neuron resolution, their simulations produce results that are
<br>
wildly different from what we see in actual brains*.  
<br>
<p>So again, I congratulate you on the audacity of trying to pull off
<br>
this project.  Your approach on the software side seems sound.  I
<br>
would only suggest that you reconsider your estimates of how far away
<br>
you are from being able to accurately simulate a real human brain.
