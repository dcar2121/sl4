<p>
Our recent Transhuman Atlanta gathering reminded me of an interesting 
<br>
dream I recently had, and which I would like to share with any anthropic 
<br>
theorists out there.  In fact, this is probably the most philosophically 
<br>
interesting dream I have ever had in my life.
<br>
<p>First, you need to know something about the way dreams work for me, and in 
<br>
particular, an odd thing about the way I wake up.  Usually, like everyone, 
<br>
I forget my dreams.  When I'm suddenly woken up, for example, by an alarm 
<br>
clock or by my cellphone ringing, it seems - I'm not quite sure if this is 
<br>
what is happening, but it's the explanation that seems most likely - it 
<br>
seems as if the last fifteen seconds of mental imagery are still &quot;in my 
<br>
loop&quot; when I wake up, so I remember them too, just as if they were lucid. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the memory I actually have is of waking up, and then five seconds or 
<br>
fifteen seconds *later*, the phone rings.  With an experience like that, 
<br>
it's easy to see why anyone less than a dedicated rationalist would assume 
<br>
psychic powers; &quot;Oh, look, I become lucid fifteen seconds *before* the 
<br>
phone rings, I must be psychic&quot;.  Sometimes I'll even apparently remember 
<br>
that I have a dream in which an alarm goes off in my dream, which wakes me 
<br>
up, and then five seconds later the alarm goes off; one needs to have done 
<br>
quite a lot of reading in cognitive science before one looks at that and 
<br>
says, &quot;Timing fault in memory formation - yes, the brain really is that 
<br>
fragile&quot;, and not &quot;I had a precognitive dream.&quot;
<br>
<p>This led me to ponder the problem of dream memories and personal 
<br>
continuity.  I now remember having experiences that I would not remember 
<br>
if I had not been woken up by an alarm clock; I remember those apparently 
<br>
lucid dream experiences, and those &quot;inserted&quot; memories, as if they were 
<br>
part of my ordinary life continuity.  What happens to the person who 
<br>
experiences the dreams I have and *don't* remember?  Did I really 
<br>
experience the dream of the alarm going off, or was the memory 
<br>
manufactured and inserted without ever being experienced?  Are *all* 
<br>
dreams manufactured and inserted without ever being experienced?
<br>
<p>This is where we stand at the moment I had my anthropic dream.
<br>
<p>My cellphone rang and woke me up.  I apparently remembered becoming lucid 
<br>
in my dream a few seconds before the cellphone woke me.  And my &quot;inserted&quot; 
<br>
dream experience leading up to the cellphone ringing was the thought:  &quot;If 
<br>
I don't wake up now, this experience will not have existed in retrospect. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, since I'm now having this experience, something will wake me up.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, what this *feels* like is this:
<br>
<p>You're dreaming, and your dream turns lucid, and you think to yourself: 
<br>
&quot;If I don't wake up now, this experience won't have existed in retrospect. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, since I'm having this experience, something will wake me up.&quot;
<br>
<p>And then, a moment later, the cellphone rings and wakes you up.
<br>
<p>The illusion of a spooky anthropic effect was *very* strong.
