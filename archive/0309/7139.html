<em>&gt;I saw the same talk as Ben, and his post pretty much sums it up. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current model of the brain this group has is rather simplistic, to say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the least. On the other hand, the architecture of their system seems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to allow fairly rapid additions to the model.

<em>&gt;&gt; I just saw a talk by one of the leaders of this enterprise, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; at the Accelerating Change 2003 conference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It's an interesting effort, but they seem to have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; particular insight into the operation of the human brain ... 
</em><br>
<p><p>Yea, I agree. At Artificial Development, we have no particular insight into
<br>
the operation of the human brain, and we are rather simplistic folks.
<br>
Further more, we are not that smart, either. Nothing to see here, keep on
<br>
moving :-)
<br>
<p>Anyway, I would like to thank you both, Ramez and Ben, for attending our
<br>
presentation, it was a pleasure talking for such a qualified audience. It is
<br>
great to be able to exchange ideas with people like you.
<br>
<p>We are computer engineers, no neurologist, and we are aware that our
<br>
immediate goals may not seem that interesting from a theorist perspective.
<br>
Our goal is to build a system capable of algorithmically operating over
<br>
billions of neuron and trillions of connections, in real time. Sounds fun to
<br>
you? Well, for us it is, and it's quit a challenge: CCortex data matrix is a
<br>
number of times bigger than Google.
<br>
<p>You seem to be concern with what you perceive as a 'simplistic' approach, in
<br>
what specific operations do we perform, and what parameters we are
<br>
considering. Well, so we do. We don't think that there is enough knowledge
<br>
out there to define the precise operations we must necessarily perform to
<br>
correctly update our artificial brain. We do not have any special,
<br>
'particular insight' into the human brain, no mystic, sudden revelation here.
<br>
In fact, the only thing we are really sure about is that neither we, neither
<br>
other competing groups know enough at this point; and those are precisely
<br>
the foundations of our project: A versatile, flexible, powerful, easy to
<br>
adapt, pure software implementations.
<br>
<p>By design, we can modify the central algorithm governing the update over the
<br>
weekend, to accommodate different theories. We keep individual memory space
<br>
for each neuron to accommodate a number of fields of updatable data
<br>
pertaining to the neuron body,  plus vector, positioning and weigh data
<br>
fields for and average 1,000 connections per neuron. What fields? Those we
<br>
deem necessary in each run. What operations? Any operation we may need. Most
<br>
operation has low computing requirements, while the rest are being
<br>
approximated or pre-calculated and stored on a database. After all, after a
<br>
few cycles, the bulk of the possible operations to perform in our data space
<br>
has been already calculated, and is susceptible of being sampled, stored and
<br>
reused with minimum error margins.
<br>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that, also by design, we are a privately held company,
<br>
and we are not aiming for the sort term. We do not depend of outside
<br>
financing, and we do not need to spend that much time with things like
<br>
customers, academic peer approval, or even (mostly nonexistent) competitors.
<br>
And yes, we are here to stay, but don't expect our 1 week old cluster to be
<br>
ready for prime time any time soon: this are just the first steps on a long
<br>
term project, and it's no time yet for Eliezer to start freaking out :-)
