</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; degrees of freedom in U(x) either.  Of course I am only reasoning 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitively here, and I may have gotten the math wrong.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;From what I remember, you can always find an infinite set of pairs of
</em><br>
U' and P' that satisfy the constraints of decision theory, and P' != P.
<br>
I think in most cases you will get different volitional orderings from
<br>
these U'. I can look up the math details if you're interested.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But, mostly my reply is that I'm not using the economist assumption that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have to construct U(x) and P(x) by looking exclusively at people's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices.  From a volitionist standpoint, what I would like to do is open 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up people's heads and look at their mind-state, figure out what systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are working, what they contain, what actual system is producing the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choices, and then, having this functional decomposition, ask which parts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have U(x) nature and which parts have P(x) nature, bearing in mind that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will overlap.  Existing cognitive psychology actually goes quite a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways toward doing this.
</em><br>
<p>So how do you determine whether the subject volitionally wants you to
<br>
open up his head and look inside?
<br>
<p>But putting that aside, the main point I want to make is that I don't
<br>
see what difference exists between the utility function and the
<br>
probability function that makes you want to respect a person's utility
<br>
function but not his probability function. Both functions need to
<br>
satisfy certain constraints according to decision theory, but other
<br>
than that they are completely subjective and arbitrary. Why not have
<br>
the Friendly AI implement an alternative moral theory where the AI
<br>
makes decisions for a person according to his own probability function
<br>
but substituting the AI's idea of a &quot;correct&quot; utility function for the
<br>
subject's? That makes just as much sense to me as volitionism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the subject's perspective, both of these approaches are equally
</em><br>
bad. In both cases the AI is doing things that hurt his expected
<br>
utility. Why should the fact that the AI respects his utility function
<br>
function be more of a consolation than the fact that the AI respects 
<br>
his probability function?
