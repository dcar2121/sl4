<p><p>Big caveat: the website says almost nothing about the technological details, so

this is purely speculation and maybe he has something slick up his sleeve.  If
<br>
not vapor, at the very least it seems like a retread of well-trod areas.  Given
<br>
the current state of knowledge re:NN this seems like an exercise in futility or
<br>
perhaps naivete, though I'm sure there are plenty of people who will disagree.

If the fellow can't explain why his flavor of the month will work on a small
<br>
scale, it seems premature to attempt it on a large scale.
<br>
<p>Several other non-commercial and commercial research groups have tried large
<br>
neural networks on PC clusters (and with much less lofty goals), with pretty
<br>
mediocre results.  The general analysis has generally been that the cluster
<br>
computing environment is badly matched to the algorithm space of neural
<br>
networks, and you don't get anywhere near the scaling factor that you want to
<br>
justify the cluster even if you make sub-optimal design changes to your
<br>
theoretical model.
