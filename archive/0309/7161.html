</em><br>
<p>Actually, one section seems quite on-topic to me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I don't think we know anything with any confidence about what dreams 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are for,&quot; says psychiatrist Robert Stickgold of Harvard Medical School. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But he has some ideas. Stickgold believes that one of the critical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functions of dreaming is information processing, including memory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consolidation (see main story). But he's recently extended the idea into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a wider concept of information processing he calls &quot;finding meaning&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes when you have a difficult decision to make, all the rational 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking in the world won't give you the answer, he points out. So what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you do? &quot;You go home that night and you sleep on it,&quot; says Stickgold. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By the morning you somehow have the answer even though you've gained no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new information overnight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is dreaming during REM sleep, he thinks, that performs this magical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision-making process. As you dream, your brain runs through imaginary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios, testing your emotional response to them without rationality 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting in the way. He now has experimental evidence that REM sleep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promotes creative thought, allowing you to bring together widely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differing concepts you would never link while awake.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The evidence comes from a common cognitive test of a process called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priming. Normally the investigator would show someone a word, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quickly flash up another, either real or meaningless. The task is to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work out whether it's a real word or not. If the second word is related 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the first, say the pair were &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, then the decision 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time is usually significantly faster than, say, &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;paper&quot;. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason, according to conventional theory, is that the first word has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; primed the brain to recognise related words by activating networks of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associated concepts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stickgold, though, was not interested in wakeful consciousness. He 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tested people who had just been roused from REM sleep. The result was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the exact opposite of wakefulness. The more distantly related the second 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word, the faster the subjects recognised it. &quot;In REM sleep, the brain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignores the obvious in favour of the crazy, the unexpected or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bizarre,&quot; Stickgold says. &quot;It's biased towards activating weak, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-obvious and potentially useful connections.&quot; And this, he says, is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what allows us to make meaning out of complex information. It might even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the origin of creativity.
</em><br>
<p>ISTR that GISAI talks about similar states.
