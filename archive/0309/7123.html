For those intrigued by the idea of whether it would be possible to 
<br>
survive within a blackhole...
<br>
------------------------------------
<br>
The black hole survival guide
<br>
<p>New Scientist vol 179 issue 2411 - 06 September 2003, page 26
<br>
<p><p>Falling into a black hole need not spell certain doom. Marcus Chown 
<br>
looks forward to the ultimate thrill ride
<br>
<p><p>COULD you fall into a black hole and avoid being crushed by its intense 
<br>
gravity? Because the laws of physics break down under these conditions, 
<br>
it has widely been considered impossible even to imagine what would 
<br>
happen deep inside these fearsome objects. But Igor Novikov thought it 
<br>
was worth trying anyway. And by probing exactly how the laws of physics 
<br>
break down, he has challenged the conventional view that a trip to a 
<br>
black hole spells certain death.
<br>
<p>Of course, Novikov, who heads the Theoretical Astrophysics Center in 
<br>
Copenhagen, Denmark, is not planning to visit a black hole. But 
<br>
physicists still consider the problem worth thinking about; these 
<br>
calculations can give us insight into what happens where the fabric of 
<br>
space-time becomes so tremendously warped that it shatters into droplets 
<br>
or quanta. &quot;Here the general theory of relativity, Einstein's theory of 
<br>
gravity, is no longer valid,&quot; says Eric Poisson of the University of 
<br>
Guelph in Ontario, Canada. &quot;We are into the mysterious domain of quantum 
<br>
gravity where no theory yet exists to tell us what to expect.&quot; So 
<br>
looking at the internal structure of black holes might tell us how to 
<br>
formulate a more consistent theory of the universe.
<br>
<p>Black holes - regions of space-time from which nothing can escape - are 
<br>
rooted in Einstein's general theory of relativity. Soon after Einstein 
<br>
published his theory describing gravity as warps in space-time, the 
<br>
German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild used the theory to show that if a 
<br>
large star were squeezed into a small enough point, it would create such 
<br>
a strong gravitational field that nothing, not even light, could escape 
<br>
once it had moved beyond a certain point: the &quot;event horizon&quot;.
<br>
<p>Inside the event horizon of a black hole, space-time is radically 
<br>
transformed. Einstein showed that matter or energy stretch space and 
<br>
time, rather like someone standing on a trampoline. Yet no matter how 
<br>
much the fabric of space-time warps, space and time always act together 
<br>
to preserve the speed of light (one of the effects of this is that 
<br>
clocks run slower in the gravitational field close to Earth than they do 
<br>
far out in space). The tremendous gravity inside a black hole distorts 
<br>
space-time so much, that the only way to safeguard the speed of light 
<br>
travelling in this region is for space and time to swap roles. This has 
<br>
an extraordinary consequence: instead of being a place, the centre of a 
<br>
black hole exists in the future and you can no more avoid it than you 
<br>
can avoid tomorrow. At the end of this journey is the singularity, a 
<br>
point of infinite density that is widely believed to destroy anyone or 
<br>
anything that hits it.
<br>
<p>The devastation is caused by &quot;tidal&quot; forces: because gravity varies so 
<br>
quickly near a black hole, the pull on your head would be much greater 
<br>
than the pull on your feet. Theorists calculate that these tidal forces 
<br>
increase indefinitely very close to the singularity: matter gets torn 
<br>
apart, space-time would shred and you would be utterly destroyed.
<br>
<p>But it turns out that the existence of this murderous singularity does 
<br>
not necessarily spell doom. Because stars and galaxies rotate, there is 
<br>
a good chance that any black hole we encounter would too. In the early 
<br>
1960s, New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr worked out that this rotation 
<br>
drags the space-time surrounding the black hole like a tornado, 
<br>
profoundly altering its internal structure. His work showed that a 
<br>
second horizon forms inside a rotating black hole. Novikov has now shown 
<br>
that this second horizon changes everything 
<br>
(www.arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0304052).
<br>
<p>Shortly after a rotating black hole forms, this inner horizon is little 
<br>
more than a slight wrinkle in space-time whose exact position depends on 
<br>
the speed of rotation. For the fastest spinning black holes, it sits 
<br>
halfway between the event horizon and the singularity. But it does not 
<br>
stay that way for ever. The extreme gravitational field inside the black 
<br>
hole whips all the in-falling light and matter up to extremely high 
<br>
energy. The colossal energy of this junk changes the character of the 
<br>
inner event horizon, warping it so much that the slight wrinkle in 
<br>
space-time becomes a deep fold. To preserve the speed of light in this 
<br>
region, time speeds up - it passes so quickly that the inner horizon 
<br>
concentrates junk from all times, even from events that happen far into 
<br>
the universe's future.
<br>
<p>The result of this is that the inner event horizon concentrates so much 
<br>
light and matter that it rapidly turns into another singularity, one 
<br>
that concentrates an infinite amount of energy into a finite volume. 
<br>
Astrophysicists call it a &quot;mass-inflation&quot; singularity.
<br>
<p>And it is this mass-inflation singularity that gets you out of a black 
<br>
hole alive. As well as junk falling into the black hole, Novikov 
<br>
believes that the inner event horizon also dredges up stuff scattered 
<br>
from deep within the black hole. This interacts with the incoming flow 
<br>
of light and matter, and &quot;gravitational feedback&quot;, where the 
<br>
ever-increasing amount of stuff present causes an ever-increasing 
<br>
gravitational pull, causes the radius of the inner horizon to shrink. 
<br>
Eventually the mass-inflation singularity swallows the more dangerous 
<br>
singularity, leaving a tamer, less dangerous kind of black hole.
<br>
<p>Calculations show that the tidal forces around a mass-inflation 
<br>
singularity may not last long enough to deform an object. Because 
<br>
space-time is so warped around there, passing near the singularity is 
<br>
the fastest part of the journey. That gives anyone falling into a black 
<br>
hole a fighting chance. &quot;Although you would feel an infinite tidal force 
<br>
as you approached, you would feel it for only a very short time,&quot; 
<br>
Novikov says. &quot;Consequently, you could pass through without being crushed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, you will have to choose your black hole carefully: it has 
<br>
certainly got to be rotating, for a start. It has also got to be old, so 
<br>
that there has been enough time for the second singularity to form. The 
<br>
final condition is that your black hole is big - very big.
<br>
<p>That's because of the tidal forces. Near the small black holes formed by 
<br>
collapsing dead stars, they are enough to rip a person limb from limb. 
<br>
But these forces depend on the mass of the black hole, shrinking by a 
<br>
factor of 4 each time the mass doubles. So to increase your chances of 
<br>
survival, it is far better to explore a rotating supermassive black hole 
<br>
weighing hundreds of millions of times as much as the sun. &quot;The tidal 
<br>
effect near such a supermassive black hole is far weaker than near a 
<br>
stellar-mass black hole,&quot; Poisson says. &quot;So you would hardly notice as 
<br>
you slip across the event horizon and into the interior.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fortunately, such behemoths do exist. No one is quite sure how they 
<br>
formed but astrophysicists now suspect that supermassive black holes 
<br>
lurk at the heart of every galaxy, including the Milky Way. Our nearest 
<br>
black hole, Sagittarius A*, is rotating, supermassive and old: a perfect 
<br>
candidate for this thrill ride of a lifetime. So, what would the journey 
<br>
be like?
<br>
<p>Although the space-time around you is grossly warped - another way of 
<br>
saying that gravity is immensely strong - you notice nothing untoward 
<br>
happening, just as you don't normally notice the effects of Earth's 
<br>
gravity. To your friends watching you at a safe distance, however, 
<br>
things seem very different. Everything you do is in slow motion as time 
<br>
appears to stretch out interminably. Not only that, but you gradually 
<br>
fade from view as the visible light reflecting off you decreases in 
<br>
energy and frequency. In effect, gravity stretches the light waves, 
<br>
stretching or &quot;red shifting&quot; their wavelengths towards the infrared part 
<br>
of the spectrum.
<br>
<p>Fantastic voyage
<br>
<p>Immediately ahead of you lies the event horizon, the point of no return 
<br>
for in-falling light and matter. Here time appears to slow to a 
<br>
standstill, so your friends see your gradually fading image frozen in 
<br>
space forever. The truth (for you, anyway) is that you have long gone 
<br>
over the event horizon and are falling towards the singularity, the 
<br>
point with infinite density.
<br>
<p>Once you are inside, your passage to the mass-inflation singularity 
<br>
should take only a few hours. Of course, you could prolong your journey 
<br>
by taking a zigzag route in a rocket through space, but the singularity 
<br>
is unavoidable. &quot;By steering, you could extend the journey perhaps by a 
<br>
factor of 10, but no more than that,&quot; Poisson says.
<br>
<p>And what would you find when you got there? So far, no one knows for 
<br>
sure. Many physicists believe that when a star's core collapses to form 
<br>
a black hole, it does not shrink to nothing, but instead spawns a new 
<br>
region of space-time. Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute in Ontario, 
<br>
Canada, for instance, speculates that black holes can give birth to baby 
<br>
universes where the fundamental constants of physics are slightly 
<br>
different. Novikov thinks mass-inflation singularities may act as 
<br>
portals into these regions; if you fall into a black hole you might 
<br>
emerge in a different universe, he says.
<br>
<p>Amos Ori of the Israel-Technion Institute of Technology in Haifa, 
<br>
Israel, is exploring an extraordinary scenario that emerges when he 
<br>
applies general relativity to a simplified black hole model. He 
<br>
considered a two-dimensional black hole containing a mass-inflation 
<br>
singularity. &quot;After crossing the mass-inflation singularity, an observer 
<br>
falling into the black hole will return to the external universe,&quot; he 
<br>
predicts. The bad news is, they will return stretched by an enormous 
<br>
factor and billions of years after they fell in. &quot;Probably no observer 
<br>
will survive this,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many physicists are sceptical that anyone might travel 
<br>
through a black hole unscathed. &quot;We don't know for sure if it is 
<br>
possible to survive crushing,&quot; says Kip Thorne, a theorist at the 
<br>
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. &quot;We don't have enough 
<br>
understanding of the mass-inflation singularity.&quot;
<br>
<p>And even if you do not get crushed, another danger awaits you. Today's 
<br>
universe is filled with completely harmless microwave radiation, the 
<br>
tepid afterglow of the big bang. When these microwaves are sucked into a 
<br>
black hole, they are accelerated to much higher energies and 
<br>
frequencies: these innocuous microwaves get transformed into penetrating 
<br>
gamma radiation. &quot;It is not obvious whether it will be possible to 
<br>
shield someone against these gamma rays,&quot; Ori says, &quot;though there may be 
<br>
a chance.&quot;
<br>
<p>If journeying into a black hole sounds too perilous, Novikov has an 
<br>
ingenious way of looking inside one without venturing too close to the 
<br>
event horizon. His idea is to use tunnels in space-time called 
<br>
wormholes, with one end anchored outside the black hole and the other 
<br>
dangling inside. &quot;Light from the interior could then come out, allowing 
<br>
us to peer inside,&quot; he speculates. The big difficulty would be 
<br>
distorting space-time enough to make a wormhole in the first place. And 
<br>
then there is the problem of keeping it open: wormholes tend to snap 
<br>
shut as soon as they are formed. There has been recent progress this 
<br>
problem, however (see &quot;Peeping through a wormhole&quot;). But since it is 
<br>
impossible to change the topology of space-time, we would have to find a 
<br>
wormhole - possibly one left over from the big bang - then inflate it. 
<br>
&quot;That's a tall order,&quot; Poisson says.
<br>
<p>So maybe the best way to learn about the interior of a black hole is to 
<br>
disregard danger and hurl yourself into one. Of course, whatever you 
<br>
learned, you would never be able to tell your friends about it - even if 
<br>
you survived, you would emerge in another universe or at another time. 
<br>
&quot;But it would be a fascinating trip,&quot; Poisson says. Any volunteers?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Peeping through a wormhole
<br>
<p>Earlier this year, New Zealand and Indian physicists made a dramatic 
<br>
discovery: wormholes may be easier to maintain than we thought.
<br>
<p>Wormholes are perfectly legitimate solutions of Einstein's equations, 
<br>
and could help us look inside a black hole without fear of falling in. 
<br>
But there is a problem: wormholes snap shut in an instant unless held 
<br>
open by a supply of exotic matter. Unlike the familiar stuff found on 
<br>
Earth, which always feels the pull of gravity, this exotic matter can 
<br>
repel gravity, halting the wormhole's collapse. Although recent 
<br>
measurements of the big bang afterglow suggest that the universe is made 
<br>
up of a substance with repulsive gravity, no one knows whether it has 
<br>
the right properties, or even if it exists in the quantities needed to 
<br>
prise open a wormhole big enough to look through.
<br>
<p>But according to Matt Visser of Victoria University in Wellington, New 
<br>
Zealand, things are not as bad as they initially seemed (Physical Review 
<br>
Letters, vol 90, p 201102). The empty space of the quantum vacuum, where 
<br>
fluctuations in energy allow short-lived particles to pop in and out of 
<br>
existence, shares some of the properties of exotic matter. So it may be 
<br>
possible to keep open the mouth of wormhole with much smaller amounts of 
<br>
exotic matter than previously thought. Our chances of a glance inside 
<br>
black holes just went up - very, very slightly.
