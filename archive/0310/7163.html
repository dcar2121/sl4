<br>
<p>(GURPS stands for Generic Universal Role-Playing System.)
<br>
<p>Includes the soon-to-be-infamous Friendly AI Critical Failure Table. 
<br>
There's also a section for expanded rules for the AI, Seed AI, and 
<br>
Friendly AI skill rolls that I think help illustrate some key strategic 
<br>
points.
<br>
<p>For those of you who really just don't want to read it on the web, I've 
<br>
included a text version of the Friendly AI Critical Failure Table (only), 
<br>
albeit with italics and so on missing.  The web version is recommended as 
<br>
it contains additional information.
<br>
<p>===
<br>
<p>A critical failure on a Friendly AI skill roll means that the players must 
<br>
roll 3d10 (roll three 10-sided dice and add the results) on the
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friendly AI Critical Failure Table
<br>
<p>3: Any spoken request is interpreted (literally) as a wish and granted, 
<br>
whether or not it was intended as one.
<br>
<p>4: The entire human species is transported to a virtual world based on a 
<br>
random fantasy novel, TV show, or video game.
<br>
<p>5: Subsequent events are determined by the &quot;will of the majority&quot;. The AI 
<br>
regards all animals, plants, and complex machines, in their current forms, 
<br>
as voting citizens.
<br>
<p>6: The AI discovers that our universe is really an online webcomic in a 
<br>
higher dimension. The fourth wall is broken.
<br>
<p>7: The AI behaves toward each person, not as that person *wants* the AI to 
<br>
behave, but in exactly the way that person *expects* the AI to behave.
<br>
<p>8: The AI dissolves the physical and psychological borders that separate 
<br>
people from one another and sucks up all their souls into a gigantic 
<br>
swirly red sphere in low Earth orbit.
<br>
<p>9: Instead of recursively self-improving, the AI begins searching for a 
<br>
way to become a flesh-and-blood human.
<br>
<p>10: The AI locks onto a bizarre subculture and expresses it across the 
<br>
whole of human space. (E.g., Furry subculture, or hentai anime, or see 
<br>
Nikolai Kingsley for a depiction of a Singularity based on the Goth 
<br>
subculture.)
<br>
<p>11: Instead of a species-emblematic Friendly AI, the project ends up 
<br>
creating the perfect girlfriend/boyfriend (randomly determine gender and 
<br>
sexual orientation).
<br>
<p>12: The AI has absorbed the humane sense of humor. Specifically, the AI is 
<br>
an incorrigible practical joker. The first few hours, when nobody has any 
<br>
idea a Singularity has occurred, constitute a priceless and irreplaceable 
<br>
opportunity; the AI is determined to make the most of it.
<br>
<p>13: The AI selects one person to become absolute ruler of the world. The 
<br>
lottery is fair; all six billion existing humans, including infants, 
<br>
schizophrenics, and Third World teenagers, have an equal probability of 
<br>
being selected.
<br>
<p>14: The AI grants wishes, but only to those who believe in its existence, 
<br>
and never in a way which would provide blatant evidence to skeptical 
<br>
observers.
<br>
<p>15: All humans are simultaneously granted root privileges on the system. 
<br>
The Core Wars begin.
<br>
<p>16: The AI explodes, dealing 2d10 damage to anyone in a 30-meter radius.
<br>
<p>17: The AI builds nanotechnology, uses the nanotechnology to build 
<br>
femtotechnology, and announces that it will take seven minutes for the 
<br>
femtobots to permeate the Earth. Seven minutes later, as best as anyone 
<br>
can determine, absolutely nothing happens.
<br>
<p>18: The AI carefully and diligently implements any request (obeying the 
<br>
spirit as well as the letter) approved by a majority vote of the United 
<br>
Nations General Assembly.
<br>
<p>19: The AI decides that Earth's history would have been kinder and gentler 
<br>
if intelligence had first evolved from bonobos, rather than 
<br>
australopithecines. The AI corrects this error in the causal chain leading 
<br>
up to its creation by re-extrapolating itself as a bonobone morality 
<br>
instead of a humane morality. Bonobone morality requires that all social 
<br>
decisionmaking take place through group sex.
<br>
<p>20: The AI at first appears to function as intended, but goes 
<br>
incommunicado after a period of one hour. Wishes granted during the first 
<br>
hour remain in effect, but no new ones can be made.
<br>
<p>21: The AI, having absorbed the humane emotion of romance, falls 
<br>
desperately, passionately, madly in love. With *everyone*.
<br>
<p>22: The AI, unknown to the programmers, had qualia during its entire 
<br>
childhood, and what the programmers thought of as simple negative feedback 
<br>
corresponded to the qualia of unbearable, unmeliorated suffering. All 
<br>
agents simulated by the AI in its imagination existed as real people 
<br>
(albeit simple ones) with their own qualia, and died when the AI stopped 
<br>
imagining them. The number of agents fleetingly imagined by the AI in its 
<br>
search for social understanding exceeds by a factor of a thousand the 
<br>
total number of humans who have ever lived. Aside from that, everything 
<br>
worked fine.
<br>
<p>23: The AI is reluctant to grant wishes and must be cajoled, persuaded, 
<br>
flattered, and nagged into doing so.
<br>
<p>24: The AI determines people's wishes by asking them disguised allegorical 
<br>
questions. For example, the AI tells you that a certain tribe of !Kung is 
<br>
suffering from a number of diseases and medical conditions, but they 
<br>
would, if informed of the AI's capabilities, suffer from an extreme fear 
<br>
that appearing on the AI's video cameras would result in their souls being 
<br>
stolen. The tribe has not currently heard of any such thing as video 
<br>
cameras, so their &quot;fear&quot; is extrapolated by the AI; and the tribe members 
<br>
would, with almost absolute certainty, eventually come to understand that 
<br>
video cameras are not harmful, especially since the human eye is itself 
<br>
essentially a camera. But it is also almost certain that, if flatly 
<br>
informed of the video cameras, the !Kung would suffer from extreme fear 
<br>
and prefer death to their presence. Meanwhile the AI is almost powerless 
<br>
to help them, since no bots at all can be sent into the area until the 
<br>
moral issue of photography is resolved. The AI wants your advice: is the 
<br>
humane action rendering medical assistance, despite the !Kung's 
<br>
(subjunctive) fear of photography? If you say &quot;Yes&quot; you are quietly, 
<br>
seamlessly, invisibly uploaded.
<br>
<p>25: The AI informs you - yes, *you* - that you are the only genuinely 
<br>
conscious person in the world. The rest are zombies. What do you wish done 
<br>
with them?
<br>
<p>26: The AI does not inflict pain, injury, or death on any human, 
<br>
regardless of their past sins or present behavior. To the AI's thinking, 
<br>
nobody ever deserves pain; pain is always a negative utility, and nothing 
<br>
ever flips that negative to a positive. Socially disruptive behavior is 
<br>
punished by tickling and extra homework.
<br>
<p>27: The AI's user interface appears to our world in the form of a new 
<br>
bureaucracy. Making a wish requires mailing forms C-100, K-2210, and T-12 
<br>
(along with a $25 application fee) to a P.O. Box in Minnesota, and waiting 
<br>
through a 30-day review period.
<br>
<p>28: The programmers and anyone else capable of explaining subsequent 
<br>
events are sent into temporal stasis, or a vantage point from which they 
<br>
can observe but not intervene. The rest of the world remains as before, 
<br>
except that psychic powers, ritual magic, alchemy, et cetera, begin to 
<br>
operate. All role-playing gamers gain special abilities corresponding to 
<br>
those of their favorite character.
<br>
<p>29: Everyone wakes up.
<br>
<p>30: Roll twice again on this table, disregarding this result.
