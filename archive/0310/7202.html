<em>&gt; individuals. For example a machine might not have the concept of pain
</em><br>
<p>my point exactly. qualia are an additional piece of the puzzle, modern
<br>
physics has holes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To even complicate it further, humans at times can enjoy pain and fear,
</em><br>
<p>I think that this confusion arises because we use the same words to mean
<br>
different things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; roller coasters, horror movies, S&amp;M. The AI would have to undertake a
</em><br>
<p>Compare horror movies and being followed by a mob of 25 people trying to
<br>
beat you up (I tried both).
<br>
We call the horror movies scary and the other experience scary, but this is
<br>
a mistake.
<br>
<p>They do not feel the same. What I feel mainly when I watch a horror movie is
<br>
curiosity. It is our curiosity for the dangerous, that is satisfied when
<br>
watching a horror movie. Now that I am not curious anymore, I no longer
<br>
watch them. People trying to break your legs, that is terror, you wouldn't
<br>
want to watch a movie that really terrorized you.
<br>
<p>And S&amp;M. I cannot speak for the whole community since everyone has their
<br>
particular kink or comfort zone or interpretation of it, but &quot;pain&quot; is not
<br>
what it is about. There is a whole range of unique mental states involved in
<br>
consensual power exchange, and if they weren't extremely pleasurable, nobody
<br>
would engage in such an activity.
<br>
<p>Roller coasters: this I really don't understand. Very rapid acceleration and
<br>
deceleration have physiological effects that cannot be controlled even
<br>
though you know that the ride is safe. Roller coasters scare the hell out of
<br>
me and I hate them. I suppose people who enjoy coasters are not terrified
<br>
but enjoy it, so this does not count as real fear.
<br>
<p>Tentative morale of the story: real end-of-the-chain qualia-grade pain is
<br>
never pleasurable. Somewhere between the sensory input [situation commonly
<br>
perceived as painful] and the triggering of the appropriate emotion,
<br>
something can go wrong, for whatever reason, and things that should be
<br>
painful end up feeling pretty good, thank your parents and move on :) Or you
<br>
have a mix of both but the pleasure is intense enough to overcome the pain.
<br>
<p>One more in favour of the &quot;figure out qualia&quot; subgoal : we want an AI to
<br>
look at beings and say, this guy is in pain, this one is having a ball. Etc.
