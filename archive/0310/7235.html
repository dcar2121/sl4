<p>
I'm proposing a strategy to raise capital by issuing
<br>
'tokens' of a company's future revenue. I think it's
<br>
applicable to a range of futurist technologies like AGI
<br>
and uploading etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From my website:
</em><br>
=========================
<br>
<p>Business Strategy
<br>
<p>Perhaps the single most important obstacle to achieving uploading
<br>
is financing. Most people will agree that it will take at least a few
<br>
decades to achieve. Currently a patent can only last for 20 years.
<br>
A lot of scientists are now doing research directly relevant to
<br>
uploading, but it is very unlikely they will be financially rewarded
<br>
for their contributions. How to remedy this problem?
<br>
<p>We know that uploading technologies will generate huge amounts
<br>
of revenue in the future. On the other hand many of us are not
<br>
actively involved in uploading research due to lack of opportunities
<br>
and funding. What we need is a strategy to 'borrow' from that
<br>
future revenue.
<br>
<p>In order to borrow, we need to guarantee that substantial amounts
<br>
of future revenue can be collected. Therefore we need to create
<br>
a centralized organization (eg a research consortium) for interested
<br>
parties in uploading technologies. This organization will gradually
<br>
accumulate intellectual property, industrial know-how, and competitive
<br>
advantage and thus create barriers to entry.
<br>
<p>Secondly, we need a way to raise capital more effectively. Currently
<br>
what companies do is create intellectual property such as patents
<br>
and then issue stocks which represent the company's assets (equity
<br>
funding). My proposal is to issue tokens of a company's future
<br>
revenue for trading. The advantages of tokens over equity are: 1)
<br>
evaluation of intellectual property will be distributed to token-holders
<br>
rather than relegated to accountants (who must be objective and
<br>
conservative); 2) future revenue does not have a 20-year 'look-ahead'
<br>
limit as with patents.
<br>
<p>=========================
<br>
Any comments/suggestions...?
<br>
<p>Thanks =)
