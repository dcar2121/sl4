Hi folks,
<br>
<p>I had an insight a several weeks ago that may or may not be novel, but a
<br>
cursory Google search doesn't find any obvious mention of it.  I thought
<br>
some of the people who have more in-depth knowledge about neural
<br>
networks might be able to comment on this.
<br>
<p>One of the things that always interested me is the apparent fact that
<br>
the brain is capable of executing complex algorithms without the benefit
<br>
of something that we take for granted on computers: dynamic memory
<br>
allocation for storing transient data.  Nor are there large permanent
<br>
buffer structures in evidence that can be used for this purpose.
<br>
<p>Some background: As most people on this list know, I work on a novel
<br>
class of mathematically-derived universal computer (roughly based in
<br>
algorithmic information theory) that shows a striking convergence with
<br>
what we know about biological neural networks, both structurally and
<br>
behaviorally.  Something that I don't believe I've ever mentioned is
<br>
that it doesn't require dynamic memory to do computation, only for
<br>
additional links and the occasional node when encoding new patterns
<br>
(i.e. permanently learning).
<br>
<p>One thing that has bothered me about the design is that I make use of a
<br>
small number of fixed FIFO-type buffers (arrays in practice) at some
<br>
&quot;edges&quot; inside special nodes (&quot;special&quot; because of the small buffer)
<br>
that mostly exist for synchronization and to make data streams play
<br>
nicely with the network structures but are critically important
<br>
functionally.  From an algorithm elegance standpoint, these buffers are
<br>
cheating and everything about the brain suggests that no literal
<br>
permanent buffer structures that look like this are required for what it
<br>
does.
<br>
<p><p>I spent some time thinking about this problem in general.  I can't
<br>
imagine a functional universal computer without something equivalent to
<br>
transient or &quot;in-flight&quot; data storage area for various purposes, and I
<br>
still required a small number of memory buffers in one place which the
<br>
brain would suggest isn't strictly required.
<br>
<p>It occurred to me that a similar problem was solved at the fuzzy
<br>
boundary of analog-digital electronics many years ago when digital was
<br>
very expensive.  I don't know if these are used much any more, but for
<br>
what we would use digital memory buffers today, they used chains of
<br>
analog voltage &quot;buckets&quot; that would dump the voltage value down a wire
<br>
(often to another voltage bucket), with the dump timing and behavior
<br>
controlled by various external control voltage lines.  These analog
<br>
voltage &quot;bucket brigade&quot; designs were used to synchronize analog signals
<br>
by inducing controllable temporal delays, and were in effect a mechanism
<br>
for doing quasi-buffering of an analog signal without using digital
<br>
memory as we normally think of it. Simple and primitive, but quite
<br>
effective for applications that needed flexible FIFO-type buffering
<br>
behaviors without using digital electronics.  Using these primitives,
<br>
you can build interesting computational circuits that are neither analog
<br>
nor digital in a strict sense.
<br>
<p>With this in mind, it turns out that I was essentially folding a complex
<br>
but otherwise ordinary buffer-less multi-node structure (roughly
<br>
organized in columns/chains) that behaved in a fashion virtually
<br>
identical to the old analog bucket brigade type circuits into the
<br>
current small data buffer for the sake of convenience.  Elegance problem
<br>
solved.
<br>
<p><p>When I went back and looked up some neuroscience papers on column and
<br>
chain structures in the brain, I noticed that there are a lot of
<br>
structures that look very similar to that whole family of analog buffer
<br>
circuits, and in the places I would normally expect to find these kinds
<br>
of buffering structures computationally.  But the references to analog
<br>
buffers I've found (and only a small number of vaguely related papers
<br>
show up on Google), do not seem to be referring to complex multi-neuron
<br>
structures in the way I am.  Looking at some papers, it seems that they
<br>
are looking at the same macro structures, but their thoughts are in the
<br>
wrong place conceptually to see that model pop out.
<br>
<p>I don't deal with neural models much, so I would be interested in the
<br>
comments of someone who does. The more I look into it, the more I have a
<br>
hard time looking at it any other way.  From where I'm sitting, these
<br>
columns of neurons should be able to provide all the dynamic memory
<br>
buffers required for computation, and they show up in all the right
<br>
places.  What's more, you can infer a lot about the function of other
<br>
neural structures by how these things are arranged and connected in the
<br>
same way you would for similar types of circuits, so it would
<br>
potentially be useful for unraveling neural functions at a more macro
<br>
level.
<br>
<p>The list has been slow for a while, so I thought I would throw an idea
<br>
grenade into the room that I'd actually like to hear comments on.  As I
<br>
said, I'm far from the world's greatest expert on neural networks (and I
<br>
think the simulated ones are useless), so in some ways this concept is
<br>
only half-baked.  But it did answer a lingering design/structure
<br>
question in my mind, so it can't be totally stupid.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>-James Rogers
