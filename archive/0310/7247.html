<p><p>It is a little more complicated than that, since you need a little more than
<br>
a delay.  Just because it can be used as a delay (an essential property)
<br>
doesn't mean it has to be used for that literal purpose.  You actually have
<br>
a fair amount of control via side-chains.  It isn't just a simple cascading
<br>
FIFO buffer nor is the cascade necessarily automatic or continuous depending
<br>
on the nature of the side-chain; you can actually execute more complicated
<br>
conditional patterns within it while the sequential values are in-flight.
<br>
It is a slightly strange way to do things, but quite functional.
<br>
<p><p><p>The only reason this even occurred to me is that a few years ago I was
<br>
working on modeling an archaic audio circuit in software that relied on
<br>
analog bucket brigade type circuits and logic.  I thought the whole concept
<br>
was fascinating and peculiar, but nobody has used those in ages since
<br>
digital has been vastly cheaper and better for decades.  It was a very
<br>
short-lived kind of circuit design, and if it wasn't for that project a few
<br>
years ago I probably wouldn't have been familiar with it.
<br>
<p>While those types of circuits are way cool and have somewhat unique
<br>
properties for a physical circuit, there is a reason they never saw much
<br>
use.  The signal-to-noise ratio was relatively poor (at best maybe 8-10 bits
<br>
usable dynamic range typically), something digital could easily trump and
<br>
did so cheaply shortly after these types of circuits became commercially
<br>
viable.  Since these types of circuits can be emulated pretty simply in
<br>
software on digital circuits, little reason existed to continue making the
<br>
real thing for most purposes.
