<p>
I was thinking of a universal pattern recognition machine, something that
<br>
will work to recognize whatever, no matter the stimulus. it will recognize
<br>
automatically configurations with low entropy and high organization in the
<br>
sensory input. The same machine could learn to do audio or video analysis or
<br>
solve problems, whatever.
<br>
<p>I asked myself, in the simplest case, what would it take for a basic layer
<br>
of neurons that are activated with light intensity, to make the next layer
<br>
wire itself to detect edges? It would be great if there was a way to let
<br>
white noise filter itself out and for low entropy configurations to emerge
<br>
spontaneously! This way layer by layer the system would adapt to the
<br>
external reality, modeling anything in it.
<br>
<p>So this is how it would work (!!)...
<br>
<p>1
<br>
let's say we have two adjacent neurons a and b.
<br>
most times the difference between their input will be little since they are
<br>
very close. but at times the difference will be large because there is an
<br>
edge there. so the trick would be, let the next layer rearrange itself so
<br>
that only this unlikely configuration can get through.
<br>
<p>2
<br>
let's say we have two adjacent bits of the image, one has an edge detection,
<br>
the other also has an edge detection. This configuration is quite uncommon,
<br>
because if you take a random point just around an edge detector that fired,
<br>
unless you pick a point that is also on the edge line, this second point
<br>
won't be firing (assuming the edge is sharp). So locally, for a bit of line
<br>
to exist, this is an unlikely situation.
<br>
<p>3.
<br>
let's say we have a spot at which a bit of a line was detected. It is very
<br>
unlikely that from the center point another line will be going in another
<br>
direction. In other words, the neighborhood will contain more empty space
<br>
than space containing bits of lines. Locally, the occurrence of an edge is
<br>
not likely. So an edge filter is what comes out of this stage
<br>
<p>4.
<br>
When we have detected a corner, or a feature, then right next to it there
<br>
will be features and non-features (think of the edge of a cube; in three
<br>
directions we will find more edges, but not in the other directions). Very
<br>
unlikely that in the proximity of a feature there will be another feature,
<br>
so features are grouped together forming superfeatures (imagine the corner
<br>
of a cube plus the three adjacent edges).
<br>
<p>Of course levels can communicate with each other so that if a 3d corner + a
<br>
bit of line for some reason form a low entropy configuration then the system
<br>
will detect this pattern in some way.
<br>
<p>So.... would this algorithm work? Provided there was a way to physically
<br>
filter out the locally commonly occurring configurations and only keep the
<br>
rare ones, of course.
<br>
<p>What if neuron connections were actually weakened by activation? Then,
<br>
during sleep, all connections were strengthened. In this case, rare stuff
<br>
would build strong connections because it wouldn't be so depleted during the
<br>
day time. But very frequently occurring patterns (such as two adjacent
<br>
pixels of nearly the same color) would get weaker and weaker. This would
<br>
explain the need for sleep by the way.
<br>
<p>When we see something every day we stop noticing it; could this mechanism be
<br>
the reason? I am not pushing too hard the neuron weakening hypothesis, but
<br>
the important part is, if there was a way to filter out locally common
<br>
percepts, could a universal pattern detector be built? With many layers,
<br>
would it automatically learn to detect 3d shapes from 2d pictures, to
<br>
account for shadows, occlusions etc?
<br>
<p>This same algorithm could be used to create a mind, I haven't had enough
<br>
time to think about how the layer structure would work, but it would
<br>
probably get its first input from the high level 3d percepts which include
<br>
objects, actions, actors, transformations.... patterns would be detected in
<br>
time between actions and objects, between transformations of objects and
<br>
serotonin release, so that actions probably leading to pleasure would be
<br>
linked all the way down to the steps needed to achieve the pleasure, and
<br>
that's visually based human-style planning.
<br>
<p>So things occurring less often *locally*, are the most important, such as
<br>
any two random things being cause and effect. Things occurring more often,
<br>
such as any two random things being completely unrelated, these are white
<br>
noise and cancel out.
<br>
<p>I will give it some more thought....
