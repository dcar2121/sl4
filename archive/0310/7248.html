<em>&gt;When I went back and looked up some neuroscience papers on column and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chain structures in the brain, I noticed that there are a lot of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structures that look very similar to that whole family of analog buffer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;circuits, and in the places I would normally expect to find these kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of buffering structures computationally.  But the references to analog
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buffers I've found (and only a small number of vaguely related papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;show up on Google), do not seem to be referring to complex multi-neuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structures in the way I am.  Looking at some papers, it seems that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are looking at the same macro structures, but their thoughts are in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrong place conceptually to see that model pop out.

<p>Hi James =)
<br>
<p>1. The delay network idea has been explored from the
<br>
ANN perspective such as Jordan (1992) and Elman (1990)
<br>
networks, etc. They are recurrent, discrete-time networks
<br>
capable of learning temporal sequences. Maybe you knew
<br>
this already, from what you wrote.
<br>
<p>2. In neuroscience, cortical columns as delay networks
<br>
has been proposed to be the basis of the 7+/-2 'working
<br>
memory' [John Lisman] in the prefrontal cortex.
<br>
<p>Also, the hippocampus can retain temporal sequences.
<br>
This has been experimentally observed and modeled.
<br>
During sleep, the hippocampus also seems to 'replay'
<br>
temporal sequences learned during the day.
<br>
<p>3. I think memory mechanisms in the brain probably
<br>
operate on a whole range of time scales. *Also*, it is
<br>
possible that cortical columns can hold delay memories
<br>
and long-term memories at the same time. This is an
<br>
interesting possibility.
<br>
<p>I think AI can learn a lot from cognitive neuroscience,
<br>
but I'm not very familiar with that area....
<br>
<p>Cheers =)
