I agree with many of your points, and not with others.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why have a blank slate moral system?&quot;
<br>
<p>Actually it was just an idea, it doesn't really matter whether it is blank
<br>
or not to start with.
<br>
If we are making a recursively improving AI, it should have a recursively
<br>
improving moral system.
<br>
Start it up with some basic human morality, or start with a blank goal
<br>
system, whichever is easiest.
<br>
The important thing is to allow the AI not to remain stuck in one place but
<br>
to keep improving.
<br>
<p>I think that just as a visual cortex is important for evolving concepts of
<br>
under/enclosed/occluded, having qualia for pain/pleasure in all their
<br>
psychological variation is important for evolving concepts of
<br>
wrong/right/painful/betrayal.
<br>
<p>The AI, without a visual cortex, and if it had access to the outside world
<br>
(nanotechnology?) could still run physics experiments, infer the existence
<br>
of electromagnetic waves, create an array of pixels, and develop a visual
<br>
cortex on its own.
<br>
<p>But would an AI without qualia and with access to the outside world ever
<br>
stumble upon qualia? I don't know.
<br>
<p>While we can stand to have a temporarily blind AI we can't afford to have a
<br>
temporarily selfish/unfriendly AI on the loose. So IF we could incorporate
<br>
some kind of qualia-system in the AI (of course making sure that it had
<br>
complete control over these &quot;emotions&quot;, unlike a human) wouldn't it be a
<br>
good thing?
<br>
<p>However we don't have a clue how to create a qualia module, so that is why I
<br>
wrote that garbage about trusting humans (or better, the basic set of human
<br>
moral laws, as you said) until qualia are developed in _some_ way.
<br>
<p>1. Absorb a refined version of the human moral code until you have qualia
<br>
2. Then, create your own moral code
<br>
<p>does this make sense?
<br>
<p><p>curzio
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Whatever qualia are, they are something emergent from a physical system,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that evolved from a single cell. To understand this an AI
</em><br>
wouldn't
<br>
<em>&gt; need to keep humans around, it could scan our state into it's mind for
</em><br>
closer
<br>
<em>&gt; examination. Even if it did need people around, one should suffice, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much doubt they'd have a very meaningful (or happy) existence. I
</em><br>
suspect
<br>
<em>&gt; we can do better than this, and I think we should try.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think we should try to create an AI that either implicitly (eg.
</em><br>
add
<br>
<em>&gt; extra conditions to &quot;keep humans in the loop&quot;) or accidently (eg. the AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search for understanding qualia is accidently meaningful for it's human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information sources too) does what we think of as meaningful. How about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creating a mind that explicitly wants to make our future meaningful and
</em><br>
good?
<br>
<em>&gt; Why not give the AI the capability to reason about morality as we can,
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; good and bad, better and worse, rather than some minimal bootstrapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system?
</em><br>
