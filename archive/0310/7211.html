Someone in this group suggested that it might be desirable to create a 
<br>
grammar so comprehensive that misunderstandings would no longer happen (at least 
<br>
that's how I remember it, and there have been too many new posts of late for me 
<br>
to recall which post it was). Seems this isn't possible.
<br>
I came across an interesting brief at <A HREF="www.nature.com">www.nature.com</A> relating to this 
<br>
subject. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/030929/030929-6.html">http://www.nature.com/nsu/030929/030929-6.html</a>
<br>
In essence, a speaker prefers fewer words, a listener more, and all human 
<br>
tongues occupy a 'sweet spot' in the middle.
<br>
<p><p>Language evolved in a leap
<br>
<p>Conflicting needs may have driven rapid development of communication. 
<br>
22 January 2003 <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nsu/profiles/aboutus.html#Ball">PHILIP BALL </A>
<br>
<p>Language probably leapt, not crept, from squeaks to Shakespeare, two 
<br>
physicists have calculated. Human communication, they propose, underwent a 'phase 
<br>
transition', like solid ice melting to liquid water.
<br>
<p>The richness of human languages is a fine-tuned compromise between the needs 
<br>
of speakers and of listeners, explain Ramon Ferrer i Cancho and Ricard Solé of 
<br>
the Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona. Just a slight imbalance of these 
<br>
demands prevents the exchange of complex information, they argue. 
<br>
<p>So languages between those of present-day humans and the limited signalling 
<br>
of some animals cannot really exist. There must, at some point, have been a 
<br>
switch from rudimentary to sophisticated language.
<br>
<p>This contrasts with some linguists' view that language evolution was a 
<br>
gradual affair in which new words accumulated steadily. 
<br>
<p>Greek or grunt
<br>
<p>A language that conveyed all information unambiguously, say Ferrer i Cancho 
<br>
and Solé, would have a separate word for every thing, concept or action it 
<br>
referred to. Such a language would be formidably complicated for the speaker: the 
<br>
green of grass, for example, would be represented by a totally different word 
<br>
to the green of sea, an emerald or an oak leaf. But it would be ideal for the 
<br>
listener, who wouldn't have to work out any meanings from a word's context. 
<br>
<p>Ideal for the speaker is a language of few words, where simple, short 
<br>
utterances serve many purposes. The extreme case is a language with a single sound 
<br>
that conveys everything that needs saying. Some might suggest that teenagers 
<br>
prefer this kind of minimal-effort tongue that forces others to figure out what 
<br>
their grunts actually mean. 
<br>
<p>Ferrer i Cancho and Solé have devised a mathematical model in which the cost 
<br>
of using a language depends on the balance between these conflicting 
<br>
preferences<A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nsu/030120/#b1">1</A>. They calculate the properties of the lexicon that requires minimal effort 
<br>
for different degrees of compromise, from exhaustive vocabularies to one-word 
<br>
languages.
<br>
<p>They find that the change from one extreme to the other does not happen 
<br>
smoothly. There is a jump in the amount of communication, from very little to 
<br>
near-perfect, at a certain value of the relative weightings of speaker and hearer 
<br>
preferences.
<br>
<p>Human languages, say the duo, seem to sit right on this sudden change. When 
<br>
it happens, the frequency of word usages develops a distinctive mathematical 
<br>
form, called a power law. The power law disappears on either side of the 
<br>
communication jump.
<br>
<p>It has been known since the 1940s that human languages do indeed show just 
<br>
this kind of statistical distribution of word usage - the social scientist 
<br>
George Kingsley Zipf spotted the power-law behaviour. But it has never been 
<br>
satisfactorily explained before, although Zipf himself speculated that it might 
<br>
represent some kind of &quot;principle of least effort&quot;.
