</em><br>
<p>That doesn't sound like much fun! Although in some respects the chemicals
<br>
released are very similar, its just that in one case you have to fight for
<br>
your life, in the other you can give yourself up to the feelings. Exactly
<br>
the same for S&amp;M, its not really pain that hurts really, its the struggle 
<br>
to avoid injury which hurts. Replace that mob with a group of people 
<br>
chasing you with leather paddles, a group you know will not leave 
<br>
true injury if they catch you, instead of raw fear there would probably 
<br>
be curiousity as well, fear would probably make you run but you'd 
<br>
always kind of wish you hadn't... 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They do not feel the same. What I feel mainly when I watch a horror movie is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; curiosity. It is our curiosity for the dangerous, that is satisfied when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watching a horror movie. Now that I am not curious anymore, I no longer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; watch them. People trying to break your legs, that is terror, you wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to watch a movie that really terrorized you.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that would suck!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And S&amp;M. I cannot speak for the whole community since everyone has their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular kink or comfort zone or interpretation of it, but &quot;pain&quot; is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what it is about. There is a whole range of unique mental states involved in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consensual power exchange, and if they weren't extremely pleasurable, nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would engage in such an activity.
</em><br>
<p>Eventhough people seem to play at a whole bunch of different levels, and 
<br>
the pain-&gt;pleasure crossover seems to be possible at a whole bunch of
<br>
different points. There are alot of things which seem extremely unpleasant
<br>
to me (like twisted mind games) which others enjoy. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Roller coasters: this I really don't understand. Very rapid acceleration and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deceleration have physiological effects that cannot be controlled even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though you know that the ride is safe. Roller coasters scare the hell out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me and I hate them. I suppose people who enjoy coasters are not terrified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but enjoy it, so this does not count as real fear.
</em><br>
<p>Or possibly there reaction to the fear is different. I don't enjoy them 
<br>
either, but suspect if I worked my way up with smaller ones with enough
<br>
practice I'd learn to redirect that fear in a pleasant direction 
<br>
eventually.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tentative morale of the story: real end-of-the-chain qualia-grade pain is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never pleasurable. Somewhere between the sensory input [situation commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceived as painful] and the triggering of the appropriate emotion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something can go wrong, for whatever reason, and things that should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; painful end up feeling pretty good, thank your parents and move on :) Or you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a mix of both but the pleasure is intense enough to overcome the pain.
</em><br>
<p>But very hard because there are so many levels. Its quite possible that
<br>
for virtually any test of pain based on nerve signals, you could find
<br>
someone who enjoys it rather than hates it :) 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One more in favour of the &quot;figure out qualia&quot; subgoal : we want an AI to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at beings and say, this guy is in pain, this one is having a ball. Etc.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. The poor puzzled thing :) Show it roller coasters, hot spices, 
<br>
S&amp;M scenes, horror movies, or almost anything people do for fun it will 
<br>
decide people are weird.
