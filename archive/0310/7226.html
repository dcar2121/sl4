<em>&gt; I suspect that, indeed, not everything that is important is within the realm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of science.
</em><br>
<p>I'm afraid that I feel uncomfortable with that. Once you dispose of
<br>
the methods of science, there is no way to distinguish true from false
<br>
hypotheses at all. Without such a method for distinguishing the true
<br>
from the false, any hypothesis becomes equally acceptable and we can
<br>
no longer make progress towards understanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, we should distinguish mathematics from science --- some things that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are important and true are within the domain of mathematics, which is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different domain from either subjective experience OR empirical science.
</em><br>
<p>Mathematics in the general sense has nothing to do with the real
<br>
world. Let me explain what I mean by that.
<br>
<p>Mathematics is really just a game that we play with formal
<br>
systems. The connection between any given formal system and the world
<br>
we inhabit can only be established by the methods of science --
<br>
mathematics will not shed any light on the question on its own. In the
<br>
world of mathematics, you can pick any set of axioms you like, and
<br>
different sets can yield very different results -- thus Euclidean and
<br>
the various non-Euclidean geometries. Both are perfectly workably, but
<br>
both cannot simultaneously describe our world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, mathematical truth has a problematic and subtle relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with scientific truth.  Truth is cleanly and easily definable in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical logic.
</em><br>
<p>Given a given set of axioms, sure. However, there is no particular
<br>
reason to pick one set of axioms over another. We humans tend to pick
<br>
axioms based on the notion that they yield a mathematical system that
<br>
we find of use in describing our world, but other mathematical systems
<br>
are just as easy to play with. We only know about the connection
<br>
between given types of mathematical systems and our world through
<br>
empirical testing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regarding qualia and experience, I guess that there are fundamental reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why these are not fully scientifically comprehensible.
</em><br>
<p>If that is true, I'm not sure why we should believe that they exist at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>Lets say that I have two identical humans, but you have somehow
<br>
tinkered with one of them so that he does not experience some sort of
<br>
qualia and the other has been left alone.
<br>
<p>If they behave differently as a result of the different perception of
<br>
qualia, science can then distinguish the qualia through the difference
<br>
in behavior between the people.
<br>
<p>If they do not behave differently (and I include in behavior what
<br>
sensors like PET scanners might perceive about internal brain states)
<br>
then it is hardly obvious that the qualia exist at all. After all, if
<br>
their brain states cannot be externally distinguished, and they do not
<br>
make claims about differing perceptions, in what sense should we
<br>
assume that their internal perceptions should be thought of as
<br>
different?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Science depends on &quot;the same&quot; experiment being runnable by many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different observers (the famous &quot;reproducibility of results&quot;), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet my experience cannot be had by you, can it?
</em><br>
<p>No, but I can duplicate you and then subject you to alterations and
<br>
observe differences in your behavior caused by said alterations. I can
<br>
even control external stimuli perfectly through the use of virtual
<br>
realities and such if need be.
<br>
<p>In any case, I find it difficult to imagine any phenomenon associated
<br>
with the mind that cannot be externally examined by some sort of
<br>
experiment. Your mind is just a product of your brain operating, and
<br>
we can examine the brain in as minute a level of detail as we find
<br>
necessary. We can also (if needed) reproduce you and make alterations
<br>
in you so as to produce controls and replication for the experiment.
