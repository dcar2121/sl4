<p>It's a good idea, but it would never work (at least for humans!).
<br>
Philosophers and Scientists constantly invent new terms which they attempt
<br>
to give rigorous and complete definitions, but if these words become popular
<br>
and come into common use, whatever unambiguous or rigorous definition they
<br>
had is lost (usually within 50 years time at the most). People use words
<br>
fluidly (unlike commands in programming languages), for example, it might be
<br>
cool to insert lots of French or Latin terms in English-texts (if the terms
<br>
are used frequently enough, they become part of the English language!), but
<br>
if you just started inserting LISP or Visual-Basic commands in your C++
<br>
programs, the debugger would dish out some serious punishment to you in
<br>
syntax-errors up the wazzoo! Definition is determined by use, not by
<br>
dictionaries; words will acquire different meanings by being &quot;exapted&quot; by
<br>
various writers / speakers to fill different roles. The protests of
<br>
Grammarians or &quot;Language-Mavens&quot; simply cannot halt the drift of word
<br>
meanings. (As mentioned earlier, Pinker's book &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;
<br>
discusses language-engineering.)
<br>
<p><p>Anyway, Microsoft Word translated:
<br>
<p>&quot;Aoccdrnig to rscheearch at an Elingsh uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in
<br>
waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht
<br>
the frist and lsat ltteer is at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a toatl
<br>
mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae we do
<br>
not raed ervey lteter by itslef but the wrod as a wlohe.&quot;
<br>
<p>As:
<br>
<p>&quot;Occurring to rscheearch at an Flings uinervtisy, it doesn't matter in
<br>
what order the letters in a word are, the only pigment thing is that
<br>
the first and last letter is at the right place. The rest can be a total
<br>
mess and you can still read it outfit problem. This is busier we do
<br>
not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>(All words were replaced with MS Word's first suggestion, since for all
<br>
incorrectly changed words, MS Word never had the correct one on its
<br>
suggested changes-list anyway. For example, for &quot;Elingsh&quot; MS-Word never
<br>
suggested the correct word, &quot;English&quot;. Words for which MS Word has no
<br>
suggestion were not changed.)
<br>
<p><p><p>MS Word did a fair job, but it's only capable of getting the right answer
<br>
for smaller words. Making a program which can translate messed up paragraphs
<br>
like these as accurately as a human can would be very interesting (and
<br>
probably very hard!). Hey, we could have Word-Processing competetions to see
<br>
which programs can translate these jumbled paragraphs the best, how geeky
<br>
would that be?  ;-)

<p><p><em>&gt;   Thanks for the additional notes on this piece, but whether the topic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was actually studied at a university or not, if you understood the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece, it makes its own case.  To a certain degree anyway, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figuring out anagrams sometimes takes considerable effort.  Programming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a spellchecker/grammar checker to check this kind of paragraph would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting, considering the number of permutations needed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   There are similar claims that displaying only the top half of each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letter is similarly understandable, again, based on humans' tendency to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize patterns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I'm personally interested in the number of misunderstandings that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur due to language--the stock market dives if Greenspan uses the
</em><br>
