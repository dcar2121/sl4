<p><em>&gt; When I went back and looked up some neuroscience papers on column and
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures that look very similar to that whole family of analog buffer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuits, and in the places I would normally expect to find these kinds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of buffering structures computationally.  But the references to analog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buffers I've found (and only a small number of vaguely related papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show up on Google), do not seem to be referring to complex multi-neuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt; structures in the way I am.  Looking at some papers, it seems that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are looking at the same macro structures, but their thoughts are in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong place conceptually to see that model pop out.
</em><br>
<p>I can see what you are talking about. We can say that a buffer is 'any method 
<br>
of delaying data without losing it'; simply sending the signal down some 
<br>
neural path which does nothing but return it will do the job. It's well known that 
<br>
nerve signals are very slow compared to electrical impulses in a copper 
<br>
fiber, and in a very large animal (a sauropod dinosaur, for instance) it would take 
<br>
a good chunk of a second for a pain signal from an injury to the tip of the 
<br>
tail to reach the brain 60 feet away. This is probably why these animals had 
<br>
large nerve bundles farther down in the hip area. Even in humans reflexes are 
<br>
much faster for hand controls than foot pedals, which is why one car company is 
<br>
developing a vehicle with all controls on the wheel.
<br>
So column structures in the brain can make a good buffer. I presume the 
<br>
delays are on the order of hundredths of a second, given the distances in the 
<br>
brain. In developmental terms, the structures probably sort themselves out in the 
<br>
prenatal environment, and probably have existed in some form for about as long 
<br>
as animals have found them useful; I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some 
<br>
worms probably had buffers half a billion years ago, as soon as they had a few 
<br>
hundred neurons to play with.
<br>
Incidentally, I have wondered whether the human brain may not depend on sound 
<br>
for a sort of 'basic programming'.
<br>
In utero, no other sensory component is really operative yet (AFAIK), but the 
<br>
constant rhythm of the mother's heart, among other sounds, would seem to 
<br>
comprise almost the whole of the sensorium and, in a sense, almost the only 
<br>
reality the fetal brain has to work with.
<br>
It seemed to me that one possible approach to an AI might be to set up a 
<br>
neural network and develop it in a way fashioned after what we know about human 
<br>
brains, beginning with only aural input and a sort of sensorimotor homunculus, 
<br>
as opposed to simplified visual inputs. Indeed, I spent the better part of an 
<br>
evening toying with the idea of using a robotic baby as the interface, with 
<br>
fully motorized limbs, visual inputs in the eyes, tactile sensors in the skin, 
<br>
and so forth, and the computer itself located in this body or elsewhere with 
<br>
wireless links; the programmers would deal with the AI by literally raising the 
<br>
baby as best they could.
