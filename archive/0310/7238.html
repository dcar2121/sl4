</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm afraid that I feel uncomfortable with that. Once you dispose of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the methods of science, there is no way to distinguish true from false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypotheses at all. Without such a method for distinguishing the true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the false, any hypothesis becomes equally acceptable and we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no longer make progress towards understanding.
</em><br>
<p>I don't find that to be true.  I find I can distinguish truth from falsity
<br>
in many areas of life without applying the scientific methodology.  Science
<br>
is a powerful tool for narrowing down truth (I wouldn't say &quot;finding truth&quot;
<br>
because we never quite get there), but not the only tool.
<br>
<p>Regarding math, I agree with your comments; of course math is not
<br>
intrinsically about the physical world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Regarding qualia and experience, I guess that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why these are not fully scientifically comprehensible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that is true, I'm not sure why we should believe that they exist at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lets say that I have two identical humans, but you have somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tinkered with one of them so that he does not experience some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia and the other has been left alone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they behave differently as a result of the different perception of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; qualia, science can then distinguish the qualia through the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in behavior between the people.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this.  That is because there is some overlap between the
<br>
complementary domains of experience and science.
<br>
<p>However, I don't think that these scientific-experimental &quot;correlates&quot; of
<br>
qualia are the entire meaning and being of the qualia.
<br>
<p>And, there may be two qualia that are VERY DIFFERENT using the internal
<br>
metric of experiential-qualia space, but are very hard (even if not
<br>
theoretically impossible) to differentiate using scientific methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If they do not behave differently (and I include in behavior what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensors like PET scanners might perceive about internal brain states)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it is hardly obvious that the qualia exist at all. After all, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their brain states cannot be externally distinguished, and they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make claims about differing perceptions, in what sense should we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that their internal perceptions should be thought of as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different?
</em><br>
<p>If these two hypothetical people do not report any differences in
<br>
experience, and show no behavioral differences, then of course from an
<br>
external observer's view there is no reason to believe that they have
<br>
different qualia.
<br>
<p>The more interesting case is when two people describe their perceptual
<br>
qualia differently, but in practical situations appear to act as though
<br>
they're experiencing the same thing.  Then you have a question of whether
<br>
their perceptual experiences are different, or merely their style of
<br>
describing and cognizing these experiences are different.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In any case, I find it difficult to imagine any phenomenon associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the mind that cannot be externally examined by some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment.
</em><br>
<p>Empirical correlates of qualia can very often (I hesitate to assert
<br>
&quot;always&quot;) be examined via scientific experiment.  But these empirical
<br>
correlates are not themselves the qualia; qualia belong to a different
<br>
domain of being.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Your mind is just a product of your brain operating, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can examine the brain in as minute a level of detail as we find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary. We can also (if needed) reproduce you and make alterations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in you so as to produce controls and replication for the experiment.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Your mind is just a product of your brain operating&quot; is an interesting and
<br>
valuable and important perspective, but not the only valuable perspective.
<br>
<p>In the remainder of this email, I'll try to outline another perspective for
<br>
you.  This is fairly deep stuff, but I think it's important.  You may well
<br>
take it for a bunch of hoooey, and that's OK.  Please understand however
<br>
that this is a philosophical perspective coming from a very active research
<br>
scientist who values the scientific perspective tremendously.  (I'm
<br>
currently involved mainly with computer science and biology, but I've also
<br>
done some empirical psychology work in the past.)
<br>
<p>Apologies for the unsystematic exposition, but, well, this is an email not a
<br>
philosophical treatise ;-)
<br>
<p>Let's start with the known fact that the individual mind constructs the
<br>
world it &quot;perceives.&quot;  Neuroscience even tells us that: the colors that we
<br>
see in the world bear only indirect resemblance to what's really going on
<br>
out there ... our eyes fill in blind spots, distort sizes and distances,
<br>
etc. etc.  So the neurons and synapses and so forth that make up our &quot;brain&quot;
<br>
are, in this sense, part of a subjectively-constructed world.  The concept
<br>
&quot;brain&quot; is a product of mind, as is each individual brain that we perceive
<br>
in the laboratory.  We have an abstract scientific world-model that tells us
<br>
there is a &quot;real physical brain&quot; underlying the &quot;constructed brain&quot; that we
<br>
perceive with our illusion-building eyes and visual cortex.
<br>
<p>This abstract world-model is built via inference, but it is not built by any
<br>
one of us individually via inference, it is built socially via inference, so
<br>
that each of us is relying on some ideas derived from others via textbooks
<br>
or conversations, in understanding and convincing ourselve of this
<br>
scientific world-model.  In attaching confidence to what we learn via
<br>
textbooks and conversations, we are assuming some validity to the social
<br>
world, which is based primarily on our (largely illusory from a scientific
<br>
view) perceptions of the everyday physical world, which again (from a
<br>
scientific view) are understood as reflections of some underlying world that
<br>
is distorted by our perceptual brains.
<br>
<p>OK -- so what is &quot;real&quot; in all this?  Is it the individually perceived
<br>
world?  Clearly this is not *so* real.  Is it the abstract model world
<br>
constructed by science?  Perhaps this is a little more real.  But if so,
<br>
why?  The abstract model world is not real &quot;because it's definitely proved
<br>
real by empirical data points&quot; -- because, after all, every empirical
<br>
observation is questionable, being part of an at-least-largely-illusory
<br>
everyday-perception-world.  Rather, the abstract model world is &quot;real&quot;
<br>
because it's self-consistent with a high degree of probability.  Whereas the
<br>
everyday world is MUCH LESS self-consistent, since it leads to the
<br>
scientific perspective, which then teaches us that the everyday world is
<br>
illusory, due to blind spots, implicit neural color theories that only
<br>
loosely reflect the outputs of optical instruments that appear to be more
<br>
accurate, etc.
<br>
<p>I'll now introduce a different notion of &quot;mind&quot;: Mind is the &quot;space&quot; within
<br>
which these different &quot;models&quot; and &quot;hypothetical worlds&quot; exist.  The model
<br>
world of science, the individual worlds of each of us, etc.  This space of
<br>
patterns and structures is in a way larger than the scientifically posited
<br>
world, as the world described by science is simply one possible perspective,
<br>
one possible world within it.  Qualia live here in this mindspace,
<br>
interacting/intersecting with but not defined by the scientific world-model.
<br>
<p>Anyway -- for my work on AI engineering, I nearly always take the
<br>
perspective of &quot;mind emerging from brain&quot;, but that doesn't mean I think
<br>
this is the only valuable perspective....  If you adopt the scientific
<br>
reductionist perspective as the only valuable one, you're really limiting
<br>
yourself, in my view.  But hey -- to each his own!! ;-)
<br>
