<em>&gt; Since natural childbirth is so painful for both the mother and child,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and C-section is available to anyone who wants it, why is natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; childbirth still practiced?  (If the mother gains somehow from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience, is it still justified in terms of the pain caused to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child?)
</em><br>
<p>C-section and natural childbirth both lead to the creation of a sentient
<br>
biological being according to an evolved design, in a resource-restricted
<br>
environment, with qualia for physical pain, rejection, disappointment,
<br>
abandonment, resentment, and so forth. Existence of biologically evolved
<br>
entities is _the_ pain machine, _the_ ultimate evil (or if you don't
<br>
believe, at least ponder: &quot;an evil&quot;), even not considering the fact that
<br>
this new entity is itself programmed to reproduce and create an
<br>
exponentially increasing number of pain experiencing beings.
<br>
<p>[moms and dads: so what _should_ one have done if you wanted to be Friendly
<br>
according to the definition of objective morality we are considering? Should
<br>
have waited until nanotech/the golden era/the singularity, then think about
<br>
producing another sentient being (unless it's a Friendly AI or you
<br>
engineered your baby to have IQ 300 and possibly create such AI). ]
<br>
<p>PS: there is some degree of discomfort caused in two beings who are
<br>
programmed to reproduce, when they decide that they won't, for the sake of
<br>
some higher morality. They &quot;lose&quot; something by not being able to satisfy
<br>
their biological imperative. The lesser evil is adopting a child. The
<br>
greater evil is giving birth to a human. The zero-evil scenario is one in
<br>
which either children never experience anguish OR the need for reproduction
<br>
is eliminated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;What does this have to do with anything?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-Robin, whose sister is a midwife.
</em><br>
<p>Good question, I was just about to justify this whole discussion once more,
<br>
since we are at one of the capillary terminations of its implications and
<br>
it's no longer obvious where it came from.
<br>
<p>Well we are trying to weed out possible inconsistencies with an objective
<br>
theory of morality based on the hypothesis that unpleasant qualia can be
<br>
thought of as the universal definition of evil. If we can formulate a
<br>
universal theory of morality based on qualia (such as: ouch!) and no other
<br>
universal theory of morality based on anything else, then there is a
<br>
possibility that qualia are required in order to create a universal theory
<br>
of morality. And in this case it would affect the design of a Friendly AI
<br>
because we would steer it in some way toward first figuring out or
<br>
experiencing qualia, THEN deciding about the fate of the universe.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Other messages have expanded this into distinctions between pain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suffering, and fear.  I'm trying to envision an FAI's difficulty in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discerning where intervention is required/desired.
</em><br>
<p>It would need to be perfectly empathic: by simulating someone's neural
<br>
processes, be able to feel what they are feeling. This probably requires
<br>
figuring out qualia engineering principles.
