Let's not get mystical:  my finite human brain isn't going to attain 
<br>
Rationality.  At the same time, I disagree with you that all such 
<br>
judgments will be intuitive and fallible.
<br>

<br>
A good way to tell if something is rational is to see if it is in some 
<br>
way involved with evolution.  All processes drawing upon rationality 
<br>
that we know of *right now* stem in some way from differential 
<br>
reproduction.  It could very well be that weather patterns draw on 
<br>
rationality, but there is currently no rational evidence in support of 
<br>
this.  The weather has no goal; the weather isn't trying rain harder on 
<br>
London or turn Brazil into a desert.  In short, keep in mind that 
<br>
processes that we currently view as arational could turn out to be 
<br>
rational, but if it's not being considered rational now it's because of 
<br>
a lack of rational evidence.
