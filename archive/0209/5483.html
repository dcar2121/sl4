<p>
Incidentally, this should be common sense, but it deserves to be said 
<br>
explicitly:
<br>

<br>
This is a public forum which will be publicly archived.
<br>

<br>
Do not propose, in this public forum, any security measure which is 
<br>
weakened if the brainwasher anticipates it; discuss it privately using 
<br>
strong cryptography, if at all.
<br>

<br>
Do not propose, in this public forum, any method of attack which you think 
<br>
at least one brainwasher might *not* think of independently; bearing in 
<br>
mind that some people who would like to brainwash AI may well be stupid.
<br>

<br>
Bear in mind that sometimes, talking as if you expect people to do immoral 
<br>
things increases the possibility that they will do so.
<br>

<br>
Finally, try not to contribute to creating a *psychology* (which may 
<br>
spread beyond this mailing list) under which AI is a valuable thing that 
<br>
people can steal and use, as opposed to an independent sentient entity 
<br>
capable of making its own decisions.  Don't use the word *steal*.  Use the 
<br>
word *brainwash* or *pervert*.  First, it is more accurate in terms of 
<br>
visualizing what the attacker has to actually do in order to succeed.  And 
<br>
second, this planet contains many more people who will perk up when they 
<br>
hear about the prospect of &quot;stealing something valuable&quot;, than it does 
<br>
people who will perk up at the far more difficult prospect of 
<br>
&quot;brainwashing a nonhuman mind&quot;.  There are more experienced thieves on 
<br>
this planet than experienced criminal AI psychologists.  If the aliens 
<br>
land tomorrow, more people are likely to say &quot;Let's steal their ship!&quot; 
<br>
than &quot;Let's steal one of the aliens!  We'll study its brain, figure out 
<br>
how to modify its psychology from the outside, and then use it to perform 
<br>
cognitive tasks on which it has better performance than humans.&quot;
<br>
