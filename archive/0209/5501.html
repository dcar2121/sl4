Hi,
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; I suggest you read the Evolutionary Psychology primer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (<a href="http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html">http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html</a>).  Nature vs.

</em><br>

<br>
&quot;Nature vs. nurture&quot; is a pop-sci catch-phrase.  But the question of how
<br>
much a given sort of behavior is biologically vs. culturally determined is
<br>
NOT silliness.  Many very good scientists, who fully understand evolutionary
<br>
theory, spend their careers on questions of this sort.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It would seem that the only solution is to try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accelerate a friendly singularity (friendly intentionally not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; capitalized to denote a more general case).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think that is the only solution.  Only solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios are dangerous when/if the &quot;only solution&quot; fails to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work out.  [Samantha]
</em><br>

<br>
I agree that it's not possible to single out an &quot;only solution&quot; in a
<br>
situation of so much uncertainty.
<br>

<br>
However, that shouldn't stop us from analyzing possible solutions as to
<br>
their estimated probability.
<br>

<br>
And I still think that, based on all the evidence available, the Friendly AI
<br>
route has the highest chance of success, out of all the possibilities
<br>
raised.
<br>

<br>
But I can't make this statement with enough confidence to say that other
<br>
possible solutions shouldn't be avidly pursued too.  As far as I can tell
<br>
right now, they should be.
<br>
