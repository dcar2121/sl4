This is a key statement, Samantha, one that needs more air-time.  I also see
<br>
a Positive/Friendly Singularity, not as an end, but as a point on a
<br>
continuum.  Even though it will be a defining moment, a phase-change for
<br>
humanity, it will not be a terminus... neither a begining nor and end.  The
<br>
depiction of the Singularity as a terminus invites comparison to classical
<br>
apocaloptic visions, or classical utopian visions.  I sincerely hope it will
<br>
be neither.  Rather, it will be totally different from the past, providing
<br>
both new difficulties and new opportunities.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transition is a process already occuring now.  Everything from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here on out to Singularity is part of it.  All of that will
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; many of us arrive there, and to some extent, how Friendly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage is and how friendly all the stages before were.  We can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just shrug off everything till the sweet by and by of Singularity.
</em><br>
<p>I could not agree more.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think the transition guide is the problem.  What may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *if* we get to Singularity and *if* it is Friendly is not what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am most concerned about today or in the immediate future.
</em><br>
<p>I too am unable to narrow my focus solely on to a hypothetical future.  This
<br>
makes me unsuited to tasks requiring that strong focus... which causes me
<br>
some distress.  However, I do what I can within my particular capabilities.
<br>
I suppose what I am getting at is: it will take many kinds of people to
<br>
'bring on' the Singularity soonest.  The narrowly focused ones.  The
<br>
grasshoppers jumping between disciplines.  The visionaries mapping out our
<br>
way ahead.  The communicators spreading the word.
<br>
<p>Let us all play our part and learn from each other along the way.
