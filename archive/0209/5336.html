</em><br>
<em>&gt; Persinger is especially interested in how transient electrical spikes in the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I believe if you look up SQUIDs 
<br>
(<a href="http://boojum.hut.fi/triennial/squid.html">http://boojum.hut.fi/triennial/squid.html</a>)  and can predict 
<br>
effective room temperature superconductors and continued 
<br>
miniturization of electronics that you end up with a quite 
<br>
effective way to watch the brain at work.  I do not agree 
<br>
however that you will find most of the itneresting large scale 
<br>
patterns, for good or ill, simply by mapping the brain at such a 
<br>
level, much less effective  means of accentuating the positive 
<br>
patterns and mitigating the negative ones.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;2:  Collaborative filtering and/or the Earthweb; a means whereby one good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;idea can very rapidly spread to billions and be built upon by thousands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Accelerated memetic evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the Net has already shown us that this is a real possibility. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to work effectively though, we probably need ubiquitous computing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-bandwidth wireless, and sufficient security/authentication so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people feel comfortable with a high degree of intimate real-time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>It can, I believe, work quite effectively long before most of 
<br>
this is in place.  I do agree that security of a kind that is 
<br>
*not* seen as synonymous with zero privacy would be a very good 
<br>
thing fo this and other purposes. I don't know that more 
<br>
ubiquitous computing that a web-app would be absolutely 
<br>
essential at this point and while high-bandwidth wireless is on 
<br>
my shopping list for many reasons I don't think it is essential 
<br>
to an EarthWeb scenario - high bandwidth yes, wireless not 
<br>
necessarily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Or computer-mediated telepathy between 64-node clustered humans whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;prefrontal cortices have learned to talk to one another over meganeuron
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;broadband connections.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a development I'd like to see, but one which would probably freak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out a lot of the population, even if they had no interaction with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clustered humans. We need to watch our backs for approaching peasants with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pitchforks when we begin walking down this road. Scare headline: &quot;When SL0's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Attack!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If they like that then they will just love what happens when we 
<br>
have early neural i/o with wearable computers and ubiquitous 
<br>
high-speed wireless.  Persons so equipped have access to the 
<br>
global computer grid and to one another to a degree that can 
<br>
verge on telepathy  I see no reason it would be limited to 
<br>
specialized 64-node clusters with surgical enhancements.  They 
<br>
would simply be better at it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Some form of transhumanity which can be achieved as rapidly as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;using our existing technological base; that's a big enough hammer.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;don't believe there's much else that *really would* work, however nice it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;sounded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Uplifting the heart and firing the imagination is a crucial part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;reaching enough people, but having a workable strategy comes first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Otherwise the cheering doesn't *accomplish* anything.  Humans like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cheering and will cheer whether or not anything gets done as a result.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;am deeply suspicious of cheering, and I speak as a cheerleader.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that cheering is both necessary and insufficient. In fact, wrongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used it can be downright counterproductive. Homo sapiens in large groups can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be swept up in mass cheering to the point that they abandon reason and go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with surges of emotion.  
</em><br>
<p>What I am talking about hasn't a darn thing to do with 
<br>
&quot;cheering&quot; of this kind and it certainly doesn't have anything 
<br>
to do with Nazi mass-hysteria (below).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a reason why the Nazis favored mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rallies held at night with torches, marching bands, and emotional speeches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to pluck the heartstrings of nationalism, tribalism, racism, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Subtract the racism and similar ideas, replace them with salvation through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faith, change the musical genre, and you're got a Christian fundamentalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revival meeting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>While some revival meetings and equivalent mass therapy programs 
<br>
and so on use explicitly or implicitly certain techniques of 
<br>
mass mental programming, this also has not a damn thing to do 
<br>
with what I was speaking of.
