<br>
<em>&gt;Anyway, here's my latest attempt at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defining rationality in a way that I think you'll like, Ben.
</em><br>

<br>
Sorry to disappoint but I'm going to nitpick a little ;)
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; rationality:  a force in the universe, specifically the BPT,
</em><br>

<br>
I do not think it's reasonable to call Bayes' Theorem a &quot;force&quot;!!
<br>

<br>
It's a mathematical theorem, a modeling tool, and an observed pattern in the
<br>
universe on many different scales...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required for all nonaccidental successes to occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work:  any nonaccidental success, where success is defined as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completion of a process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let U be the set of all processes in the Universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let T be the proper subset of U that is equal to the set of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes in U that work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If x is a member of T, then x draws upon rationality
</em><br>

<br>
You have now created the problem of defining what &quot;work&quot; means, it seems to
<br>
me.  Also of defining &quot;completion.&quot;
<br>

<br>
Any subset of the universe that changes over time may be said to be carrying
<br>
out a &quot;process&quot;.  If the moon crashes into the sun, is this to be considered
<br>
rational?  It's a process which comes to completion....  So by your
<br>
definition, it seems that yes, this is rational.  But this doesn't accord
<br>
with my understanding of rationality at all...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Rationality, the force, is different from rational thought, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consistent application of rationality in your mind.  All thought draws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon rationality, but irrationality is often introduced into thought in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human mind.  Purely rational thought (and no one here claims to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of purely rational thought) would mean making all decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following Bayesian decision theory.
</em><br>

<br>
Purely rational thought would mean making all decisions following
<br>
probability theory (including Bayes' theorem) *based on the universal
<br>
consisting of of all events in the entire universe*.  But this is not
<br>
possible for any finite mind (even if the universe is finite, according to
<br>
Godel's Theorem).
<br>

<br>
For a finite mind, we can't talk about purely rational thought, only
<br>
maximally rational thought -- the closest to pure rationality that any
<br>
system can possibly come with a given finite experience base and finite set
<br>
of resources.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; As an aside, if you're curious why T is a proper subset of U, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the Universe is by default arational and, for example, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formation of stars and planets in no way draws upon rationality; all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those successes were accidental.  The Universe, as far as we know, did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not set out with the goal of creating Earth.
</em><br>

<br>
Making T a proper subset of Universe does not achieve what you seem to think
<br>
it does.  After all, the universe minus one molecule is a proper subset of
<br>
Universe...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;I think that a person's work saving us from jumping through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few hoops will have far less impact than if that same person spent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time working more directly towards the Singularity.
</em><br>

<br>
I think it depends a lot on the particular strengths of the person in
<br>
question...
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave the memetic battles to those like Kurzweil who are interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only SL4 technology.
</em><br>

<br>
Well, as it happens, I *am* interested in many things besides SL4
<br>
technology....  For example, pygmies, Russian literature, peculiar piano
<br>
chords, and cactus flesh and pot-bellied pigs.  [And -- well, no I won't
<br>
even get into that, there may be minors on this list... ;-&gt;]  So what???
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;If you want the Singularity to happen you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be doing what you can to work towards it.
</em><br>

<br>
I personally AM, but I don't believe this is the optimal path for
<br>
everyone...
<br>
