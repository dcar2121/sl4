A number of things have been said on this list that are wrong.  Of 
<br>
course, I might still be wrong, but if I'm wrong enough Eliezer or 
<br>
Michael Raimondi will probably have something to say about it.
<br>

<br>
Rationality is not opposed to many of the things that people have been 
<br>
claiming that it is opposed to.  Rationality is not opposed to `higher' 
<br>
or `altered' states of consciousness per se.  Rationality is only 
<br>
opposed to those things which separate you from reality and from the 
<br>
truth.  To say that rationality is opposed to anything is also a little 
<br>
misleading.  There is no cosmic struggle (that I know of, anyway) 
<br>
between the rational and the irrational/arationl.  The Universe is, by 
<br>
default, arational.  Rationality is a force that some processes draw 
<br>
upon to accomplish work nonaccidentally (evolution and human thought, 
<br>
for example).  There is a struggle in your mind between irrational and 
<br>
rational thought, though.
<br>

<br>
Raising consciousness sounds like part of rational thinking to me.  
<br>
Becoming more aware of reality is essential to rational thinking.
<br>

<br>
Having a certain oneness with the Universe is not opposed to rational 
<br>
thought, either.  Ego-death (death of self image) is a good thing:  it 
<br>
vastly reduces observer-bias.
<br>

<br>
Can things be done now to make acceptance of the Singularity easier?  
<br>
Possibly.  When it actually happens, though, I bet everyone on this list 
<br>
will still be shocked to see it actually happening.  Rather than trying 
<br>
to prepare people for the Singularity, your time would be better spent 
<br>
actually making the Singularity happen by recruiting, raising money, 
<br>
coding AI, etc..
<br>

<br>
Humans are not addicted to Zero-Sum games.  For more information on 
<br>
this, I recommend the excellent book /Zero-Sum/ by Robert Wright.
