BG&gt; &quot;Technology is the only way to overcome it [scarcity thinking]&quot;
<br>
BG&gt; would be an overstatement.
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; However, it does seem pretty clear to me that
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; a) technology is on a path of exponential acceleration
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; b) spiritual advancement of humanity is not
<br>

<br>
Good point.
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; Could b) undergo some kind of threshold effect that would allow it
<br>
BG&gt; to overtake a) ?
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; Sure, it's not impossible.  But unfortunately, I see no reason to
<br>
BG&gt; believe this, other than wishful thinking.
<br>

<br>
That's the sense in which I mentioned self-fulfilling prophecy
<br>
thinking being of possible relevance.  That is, in the absence of
<br>
concrete data, I think it's more productive if I act *as if* people
<br>
can be convinced of the potential for abundance than if I assume they
<br>
cannot.
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; The &quot;hundredth monkey&quot; effect posited by New Agers for some time,
<br>
BG&gt; has yet to be observed en masse..
<br>

<br>
I hadn't heard of this, so I have just received some education via
<br>
Google.  Of course in human societies such effects (including, e.g.,
<br>
&quot;Rubik's&quot; Cube being close-to-simultaneously invented/discovered by
<br>
various parties) can be explained in a number of other ways.
<br>

<br>
That said, I wouldn't altogether discount the possibility of a
<br>
cultural/spiritual revolution, although I don't think it likely.
<br>
One could argue, for instance, that during the last century in the
<br>
West there's been a rapid (exponential?) rise of the number of people
<br>
interested in what's happening in the world at large and with the time
<br>
to fulfill that interest...
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; I agree that it would be BETTER if humanity drastically improved
<br>
BG&gt; itself mentally, emotionally and spiritually before launching the
<br>
BG&gt; Singularity.  I'm just doubting that's how it's gonna go down...
<br>

<br>
Again, I don't think convincing humanity at large is of anywhere near
<br>
the importance as is convincing those in power -- those who have a far
<br>
greater ability, and IMO greater subjective motivation (misguided, but
<br>
present) to stop or divert progress towards universal abundance.
<br>

<br>
I have quite a bit of faith that reasonably intelligent folks can be
<br>
convinced of the possibility of, and their self-interest in,
<br>
abundance, but very little such faith when it comes to those parties
<br>
(people and institutions) accustomed to power.
