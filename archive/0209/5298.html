Hi Justin,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Having been involved with drugs in my youth, I can say with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainty that there are few if any drugs I did not have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privilige to witness or experience the effects, culture, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side-effects of.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure you had a lot of very educational experiences.  However, it's well
<br>
known that the effects of psychedelics are particularly dependent upon &quot;set
<br>
and setting.&quot;  Experiences with psychedelics vary a lot more than
<br>
experiences with, say, cocaine or alcohol.
<br>
<p>For example, taking LSD as an adult with a view toward self-discovery may
<br>
lead to very different experiences than taking it at a Chili Peppers concert
<br>
while stoned &amp; half-drunk...
<br>
<p>I don't know what your particular experiences were, I'm just making a
<br>
general point...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The negative side affects of LSD (other than inspiring irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior and beliefs, bad-trip nightmares, self-mutilation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous behavior) lie in the fact that it functions both as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serotonin re-uptake inhibitor like many drugs, and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychologically addictive.
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;psychological addictiveness&quot; of LSD is definitely a highly individual
<br>
matter.  Unlike, say, the physical addictiveness of nicotine or heroin.
<br>
<p>I never came close to being psychologically addicted to LSD or any other
<br>
drug, but then I never had an &quot;addictive personality' generally.
<br>
<p>I took LSD a half dozen times over a period of a few years, and stopped
<br>
about 13 years ago.  There was no &quot;psychological withdrawal&quot;, I just felt
<br>
I'd had enough of that state of mind.  I was pleased to know that kind of
<br>
bliss and understanding existed, but was more interested in realizing it via
<br>
&quot;real life&quot; than in finding it thru a drug...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This above discussion ignores the fact that most psychoactive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substances are illegal in many countries, and the available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; streetdrugs are of uncertain composition, and often arbitrary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dosage. The wisdom of ingesting completely unknown substances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advertised as psychoactive drugs obtained from people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smuggle, steal, murder, and write incoherent poetry occasionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a decision entirely seperate from the inherent toxicity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed makeup of said drugs.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this, and I said as much in my earlier message on the topic....
<br>
<p><p>-- ben g
