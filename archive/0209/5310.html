<em>&gt; &gt; To clarify, by &quot;people and organizations in a position of privilege&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't mean the (say) approx. 10% of the world population in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relative position of privilege.  I mean the, what, &lt;1% who &quot;have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power&quot; over the rest, and who I fear are close-to-chronically addicted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to such power (and its corresponding belief that one is not doing well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unless others are doing worse, or any other number of metaphors for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; higher/lower status).  My concern rests both on that entrenched if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incorrect belief and the real-world power such entities have (to e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shut down research or mobilize public opinion against it).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize that.  The above I believe applies just as much to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.  I suspect some of them will be among the first to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand the benefits of true abundance and shifting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness.  I think you do many of them an injustice when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you assume they are only given by addiction to power and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only happy when others are doing worse.

<p><p>Well, as it happens I've known a handful of very wealthy people (by which I
<br>
mean net-worth $100M - $5B+), and my experience with them is, not
<br>
shockingly, that their psychological makeup is about the same as anyone
<br>
else's.  Some of these have been friends, others just brief acquaintances.
<br>
<p>Now, these people I've known have been businessmen, not politicians.  In one
<br>
case, however, the individual involved exerted a great amount of political
<br>
power in his home country.  Mostly these are people aged 40-50, not Internet
<br>
multimillionaires... some from traditional business domains like
<br>
manufacturing, others from finance, telecom, etc.
<br>
<p>I would say that Samantha is right -- these wealthy biz people I've known
<br>
(who may NOT be a representative sample) are by and large MORE tech-savvy
<br>
than the average American, and are by the nature of their business concerns,
<br>
quite interested in and aware of global trends.  Their wealth is certainly
<br>
not threatened by abundance in any direct way.
<br>
<p>In terms of a psychology of &quot;not doing well unless others are doing worse,&quot;
<br>
it seems to me that these folks do gain a lot of ego boost from their wealth
<br>
and social position.  But they're also intensely involved in vying with
<br>
*each other* for those business deals that you need a huge amount of money
<br>
to get into....  Competition with each other is probably a way bigger
<br>
feature of &quot;super rich guy psychology&quot; than strutting about their superior
<br>
position over the vast bulk of others.
<br>
<p>I think it's very unlikely that the &quot;ruling class&quot; is going to try to shut
<br>
down research on abundance-oriented technologies in any way.  Rather, they
<br>
will hire smart, savvy folks (like us ;) to figure out ways that they can
<br>
profit from such technology -- e.g. by owning the manufacturing and
<br>
distribution networks.  But only once the technologies get very close to
<br>
launch, because among all businessfolk there is a lot of skepticism of
<br>
research ideas until they've become real.
