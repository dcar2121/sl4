<em>&gt; September 11th a day of remembrance?  Perhaps.  If one sentient being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dies, that is a tragedy.  If 3,000 sentient beings die, it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportionally greater tragedy.  But let us also remember that the 3,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who died in the World Trade Center were no more and no less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precious than the other 150,000 people who died on that day; or the day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before; or the day after; or any day throughout humanity's millennia-long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history; for with each of them the universe lost something precious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unique before it had a chance to flower; and yet their lives were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasted, for before they died they carried on the torch that would one day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light the Singularity.  It is a proud and terrible thing to be one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very, very few sentients born before the Singularity; a mixture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of tragedy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and triumph, vulnerability and power.
</em><br>

<br>
Well, I guess that's one way to look at it ;)
<br>

<br>
It is interesting how our different human emotion makeups give us such
<br>
different emotional reactions to things like death and the Singularity
<br>

<br>
If no Singularity ever happens, then as far as I'm concerned, people's lives
<br>
*still* weren't wasted.
<br>

<br>
The Singularity will be the greatest achievement in human history, but yet,
<br>
it doesn't feel right to me to speak of it as if it's the *main thing* that
<br>
keeps human lives from being wasted....  What gives human lives meaning, in
<br>
large part, is the individual moments that constitute their
<br>
life-experience...
<br>

<br>
I don't think that dying before the Singularity is either proud or terrible.
<br>
I definitely don't see the &quot;proud&quot; part -- why be proud about happenstance?
<br>
And the terror of death is balanced by various joys that come along with the
<br>
knowledge of death, in complex &amp; subtle ways....
<br>

<br>
For example, my grandfather is 87 and will die in the next 10 years most
<br>
likely.  He is certainly not proud of this, but nor does he find it
<br>
terrible; he finds it natural and is basically pleased with the life he's
<br>
had, and comfortable with its finitude.  He is nonreligious and believes in
<br>
no afterlife...
<br>

<br>
I find the thought of my own *premature* death or the premature death of my
<br>
family terrifying emotionally, but I don't find death via old age nearly so
<br>
terrifying -- though I do wish to avoid it.  I also think that uploading and
<br>
drastically improving/modifying my mind may turn out being effectively a
<br>
form of death to my current human self, unless I decide to keep a copy of my
<br>
current self around for nostalgia purposes ;)
<br>

<br>
Of course, all this isn't the sort of thing that can be meaningfully argued
<br>
about; these emotional reactions are things we experience, not things we
<br>
reason to....  And ultimately, I think the Singularity is gonna take about
<br>
the same course regardless of the particular flavor of our feelings toward
<br>
it...
<br>
