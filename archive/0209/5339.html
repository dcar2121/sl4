<p>MP&gt; Run Slashcode configured so that no one can create an account.
<br>
MP&gt; That way, everyone is an Anonymous Coward.
<br>
<p>Not quite what I mean...
<br>
<p>MP&gt; Would moderators strip sigs or identifying handles from messages,
<br>
MP&gt; even if users deliberately included them? What about information
<br>
MP&gt; that allows you to infer who the poster is (or claims to be)?
<br>
<p>Like I said, I haven't yet figured out the details.
<br>
<p>Here's a reformulation:  a new discussion board-type technology where
<br>
the anonymous contributions become, through some form of collaberative
<br>
filtering/reordering/reformulation, a _single train of thought_.
<br>
<p>Think of it as an attempt at pre-neural-interface human clustering.
<br>
<p>MP&gt; There's an ACM article called 'Disinformation theory', from
<br>
MP&gt; around 1998, which argues that in an information society,
<br>
MP&gt; no-one should expect anonymous communications to remain
<br>
MP&gt; anonymous forever; if they are complex enough, it will be
<br>
MP&gt; possible to infer the poster's identity.
<br>
<p>Good point...but I'm imagining shorter, smaller fragments of thought
<br>
than would easily allow such analysis (which btw, IIRC is at this
<br>
point on its way to becoming established forensic technique) --
<br>
something on the scale of single paragraphs, single points, &quot;single
<br>
ideas&quot;. 
<br>
<p>My main thrust isn't the anonymity itself, but producing those single
<br>
threads of thought collectively.  Something somewhat akin, perhaps, to
<br>
how two authors can collaborate on a piece of fiction -- refining and
<br>
hammering each paragraph, each chapter, the overall structure until
<br>
neither can even clearly point to &quot;which bits&quot; they wrote.  But with
<br>
more people.  I imagine anonymity as helpful in eliminating ego
<br>
effects; in the right context with the right people it may not be
<br>
absolutely necessary but I'd still opt for it because ego has a way of
<br>
sneaking up on you.
<br>
<p>I still can't nail down the description of what I'm thinking of much
<br>
less come up with a method ;)
<br>
<p>Two things that come to mind as threads to explore: mind mapping
<br>
software (googleable; I've seen better examples than at
<br>
<a href="http://www.visual-mind.com/introd.htm">http://www.visual-mind.com/introd.htm</a> but it'll do for a start),
<br>
the &quot;glass bead game&quot; (also googleable, see e.g.
<br>
<a href="http://www.corewave.com/core/">http://www.corewave.com/core/</a> and check the tour and main map).
