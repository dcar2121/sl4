<p><p>The problem with your example is that the system artificially behaves
<br>
this way.  The poor results of the school system are the direct
<br>
unintended consequences of the laws and regulations that education
<br>
currently happens under.  You are assuming the value of a premise that
<br>
is itself the problem.
<br>
<p>As most people are aware, public education didn't always exist in the
<br>
U.S., with it being implemented as late as 1920 in some States.  Before
<br>
the advent of public education, the US was the most literate country in
<br>
the world, with some states in the mid-19th century boasting literacy
<br>
rates higher than they are today in those same states.
<br>
<p>Massachusetts was among the first states to dabble in public education,
<br>
and opened public schools in the 1830's as an ideological alternative to
<br>
the vast number and range of private schools in operation.  The schools
<br>
were an utter failure, both in terms of the quality of the teaching and
<br>
in their ability to attract even the poorest students even though they
<br>
were free.  The quality of the education provided by these schools was
<br>
regularly savaged by representatives in the State government, a number
<br>
of whom thought the whole idea of public education was a disaster and
<br>
this experiment in an open market proved it.  Even while the public
<br>
schools were free, virtually everyone chose to go to private schools. 
<br>
There is substantial historical writings during that period to this
<br>
effect, as it was a topic of significant discussion.  Note that even the
<br>
poorest children were able to get a private education -- there were many
<br>
free schools around to provide for this.
<br>
<p>As a solution to the problem of the public schools not attracting
<br>
students during the twenty year experiment, the State of Massachusetts
<br>
passed a body of legislation in 1851 that effectively forced most of the
<br>
private schools out of business and mandated school attendance within
<br>
strict guidelines that were designed to favor public schools. Because
<br>
the public education system could not compete on an open market for
<br>
education, the State legislatively eliminated the competition. 
<br>
Massachusetts was the first State to do this, and most of the rest of
<br>
the States copied this model eventually.  It was not a popular decision
<br>
at the time.
<br>
<p>This is one of the cases where we have a long history of both private
<br>
and government provided solutions, as well as significant periods of
<br>
time where both these solutions existed in parallel, allowing people to
<br>
vote with their feet and dollars for what they preferred.  The sad part
<br>
is that even though private education was considered vastly better and
<br>
widely recognized as such at the time when both options were available,
<br>
the government still chose to force people to use public education.
<br>
<p>I did a lot of research (due to a heated argument) on the history of
<br>
education in the U.S. a year or two ago and was amazed at what I found. 
<br>
I have since become avidly against the institution of government-run
<br>
education, as history does not look favorably on it at all and the
<br>
people who actually had an honest choice between the two despised public
<br>
education as an option for the very same reasons that people despise it
<br>
today. It is something that should never have happened, but now that we
<br>
have exceptionally good data points for all cases, nobody has the
<br>
courage to actually switch back to the model that worked best.
<br>
<p>Most people-systems that exhibit pathological behaviors are that way
<br>
because somebody created a rule that makes them that way, regardless of
<br>
the intent of the rule.  
<br>
<p>Admittedly off-topic,
<br>
