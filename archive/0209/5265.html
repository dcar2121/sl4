</em><br>
<p>Regarding psychedelic experience, Samantha wrote &quot;If you haven't been there,
<br>
you can't understand.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is VERY true.  I can't think of any case where an appeal to the
<br>
necessity of experience is MORE true than here.
<br>
<p>Explaining sexuality to someone who's never had sex, and never masturbated,
<br>
would be tough.  But explaining psychedelic experience to someone who's
<br>
never taken psychedelic drugs, or had analogous experiences thru other
<br>
means, is significantly harder.
<br>
<p>However, Eliezer, if you studied the psychopharmacological literature on
<br>
psychedelics, you would understand a LOT BETTER than you seem to now.  There
<br>
is a lot of babble written in this area, but a lot of really interesting
<br>
stuff too (unfortunately, it's often mixed up with the babble!).
<br>
<p>A pretty good book (by a guy who believes a lot of silly stuff) is &quot;Food of
<br>
the Gods&quot; by Terrence McKenna.  He reviews the history of mind-altering
<br>
substances, including psychedelics, nasty ones like heroin, and commonplace
<br>
ones like sugar, caffeine and nicotine.  He also makes an interesting case
<br>
that human consciousness evolved via a kind of symbiosis with hallucinogenic
<br>
mushrooms ;)  [Note that I said an &quot;interesting&quot; case, not one that I fully
<br>
believe!].  I'd recommend Stan Grof's book &quot;Psychedelic Psychotherapy&quot; as
<br>
well [though I don't agree with all his semi-Freudian theories, he does have
<br>
a lot of interesting experience with patients to recount].
<br>
<p>One thing you need to understand very clearly is that &quot;drugs&quot; is a rather
<br>
broad category.  The drugs in the different categories are very different,
<br>
both pharmacologically and experientially.  I'd recommend the handbook
<br>
&quot;Licit and Illicit Drugs&quot; for an overview of basic info here if you've
<br>
missed it somehow.
<br>
<p>Psychedelic drugs (e.g. LSD, mushrooms, mescaline, DMT) do very little if
<br>
any damage to the brain or body.  MDMA (Ecstasy) is an exception, it is a
<br>
psychedelic which seems to be capable of occasional (quite rare) physical
<br>
harm.  Psychedelics do vastly less damage than nicotine or alcohol, but
<br>
that's a weak statement, as those (legal) substances are *extremely*
<br>
physically damaging; the psychedelics really do very little if any damage at
<br>
all, so far as anyone's been able to tell.
<br>
<p>Your analogy of hitting oneself on the head with a sledgehammer is more apt
<br>
for electroshock therapy than for psychedelics, in my view.  Electroshock
<br>
therapy is potentially highly damaging, stuns the mind by overstimulating it
<br>
in a generic way, and can sometimes help really crazy people, for reasons
<br>
that are poorly understood.
<br>
<p>Psychedelics alter the dynamics of your brain in much subtler ways, and they
<br>
make you think, feel and experience in different ways than are normally
<br>
accessible.  They open up states of consciousness as different from the
<br>
normal ones as waking and sleeping are from each other.
<br>
<p>Whether these states of consciousness are useful for achieving goals is,
<br>
from a certain perspective, beside the point, since in these states of
<br>
consciousness, goals are irrelevant.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, having been through these states of consciousness CAN be
<br>
useful for achieving goals, in some cases, if the lessons learned in these
<br>
experiences are appropriately integrated into one's ordinary-consciousness
<br>
life.
<br>
<p>I'm not going to try to evoke the psychedelic experience here in this
<br>
e-mail; if you're curious for an ancient attempt of mine to do so, you can
<br>
check out my website www.goertzel.org, go to the Books page, find the book
<br>
draft &quot;Unification of Science and Spirit&quot;, and look at the last chapter
<br>
which is called &quot;Inspiration and Bliss&quot; and which treats the psychedelic
<br>
experience.  I'm not happy at all with that book draft overall, it seems
<br>
immature and overconfident to me at the  moment, but I haven't found time to
<br>
revise it in the many years since I wrote it, so it's available online for
<br>
what it's worth.  There's nothing in there I profoundly disagree with now,
<br>
though I would now emphasize different things, and say many things
<br>
differently.
<br>
<p>About &quot;not doing it now&quot;, personally, I have not taken LSD for a long time,
<br>
but I've taken mushrooms a couple times in the last few years -- while
<br>
visiting Amsterdam, where mushrooms as well as cannabis &amp; hashish are legal.
<br>
I would eat mushrooms more often if they were legal here in the US: Not
<br>
every day or every week, but I might do it every few months.  (Not that I'm
<br>
rigorously opposed to doing anything illegal ever -- I have my share of
<br>
speeding tickets! -- but the illegality of psychedelics *is* a practical
<br>
disincentive ... in Amsterdam you can just walk into the &quot;smart shop&quot; and
<br>
buy a box of shrooms, whereas in the US one would have to find a drug
<br>
dealer, and the latter is a type of interaction I don't feel like having).
<br>
I still find that getting into that different state of consciousness via
<br>
psychedelic chemicals is interesting and valuable to me -- although it's not
<br>
*necessary* to me by any means.  The shrooms in Amsterdam are a lot milder
<br>
than LSD, or peyote, but they do bring you to the fringes of that same
<br>
universe (I'm speaking of the Stropharia strain; the Psilocybin strain
<br>
available in Amsterdam pretty much just makes you laugh a lot and see some
<br>
colors).  One drawback is that they don't seem to give as &quot;social&quot; of a
<br>
group psychedelic experience as LSD or peyote, however -- it's more of a
<br>
journey into one's individual mind, and the collective mind there-thru.
<br>
<p>One day I'll tell you all the message God sent me in summer 2000 via a
<br>
package of McDonald's French Fries in the Red Light district of Amsterdam
<br>
;-D
<br>
<p>I should note that I drink alcohol very rarely (maybe once a year) and don't
<br>
smoke cannabis or take any other drug regularly.  I enjoy my normal state of
<br>
consciousness, and a couple altered ones I can relatively easily get into
<br>
without chemical assistance; but I also find that psychedelics do something
<br>
different, and worthwhile.
<br>
<p>I'm sorry if my comments on psychedelic experience came across to you as
<br>
&quot;bragging&quot;, Eliezer.  I didn't mean to be bragging.  Actually I just meant
<br>
to be sharing with Samantha, the fact that her &quot;under the skin of reality&quot;
<br>
phrase was VERY evocative for me.  Among other things, this is valuable
<br>
evidence that there is in fact some underlying similarity between the
<br>
psyches of LISP programmers and C++ programmers ;-&gt;
<br>
<p>Also, I don't mean to encourage anyone to fly to Amsterdam and try the
<br>
mushrooms offered there at random.  A friend of mine did this, against my
<br>
advice, and found herself spending a long unpleasant night awaked in her
<br>
hotel room heatedly conversing with several devils and lesser demons.  The
<br>
safest way to take psychedelics for the first time is with an experienced
<br>
guide present.  Personally I violated this rule with my first LSD trip back
<br>
when I was 16, and I didn't have any bad consequences, but I just got lucky.
<br>
<p>And I definitely don't mean to encourage anyone to take illegal drugs.  For
<br>
one thing, there is an annoyingly large risk of contamination.  Psychedelics
<br>
don't cause significant physical damange, but, for instance, I can't say the
<br>
same for the strychnine with which street LSD is sometime laced.
<br>
