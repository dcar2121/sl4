<em>&gt; This is a very interesting point and one that I have pondered

</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual and collective state of consciousness, it becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increasingly crucial that consciousness itself is transformed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using all means possible.  Short of rewiring human brains,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spirituality/philosophy/&quot;consciousness raising&quot; is the fastest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of effecting such change.  You say that it doesn't seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work out.  But I have to ask, have we really tried in the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context of abundance and its radically internal and external
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications?
</em><br>

<br>
It's a worthy goal and a great thought....  I think that a nontrivial number
<br>
of people can be reached in this way, and that this is a good thing.  But
<br>
I'm feeling doubtful that this kind of
<br>
spirituality/philosophy/&quot;consciousness raising&quot; is going to succeed broadly
<br>
throughout the human population, pre-Singularity.  Rather, I'm guessing it
<br>
will be transhumans who display this &quot;raised consciousness&quot; you're talking
<br>
about.
<br>

<br>
Of course, I could be wrong though; the future is notoriously difficult to
<br>
predict, given the irritating limitation in time-directionality that seems
<br>
to be built into our minds' perceptual apparatuses ;)
<br>

<br>
Part of my reasoning here is that I'm a &quot;semi-hard takeoff&quot; advocate.
<br>
Genuine consciousness-raising takes time, and it may well happen that by the
<br>
time abundance DOES trigger big changes in human psychology, real AI has
<br>
already happened and has begun leading the way...
<br>

<br>
Another part of my reasoning is that humans' biological wiring is very hard
<br>
to overcome.  Hell, it's hard enough for me to raise MY OWN consciousness,
<br>
let alone that of others!  By which I mean that the deep spiritual insights
<br>
that we're discussing in this thread, are by no means fully diffused thru my
<br>
personality.  They exist in one part of my  mind, and have had effects to
<br>
various extents on other parts....
<br>

<br>
As I've mentioned before, my wife is a Zen priest, and through this
<br>
relationship I've seen a fair number of people who are involved in trying to
<br>
raise their own and others' consciousnesses.  Some really pure-minded,
<br>
exceptional people -- and also a LOT of examples of self-delusion!!
<br>

<br>
I wonder if humans are generally capable of reacting &quot;rationally&quot; to
<br>
abundance.  I mean, look at the ghettos right now.  In a sense, people
<br>
living in the ghettos of New York right now probably live better than
<br>
aristocrats 100 years ago, what with TV, radio computers, electric heat and
<br>
air conditioning, etc.  But the &quot;culture of poverty&quot; has produced a lot of
<br>
angry and depressed people (though of course there are also plenty of
<br>
mentally healthy and happy people in such neighborhoods), turning to
<br>
dangerous drugs, etc.  So far, abundance has not really been actively
<br>
perceived by the average human mind as abundance.  Will this change when
<br>
abundance passes some threshold level?  Or will our wiring for
<br>
status-seeking and personal-status-evaluation continue to play a leading
<br>
role?
<br>

<br>
I think what you're saying could happen EVENTUALLY if we had a very soft
<br>
takeoff, perhaps the 100-year takeoff that Vinge alluded to in a talk
<br>
recently described on this list....  On the other hand, during that 100
<br>
years we could also see the human race wiped out by biological weapons
<br>
(which don't really work well at the  moment, but will surely be perfected
<br>
as a technology within the next 10-20 years).
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;  What if you could get enough people en
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masse to step beyond scarcity thinking and begin thinking in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of abundance and maximal development and well-being for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone?  It would be extremely and wonderfully powerful.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could turn the tide of a lot of dystopias and impending disasters.
</em><br>

<br>
It would be great, but, that seems to me to be an order of magnitude harder
<br>
problem than creating real AI !!!!!!
<br>

<br>
I'm afraid that humans aren't wired for the kind of &quot;advanced consciousness&quot;
<br>
you're advocating, so that getting more than a few statistical outliers in
<br>
neural space to think this way, is a hell of an uphill climb.
<br>

<br>
I understand that if this were the social norm, then those of us who are
<br>
*partly* &quot;advanced&quot; in our consciousness and partly just plain normal
<br>
selfish humans, would have a pressure in the good direction, as opposed to
<br>
the pressure culture exerts on us now.
<br>

<br>
So your idea is a beautiful one, but similar ideas haven't worked out at all
<br>
in human history so far.  I'm all in favor of genuine efforts to make them
<br>
work, but my guess is still that transhumanity comes first, and peace and
<br>
higher consciousness (among many  many other things, including new problems
<br>
we can't yet foresee!) come after...
<br>

<br>
Of course, we can't KNOW that transhumanity will bring peace and more
<br>
advanced consciousness (as opposed to just greater intelligence), but at
<br>
least we can say that the particular hankerings for violence and status that
<br>
are wired into the human brain will be transcended...
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Spiritual laws exist and are important truths of our existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and development.  They are fundamental laws of that inner side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the balance.  But they are much, much different from some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hoary lists of &quot;Thou Shall&quot; and &quot;Thou Shall Not&quot;.
</em><br>

<br>
And the human mind has proved fairly poor at accurately transmitting these
<br>
laws from generation to generation -- unlike math and scientific laws which
<br>
have been written down quite clearly.  Spiritual laws seem to get mixed up
<br>
with all sorts of cultural and ritualistic stuff as they get transmitted
<br>
through the generations.
<br>

<br>
The impact of the ability to directly transmit hunks of mind from one mind
<br>
to another -- as in the Novamente &quot;Psynese&quot; mechanism -- on collective
<br>
spiritual progress cannot be underestimated.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I think that at least some of us must devote our lives and best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts to the work of transforming/transcending  human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness and institutions.  We can't put all our eggs into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one basket.  Nor do I think we can assume that humans can create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a true Friendly AI seed without to a large extent raising our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own consciousness.   I think it is highly dangerous to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can do a mainly techological and super-rational end-run that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will solve everything and keep us from the need for such efforts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the Singularity does not come rapidly or does not &quot;save us&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite like we hoped it would, then we may well not have time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough for the work at the consciousness level before we succeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in destroying ourselves.
</em><br>

<br>
Yes, I agree, these other kinds of work are also valuable.
<br>

<br>
Personally I find myself much more suited by nature to AI work than to
<br>
raising the consciousness of other humans... but my path is not for
<br>
everyone...
<br>

<br>
While I don't feel at all certain that creating a human-friendly transhuman
<br>
AI will solve everything, I still feel this is the path most likely to
<br>
succeed.  This is because I am a bit cynical about human neural hard-wiring.
<br>
We may see a tendency toward more advanced consciousness, but simultaneously
<br>
we will see a tendency toward more advanced and more easily deployed
<br>
massively destructive weapons technology (bio weapons and others).
<br>
Unfortunately I'm afraid the weapons progress may outpace the consciousness
<br>
progress, and so I'm hoping in my gut (and working to ensure that) the AI
<br>
progress will outpace either...
