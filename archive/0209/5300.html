<em>&gt; All,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   I would like to recommend dropping the thread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SL4 is a list about machine intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while the neuropsychology and sociology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of psychedelia and entheogenic experimentation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a fascinating subject it's just not an appropiate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topic in a forum where the moderator is both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant and willfully so of the firsthand effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the substances. (No offense Eliezar).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Get a PhD in psychology, a decade of intense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meditation, and a lifetimes experience with entheogens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and perhaps you might be qualified to vouchsafe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a quality opinion. Otherwise it's just so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memetic backwash.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Let's drop the subject shall we?
</em><br>
<p>I have no particular emotional vesting in continuing the thread.
<br>
<p>However, I want to stress that I *do* consider it relevant to SL4 topics.
<br>
<p>Also, I don't think the topics on the list need to be narrowly dictated by
<br>
the particular experiences of the moderator.  I don't think that's what
<br>
Eliezer wants.
<br>
<p>Next, I don't have a psych PhD, a decade of intense meditation or a
<br>
lifetime's experience with entheogens.  But I spent a couple years as a
<br>
psych prof, a few years on and off experience with psychedelics, and a
<br>
decade and a half of semi-consistent meditation.  So I'm not your ideal
<br>
expert on the topic, but I do know what I'm talking about.
<br>
<p>I stick by my intuition that psychedelics can provide an alternate way of
<br>
looking at the universe, a perspective outside the normal states of
<br>
consciousness .. a glimpse of something *beyond* the human mind.  They can
<br>
also be used just to get one's jollies, to do nasty things to other peoples'
<br>
minds, etc. etc.
<br>
<p>The Singularity is going to be far further beyond the ordinary human
<br>
mind-state than psychedelics permit, of course.  But that doesn't mean the
<br>
psychedelic experience can't give us some clues.
<br>
<p>One concrete point I'll make in this direction has to do with what I used to
<br>
call &quot;the melting of the self.&quot;  Way back before I ever heard of Vinge or
<br>
his Singularity notion, it occurred to me that technological advance was
<br>
likely to lead to the dissolution of the psychological structure we call the
<br>
self.  Post-Singularity, individuality as we know it may become very
<br>
uncommon.  A large percentage of our individuality is tied to our
<br>
embodiment.  When you have access to sensors over a very wide swath of
<br>
physical reality -- in many cases sharing these sensors with other minds --
<br>
your sense of individuation may cease to exist altogether.
<br>
<p>Another point has to do with the &quot;proprioception of thought.&quot;  So much of
<br>
human psychology is grounded in the fact that we can't introspectively
<br>
observe our own mental processes except in certain cases and with severe
<br>
distortions.  (The fact that introspection is badly distorted has been
<br>
demonstrated by many psychological studies, e.g. on mental arithmetic --
<br>
people think they know how they do mental arithmetic, but studies of the
<br>
timing of their various operations suggest otherwise).  An AGI will have far
<br>
greater thought-proprioception than we do.  The consequences of this for
<br>
psychology are astounding.  We humans are basically built to fool ourselves,
<br>
because we can't see the majority what we're doing inside our minds most of
<br>
the time.  Now, an AGI won't be able to study all of its own thought
<br>
processes constantly, but it will be able to do so at its own discretion....
<br>
<p>In my experience with LSD, way back when, I had direct experience of
<br>
<p>a) existing &amp; thinking in the absence of the &quot;individual self&quot; psychological
<br>
construct
<br>
b) directly observing (probably with immense distortion) many aspects of my
<br>
mental process that were normally opaque to me
<br>
<p>I'm NOT claiming that psychedelics allowed me to see into the
<br>
post-Singularity mode of being.  However, I'm suggesting that they *did* at
<br>
least allow me to dip into some interesting parts of the domain of
<br>
not-ordinary-human-consciousness.  And this gave me a MUCH better intuitive
<br>
feel than I'd had previously, for the arbitrary and limited nature of the
<br>
ordinary human mind &amp; state of mind...
<br>
<p>We need to remember, the Singularity is not primarily about technology.
<br>
Technology is the enabler, but the really dramatic thing is that a totally
<br>
new and fantastic set of states of conscoiusness are going to arise.
<br>
