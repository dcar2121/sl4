<em>&gt; If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change the current sentients, us, too quickly and thouroughly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then you may as well have harvested their carbon and built
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something different from scratch.  Too big a leap and the result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not *me* having transcended a lot of limitations and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering, but someone and something else entirely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
I agree with this sentiment.  However, I often wonder about the
<br>
meaningfulness of the result being &quot;*me* having transcended...&quot; even if the
<br>
transition is gradual.  We humans feel a continuity through our whole lives,
<br>
but, we don't change very much compared to what's going to be coming.  I
<br>
really wonder whether this kind of personality-and-awareness continuity is
<br>
going to be meaingful at all, post-Singularity...
<br>

<br>
Of course, if the continuity doesn't happen, it's no tragedy.  So, unless
<br>
some obvious harm in seeking this continuity emerges, I will seek it, as it
<br>
matches my current aesthetic/moral values...
