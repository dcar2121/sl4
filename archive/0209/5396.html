<em>&gt; Hi Justin,
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The negative side affects of LSD (other than inspiring irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behavior and beliefs, bad-trip nightmares, self-mutilation, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dangerous behavior) lie in the fact that it functions both as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; serotonin re-uptake inhibitor like many drugs, and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; psychologically addictive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
Having taken LSD perhaps 100 times myself in my youth and having
<br>
studied the literature (mainstream, medical and counter-culture) and having 
<br>
worked at drug clinics and crisis intervention centers, I think I can speak 
<br>
pretty reasonably about LSD.
<br>

<br>
I had precisely one &quot;bad trip&quot;.  It was not particularly nightmarish but
<br>
did have frightening content that played on underlying guilt structures in
<br>
a way that was definitely a &quot;bummer&quot; - to say the least.  But it was not
<br>
that difficult to handle by myself.  I have seen some freak-outs in my time
<br>
from acid.  But I have never seen very few where the person needed 
<br>
restraint or to be medically brought down.  The worse freak-outs were from
<br>
people who had strong fears of the drug and/or had it slipped to them 
<br>
unawares.  Understandably, they thought they were losing their mind.
<br>
I have seen only one incident of self-mutilation and that was from someone 
<br>
who was overly fascinated with the surgical details beneath the skin of his 
<br>
hand.  He was also on a mixture of drugs.  I have seen some people who are 
<br>
already diagnosed with various mental conditions have more bad trips or do 
<br>
dangerous things.  But generally not much worse than without LSD. Most of the 
<br>
problems I have seen otherwise from acid were acid
<br>
adulterated with speed or strychnine.  I saw far crazier people and
<br>
people in far more danger and requiring much stronger intervention
<br>
on booze, speed, downers, STP, PCP and so on.   LSD is not 
<br>
psychologically addictive.  As a contrast, pot is  somewhat psychologically 
<br>
addictive.   People are much more likely to self-medicate with pot than LSD. 
<br>
