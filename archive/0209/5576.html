There are a hell of a lot of assumptions going into the piece of reasoning
<br>
you're presenting.
<br>

<br>
For example, you're assuming that bringing the Singularity about earlier is
<br>
automatically better.  (If you're not quite assuming something this extreme,
<br>
you seem to be assuming something close.)
<br>

<br>
Samantha Atkins &amp; Vernor Vinge are two intelligent, Singularity-savvy
<br>
individuals who have argued that an earlier Singularity may not necessarily
<br>
be better.  Perhaps, they've suggested, the Singularity is more likely to
<br>
come off well for humans if we have longer to prepare ourselves for it.
<br>
Samantha has been quite explicit in presenting her reasoning in favor of
<br>
this point.
<br>

<br>
My point of view is actually not that far off from yours.  I think a
<br>
Singularity in 20 years is probably better than one in 50-100 years, because
<br>

<br>
a) I'm fairly pessimistic about the ability of humans to become highly
<br>
ethically advanced without some kind of serious hardware/wetware
<br>
modification...
<br>

<br>
b) I'm quite worried about some particularly ethically un-advanced humans
<br>
inadvertently using advanced technology to destroy the human race (while
<br>
trying to destroy only the parts of the human race they don't like...)
<br>

<br>
But anyway, if one believes that a more ethically, spiritually and/or
<br>
cognitively advanced humanity is more likely to lead to a positive
<br>
Singularity, then one is very well justified in spending one's time focusing
<br>
on helping humanity to achieve these qualities.
<br>

<br>
The use of quantitative estimates of &quot;number of people saved from dying&quot; by
<br>
certain actions is heuristically interesting, but should be taken with  many
<br>
lumps of salt, because there are a LOT of major uncertainties involved in
<br>
all prognostications about the Singularity and the path leading up to it.
