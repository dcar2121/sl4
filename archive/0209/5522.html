Hi Ben,
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Chris, have you traveled much outside the Western world?
</em><br>

<br>
Not to the less developed parts. This interpretation is based on what I 
<br>
have read.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;The true goal of the Singularity is NOT merely to improve human lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is ONE goal.  The advancement of mind in (this part of) the universe to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a new level is also a valid and valuable goal, quite separately from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improvement of human lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If NO human lives were improved at all by the Singularity, but a tremendous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new form of intelligence were created, I'd consider the Singularity very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worthwhile.
</em><br>

<br>
I guess that's a matter of personal preference. I personally consider the 
<br>
first priority of the singularity should be to lift the poorest people of 
<br>
the planet out of poverty.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Finally, it could easily be argued that the job of convincing people the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Singularity is good will be much easier once tech has advanced another 20
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years.  A direct *demonstration* of the superiority of tech-enhanced ways of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;life will go a lot further than any arguments we can pose.  So there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good argument for keeping the evangelism low-key until we truly have tech to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;back it up.
</em><br>

<br>
I think it's valuable to introduce people to the general concepts that the 
<br>
singularity will provide, such as abundance. Not only will this make the 
<br>
transition from pre to post singularity quicker and easier, it will also 
<br>
protect against malicious people's desire to disrupt the process. Take the 
<br>
recording industry association of America example mentioned previously. The 
<br>
natural course of events will (eventually) see music distributed over the 
<br>
internet. However, the RIAA, which is currently opposing the move because 
<br>
it stands to loose money, is fast becoming public enemy number 1.
<br>

<br>
Also, if people can see the general trend and where it's heading they will 
<br>
be more willing to embrace it when it arrives. I think that with the 
<br>
technology that will reach the marketplace in the next 20 years will 
<br>
achieve this goal anyway.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;a) more R&amp;D funding [though industry seems to be doing OK on its own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generally speaking, clearly things could do better -- the world governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could start a few Manhattan Projects for AGI, for example, resulting in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Novamente, SIAI and A2I2 and so forth suddenly getting well-funded]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;b) fewer Luddites, ergo less chance of Singularity researchers getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detonated when S-Day gets nearer...
</em><br>

<br>
I don't trust centralized control as far as I can kick it! Openness is the key.
<br>

<br>

<br>
Chris
<br>
