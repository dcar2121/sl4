SA&gt; What if you could get enough people en masse to step beyond
<br>
SA&gt; scarcity thinking and begin thinking in terms of abundance and
<br>
SA&gt; maximal development and well-being for everyone?  It would be
<br>
SA&gt; extremely and wonderfully powerful.  It could turn the tide of a
<br>
SA&gt; lot of dystopias and impending disasters.
<br>

<br>
BG&gt; It would be great, but, that seems to me to be an order of
<br>
BG&gt; magnitude harder problem than creating real AI !!!!!!
<br>
BG&gt;
<br>
BG&gt; I'm afraid that humans aren't wired for the kind of &quot;advanced
<br>
BG&gt; consciousness&quot; you're advocating, so that getting more than a few
<br>
BG&gt; statistical outliers in neural space to think this way, is a hell
<br>
BG&gt; of an uphill climb.
<br>

<br>
I'm not too sure that it's all that difficult to convince people,
<br>
*given the right tools*.  IMO most reasonably intelligent folks can be
<br>
at the least partially persuaded by the arguments and inventions of
<br>
Buckminster Fuller (such as the World Game), for example.  Robert
<br>
Anton Wilson's speculations on &quot;The RICH Economy&quot; in his novel _The
<br>
Schrödinger's Cat Trilogy_ are pretty persuasive (if simplistic) as
<br>
well, as far as I'm concerned.  (You can search for &quot;RICH Economy&quot; to
<br>
get to the relevant bits in the unauthorized online text of the novel
<br>
at <a href="http://www.dextromethorphan.ws/schroedingers-cat/">http://www.dextromethorphan.ws/schroedingers-cat/</a> )
<br>

<br>
I don't see the problem being, in the end, convincing most people.
<br>
*That* part we can do an end-run around: if you give them abundance,
<br>
the need to convince them of its possibility evaporates.
<br>

<br>
What I see as the largest problem is the people and institutions who
<br>
have the most power in this world: those who run things (aka &quot;The Man&quot;
<br>
or &quot;Them&quot;).  *Their* scarcity- and power-over-others based thinking is
<br>
IMO the gravest danger to achieving any even reasonably equitable
<br>
results from nanotech, AI and similar developments.  The belief that
<br>
in order to enjoy their current 'high' positions, others (other
<br>
countries, other people) must be kept 'low' has been ingrained over
<br>
millenia in the aristocracy -- to the point where some institutions
<br>
and individuals have become, for lack of a better word, &quot;addicted&quot; to
<br>
power as an end in itself.
<br>

<br>
How big would the temptation be for any current superpower to grab the
<br>
first workable nanotech or the first usable general AI and use it to
<br>
wield power over others?  The type of people who freak out over the
<br>
idea that the masses can protect their privacy with 128-bit encryption
<br>
are *not* the folks I'd trust to use nanotech or AI to &quot;advantage all
<br>
without disadvantaging any&quot; (in Buckminster Fuller's terminology),
<br>
even though such technologies clearly can do so.  I also wouldn't
<br>
trust them to *not* swoop down out of the sky and take over your
<br>
lab/company/garage when you've made enough progress to be useful to
<br>
them, but well before you achieve the Singularity.
<br>

<br>
So, scarcity thinking at the top is my concern.  I don't see any easy
<br>
way to change that thinking, so it's something that will have to be
<br>
gotten around.  Call me paranoid (you're ONE OF THEM, AREN'T YOU), but
<br>
I'd say either be prepared to take your research underground once it
<br>
starts really getting somewhere, and/or make sure it's distributed
<br>
enough (e.g., through Open Source, publishing papers, etc.) that it
<br>
cannot be easily contained.
