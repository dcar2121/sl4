<em>&gt; I stick by my intuition that psychedelics can provide an alternate way of

<br>
It is not just an intuition of course.  Psychedelics are one way of 
<br>
experiencing other states of consciousness  I think we make the world 
<br>
artificially small if we assumed that altered states are all pathological or 
<br>
worthless or irrelevant to Singularity.  Few states could be more &quot;altered&quot; 
<br>
than being uploaded. :-)
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; The Singularity is going to be far further beyond the ordinary human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-state than psychedelics permit, of course.  But that doesn't mean the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychedelic experience can't give us some clues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One concrete point I'll make in this direction has to do with what I used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to call &quot;the melting of the self.&quot;  Way back before I ever heard of Vinge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or his Singularity notion, it occurred to me that technological advance was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to lead to the dissolution of the psychological structure we call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the self.  Post-Singularity, individuality as we know it may become very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncommon.  A large percentage of our individuality is tied to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embodiment.  When you have access to sensors over a very wide swath of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical reality -- in many cases sharing these sensors with other minds --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your sense of individuation may cease to exist altogether.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
The current self-image/personality/ego structure is indeed quite likely to 
<br>
dissolve when much of its ground of being changes significantly.   Some 
<br>
traditions, such as Buddhism, have long held that what we normally see as 
<br>
&quot;self&quot; is an illusion   Meditators and others who have done much 
<br>
self-examination often have a good understanding for how much the self is a 
<br>
construct, not the true self or center of consciousness (the observer) and so 
<br>
on.   
<br>

<br>
When *you* are not an advanced primate biological lifeform any longer then 
<br>
much that is derived from that previous state will be superflous.  When 
<br>
scarcity largely is no more then all kinds of beliefs, assumptions, habits of 
<br>
mind will need serious overhaul.  When we perhaps can choose to make the 
<br>
boundaries between our minds more porous selectively even the notion of 
<br>
ourselves as individual might come under modification. 
<br>

<br>
If we have the powers and abilities that we believe will be possible in 
<br>
future states then we also have great need to adjust and modify our 
<br>
emotional/reactive natures, to re-integrate on a quite different basis than 
<br>
normal.
<br>

<br>
For all of these reasons and many more I believe that work on consciousness, 
<br>
on understanding and also on shifting and modifying states of consciousness, 
<br>
is quite crucial to Singularity.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; In my experience with LSD, way back when, I had direct experience of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) existing &amp; thinking in the absence of the &quot;individual self&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychological construct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) directly observing (probably with immense distortion) many aspects of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental process that were normally opaque to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm NOT claiming that psychedelics allowed me to see into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-Singularity mode of being.  However, I'm suggesting that they *did* at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least allow me to dip into some interesting parts of the domain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not-ordinary-human-consciousness.  And this gave me a MUCH better intuitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel than I'd had previously, for the arbitrary and limited nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ordinary human mind &amp; state of mind...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
yes.
