Let me (re)emphasize that I know very little about these issues; I was
<br>
throwing out what I had picked up (by osmosis, more or less) on the
<br>
assumption that you had heard even less than I :)  So I'll defer to
<br>
your knowledge of these issues, but reserve my suspicions about the
<br>
issue in general until I've read more extensively.
<br>

<br>
Nonetheless, a few points I'd like to respond to.
<br>

<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>

<br>
m&gt; In terms of material abundance (if not &quot;paradisiacality&quot;) Eskimo
<br>
m&gt; society is clearly not included. Life in the arctic is and always
<br>
m&gt; has been extremely harsh.
<br>

<br>
I was addressing the supposed absence of scarcity thinking,
<br>
competitive behaviour, etc. rather than material abundance itself.
<br>

<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>

<br>
m&gt; I have not been able to find enough information about Balinese
<br>
m&gt; history amidst all the vacation web page &quot;happy talk&quot; (if you'll
<br>
m&gt; excuse a reference to the old musical &quot;South Pacific&quot;) but I
<br>
m&gt; suspect that neither during its prehistoric period, nor during its
<br>
m&gt; time under Hindu influence, and certainly not under the Dutch
<br>
m&gt; conquest, did Bali exist in a paradisiacal condition.  But that's
<br>
m&gt; just my guess.
<br>

<br>
My (very limited) information on this comes from Gregory Bateson's
<br>
_Bali: The Value System of a Steady State_.
<br>

<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>

<br>
m&gt; Finally, my Baloney Detector goes into the red zone when DeMeo's
<br>
m&gt; cited sources of authority include M. Gimbutas, W. Reich and I.
<br>
m&gt; Velikovsky. None of these pseudo-scholars has a shred of scientific
<br>
m&gt; credibility.
<br>

<br>
I know precious little about I. Velikovsky and even less about M.
<br>
Gimbutas, of whom I've never heard.  But to suggest that Wilhelm Reich
<br>
has not a shred of scientific credibility is IMO unwarranted.  He
<br>
certainly had some extreme/fringe theories, especially later in life,
<br>
but that should not IMO invalidate his other work (on e.g. sexuality).
<br>
(I suppose I should throw out another disclaimer, though: I haven't
<br>
studied psychology, and have not read Reich in depth.)  E.g., to me, the
<br>
idea that social repression and aggression is strongly linked to
<br>
sexual repression is pretty plausible -- a connection I think many
<br>
people intuit.  (This may be the reason I support some unusual
<br>
policies in regards to presidential interns... ;)
<br>

<br>
m&gt; This brief historical tour serves to underline my point that we are
<br>
m&gt; unlikely to significantly change human behavior en mass until we
<br>
m&gt; can transform humanity en mass, which means transhuman
<br>
m&gt; transcendence mediated by our technology which, I believe, will
<br>
m&gt; depend crucially on Friendly AI.
<br>

<br>
Well, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree; that is, if you believe
<br>
&quot;scarcity based&quot; / &quot;zero sum&quot; / &quot;selfish&quot; thinking is so deeply
<br>
ingrained in &quot;human nature&quot; that technology is the only way to
<br>
overcome it.  I have seen it being transcended in individual cases and
<br>
in small circles of people; and I suspect it can even happen to some
<br>
degree in certain subcultures (early hippie movement, rave culture).
<br>
And I am not at all (yet) convinced it hasn't been transcended (or
<br>
absent to begin with) in other or past cultures. 
<br>

<br>
You may turn out to be right, but then again this may be an issue
<br>
where self-fulfilling-prophecy / placebo effects are significant.
<br>
