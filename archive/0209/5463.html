<br>
Yes. Realization of That within which all things are and yet It 
<br>
is not a thing and is beyond all things is truly an overwhelming 
<br>
experience.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So much for mysticism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a geek, neophile, technophile, what have you, my (crude metaphor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahoy!) left brain is fascinated with the Singularity and how to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there: evaluating possible approaches to AI, drawing exponential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; graphs, speculating on nanotech, uploading and the rest.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I wonder if this technical path goes up the same mountain, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the other side, and meets up with the mystical path at the top.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
I believe they do.  I experienced this in a vision (and know I 
<br>
was not on drugs).  The Singularity leads to a Singularity in 
<br>
intelligence, in Being.  We will choose, I believe, sooner or 
<br>
later to merge with that Intelligence.  It will continue to grow 
<br>
until it merges/unites/is all Intelligence - Mind. From it's own 
<br>
perspective I doubt it knows so little about us as to consider 
<br>
our perceived separateness as more than a temporary condition 
<br>
that we will let go of when we are ready.  I don't see how a 
<br>
Singularity could ultimately not lead to such possibilities if 
<br>
it is &quot;Friendly&quot; at all and if the universe is open sufficiently 
<br>
in what Mind can understand and acheive.
<br>

<br>
I believe that even before Singularity the Path of Technology 
<br>
will lead us to the point where we must transcend the 
<br>
evolved-ape phase in some quite crucial ways if we are to 
<br>
survive at all.  If we are going to be able to upload and 
<br>
continue to grow the notion of self must become more fluid.  The 
<br>
distinction between Self and self becomes more obvious.  So, 
<br>
ultimately, the tech path leads to the necessity of some of the 
<br>
same work on consciousness as the spiritual path.  They both 
<br>
lead to a transcending of the strictly animal or evolutionary 
<br>
pre-programmed current state.  The end-states are, I believe, 
<br>
quite similar.
<br>

<br>
I am not at all sure that a fully developed post-Singularity 
<br>
Being did not set up this particular local universe in order to 
<br>
seed new mind/consciousness/Singularity.  This may well be, at 
<br>
that end of the scale, how Mind continues to grow and extend.
<br>

<br>
Speculation, except that I have experienced such Mind for a 
<br>
timeless moment or two.  Having done so I can never truly be 
<br>
skeptical of this eventuality.  And if the eventuality 
<br>
transcends space-time, what then?  Ye olde Alpha and Omega 
<br>
appears, albeit vastly different from anything in Sunday School.
<br>

<br>
That we are separate from That, may be only a local perceived 
<br>
reality in this sliver of non-transcended space-time.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes I wonder whether science and mysticism must meet and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; integrate at some point before the top in order to get all the way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the top -- that place where magic and technology become truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable (not just to those with lesser technology).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
I think that at minimum the seeming war between science and 
<br>
religion will be seen eventually as a misunderstanding and abuse 
<br>
of both.  I think that at minimum  many core spiritual maxims 
<br>
and practices will be found to be essential to our continued 
<br>
growth and wellbeing, much less our transformation &quot;off the meat&quot;.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; BG&gt; However, this &quot;higher self&quot; or &quot;deep self&quot; or &quot;raw core of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BG&gt; awareness&quot; (First as Charles Peirce called it) is not the same as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BG&gt; the &quot;psychosocial self&quot; which individuates us and makes us &quot;who we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BG&gt; are&quot;, in the sense that I am different from Eliezer, who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BG&gt; different from my friend's housecleaner, etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  And I don't know whether it makes sense to think in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual survival past the Singularity.  My psychosocial self, me,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself, &quot;I&quot; -- of course I desire it.  At times that seems like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selfish or fear-based desire though -- akin to an infant not wanting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to leave the womb.  In my own case, I find it hard to clearly separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my fear of death from my fear of pain from my will to survive from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will for Something to survive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<br>
When I was once confronted with such Mind, the everyday &quot;I&quot; was 
<br>
present and yet I was merged into this Mind and experienced from 
<br>
within it.  I saw on one hand my entire history, both known to 
<br>
me and not known to me, past and ever-branching future, as a 
<br>
seemingly &quot;separate&quot; being (the everyday self) laid out.  On the 
<br>
other hand I was That. And I knew I could choose at that moment 
<br>
whether to keep the &quot;mini-me&quot; everyday perspective or let go of 
<br>
it an merge into Mind.  I knew that such merging was infinitely 
<br>
more desirable than anything mini-me would ever experience in 
<br>
the separate state. I knew this not in theory but in experienced 
<br>
obvious reality.  And yet I am still attached to mini-me.  It 
<br>
isn't yet my time.  I am not &quot;done&quot; yet.
<br>

<br>
The merging is not the end of I but is the end, or at least the 
<br>
dismantling of,  the current little self - mini-me - that most 
<br>
of us think of as our &quot;self&quot;. The I is a viewpoint within Mind 
<br>
yet not separate.  That is difficult to describe and every bit 
<br>
as exquisite to experience, even if only fleetingly like I did, 
<br>
as all the mystics say.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Maybe the Singularity will let me *return* to the womb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
Mind contains that experience and infinitely more. Not as 
<br>
separate, discrete events and conditions but as part of a 
<br>
transcending space-time totality.  Yet every atom, every instant 
<br>
is more consciously perceived and understood than can ever be 
<br>
the case when experienced normally as &quot;seperate&quot;.
<br>

<br>
I should shut up.  It is difficult to say what I mean and 
<br>
probably even more difficult to read and get some notion of what 
<br>
I am talking about.
<br>

<br>
Back to our locally experienced and scheduled pre-Singularity 
<br>
programming.
