Force like The Force/The Tao/Buddha-nature.  It is not something that

makes things happen, it is something that must be drawn upon to do

something on purpose.  Without rationality everything is just happy

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Look at the definition of work I just gave you.  If you still think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this could be rational, why?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, when you include your eccentric definition of &quot;work&quot;, then your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of rationality comes very close to my definition of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the &quot;ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments.&quot;  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're calling rationality, I just call intelligence, basically.  The
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of the complexity of the goals achieved, whereas a system with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple goals that achieves them effectively may be called just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a system with very complex goals that achieves them effectively.
</em><br>

<br>
There is such a thing as the rational intelligence of a process, which 
<br>
is to say how much rationality a process draws upon.  Intelligence, 
<br>
though, is only one set of processes that is rational.  I doubt that you 
<br>
would consider evolution to be intelligent in the same way that a human 
<br>
is intelligent, but both draw upon rationality in the same way.
<br>

<br>
Furthermore, in this example, can you think of any way to model or find 
<br>
use of the BPT in a moon crashing into a sun without making unproven 
<br>
claims the universe?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Putting our two perspectives together we find: Rationality is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective goal-achievement, intelligence is about effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complex-goal-achievement.
</em><br>

<br>
I think that this depends on just how complex you mean.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; To me, &quot;truth-finding&quot; emerges as a side-effect of goal-achievement.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finite organism has objective truth, but it has subjective truths that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it achieve its goals.  And from a perspective encompassing an organism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its environment, one can assess agreement btw subjective and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective/environmental truth.
</em><br>

<br>
In a round about way I think you're talking about part of rational 
<br>
thinking:  a focus on true reality rather than subjective reality.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; Well I spent a lot of time this last weekend getting excited about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interactions between 12-bar blues chord progressions and Middle Eastern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scales.  Not boring to me at all, even though not as important in any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the Singularity or my AI work....  And I can get VERY excited about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea of an intelligent musical computer program that one could jam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though it's not as important or exciting as the Singularity...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So what?
</em><br>

<br>
There is a difference between getting excited about cultural activities 
<br>
and getting excited about SL2 technology.
