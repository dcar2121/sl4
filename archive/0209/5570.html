<br>
I don't think it will *overtake* (a) but I think any significant 
<br>
increase in (b) could make our changes of surviving (a) much 
<br>
better. The question then becomes, how much is &quot;significant&quot;?
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; The &quot;hundredth monkey&quot; effect posited by New Agers for some time, has yet to

<br>
Dunno.  There have been large spiritual actions centered around 
<br>
Gandhis and Kings of the world. There are apparent exponential 
<br>
growths in certain kinds of memesets (not all of them by any 
<br>
stretch &quot;good&quot;) at times.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; I agree that it would be BETTER if humanity drastically improved itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mentally, emotionally and spiritually before launching the Singularity.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just doubting that's how it's gonna go down...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
I think there are important connections between what type of 
<br>
Singularity we kick off and how it is perceived and what we do 
<br>
pre-Singularity to adjust our minds to even non-Singularity 
<br>
technology and abundance.  In a world playing the same scarcity 
<br>
games with increasing technology you get faster and faster 
<br>
versions of the game with greater amplitude which is quite 
<br>
dangerous.  You get increasing fear of becoming obsolete, 
<br>
discarded and unable to fend in the face of technological 
<br>
advance.  The Singularity then  could become the ultimate fear. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should the people believe that asymptote of technological 
<br>
progress would change the trend they have struggled with?
<br>

<br>
I also think that we need to learn to think in a much more 
<br>
&quot;holistic&quot; or integral manner with much more real care for the 
<br>
maximization of all individual potentials before we get to 
<br>
Singularity.  Again, I don't see how just getting to Singularity 
<br>
makes this occuring more likely if the groundwork has not been 
<br>
laid.  Sure the Singularity could simply establish this, plus or 
<br>
minus &quot;Transition Guides&quot;, but we need as much of this as we can 
<br>
possibly get beforehand if we are to survive to reach Singularity.
<br>

<br>
I am probably expressing this inadequately.  But I believe that 
<br>
we sometimes make the mistake of overemphasizing the intellect 
<br>
side of SAI and underemphasizing its &quot;heart&quot; - the deep 
<br>
appreciation, caring for, compassion for, nurturing of all.  A 
<br>
god sized being without that would be extremely problematic. 
<br>
Our conceptions of SAI are in danger of being unbalanced in much 
<br>
the same ways that we ourselves lack balance.
<br>
