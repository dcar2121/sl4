<em>&gt; Much though I would prefer to agree with Samantha here about the potential

</em><br>
<em>&gt; compelled by my knowledge of history and by my personal experience in this

<em>&gt; realm to conclude that any such transformation will be small-scale and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual. Like Ben, I think our human shortcomings--what Stewart Brand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls our &quot;human cussedness&quot;--as being hard-wired artifacts of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary origins. We need transhuman transformation to overcome these on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a mass scale. (One or two Gandhis we can get now, but that's not enough.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And, in my opinion, that needed transhuman transformation will not transpire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without some essential tools, the most important of which is Friendly AI.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
Perhaps, while we can't espect a major spiritual transformation, 
<br>
we can expect enough of a shift in beliefs and perceptions that 
<br>
we can re-order some of our institutions, our  economics and 
<br>
parts of our politics and expectations to be based on abundance 
<br>
ratheer than scarcity.  I don't think it requires turning 
<br>
everyone or even thousands into a fully realized master or even 
<br>
a serious spiritual seeker in order to accomplish a real 
<br>
transformation of how many things in this world work (more or 
<br>
less) today.  It does require a new vision of what is possible 
<br>
and some progress on making it real.
<br>

<br>
I don't think so much is so hard-wired that it is beyond our 
<br>
efforts to overcome, transcend or ameliorate some of its 
<br>
effects.  Especially not now as we come to understand our own 
<br>
genome and our own brains. The history of civilization shows 
<br>
that we can overcome to some degree at least, even without such 
<br>
knowledge and the positive effect of increasing abundance.  I 
<br>
don't think it is wired into our evolution that the only way to 
<br>
live is through endless competition for material things even in 
<br>
times of great abundance.  There are certainly many societies in 
<br>
near-paradisical conditions that don't seem to be driven so 
<br>
deeply by evolution in such directions.  I don't think it is 
<br>
hardwired that everything should have a price put on it and be 
<br>
owned by someone, especially not in the realm of information and 
<br>
ideas.
<br>

<br>
I don't agree we have to wait for hardware upgrades to get on 
<br>
with changing some of the base assumptions that are ripping our 
<br>
world apart.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; There are no guarantees that we will succeed in this endeavor. But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice do what have except to try? The alternative is either to go on as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are now until humanity kills itself (or dies off), or else to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcend into transhumanity via a positive Singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
I don't think positive Singularity is just or even primarily a 
<br>
matter of technology.
