I am not so sure these days.  Eliezer and team, afaik, haven't 
<br>
really got moving on implementation.  You know your own status 
<br>
far better than I.  It is an unknown whether &gt;H AI can be 
<br>
produced in the time frame (&lt; 30 years) I believe is the most 
<br>
hyper-critical. And of course it would be really useful if it 
<br>
existed next week.  But no pressure! :-) If it is produced it is 
<br>
another huge unknown if it will be &quot;friendly&quot; in the rather 
<br>
collogial sense of actually being a boon, a freeing of humanity 
<br>
from so many limitations and so much suffering in a positive 
<br>
sense or not.
<br>

<br>
As unlikely as sufficient shift of institutions and people's 
<br>
perceptions and practices are, I think that is at least as 
<br>
likely to work as FAI.  Humans are pretty effective meme 
<br>
carriers. Every little bit of relative sanity in this direction 
<br>
may put off the likelihood of doom a bit longer giving other 
<br>
solutions a chance.  But at the rate we are going today I would 
<br>
not take serious bets that we will be free of very major global 
<br>
war and destruction within this decade.
<br>

<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I can't make this statement with enough confidence to say that other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible solutions shouldn't be avidly pursued too.  As far as I can tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right now, they should be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<br>
Yes.  That is also my conclusion.  I plan to attempt the shift 
<br>
of consciousness approach.  Someone has to.
